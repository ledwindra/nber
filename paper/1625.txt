Serial Correlation of Asset Returns
and Optimal Portfolios for
the Long and Short Term

ABSTRACT

Optimal portfolios differ according to the length of time they are held
without being rebalanced. For the case in which asset returns are
identically and independently distributed, it has been shown that optimal
portfolios become less diversified as the holding period lengthens.
We show that the anti—diversification result does not obtain when asset
returns are serially correlated, and examine properties of asymptotic
portfolios for the case where the short term interest rate, although known at
each moment of time, may change unpredictably over time. The theoretical
results provide no presumption about the effects of the length of the holding
period on the optimal portfolio.
Using estimated processes for stock and bill returns, we show that
calculated optimal portfolios are virtually invariant to the length of the
holding period. The estimated processes for asset returns also imply very
little difference between portfolios calculated ignoring changes in the
investment opportunity set and those obtained when the investment opportunity
set changes over time.

SERIAL CORRELATION OF ASSET RETURNS AND OPTIMAL
PORTFOLIOS FOR THE SHORT AND LONG TERM

Stanley Fischer and George Perlnacchi*

It is frequently said that an asset is a safe investment for the short term
but not for the long term, or that an asset like gold is a good hedge against
inflation in the long run but not in the short run.1

Such statements suggest that portfolio behavior should differ depending on

the length of time for which assets are held. They can be interpreted by
considering the serial correlation properties of asset returns. Suppose the
(logarithm of the) return on an asset follows the first—order autoregressive
process

is identically distributed and serially uncorrelated. Let c2 be the

variance of ' and therefore a measure of uncertainty about the return from
holding the asset over one period.

1Benjamin Klein (1976) drew attention to the issue in discussing the gold
standard in the nineteenth century compared with the current monetary system. He
argued there is less uncertainty about what the price level will be one year from
now than there used to be (prices are more predictable in the short run) but more
uncertainty about what the price level will be in the more distant future (prices
are less predictable in the long run).

period depends on the autoregressive parameter 0. Looking at the variance of the
per period return on the asset as it is held for longer periods, the asymptotic
variance of the per period return is

where N is the number of periods for which the asset is held.
Using the variance of the per period return as a measure of risk, the
riskiness of an asset will depend, through e, on the length of time for which it

is held. For instance, an asset with negative 0 (as is claimed of gold in the
nineteenth century) would be less risky if held for a long period than for a

short period. Assets with positive serial correlation are more risky the longer
they are held. Thus the notion that gold or any other asset has different risk
properties for the long term than for the short term can be understood to refer

to the serial correlation properties of the asset's returns. Table 1 presents
some evidence indicating that returns on bills become more risky relative to
stocks the longer the holding period.2

In this paper we investigate the question of whether optimal portfolios
differ depending on the period for which they are held, with emphasis on the

serial correlation properties of the asset returns. Early analysis of portfolios
held for the short and long term focused on the effects of changes in the
investor's horizon on the optimal portfolio (Mossin (1968), Samuelson (1969)).
No systematic effects of the investment horizon on the optimal portfolio were
found; indeed for the hyperbolic absolute risk aversion class of utility
functions (which include8 those with constant relative risk aversion) optimal
portfolios were shown to be invariant to the length of horizon when asset returns

are identically and independently distributed over time. Individuals with the

same current wealth and same terminal utility of wealth function, belonging to

the specified class of utility functions, would hold the same portfolios whether
they were looking ahead one year or twenty.

In these analyses, all investors are assumed to have the same portfolio

holding period, or interval of time between portfolio actions: they all rebalance
their portfolios once a year, or monthly, or continuously. Goldman (1979)
showed that changes in the portfolio holding period have systematic effects on

portfolio composition. Working with utility functions of constant relative risk
aversion, and with asset returns generated by diffusion processes, he proved that
portfolios tend systematically to become less diversified as the holding period

lengthens.3 Goldman's contribution not only establishes that portfolio behavior
differs depending on the length of time for which assets are held, but also shows
that the key consideration is the portfolio holding period rather than the
investor's horizon.

In this paper we therefore examine the effects of changes in the portfolio
holding period on the optimal portfolio when asset returns are serially

correlated. For the returns processes studied, the expected returns on assets
change over time, thus changing investors' opportunity sets. The hedging terms
made familiar from Merton's (1973) analysis of the effects of a changing
opportunity set on portfolio demands therefore appear in portfolio behavior in

our analysis as well. By using constant relative risk aversion utility functions
we ensure that the investment horizon has no effect on the optimal portfolio.
The analytic results show that serial correlation of asset returns can have
substantial effects on portfolio composition as the holding period changes, and

can significantly change the nature of the results obtained by Goldman. Using

3That there must be some effect of the holding period on the optimal portfolio is
implied by the fact that continuous time optimal portfolios differ from
corresponding discrete time optimal portfolios..

4

aggregate

nominal data we find little serial correlation of either stock or bill

returns, though bill returns display substantially higher serial correlation when

real data is used. Our calculated optimal portfolios turn out to show little
sensitivity to the length of the holding period. We find also that hedging
effects on portfolios are small. This is encouraging news for the use of the
simple one—period CAPM as a good approximation

for optimal pricing and portfolio

decisions.

I.

Preliminaries

1. The Dynamics of Asset Returns
There are two assets, at least one and perhaps both earning uncertain

returns. Returns on the assets are defined by diffusion processes for the change
in the asset's value:

bills. Asset 1 is stocks. Since all the results of interest can be obtained if
only bill returns have a changing expected return, we asse henceforth that

Asymptotically the variance ratio is given by (10).
The important point of (9) and (10) is that two assets may have very

different relative risk characteristics depending on how long they are held. The
change in relative riskiness between (9) and (10) depends on the sign of

(b2p24s2+s4). If this expression is positive, bills are more risky relative to
stocks in the long run than in the short run.
A special case for which portfolio behavior will be examined below occurs
when 520, so that the instantaneous return on bills is knowii with certainty.
However, with

follows a random walk and the asymptotic variance ratio is zero.6

2. The Optimization Problem.
The individual maximizes the expected utility of terminal wealth, WT, where
the utility function is isoelastic:

(11) u(WT)

with

=O corresponding to the logarthmic utility function. This class of

utility functions has the important property that the derived utility function in
a dynamic optimization with portfolio rebalancing also belongs to this class,
with the same

The problem to be solved is now the same
for

the

as

that of

Goldman (1979), expect

different behavior of asset returns. For any given length of holding

period, the investor will maximize the expectation of the derived utility of

wealth function at the end of the holding period. In this isoelastic case, the
derived utility function will be isoelastic with coefficient 3. Thus ignoring
inessential constants, in all cases the portfolio holder faces the problem

and Schwert (1977), Garbade and Wachtel (1978), and Fama and Gibbons

process, which implies the real rate is unbounded above and below.

so long as the utility of consumption function is also isoelastic with

The first and second moments in (17) are in this case proportional to r, the

length of the holding period.

The focus of the analysis is the effects of the length of the holding period

on the composition of the portfolio. In particular, does the lengthening of the
holding period affect the composition of the portfolio? And second, what is the
asymptotic behavior of the portfolio, where the investor has to choose at time
zero a portfolio composition that is not subsequently revised (all returns are
reinvested in the asset that generates them) and the holding period goes to
infinity?

The portfolio composition from the standard Nerton continuous time,

continuous revision formulation plays an important role in the analysis. Denote
by w(O) the portfolio that is optimal when the portfolio is revised continuously.

As is well known, the portfolio demand can be decomposed into an excess return

side of (18)).

These results state that as the holding period lengthens, the portfolio becomes

less balanced. If the share of stocks is originally positive but less than one
half, it tends to fall. If the share of stocks is originally greater than one
half, the share tends to rise.

11sult G3 is that the portfolio tends asymptotically to plunge to complete

specialization unless the original portfolio composition is nearly balanced. In
that case, as Goldman

explains,

the distance from 1/2

magnified by a factor of

11

(i—p)/p.

For

> 0 (utility functions with less risk aversion than the

logarithm) all portfolios plunge asymptotically unless w(O) =

1/2.

As

tends to

minus infinity, the portfolio tends to stay frozen at its original composition,
which is the variance minimizing portfolio.9
The Goldman results are illustrated in Figure 1, which shows the asymptotic

share of stocks, w(°), as a function of w(0) defined in (ie). In Figure 1 it is
< 0; for

assumed that

> 0, the ww() locus becomes vertical at w(O) =

1/2,

and then horizontal at w()1. Proposition G2 asserts that the movement away
from w(0) to w() is monotone with the length of the holding period.

4. The Effects of a Change in the Variance of Bill Returns.
As a preliminary to examining the effects of serial correlation of bill
returns on the sensitivity of the portfolio to the length of the holding period,
it is useful

to

analyze the effects of a change in the variance of bill returns

on the optimal portfolio, w(0), for the continuous portfolio rebalancing, no
serial correlation problem.

The presumption would be that an increase in the variance of bill returns would,

in

this setting, increase the share of stocks in the portfolio. Provided that

portfolio returns are uncorrelated (p120), that is what happens so long as
O<w(O)<1.

However, when

possible that an increase in the variance of

bill returns reduces the share of stocks in the optimal portfolio. To focus on

the effects of a change from bills being a perfectly safe to a

slightly risky asset.

The effect of the change in s2 then depends on the sign of p12(2w(O)—1). If
then the individual will move away from stocks towards bills when the

riskiness of bills rises, if w(O)<1/2. The reason is that an increase in
increases the riskiness of the portfolio. Someone for whom w(O)<1/2 is
sufficiently concerned about risk to be primarily in bills to begin with. When
the portfolio becomes more risky he seeks the shelter of the relatively safer
asset, which in this case is bills.

If w(O)>1/2, then the individuals response to the increase in the riskiness

of bills and the existing portfolio is to move towardstocks. He thus moves in
the direction of the more risky asset: his tendency to take a relatively risky
position has already been signalled by the fact that his portfolio is
predominantly in stocks.

If p12<0, an increase in the riskiness of bills reduces the overall
riskiness of the portfolio and responses are accordingly the reverse of those

described in the preceeding two paragraphs. Thus in response to an increase in
the riskiness of bills an individual may actually move his portfolio into bills.
The direction of response depends on the factors set out in (20).

II.

Portfolio Behavior When Returns are Serially Correlated.

Asymptotic

We now examine the effects of increases in the length of the holding period

on the optimal portfolio when bill returns are serially correlated. To avoid
unnecessary complexity, s2 is set equal to zero, implying that bill returns for

the next instant are known with certainty. However, s4>O, implying that future
interest rates are not known with certainty.10

Thus,

holding

the expected excess return on stocks constant, a smaller

variance of stock returns or larger variance of bill returns tends to lead to
plunging in stocks.

(b) When there is zero correlation between changes in the interest rate and

stock

returns, the effects of serial correlation of bill returns on asymptotic

portfolios are almost entirely as expected. The serial correlation of bill
returns makes bills a risky asset for the long term and tends to reduce their

share in the optimal portfolio. Because asset returns are log—normal, though, an
increase in the variance of bill returns increases the expected return on bills.

When the individual is not very risk averse ( > 0), an increase in the variance
of bill returns without any

other

parameter changing may increase the share of

bills in the portfolio (from zero to one). However, if the expected return on
bills is held constant through an offsetting change in a2, then as (25)" shows,
an increase in uncertainty about bill returns will not increase the share of
bills.

schedule W(°) (schedule for 34*O) is steeper than ww(), and there is a smaller
range of w(O) for which portfolios are diversified asymptotically (compared with

Figure

2).

Comparing (°)

Figure 3(a) with ww(o), it is certainly the case that the

overall riskiness of the portfolios. If w(O) was low to begin with, then
parameter values were such as to reflect relatively great concern about risk —

which is reduced by adding bills to the portfolio.
Figure 3

(b)

describes the asymptotic portfolio when

< 0, so that the

expected return on bills is high when stock returns are low. This should be
expected to lead to more diversification, which is precisely what it does. The

relative positions of points A through E in Figure 3(b) are as shown. However B
and A, or just B may be to the right of the origin. Further, point E is shown to
the right of w(O) = 1, but it may be to the left.
The range between points A and E depends in part on the degree of risk

aversion. For (—n)

large,

A will be at a negative value of w(0) and E will be at

a value of w(O) in excess of unity. In such a case the asymptotic portfolios are
more diversified than w(O). This is the opposite of Goldman's result.
Similarly, the larger in absolute value is a14, (for 14 < 0) the more likely is
the asymptotic portfolio to be diversified for parameter values for which the
portfolio w(0) is not diversified.12
Turning again to asymptotic portfolios for

> 0, it turns out that the

discussion of part (a) above applies exactly. Since these portfolios all plunge,
diversification and covariance are not relevant here.

12The question arises of whether this result occurs because w(0) and not (o) is
being used for comparison. The portfolio 0(o), optimal under the asset dynamics
of this section and with continuous rebalancing is:
w(0) = w(0) +

(1—)s1K
K2/K is a "hedging coefficient", of the same sign

as

Thus for

< 0 and

< 0, '(o) > w(0). The values of(°) for w(0) < 0 therefore certainly
reiaect portfolio diversification that would not occur even if the comparison
were w(0), but values of () < 1 for w(0) > 1 may not reflect diversification in
excess of that occurring in the continued rebalancing problem.

iq

(c) Figures 2 and 3, together with (25)" summarize the effects of uncertainty
about bill returns on the asymptotic portfolio. The results are that increased
uncertainty about bill returns increases the share of stocks when 14 =

0;

that

when 14 > 0, asymptotic portfolio diversification occurs over a more restricted
range of w(O); and that for 0j4 < 0, the uncertainty about bill returns over the
long term increases the share of stocks for w(O) small and decreases the share of
stocks for w(O) large.

For

< 0 and non—plunging portfolios, we can also summarize the above

discussion by using (23) to study the effects of an increase in serial

correlation, or reduction in b2, on the asymptotic portfolio. Since b2 always
enters in the form s4/b2, we can consider the effects of an increase in serial

Comparing (27) with (20), we note that the effect of an increase in the
serial correlation of bill returns (equivalently an increase in the variance of
bill returns) on the asymptotic share of stocks is precisely the same as that of
an increase in the variance of bill returns on the share of stocks in the

portfolio problem with continuous rebalancing. Thus the ambiguities discussed
following (20) apply here too: for p14 = 0, an increase in the variance of bill
returns unabmiguously increases the share of stocks, (as in Figure 2) but for
it is quite possible that an increase in the variance of bill returns

increases the share of bills. This would happen for instance, if p14 > 0 (Figure

increase in 54 may increase the share of stocks. Once more the simplicity of the
Goldman results is lost.

III. Portfolio Behavior with Finite Revision Time Portfolios and Estimated
Return Processes
In general, a closed form solution for the optimal portfolio weight,
cannot be obtained when the revision time, r, is finite, i.e., 0 <

< ,

and

asset returns are serially correlated. However, given values for the coefficient

of relative risk aversion, , and the parameters of the asset returns' stochastic
processes, equations (3) and (4), a numerical solution for '(i)

can

be found

using equation (16). The form of the integrand of equation (16) is well suited
for applying a Gauss—Hermite quadrature formula. After computing a value for the
integral in (16) for given '(t), we can then iterate over values of (t)

until

one is found that satisfies equation (16).
In this section we present calculated optimal portfolios '('r), based on

estimated processes for stock and bill returns. We started by estimating
processes (3) and (4), using weekly data over the period January 1978 to December
1983, a total of 312 weeks. As sho'zn by Tarsh and Rosenfeld (1983), using
returns with a weekly observation interval provides accurate estimates of the
continuous time model parameters of equations (3) and (4) when a discrete time

approximation is used in the estimation process. However, since a price index
series is not available on a weekly basis, equations (3) and (4) are assumed to

describe nominal returns. For the expected rate of return on asset 2, bills, the
annualized yield on outstanding 91 day Treasury Bills with approximately one week

21

to maturity is used.13 Continuing to assume that s2 = 0 enables us to
estimate a discrete time approximation to equation (4) of the form;
(28)

da2(t) =

a2(t)

—

a2(t

- 1) =
b2(a2

a2(t-l)

+

where C4t is distributed N(0, s) and serially uncorrelated over time.
For asset 1, stocks, daily returns from the Standard and Poors 500 Composite
Index were aggregated into weekly returns. Attempts to estimate equations (3)
and (4) by time varying parameter methods with no parametric restrictions led to
highly inaccurate and unreasonable estimates of the parameters of the mean

reversion process (4).1 The difficulty in estimating the parameters of the
expected return process for common stocks stems from the large relative magnitude

of the stock's variance.'5 The dilemma is essentially that of the signal
extraction problem where the signal (expected return) is small relative to the
noise (variance) and hence difficult to identify.
Given these difficulties, we used two alternative models of returns, each a
special case of (3) and (4).

They are:

Model 1: a1 = a1, a constant, as assumed in the text of Section II.
Model 2: Stock returns are serially correlated such that

=

a2

+ a1 —

a2,

i.e., the expected return on stocks is equal to the short term interest rate plus

a constant spread, which might be interpreted as a risk premium. Under this
assumption, from equation (17);

13Data on average bid—ask rates were collected from the Wall Street Journal each
Thursday (Wednesday if Thursday was a holiday) on Treasury bills with
approximately one week to maturity.
Por example, the estimate of b1 in equation (4) was —.2460 with an asymptotic
standard error of .8082.

The estimated value of 2' 0.07, is sufficiently small (particularly
for weekly data) that there is very little serial correlation of nominal bill

returns. The covariance between changes in stock returns and the shifting

mean

of

the interest rate is significantly negative. The standard deviation of

the returns on stocks is one hundred times that of s4; the shifts in the Treasury
bill rate have very small (although statistically significant) variance.
Since the difference between the mean return on stocks and

23

expected return on bills, a1 — a2 can only be estimated with reasonable

accuracy by using data over a long time period, an estimate of the spread was

obtained from Ibbotson and Sinquefield (1982). The means of Standard and
Poors stock returns and Treasury bill returns over the period 1926-1981 were a1 =

.114 and a2 = .031, so we take the estimate of the spread to be .083.

These are very similar to the Model 1 estimates of these same parameters.

Calculated Portfolios: We computed finite revision time portfolio weights
using the point estimates for the returns processes of Models 1 and 2.

Results for Model 1, with serially uncorrelated returns on stocks, are
presented in Table 2 while Model 2 results appear in Table 3.

(In

the w(x)

expressions, x is measured in years.) The calculated portfolios are very
similar in the two tables. The results are:

3. The Goldman plunging results are not applicable over the ranges seen in
the tables. Indeed, with the serial correlation of bill returns, there are

for high values of — movements towards diversification as the holding period
lengthens. In all cases the w(T) portfolio contains more stocks than the
w(O) portfolio. This is in accord with the Goldman anti—diversification
results for values of

greater than —6; for

< —6, the Goldman anti-

diversification and the greater relative riskiness of bills effect stressed

in this paper work in the opposite direction. Asymptotically the increasing
relative riskiness of bills effect dominates anti—diversification, but the
change is not monotonic.

4. The difference between the (O) and w'(O) portfolios is zero to five
places. This means that hedging effects on portfolio demands are negligible
for the processes examined in this paper. That is not surprising given the
small estimates of the serial correlation of bill returns. If such estimates
are reliable, the one period CAPM provides a close approximation to the CAPM
with a changing opportunity set.

An Alternative "Safe" Asset: We calculated optimal portfolios with one week
bills replaced by 91 day bills. With asset 2 a 91 day bill, 2 is not equal
to zero. For this case equation (3) was estimated using weekly new issue
auction yields on 91 day Treasury bills over the same period as before,

January 1978 to December 1983. The expected return was assumed equal to a
proportion of the short rate used previously in estimating (28) plus a

constant. This assumption concerning the form of the stochastic process of
Treasury bills is consistent with the term structure model of Vasicek (1977).
The following point estimates were obtained for the case (Model 1) in which
stock returns were assumed to be serially uncorrelated.

We again calculated solutions for (t)

using equation (16). Table 4

presents the optimal stock holdings for the case in which stocks are assumed to

be serially uncorrelated. Qualitatively, the results for this case for which the
maturity of asset two has been extended are very similar to the results in Table
2 where asset two is the short (i week) rate.
Essentially the same situation is found when stock returns are assumed

to be serially correlated. The results in Table 5 give @r) for serially
correlated stock returns and asset two being 91 day bills. The monotonicity
results of Goldman (1979) again do not hold. As in Tables 2 and 3 there is very
little change in magnitude between w(0) and

Estimation Using Real Asset Returns: Models 1 and 2 were re—estimated using real

returns data and a monthly observation interval. Equations (3) and (4) are
perhaps a more attractive returns generating process when returns are assumed to

be in real terms rather than nominal. However, the use of returns constrains us
to use a monthly observation interval which may decrease the accuracy of the
parameter estimates.
Treasury bill and. common stock returns, deflated by the CPI, were obtained

from the Ibbotson and Sinquefield bond file over the period 1926 to 1983, a total

of 696 observations. Estimation of equation (4) for real bill returns yielded

returns having higher serial correlation (b2 =

between stocks and bills is smaller. Also, using a longer period (1926—83), we
find that the standard deviations of real stock and bill returns, .207 end

.018,

respectively, are larger than the corresponding nominal stock and bill return
standard deviation estimates over the 1978—83 period, .157 and .010.

Tables 6 and 7 give the optimal stock portfolio weight, (t),

for

Model 1

and Model 2, respectively. The estimates in both of the Tables are quite
similar. The larger estimated variance of stocks seems to have the effect of
reducing the optimal portfolio weights compared to those estimated in Tables 2

and 5. However, there continues to be very little difference between the
continuous revision portfolios for the non—serial correlation case, w(0), and the

serial correlation case, (o). Also as in previous estimates, there is not
generally monotonic anti—diversification as the revision period increases, though
there continues to be little difference in optimal portfolio weights even out to
a 10 year revision interval.

27

IV. Conclusions
The notion that portfolio behavior might depend on the length of time
for which the portfolio is held is highly intuitive. Goldman (1979) showed
that the relevant period is not the investor's horizon, but rather the
portfolio revision period, the length of time for which the portfolio cannot

be revised. Assuming serially uncorrelated asset returns Goldman proved an
anti—diversification result, in which the portfolio becomes less diversified

—

as the portfolio revision period increases.
When asset returns are serially correlated, the relative riskiness of
assets is typically a function of the length of time for which they are held.
We show in this paper how changes in the relative riskiness of assets
interact with changes in the portfolio revision period to affect portfolios.

The Goldman anti—diversification result no longer necessarily holds. Nor is
the change in the portfolio any longer necessarily a monotonic function of
the length of the portfolio revision period.

We estimated dynamic processes for bill and stock returns, and used them
to

calculate optimal portfolios as a

period.

function of the portfolio revision

The most striking result was how little the portfolio proportions

changed as the period lengthened. We did find

in cases where the Goldman

anti—diversification tendency conflicted with changing relative variances of
asset returns, that the changing relative variances were asymptotically
dominant.

Because the serial correlation of asset returns was estimated to be
relatively low, there was very little difference between portfolios estimated

with and without hedging demands. If our estimated processes are reasonably
accurate, hedging demands and the errors made in assuming a one—period rather
than multi—period CAPN are

small.

28

It remains entirely possible that individual assets, like land and

particular

stocks, could display considerable serial correlation of returns

despite the absence of significant serial correlation of asset returns at the
aggregate level.
