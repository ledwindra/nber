The New Lifecycle of Women’s Employment: Disappearing Humps, Sagging Middles,
Expanding Tops
Claudia Goldin and Joshua Mitchell
NBER Working Paper No. 22913
December 2016
JEL No. J16,J21
ABSTRACT
A new lifecycle of women’s employment emerged with cohorts born in the 1950s. For prior
cohorts, lifecycle employment had a hump shape; it increased from the twenties to the forties, hit
a peak and then declined starting in the fifties. The new lifecycle of employment is initially high
and flat, there is a dip in the middle and a phasing out that is more prolonged than for previous
cohorts. The hump is gone, the middle is a bit sagging and the top has greatly expanded. We
explore the increase in cumulative work experience for women from the 1930s to the 1970s birth
cohorts using the SIPP and the HRS. We investigate the changing labor force impact of a birth
event across cohorts and by education and also the impact of taking leave or quitting. We find
greatly increased labor force experience across cohorts, far less time out after a birth and greater
labor force recovery for those who take paid or unpaid leave. Increased employment of women
in their older ages is related to more continuous work experience across the lifecycle.

For US women born before the 1950s, labor force participation over the life cycle
followed a distinct inverted-U shape—or what could be termed a “hump.” Specifically, labor
force involvement for birth cohorts of women before the 1950s rose steeply from the time
the women were in their 20s to when they were in their late 40s. Participation rates then
decreased after women reached their early 50s. However, the hump has now disappeared.
A new life cycle of women’s labor force participation has emerged. For cohorts born
since the mid-1950s, the female labor force participation rate is high during the decade or
so after schooling ends. Labor force participation rates then decrease somewhat when
women are in their 30s and early 40s, a feature we term the “sagging middle.”
Participation then increases a bit, before phasing out as cohorts move into their 60s and
beyond. We cannot yet observe more recent cohorts in their older years, but for earlier
cohorts, labor force participation has greatly expanded for women in their 60s and 70s
relative to previous cohorts. Thus, it seems plausible that later stages of the life cycle will
involve a more prolonged phasing out of work—an expanding top relative to the past. The
full new life cycle of women’s labor force participation now looks relatively high and fairly
flat, vaguely like that of men’s but with a somewhat lower level and squishier middle.
The combination of the sagging middle and expanding top has produced a “twist” in
the labor force rates of cohorts at the start, middle, and completion of their working lives.
What we mean by a twist is that historically, more recent cohorts have had the highest
participation rates at each age and earlier cohorts the lowest. It remains true that for
women in their 20s and 30s, the most recent cohorts have the highest labor force
participation levels, followed by the earlier cohorts, and so on in almost perfect
chronological order. A similar pattern is found for women older than around 55 years: that
is, the most recent cohorts that can be followed to those ages also have the highest levels of
labor force participation and the earlier cohorts have lower levels in strict year of birth
order. But in the middle years, the most recent cohorts of women have somewhat lower
participation force participation than some of the earlier ones. Thus, there has been a twist
in the ordering.

Our description of changes in labor force participation relies on three customary
effects: period (year), cohort (year of birth), and life cycle (age). These three effects are
linearly related (for example, the current year = year of birth + age). Yet despite the
inherent difficulty for researchers in identifying their separate influences, there are
reasons to believe that different forces affect each. Period effects influence all individuals in
a year, independent of their age. Wars or recessions, for example, could lead individuals at
all ages to increase or decrease their desired labor supply during a given period. Cohort
effects determine the intercept of a life-cycle path, in effect shifting life-cycle labor force
participation of a cohort up or down. Each cohort can have a similarly shaped labor force
path but be above (or below) the others. The lifecycle effect determines the shape of the
function by age and can be altered by changes in the age at marriage and at first birth,
among other factors. We will assume in this discussion that period or year effects are
negligible, and that cohort and life-cycle effects dominate.
Both the sagging middle and the expanding top have attracted attention. The
observations of a sagging middle led, around a decade ago, to a disparagement that young
women were “opting out.” The expanding top has recently led some to comment
optimistically that older women are working in greater numbers than before because they
are healthier and find greater enjoyment in their jobs. Others, expressing some pessimism,
have noted that many women have insufficient financial resources to enjoy their older
years and end their employment (for discussion, see the papers in Goldin and Katz
forthcoming).
The changes in employment in the middle and the top of the age range may appear
to be opposing trends. We will argue that they are not. The sagging middle emerged
because the increases in the cohort effect have decelerated and have been trivial recently.
Instead, we are now seeing the life-cycle or aging effect almost entirely. The life-cycle effect,
moreover, changed with the 1950s and 1960s birth cohorts. Those cohorts of women
began to marry later and have their children at older ages than did previous cohorts (on
the role of the pill see Bailey 2010 and Goldin and Katz 2002). Most of their members
participated in the labor force early on and delayed childbearing. Some withdrew for a

-2-

while in their middle years and later returned. A large fraction will (most probably) have a
less steep decline in employment in their later years than did previous cohorts. But since
none of the more recent cohorts has yet to reach the older years, the later chapters of their
life-cycle story have yet to be written.
The female population has been distinctly heterogeneous in its labor supply for
some time (Goldin 1989; Heckman and Willis 1977). Labor supply heterogeneity means
that women who are in the labor force remain in for a long time, while those who are out of
the labor force enter as the cohort rate increases. As they enter, they, too, remain in. That is,
heterogeneity in this case is based on the observation that there is considerable persistence
among those currently in the labor force. In contrast, a homogeneous labor force would
mean that all women work an equal fraction of the year, sometimes low and sometimes
high. Persistence has implications for the role of employment early in life for that later and
it also implies consequences for lengthy spells out of the labor force to care for children
and others. We first explore the general labor force trends and then examine the
heterogeneity of the population as the earlier life-cycle of women’s employment has
morphed into the new.
We first map out the general trends using synthetic, rather than actual longitudinal,
cohorts that we have created based on data from the Current Population Survey (CPS). We
then move to using true longitudinal data from the Survey of Income and Program
Participation (SIPP) and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), both linked to the Social
Security Administration (SSA) earnings data (from 1957 for the SIPP and from 1951 for the
HRS) and income tax (W-2) records (from 1978 for the SIPP and 1980 for the HRS). We
estimate the distribution of years for women in the labor force and examine the
heterogeneity of female labor force participants. We then turn to the changing impact of
births on employment using an event study analysis and also consider the role of leave
policy. We end with a discussion of the reasons why these changes have occurred and the
future of US female employment.
Our bottom line is that the US female labor force has greatly expanded and evolved,
but that birth events that had always produced a temporary retreat from employment are
-3-

now occurring later with the delay in marriage and childbirth. They are, moreover, more
apparent because of the increase in employment at younger ages. The increased
employment of women in their older years appears to be a continuing trend but only time
will tell.

The Evolving Life Cycle of Women’s Employment
A “synthetic” birth cohort links age groups over time for a given cohort: for example,
those who were born from 1935-40 will all be between ages 25-30 in 1965, and between
ages 30-35 in 1970, and so on. In this way, one can track the experiences of the group over
time without having data on specific individuals. One can condition on time-invariant
variables such as education level, for those beyond school age, and birth place. Synthetic
labor force participation rates for different cohorts can be created by linking data by birth
cohort using the annual figures from the Current Population Survey March surveys (which
is also known as the CPS Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC)). We do this for
all women and also by education level for college graduates and all others. We use nativeborn only women when those data begin in 1994.1
Our focus is on nine cohorts born during five-year intervals from 1930 to 1974, for
consistency with our later discussion of longitudinal administrative and survey data from
the Survey of Income and Program Participation and the Health and Retirement Study. We
begin the analysis with age 25 to avoid confusing increases in higher education with
decreases in labor force participation. Because the CPS micro-data starts with 1962, we
cannot include information for some of the early cohorts in their younger years.
Figure 1A shows the results of this synthetic cohort labor force data for women born
from 1930 to 1974. Labor force participation rates for women have generally increased
with each cohort, as shown by increases in the intercept. Within cohorts, participation has
often increased for a time, before declining. However, labor force participation has not
The reason to use native-born only is because the foreign born could enter at any age. In addition,
our later use of the HRS and SIPP requires using the native-born since we use longitudinal
information from Social Security records. See the online Appendix available with this paper at
http://e-jep.org for figures that include all women regardless of birthplace.

uniformly increased for each subsequent cohort and has also not necessarily increased
within each cohort, among the most recent cohorts. The most recent cohorts have the
highest participation rates in their mid- to late-20s (their lines are the highest at the upper
left of the figure), but they no longer do when in their middle years. For the cohorts we can
observe in their older years the ordering returns to one that is more strictly chronological.
These features have produced the sagging middle of lower labor force participation rates
among women those in their 30 and 40s, along with a twist in terms of the ordering of the
cohorts.
Figure 1B shows labor force participation rates by cohort for college graduate
women and Figure 1C gives detail on the five most recent college graduate cohorts born in
five-year intervals from1950 to 1974. The fraction of women born in the 1980s who will be
college graduates by the time they are 35 years old is today almost 45 percent. 2 Therefore,
the new life-cycle labor force participation of women is tending to look more like the five
cohorts in Figure 1C—beginning high, dipping down a bit in the mid-30s and then
increasing again. Because the earlier cohorts among these five did not start out as high and
did not dip as much as the most recent ones, the cohort lines are no longer one on top of
each other in strict chronological procession. Rather, the arrangement of the lines
distinctly twists. The order begins chronological with the latest cohort on top. But by the
early 40s it reverses with earlier cohorts having the highest participation and the more
recent ones the lowest. It is still too early to know whether the ordering will once again
return to the strict chronology, but from the slopes of the lines, it looks like it will.
In this new lifecycle, for all education groups, the hump-shape of labor force
participation apparent for older cohorts of women largely disappears. Instead,
participation rates for the average woman do not change much until older ages with the
phasing out of employment. One way to think about these changes is that the cohort effect
has become swamped by the life-cycle effect. For earlier cohorts, each line is above its
predecessor, but with much the same shape. However, participation rates for recent
The fraction is about 40 percent for native-born women from the 1980 cohort who were 35 years
old and extrapolations suggest that 44 percent will graduate by 35 years old for the 1987 cohort.

cohorts (1950s onwards) in their 20s are high and do not vary much. With a diminished
cohort effect, the life-cycle effect of decreased participation in child-rearing years has
become more apparent. Because the child rearing years are now later, a sagging middle
has resulted. We will show the effects of child-rearing and persistence in the labor force in
the next section, using true longitudinal information by mothers’ cohort.

Longitudinal Data
Aggregate synthetic cohort data can demonstrate, as we just did, the evolution of a
new life cycle of women’s employment. But these data cannot reveal the degree to which
specific women persisted in the labor force and whether those in the labor force earlier in
their lives remained in with a greater likelihood. The synthetic cohort data cannot show
how women’s employment has changed by cohort over time in response to important life
cycle events, such as births. Moreover, synthetic cohort data do not allow us to distinguish
among women within a cohort to see the fractions of their post-schooling lives that are
spent in the labor force and how that distribution changed within and across cohorts.
To make better sense of the evolution of the new life cycle of work we turn to
longitudinal data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation and the Health and
Retirement Study, both linked to the Social Security Administration earnings records and
W-2 forms. The linkage to the SSA records provides extensive longitudinal information on
the earnings of large numbers of individuals across cohorts born from the early 1930s to
the mid-1970s. This section describes our longitudinal data; the next section describes the
labor force patterns based on the data.
These two longitudinal data sets offer rich and complementary information. Because
they are each complicated in their construction, we will summarize only those aspects
pertinent to this article.3 The Health and Retirement Study began in 1992 with 51 to 61
year-olds who were then interviewed biennially. Additional cohorts were added in 1998,
2004 and 2010 for respondents who were then 51 to 56 years old. Together with the

spouses of the respondents who became age-eligible at some later date, these are the main
birth cohorts we use from the HRS. They span birth years from 1931 to 1959. Respondents
were given the option of having their Social Security earnings records linked to their HRS
surveys. Because this was done during each interview, the earlier cohorts have a higher
fraction linked. Linkage rates are 80 percent on average and about 88 percent for those
born before 1943.
The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) was begun in 1984 with
new panels added in 1996, 2001, 2004 and 2008. Each panel begins with individuals who
are between 30 and 60 years old and are interviewed for four consecutive years. We use
the Gold Standard File, which is a harmonized set of SIPP panels linked to longitudinal
earnings records.4 Our analysis uses SIPP panels 1996, 2001, 2004, and 2008 and
integrates information from the fertility history topical modules. Our overall sample begins
with women who range from around 30 to 60 years old at the time of their fertility history
interview.
Our primary interest is in the work history information. Each of the two datasets has
a survey component and an administrative portion from the Social Security Administration
earnings records. Although the administrative component is identical, the data sets differ in
their coverage of retrospective information that bears on the work history. For example,
the Health and Retirement Study provides retrospective information on the respondent’s
longest occupation and also the years when the individual worked for a government agency
for upwards of two periods. The Survey of Income and Program Participation contains
information that bears on whether the woman took job protected or paid leave after having
a birth, whether she returned to the same employer after that leave, and whether she quit
her current job around the time of the birth event. Both the HRS and the SIPP contain
variables that are (reasonably) time invariant (for example, the level of education for those
beyond age 35; children ever born by age 40) and both have time-variant longitudinal
information for the duration of the surveys.

Data from the SIPP Gold Standard File are confidential. All results have been formally reviewed to
ensure that no confidential Census Bureau data have been disclosed.

The work history information from the Social Security Administration earnings
records, W-2 forms and the survey data provide annual labor earnings, but not labor force
participation, or hours and weeks of work, except for the survey years. We generate an
estimate of labor force “participation” for the years we have the SSA and W-2 records by
assuming that individuals are labor force participants if they earned more than some
minimum amount—equivalent to 10 hours a week for 52 weeks at the federal minimum
wage—in that year. Our estimated participation rates are nearly identical to those from
the CPS-ASEC for the overlapping years.5
We cobble together our data on cohort labor force participation by using each of our
longitudinal data sets when it seems the most complete. For example, some occupations
such as most teachers and other government employees were exempt from Social Security
tax and would not have earnings reported in the SSA data even when they were employed.
But they can be included after 1977 when W-2 data are available for the Survey of Income
and Program Participation and after 1979 for the Health and Retirement Study. These
workers can also be folded in for the HRS in the years the respondent listed retrospective
information on government employment. Our choice of whether to use the SIPP-SSA or the
HRS-SSA data is a function of the birth cohort and the age of the individual. Because we
employ ten-year age intervals, our decision depends on the youngest age in the interval.
The exempt worker issue is far less of a problem for the non-college graduate group since
they would not have been teachers and are less likely to have been government employees
in general. The SIPP and HRS longitudinal labor force data that we generate from the SSA
records closely match each other for overlapping birth cohorts, so any measurement error
introduced by comparisons between the two longitudinal datasets should be modest.

For details of the comparison between our estimate and the Current Population Survey estimate,
see the Appendix available with this paper at http://e-jep.org. The CPS labor force estimate comes
from a question about whether the individual was working for pay or profit during at least one hour
in the survey week or was actively searching for work. The Social Security administration data are
annual and there is no obvious amount of annual income that would be equivalent to the CPS labor
force question. Because most labor force respondents are working a reasonable number of hours
during a survey week, we chose our definition of ten hours at the minimum wage.

Evidence on New and Old Lifecycles from Administrative Data
Labor Force Experience
Our longitudinal data from a combination of these datasets allow us to estimate
labor market experience for women born from 1935 to 1974 by age and by education. The
aggregate data are given in Figure 2 for three groups—all women, college graduates, and
non-college graduates. The data are shown for the full 25 to 54 year-old group, then for the
youngest group 25 to 34 years old, and finally for all women in three ten-year age groups
using more high frequency birth cohorts. Only longitudinal data can be used to construct work
experience; for example, the Current Population Survey did not ask respondents how long they
had been employed.6
The entire 25-54 year-old group, shown in Figure 2A, can be observed for (nativeborn) birth cohorts up to 1959. For those cohorts, mean years of work experience in that
30-year interval increased from 16.4 to 22.2. For the most recent of the cohorts in our data
(1955-59), the average woman was employed for 74 percent of the 30-year period. For
college graduates in the most recent cohorts, the figure is 82 percent. Much of the total
increase in mean years of work experience occurred in the youngest of the age groups (2534). Figure 2B shows cumulative experience within the 25-34 year group for birth cohorts
from 1935 to 1974.
The increase for the youngest age group was large: slightly more than half of the
total increase from 25 to 54 years old among women born from 1935 to 1959 (3.05 of the
total of 5.9 years) occurred in the 25-34 year group. But most of it occurred for cohorts
born before 1959. The increase for the 25-34 year-old group from the 1955-59 to the 197074 birth cohorts was less than an additional year.
For the 25-34 year-old group average work experience in that interval reached
around 8.7 years for college graduates and around 7.3 years for the non-college group. The
In another study using a different source of longitudinal data, Attanasio, Low and Sanche -Marcos
(2008) use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and analyze the different lifecycle
employment among three cohorts of women, those born at the end of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s.

change from the 1935 to the 1974 birth cohorts for all women, it should be noted, was
almost 4 years, a bit greater than for the two separate educational components—the
college and non-college groups—because of a relative increase in the college graduate
group. But the main findings are not much different for each group separately.
Figure 2.C puts the three ten-year age groups together in one graph. Total
cumulative experience for the 25 to 34-year old group doubled from around 3.9 years for
the late 1930s cohorts to 7.85 years for the early 1970s cohorts. The other two ten-year age
groups show sturdy increases until around the early 1950s cohorts. Looking at the cohorts
born around 1965 reveals that the fraction of 25-34 year old women in the labor force
began to exceed that for the 35-44 year old group (both being around 7.5 years out of the
10). Previously the older group’s fraction had exceeded the younger for all previous
cohorts. Delay of childbirth, we will soon suggest, led to increased participation for the
youngest group but also caused slower increases for the middle group—yet another way of
understanding the appearance of a sagging middle.
Distribution of Work Years
Work experience clearly increased for women across birth cohorts from the 1930s
to the 1970s. But the aggregate numbers do not reveal the distribution of work years: for
example, a 60 percent labor force participation rate could mean that all women work 60
percent of the time or that 40 percent are never at work and 60 percent work full-time. The
former scenario is termed “homogeneous” (since all women are the same) and the latter
“heterogeneous” (since women in that scenario greatly differ). Most estimates have found
considerably more heterogeneity than homogeneity and our data will reveal the same. But
as labor force participation rates rise, there is less room for heterogeneity.
To explore heterogeneity among labor force participants we compute the
distribution of years in the labor force for each birth cohort by age interval. As summary
statistics we provide the fractions at the two tails of the distribution: the fraction working
more than 80 percent of the period and the fraction working less than 20 percent.

-10-

For the most recent cohorts that can be observed across the full 30-year period from
age 25-54—that is, those born in 1957-58 in our data—53.3 percent of women were
employed for more than 80 percent of the 30-year period and just 9 percent were
employed for less than 20 percent, as shown in the right-hand tails of the lines in Figure 3A.
For the earlier cohorts, born in the 1930s, the distribution of employment across the life
cycle is far different. It is almost uniform, with around 20 percent employed less than 20
percent of the entire period and 20 percent employed for more than 80 percent. Indeed,
about 20 percent of the 1930s cohort is employed in each of the quintiles. Because labor force
participation for these early cohorts was only around 30 percent for the 25 to 29-year group and
then rose to around 60 percent as the cohorts aged, for those 50 to 54 years old, the findings on
the distribution of life-cycle employment for this cohort are more consistent with a
heterogeneous model of participation rather than a homogeneous one.
Figure 3B presents the same evidence, but for the 25-34 year-old group and thus for
more recent cohorts. For the most recent cohorts shown greater than 60 percent are
employed more than 80 percent of the ten years, whereas only about 16 percent had been
for the earliest cohorts shown, those born in the 1930s.
There has been considerable persistence in participation among women: that is,
those who work more when young also continue in the labor force when older. We have
examined the labor force participation of those who worked a considerable amount—more
than 60 percent—of the period they were 25 to 34 years old. Among women who worked
more than 60 percent of those years, 76 percent in the 1950s birth cohorts worked more
than 80 percent from 35 to 44 and 76 percent did from 45 to 54 years old. Conversely, just
32 percent of those who worked no more than five years of the 25 to 34 year old period
were employed more than 80 percent of the next decade and 50 percent of the following
one.
There are important implications of increased lifecycle employment for continued
work later in life. In related work, Goldin and Katz (2016) find that greater employment
early in one’s life is strongly related to employment at the later ages (they examine
participation at ages 59 to 63), given education and birth cohort. Thus, the increase in life-11-

cycle employment for those 25-54 implies delayed retirement. But even though the college
educated would appear to have hit a plateau in their lifecycle employment around the 1950
cohort, Goldin and Katz (2016) caution that other factors have led to the increased
employment of college graduate women at older years and will probably do the same for
the more recent cohorts.
What about the role of delayed childbirth for the most recent cohorts? We find using
the Health and Retirement Study that an increase in the age at which the first child is born,
say from 25 years to 30 years, is correlated with increased participation in the 25 to 34year interval but decreased participation in the 35 to 44-year interval, even holding the
number of children born constant.7 This finding implies that a later age at first birth is an
important factor in the twist in life-cycle labor force participation. It is still the case,
however, that later births mean greater participation for the entire 25 to 44-year period
probably because substantial human capital investments are made early on. We turn now
to an analysis of the role of childbirth and labor force participation across cohorts.

Childbirth and Life-cycle Participation
The changed timing and number of children are important parts of the transition to
the new life cycle of women’s employment. Not only are children in more recent cohorts
being born to older mothers but also there are fewer children in these families than in the
earlier cohorts. The previous norm was one in which women had their children when
young, then left the labor force and reentered employment somewhat later. In the current
era women have their children when older, have greater attachment to the labor force, take
less time off and later reestablish their employment and careers faster. The one possible
exception, we will see, is college graduate women in the most recent cohorts we can track.
Their participation rates at first birth are very high but do not return to those levels a
decade after the first birth.

The regressions are estimated for the fraction of the 25-34 year and 35-44 year intervals in the
labor force across birth cohorts from 1931 to 1954 for women with at least one birth. Cohort,
number of children, education and race dummies are included. Age of the mother at the first birth is
entered as a quadratic.

Both the Survey of Income and Program Participation and the Health and
Retirement Study contain information on the year of birth for the first child and the
number of subsequent births. We use the data to create event studies for all women who
had a first birth. The event study evidence is given in Figure 4A for all women and
separately in Figure 4B for those with a four-year college degree. We use the HRS for the
1935 to 1949 birth cohorts and the SIPP for the 1950 to 1969 birth cohorts for reasons
mentioned earlier (specifically, the HRS is better at identifying workers exempt from Social
Security in the pre-1978 period).
Looking first at all women in Figure 4A, the cohorts born from 1935 to 1944 had
initial participation rates a bit higher than 0.5 before the first birth. These rates plummet to
around 0.24 to 0.28 just after the birth and never recover to pre-birth levels in the ten
subsequent years. These are “baby boom” mothers, for whom the number of children
(conditional on having one) is 3.26 for the 1935-1939 cohort and 2.85 for the 1940-1944
cohort (using the CPS June Fertility Supplements micro-data for women 40 years and
older).8 A more detailed look at the data shows that even for women with just one or two
births until they are in their 40s, labor force participation rates never reach pre-birth levels
in the next ten years. Mothers in the 1935-44 birth cohorts retreated from the labor force
for some time. But since births are staggered and pre-birth participation rates for these
cohorts were low, the increase in participation across the life cycle as women aged
produced the hump shape seen in Figure 1.
Labor force recovery for the 1945-49 cohorts, unlike their predecessors, is complete
by ten years after the first birth even though the initial participation rates are much higher.
Participation rates for the cohorts born from 1950-54 to the early 1960s begin around 0.6
to 0.7 and for those that can be observed ten years out, rates equal or exceed those before

In the online Appendix available with this paper at http://e-jep.org, Appendix Table 1 contains the
mean age at first birth to ever-moms, the numbers of children eventually born to ever-moms and
the fraction of the group with zero births in the Health and Retirement Study and Survey of Income
and Program Participation. Appendix Table 1 also has the numbers of children for ever-moms and
fraction of the group with zero births from the much larger CPS June Fertility Supplements microdata. Data are provided for all and college graduate women (native-born in the more recent cohorts
due to availability in the CPS).

the birth. The number of eventual births was 2.48 in the 1945-49 cohort and 2.29 for the
1955-59 cohort.9
The data for the college group shown in Figure 4B are similar but noisier, due to the
smaller number of observations. The levels are considerably higher than for the total group
that include all education levels. As with the total group, there is a sharp break with the
1945-49 cohort. Whereas participation rates of previous cohorts did not fully recover, the
1945-49 and 1950-54 cohorts did so after ten years. Subsequent cohorts, however, have
pre-birth labor force rates around 0.83 to 0.88, and those that we can observe ten years
after the birth do not fully recover. In fact, the rates for the 1960-64 cohorts are lower than
for the 1955-59 cohorts. These facts are consistent with the crossing of the synthetic cohort
participation lines for college graduates born from 1955-59 and 1960-64, shown earlier in
Figures 1B and 1C.
One may have wondered why there is an increase in participation just before the
birth. Because some births occur while the mother is still in school or several years after
school completion, labor force participation often increases in the three years preceding
the first birth in both Figure 4 graphs. When we focus only on first births occurring after
age 24, labor force participation no longer increases in the pre-birth years.
The effect of children on the employment of women in their 20s and early 30s has
consequences for later employment. Thus, the decrease in years out of the labor force by
mothers in more recent cohorts, as seen in Figures 4A, is predictive of greater employment
later in their lives.
The modules in the Survey of Income and Program Participation contain

See online Appendix 1. These means are conditional on having at least one birth and use the CPS
June Fertility Supplement micro-data for women
years and older. Similar indings are given in
Attanasio, ow and Sanche -Marcos (2008, figure 7) although they present data on employment
only 12 months before and 12 months after the birth. See also Angelov, Johansson and Lindahl
(2016) on Sweden and Kleven, Landais, and Søgaard (2016) on Denmark for birth event analyses
that track labor force participation, hours and earnings for at least ten years after the birth. Kleven
et al. find substantial and persistent decreases in labor force participation that are greater than
those we estimate for all US women, showing that the motherhood penalty is substantial even in
nations with generous leave policy.

information on the use of paid and unpaid leave during the year a woman’s first child is
born, as well as whether the woman quit her current job in that interval. Rather than
presenting the information by mother’s birth cohort, as we did for the labor force data, a
more meaningful arrangement is by the birth year of the first child. All the women in our
analysis sample had a birth in one of three periods—1980-1989, 1990-1999 and 20002007—and all reported employment in the SIPP at some point in their pregnancy.10
Because we begin with 1980s births, the mothers are part of cohorts born since 1955 and
are, therefore, part of the group of women exhibiting the new life cycle of work.
The fraction of women who reported that they quit their jobs around the time of the
birth decreased from 28 percent for those having their first child in the 1980s to 19 percent
in the early 2000s.11 The fraction taking paid leave increased from 34 percent in the 1880s
to 42 percent in the 2000s and the fraction on unpaid leave stayed fairly constant at around
30 percent (29 percent in the 1980s and 31 percent in the 2000s), where paid and unpaid
leave include sick, vacation, disability, maternity and other. About 8 percent in each of the
three periods made no declaration of any type of leave or quit. Therefore, the fractions in
each of the categories changed, with leaves increasing and quits decreasing by almost 20
percentage points for the entire group.
We estimate the labor force participation of first-time mothers depending upon
their leave or quit status during the pregnancy and at birth and track their post-birth
participation for ten years and their pre-birth participation for three years. Recall that the
sample is defined in terms of mothers who reported in the SIPP that they worked at some
point during pregnancy but that we estimate labor force participation in each calendar year
as having administrative earnings above a minimum threshold. Because the participation
rates are derived from annual earnings data, we cannot precisely identify the moment of

We begin the analysis with the 1980s to get around the problem that exempt workers pose for
the SIPP data, mentioned earlier in the text.
11 About one-quarter of the respondents gave multiple leave types (e.g., paid and unpaid leave) and
we proportionately allocate leaves for each birth. Changes regarding leave type in the SIPP are
greater if we extend the analysis to births in the 1960s and 1970s. But the earlier data are not fully
consistent with later data and the exemption issue, discussed before, would affect many
government workers in the earlier cohorts. HRS data cannot be used instead.

the pregnancy and only know the year of the birth. If the birth was early in the year, the
pregnancy would have mainly been in the previous year and the woman could be
considered out of the labor force the year of the birth. But if the birth was late in the year,
the woman could be deemed in the labor force that year. Since many mothers have low
annual incomes due to unpaid leaves or quits and because the leaves can be staggered for
the group, the aggregate rates shown in Figure 5 for the year before the birth are less than
100 percent. For the group that eventually quit, they are considerably lower.
Interestingly, during the 33-year period observed (1980 to 2012) and conditional
on leave type, new mothers did not change their behavior much in terms of employment
after their first birth. Because the results for all years given leave type are similar we show
the data in Figure 5 only for women who were new mothers in the 1990s.
Those on paid leave have the highest employment rates before, during and after
pregnancy, followed by those on unpaid leave. The lowest rates are for those who quit
during the pregnancy although ten years after the first birth their participation rate is 64
percent. Those on paid leave have a participation rate of 82 percent after ten years,
considerably higher. Without an analysis of what determines who falls in each of these
different categories it is impossible to infer the impact that paid-leave, or longer protectedleave, policies would have on women’s employment. But taking leave and staving off quits
would appear to increase participation after a birth.12

Some International Comparisons
Current labor market participation rates of US women are low compared with those
of other OECD nations. Moreover, the US rank in terms of these rates has deteriorated in
the last 25 years. For women in the 25-54 year-old group among 21 OECD countries, the
Olivetti and Petrongolo, in their paper in this issue, have an extensive discussion of the family
leave literature. Their own empirical work shows that guaranteed and paid leave will increase
women’s employment to a point, but can reduce it for extensive leave policies. Only a few US states
have paid leave, and protected leave is generally limited to that covered by the Family and Medical
Leave Act of 1993. Rossin-Slater, Ruhm and Waldfogel (2013) find that California’s paid leave policy
(which took effect in 2004) expanded leave use and had no negative employment effects and
possibly positive ones.
12

-16-

United States ranked sixth highest in 1990, ninth in 2000, and seventeenth in 2014. The US
does much better when full-time rates are considered, because part-time work is more
common in other OECD countries, particularly for women. Using the OECD common
definition of full-time employment (30 hours per week in the usual job), the US was fourth
(out of 18) in 1990, fifth (out of 20) in 2000, and eighth in 2014.13 The topic of hours of
work—the intensive margin—is a large and separate issue that we do not address here.
Paid and protected leaves—by definition—imply higher labor force participation
rates because, in most data, individuals on leave are counted in the labor force. That factor
can account for 4 to 4.5 percentage points (for the 25-54-year-old group) of the higher
labor force participation among women 25 to 54 years old in Austria, Denmark, Norway
and Sweden, which are nations with very generous leave policies relative to the United
States, the least generous. The actual differences in labor force participation between
women 25 to 54 years old in the United States and in these countries are 10 to 14
percentage points in 2014. That is, measurement can explain around 30 to 40 percent of
the difference. Among women in their 30s, the entire difference in participation rates
between the US and Denmark, Norway and Sweden can be attributed to how women on
leave are counted. But leave policy could have more than a definitional impact.
The roles played by public and private leave policies in accounting for these crossnational differences are complicated. Blau and Kahn (2013) find a positive relationship
between leave policies and labor force participation, but also emphasize that the low-hours
jobs women often have in these nations generally preclude careers. The fundamental
question is whether new mothers who want to spend more weeks at home than allowed
end up quitting their job and then have difficulty finding another position. When mandated
parental leaves are greatly extended another issue is whether firms reduce demand for
women in the age bracket who might be more likely to use long protected leaves (as
discussed in the paper by Olivetti and Petrongolo in this issue).

The 21 countries are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,
Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxemburg, Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand,
Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the US. The full-time measure is not always available.

Comparisons between the lifecycle employment patterns presented in this article
with those for other OECD nations reveal that extensive protected and paid leave is
probably not the main reason for the differences and thus not the primary reason for the
slow recovery time in the birth event analysis. Lifecycle participation graphs for the United
Kingdom look like those for the United States, despite its longer protected and paid leave.
But lifecycle employment patterns for France and Denmark, for example, have continued to
increase with age. The lower cost and higher quality of childcare is probably the main
factor (a conclusion arrived at by Olivetti and Petrongolo in their paper in this issue).

Conclusions
A new life cycle of women’s labor force participation emerged with cohorts born in
the 1950s. It is flatter and higher with no hump, but with a dip in the middle and a phasing
out that is later than for previous cohorts. High levels of female employment early in life
are predictive of working longer at older ages, although no cohorts with the new lifecycle
characteristics are yet old enough to observe in their 60s and 70s.
What brought about the new lifecycle of women’s work? The most important part
of the story is the increase in participation by a succession of cohorts. That tale begins in
the early twentieth century and is mainly about the impact of the growth in real wages
combined with an increased importance of the substitution effect and a declining
importance of the income effect (Blau and Kahn 2007). Later, young women in the late
1960s and 1970s began to have more realistic expectations of their future employment and
started to make educational investments that could lead to longer and fulfilling careers
(Goldin 2

6). The “quiet revolution” that resulted further expanded women’s

employment. Together with the improved ability of young women to control the timing of
childbirth (with the “pill”), the marriage age rose, and births were delayed. Motherhood
came later in life and its impact on employment and careers was lessened.
More recent trends do not seem to have led to a great backpedaling in female
employment. The scare about women’s “opting out” of the workforce in the early 2

s

was a misinterpretation of the changes in the lifecycle of work. The sagging middle has
-18-

been the result of a greater employment of women in their 20s together with a delay of
childbirth and a negative (but smaller) employment impact of motherhood. The negative
impact of motherhood is often attributed to the short-term nature of (federally) protected
parental leave in the United States. Yet this explanation can only be a partial one. Many
college graduates who have paid leave or more weeks of protected leave than the 12 weeks
guaranteed to many workers by the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), have
employment that also discloses a sagging middle.
Yet, relative to several other rich nations, women in the United States have been
working a lower fraction of their lives when 25-54 years old. These other nations have had
continued cohort effects and it is unclear whether this is due to leave policy, child care
provision or hours differences. On the plus side, however, is that US women remain in the
labor force longer, what we term the expanding top.
An implication of the new life cycle of labor force participation for women is that
cohorts entering their older years have more work experience, often have satisfying
careers rather than just jobs, have invested more in their vocations, have more of their
identity bound up in their work. and have more steeply sloped earnings trajectories. It is no
wonder that employment has greatly increased at older ages and these underlying
dynamics give reason to believe that it will continue to do so.

Sources and Notes: Labor force experience for an age group and birth cohort (only native-born)
is computed from our estimates of participation rates (see Appendix) from the HRS-SSA and
SIPP-SSA. We use HRS-SSA data for 25 to 34 year olds for birth cohorts from 1935 to 1954 and
for those 35 to 44 years old for the 1935 to 1944 birth cohorts. For all other cohorts we use the
data from the SIPP-SSA. To compute the totals for the 25 to 54 year span we sum the separate
ten-year age groups independent of the source. In all cases, we use native-born women only. The
data for overlapping cohorts between the HRS-SSA and SIPP-SSA are generally very close. Our
reason for using the HRS-SSA rather than the SIPP-SSA concerns the issue of exempt workers.

Sources and Notes: SIPP-SSA data are for native-born women only. HRS-SSA gives
somewhat higher fractions in the lowest and highest groups in the earlier period. Because
the fraction of college graduate women in these cohorts is not very large, we chose to use a
consistent series for the distribution even though some workers in exempt occupations will
be excluded prior to 1978 using the SIPP.

Appendix on the Health and Retirement Study and the Survey of Income and Program
Participation
1. Health and Retirement Study (HRS)
Both the Health and Retirement Study (known as the HRS) and the Survey of Income
and Program Participation (known as the SIPP) are widely used data sets. Our analyses use
restricted access versions of the data. Information on and public use data for the HRS can
be found at http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/ The U.S. Census Bureau supports external
researchers’ use of the SIPP through the Research Data Center network
www.census.gov/ces and public-use data can be accessed through
www.sipp.census.gov/sipp/ (click “Access SIPP Synthetic Data”). This brief Appendix
discusses certain details of the data relevant to this paper.
The HRS, supported by the National Institute on Aging and the Social Security
Administration, was begun in 1992 with a random sample of households in which at least
one member was born between 1931 and 1941 and thus between 51 and 61 years old. This
initial sample is known as the HRS cohort, is also termed the “Interme o” cohort. In
households containing a married or partnered couple, the “spouse” and “respondent”
categories were randomly assigned to age-eligible individuals. “Spouses” were not given
positive sample weights until 1998, if born from 1931 to 1941. If they were born from 1942
to 19 7, they are not given positive sample weights until the “War Baby” (WB) cohort was
added. The “War Baby” (WB) cohort was born 19 2 to 19 7. The “Early Baby Boomer”
(EBB) cohort, born 1948 to 1953, was added in 2004. The Mid-Boomer (MBB) cohort, 1954
to 1959 was added in 2010. The WB, EBB, and MBB cohorts were between 51 and 56 years
old at the start of the survey.
The cohorts mentioned have been surveyed every two years. Additional cohorts
born before 1931 are also part of the HRS, but the HRS, WB and EBB are the primary ones
we use here. At the time of this writing, the HRS data are available to 2012. Individuals
were asked at each interview if they would agree to have their Social Security earnings
records linked. Therefore the fraction with a linkage increases with the number of
interviews. Among the 1931 to 1942 birth cohort the linkage rate is 89 percent. It is 85
percent for the 1943 to 1945 cohort, 79 percent for the 1946 to 1948 cohort and 71
percent for the 1949 to 1951 group.
2. Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP)
The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) Gold Standard File consists
of a harmonized set of SIPP panels linked to longitudinal earnings records. Our analysis

Appendix -4-

uses SIPP panels 1996, 2001, 2004, and 2008 and integrates information from the fertility
history topical modules conducted in Wave 2 of each panel. We combine basic demographic
information from the Gold Standard File with information from the topical modules on the
number of children, year the first child is born and mothers’ use of leave-taking. The
variables we use from each SIPP survey are cross-sectional, not longitudinal. The panel
dimension of the data comes exclusively from the linked earnings records. Linkage rates
vary by SIPP panel but are typically around 85 percent.
We restrict our overall sample to women approximately 30 to 60 years old when
first interviewed (among those with a valid Social Security number [SSN] assigned). We
estimate a logit regression for each panel using demographic characteristics to predict SSN
assignment and multiply the survey weights by the inverse of the estimated propensity
score. SSN assignment rates vary by panel but are typically around 85 percent.
The Social Security earnings records, to which both HRS and SIPP respondent data
are linked, also contain W-2 forms from 1978. But the HRS was not originally linked to the
full group of W-2 forms. Therefore, we use the W-2 forms for the HRS only after 1980 when
the linkage is complete.
3. Construction of Labor Force Participation Rates Using the HRS-SSA and SIPP-SSA
and Comparisons with the CPS-ASEC
The definition of labor force participation in the CPS-ASEC concerns whether the
individual was working for pay or profit (or actively searching for work) during the census
week. In using both the HRS-SSA and the SIPP-SSA we have annual income data and not a
variable that corresponds to the one in the CPS-ASEC. Both the HRS and SIPP have
contemporaneous questions about labor force participation but that does not exist going
back in time.
Our labor force participation variable treats individuals as being a labor force
participant if they earned (reported as SS or W-2 earnings) at least the equivalent of ten
hours per week at the existing federal minimum wage for 52 weeks per year. The HRS
respondents are included in the labor force if they stated they were “in the labor force”
once the survey began or if they were working for a state, federal or municipal government
in particular years prior to the HRS survey even if they had no SS earnings. Because the
HRS is biennial, we averaged the two years when we used the HRS respondent information
and some, therefore, have the value of 0.5 (the ages for these entries would older than 50
years). All others are non-participants.

Appendix -5-

But how close is that definition to the one in the CPS-ASEC? The answer is that it is
very close. Appendix Figure 1 gives the participation rates for all women estimated from
the HRS for cohorts born from 1931 to 1957. It can be compared with Figure 1 from the
CPS-ASEC. Out of the 36 entries (five-year birth cohorts from 1930 to 1959 and five-year
age groups from 25 to 54), just 14 are not within 5 percentage points (0.95 to 1.05 for the
ratio HRS estimate/CPS-ASEC) and just one is not within 10 percentage points. For the 55
to 59 year old group the estimates are within 10 percentage points. For reasons that are
not yet clear, the HRS overstates participation for those older than 60 years relative to the
CPS. See also Goldin and Katz (2016) for other comparisons of the HRS and the CPS labor
force data.

Sources: HRS for 1935 to 1949 and SIPP (native-born) for 1950 to 1969. Micro-data for the CPS June Fertility Supplements, 1973 to 2014
(annually to 1988 except 1978 and then biennially except for 1995 rather than 1996). Native-born women can be identified consistently
only with the 1994 CPS. The CPS has information on age at first birth only in 2014. See Goldin (2016) for description of the source; see
especially the discussion of possible biases due to a change in the CPS imputation algorithm for missing information concerning births.
Notes: In all cases, number of children ever born is truncated at nine. Completed births are measured at 40 years old and above for the
CPS, at 44 years and above for the SIPP and at 50 years and above for the HRS. The HRS calculations use the first non-zero weight. The CPS
data has between 10,000 and 20,000 observations per five-year birth interval for all women. The SIPP contains about 400 respondents
and the HRS from 1,200 to 2,300 per relevant five-year cohort. The HRS no-birth fractions appear to be too low, but the reason is not clear.
One possibility that that the fraction of women who claim to be college graduates is somewhat overstated for cohorts born before around
1940. The most likely reason is that they were interviewed at older ages and inflated their education level.
