Racial Disparity in COVID-19 Deaths: Seeking Economic Roots with Census data.
John McLaren
NBER Working Paper No. 27407
June 2020
JEL No. I14,J15
ABSTRACT
This note seeks the socioeconomic roots of racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality, using
county-level mortality, economic, and demographic data from 3,140 counties. For all minorities,
the minority's population share is strongly correlated with total COVID-19 deaths. For Hispanic/
Latino and Asian minorities those correlations are fragile, and largely disappear when we control
for education, occupation, and commuting patterns. For African Americans and First Nations
populations, the correlations are very robust. Surprisingly, for these two groups the racial
disparity does not seem to be due to differences in income, poverty rates, education, occupational
mix, or even access to healthcare insurance. A significant portion of the disparity can, however,
be sourced to the use of public transit.

Introduction

The higher mortality rates for African Americans and other minority groups in the COVID19 pandemic has been the subject of much public concern. Centers for Disease Control
(2020) surveys much of what is known about the phenomenon, and Wood (2020) provides
a journalistic survey. Gross et al. (2020) find that the mortality rates for African Americans are more than triple the rates for whites after correcting for age, and the rates for
Hispanic/Latinos are almost double the rates for non-Hispanic whites. The Navajo Nation
has one of the highest mortality rates in the nation.1 The sources of these disparities, however, are more difficult to analyze than establishing the existence of such disparities. If
the disparities can be explained in terms of socioeconomic factors such as income, access
to insurance, and occupation, that knowledge can be useful in designing policies to reduce
the disparities. A number of authors have called for this analysis of sources as an urgent
priority for research. Chowkwanyun and Reed (2020) argue that without an analysis of the
sources, the political discourse can gravitate toward ‘biologic explanations’ or explanations
based on racial stereotypes which are harmful in themselves and get in the way of policy
solutions.2 Wood (2020) summarizes several commentators on the topic, arguing that on
COVID-19 racial disparity, “Outrage is warranted. But outrage unaccompanied by analysis
is a danger in itself.” Timothy Freeman, pastor at Trinity African Methodist Episcopal Zion
Church in Washington, DC, suggested that ‘COVID-19 is affecting black and brown people
in disproportionate numbers, “and not just because we’re black and brown, but because of
the social and economic conditions people are forced to live in...” Johnson (2020).
In this important task of finding the sources of the disparity, a major difficulty is data
limitations. As Gross et al. (2020) report, only 28 state health systems break down their
1
See, for example, Simon Romero and Jack Healy, “Tribal Nations Face Most Severe Crisis in Decades as
the Coronavirus Closes Casinos,” New York Times, May 11, 2020.
2
A recent example of this is the remarks made by Republican Ohio State Senator Steve Huffman, who
ignited controversy when he asked, in discussing the racial disparity in mortality rates, “Could it just be
that African Americans or the colored population do not wash their hands as well as other groups or wear a
mask or do not socially distance themselves?” (Mogan Gstalter, “Ohio lawmaker asks if ‘colored population’
is hit hard by coronavirus because they ‘don’t wash their hands as well’,” The Hill, June 11, 2020.)

COVID-19 data reports by race. Even when the case information is broken down by race,
confidentiality rules prevent information about the patient’s economic variables from being
matched up with the clinical information.3 Ideally, one would have a large sample of COVID19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients with full information about employment, education,
occupation, income, and so on for each individual but that is not available.4
This note provides an approach to get around these problems partially, using geographic
variation in aggregate variables by county.5 The data used are county aggregates of COVID19 mortality over time, matched with socioeconomic and demographic data by country. The
mortality data are not broken down by race, but in principle one can still test for and measure
racial disparity by looking for correlation between the size of a county’s minority population
share and the county’s mortality rate. If there were no difference in mortality between a
minority group and the rest of the population, the size of the minority share would have
no effect on the county’s mortality rate, so this correlation provides indirect evidence of a
disparity in mortality rates. The exercise follows two steps: First, confirm the existence of a
racial disparity by using a regression to show that minority population shares are correlated
with mortality rates. Second, control for a range of county-level socio-economic factors to
see if the racial disparity weakens or disappears. If it does, then that stands as evidence that
the socioeconomic factor is part of the reason for the racial mortality discrepancy.
We apply this simultaneously to four minorities, as defined by the Census: ‘Black or
African American,’ which will be abbreviated here as ‘African American;’ ‘Hispanic/Latino;’
‘Asian;’ and ‘American Indian and Alaska Native,’ which will be abbreviated here as ‘First
3

For example, Price-Haywood et al. (2020) obtained detailed medical data on thousands of COVID-19
patients at a hospital in Louisiana for a study on racial disparity, but the only information they have on the
socioeconomic status of each patient is the insurance type and the patient’s zip code. On the other hand,
Wiemers et al. (2020) are able to link pre-existing medical risk factors for COVID-19 with socioeconomic
factors using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.

Wood (2020) quotes Merlin Chowkwanyun on the difficulty of identifying the sources of the disparity:
‘That means collecting data that currently do not exist. “When a patient comes to a clinic, they can
self-report their race, but how do they self-report socioeconomic status? How do you actually gather that
information?”’

In general terms, this is a direction suggested by Chowkwanyun and Reed (2020), and is similar in spirit
to the work of the Harvard Public Health Disparities Geocoding Project.

Nations.’ To anticipate results, the main findings are:
(i) For all four minorities, after controlling for state-level effects, there is a strong positive
correlation across counties between the minority’s population share and COVID-19 deaths.
(ii) For Hispanic/Latino and Asian minorities those correlations are fragile, and largely
disappear when we correct for education, occupation, and commuting patterns. (iii) By
contrast, for African Americans and First Nations populations, the correlations are very
robust. Regardless of what other factors are controlled for, a racial disparity in mortality
rates persists. (iv) Surprisingly, for these two groups the racial disparity does not seem to
be due to differences in income, poverty rates, education, occupational mix, or even access
to healthcare insurance, which has been hypothesized by many observers to be a key source
of the disparity. (v) A significant portion of the disparity can, however, be sourced to the
use of public transit.
As a consequence, for African American and First Nations minorities, a large portion of
the disparities is not explained by the socioeconomic factors that we are able to measure.
Other candidates, which are beyond the scope of this note, are listed in Centers for Disease
Control (2020), and include:
(i) Concentration of workers in essential services. This study uses fairly broad occupational categories due to data limitations, but identifying the number of workers in essential
services in each location at each time requires finer occupational data. Of course, ‘essential
service’ is defined by state governments and the criteria can vary over time.
(ii) Differential incidence of pre-exisiting conditions that can make a COVID-19 infection
more dangerous. This is a major factor identified in case-study data by Price-Haywood et al.
(2020), for example. Wiemers et al. (2020) extensively study the socioeconomic determinants
of pre-existing risk factors for COVID-19.
(iii) Differential availability of paid sick leave. In a workplace where workers have no
paid sick leave, workers with symptoms are likely to stay on the job and infect others. This
could be an extremely important channel for the disparity.

4

(iv) Residential segregation. There is an earlier literature on the effects of residential
segregation on healthcare outcomes over and above a household’s own income, education
and other socioeconomic indicators. For example, Hearst et al. (2008) look for an effect of
segregation on infant mortality and find no effect after other factors have been controlled
for.
(v) Discrimination in healthcare services. Hall et al. (2015) survey numerous studies that
demonstrate evidence of implicit racial or ethnic bias in healthcare providers and find some
effect on healthcare outcomes. Hoffman et al. (2016) report evidence that a substantial fraction of health professionals undervalue the pain experienced by African-American patients
due to racial attitudes, and there are claims that African Americans who have had adverse
experiences with healthcare professionals have trouble trusting them and so are slower to
seek treatment (Johnson (2020)).
(vi) ‘Weathering,’ which is defined as “advanced aging caused by bodily wear and tear
from fight-or-flight responses to external stressors, especially racial discrimination.” (Chowkwanyun and Reed (2020).
Related work.
The method in this note is closes to Desmet and Wacziarg (2020), who also use countylevel data to relate COVID-19 outcome data to socioeconomic county characteristics. The
main difference is that they do not focus on the racial disparity. Gross et al. obtain countylevel data from the 28 states whose governments release COVID-19 mortality data broken
down by race in order to measure the racial disparity. Unlike the present note, their focus
is not to try to identify socioeconomic roots of the disparity, but rather to provide a more
accurate measure of the disparity, and especially after correcting for age. Price-Haywood et
al. (2020) obtained confidential data on 3,481 COVID-19 patients at a hospital in Louisiana.
For each patient, the data include medical history and the treatment and outcome of the
COVID-19 infection over time, as well as the type of insurance and the zip code of residence.
That last piece of information is used as a noisy measure of socioeconomic status, as the

5

zip codes served by the hospital are very varied in income and other indicators. They find
an overwhelming racial disparity in COVID-19 outcomes; the vast majority of COVID-19
patients and deaths were African American, although two-thirds of the local population
were white. However, once a patient is admitted, controlling for patient specific information
(including pre-existing conditions), they found that race had no effect on the conditional
survival probability. Wiemers et al. (2020) identify the key pre-existing medical risk factors
for COVID-19 and use data from the 2017 wave of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics
to study the socioeconomic factors that predict these risk factors. Race, age, income, and
education all emerge as important predictors of these risk factors.

Data.

All data in this note are at the county level, from 50 states plus the District of Columbia
and Puerto Rico. The ideal would be individual data but that is not publicly available,
so the present goal is to work with the finest possible geographic units. Mortality data are
available at the level of zip codes, which are typically smaller than counties, but the economic
and demographic variables are typically not available at that level.6 The data include 3,140
counties after counties with missing data have been dropped, covering a total population of
322,179,225. Counties are extremely heterogenous in size, with a highly skewed distribution.
The smallest is Kalawao County, Hawaii, with 75 people, and the largest is Los Angelos
County, with more than 10 million. The mean size is 102,605 and the median is 25,732. For
this reason, all descriptive statistics reported in Table 1 and all regressions are weighted by
population.
6

This is unfortunate, because it is well known that much of the relevant variation exists at the zip code
level. See the use of zip codes locally in the service area of one hospital in Louisiana by Price-Haywood et
al. (2020), and the anecdotal discussion of zip codes in Rubin et al. (2020).

2.1

Mortality data.

Problems in measuring the number of COVID-19 cases are well-known, with large disparities
in the availability of testing and criteria for testing. For that reason, this note focusses on
mortality data, which is less likely to be distorted by such problems. Of course, even cause of
death is subject to judgement calls, as for example when a patient with a severe COVID-19
infection dies of a heart attack that may have been triggered by the infection. The diseasespecific deaths rates are therefore themselves imperfect measures of the prevalence of the
virus but are likely the best available measure.
Data on COVID-19 deaths by county are from usafacts.org, a private non-profit group
that compiles them from local sources. The data are cumulative deaths per day in each
county; here, we use cumulative deaths on 1/22 (the first day in the data), 2/22, 3/22, 4/22,
and 5/19 (the last day in the data at the time of the download). To find deaths during each
month, we take first differences. For two counties, this results in a negative death recorded
for May. Lauderdale County, AL, population 92,585, lists 3 cumulative deaths as of April
but only 2 as of May. Craighead County, Arkansas records 1 death as of April but none as
of May. Both of these anomalies are likely cases of re-classification of a death either by cause
of death or jurisdiction in which it is filed. Some small number of re-classifications likely
occur throughout the data over time, in both directions, but only negative reclassifications
are visible to researchers, so eliminating these cases from the data would introduce a bias.
All mortality figures are scaled as deaths per million. Table 1 shows that the populationweighted average mortality was 135.72 per million in April and 277.67 in May. These figures
are sharply skewed to the right, with three counties of New York City showing above 800
per million while also several less-publicized small counties such as Early County, GA and
Morgan County, CO had deaths above 1,000 per million. At the same time, the median
county had no deaths, while the population-weighted median was 36 in April and 85 in May.

2.2

Demographic and economic data.

The demographic and economic variables come from the American Community Survey (ACS)
of the US Census Bureau. The most recent round of the ACS with complete publicly-available
information required for this exercise is the 2018 survey; the five-year data are used here,
meaning that all data are an average from the five years of the ACS ending in 2018. The
reason is that the 2018 figures alone have the vast majority of counties suppressed due to
Census confidentiality rules.
(i) Racial and ethnic variables. This note examines four minority groups as defined by
the Census: ‘Black or African American,’ which will be abbreviated as ‘African American;’
‘Hispanic Or Latino,’ (which is listed under the Ethnicity categories rather than race, unlike
the others listed here); ‘Asian;’ and ‘American Indian and Alaska Native,’ which will be
abbreviated as ‘First Nations.’ Table 1 shows that the African-American and Hispanic/Latino
populations shares are much larger than the other two, and there is substantial variation in
all four across counties.
(ii) Income, Education, and Health Insurance. In order to check whether or not incidence
of the disease is driven by narrow economic factors, the following are extracted from the ACS,
summarized in rows 8-14 of Table 1: median household income in each county; the fraction
of adults 25 years of age or older without high-school diploma; with high-school diploma
but no further education; with some college (including Associate’s degree from community
college) but no four-year degree; and with a four-year college degree; and the poverty rate
in each county. The ACS also asks respondents if they have any healthcare insurance, and
the fraction who respond in the negative for each county is included in the data here; the
average nationwide stands at 9.37%.
(iii) Commuting. The ACS reports detailed information on how workers get to work,
from which we extract two variables that seem potentially relevant to transmission of the
virus: The fraction of workers who share a vehicle to get to work, and the fraction who
use public transit (not including taxis) to do so. Both means of transport involve being
8

inside a vehicle with other people for the length of the ride and could therefore potentially
help spread the virus. The public-transit fraction is dramatically skewed. Even the 75th
percentile county (weighted, as always, by population) has only a 3.89% share who use public
transit, significantly below the mean of 4.80%. The highest share is held by Kings County,
NY, at 61.36%.
The ability to work from home. Since physical distancing is a key strategy for preventing
spread of the virus, workers who are able to work from home may well have an advantage
in staying healthy. Dingel and Neiman (2020) have attempted to quantify the likelihood
that a given US worker is able to work from home, using the O*NET surveys conducted by
the US Department of Labor, which codify differences across US occupations. For example,
one survey question asks workers if they work outside every day; another question asks if
the worker uses “vehicles, mechanized devices, or equipment” on the job. Occupations for
which a majority of respondents answer affirmatively to either of these questions are coded
by Dingel and Neiman as occupations that cannot be performed at home. Using these and
numerous other criteria, Dingel and Neiman go through the O*NET surveys, coding each
job as work-at-home compatible or not, and then use Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data
on numbers of workers in each job to aggregate up to broader categories. The 22 two-digit
categories are used here because they are what are released by the Census Bureau at the
county level. This note uses the weighted average of the Dingel-Neiman index across those
categories for each county, where the weight for each occupation category is that category’s
share of employment in that county. The last row of Table 1 shows that by this measure
about 39% of workers can work from home, a figure that varies from county to county
with the occupational make-up of employment. We also use the 22 broad BLS occupational
categories separately.

Empirical approach and basic results

The basic estimation is based on the equation:

k
mortalitytc = β0 +Σm βm D(m, t)+β R ROStc +Σk β0k sharekc +Σk Σm βm
sharekc D(m, t)+c,t , (1)

where mortalitytc is COVID-19 deaths per million in county c during month t; D(m, t)
is a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 if m = t and 0 otherwise, where m, t ∈
{M arch, April, M ay}; ROStc is mortality per million during month t in the rest of the
state to which county c belongs; sharekc is the share of minority group k in the population
of county c in the 2018 ACS figures; and c,t is an error term. This regression establishes the
basic correlations between COVID-19 deaths and minority populations.
k
implies a higher-than-average mortality rate
In this equation, any positive value for βm

for minority k, since a mere increase in the population share of a given minority would not
change the overall mortality rate if all racial and ethnic groups had the same mortality rate.
The month-dummy terms βm D(m, t) can capture any national trend, while the rest-of-state
term β R ROStc will capture any state-level shock. States vary in innumerable ways that are
not in the data and that may be relevant to the pandemic; for example, coastal states are
likely to receive more foreign visitors from pandemic-afflicted countries in Europe and east
Asia, and, as Desmet and Wazciarg (2020) show, locations close to an airport that carries a
large number of passengers from the most afflicted countries tend to have more cases. Statelevel policy to deal with the pandemic also varies in numerous ways. With ROStc included
in the regression, the identifying variation will be cross-county variation over time, holding
state-level factors constant. Note: Because the District of Columbia has only one county, it
has no equivalent to this term and so it is omitted from the regressions.
Subsequent regressions add additional terms of the form:

X
Σ m βm
Xc D(m, t),

10

k
where Xc is a characteristic of county c, to see if the minority effects βm
estimated in the

first regression are the result of correlations with other measurable county characteristics.
If part of the reason for a non-zero coefficient βtk in regression (1) is that variable Xc drives
differences in COVID-19 deaths and it is correlated with race or ethnicity, then adding that
term to the regression should reduce the estimated magnitude of βtk .

Results.

4.1

Basic regression.

Column (1) of Table 2 shows the simplest form of regression (1), with only a constant plus
dummies for the months March, April and May. The time trend is obvious from the sharply
increasing, and highly significant, coefficient over time.7 Column (2) adds the control for
state-level shocks, in the form of rest-of-state mortality (ROStc in (1)). This variable enters
with a coefficient of 0.92, strongly significant, and eliminates the effect of the time dummies
while quintupling the R2 . The implication is that the time trends in the data are state-level,
not national.
Column (3) presents the results with the minority population shares added, the main
variable of interest. Because there are hardly any deaths in February and March, the first
two coefficients for each of the four categories are small in magnitude and mostly insignificant,
but for each of them the April and May coefficients are positive, large, and highly significant.
This implies that across the board, controlling for state effects, counties with large minority
populations were hit harder by the pandemic. Column (4) controls for the size of the county
(‘population’), to allow for the possibility that the patterns may be driven by differences
between large urban counties and small rural ones. The population terms have infinitesimal
estimated coefficients, which are small even when multiplied by the standard deviation of
population and are mostly insignificant. In addition, they do not cause any meaningful
7

As a reminder, this and all regressions are weighted by county population.

11

change in the minority-share coefficients.
Henceforth, in all regressions, for completeness and consistency all variables in column
(4) will be included, but the un-interacted and March-interacted minority population shares,
the un-interacted month dummies, and the population terms will all be omitted from tables
for brevity.
To get an idea of the magnitudes, we can think about these estimates in two ways. First,
we can ask how much of an increase in death rates is predicted by a one-standard-deviation
increase in each minority share, and how this compares with the standard deviation in death
rates. For the case of African Americans, a one-standard-deviation increase in the population
share corresponds in April to increased deaths amounting to (4.894)(12.67) = 62 per million,
which is 21% of the standard deviation of deaths in April of 300.57 (taking the standard
deviation of the population share and mortality from rows 3 and 1 of Table 1 respectively).
Thus, in this narrow sense, about a fifth of the April variation can be accounted for by this
one demographic variable. We can call this the ‘variation ratio,’ and compute it for all four
minority groups and both April and May, as reported in the first two columns of Table 3.
From the table it can be seen that the variation ratio is smaller for all groups in May,
because there was so much more variance in the deaths in May due to explosion of the
pandemic in some states but not others. In both months it is largest by a wide margin for
African Americans, because that group has both a large coefficient in Table 2 and a relatively
large population variance.
The second way of thinking about the magnitudes is to see what they imply for differential
mortality rates. Consider a thought experiment in which there are two demographic groups,
numbered 1 and 2, with a mortality rate of m1 and m2 respectively, and assume that both
of these rates are constants. Group 1 comprises sc percent of the population in county c, so
the average mortality rate is:

m̄c =

sc m1 + (100 − sc )m2
.
100
12

(2)

If the share sc varies across counties but the mortality rates m1 and m2 do not,8 we can
estimate

∂ m̄c
∂sc

by regressing m̄c on sc as in (1). If we denote the regression coefficient by β,

we can write:
∂ m̄c
m1 − m2
=
= β,
∂sc
100
and then we can solve (2) and (3) and compute the ratio

(3)
m1
m̄

for group 1:

m1
β(100 − sc )
=1+
.
m̄c
m̄c

(4)

We can call this value the ‘differential mortality ratio’ and compute it for every county.
The expression is easy to understand. If β = 0, so that changes in the minority share have
no effect on mortality rates, then

m1
m̄c

= 1, and there is no disparity. On the other hand, if sc

is close to 100, so that group 1 is almost the whole population, then again

m1
m̄c

will be close to

1. A large value for the differential mortality ratio will be seen when the group is a relatively
small minority (sc is small) and yet addition of a few new members of that minority has a
sizable effect on aggregate mortality (β is large relative to m̄c ).
For both months and all four minorities, the population-weighted median value of this
differential mortailty ratio is listed in the last two columns of Table 3. From the table we
can see that the ratio is well above unity for each case, with the lowest value at 2.1 and the
highest at 14.91. These figures are on the high side compared to others in the literature,
and as later regressions will show, the coefficients on which they are based should be taken
as upper bounds. For example, in figures broken down by race and age group released by
the government of New York City,9 the ratio of deaths per million for African-American or
Hispanic/Latino relative to whites varies from 1.58 to 5.95; in the case of Asians it is close
to 1 for adults. Gross et al. report age-corrected relative mortality ratios by state for states
8

There is very little evidence on whether this assumption holds in practice or not. However, Gross et al.
(2020) compute state-level COVID-19 mortality rates for minorities relative to non-Hispanic whites, from
1
those 28 states that report deaths by race. This would correspond to m
m2 in this thought experiment. The
authors find that the ratio is not correlated with differences in the minority share of population across states.

whose data is broken down by race, ranging from a ratio of 18 for the African-American-towhite ratio in Wisconsin down to 0.44 for Pennsylvania. Their aggregate estimate for the
US is a ratio of 3.57 for African Americans relative to whites, and 1.88 for Hispanic/Latino
relative to white. Price-Haywood et al. (2020) obtained confidential data on 3,481 COVID-19
patients at a hospital in Louisiana and find that 70.6% of those who died were black, while
31% of the population were black, implying a differential mortality ratio

of 2.28.

Controlling for Income, Poverty, and Education.

We now ask the main question of interest: Are the racial and ethnic disparities established
in Tables 2 and 3 caused by underlying economic differences between the different groups?
Table 4 adds county median household income to the regression in column (1), the county
poverty rate in column (2), and the fraction of the county population with no high-school
diploma, with only a high-school diploma, and with come college in column (4). (College
graduates are the omitted category.) Surprisingly, neither income nor poverty rates have
any visible effect on either the minority variables or in themselves. The coefficients on these
variables are small and statistically insignificant. The education variables are similar, but
with two differences. First, they reduce the magnitude and eliminate the significance of
the Hispanic/Latino and Asian variables. Second, they produce negative, sizable, and large
coefficients for the share with Some College, suggesting that an abundance of people in that
educational category lowers deaths. But this must be interpreted with care. First, note that
by the adding-up constraint on education shares, these coefficients imply that reducing all
three shares without a college degree by, say, 5 percentage points, increasing the collegegraduate share by 15 percentage points, would increase COVID-19 deaths. Possibly the
Some College effect has to do with its effect on the prevalence of certain occupations, a point
to which we will return soon.
The bottom line is that the African-American and First-Nations effects are robust to
these controls, but not the other two categories.
14

4.3

Insurance and Commuting.

The racial and ethnic disparities in health insurance in the US are well-known. As of 2018,
5.4% of white, non-Hispanic Americans had no healthcare insurance, compared to 9.7% of
Black Americans and 17.8% of Hispanics (any race) (Berchick et al. (2019), p.14, using the
language for the categories in that report). Since persons with no healthcare insurance are
likely to delay treatment or have no access to treatment at all, including for pre-existing
conditions that may make them more susceptible to COVID-19 death, a natural question
is whether or not the racial disparity in mortality is the result of these racial disparities
in insurance coverage, and indeed, the CDC has listed this factor as a prime suspect for
the morality disparity (Centers for Disease Control, 2020). Commenting on the COVID-19
problem, Timothy Freeman, pastor at Trinity African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church in
Washington, DC, argues that insurance is a major factor: “I have seen diagnostic tests not
performed. . . and hospitalizations cut extremely short – or not happen at all – because of
insurance.” (Johnson, 2020).
Column (1) of Table 5 includes the fraction of county residents who have no healthcare
insurance. Surprisingly, the variable has no real effect at all. The coefficients on the uninsured
share itself are very small and mostly insignificant, and the coefficients on the minority
populations are barely changed from their earlier values, some weakened somewhat and
others strengthened. This is despite the fact that there is plenty of variation in the uninsured
fraction (as shown in Table 1) and the minority shares in the data are highly correlated with
the uninsured fraction.10 We can conclude that access to healthcare insurance is not a driver
of the racial mortality disparity.11
Column (2) shows the result of including the fraction of employed workers 16 years of
10
Regressing the uninsured fraction on the four minority shares gives a negative coefficient for the Asian
share and a positive coefficient for the other three, all at a 0.1% significance level.

It could be that this is a result of the nature of this particular disease which has had very limited
treatment options. Given that most patients who test positive and are not yet in crisis are mostly advised
to rest at home and isolate themselves, this may be an unusual case where health insurance has a limited
role.

age and older who travel to work with a carpool, and (3) shows the corresponding result for
workers who use public transit. The carpooling variable does not change the racial disparity
results much, but the public transit variable has a huge effect. The coefficients are generally
cut in half or more; the Asian variables change sign or become insignificant. Further, the
coefficients on the public transit variable are large, positive, and statistically significant for
April and May. A one-standard deviation increase in the public-transit share in April is
associated with an increase of 167 deaths per million, which is more than half the standard
deviation of deaths in that month.12 This is a very large effect. We can conclude that a
substantial fraction of the racial disparity in mortality is due to the use of public transit.13
It is easy to see with a simple thought experiment why the public transit variable reduces
the size of the African-American effect. In a cross-section regression of the public-transit
fraction on the four minority population shares (omitted for space), all four minority groups
have positive and strongly significant coefficients, although the coefficients are sizable in
magnitude only for the Arican-American share (0.21) and the Asian share (0.63). Apparently all four minority groups use public transit more than the population average. A
one-standard-deviation increase in the African-American population share is thus associated
with a 12.67 × 0.21 = 2.66 percentage-point increase in the fraction who use public transit,
which in turn from Table 5 is associated with 2.66 × 16.74 = 44.54 additional April deaths
per million. This effect through increased use of public transit is more than half the direct
effect of the same African-American increase from Table 2, which is 12.67 × 4.894 = 62.
Note as well that correcting for public transit, the estimate of the differential mortality
ratio from (4) drops to 4.44 in April and 3.23 in May for African Americans and 4.38 in April
and 4.63 in May for First Nations people. These figures are close to the direct estimates of
12

The corresponding negative coefficients for carpooling turn out not to be robust. When the carpooling and public transit variables are added together, the carpooling coefficients become much smaller and
insignificant or borderline significant, but the public-transit variables are essentially unchanged.
13
One might wonder if the public transit variable is simply functioning as a proxy for New York City.
Only four counties in the US show a majority of workers getting to work by public transit, and they are
all part of New York City. Dropping these from the data barely changes the result. It is still possible that
public transit is a proxy for effective local density, a variable emphasized by Desmet and Wacziarg (2020).

16

Gross et al. (2002) for African Americans for the states that report mortality by race.
A final observation about public transit is that it accounts for much of the difference
between mortality in New York City and Los Angeles. Both of these coastal mega-cities
have had a large volume of travel with the most COVID-19-afflicted countries, but their experience of the pandemic has been strikingly different. To take Kings County as an example,
the county that comprises Brooklyn, COVID-19 deaths per million were 1, 628 and 810 in
April and May respectively, while for Los Angeles the figures were 72 and 117, an order of
magnitude smaller. The fraction who use public transit to get to work was 61% for Brooklyn
and 6% for Los Angeles, which by the regression estimates would account for 59% and 78%
of the differential mortality between the two cities in the two months respectively.

4.4

Occupational effects.

Table 6 reports the results of controlling for the fraction of workers in the county who can
work at home, based on Dingel and Neiman (2020). This variable has barely any effect on
the racial-disparity variables, whose coefficients are practically unchanged from column (4)
in Table 2. The coefficients on the work-at-home variable itself are small and insignificant.
It is likely that this variable will have a much greater effect on the economic impact of the
quarantine rather than the incidence of the disease per se, but that question is beyond the
scope of this note.
Finally, in Table 7, we add to the basic regression the local employment share of each
broad BLS occupational category, interacted with a dummy variable for April and May. Once
again, the regression is as in Column (4) of Table 2, but with an additional 42 variables added
(22 occupational categories, with Category 11, Managerial Occupations, omitted, making 21
regressors, each interacted with two month dummies). The effects on the minority shares
are similar to the last column of Table 4 and are omitted here for space. The effects are
strongly significant for African Americans and First Nations shares and mostly insignificant
otherwise. The main point of interest in this table is that there are some occupations that
17

are strongly correlated with local mortality. The most obvious example is Category 31:
Healthcare Support Occupations, which includes occupations such as Home Health Aides,
Nursing Assistants, and Orderlies. The population-weighted standard deviation of this share
is 1.15, so a one-standard-deviation increase in the employment share of that category corresponds to (1.15)(61.87) = 71.15 extra deaths per million in April and (1.15)(34.02) = 39.12
additional ones in May.14 It is not surprising that the more healthcare professionals there
are in a county the more COVID-19 may spread for a great many reasons, but what may
be surprising is that only the support staff have a strong correlation with mortality, and
not Category 29, which has the actual doctors and nurses. A similar observation applies to
Category 39, Personal Care and Support Occupations, which includes among others barbers,
manicurists, and fitness instructors.
We conclude that the occupation make-up does account for the racial and ethnic disparity
for Hispanic/Latino and Asian population shares, but not for African-American and First
Nations people. Further, it is not the number of people in occupations that allow them to
work at home that matters, but rather the presence of certain key occupations.

5

Conclusion.

This note attempts to analyze the socio-economic roots of the widely-noted racial disparity in
COVID-19 mortality. The data is county-level COVID-19 mortality data from 3,140 counties
together with county economic and demographic data. This has the disadvantage that the
county mortality data are not broken down by race, and we cannot tie the socioeconomic
status of any one patient to that patient’s health outcome. The advantage is that is allows
14

This occupation category can give some insight into why the Hispanic/Latino effect essentially disappears
once we control for occupations. In a cross-sectional regression of the Category 31 share on the four minority
population shares, the Hispanic/Latino coefficient comes to 0.015. A one-standard-deviation increase in the
Hispanic/Latino share is therefore associated with a 17 × 0.015 = 0.255 percentage-point increase in the
category-31 employment share, which from Table 7 implies an increase of 0.255 × 61.87 = 15.78 April deaths
per million. This is already much more than enough to account for the April effect of the Hispanic/Latino
share in Table 2. The natural interpretation is that Hispanic/Latino Americans are disproportionately
represented in healthcare support occupations, and this is a large part of the reason for their correlation
with the mortality rates.

18

for a consistent systematic econometric analysis of the whole country.
The main findings as follows:
(i) For all four minorities, there is a strong positive correlation across counties between
the minority’s population share and COVID-19 deaths. (ii) For Hispanic/Latino and Asian
minorities those correlations are fragile, and largely disappear when we correct for education,
occupation, and commuting patterns. (iii) By contrast, for African Americans and First
Nations populations, the correlations are very robust. Regardless of what other factors
are controlled for, a racial disparity in mortality rates persists. (iv) Surprisingly, for these
two groups the racial disparity does not seem to be due to differences in income, poverty
rates, education, occupational mix, or even access to healthcare insurance, which has been
hypothesized by many observers to be a key source of the disparity. (v) A significant portion
of the disparity can, however, be sourced to the use of public transit, which also explains a
large fraction of the difference in mortality between Los Angeles and New York City.
