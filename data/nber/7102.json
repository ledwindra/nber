    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper provides an asymmetric information analysis of the recent East Asian crisis.  It then outlines several lessons from this crisis.  First, there is a strong rationale for an international lender of last resort.  Second, without appropriate conditionality for this lending, the moral hazard created by operation of an international lender of last resort can promote financial instability.  Third, although capital flows did contribute to the crisis, they are a symptom rather than an underlying cause of the crisis, suggesting exchange controls are unlikely to be a useful strategy to avoid future crises.  Fourth, pegged exchange-rate regimes are a dangerous strategy for emerging market countries and make financial crises more likely.\n\n",
