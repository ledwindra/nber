    "abstract": "\n\nWe study how the technological importance of inputs \u2013 measured by cost shares \u2013 is related to the decision to \u201cmake\u201d or \u201cbuy\u201d that input. Using detailed French international trade data and an instrumental variable approach based on self-constructed input-output tables, we show that multinationals vertically integrate high cost share inputs. A stylized incomplete contracting model with both ex-ante and ex-post inefficiencies explains why: technologically more important inputs are \u201cmade\u201d when transaction cost economics type forces overpower property rights type forces. However, additional results show that both types forces are needed to explain the full patterns in the data.\n\n",
