    "abstract": "\n\nWorking consistently through one\u2019s fifties and early sixties is key to attaining retirement security. However, workers also need access to retirement plans \u2013 so they can continue to accumulate resources \u2013 and health insurance \u2013 so they can avoid withdrawing assets in the event of a health shock. Yet, despite the fact that a large literature focuses on nontraditional jobs that often lack these benefits, it is unclear how older workers use these jobs and what the consequences are. This paper uses the Health and Retirement Study to identify nontraditional jobs and relies on sequence analysis to explore how workers ages 50-62 use them. The results suggest that the majority of nontraditional jobs are used by workers consistently, and that fewer workers use these jobs briefly or as a bridge to retirement. In the end, workers consistently in nontraditional jobs end up with less retirement income and are also worse off by a more holistic measure of well-being \u2013 the incidence of depression. Given this situation, expanding benefits to workers in non-traditional jobs could increase their well-being in retirement.\n\n",
