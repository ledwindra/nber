    "abstract": "\n\nThe extent to which new technological knowledge flows across institutional and national boundaries is a question of great importance for public policy and the modeling of economic growth. This paper develops a model of the process generating subsequent citations to patents as a lens for viewing knowledge diffusion. We find that the probability of patent citation over time after a patent is granted fits well to a double-exponential function that can be interpreted as the mixture of diffusion and obsolescence functions.  The results indicate that diffusion is geographically localized.  Controlling for other factors, within-country citations are more numerous and come more quickly than those that cross country boundaries.\n\n",
