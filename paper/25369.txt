Do State Laws Protecting Older Workers from Discrimination Reduce Age Discrimination
in Hiring? Evidence from a Field Experiment

ABSTRACT
We provide evidence from a field experiment in all 50 states on age discrimination in hiring for
retail sales jobs. We relate measured age discrimination – the difference in callback rates
between old and young applicants – to state variation in anti-discrimination laws protecting older
workers. Anti-discrimination laws could boost hiring, although they could have the unintended
consequence of deterring hiring if their main effect is to increase termination costs. We find
some evidence that there is less discrimination against older men and women in states where age
discrimination law allows larger damages, and some evidence that there is lower discrimination
against older women in states where disability discrimination law allows larger damages. But
this evidence is not robust to all of the estimations we consider. However, we reach a robust
conclusion that stronger or broader laws protecting older workers from discrimination do not
have the unintended consequence of deterring their hiring.

Introduction
In the face of population aging in the United States and other countries, policymakers have
focused on efforts to boost the labor supply of older workers, mainly through public pension reforms.
However, several studies suggest that older workers face age discrimination in hiring. 1 Although
discrimination in hiring may not seem closely related to encouraging older people to work longer, it may
actually be essential to significant lengthening of work lives, because many seniors transition to part-time
or shorter-term “partial retirement” or “bridge jobs” at the end of their careers (Cahill et al., 2006;
Johnson, Kawachi, and Lewis, 2014), or return to work after a period of retirement (Maestas, 2010).
In this paper, we study the effects of stronger or broader laws protecting older workers from
discrimination on hiring of older workers. Stronger laws include harsher penalties for being found guilty
of discriminating, and broader laws extend coverage to more employers or workers.
While it may seem natural to expect that stronger discrimination protections for older workers or
workers with disabilities will – if anything – increase hiring of older workers, these laws may in fact be
ineffective at reducing or eliminating age discrimination in hiring. Enforcement relies in large part on
potential rewards to plaintiffs’ attorneys. In hiring cases, it is difficult to identify a class of affected
workers, which inhibits class action suits and thus substantially limits awards. In addition, economic
damages can be small in hiring cases because one employer’s action may extend a worker’s spell of
unemployment only modestly. Terminations, in contrast, can entail substantial lost earnings and pension
accruals.
Moreover, it could be worse. If age discrimination laws fail to reduce discrimination in hiring,
but make it harder to terminate older workers, these laws could have the unintended consequence of
deterring hiring of older workers (Bloch, 1994; Posner, 1995). This hypothesis was explored most fully
by Oyer and Schaefer (2002), with regard to the effects of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (CRA91) on
employment of blacks and females. CRA91 expanded the rights of plaintiffs bringing discrimination

claims – increasing damages when intentional discrimination could be established, increasing damages
for discrimination in terminations of employment, and establishing a right to jury trial, which is viewed as
more likely to lead to outcomes favorable to plaintiffs. 2 When discrimination laws make it harder to
terminate a protected group, some firms may respond by avoiding hiring from that group, and Oyer and
Schaefer find evidence of this effect. 3 In other words, by raising termination costs, anti-discrimination
protections can have the unintended consequence of deterring hiring of the protected group – and this
potential is reinforced by the potentially small damages in hiring cases.
We consider not only age discrimination laws, but also disability discrimination laws. As argued
in Stock and Beegle (2004), Neumark, Song, and Button (2017), and Khan and Button (2018), disability
discrimination laws may be important in protecting older workers, in particular, from discrimination.
Disabilities that can limit work, and hence also likely limit major life activities and trigger protection by
disability discrimination laws, rise steeply with age, especially past age 50 or so (e.g., Rowe and Kahn,
1997); correspondingly, employer expectations that a worker will develop a disability in the near future –
posing future accommodation costs – should also rise steeply with age.
Indeed, disability discrimination laws may do more to protect many older workers than do age
discrimination laws. Many ailments associated with aging have become classified as disabilities (Sterns
and Miklos, 1995). These ailments can give some older workers an option of pursuing discrimination
claims under either the ADEA or the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), or the corresponding state
laws. The combined effect of potential coverage under both age and disability discrimination laws may
be to increase protections. For example, the ADA does more to limit defenses against discrimination
claims. 4 A disability discrimination claim does require proving a disability, but as we explain, doing so

2

Oyer and Schaefer focus on race and sex because CRA91 had much less impact on cases brought under the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA).
3
Lahey (2008b) reaches a similar conclusion regarding age discrimination laws, based on differences between state
and federal laws (in some states). However, Neumark (2009) argues that her evidence more likely indicates that
stronger age discrimination laws boosted the employment of protected workers.
4
Unlike the ADEA, the ADA does not include an exception for bona fide occupational qualifications (BFOQs).
BFOQ exceptions arise when age is strongly associated with other factors that pose legitimate business or safety
concerns (e.g., Stock and Beegle, 2004; Posner, 1995; Starkman, 1992). Furthermore, age-related disabilities might
be judged as amenable to “reasonable accommodation” by employers under disability discrimination laws, which

2

can be substantially easier under some state disability discrimination laws than under the ADA. 5
To garner evidence on whether stronger age and disability discrimination laws increase hiring of
older workers, we conduct a large-scale resume correspondence study covering all 50 states, to fully
capture variation in state age and disability discrimination laws. 6 The evidence from the resume
correspondence study provides direct measures of discrimination in hiring. We utilize information on
state age discrimination laws that extend beyond the federal ADEA, and state disability discrimination
laws that extend beyond the ADA, to study the relationships between these state laws and the direct
measures of age discrimination in hiring from the field experiment. 7 Our focus is on discrimination
against job applicants aged 64 to 66, who are at or near the age of retirement, making this age range
particularly important for thinking about whether age discrimination hinders policy reforms to lengthen
work lives, and whether anti-discrimination laws can help.
One important caveat is that the variation in age discrimination that we measure is crosssectional, not longitudinal. This limitation is dictated by the collection of data in our experiment, which
occurs over a short period and could only be done contemporaneously, 8 combined with the fact that there
have been very few changes in state anti-discrimination laws in recent decades (Neumark and Song, 2013;
Neumark et al., 2017; Button, Armour, and Hollands, 2018a, 2018b). 9 Thus, our evidence could in
principle reflect other factors correlated with both employer decisions about callbacks for older workers

usually require “reasonable accommodation” of the worker, making it much harder to justify an apparently
discriminatory practice on the basis of business necessity (Gardner and Campanella, 1991).
5
Under the ADA and similar state laws, plaintiffs need to prove that they have a condition that “…substantially
limits one or more major life activities…” (42 U.S. Code §12102 (1)). This has proven difficult, leading plaintiffs to
lose the vast majority of cases (Colker, 1999). Even with the definition of disability being broader now after the
ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), proving coverage is not easy for many conditions.
6
This is a substantial expansion from the 12 cities in 11 states studied in Neumark et al. (forthcoming), although we
limit the analysis to retail jobs – whereas the previous study sent out resumes for three other types of jobs. The
limited state-level variation in Neumark et al. (forthcoming) is not enough to identify the effects of features of age
and disability discrimination laws separately, which motivates our expansion to all states in the present study.
7
There is non-experimental evidence on how these state laws affect labor market outcomes for older workers or
workers with disabilities, which is discussed in the concluding section of this paper in relation to our evidence. We
are aware of only two other papers that look at variation in experimental evidence on discrimination across
jurisdictions with different anti-discrimination laws – Tilcsik’s (2011) study of discrimination against gay men, and
Ameri et al.’s (2018) study of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.

context of hiring differences of those with and without criminal backgrounds), see Agan and Starr (2018).

vs. younger workers, and anti-discrimination laws. However, callback outcomes are responses to very
similar resumes in a single industry, and do not reflect, for example, decisions of older workers to apply
for jobs, or population differences between older and younger workers. Coupled with the fact that the
anti-discrimination laws we study have been in effect for many years and typically decades, candidate
explanations for a spurious relationship between the discrimination laws and the hiring discrimination we
measure are not obvious. Finally, our evidence – in some estimations – of potentially beneficial effects
on hiring of stronger anti-discrimination laws for older workers is consistent with non-experimental (or
quasi-experimental) evidence based on state adoption of anti-discrimination laws, suggesting that there is
corroborating evidence from longitudinal variation in state anti-discrimination laws.
Correspondence Study Evidence on Age Discrimination
Experimental audit or correspondence (AC) studies of hiring are generally viewed as the most
reliable means of inferring labor market discrimination (e.g., Fix and Struyk, 1993), because the group
differences they (potentially) detect are very hard to attribute to non-discriminatory factors. It is true that
AC correspondence studies do not directly distinguish between taste discrimination and statistical
discrimination. However, both are illegal under U.S. law. 10 Indeed, the last few years have witnessed an
explosion of AC studies of discrimination. 11 Most recent research – including the present paper – use the
correspondence study method, which creates fake applicants (on paper, or electronically in more recent
work) and captures “callbacks” for job interviews. Correspondence studies can collect far larger samples
than audit studies, which require in-person interviews. And correspondence studies avoid “experimenter
effects” that can influence the behavior of the actual applicants used in audit studies (Heckman and
Siegelman, 1993).
This paper significantly extends the analysis in Neumark et al. (forthcoming). That study focused
on improving correspondence study evidence on age discrimination. One of the key concerns was the
sensitivity of results to the common practice of giving older and younger applicants similar lower levels

10

Neumark et al. (forthcoming) devote considerable attention to weighing these two alternative explanations –
analyses we do not delve into here.

of labor market experience, consistent with the AC study paradigm of making applicants identical except
with respect to the group characteristic in question. Although the absence of relevant experience
commensurate with an older applicant’s age may be a negative signal, estimates of age discrimination
were generally not sensitive to giving older workers more realistic resumes, including for the retail sales
jobs on which we focus in this paper. In addition, Neumark et al. designed their resumes to be able to
implement a method developed in Neumark (2012) to address the Heckman critique of AC study
evidence (Heckman and Siegelman, 1993; Heckman, 1998) – namely, that experimental estimates of
discrimination can be biased in either direction if the groups studied have different variances of
unobservables. The same resume design is used in the present study.
The Experimental Design
The present study builds on the approach and findings from the prior study. The extension to all
50 states is critical for studying the effects of anti-discrimination laws. At the same time, the extensive
resources required to extend to all 50 states necessitated omitting some of the occupations included in the
previous study. In particular, we omit administrative assistant, security, and janitor jobs, and focus only
on jobs in retail sales. A clear implication of this limitation is that the evidence must be regarded as a
case study, which may not generalize to other low-skill jobs. 12 On the other hand, of the jobs included in
Neumark et al. (forthcoming), retail sales is the one for which both male and female applicants were
submitted, so in the present study we obtain evidence on whether there are difference in the effects of
anti-discrimination laws for men and women. In addition, given the evidence that in retail sales there was
no difference in measured age discrimination whether high-experience or low-experience resumes were
used for older applicants, in this paper we use low-experience resumes that match those of younger
applicants. This simplified the resume creation because a long work history did not have to be developed
for the older applicants.
Methods

12

These kinds of studies typically use a very limited number of jobs. For example, Farber et al. (2017) focus only
on age discrimination against women in administrative assistant jobs.

5

The core analysis uses probit models for callbacks (C) as a function of dummy variables for age
(S for older/senior) and observables from the resumes (X). 13 The latent variable model (for C*) is
(1)

Ci* = α + γSi + Xiδ + εi.

In this basic model, the null hypothesis of no discrimination implies that γ = 0 (for older

workers). We always estimate the model for men and women separately.

The contribution of this paper is to estimate the effects of state anti-discrimination laws affecting
older workers on relative callbacks of older versus younger applicants. We do this by modifying equation
(1) to include interactions between the dummy variable for older applicants and a vector of dummy
variables for these state laws. To ensure that we estimate the independent effects of each of the variations
in state anti-discrimination protections, we simultaneously estimate the effects of the different antidiscrimination laws that we study, because the presence or absence of different features of state laws are
correlated across states, as documented in the next section.
Because we include state dummy variables (as well as other controls), we do not include the main
effects of the state anti-discrimination laws. Excluding the state dummy variables, and including the main
effects of the laws, would generate a less saturated model, whereas the models we estimate allow more
flexibly for differences in callback rates for younger workers across states than only variation correlated
with the state anti-discrimination laws. Of course, we have to assume that state-by-age interactions can
be excluded from the model to estimate the interactive effects of interest. Adding to equation (1) an ‘s’
subscript to denote states, and defining As as the vector of dummy variables capturing state antidiscrimination laws, we augment the model to be
(2)

Cis* = α + γSis + Sis∙Asγ′ + Xisδ + εis,

where X includes the state dummy variables. Our interest centers on whether stronger or broader state
anti-discrimination laws are associated with differences in the relative callback rate of older workers,
captured in γ′.

The calculation of marginal effects of interaction variables in probit (or logit) models is more

13

complicated than in linear models (Ai and Norton, 2003). In a simple difference-in-differences model,
with two states, the latent variable model corresponding to equation (2) is
(3)

Cis* = α + γSis + Sis∙Asγ′ + As𝛾𝛾′′ + Xisδ + εis,

where we have introduced a dummy for the state with a particular law, and X now does not include the
state dummy variable. In this case, we compute the marginal effect of Sis∙As by applying the Delta
method to the expression
(4)

�δ�) − Φ(α
�δ�)},
Φ(α
� + γ� + γ�′ + γ�′′ + X
� + γ�′′ + X
� + γ� + X
�+X

where Φ(∙) denotes the standard normal CDF, and �
X denotes sample means. The first difference is the
difference in probabilities of callbacks between old applicants in the state with the law, and young

applicants in the same state, and the second difference is between old and young applicants in the state
without the law.
When there are multiple states, the latent variable equation has a vector of state dummy variables,
which absorb the main effect of As. Unlike in a linear model, where the state dummy variables difference
out, we need to construct an average estimated intercept for the states with a law and the states without a
law (paralleling the use of α
� + γ�′′ for treated states and α
� for control states in equation (4)). We do this by

specifying the model to include dummy variables for every state, and no intercept, and construct the
appropriate intercept for states with and without the policy as the sample-weighted averages of state
dummy variable coefficients for the states with or without a law, including these averages in the

corresponding first difference. Defining Ps,A=1 as the proportion of observations in state s, relative to all
states with A = 1, and similarly for Ps,A=0, and defining θ�s as the estimated coefficient of the dummy

variable for state s, α
� + γ�′′ in the first difference shown in equation (4) is replaced by
(5)

∑s∊A=1{θ�s ∙ Ps,A=1 }

and α
� in the second difference in equation (4) is replaced by
(6)

∑s∊A=0{θ�s ∙ Ps,A=0 }. 14

14
Our earlier comment about linear probability model estimates being very similar to the probit estimates applies
equally well to the estimated interactions between the policy variables and the indicator for older applicants. Of
course, with the linear probability model the estimation of interaction effects is much simpler.

7

As explained in Neumark (2012), allowing for different variances of the unobservables for young
and old workers requires adding to some of the resumes characteristics that shift the callback probability,
which in this study are skill measures described below, and estimating a heteroskedastic probit model. In
this model, the age of applicants has two separate effects. The first effect is the usual discrimination
channel we have in mind, exactly paralleling the effect of S in equation (1), which can be interpreted,
perhaps most simply, as the effect of age on the employer’s valuation of the worker’s marginal product –
just as in the Becker employer discrimination model. The second effect is via the variance of the
unobservable, and as explained in Neumark (2012) this effect is an artifact of the details of the
experimental design and is the source of the bias identified by the Heckman critique. Thus, adapting
estimation of the effects of age, and its interactions with anti-discrimination laws, requires separating out
these two effects and focusing on the first. Denoting by 𝜎𝜎 the ratio of the standard deviation of the

unobservable for older applicants to the standard deviation for younger applicants, the difference-indifference paralleling equation (4) becomes

where 𝜎𝜎 appears in the first and third expressions because they apply to older applicants.

Equation (7) can be decomposed in two ways to isolate the effect of age through the level, each of

which entails adding and subtracting terms that sum to zero. The first decomposition is

In either equation (8) or (8’), the first difference-in-difference isolate the effects of age

(corresponding to the parameter estimate γ�) and the age-by-law interaction (γ�′), and the second

difference-in-difference isolates the effect of age via the variance of the unobservable. It is the first effect

8

– the effect via the “level” – that provides unbiased estimates of the effects of age, and of age-by-law
interactions, which we obtain by netting out the second effect. There are two alternative decompositions
depending on whether we evaluate the first effect based on the variance of the unobservable for older
applicants (equation (8)) or young applicants (equation (8’)). 15
Resumes
Our overarching strategy in designing the resumes for our study was to use empirical evidence
whenever possible in making decisions about creating the resumes, to minimize decisions that might limit
the external or “comparison” validity of the results. This evidence comes from a large sample of publicly
available resumes that we downloaded from a popular national job-hunting website, and then scraped to
convert the resume information to data, as well as public-use data. 16
We use an age range for young workers similar to other studies (29-31), but compare results to
older workers near the retirement age (64-66), whereas other studies tend to focus on ages closer to 50.
The older ages are more interesting in light of policy efforts to prolong work lives; as noted above, many
workers near these ages transition to other jobs for a time, and disabilities are more likely to emerge. We
convey age on the resumes via high school graduation year. Based on ages of our artificial job applicants,
we chose common names (by sex) for the corresponding cohorts based on data from the Social Security
Administration, choosing first and last names that were most likely to signal that the applicant was
Caucasian. In response to each job ad, we send out a quadruplet of resumes consisting of a young and old
male applicant and a young and old female applicant.
Neumark et al. (forthcoming) used the resume database to document that there are older
applicants in retail sales, and they apply for jobs on-line. In addition, data from the Current Population

15

This modifies the approach in Neumark (2012), where the marginal effect of group membership (there were no
interactions with laws) was calculated treating the indicator of group membership as continuous rather than discrete,
which has the advantage of providing a unique decomposition into the effect via the level and via the variance.
However, for marginal effects involving interacted variables, this approach is not applicable.
16
The discussion here is brief. Many additional details are provided Neumark et al. (forthcoming), including the online appendix, although there are some differences because that paper presents a more complex study with additional
occupations, additional resume types, etc. With regard to resume creation, we do not do anything in the current
paper that extends beyond what was done in Neumark et al. (forthcoming), but in some cases what we do is more
limited.

9

Survey (CPS) Tenure Supplement show a sizable representation of low-tenure older workers in the
occupations that make up retail sales (retail salespersons and cashiers in the Census occupational
classification). And the data further show that retail sales capture appreciable shares of new hiring of
older workers (and higher shares for the types of low-skill retail jobs that could plausibly be candidates
for the study), and that these shares are in the upper tier of industries in terms of the proportions of older
people hired.
As noted above, we use cities in all 50 states to maximize external validity and to include all
variation in state anti-discrimination laws. This contrasts quite sharply with most of the past studies,
which typically use one or perhaps two cities (Pager, 2007).
Because low-skill workers have low geographic mobility (Molloy, Smith, and Wozniak, 2011),
we also target the resumes to retail jobs in specific cities, with the job and education history on each
resume matching the city from which the job ad to which we apply originates. This need to customize
resumes to the city in which a job application is submitted is the reason we limited the analysis in this
paper to retail sales jobs.
We constructed realistic job histories on our resumes using the actual jobs held by retail job
applicants in the resume database we scraped, and the resume characteristic randomizer program created
by Lahey and Beasley (2009). We chose job turnover rates based on secondary data for retail trade from
the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). We used the resume randomizer to produce a
large number of job histories, and then selected a smaller set that looked the most realistic based on the
resumes found on the job-hunting website. From this sample of acceptable histories, we created four job
histories for each city (and for each of styles of resumes we create), adding employer names and
addresses randomly to each job in our final job histories, based on actual employers present in each city at
the relevant dates, relying mainly on national chains that had stores in many cities.
Half the resume quadruplets we sent out included higher skills, and half did not. 17 For higherskilled resumes, there are seven possible skills, five of which are chosen randomly (so that they are not

This skill variation across resumes is needed to address the Heckman critique (Neumark, 2012).

10

perfectly collinear within the higher-skilled resumes). Five of the seven skills are general: a Bachelor of
Arts degree; fluency in Spanish as a second language; an “employee of the month” award on the most
recent job; one of three volunteer activities (food bank, homeless shelter, or animal shelter); and an
absence of typographical errors. Two skills are specific to retail sales, including Microsoft Office and
programs used to monitor inventory (VendPOS, AmberPOS, and Lightspeed).
Each of the four resumes in the quadruplet was randomly assigned a different resume template,
which ensured that all four resumes looked different. Most other characteristics were randomly and
uniquely assigned to each resume in each quadruplet to further ensure that the applicants were
distinguished from each other. 18
Applying for Jobs
We identify jobs to apply for using a common job-posting website. Research assistants read the
posts regularly to select jobs for the study, using a well-specified set of criteria. Jobs had to be entry level
(e.g., not managers or supervisors), and the ads could not require in-person applications or inquiries by
phone, or require applicants to use an external website. The ads could not require additional documents
we had not prepared (e.g., a salary history, etc.), or skills that our resumes did not have.
Research assistants saved the list of jobs to apply for in a shared folder. We wrote Python code to
automate the application process from the jobs put in this shared folder. This substantially reduced labor
costs, removed human error such as attaching the wrong resume, and ensured that jobs applications used a
uniform procedure. The code matched the job ad data to the applicant based on city and date. Each day
was randomly assigned a different quadruplet of resumes in terms of skill levels, and currently employed
or unemployed. Within each quadruplet the order of resumes was randomized. The code ran every other
day and added 7- to 8-hour delays between applications to the same job. Our sample size resulted from
an explicit ex ante data collection plan that covered two academic quarters, in which we collected as
much data as the available job ads would allow. No data were analyzed until the data collection was
complete. During that time period, we sent 14,428 applications to 3,607 jobs.

18
Other details of the resumes, including the assignment of residential addresses and schools, as well as examples of
resume types, are provided in Neumark et al. (forthcoming, and on-line appendix).

Collecting Responses
Responses to job applications could be received by email or phone. All responses were
forwarded to a central email account, with voicemails arriving as attachments. We then read each email
and listened to each voicemail to record the response. We often used additional information to match a
response to a specific job ad, using information on the job ads recorded during the job application
process, like company name, and unique ids from emails sent as replies to the job-listing website
submission. Identifying information that was extracted from voicemails included, when possible, the firm
name, applicant name, job title, and any information that could be used to narrow down the list of
possible job ads (e.g., how long ago they received the resume). The information extracted from the
voicemail was used to match each voicemail to a job ad. Table 1 reports the distribution of responses by
phone or email (or both).
Each response was coded as an unambiguous positive response (e.g., “Please call to set up an
interview”), an ambiguous response (e.g. “Please return our call, we have a few additional questions”), or
an unambiguous negative response (e.g. “Thank you for your interest, but the job has been filled”). To
avoid having to classify subjectively the ambiguous responses, they were treated as callbacks. 19
Disproportionate Numbers of Ads and Weighting
We applied to retail jobs in one city in each state (these are listed in Table 2, discussed below).
Under the assumption that we applied to the number of retail jobs in proportion to the actual number of
retail jobs in each city, using the microdata unweighted would provide estimates representative of the
universe of retail jobs in these cities – or at least those that advertise on the job-posting website we use.
As it turns out, however, we obtained quite different numbers of observations by city relative to what
would be expected based on the number of retail jobs in the city. 20

19

The ambiguous responses are 7.8% of all cases coded as positive callbacks.
Most previous correspondence studies only focus on estimating discrimination in callbacks (rather than
differences associated with laws), and most use a small number of cities. In her review of the experimental
literature, Pager (2007, p. 120) describes only a small number of studies that use more than one location, and states
that none in her survey used more than two. In a more recent study that provides a comprehensive survey of
experiments related to discrimination against older workers (Baert et al., 2016), none of the studies covered focus on
differences across jurisdictions, except, at most, to compare mean differences in callback rates. And none discuss

20

12

The non-representative numbers of job ads occurred for several reasons. First and foremost, for
some cities the website from which we took the job ads defines the market as the whole city, whereas for
others, when there are multiple markets (which occurs for very large cities), we used a single market
because of the resource constraints imposed by collecting data for cities in all 50 states. 21 Second, for a
couple of very large cities where there was a huge number of ads, the research assistants did not apply to
every job, whereas for the other cities they applied to all of them. And third, the frequency with which
employers post ads on the job-hunting website we use in this study, relative to other methods of posting
jobs, can vary. Figure 1 displays information on differences in representativeness across cities. We see,
for example, a very large number of jobs in Seattle, WA in the experimental data (black bar), relative to
the share of retail jobs computed from the Quarterly Workforce Indicators data for retail, in the ranges
covering the age groups we study (gray bar). 22 In contrast, New York, NY has a large number of retail
jobs, as does Los Angeles, CA, but fewer observations in the experimental data.
As a result of this disproportionate sampling of retail job ads, in our core analyses we reweight
the data by the ratio of the percent of employment in the QWI data (by sex) to the percent of observations
in the experimental sample in the city. This will make the estimates representative of the distribution of
retail jobs by city in the QWI data. 23 As an alternative, we reweight the data by one over the share of

issues of representativeness of the cities in their sample or consider the issue of weighting. Of the two papers that
focus on differences across jurisdictions, none have reweighted the data to be representative. Ameri et al. (2018)
applied to jobs across the United States, but they do not report differences across states, or discuss
representativeness or weighting. Tilcsik (2011) applied to jobs in seven states, and also does not reference
representativeness across states or weighting.
21
For example, the job board has separate markets for each borough of New York City, and for Los Angeles the
board has separate markets for “Central LA,” the San Fernando Valley, the San Gabriel Valley, the “Westside-South
Bay,” the Long Beach area, and the Antelope Valley. In contrast, for the greater Seattle area, the entire city of
Seattle is contained within one market, with only adjacent counties and the “Eastside” (e.g., Bellevue) being
relegated to other markets, resulting in more job ads per day in the Seattle market we used than for the markets we
used in New York City or in Los Angeles.
22
These data are for NAICS codes 44-45, for the MSA-level data, for ages 25-34, 55-64, and 65-99, and for men
and women. The percentages reported by the gray bars are the sums across age ranges and sexes for the MSA,
divided by the totals for the MSAs used in the states covered by the graph. We use only the portion of the MSA in
the state in question. The QWI data are for 2015Q1-Q3. Given the lag in the release of QWI data, this is the closest
we could get to the period in which the experimental data were collected (February-July, 2016); note we try to
overlap quarters to capture the same seasonal pattern. For two states (Michigan and Wyoming) we have to use data
from 2014Q1-Q3, since the 2015 data were not yet available.
23
For example, the Seattle data for both men and women are weighted by 0.27, reflecting the overrepresentation of
Seattle observations by a factor of about four in the experimental data (Figure 1). And the New York City data are

13

observations in the city. This gives the observations for each city equal weight, and hence makes the data
representative of cities. 24 Figure 1 shows the reweighted percentages (which are all equal in the equalweighting case).
If one views the goal of our analysis as estimating population descriptive statistics – namely, the
difference in callback rates between older and younger applicants, and the differences in callback rates by
age under different anti-discrimination laws – then these two weighting choices are consistent with the
simple advice, in Solon, Haider, and Wooldridge (2015), to use weights to obtain representative estimates
when the sample is unrepresentative. Between the two choices, we view reweighting the data to be
representative of retail jobs to be more meaningful, as it provides estimates of the differences faced, on
average, by workers applying to these jobs. Solon et al. (2015) also argue that researchers should present
both weighted and unweighted estimates. Differences in estimates can imply model misspecification
(most importantly, in our case, heterogeneity in callback rate differences – possibly including the
differences associated with variation in laws – across different states). Our two differently weighted sets
of estimates might be expected to reveal this kind of misspecification if it was important, as the weighting
of different states varies quite dramatically. In contrast, if the callback rate differences are similar across
states, then we should obtain similar estimates whether we weight the data to be representative of jobs or
of states. 25
Coding of Anti-Discrimination Laws
Our coding of age discrimination laws and disability discrimination laws was developed for the
analysis in Neumark and Song (2013) and Neumark et al. (2017); these papers also report some analyses
of the effects of these laws using non-experimental data. We updated these laws to those that were active
at the time of our data collection (2016). The compilation of information on these laws, and updating

weighted by 4.74 for men and 4.42 for women, consistent with the underrepresentation of New York City
observations in the experimental data (Figure 1).
24
Figure 1 also shows that the reweighting is extreme for Arkansas, South Dakota, and Wyoming, owing to very
small numbers of observations for these states. (The same would be true for West Virginia, but it is dropped
because there are no callbacks for West Virginia so there are perfect predictions for the probit model.) We therefore
drop observations for these states, all of which have fewer than 10 observations (by sex).
25
As yet another check, we also report unweighted estimates.

14

these laws, entailed extensive background research on state statutes and their histories, culled from legal
databases including Lexis-Nexis, Westlaw, and Hein Online, as well as many other sources (e.g., case
law, secondary sources, law journal articles, state offices, unpassed bills, and jury instructions). This is
discussed in-depth in our on-line legal appendix.
The laws as of 2016 are reported in Table 2. 26 We focus on the two aspects of age discrimination
laws that past research suggests are important. The first is the minimum firm-size cutoff for the law to
apply. 27 We use a firm-size cutoff of fewer than 10 workers to capture state laws that extend to
substantially smaller firms (the minimum for the ADEA to apply is 20). The smaller firm-size cutoff may
be important because older workers are more likely to be employed at smaller firms (Neumark and Song,
2013). The second is whether compensatory or punitive damages are allowed; such damages are not
allowed under federal law. 28 We characterize a state law that specifies a lower firm-size cutoff as a
broader law, and one that allows larger damages as a stronger law.
State disability discrimination laws are sometimes stronger or broader than the federal ADA in
three principal ways, all captured as well in Table 2. Like with age laws, there is a minimum firm size to
which disability discrimination laws apply. The minimum firm size for the ADA to apply is 15; in our
analysis we distinguish states with a firm-size minimum lower than 10, the same as for age discrimination
laws. Indeed, Table 2 shows that there is virtually no independent variation in whether the firm-size
minimum is lower for age discrimination or disability discrimination laws. There is only a handful of
states where this differs, and some are small states without much data (e.g., Arkansas and South Dakota).

26

Table 2 reveals that the distribution of stronger protections across states does not reflect the usual pattern related
to generosity of social programs, minimum wages, etc. For example, some southern states have among the strongest
anti-discrimination protections.
27
For example, in Florida a worker who works at a firm that employs fewer than 15 employees is not covered under
the Florida state law. On the contrary, all employees in Colorado are covered by state law because it is applicable to
all firms with at least one employee.
28
See United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (2002). Some states require proof of intent to
discriminate in order for compensatory or punitive damages to be awarded, whereas others require “willful”
violation. Because the federal law allows additional liquidated, non-punitive damages (double back pay and
benefits) when there is “willful” violation, the question of whether the state requires intent or willful violation may
seem to be potentially relevant in deciding whether a state law offers greater protection. However, willful violation
is a much stricter standard than intent (Moberly, 1994). Moreover, compensatory or punitive damages are almost
certainly greater than liquidated damages, and they can be much greater. As a consequence, a state law that
provides compensatory or punitive damages, whether or not this requires proof of intent or willful violation, clearly
entails stronger remedies than the federal law.

15

As a consequence, we code a single dummy variable for whether the firm-size cutoff is lower than 10 for
either the age discrimination law or the disability law (or both).
There is also variation in damages, through higher or uncapped compensatory and punitive
damages, relative to the capped damages available under the ADA. We distinguish states with larger
damages than the ADA; we base this classification on punitive rather than compensatory damages, since
punitive damages are likely to drive large judgments.
Finally, state laws vary in terms of the definition of disability – a different dimension of the
breadth of anti-discrimination laws. Most states adopt the ADA definition, either explicitly or via case
law. Some states use a laxer definition, changing a key part of the definition of disability from
“substantially limits one or more major life activities” to either “materially limits” (Minnesota) or just
“limits” (California) (Button, 2018). Other states vary the definition of disability by requiring that the
disability be “medically diagnosed” without regard to whether the impairment limits major life activities
(Long, 2004); the disability definition in these states is the broadest. The table includes information on
both dimensions of the definition of disability, and we use both in our analysis.
Results
Basic Callback Rates
Figures 2-4 display information on callback rates by age and by sex. Figure 2 plots the callback
rates for young and older male applicants, and Figure 3 plots them for young and older female applicants.
The evidence across all the states in our sample is remarkably consistent, as the callback rate is higher for
young applicants in nearly every state, and usually notably so. This consistency in the callback rate
difference is particularly evident for women, where there is only one state (Maine) for which the callback
rate for older applicants is higher. For men, there are eight states. However, most are states with very
small number of observations; the exceptions are Florida and North Carolina, for which the numbers of
observations are higher but the estimated differences in callback rates are very small.29 Nonetheless,
there is some variation across states, which suggests that studies that include only a few cities or states –

29
Across all the job ads, 3.6 percent of the observations come from Florida, and 2.4 percent from North Carolina.
For the other six states, these percentages range from 0.08 percent to 1.2 percent.

16

which is almost of them (Pager, 2007; Neumark, 2018) – could generate results that are not nationally
representative.
Figure 4 provides a contrast between the results by age for men versus women. The bars to the
left of zero indicate how much lower the callback rate is for older applicants, and the comparison shows
that the difference is much more often larger for female applicants, consistent with stronger evidence of
age discrimination against older women.
Table 3 aggregates the data, reporting raw differences in callback rates by age and statistical tests
of whether callback rates are independent of age; 30 here, as in our preferred specifications, the data are
weighted to be representative of retail jobs in the cities in our experiment. In Panel A, for males, we find
strong overall evidence of age discrimination, with callback rates statistically significantly lower by 6.11
percentage points for older workers compared to younger workers, or 26.47% lower. The evidence in
Panel B, for females, similarly points to age discrimination. The absolute and relative differences are
larger (8.06 percentage points and 31.60%, respectively). These results are similar to those in Neumark et
al. (forthcoming), although there the callback differential was larger for women (about 10%, versus 6%
for men). 31
Multivariate Estimates
Table 4 reports results of probit estimates for callbacks (equation (1)), showing marginal effects.
In each case, we first report results with controls for the state, the order in which applications were
submitted, current employment/unemployment, and skills. We then add controls for an extensive set of
resume features listed in the table notes. The random assignment of age to resumes implies that the
controls should not affect the estimated differences associated with age, and that is reflected here, as the
estimates in Table 4 are very similar to those in Table 3, with an estimated shortfall in callbacks of 6.4-6.7
percentage points for older men, and 8.1-8.3 percentage points for older women.

30

This test treats the observations as independent. In the regression (probit) analyses that follow, the standard errors
are clustered appropriately.
31
Note that the callback rates at all ages are higher for women than for men. Similarly, Neumark et al.
(forthcoming), Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004), and Button and Walker (2018) did not find discrimination against
women in retail.

17

In this and subsequent tables the estimates are clustered at the age-by-state level. We do this
because the policy variation we study when we estimate the effects of state anti-discrimination laws on
callbacks varies by state and by age. 32
Given that the additional resume feature controls make essentially no difference to the estimates,
nor should they, going forward we use the more parsimonious specifications in columns (1) and (3).
These specifications retain the skill variables we added to address the Heckman critique (as well as the
unemployment and order of application variables).
Adding State Anti-Discrimination Laws
We next turn to the main contribution of this paper – the estimation of the effects of state antidiscrimination laws protecting older workers on callback rates for older relative to younger workers. This
analysis is based on equation (2) and equations (4)-(6). Our first estimates are reported in Table 5; these
estimates use our preferred weighting by retail jobs (as in Tables 3 and 4).
The main effects of “Old” refer to states where the federal law binds, and the interactions with the
features of the anti-discrimination laws capture the differential in the relative callback rate where there is
a stronger or broader state law along the dimension considered. We find no statistically significant
evidence that lower firm-size cutoffs reduce discrimination against older job applicants (which would be
reflected in positive coefficient estimates). The two estimates for men are negative, and the two estimates
for women are positive; but they are quite small relative to other estimates discussed next, and none are
statistically insignificant.
The estimates for larger damages under age discrimination laws are consistently positive and
larger – indicating a reduction in the callback differential by 3.4 to 3.9 percentage points for men, and 2.7
percentage points for women. The estimates are statistically significant at the 5-percent level for men,
and the 10-percent level for women. In contrast, the estimates for larger damages under disability
discrimination laws are smaller (especially for men) and statistically insignificant.

32
Absent this consideration, one might want to cluster at the level of the resume or the job ad, or use multi-way
clustering. In Neumark et al. (forthcoming) we verified that these alternatives have virtually no effect on the
standard errors.

18

The last two rows of the table report estimates of the effects of the two alternative broader
definitions of disability – the broader medical-only definition, and the definition that adds in the two
states (California and Minnesota) with relatively “intermediate” definitions based on broader definitions
of “limits” than the ADA. The effect of a broader definition can, of course, cut two ways. On the one
hand, it can extend protections and increase hiring. But on the other hand, it could make employers
warier of hiring an older worker who might suffer a health decline and become subject to state disability
discrimination protections – in this case, more easily because of the broader disability definition. The
estimates are always positive, but in two of four cases are quite small (less than 0.01), and only significant
at the 10-percent level for one specification for men – based on the second and more expansive definition
of disability). Thus, we do not view these estimates as providing a clear case of an effect of broader
definitions of disability.
The estimates reported thus far are based on data weighted to make the estimates representative
of retail jobs in the cities in our experiment. We next report estimates of the same models as in Table 5,
using two alternative weighting schemes. We first (Table 6) reweight by the inverse of the proportion of
observations in each city, which, by weighting cities equally, makes the estimates representative of the
cities in our study. We then (Table 7) report simply unweighted estimates, which reflect the over- and
under-sampling of jobs by city discussed earlier. In Tables 6 and 7, the key difference is that the
estimated effects of larger damages under age discrimination laws on the relative callback rate for older
applicants diminishes, and becomes statistically insignificant (while the estimates remain positive). 33 The
estimated effects of larger damages under disability discrimination laws, for women, vary relatively little,
and across Tables 5-7 are in a tight range between vary between 0.017 and 0.022, and are marginally
significant. Finally, across Tables 5-7 there is no evidence of adverse effects of anti-discrimination laws
related to either age or disability on the hiring of older workers.

33

Examination of Figures 1 and 4, and Table 2, provide some suggestive information on why the results are
sensitive to the weighting. For example, Figure 1 shows that Washington is severely downweighted based on the
QWI data. Figure 4 shows that age-related callback differences are relatively small in Washington, especially for
women. And Table 2 shows Washington has larger damages for age discrimination claims. Thus, downweighting
Washington would be expected to strengthen the evidence that larger damages for age discrimination claims reduce
measured age discrimination.

19

Addressing the Heckman Critique
Finally, we turn to estimates that are intended to eliminate the bias identified by the Heckman
critique. To briefly explain the procedure, we first estimate a probit model with the controls and their
interactions with “Old” included. 34 We then test the overidentifying restriction for the controls, to see
whether the data are consistent with the effects for young and old differing in a way that is driven only by
the difference in variance of the unobservables (that is, the ratios of effects for young and old workers are
equal). 35 It turns out that the overidentifying restriction using all of the controls is not rejected by the
data, so we do not have to narrow down the set of variables used to identify the relative variance. We
then estimate a heteroskedastic probit model that imposes equal coefficients of the controls in the latent
variable model, with the variance of the residual differing between young and old workers. The estimates
of this model are used to estimate marginal effects, and – as explained earlier – to decompose the
marginal effects to isolate the effects of the variables on the level of the latent variable, which are the
unbiased estimates of discrimination.
The results are reported in Table 8, using our preferred weighting from Table 5. Results are
shown for women only because, for men, there was no evidence against the homoskedastic model. For
men, the old/young ratio of standard deviations of unobservables was 0.97 (p-value for test that ratio
equals 1 = 0.89) for the first specification corresponding to Table 8, and 0.90 (p-value = 0.56) for the
second specification. In contrast, as the second panel of the table shows, the ratio of the standard
deviation of the unobservable for old relative to young workers for women exceeds 1.2, and is
significantly different from 1 at the 10-percent level, rejecting (at this significance level) the
homoskedastic model – which implies that the Heckman critique applies.
The upper rows of the table report the marginal effects corrected for bias. The specifications are
otherwise the same as those in Table 5, using all the laws simultaneously, and hence can be compared

34

We do not report these results here.
To identify the effect of the old-state law interactions, we have to assume equal coefficients for the state dummy
variables, so this restriction is simply imposed. The overidentification test we use pertains to all of the other
controls.
35

20

directly. The estimates in the first row indicate that the main effects of “Old,” which measure age
discrimination in the states where the federal laws bind, become larger by about 3 to 4 percentage points.
Thus, for these states the evidence of age discrimination against women strengthens.
The remaining rows of the top panel report the unbiased estimates of the marginal effects of the
estimated interactions between “Old” and the features of state anti-discrimination laws. Relative to Table
5, the evidence of positive effects of larger damages under age discrimination laws is no longer present;
these estimates are close to zero and statistically insignificant. However, there is now some statistically
significant evidence of positive effects on the relative callback rate for older women of larger damages
under disability discrimination laws, for the second specification (using the more expansive definition of
disability to define broader laws). There is also one estimate (in column (1)) suggesting that a broader
definition of disability can reduce relative hiring of older workers, but this evidence is generally not
statistically significant, nor was there support for this conclusion in the earlier tables.
Conclusions and Discussion
In this study, we provide evidence from a field experiment – a correspondence study – on age
discrimination in hiring for retail sales jobs. The unique contribution of this paper is to collect
experimental data in all 50 states, and then to relate the measure of age discrimination by state – the
difference in callback rates between old and young applicants – to variation across states in antidiscrimination laws offering protections to older workers that are stronger than the federal laws. We
study both age discrimination and disability discrimination laws. While age discrimination laws
explicitly target discrimination against older workers, we argue that it is also natural to expect disability
discrimination laws to do more to protect older workers than younger workers from labor market
discrimination, and hence to act as a second type of law that reduces age discrimination.
The experimental evidence provides direct estimates of discrimination in hiring – which is the
goal of the correspondence study methods we use in this paper. The findings on age discrimination point
consistently to evidence of hiring discrimination against older men and more so against older women.
The key new evidence in this paper, however, concerns the relationship between hiring

21

discrimination against older workers and state variation in age and disability discrimination laws. On this
question, we find some evidence that stronger laws protecting older workers from discrimination –
providing for larger damages – boost callback rates for older relative to younger job applicants, consistent
with reducing age discrimination in the labor market. In particular, we find some evidence of lower
discrimination against both older men and older women in states where the law allows larger damages in
age discrimination claims, and we find some evidence of lower discrimination against older women in
states where the law allows larger damages in disability discrimination claims. This evidence is not
robust to all of the estimations we report. However, we find this evidence for age discrimination laws, for
both men and women, when we weight the data to make the estimates representative of the universe of
retail jobs in the cities included in our experiment; and we find this evidence for disability discrimination
laws, for women, when we also adjust for potential biases in correspondence study estimates.36
We do not find evidence that features that make state laws broader, covering more older workers,
affect age discrimination in hiring. Specifically, we generally do not find effects of a lower firm-size
cutoff for state age or disability discrimination laws, or for broader definitions of disability under
disability discrimination laws.
Finally, perhaps our strongest conclusion is that we find no consistent evidence indicating that
stronger or broader laws protecting older workers from discrimination deter hiring of older workers. This
evidence contrasts with the argument that these kinds of anti-discrimination protections can have the
direct effect of increasing termination costs, and hence lead to the unintended consequence of deterring
hiring of older workers – whether with regard to age discrimination laws or disability discrimination laws.
A potential limitation of our evidence is that it is based on cross-sectional relationships between
measured discrimination and anti-discrimination laws. This is unavoidable in our context; the laws we
study are long-standing, and our key innovation is to use a correspondence study to obtain direct

36

Given that correspondence studies of labor market discrimination often sample job ads in a manner similar to
what we did in this study, rather than based on more standard sampling of jobs or workers reflected in traditional
secondary data sources, this sensitivity to weighting should be considered in future studies. We do note, though,
that – at least in our study – this sensitivity pertains only to the estimation of the effects of anti-discrimination laws;
the evidence of lower callback rates for older workers is not sensitive to weighting.

22

measures of discrimination against older job applicants. However, our evidence is not at odds with a
good deal of other evidence – generally based on longitudinal variation across states and over time – that
anti-discrimination laws can boost employment of older workers. Past non-experimental work generally
indicates that the adoption of age discrimination laws increased employment rates of older workers,
possibly in part through reducing terminations (Adams, 2004, Neumark and Stock, 1999). And recent
evidence on state age discrimination laws points to a positive effect of allowing larger damages in
boosting employment of workers incentivized to work past age 65 by Social Security reforms in the
2000s (Neumark and Song, 2013). 37 However, Neumark and Button (2014) found that during the Great
Recession stronger age discrimination laws may have hurt older workers, perhaps because in a period of
highly uncertain future labor demand the potentially higher termination costs for older workers became a
first-order concern to employers. 38
The non-experimental evidence on disability discrimination laws is less clear, with some studies
finding negative effects on employment (DeLeire 2000; Acemoglu and Angrist, 2001; Jolls and Prescott,
2004; Bell and Heitmueller, 2009), and some finding no effects (Houtenville and Burkhauser, 2004;
Hotchkiss, 2004; Stock and Beegle, 2004). However, among more recent studies, the evidence generally
points to positive effects (Kruse and Schur, 2003; Button, 2018; Armour, Button, and Hollands, 2018), as
does one experimental study (Ameri et al., 2018). Our analysis is more consistent with the studies finding
either no effect or a positive effect of disability discrimination laws.
In our view, our findings using a direct measure of discrimination against older workers, coupled
with much of the non-experimental evidence on age discrimination laws and a good deal of the recent
non-experimental evidence on disability discrimination laws, bolsters the empirical case against the idea
that discrimination protections have the unintended consequence of deterring hiring of protected groups –
at least with respect to older workers. Although our results do not provide clear and compelling evidence
that these anti-discrimination laws provide benefits to older workers, we find some evidence in this

37

The non-experimental evidence in Neumark and Song (2013) also suggests beneficial effects of extending age
discrimination protections to smaller firms.
38
The data for our experiment were collected in 2016, well into the expansion that followed the Great Recession.

23

direction, and hence conclude that it is more likely than not that these laws are beneficial to older
workers. Finally, whereas our experimental analysis provides some evidence of direct reductions in
discrimination in hiring, the non-experimental evidence indicates there may be other advantages in terms
of increased employment and fewer terminations.

Notes: State laws are as of 2016. Age discrimination laws are from Neumark and Song (2013) and disability discrimination laws are
from Neumark et al. (2017), but both are updated to 2016. For Maryland, under Minimum firm size, we list the value 1. This is the case
for Baltimore County, from which our data come; the minimum is 15 for the rest of the state. For the states listed as “Yes” under Larger
damages than ADA, but not uncapped, details are as follows: Alaska – uncapped compensatory damages, punitive damages capped
above ADA levels; Maine – exceeds ADA cap for firms of 201+ employees. As discussed more in-depth in our legal appendix, for
Connecticut the evidence favors punitive damages not being available, and compensatory damages were definitely not available.

Notes: For each city, the observations are weighted by the ratio of QWI Retail Employment, by sex, to the number of
observations in the sample. The p-values reported for F-statistics for weighted tests of independence. There were no positive
responses for West Virginia, so it drops out of the probit analysis in subsequent tables. We therefore also drop West Virginia
from this table to have results for the same sample; this has virtually no impact on the estimates in this table. We also drop the
very small number of observations for Arkansas, South Dakota, and Wyoming.

Notes: For each city, the observations are weighted by the ratio of QWI Retail Employment, by sex, to the number of
observations in the sample. The overidentification test is based on interactions of the skill variables, order of application,
and unemployment, with the dummy variable for old. See notes to Tables 3 and 4. Results are shown for women only.
For men, there was no evidence against the homoskedastic model. The old/young ratio of standard deviations of
unobservables was 0.97 (p-value = 0.89) for specification 1, and 0.90 (p-value = 0.56) for specification 2.

Coding of State Laws
To study the effects of disability discrimination laws, we first needed to code up these laws. To do this,
we followed the procedure developed in Neumark and Song (2013) to code state age discrimination laws.
This required extensive background research on state statutes and their histories, culled from legal
databases including Lexis-Nexis, Westlaw, and Hein Online, as well as many other sources. The first step
in assembling information on state disability discrimination laws was to identify the appropriate state
statute, which can be complicated because the disability discrimination law can be listed under various
sections of state law (e.g., a fair employment act, a separate disability discrimination act). After the
appropriate statute was identified, we traced the history of the statute using the legal databases to look for
changes over time. In some cases, we had to look beyond the statutes to information from state agencies,
case law, or other sources.
Because it is complicated to read and interpret the law correctly based solely on statutes, we crosschecked our understanding of the statute with other legal references or treatises and additional sources of
information on state laws. 39 The other sources were also useful because of a further challenge in reading
statutes. In particular, one section may define what a discriminatory act is, while other provisions may be
delegated to the Civil Rights Commission, or the remedies may be listed under a different section of the
statute.
To minimize inaccuracies, once all the necessary information was obtained from these sources, we
attempted to compare and validate it using other sources. If information obtained from different sources
matched, we were confident that the information was correct. In cases of what should be unambiguous
information – in particular the minimum firm size for laws to apply – we use the information from the
statute regardless. However, in cases of information that can be more easily misinterpreted from the
statute, when we found discrepancies we turned to state agencies or other sources for corroborating
information. We also examined case law, using the legal databases, to see if rulings established fixed
features of the state laws that were not specified in the statute, such as damages allowed.
As a result of these efforts, we were able to fill in all the information on these laws for our sample period.
The only possible exception is for damages. In particular, if our information on damages came not from
statutes (since the statutes did not mention damages) but rather from case law or other sources, then we
did not necessarily have an explicit “reading” on these damages in every year. But since our other
sources cover many years, the only variation we could miss was some short-term change between the
level of damages we get from other sources. We assume, though, that there is little or no such variation.
As noted in the main text, there are three major ways in which state disability discrimination laws can be
stronger than the federal ADA. Here we provide some general discussion of these differences, and then
we provide state-specific details.
The minimum firm size for the ADA to apply is 15. We create an indicator variable equal to one if the
firm size minimum is lower than 10 (i.e., substantially lower than the ADA minimum), and zero
otherwise. When the firm size minimum is lower, more workers (and employers) are covered.
Defining disability is of course more complicated than defining other protected groups, like age, race, and
sex, and the definition of disability differs across states. Most states adopt the same definition as the
ADA, either explicitly or via case law. The ADA provides three routes for an individual to be considered
39

These included Beegle and Stock (2003), Buckley and Green (2011, 2009, 2008, 2006, 2002, 1997), Colker and
Milani (2002), DRI (2011), Green (1992), Long (2004), Perry (2011), and a 50-state survey of discrimination laws
at http://www.navexglobal.com/sites/default/files/uploads/lb_Descrimination-50States.pdf (viewed September 22,
2014).

disabled:
“The term “disability” means, with respect to an individual(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such
individual;
(B) a record of such an impairment; or
(C) being regarded as having such an impairment” (42 U.S. Code §12102 (1)).
Given that the definition of physical and mental impairment is quite broad, the “substantially limits”
requirement can probably be thought of as the main criterion defining disability under the ADA and
similar state laws. Moreover, the “substantially limits” phrase has been interpreted by the courts as quite
restrictive 40. The U.S. Supreme Court, in the “Sutton Trilogy” of cases (Sutton v. United Airlines (119 S.
Ct. 2139 (1999)), Murphy v. United Parcel Service, Inc. (119 S. Ct. 2133 (1999)), and Albertson's, Inc. v.
Kirkingburg (119 S. Ct. 2162 (1999))), deemed individuals to be not disabled if mitigating measures, such
as glasses or medication, made the limiting features of the disability dormant. A U.S. Court of Appeals,
4th Circuit, decision also restricted episodic conditions, such as epilepsy, from being considered a
disability in EEOC v. Sara Lee Corp., 237 F.3d 349 (4th Cir., 2001). 41
Some states use a weaker criterion in this regard than the “substantially limits” requirement of the ADA
under the first criterion above. In two states this is done by the statutes substituting “materially limits”
(MN) or just “limits” (CA) for “substantially limits,” with legal interpretations or statutes being explicit
that this is a less stringent standard. Several states (CT, IL, NJ, NY, and WA) adopt an even laxer
definition, considering an individual to be disabled if their impairment is medically diagnosed, regardless
of whether the impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities. Long (2004) argues, as
seems quite reasonable, that these medical definitions broaden coverage relative to the ADA. To capture
this variation, we create two dichotomous variables called “broader disability definition.” The first is a
dummy variable for states with the medical definition of disability (“broader disability definition (medical
only)”), and the second is a dummy variable that also captures states with the “limits” (CA) definition, or
the “materially limits” (MN) definition (“broader disability definition (medical or limits)”).
Damages are likely to play a major role in the strength of discrimination laws, based in part on evidence
from age discrimination laws (Neumark and Song, 2013). The ADA caps the sum of compensatory and
punitive damages per claimant based on firm size, as follows:
1.

15-100 employees:

$50,000

2.

101-200 employees: $100,000

3.

201-500 employees: $200,000

4.

500 plus employees: $300,000.

Few states follow this exact schedule (AR, CO, DE, MD, SC, and TX). 12 states allow larger potential
damages, either through higher caps (AK and ME) or, more commonly, through allowing compensatory
damages and uncapped punitive damages (CA, HI, MA, MO, NJ, OH, OR, RI, VT, and WV). We create
a dichotomous variable called “larger damages,” which equals one for the 12 states where potential
40

For example, Burgdorf (1997, p. 536-538) cites numerous cases stemming from numerous cases stemming from
Forrisi v. Bowen, 794 F.2d 931, 934 (4th Cir. 1986), which interpreted the ADA to only cover the “truly disabled”
and not those with more minor impairments.
41
These decisions were reversed by the ADA Amendments Act (ADAAA), effective in 2009, which is beyond our
sample period. Under the ADAAA, states where the ADA’s definition of disability prevailed became more like
those states using a medical impairment definition, discussed next. In principle we could use data pre- and post2009 for identifying information on this dimension of variation in disability discrimination laws, but the
confounding effects of the Great Recession make this unlikely to be informative.

ii

damages exceed those under the ADA, and zero otherwise. Three states (FL, ID, and MN) have lower
damage caps than the ADA, and two states (AL and MS) have no law (in which case we code the state as
not having the stronger provision). There are 26 states with no punitive damages. We do not include
these states in the larger damages category because compensatory damages require documentation and, in
many cases, seem unlikely to be as large; an example might be medical bills if an employee was
terminated unjustly, and dropped from a health insurance plan. Thus, punitive damages are likely more
the driver of large judgments. 42,43
The coding of the state age and disability discrimination laws is summarized in Table 2 in the main text.
Appendix Table A1 lists the year of adoption of these laws.
Definition of Disability
Some state laws bypass the requirement that a mental or physical impairment “substantially limits” one or
more major life activities. This occurs either by replacing “substantially limits” with either just “limits”
(California) or “materially limits” (Minnesota), or by defining disability as a medical diagnosis
(Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Washington effective May 4, 2007). These state laws are
discussed in more detail below.
California
California’s disability discrimination law is discussed in further detail by Button (2018), but we provide a
summary here. California adopts a similar definition of disability to the ADA but specifies in statute that
the impairment must “limit” instead of “substantially limit” a major life activity. Although dropping the
word “substantially” may seem trivial, this did in fact make establishing that a disability exists less
burdensome, but not initially. The Prudence Kay Poppink Act took effect in California in 2001, and this
act made it explicit that the “limits” requirement in California was less burdensome than the federal ADA.
Before this act passed however, the “limits” requirement was interpreted in the same way as the federal
ADA (Long, 2004). For example, in Colmenares v. Braemer Country Club, Inc., 63 P.3d 220, 223 (Cal.
2003), the plaintiff was deemed not disabled because his case preceded the Poppink Act, when
California’s “limits” was interpreted the same as the ADA’s “substantially limits.”
Connecticut
In Connecticut, a diagnosis of a physical or mental impairment makes the individual disabled under law,
42

For reasons explained below, some of our analyses incorporate information on two features of state age
discrimination laws – larger damages, and the firm-size cut-off – in some of our analyses. This information (from
Neumark and Song, 2013) is listed in the last two columns of Table 1. As the table shows, firm-size minimums are
similar for disability and age discrimination laws, but there are 11 states that have a different minimum (AL, AR,
GA, IL, IN, KY, LA, NE, OR, SD, and VA). With regard to damages, we focus on whether compensatory or
punitive damages are allowed, which they are not under federal age discrimination law (the ADEA). Some states
require proof of intent to discriminate in order for compensatory or punitive damages to be awarded, whereas others
require “willful” violation. Because the federal law allows additional liquidated, non-punitive damages (double
back pay and benefits) when there is “willful” violation, the question of whether the state requires intent or willful
violation may seem to be potentially relevant in deciding whether a state law offers greater protection. However,
willful violation is a much stricter standard than intent (Moberly, 1994). Moreover, compensatory or punitive
damages are almost certainly greater than liquidated damages, and they can be much greater. As a consequence, a
state law that provides compensatory or punitive damages, whether or not this requires proof of intent or willful
violation, clearly entails stronger remedies than the federal law, so our classification captures whether either is
allowed.
43
In principle one might classify states with combinations of the three dimensions of laws tabulated in Table 2 as
having the strongest laws. However, this would provide virtually no difference in variation, and hence almost no
additional variation. As Table 2 shows, the set of states with the broader definition is quite small, and only one state
(New Jersey) overlaps this dimension of state laws with larger damages. Similarly, for the overlap between broader
definition and smaller firm size, no states differ. And finally, if we look at the overlap between larger damages and
smaller firm size, only one state with larger damages leaves its firm size cutoff at 10 or greater (West Virginia); the
independent variation in firm size cutoffs comes from the states that do not have larger damages.

iii

bypassing the “substantially limits” requirement. CONN. GEN. STAT. § 46a-51(15). states that
“‘Physically disabled’ refers to any individual who has any chronic physical handicap, infirmity or
impairment, whether congenital or resulting from bodily injury, organic processes or changes or from
illness, including, but not limited to, epilepsy, deafness or hearing impairment or reliance on a wheelchair
or other remedial appliance or device.”
Connecticut is even more explicit in its definition of mental disability (Long, 2004), as CONN. GEN.
STAT. § 46a-51(20) states that “‘Mental disability’ refers to an individual who has a record of, or is
regarded as having one or more mental disorders, as defined in the most recent edition of the American
Psychiatric Association's ‘Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders’.”
Illinois
775 ILL. COMP. STAT. 5/1-103(I) defines a disability as “…a determinable physical or mental
characteristic of a person, including, but not limited to, a determinable physical characteristic which
necessitates the person's use of a guide, hearing or support dog, the history of such characteristic, or the
perception of such characteristic by the person complained against, which may result from disease, injury,
congenital condition of birth or functional disorder…”
Minnesota
Similar to California, MINN. STAT. § 363.01(12) defines disability as “…any condition or characteristic
that renders a person a disabled person. A disabled person is any person who (1) has a physical, sensory,
or mental impairment which materially limits one or more major life activities; (2) has a record of such an
impairment; or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment.” While the distinction between materially
and substantially may seem trivial, Long (2004) notes that the Minnesota Supreme Court, in Sigurdson v.
Carl Bolander & Sons, Co., 532 N.W.2d 225, 228 n.3 (Minn. 1995), stated that the Minnesota definition
is less stringent.
New Jersey
N.J. STAT. ANN. § 10:5-5(q) defines disability as a “…physical disability, infirmity, malformation or
disfigurement which is caused by bodily injury, birth defect or illness including epilepsy and other seizure
disorders, and which shall include, but not be limited to, any degree of paralysis, amputation, lack of
physical coordination, blindness or visual impediment, deafness or hearing impediment, muteness or
speech impediment or physical reliance on a service or guide dog, wheelchair, or other remedial appliance
or device, or any mental, psychological or developmental disability, including autism spectrum disorders,
resulting from anatomical, psychological, physiological or neurological conditions which prevents the
normal exercise of any bodily or mental functions or is demonstrable, medically or psychologically, by
accepted clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques. Disability shall also mean AIDS or HIV infection.”
New York
New York's Executive Law § 292(21)(a) defines a disability as “a physical, mental or medical impairment
resulting from anatomical, physiological, genetic or neurological conditions which prevents the exercise
of a normal bodily function or is demonstrable by medically accepted clinical or laboratory diagnostic
techniques.” The requirement that the impairment be “demonstrable by medically accepted clinical or
laboratory diagnostic techniques” bypasses the “substantially limits” requirement and makes New York
disability discrimination law more broadly applicable (Long, 2004).
Washington
Washington’s definition of disability was rather vague before an amendment, effective May 4, 2007,
changed Washington’s definition to follow a medical diagnosis definition like Connecticut, Illinois, New
Jersey, and New York. Prior to this amendment, WASH. REV. CODE § 49.60.180 prohibited
discrimination on the basis of physical disability, but the term was not defined. Noting this, Long (2004)
could not categorize Washington’s laws and instead put them in a “miscellaneous” category. It appears
that Washington’s lack of definition caused courts to rely on the federal definition of disability, which
iv

included the “substantially limits” requirement. 44 After the 2007 amendment, Washington law states that
“ ‘Disability’ means the presence of a sensory, mental, or physical impairment that:
(i) Is medically cognizable or diagnosable; or
(ii) Exists as a record or history; or
(iii) Is perceived to exist whether or not it exists in fact” (Wash. Rev. Code § 49.60.040 (7)(a)).
Compensatory and Punitive Damages
As discussed in the main text, we classify 12 states as having damages that exceed those provided by the
ADA. Of these 12 larger damages states, two states (AK and ME) have caps on either compensatory or
on punitive damages, but these caps exceed those of the ADA caps on the sum of compensatory and
punitive damages. The remaining ten states (CA, HI, MA, MO, NJ, OH, OR, RI, VT, and WV) allow
compensatory damages and allow punitive damages that are uncapped. Of the 38 states that we classify
as not having damages that exceed the ADA, six states (AR, CO, DE, MD, SC, and TX) have the exact
same damage caps as the ADA, three (FL, ID, MN) have lower damage caps, 26 do not allow punitive
damages (AZ, GA, IA, IL, IN, KS, KY, LA, MI, MT, NC, ND, NE, NH, NM, NV, NY, OK, PA, SD, TN,
UT, VA, WA, WI, and WY), two (AL, MS) do not have an employment non-discrimination law for
disability, and CT had an ambiguous law at the time of data collection, such that we code it is not having
larger damages since this category is a much better fit.
States with Compensatory Damages and Uncapped Punitive Damages
Ten states (CA, HI, MA, MO, NJ, OH, OR, RI, VT, and WV) offer both compensatory damages and
uncapped punitive damages. Determining that these damages were in fact uncapped was difficult. For all
these states, statutes did not mention explicit caps on damages, nor was there explicit mention that
damages were uncapped. While it seemed likely that these states allowed uncapped damages, we
confirmed this conjecture with various sources.
California
California’s employment non-discrimination law is vague as to what damages are available, and this had
to be clarified in case law. The Fair Employment and Housing Act (Cal. Govt. Code §§12900–12996)
provides no mention of statutory caps on civil damages. The case Commodore Home Sys., Inc. v.
Superior Court, 32 Cal. 3d 211, 221 (1982) concluded that allowable damages fell under Cal. Civ. Code,
§ 3294, which provides no caps. 45 The National Conference of State Legislatures (2015) (henceforth
NCSL) also indicates that punitive damages are available.
Hawaii
Hawaii’s employment non-discrimination law states that compensatory and punitive damages are
available, but no caps, or lack thereof, are explicitly mentioned (HI ST § 378-5, HI ST § 368-17). DRI
(2011, p. 97) and NCSL (2015) confirm that there are in fact no caps. Jury instructions mention punitive
damages but do not mention caps. 46 Punitive damages are discussed in-depth by Antolini (2004) who
notes that punitive damages are not capped (p. 159).
Massachusetts
Massachusetts’ employment non-discrimination law states that compensatory and punitive damages are
available, but no caps, or lack thereof, are explicitly mentioned (MA ST 151B). These damages can only
be obtained from trial court and not through the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination
(DRI, 2011, p. 191; Sperino, 2010). NCSL (2015) and Guide to Employment Law & Regulation (2016)

v

(henceforth GELR) also indicates that punitive damages are available.
Missouri
Missouri’s employment non-discrimination law states that compensatory and punitive damages are
available, but no caps, or lack thereof, are explicitly mentioned (MO ST 213). According to case law
mentioned by DRI (2011, p. 223) “…the Missouri Courts of Appeals have indicated that, in most
situations, the courts should not allow punitive damages in excess of a single digit ratio to actual
damages. State ex rel. Bass Pro Outdoor World, LLC v. Schneider, 302 S.W.3d 103 (Mo. App. 2009).
At least one court has held, however, that in appropriate circumstances a punitive damage award could
significantly exceed a single digit ratio. Lynn v. TNT Logistics North America, Inc., 275 S.W.3d 304
(Mo. App. 2008)” Sperino (2010, p. 709), NCSL (2015), and GELR (2016) also indicate that punitive
damages are uncapped.
New Jersey
New Jersey’s employment non-discrimination law states that “All remedies available in common law tort
actions shall be available to prevailing plaintiffs” (N.J.S.A. 10:5-13). This includes compensatory and
punitive damages (DRI, 2011, p. 254) but there is no explicit mention of caps, or lack thereof. Case law,
such as Baker v. National State Bank, 801 A.2d 1158 (N.J. App. Div. 2002) indicates that these damages
are uncapped (DRI, 2011, p. 253). NCSL (2015) and GELR (2016) also indicate that punitive damages
are available.
Ohio
Ohio law allows for “…damages, injunctive relief, or any other appropriate relief.” (OH ST. § 4112.99).
According to DRI (2011, p. 311), this includes uncapped compensatory and punitive damages for civil
actions, but these damages are capped if the case is handled by the Ohio Civil Rights Commission. NCSL
(2015) also indicates that punitive damages are available.
Oregon
Oregon’s employment non-discrimination law states: “The court may award, in addition to the relief
authorized under subsection (1) of this section, compensatory damages or $200, whichever is greater, and
punitive damages…” (OR ST § 659A.885(3)(a)). DRI (2011, p. 326) confirms that damages are
uncapped, noting that there are caps only if the action is against a government entity. NCSL (2015) and
GELR (2016) also indicate that punitive damages are available.
Rhode Island
Rhode Island’s employment non-discrimination law states that: “Any person with a disability who is the
victim of discrimination prohibited by this chapter may bring an action in the Superior Court against the
person or entity causing the discrimination for equitable relief, compensatory and/or punitive damages or
for any other relief that the court deems appropriate” (RI ST § 42-87-4). NCSL (2015) and GELR (2016)
confirm that punitive damages are available for a private action. DRI (2011, p. 352) confirms that there
are no caps, but notes that judges may intervene in cases when juries wish to award punitive damages that
are deemed excessive, as in Mazzaroppi v. Tocco, 533 A.2d 203 (R.I. 1987).
Vermont
Vermont’s employment non-discrimination law states that: “Any person aggrieved by a violation of the
provisions of this subchapter may bring an action in superior court seeking compensatory and punitive
damages or equitable relief, including restraint of prohibited acts, restitution of wages or other benefits,
reinstatement, costs, reasonable attorney's fees and other appropriate relief” (21 V.S.A. §495b). DRI
(2011, p. 399) interprets this to mean that both compensatory and punitive damages are uncapped. NCSL
(2015) similarly confirms that punitive damages are available. The language “compensatory and punitive
damages” was added by 1999, No. 19, § 5. Before this, the statute just said “damages” and it was left
ambiguous as to if punitive damages were covered. This ambiguity prior to the 1999 amendment was

vi

settled in Fernot v. Crafts Inn, Inc., 895 F. Supp. 668, 682 (D. Vt. 1995), where it was deemed that
punitive damages were not allowed.
West Virginia
West Virginia’s employment non-discrimination law does not directly state that compensatory and
punitive damages are available. It states that remedies include: “…reinstatement or hiring of employees,
granting of back pay or any other legal or equitable relief as the court deems appropriate. In actions
brought under this section, the court in its discretion may award all or a portion of the costs of litigation,
including reasonable attorney fees and witness fees, to the complainant” (W. Va. Code §5-11-13). DRI
(2011, p. 428) deems punitive damages to be available, citing Haynes v. Rhone-Poulenc, Inc.,521 S.E.2d
331 (W. Va. 1999) as an example. The question of if compensatory damages were available was settled in
State Human Rights Commission v. Pauley, 212 S.E.2d 77 (W. Va. 1975), where the West Virginia
Supreme Court deemed compensatory damages to be available. NCSL (2015) lists both compensatory and
punitive damages.
States with Caps that Exceed the ADA
Alaska
Alaska’s damages, as described in AS § 09.17.020(h), exceed those of the ADA for all firm sizes:
“(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in an action against an employer to recover damages for
an unlawful employment practice prohibited by AS 18.80.220, the amount of punitive damages awarded
by the court or jury may not exceed
(1) $200,000 if the employer has less than 100 employees in this state;
(2) $300,000 if the employer has 100 or more but less than 200 employees in this state;
(3) $400,000 if the employer has 200 or more but less than 500 employees in this state; and
(4) $500,000 if the employer has 500 or more employees in this state.”
These caps are just caps on punitive damages, and these caps are even above the ADA caps which are
caps on the sum of compensatory and punitive damages. NCSL (2015) lists that compensatory and
punitive damages are available.
Maine
Maine’s compensatory damages, as described in 5 M.R.S.A. §4613(2)(B)(8)(e), exceed those of the
combined damages allowed under the ADA for firms with 201 or more employees, and are equal for all
other firm sizes.
“(e) The sum of compensatory damages awarded under this subparagraph for future pecuniary losses,
emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, other nonpecuniary
losses and the amount of punitive damages awarded under this section may not exceed for each
complaining party:
(i) In the case of a respondent who has more than 14 and fewer than 101 employees in each of 20 or more
calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year, $50,000;
(ii) In the case of a respondent who has more than 100 and fewer than 201 employees in each of 20 or
more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year, $100,000;
(iii) In the case of a respondent who has more than 200 and fewer than 501 employees in each of 20 or
more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year, $300,000; and
(iv) In the case of a respondent who has more than 500 employees in each of 20 or more calendar weeks
in the current or preceding calendar year, $500,000.”
The statute also allows for punitive damages “A complaining party may recover punitive damages under
vii

this subparagraph against a respondent if the complaining party demonstrates that the respondent engaged
in a discriminatory practice or discriminatory practices with malice or with reckless indifference to the
rights of an aggrieved individual protected by this Act.” (5 M.R.S.A. §4613(2)(B)(8)(c)) This is
confirmed both by DRI (2011, p. 170) and NCSL (2015).
States with the Same Damage Caps as the ADA
Arkansas
The Arkansas Civil Rights Act (Ark. Code Ann. §§16-123-101 et seq.) specifies the same damage caps as
the ADA (§§16-123-107(c)(2)(A)). However, since firms of size nine to 14 are also covered under this
law, the damage cap for this group is set at $15,000.
Colorado
The Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act (C.R.S. §§24-34-301 et seq.) allows both compensatory and
punitive damages, but explicitly mentions that they are capped at ADA levels (see 42 U.S.C. sec.
1981a(b)(3)). Since the firm size minimum is one, damage caps are $10,000 for one to four employees,
and $25,000 for five to 14 employees (C.R.S. §§24-34-405(d)).
Delaware
The Delaware Discrimination in Employment Act (19 Del. C. §711 et seq.) specifies that damages are
capped at the same level as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which are the same damage caps
that apply to the ADA.
Maryland
The Maryland Fair Employment Practices Act (Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t §20–601 et seq.) provides for
the same damage caps as the ADA (Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t §20–1009(3)). Prior to the passage of
Acts 2007, c. 176, however, the Maryland Fair Employment Practices Act did not allow punitive
damages. The statute allows for a minimum employer size of one for the law to apply in Baltimore
County, but punitive damages are not allowed in Baltimore County in cases with employers of size one to
14 employees.
South Carolina
The South Carolina Human Affairs Law (S.C. Code §§1-13-10 et seq.) does not explicitly mention
compensatory or punitive damages. DRI (2011, p. 363) argues that the damages are identical to those
under Title VII / ADA cases, noting case law which states: “Thus, Title VII cases which interpret
provisions or procedures essentially identical to those of the Human Affairs Law are certainly persuasive
if not controlling in construing the Human Affairs Laws (Orr v. Clyburn, 290 S.E.2d 804 (S.C. 1982)).”
Texas
The Texas Commission on Human Rights Act (Tex. Lab. Code §§21.001 et seq.) lists the same damage
caps as the ADA.
States with Lower Damage Caps than the ADA
Florida
The Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992 (Fla. Stat. §§760.01 et seq.) allows uncapped compensatory
damages, but it caps punitive damages at $100,000 (Fla. Stat. §§760.11(5)).
Idaho
Idaho allows “actual damages,” and the statute does not mention caps, or a lack thereof (Idaho Code §675908(c)). Secondary sources were uninformative as to if this meant that actual damages were uncapped
(DRI, 2011, p. 105; Green 1992; Buckley and Green 1997, 2002, 2006, 2008, 2009, and 2011). However,
punitive damages are capped at $1,000 per willful violation (Idaho Code §67-5908(e)).

viii

Minnesota
The Minnesota Human Rights Act (Minn. Stat. §363A) allows for compensatory damages capped at three
times actual damages and punitive damages capped at $25,000 (Minn. Stat. §363A.29 Subd.4(a)).
States that Do Not Allow Punitive Damages
Arizona
Arizona’s employment non-discrimination law does not mention compensatory or punitive damages, only
mentioning non-monetary remedies, back pay, and that there is available “… any other equitable relief as
the court deems appropriate” (A.R.S. §41-1481(G)). The history preamble to H.B. 2319 (Ariz. 45th
legislature, 2001), an unpassed bill that attempted to amend this law, states that “Under Arizona law, the
Attorney General’s Civil Rights Division may only seek relief on behalf of a victim of discrimination in
the name of the aggrieved party. Compensatory and punitive damages are not currently available to an
aggrieved party under Arizona employment law, although under Arizona’s housing law an aggrieved
party may be awarded compensatory and punitive damages, and under the Arizonans with Disabilities
Act, compensatory damages.” This suggests that compensatory and punitive damages are in fact not
available. DRI (2011) and GERL (2015) do not mention punitive damages, with DRI (2011) mentioning
that “A successful plaintiff under the ACRA may recover damages similar to those available under Title
VII prior to it being amended by the 1991 Civil Rights Act.” (p. 13) Before the 1991 Civil Rights Act,
punitive damages were not available.
Georgia
O.C.G.A. §45-19-38(d) states that “Any monetary award ordered pursuant to this article shall be for
actual damages only.” This rules out punitive damages, which is echoed by DRI (2011, p. 88) and NCSL
(2015). GELR (2016) also does not mention punitive damages.
Illinois
The statute allows for “actual damages, as reasonably determined by the Commission, for injury or loss
suffered by the complainant” (775 ILCS 5/8A-104). No punitive damages are mentioned. Smith,
O’Callaghan, and White 47 and DRI (2011, p. 111) state that in the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS
5/1-101 et seq.), punitive damages are not allowed but the actual damages allowed are uncapped. Sezer
and Epting (2012) also state that punitive damages are not allowed. GELR (2016) also does not list
punitive damages. Although this law was amended in 2007 to allow a private right of action, this did not
change the available remedies. However, NCSL (2015) lists punitive damages as being available, so there
is some contradiction in the secondary sources. Given this, case law could help resolve this uncertainty.
Case law confirms the lack of punitive damages, with the Illinois Supreme Court striking a punitive
damages award in Crittenden v. Cook County Commission on Human Rights, 2013 IL 114876 on June 20,
2013. While punitive damages may have been unclear before this case, it is clear since then that they are
not allowed.
Indiana
The Indiana Civil Rights Law (Ind. Code §22-9-1-1, et seq.) does not mention compensatory or punitive
damages. Case law clarified that the Indiana Civil Rights Commission (ICRC) is authorized to award
damages to compensate for both economic and emotional distress losses but is not authorized to award
punitive damages. See Indiana Civil Rights Com'n v. Alder, 1999, 714 N.E.2d 632 (referenced by
Westlaw, 2013b, p. 39 and p. 67). NCSL (2015) also indicates that punitive damages are not available,
DRI (2011, p. 121) does not mention punitive damages, and GELR (2016) does not mention damages as
being available.
Iowa

ix

Case law indicates that punitive damages are not allowed under Iowa’s employment non-discrimination
law, but compensatory damages are allowed and are uncapped. Case law notes via WestLaw (2013a, p.
156) for IA ST § 216.6 states: “Whereas Title VII places cap on compensatory and punitive damages
recoverable by plaintiff who prevails on sex discrimination claims, the Iowa Civil Rights Act (ICRA)
allows no punitive damages, but does not place cap on amount of compensatory damages. Baker v. John
Morrell & Co., N.D.Iowa2003, 266 F.Supp.2d 909, affirmed 382 F.3d 816, rehearing and rehearing en
banc denied.” Other case law supports a lack of punitive damages: City of Hampton v Iowa Civil Rights
Comm’n, 554 N.W.2d (referenced by DRI, 2011, p. 131), Ewing v. Federal Home Loan Bank of Des
Moines, S.D.Iowa2009, 645 F.Supp.2d 707, Pospisil v. O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., N.D.Iowa2007, 619
F.Supp.2d 614, and Faust v. Command Center, Inc., S.D.Iowa2007, 484 F.Supp.2d 953, 100 Fair
Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 1238. Civil Rights (all three also mentioned in Westlaw, 2013a). NCSL (2015)
and GELR (2016) also do not list punitive damages.
Kansas
The Kansas Act Against Discrimination (K.S.A. §44-1001, et seq.) caps damages at $2,000 and does not
list punitive damages. DRI (2011, p. 139), citing Labra v. Mid-Plains Constr., Inc., 32 Kan. App. 2d 821,
823, 90 P.3d 954 (2004), notes that it is unclear if this cap applies only to administrative proceedings or if
it also applies to private actions. Neither DRI (2011) not GELR (2016) nor NCSL (2015) indicate that
punitive damages are available.
Kentucky
Kentucky allows for compensatory damages (K.R.S. §344.230 (3); K.R.S. §344.450). No caps are
mentioned in statute and other sources do not mention caps except to confirm that caps are not codified in
statute (DRI 2011, p. 153; Buckley and Green 1997, 2002, 2006, 2008, 2009, and 2011; Green 1992).
The availability of punitive damages was unclear until the Kentucky Supreme Court investigated this in
2003 and 2004. DRI (2011, p. 154) notes that: “The Kentucky Supreme Court recently clarified, in
contrast to earlier decisions, that punitive damages are not available under the KCRA statutes. Kentucky
Dep’t of Corrs. v. McCullough, 123 S.W.3d 130, 138–39 (Ky. 2003); Brooks v. Lexington-Fayette Urban
County Hous. Auth., 132 S.W.3d 790 (Ky. 2004).” Neither NCSL (2015) nor GELR (2016) list punitive
damages.
Louisiana
Louisiana allows compensatory damages, and the statute mentions no caps (La. R.S. §23:303(A)). DRI
(2011, p. 160) also states that there are no caps. Punitive damages are not available, as DRI (2011, p. 160)
notes that “… punitive damages are not available under Louisiana law unless expressly authorized by
statute. See, e.g., Ross v. Conoco, Inc., 2002-0299 (La. 10/15/02); 828 So. 2d 546, 555.” (This case also
cites Richard v. State, 390 So. 2d 882 (La. 1980); Killebrew v. Abbott Labs., 359 So. 2d 1275 (La. 1978)
on this point). NCSL (2015) and GELR (2016) also do not mention that punitive damages are available.
Michigan
The Michigan’s Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights Act (M.CL. §§37.1101 et seq.) is not explicit about
compensatory and punitive damages, stating that: “… ‘damages’ means damages for injury or loss caused
by each violation of this act, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.” (M.CL. §§37.1606(3)) DRI (2011, p.
201) states that while compensatory damages are allowed and uncapped, punitive damages (exemplary
damages) are not allowed. The lack of punitive damages is confirmed in Dorsey v City of Detroit, 157 F
Supp 2d 729 (ED Mich 2001). NCSL (2015) and GELR (2016) also list punitive damages.

Montana
The Montana Human Rights Act does not explicitly mention compensatory damages. DRI (2011, p. 229)
and Perry (2011) both state that compensatory damages are allowed and uncapped. However, punitive

x

damages are not allowed for employment discrimination and this is noted explicitly in statute (Mont.
Code Ann. §§49-2-506(2)). The lack of punitive damages is also noted by NCSL (2015) and GELR
(2016) does not list punitive damages.
Nebraska
The Nebraska Fair Employment Practice Act (Neb. Rev. Stat. §§48-1101 et seq.) does not explicitly
indicate if compensatory or punitive damages are available. Gradwohl (1995) provides an in-depth
discussion of punitive damages in Nebraska and both Gradwohl (1995) and DRI (2011, p. 235) state that
punitive damages are generally unavailable in Nebraska. Other secondary sources suggest the lack of
punitive damages in Nebraska for employment discrimination (NCSL, 2015; GELR, 2016) 48.
Nevada
The section of the statute detailing employment non-discrimination law does not discuss damages (Nev.
Rev. Stat. §613.330 et seq.) Nev. Rev. Stat. §233.170 which lists the powers of the Nevada Equal Rights
Commission only mentions “actual damages for any economic loss and no more.” No secondary sources
suggest that punitive damages are available (Green 1992; Buckley and Green 1997, 2002, 2006, 2008,
2009, and 2011; NCSL, 2015; GELR, 2016).
New Hampshire
According to New Hampshire’s employment non-discrimination law, compensatory damages are
available (N.H. R.S.A. 354A-21(d)). Punitive damages are not mentioned in this statute, but a more
general statute on punitive damages states: “No punitive damages shall be awarded in any action, unless
otherwise provided by statute.” (N.H. R.S.A. 507:16) DRI (2011, p. 247) and NCSL (2015) also state that
New Hampshire law does not allow punitive damages, and GELR (2016) lists compensatory damages
only. Case law appears to indicate that punitive damages are not available 49.
New Mexico
The New Mexico Human Rights Act provides for “actual damages” with no caps mentioned (NMSA
§§28-1-11-E). DRI (2011, p. 265) indicates that this mean that there are uncapped compensatory
damages. 50 Punitive damages, however, are not available: “The NMHRA provides that an employee may
recover actual damages and reasonable attorneys’ fees. NMSA 1978, §§28-1-11(E), 28-1-13(D). This
has been interpreted to be confined to compensatory damages. See Trujillo, 2001-NMSC-004, ¶30
(“[T]he Human Rights Act does not permit the award of punitive damages.”); Gandy v. Wal-Mart Stores,
Inc., 117 N.M. 441, 443, 872 P.2d 859, 861 (1994) (“Punitive damages… are not recoverable under the
Human Rights Act.”)” (DRI, 2011, p. 266). See also Behrmann v. Phototron Corp. 795 P.2d 1015 (1990)
(“The treatises affirm that the phrase actual damages is synonymous with compensatory damages and that
compensatory damages are exclusive of punitive damages.”) Neither NCSL (2015) nor GELR (2016)
mention punitive damages.
New York
According to New York Executive Law §297(4)(c), punitive damages are not allowed: “(iii) awarding of
compensatory damages to the person aggrieved by such practice; (iv) awarding of punitive damages, in
cases of housing discrimination only…” DRI (2011, p. 274), GELR (2016), and NCSL (2015) also
indicate that punitive damages are not available.
North Carolina
Neither compensatory nor punitive damages are mentioned in the “Persons with Disabilities Protection
Act” (N.C.G.S.A. §168A-11). Rather this statute states “(b) Any relief granted by the court shall be

limited to declaratory and injunctive relief, including orders to hire or reinstate an aggrieved person or
admit such person to a labor organization. In a civil action brought to enforce provisions of this Chapter
relating to employment, the court may award back pay.” and reasonable attorney’s fees are also available
under part (d). NCSL (2015), GELR (2016), and DRI (2011, p. 289) also do not indicate that punitive
damages are available.
North Dakota
“Neither the department nor an administrative hearing officer may order compensatory or punitive
damages under this chapter” (N.D. Cent. Code §14-02.4-20). Neither NCSL (2015) nor DRI (2011, p.
305) nor GELR (2016) indicate that these damages are available.
Oklahoma
Unlike for other protected classes in Oklahoma, aggrieved employees with claims of disability
discrimination were previously able to pursue a private action and receive compensatory damages (DRI,
2011, p. 317). However, this was removed effective November 1, 2011, when an amendment (Laws
2011, c. 270, § 21) repealed Okla. Stat. tit. 25, §§1901. NCSL (2015) does not mention punitive damages
as being available after this legal change. It appears that punitive damages were never available before
this change, as neither the statute nor DRI (2011, p. 317) mention them as having been available. GELR
(2016) and NCSL (2015) also do not list punitive damages.
Pennsylvania
There is no mention of punitive damages in the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (43 P.S. §§ 951 et
seq.). DRI (2011, p. 340) argues that they are not available, citing Hoy v. Angelone, 554, Pa. 134, 720
A.2d 745 (1998), which stated: “[i]n sum, we are of the view that the Legislature’s silence on the issue of
punitive damages, together with the statutory language, interpreted consistent with the laws of statutory
construction and in the context of the nature and purpose of the Act, requires the conclusion that the
Legislature did not intend to permit the award of exemplary damages.” NCSL (2015) and GELR (2016)
also do not indicate that punitive damages are available.
South Dakota
According to South Dakota’s discrimination law, compensatory damages are available, but punitive
damages are not available. More specifically, the statute states that “…In a civil action, if the court or
jury finds that an unfair or discriminatory practice has occurred, it may award the charging party
compensatory damages. The court may grant as relief any injunctive order, including affirmative action,
to effectuate the purpose of this chapter. Punitive damages may be awarded under § 21-3-2 for a
violation of §§ 20-13-20 to 20-13-21.2, inclusive, 20-13-23.4, or 20-13-23.7” (SDCL §20-13-35.1).
However, these listed sections where punitive damages are allowed do not apply to employment
discrimination based on disability. NCSL (2015) also does not indicate that punitive damages are
available.
Tennessee
Neither the Tennessee Human Rights Act (THRA, T.C.A. §§4-21-401 et seq.) nor the Tennessee
Handicap Act (THA, T.C.A. §§4-21-401 et seq.) mention punitive damages (the later refers to the former
for the damages allowed). DRI (2011, p. 379) argues that punitive damages are not available, citing
Carver v. Citizen Utils. Co., 954 S.W.2d 34 (Tenn. 1997). See also Forbes v. Wilson County Emergency
Dist. 911 Bd., 1998, 966 S.W.2d 417, as cited by Westlaw (2013c, p. 18). NCSL (2015) also indicates
that punitive damages are not allowed and GELR (2016) does not list punitive damages.
Utah
The Utah Anti-Discrimination Act states that the following relief is available for those successful in an
employment discrimination claim:
“(b) provide relief to the complaining party, including:
xii

(i) reinstatement;
(ii) back pay and benefits;
(iii) attorneys' fees; and
(iv) costs” (U.C.A. §34A-5-107(9)(b)).
Punitive damages are not mentioned. According to DRI (2011, p. 391), NCSL (2015), and the Labor
Commission of the State of Utah 51, they are not allowed. GELR (2016) also does not list punitive
damages.
Virginia
According to Virginians with Disabilities Act: “Any circuit court having jurisdiction and venue pursuant
to Title 8.01, on the petition of any person with a disability, shall have the right to enjoin the abridgement
of rights set forth in this chapter and to order such affirmative equitable relief as is appropriate and to
award compensatory damages and to award to a prevailing party reasonable attorneys' fees, except that a
defendant shall not be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees unless the court finds that the claim was
frivolous, unreasonable or groundless, or brought in bad faith. Compensatory damages shall not include
damages for pain and suffering. Punitive or exemplary damages shall not be awarded” (Va. Code §51.546(A).). DRI (2011, p. 407), GELR (2016), and NCSL (2015) also confirm that punitive damages are not
available.
Washington
Washington’s employment non-discrimination law (R.C.W. §49.60.030) states that “actual damages” are
available, which has been interpreted to be uncapped compensatory damages (DRI, 2011, p. 491). DRI
(2011, p. 491), NCSL (2015), and other sources 52 state that punitive damages are not allowed, and GELR
(2016) does not list punitive damages. The lack of punitive damages is confirmed explicitly, with case
law citations, in the Washington Civil Jury Instructions 53:
“Exemplary or punitive damages are generally not recoverable under Washington law
unless expressly authorized by statute. Grays Harbor County v. Bay City Lumber Co., 47
Wn.2d 879, 289 P.2d 975 (1955); Anderson v. Dalton, 40 Wn.2d 894, 246 P.2d 853, 35
A.L.R.2d 302 (1952).
Punitive damages are contrary to Washington's public policy. E.g., Dailey v. North Coast
Life Ins. Co., 129 Wn.2d 572, 574, 919 P.2d 589 (1996). The Supreme Court held that
the Legislature, in enacting the state Law Against Discrimination (RCW Chapter 49.60),
which allows for “any other remedy authorized by … the United States Civil Rights Act
of 1964 as amended,” had not unambiguously manifested an intention to make punitive
damages available. Dailey v. North Coast Life Ins. Co, 129 Wn.2d at 575–77.”
Wisconsin
For most of its history, the Wisconsin Fair Employment Act (Wis. Stats. §§111.31–111.397) did not
mention punitive damages. For a brief period between the passage of 2009 Act 20 (effective June 8, 2009)
and the passage of 2011 Act 219 (effective April 20, 2012), the Wisconsin Fair Employment Act allowed
the same damages as the ADA, which could be recovered in circuit court after the completion of
administrative proceedings. But punitive damages were removed by 2011 Act 219. Wisconsin’s

Department of Workforce Development also notes that punitive damages are not currently available under
state law 54 and GELR (2016) does not mention punitive damages.
Wyoming
The Wyoming Fair Employment Practices Act (Wyo. Stat. 27-9-101 et seq.) does not mention
compensatory or punitive damages, or a lack thereof. DRI (2011, p. 449) seems to suggest that these
damages are not available. NCSL (2015) and Hickox (1996) also notes that punitive damages are not
available, and GELR (2016) does not mention punitive damages.
States with No Law
Alabama
Alabama only has an employment non-discrimination law that protects older workers, but not any other
groups.
Mississippi
Mississippi does not have an employment non-discrimination law.
Unclear Cases
Connecticut
The statute does not mention compensatory or punitive damages: “The court may grant a complainant in
an action brought in accordance with section 46a-100 such legal and equitable relief which it deems
appropriate including, but not limited to, temporary or permanent injunctive relief, attorney's fees and
court costs. The amount of attorney's fees allowed shall not be contingent upon the amount of damages
requested by or awarded to the complainant.” (Conn. Gen. Stat §46a-104)
The failure to mention compensatory and punitive damages made it unclear if these damages really were
not allowed. The case Michael Tomick v. United Parcel Service, Inc. clarified if punitive damages were
available under this statute. The court originally authorized punitive damages for disability discrimination
in this case, but the defendant’s motion to set aside the award of punitive damages was granted on
October 28, 2010. The Supreme Court of Connecticut then ruled on December 30, 2016 that punitive
damages were not available under Conn. Gen. Stat §46a-104 (Tomick v. United Parcel Service, Inc.,
SC19505 (Conn. 2017)). NCSL (2015) indicates that punitive damages are available (“litigated in court”)
but this is rather vague, providing little information. The confusion on punitive damages up until the final
Tomick case at the end of 2016 is discussed thoroughly by Michael D. Colonese and Cassie N. Jameson
in an article in the Connecticut Law Tribune 55. This ambiguity in case law was also mentioned by the
Williams Institute, who referenced difference cases 56.
As for compensatory damages, there were not allowed in employment cases since a 1995 Supreme Court
of Connecticut ruling that the Connecticut Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities does not
have the statutory authority to provide for these damages (Bridgeport Hospital v. Commission on Human
Rights and Opportunities 232 Conn. 91). See also Commission on Human Rights & Opportunities v.
Truelove & Maclean, Inc.,238 Conn. 337, 350, 680 A.2d 1261 (1996).
NCSL (2015) indicates that neither compensatory or punitive damages are expressly provided for in the
statute and further notes that the Connecticut Supreme Court did not provide for compensatory damages

in 1995 (referencing the above case).
In this case, we code Connecticut as not having larger damages than the federal ADA on the grounds that
compensatory damages are not available, and it was not sufficiently likely that punitive damages were
either, especially after the reversal of the punitive damages in the Tomick case in 2010.
A Brief Note on Age Discrimination Laws
As Table 1 in the paper shows, firm-size minimums are similar for disability and age discrimination laws,
but there are 12 states that have a different minimum (AL, AR, DE, GA, KY, IL, IN, LA, NE, OR, SD,
VA). With regard to damages, we focus on whether compensatory or punitive damages are allowed,
which they are not under federal age discrimination law (the ADEA). Some states require proof of intent
to discriminate in order for compensatory or punitive damages to be awarded, whereas others require
“willful” violation. Because the federal law allows additional liquidated, non-punitive damages (double
back pay and benefits) when there is “willful” violation, the question of whether the state requires intent
or willful violation may seem to be potentially relevant in deciding whether a state law offers greater
protection. However, willful violation is a much stricter standard than intent (Moberly, 1994). Moreover,
compensatory or punitive damages are almost certainly greater than liquidated damages, and they can be
much greater. As a consequence, a state law that provides compensatory or punitive damages, whether or
not this requires proof of intent or willful violation, clearly entails stronger remedies than the federal law,
so our classification captures whether either is allowed. For more details see Neumark and Song (2013).
