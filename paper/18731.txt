Alcohol Consumption, Deterrence and Crime in New York City
Hope Corman and Naci H. Mocan
NBER Working Paper No. 18731
January 2013
JEL No. I1,K0
ABSTRACT
This paper investigates the relationship between alcohol consumption, deterrence, and crime for New
York City. We examine high-frequency time-series data from 1983 to 2001 for one specific location
to examine the impacts of variations in both alcohol consumption and deterrence on seven “index”
crimes. We tackle the endogeneity of arrests and the police force by exploiting the temporal independence
of crime and deterrence in these high-frequency data, and we address the endogeneity of alcohol by
using instrumental variables where alcohol sales are instrumented with city and state alcohol taxes
and minimum drinking age. We find that alcohol consumption is positively related to assault, rape,
and larceny crimes but not murder, robbery, burglary, or motor vehicle theft. We find strong deterrence
for all crimes except assault and rape. Generally, deterrence effects are stronger than alcohol effects.

I. Introduction
Crime imposes enormous costs to society. In a careful accounting over a decade ago,
Anderson (1999) estimated the social costs of crime to exceed $1 trillion dollars in the U.S.
Recent research has demonstrated that an effective method to reduce crime is to increase
deterrence in the form of increased police force and arrests (Draca, Machin and Witt, 2011,
Machin and Marie, 2011, DiTella and Schargrodsky, 2004, Corman and Mocan, 2000). It is also
potentially important to examine indirect ways through which criminal activity can be impacted.
For example, researchers have noted a strong association between alcohol consumption and
crime. Over 15% of victims of violent crime reported the perpetrator being under the influence
of alcohol when the crime was committed.1 The violent crime rate (total homicide, rape, robbery
and aggravated assault per 100,000 population) in the United States went down from 597 in 1980
to 404 in 2010, which is a 32 percent decline. The property crime went down from 5,353 to
2,942 per 100,000 people: a dramatic 45 percent decline. A report by the National Institute on
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) (LaVallee and Yi, 2012) indicates that consumption of
spirits decreased by 29 percent between 1980 and 2010. Based on these correlations and trends,
it is tempting to infer that the drop in criminal activity is, to a large extent, due to the decline in
alcohol consumption. However it is uncertain whether the observed crime-alcohol correlation is
the reflection of a cause-and-effect relationship. The issue is important from a public policy
perspective. If the correlation between alcohol and crime is due to the impact of confounding
factors that influence both the criminal activity and alcohol consumption, then policies that aim

1

http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cvus/current/cv0832.pdf and data from the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring
Program in 2003 indicate that about 10% of arrestees tested positive for alcohol, and almost half of arrestees had
engaged in binge drinking in the past month (https://www.ncjrs.gov/nij/adam/adam2003.pdf, Table 10).

2

to curb alcohol consumption will be ineffective for crime control, as the root cause of criminal
behavior is not alcohol consumption but these confounding factors. 2
There exists a large volume of literature that examines the impact of deterrence variables
on crime, while another literature has examined the impact of alcohol policies on crime.
Although there is some agreement that alcohol policies that aim to curb alcohol consumption
have a negative impact on crime, and that more arrests deter crimes, the literature is still mixed
as to which types of crimes are most affected by alcohol policies, which types of crimes are most
easily deterred by increased arrests, and the magnitudes of the effects. Furthermore, there exists
no credible evidence on the causal impact of alcohol consumption on crime.
The purpose of this study is to add to this literature by systematically examining the
effects of alcohol consumption, and of arrests and police presence on crimes in New York City
over the period 1983 to 2002. High frequency (monthly) time-series data allow us to circumvent
reverse causality from crime to deterrence by using lagged values of explanatory variables in
empirical specification (Corman and Mocan, 2005, 2000). For example, although crime and
arrest influence each other contemporaneously, an increase in crime in a given month cannot
impact the arrests for that crime in the previous month. Using once-lagged arrests in monthly
data enables us to avoid reverse causality from crime to arrests, while allowing us to analyze the
impact of last month’s arrests on this month’s crime. In the case of the relationship between
alcohol and crime, we use an instrumental variable approach to estimate the impact of alcohol
use on crime, where alcohol use is instrumented with real alcohol tax and legal drinking age.
Thus, we are able to address causality-related issues in examining both factors believed to be
highly predictive of criminal behavior.
2

Also, policies aimed at reducing alcohol consumption may not have as strong an impact on alcohol consumption.
Recent work by Ruhm et al. (2011), for example, questions previous estimates of a high price elasticity of demand
for beer.

II. Previous Literature
To frame the existing literature and the contribution of this paper, note that the
interrelationship between crime, alcohol use and deterrence can be analyzed within a framework
that consists of the following equations.
CRi = f (Econi, Deterk, Xi, Ai , ui)

(1)
(2)

Ai = g (Pk, Ii, Xi, ei)
Equation (1) is a standard crime supply equation where criminal activity of person i is

determined by economic factors pertaining to the person (Econi) such as the relevant labor
market wage of the person, deterrence variables (Deterk) that vary at some aggregate level k such
as the neighborhood, or city (e.g. the arrest rates, and the size of the police force), and other
attributes of the individual, Xi, as well as the alcohol consumption, represented by Ai.
Unobservable personal attributes, such as risk aversion or time preference, are captured by u.
Equation (2) represents the demand for alcohol for person i. It is a function of Pk which
stands for the price and availability of alcohol which vary at the aggregate level k, the person’s
income (Ii), and other personal characteristics Xi. The error term ei stands for tastes and
unobserved individual characteristics that impact alcohol consumption.
The impact of alcohol consumption on criminal activity is difficult to estimate using the
structural Equation (1). This is because difficult-to-observe attributes, captured by u in Equation
(1), are likely to impact both criminal activity and alcohol consumption. Examples include
religiosity, time preference, or peer pressures. Consequently, inference obtained from models
that treat alcohol consumption as an exogenous variable in estimating crime equations may be
inaccurate.

4

Recognizing this problem, a number of researchers have estimated reduced form crime
equations, which are obtained by substituting Equation (2) into Equation (1)
(3) CRi = h (Pk, Ii, Econi, Deterk, Xi, ui, ei)
In this strategy, the price and availability of alcohol enter the crime equation directly as
independent variables as shown by Equation (3). If the price of alcohol (or alcohol excise tax) or
alcohol availability are not influenced by the extent of criminal activity, and if they are not
correlated with unobservable factors that influence crime, then the parameters obtained from
equation (3) are unbiased. However, in this case, the researcher can only make an inference on
the relationship between alcohol price and crime, and not on alcohol consumption and crime.
Furthermore, the assumption that alcohol prices and alcohol availability are uncorrelated with
unobservable factors (depicted by u) may not be valid. For example, if religiosity is a
component of u in equation (3), it could be plausible that alcohol availability is low and alcohol
taxes are high in those locations (counties, cities, states) with strong religious beliefs. If
religiosity lowers criminal propensity, then one would observe a positive association between
alcohol availability and criminal activity, but this correlation is an artifact of the unobserved
religious preferences.
With this background, the key findings of previous research are summarized below.
Criminal Deterrence
There is a voluminous literature on the impact of deterrence on crime, beginning with the
seminal empirical work of Becker (1974) and Ehrlich (1973). Much of the literature estimated
various forms of Equation (1), usually by omitting alcohol or drug use.3 Reverse causality from

3

Corman and Mocan (2000) is an exception.

5

crime to arrests is addressed by using data on natural experiments in which the extent of
deterrence is increased or decreased exogenously (Di Tella and Schargrodsky, 2004, Draca,
Machin and Witt, 2011, Drago, Galbiati and Vertova, 2009), or by exploiting the timing of crime
commission and arrests in high frequency data (Corman and Mocan, 2000). Although there is a
general consensus that arrests deter crimes, studies find that the elasticity of crime with respect to
arrests varies, depending on the crime. For example, Levitt (1998) found stronger arrest
elasticities for robbery and burglary than for murder and rape crimes, while Corman and Mocan
(2005) found stronger elasticities for robbery and motor vehicle theft than for assaults. Thus, it
is important to take into account that different crimes may experience different responses to
arrests.
Alcohol Taxes and Crime.
There are two categories of studies examining the impact of alcohol on crime in the
economics literature. The larger group examines the effect of alcohol using a reduced-form
effect of a particular policy using versions of Equation (3). For example, numerous studies have
examined the impact of alcohol taxes on crime. As reviewed by Carpenter and Dobkin (2010),
most studies find some evidence that higher alcohol taxes deter at least some crimes. We report
on two recent studies which examine the impact of alcohol taxes on specific crimes, while
controlling for arrest rates. Markowitz (2005) used data from the National Crime Victimization
Surveys from 1992 through 1994 and found that beer taxes significantly decreased assaults in
both standard regressions and in fixed effects models, but that there were no significant effects of
beer taxes on rape/other sex crimes. The negative effect of beer taxes on crime was marginally
significant in her regular regressions, but insignificant in her fixed effects model. Additionally,
she found deterrence effects of arrest on assaults and robberies but not on rape crimes in her

6

regular regression models. Desimone (2001), in a study that focused on drug prices, also
examined the impact of beer taxes, using aggregated data for 29 cities from 1981 to 1995, and
investigating the standard “index” crimes -- murder, rape, assault, robbery, burglary, larceny,
auto theft. His models included both city- and year- fixed effects, and he found that higher beer
taxes significantly reduced rape, assault, larceny and auto theft but not murder, burglary or
robbery.
Drinking Age and Crime
Carpenter (2007) has argued that much of the impetus for age restrictions and age-related
sanctions on drinking arose from concerns about drunk driving, and not due to concerns with
other violent or property crimes. If this is the case, the effects of these laws on property and
violent crimes are unlikely to be biased due to issues of policy endogeneity. Carpenter (2007)
examined the impact of zero-tolerance laws (which lowered the blood alcohol threshold for
drivers under age 21) on aggregated property and violent crime over the period 1988 to 1997 in
MSA’s. He found, holding constant policy agency and year effects, beer tax rates, and other
policy variables, that zero-tolerance laws significantly reduced property (but not violent) crime
arrests of 18-20 year olds. Carpenter and Dobkin (2010) used a regression discontinuity design
to examine the effect of turning 21 on violent and property crime arrests in California in 20012005. They found that turning 21 increases alcohol consumption, and also increases arrests for
robbery and assault, but not for murder, rape, larceny, burglary or auto theft. As these authors
acknowledge in their literature review, a drawback of the age-related research is that it relies on
arrest data in order to ascertain age, and it is possible that the effect of alcohol on arrests is not
due to crime commission, but to an increased chance of getting caught.

7

Alcohol Consumption and Crime
Three recent studies examined the impact of alcohol consumption on crime using a panel
of state data. Raphael and Winter-Ebmer (2001) and Lin (2008) both analyzed the impact of
unemployment on crime, using state panels from the 1970’s to 1997 (Raphael and WinterEbmer) and to 2000 (Lin). Because alcohol consumption was not their key variable, possible
endogeneity of this variable has not been addressed. Both papers have aggregated crimes into
property and violent crime categories. Winter-Ebmer and Lin both found that, controlling for
linear trends, alcohol does not seem to impact property crime commission. In their preferred
model, the former study does not find a significant positive effect of alcohol consumption on
violent crime commission, while the latter does.
Note that studies that employ state-level or county-level aggregated data suffer from
the issue of averaging crime and alcohol consumption in urban, suburban, and rural areas. There
is at least as much within-state variation in the relationship between alcohol and crime than there
is between the states. Second, for aggregated annual panel data, there exists a potential problem
in dealing with the sequence of events within the year of the observation. Researchers often
assume that price or availability of alcohol are exogenous to crime. However, within a twelvemonth period, it is possible that increased alcohol-related crime causes legislators to raise taxes
or reduce the availability of alcohol. That is, there is enough time for causality to run in the
opposite direction from that hypothesized when annual data are employed.
The only recent study to explicitly examine the impact of alcohol consumption on crime
is by Zimmerman and Benson (2007), who perform a two-stage least-squares model to examine
the impact of beer, wine, and liquor consumption on rape, using a panel of state-level data from

8

1982 to 2000. They find strong positive effects of alcohol consumption on rape, while finding
significant deterrence effects of rape arrest rates lagged by one year.
III. Contribution of this Paper
Despite the volume of two parallel literatures examining the effect of deterrence on crime
on one hand, and the effect of alcohol on crime on the other, no study was able to analyze the
impact of deterrence and alcohol consumption on a range of crimes within the same framework.
Each particular study in the previous literature tends to focus on one aspect while, perhaps,
controlling for the other. More specifically, studies that focus on crime-deterrence relationship
either omit alcohol use from the analysis, or consider alcohol as an exogenous variable. Papers
that investigate the impact of alcohol taxes or alcohol policies on crime do not carefully control
for deterrence variables due to data limitations. Furthermore, there exists no study that provides
a credible structural estimate of alcohol elasticity of crime with the exception of a couple of
papers that addressed the endogeneity of alcohol consumption (Gyimah-Brempong, 2001,
Zimmerman and Benson, 2007).4 Thus, to arrive at a structural estimate of alcohol elasticity of
crime, one needs to calculate the implied instrument-variables estimates using the reduced form
crime equations (such as the one depicted by Equation 3) and the alcohol demand equations
(such as Equation 2). More specifically, denote the impact of P on crime in Equation (3) by θ,
and the impact of price on alcohol in Equation (2) by β. Then, the implied-IV estimate of the
causal impact of alcohol on crime is θ/β. However, this calculation is complicated because both

4

Zimmerman and Benson (2007) used two-stage least squares in identifying the impact of alcohol on rape using
state panels from 1982 to 2000, and identifying alcohol using tax rates, minimum drinking age, plus other alcoholrelated policies. Gyimah-Brempong (2001) used cross-sectional crime data from over 300 census tracts in Detroit
in 1992 to analyze the impact of liquor store density on crime. This study relies on the plausibility of the assumption
that the two instruments (gas stations and median rent) significantly explain the location of liquor stores but that
they are not related to crime.

9

the data sets and the variables employed in the literature widely differ regarding estimating
Equations (2) and (3); so it is not possible to arrive at a coherent implied-IV estimate.
The current paper takes a different approach to examining the impact of alcohol
consumption on crime. We examine high-frequency time-series data for one specific location to
examine the impacts of variations in both alcohol consumption and deterrence on seven “index”
crimes. Our approach has a number of advantages. By focusing on one location, we can hold
constant many of the unobservable factors (such as criminal justice reporting frameworks)
unique to different cities or states. By using monthly data, our analyses are not subject to policy
endogeneity, since it takes several months to alter policies. By estimating disaggregated crimes,
we can allow deterrence and alcohol effects to vary by specific crime. By using high frequency
data while controlling for long-run trends, we are not conflating their effects. Finally, the
frequent changes in alcohol taxes in our time period (both increases and decreases) allow
identification of alcohol consumption in our instrumental variable models.
IV. Empirical Specification and Data
Following previous work which used similar data for New York City (Corman and
Mocan, 2005 and Corman and Mocan, 2000), time series methods are applied to investigate the
impact of alcohol on violent crime, holding constant other potential determinants of criminal
activity. Specifically, models of the following form are estimated.
(4)

where CRi,t stands for crime of type i in month t (i=1 for assault, i=2 for robbery, i=3 for
burglary, etc.). ARi represents arrests for crime type i, POL stands for the number of uniformed
police officers, W is the real minimum wage, AFDC/TANF is the number of AFDC/TANF cases
10

in New York City, ALCOHOL stands for alcohol consumption and POP is the size of the
population ages 15 to 49. S represents a set of monthly dummies to account for seasonal effects.
We analyze separately seven “index” felony offenses; that is, we estimate equation (4) separately
for each type of crime. High frequency data (monthly observations) allow us to circumvent
standard problems of simultaneity between crime and its determinants, including alcohol
consumption. Following Corman and Mocan (2000, 2005), in this specification it is postulated
that the number of crimes committed in one month depends on the past levels of the same
criminal activity (j≥1), and the past arrests for that crime (k≥1). Arrests are lagged one month to
avoid reverse causality from crime.

On the other hand, the contemporaneous values of the

police, the minimum wage, AFDC/TANF cases, alcohol consumption and population 15 to 49
are included (q≥0, p≥0, d≥0, g≥0, r≥0) in addition to their lagged values.
While an increase in alcohol consumption in a given month is expected to influence
criminal activity in that month as depicted by Equation (4), an increase in crime is unlikely to
impact alcohol consumption through a channel of policy modification. This is because a policy
alteration or legislative change such as a tax increase would not take place in the same month as
the increase in crime. On the other hand, if the change in crime has an impact on criminal
income, alcohol consumption can be influenced contemporaneously. It is also possible that
alcohol consumption is correlated with unobserved factors that may also influence criminal
activity. Because of these concerns we will instrument alcohol consumption with two exogenous
variables: alcohol tax and legal minimum drinking age. As our literature review revealed, these
two variables are expected to influence alcohol consumption and we demonstrate empirically
that they indeed impact alcohol consumption. There is, however, no reason to expect a direct
influence of taxes or minimum drinking age on criminal activity.

11

Arrest, police, and crime data have been compiled from data collected at the Crime
Analysis Unit of the New York City Police Department (NYPD). Arrests are compiled through
December of 2001, when the NYPD ceased reporting on arrests. We collect crime reports for the
same time period. Our analyses focus on the “index” crimes of: murder, rape, robbery, assault,
burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft. Variations in the size of the population could affect
both alcohol consumption and crime. We hold constant population aged 15 to 49, the group
most likely to be committing crimes.5
Empirical analyses also include the number of police officers in New York City. The
variable is "total uniform strength," and consists of the number of sworn officers on the payroll,
and it excludes individuals who have left the police force but are receiving terminal paychecks.
Similarly, it does not include civilians, or officers who have been hired but have not completed
their six-month training course at the Police Academy.6 Data on number of police were
compiled from the Office of Management and Planning of the NYPD.7
Our two economic variables reflect conditions facing low-wage individuals, who are
more likely to engage in criminal behavior than higher-wage individuals. First, we include the
number of cases of individuals on cash assistance in New York City (Aid to Families with
Dependent Children (AFCD) which became Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF)
in 1996. These data are collected from published reports of the New York City Department of
Social Services Human Resources Administration. The change in welfare programs had a
dramatic impact on the number of cases that were on welfare, both in New York, and in the

Annual data on population by age for New York City was obtained from the New York State Department of Vital
Statistics. (http://www.health.ny.gov/nysdoh/vital_statistics/ accessed 11/22/2011). We interpolate monthly figures
from the annual ones.
6
In 1995, the NYPD merged the transit and housing police with the rest of the Department. We have subtracted the
estimated number of transit and housing police since those dates to create a consistent series.

entire nation (for example, see Schoeni and Blank, 2000). To account for this shift in welfare
caseloads, we include an indicator for post-welfare reform in New York.8
Our second variable pertaining to economic conditions is the real minimum wage. The
real minimum wage is calculated by using the nominal minimum wage obtained from the New
York State Department of Labor9 and the monthly New York –Northern New Jersey-Long Island
Metropolitan Area Consumer Price Index (CPI), obtained from the US Bureau of Labor
Statistics. 10
Alcohol consumption is proxied by alcohol sales. These data are obtained from the New
York State Department of Taxation and Finance (NYDTF). Beginning in 1980, New York City
imposed an excise tax on beer and spirits (but not wine). As the tax collector, the NYDTF
obtained sales volume for both types of beverages. Sales data were available from April of 1983,
onward. Similar to previous studies, cited above, we converted alcohol volume to total ethanol
volume, using a weighted average of the two types of beverages.11
We focus on two alcohol policies -- taxes and the minimum drinking age. Tax rates for
New York State and New York City were obtained from the NYDTF. New York State increased
the beer tax three times between 1970 and 1995 (from 4.4 cents per gallon in 1970 up to 21 cents
per gallon by the end of 1995). Since 1995, New York State lowered the beer tax four times,
resulting in a tax of 11cents per gallon by the end of 2005. According to Sack (1995), the 1996
drop in the beer tax was due to intense lobbying of George Pataki and Republican
Representatives in New York State by the beer and soda industries. This first reduction, was a 5

11
For completeness, it would be preferable to have information on wine consumption, as well. However, these data
are not available for New York City. Note that for the State of New York, ethanol consumption from wine
comprised the lowest fraction among the three types of alcohol—about 18% in 1992, for example.

cent or over 20% reduction in taxes. Overall, beer taxes were almost halved during the Pataki
administration. New York State raised the nominal spirits tax four times between 1970 and 2005
(from $2.25 per gallon to $6.43 per gallon). New York City imposed a 12 cent tax per gallon of
beer and a 26.4 cent tax per liter of spirits in 1980, and has not changed the nominal tax since
that date. We also consider the federal beer and spirits taxes.12 When calculating a combined
tax rate, we calculate the tax per gallon of ethanol, weighted by relative ethanol consumption of
the two types of alcohol.13 Taxes are converted to real values, using the NY Metropolitan CPI,
described above.
Our second policy variable is the minimum legal drinking age. Information on the
minimum legal drinking age was obtained from the Alcohol Policy Information System of the
National Institute on Alcohol Use and Alcoholism. The minimum legal drinking age was
increased from 18 to 19 in December of 1982, and was raised to 21 in December of 1985.
V. Patterns in the Data and Descriptive Statistics
Figure 1 presents the behavior of total crime and police officers in New York City
between January 1970 and December 2005. Also presented in the graph are the underlying
trends for three different time periods. There is a remarkably strong negative relationship
between the two variables. When the number of uniformed police officers were declining during
the 1970s, crime was rising. The number of police officers first rose and then declined in the
1980s and early 1990s, and crime exhibited the reverse pattern during that period: it declined
when the police force was rising and rose when police was declining. Finally, the increase in the
number of police officers beginning in 1991 coincided with the steady decline in crime during
that same time period.
12

Data were obtained from the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
On average, about 57% of the ethanol consumption in New York City (excluding wine) was from beer and about
43% was from spirits.

13

14

Figure 2 displays the trends in alcohol consumption and crime in the period of April 1983
to December 2001. Examining the trends, it appears that both criminal activity and alcohol
consumption declined during our period of study, but that the steepest declines in alcohol
consumption were at the beginning of the time period, whereas the decline in crime appeared to
occur later.
Because the alcohol consumption variable is available for the period of April 1983 to
December 2001, the main regressions are based on this time period. Later in the paper we also
estimate the regressions without the alcohol variable. This exercise allows us to extent the
sample back to January 1970 and enables us to investigate the extent to which the estimated
impacts of deterrence variables and the poverty indicators are altered by this extension.
Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1 for both the main sample of 1983-2001 as well as
for 1970 to 2001.
V. Results
Following Corman and Mocan (2000) and Corman and Mocan (2005) we applied unit
root tests to all variables to investigate whether they are governed by stochastic, rather than
deterministic trends. We could not reject the hypothesis of a unit root in all variables with the
exception of alcohol consumption and population ages 15 to 49. Therefore we de-trended these
two variables by running them on their linear trends and obtaining trend-deviations. All other
variables are de-trended by taking first-differences. The lag length of each variable is determined
by the Akaike Information Criterion. The variables are in natural logarithms and the standard
errors are estimated using robust covariance matrices with serial correlation up to 12 lags.
Table 2 presents the IV- regression results in a summarized form, where the sum of the
estimated coefficients are displayed for each crime category. The top panel of Table 2 contains

15

violent crimes: assault, rape, murder and robbery; the bottom panel pertains to burglary, motor
vehicle theft and grand larceny. Entries represent the percent change in the dependent variable
due to a one percent increase in the explanatory variable. Robust standard errors of the estimated
coefficients (or of the summed coefficients) are reported in parentheses. The arrest data end in
December 2001, but the crime data are available beyond that date. Because the crime
regressions use lagged arrest as explanatory variables, the estimation sample goes until January
2002. The full set of results is displayed in Table A3 in the appendix. The models are estimated
with instrumental variables where alcohol use is instrumented with minimum drinking age and
alcohol tax. The first stage results are very strong in that the F-values of the instruments are in
range of 21 to 33. The first-stage regressions are reported in Appendix Table A4.
It is evident from results in Table 2 that arrests have a significant negative impact on
most crimes. For example, a 10 percent increase in murder arrests reduces murder by 2.1%, and
a 10% increase in grand larceny arrests reduces that crime by about 1%. Burglaries, motor
vehicle thefts and robberies are also significantly deterred by arrests, with magnitudes in the
same range. The number of AFDC/TANF cases also have an impact on certain crimes.
Specifically, an increase in poverty, approximated by an increase in AFDC/TANF cases, has a
positive impact on assaults, robberies and burglaries. Minimum wage does not have a
statistically significant effect on any of the seven index crimes. Controlling for crime-specific
arrests, the size of the police force, the AFDC/TANF cases, and real minimum wage, we find the
strongest impact of alcohol on two violent crimes – assault and rape. This result is consistent
with the notion that individuals under the influence may be both more aggressive and less
mindful of consequences of their actions. For rape, an additional possible explanation is that
increased alcohol consumption increases the likelihood of becoming a victim. It is also the case

16

that these are the two crimes that do not seem to be deterred by arrests or police presence. In
case of larceny, we find that it is deterred by its own arrests, and that alcohol consumption
increases their occurrence. Again, this result may reflect both greater propensity to steal and
greater propensity to become a victim. For our other property-related crimes—robbery,
burglary, and motor vehicle theft, we find no significant effects of alcohol on crime commission.
For comparison, we present the OLS results in Table 3. A comparison of Table 3 with
Table 2 shows that the effects of own arrests on crimes are not sensitive to whether alcohol is
instrumented. In case of rape, the impact of alcohol is much reduced and it is no longer
statistically significant when then model is estimated by OLS instead of instrumental variables.14
We find a similar result for larcenies: the impact of alcohol consumption on larcenies is not
different from zero when the model is estimated by OLS. The impact of alcohol consumption on
murder is greater in magnitude in the OLS specification compared to the IV results, and it is
statistically significant, consistent with the possibility that there is an unobserved factor,
unaccounted for in the OLS specification, which might affect both greater drinking and more
murders.
Although crime in a given month is expected to be impacted by alcohol consumption in
that month, it is possible that consumption of alcohol may not coincide with the month of the
sale. That is, alcohol sales in a given month may translate to consumption in the next month.
This could be because alcohol is not perishable and consumers may engage in consumption
smoothing in the presence of anticipated price changes. For example, if consumers expect a tax
increase to be effective in month t, they may increase alcohol demand in month t-1 (when the
14

This result is consistent with the findings of Zimmerman and Benson (2007) who attribute the downward bias in
the OLS rape results to endogenous victim actions. That is, if women perceive a higher probability of being raped,
they may reduce their alcohol consumption. Of course, this interpretation should be made with caution as our
results are based on aggregate data.

17

price is still intact) and decrease their demand in t (when the price is higher due to an increase in
tax). If this is the case, alcohol sales go down in time t in comparison to t-1, but alcohol
consumption remains the same over these two periods because of smoothing.
Under this scenario, it would be a better strategy to model crime in month t to depend on
alcohol sales in month t-1. To entertain this possibility, we estimated the same models with one
exception: the contemporaneous value of alcohol is replaced with its once-lagged value and it is
instrumented with once-lagged alcohol tax and minimum drinking age. The results, summarized
in Table 4, are very similar to those reported in Table 2.
VII. Robustness of the Results and Extensions
To investigate the sensitivity of the results to variations in lag lengths, we estimate the
models with arbitrary lag lengths. For each crime, we keep the lag lengths of the lagged
dependent variable and that of alcohol intact and change the lag lengths of other variables
arbitrarily. For example, in case of robbery, the benchmark model includes 2 lags of robbery as
explanatory variables in addition to lags 0 to 4 for police, and the contemporaneous value of
AFDC, as well as its first lag, along with the contemporaneous values of the real minimum wage
and alcohol consumption. We keep the length of the lagged dependent variable the same as in
the benchmark model for robbery (2 lags in this case) and employ the contemporaneous value of
alcohol consumption, but we enter other explanatory variables with haphazard lags, ranging from
1 lag to 6 lags. These are arbitrary specifications, nevertheless the results, presented in Appendix
Table A1, show that the impact of each variable is similar to those reported in Table 2, although
as expected, the statistical significance of the estimated impacts is spotty. Nevertheless,
consistent with the benchmark results reported in Table 2, the impact of alcohol is positive and
significant in case of assault, rape and grand larceny.
18

To examine the extent to which the impacts of the explanatory variables are sensitive to
the alcohol consumption, we dropped alcohol consumption from the crime regressions and reestimated the models. The results, reported in Appendix Table A2 show that excluding alcohol
does not influence the effect of other variables on crime. For example, the impact of own-arrests
have a significant deterrent effect in case of murder, robbery, burglary and grand larceny as was
the case in the IV-regressions of Table 2 that included alcohol consumption.
Although the alcohol data go back only until April 1983, the crime, arrest and police data
as well as data on AFDC are available since 1970. Therefore, we estimated the models without
the alcohol variable for the sample 1970-2001. Table 5, which is similar to Table 2, presents the
summary of the results. In these regressions, which are based on a larger sample period, police
has a significant impact on assault, robbery and burglary. Note that robbery arrests have an
additional impact on robberies; burglary arrests reduce burglaries and motor vehicle arrests have
a negative impact on motor-vehicle thefts. The impact of police is significant, with elasticities
of -0.3 in case of burglary, -0.7 in case of robbery and about -1.0 in case of assault.
VIII. Summary and Conclusion
This paper has two purposes. First, it aims to shed new light into the impact of alcohol
consumption on criminal activity. Second, it aims to investigate the relative impacts of alcohol
and deterrence on crime. While there is substantial evidence on the causal effect of police and
arrests on crime, the causal effect of alcohol consumption on crime is less certain. Previous
work has encountered major empirical challenges to identify the effect of alcohol consumption
on crime. This is because of the difficulty in finding convincing and viable instruments for
alcohol consumption in crime regressions. In micro data, it is exceedingly difficult to find

19

instruments that are correlated with an individual’s alcohol consumption but are unrelated to his
criminal propensity. Instruments that are not individual-specific but that vary at the aggregate
level (such as state-level alcohol taxes) tend not to be powerful enough to explain individuallevel variation in alcohol consumption, and they are likely to be correlated with local attributes
that also impact crime. Alternative strategies, such as estimating reduced form crime equations
using aggregate data by employing price and availability of alcohol as exogenous variables are
viable, but they do not provide estimates of the impact of alcohol consumption on crime.
In this paper we estimated the impact of deterrence and alcohol consumption on crime
within the same empirical framework. We tackled the endogeneity of arrests and the police force
by exploiting the temporal independence of crime and deterrence in these high-frequency data.
We tackled the endogeneity of alcohol by instrumenting alcohol sales with city, state, and
federal alcohol taxes and minimum drinking age.
The results show that between the years of 1983 and 2002, controlling for the impact of
arrests, police, the minimum wage, the number of the AFDC cases, and the size of the population
ages 15 to 49, an increase in alcohol consumption has a positive impact on assaults, rapes and
grand larcenies, but alcohol has no impact on murders, robberies, burglaries and motor-vehicle
thefts. On the other hand, murder arrests deter murders, robbery arrests deter robberies.
Similarly, an increase in own-arrests generate reduction in burglaries, motor-vehicle thefts and
grand larcenies. The magnitude of the impact of arrests, in terms of elasticities, are greater than
the impact of alcohol, except for rape and assault.
These results are robust to various model modifications. Estimating the models for a
longer time span allows us to incorporate more variation in the deterrence variables, but it comes

20

at the expense of omitting alcohol because alcohol data are not available prior to 1983. These
specifications confirm the deterrent effect of arrests and reveal additional deterrence of police.
Taken together, these results indicate that although variations in alcohol consumption
have an impact on certain crimes, the effectiveness of deterrence variables in reducing crime is
stronger in magnitude and it is pertinent for a larger set of crimes. It should also be noted that
because rape is a violent crime that is not easily deterred through police, alcohol policies may be
a viable alternative for reducing this crime. It should be kept in mind, however, that the relative
cost effectiveness of policies designed to reduce alcohol consumption and to enhance deterrence
is unclear. Curbing alcohol consumption may be a simpler policy lever in comparison to
enhancing deterrence because a tax increase or an increase in drinking age is less costly to
implement for the policy maker from a financial point of view, although they may be
complicated to implement politically. An increase in the size of the police force, on the other
hand, may be less complicated politically but it is more costly financially.

Arrests pertain to arrests for each specific crime listed in columns. Robust standard errors are reported in
parentheses when the corresponding variable enters with no lag. Otherwise, the values in parentheses are
the robust standard errors of the summed coefficients. Sample sizes differ slightly between crimes based
on the number of lags in the regressions. *** p<0.01; **p<0.05; *p<0.10. Each regression also includes
population ages 15-49, monthly dummy variables, and an indicator variable to account for the structural
change in AFCD/TANF in November 1986.

Crime lags for each crime regression are the same as in the benchmark models reported in Table 2.
Alcohol consumption enters with no lag and it is instrumented with legal minimum drinking age in New
York City and lagged real city and state alcohol tax (see the text for the definition) as in the benchmark
model. Arrests enter with lags 1 to N. Police, AFCD/TANF and Minimum wage enter with lags 0 to N.
The values in parentheses are the robust standard errors of the summed coefficients. Arrests pertain to
arrests for each specific crime listed in columns The instruments for alcohol consumption legal minimum
drinking age in New York City and real city and state alcohol tax (see the text for the definition). ***
p<0.01; **p<0.05; *p<0.10. Each regression also includes population ages 15-49, monthly dummy
variables, and an indicator variable to account for the structural change in AFCD/TANF in November
1986.
