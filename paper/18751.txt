Forecasting the Recovery from the Great Recession: Is This Time Different?

ABSTRACT
This paper asks whether the slow recovery of the US economy from the trough of the Great Recession
was anticipated, and identifies some of the factors that contributed to surprises in the course of the
recovery. It constructs a narrative using news reports and government announcements to identify policy
and financial shocks. It then compares forecasts and forecast revisions of GDP to the narrative. Successive
financial and fiscal shocks emanating from Europe, together with self-inflicted wounds from the political
stalemate over the US fiscal situation, help explain the slowing of the pace of an already slow recovery.

It was well-understood that the US economy was slowing heading into 2008, and indeed
policy moved toward stimulus with an aim to moderate the slowdown in growth. The Federal
Reserve moved to cut the Federal Funds rate sharply beginning in late 2007. Congress passed
fiscal stimulus measures—economic stimulus payments and an extension of bonus
depreciation—in the first half of 2008. Nonetheless, well into 2008, the perception was that the
US economy was likely to avoid recession despite rapid declines in housing prices and serious
financial market distress. In Europe, the perception was similar. Indeed, because of a view that
the risk of inflation was greater than the risk of recession, the ECB held its target rate constant
until October 2008. The preemptive fiscal and monetary policy in the US likely delayed the
slowdown in growth.1 Obviously, they did not preempt the Great Recession.
The failure of economists, forecasters, and officials to forecast the Great Recession eerily
parallels the period before the Great Depression. Output fell sharply and unexpectedly when
financial markets became seriously distressed and consumption, investment, and hiring
collapsed. While we could easily write a paper paralleling our analysis of the Great Depression
(see Dominguez, Fair, and Shapiro 1988), we believe that the failure to forecast the Great
Recession is well understood.

Instead, we take on the different, but related, question of

forecasting the recovery from the Great Recession. In particular, we ask whether the slow
recovery from the trough of the Great Recession was anticipated, and what factors contributed to
surprises in the course of the recovery.
Some analysts, notably Reinhart and Rogoff’s (2009) prescient and timely analysis,
suggested that the recovery would be very slow. This perspective was not the consensus near the
trough in early 2009. Romer and Bernstein (2009)—in an analysis that was based on large-scale,
macroeconometric models—forecast a fairly rapid economic rebound provided there was
substantial fiscal and monetary stimulus. Dissenting views on the efficacy of fiscal stimulus
(Cogan, Cwik, Taylor, and Wieland 2010) were also based on a model with a quick return to
trend. Hence, though the Reinhart-Rogoff view has been borne out by events, it was far from
universally evident at the early stages of the recovery.
1

Sahm, Shapiro, and Slemrod (2010) show despite an MPC of about 1/3 from the 2008 Economic Stimulus Payments that they were so large
and dispersed so quickly that they noticeably increased growth of consumption in the second and third quarter of 2008 and reduced growth in the
fourth quarter.

This paper aims to enrich the account of the slow recovery. In particular, it seeks to
document the role that successive financial shocks in Europe had in delaying the recovery in the
United States. In three successive years—2010, 2011, and 2012—the United States appeared
poised early in the year for sustained, moderate economic growth. In each of these years, the
(relative) optimism of the first half of the year was followed by downward revisions of growth
expectations. While the baseline, slow recovery in the US clearly is rooted in domestic financial
and fiscal impediments to growth, our analysis suggests that tentative recovery in the US from
these impediments was stalled repeatedly by shocks emanating from Europe.
The next section of the paper discusses the narrative evidence that documents the role of
Europe in the protracted and ongoing financial/fiscal crisis. The following section examines
economic forecasts and their revisions. It establishes a strong, albeit circumstantial, case that the
financial/fiscal shocks from Europe played an important role since 2010 in the downward
revision of the outlook for recovery in the United States.
I. Narrative
Identifying the factors that drive economic growth is the central question in
macroeconomics.

Academics and policymakers have long debated the role for fiscal and

monetary policy in stimulating growth; the efficacy of US macroeconomic policies undertaken
during the Great Recession is no exception. There was strong opposition to financial and fiscal
policies that were put in place around the globe in the throes of the crisis, reflecting both
philosophical differences of opinion as well as the difficulty of forecasting the likely effects of
policy during crises. Indeed, even after the fact, disentangling the effects of specific stimulus
policies will intrinsically be confounded by the fact that the same factors that led to the policy
change are likely correlated with other developments in the global economy. This ubiquitous
omitted variable bias—combined with the uniqueness of the events in post-World War II time
series—suggests that regression analysis of GDP growth during the recovery on standard
measures of policy changes will be difficult. One way of dealing with this omitted variable bias
is to use the “narrative approach” employed by Romer and Romer (2010) and Ramey and
Shapiro (1998). Our narrative approach involves using news reports and government
announcements to identify policy and financial market shocks in the US and Europe over the

2

period 2008-2012. We then use forecast revisions of economic growth to link high frequency
data with the recovery narrative.
Our narrative data come from financial media reports (in the Wall Street Journal and the
Financial Times) and policy announcements provided on US and European government websites
(Federal Reserve Bank sites, US Treasury, ECB and the European Commission). We include
financial market news (e.g. June 1, 2009: General Motors declares bankruptcy) as well as
announcements of US and European policy changes (e.g. February 17, 2009: American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 signed into law; May 3, 2010: ECB announces that it
will accept Greek sovereign debt as collateral no matter the country's rating).

Table 1 aggregates our narrative data across years and between the US and Europe. It
documents a shift in the location of the crisis: Both policy and market news are predominantly
coming from the US in 2009, while European shocks dominate our data in 2010-12. The
appendix provides the detailed events that underlie the counts in Table 1.
II. Forecast and Forecast Revisions
Given that the Great Recession is a singular event in post-Great Depression US time
series, econometric techniques have limited applicability for addressing the issues in this paper.
This section presents evidence based on forecasts of economists in the private sector and at the

3

International Monetary Fund (IMF). Our analysis thus aggregates the implicit and explicit
models of forecasters.
We examine the US Survey of Professional Forecasters maintained by the Philadelphia
Fed, the Eurozone Survey of Professional Forecasters maintained by the European Central Bank
(ECB), and the IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO) forecasts. The SPFs are surveys—mainly
of economists in the private sector. They have the advantage of aggregating the wisdom and
information of a wide range of professionals. The WEO forecasts necessarily reflect the IMF’s
modeling and institutional perspective. For our purposes, the WEO provides a convenient way
to get forecasts of individual countries based on similar models and with consistent timing.
We focus on real GDP forecasts. Unemployment is a lagging indicator, so is not as
suitable for an analysis of revisions of forecasts in response to news. Inflation is interesting over
this period—mainly because it moved so little despite the huge swings in real activity and
economic policy. Aside from noting the importance of inflation as a “dog that did not bark”
during this period, we leave analysis of it aside.
A. Forecasting the Recovery
We use the US Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) to provide a chronology of the
revisions of the economic outlook during the recovery from the Great Recession. Figure 1 shows
actual real GDP from 2007:1 to 2012:3 (solid line) and the mean eight-quarter ahead forecast for
the level of real GDP for each quarter beginning at the trough of the recession in 2009:2 (dotted
lines).2 The shaded area indicates the dates of the recession as determined by the NBER.
Important facts about the Great Recession and the subsequent recovery emerge from
Figure 1. First, the pre-peak trend path can be extrapolated from the path of GDP in 2007.
Actual GDP remains far below this trend path, as do forecasts of GDP through 2014. Unlike the
recessions of the 1950s through 1980s, where output grew at a faster than trend rate following
the peak, in the recovery from the Great Recession, growth has been at trend rate or lower. The
slow post-trough growth rate is embodied in the forecasts shown in Figure 1 both immediately

2

Actual GDP data in Figure 1 are revised as of mid-December 2012. The SPF forecasts are made shortly after the preliminary release of data
for the previous quarter. The SPFs provide forecasts for the level of the current and next four quarters and the current and next three years. To
obtain the quarterly forecasts five to eight quarters ahead, we find constant quarterly percent changes consistent with the reported annual
averages. The path of the level of the GDP forecast is adjusted up or down from the revised data by the “nowcast” error, measured based on the
percentage difference from the “forecast” of the current quarter contemporaneous with the forecast and the preliminary announcement of that
quarters’ data.

4

after the trough and on an ongoing basis. In this regard, the Great Recession parallels the Great
Depression. GDP did not get back to the pre-1929 trend path until the early 1940s. Nowhere in
the forecast horizon since the 2009 trough have forecasters projected a return to the pre-Great
Recession trend path. In this regard, the recessions since the 1980s are similar. Like 2009, the
1991 and 2001 troughs were followed by recoveries with average growth rather than a rapid
return to the previous trend path.

FIGURE 1. US REAL GDP: ACTUAL AND SPF FORECAST
Second, compounding the slow forecasted recovery that began in 2009, Figure 1 shows a
series of unfavorable revisions of the outlook beginning in 2010. The forecasts shift unfavorably
in 2010, 2011, and 2012, both in downward shifts of the trend path and, especially in 2012, a
downward revision of the growth rate.

B. Forecast Revisions: A Slow Recovery Gets Even Slower
Thus, four years beyond the trough of the Great Recession, there have been a series of
growth adjustments that were disappointing even relative to the forecasts of slow growth in
2009. The concomitance of the financial/fiscal shocks in Europe beginning in 2010 and the
changes in US economic outlook suggest an important role of the unresolved financial problems
in Europe damping the US recovery over several years. In this section of the paper, we develop
that argument by examining how forecast revisions in the Eurozone outlook relate to the bad
news for growth in the United States.

FIGURE 2. US AND EUROZONE REAL GDP: 1-YEAR-AHEAD SPF FORECASTS
Figure 2 shows the quarterly sequence of 4-quarter-ahead forecasts for US and Eurozone
GDP growth. The dark bars on the left are the mean US SPF forecast; the light bars on the right
are the Eurozone SPF forecast. The outlook for the US and the Eurozone deteriorated in tandem
in 2007 and 2008. The trough in the outlook in the Eurozone came several quarters later in 2009.
As shown from a slightly different perspective in Figure 1, the US recovery slowed in the second
half of three successive years—2010, 2011, and 2012—with the biggest step-down in growth in

6

2011. These changes in the outlook coincide with the increased prevalence of negative Eurozone
shocks described in the narrative. There is a slight revision downward in the Eurozone forecast
in 2010. The big step-down comes in 2011.3 What underlies this timing is that, although it was
evident that smaller Eurozone countries faced serious financial/fiscal problems beginning in the
summer of 2010, it was not until the 2011 Eurozone-wide crisis that the outlook for the larger
countries, notably Germany, was revised down.
The protracted impasse over the federal debt ceiling beginning in mid-2011 is a prime
suspect in explaining the step-down in the trajectory of the US economic outlook. It is swamped
by news from Europe in the counts of Table 1, but it was surely big news. We conjecture that the
impact of the US fiscal impasse was magnified by its arrival at the same time as the growing
understanding of Europe’s financial/fiscal problems.

That is, it appeared that the US was

volunteering to participate in a crisis that was building momentum in Europe.

Table 2 documents the timing of the growth shock internationally.

It presents the

revision in the two-year ahead cumulative (not annual rate) outlook for real GDP from the IMF
WEO. The WEO forecasts are made in the second and fourth quarter of the year, so the table
reflects news that arrived over the summer of each year.4 The revisions in the IMF outlook for

3

The precise timing should be interpreted with caution. Though the forecasts are made at roughly the same time, the Eurozone GDP data are
available with a greater lag than the US GDP data. Hence, a US lead over the Eurozone at the one-quarter horizon can be due to data availability
as well as the timing of underlying news.
4
That the IMF forecasts get revised between the second and fourth quarter is convenient for analyzing the Eurozone crises of 2010 through
2012 where much news happened to come out over the summer. Note, however, that Table 2 does not reflect all cumulative news, since forecast

7

the US tell a similar story to SPF’s. In 2009, there was news that the recovery of growth was
underway. There was a modest revision down in 2010 and 2012, but the big news came in the
downward revision over 2011. The WEO forecasts show why the slowdown in the Eurozone
overall only took hold in 2011. While the smaller countries facing financial distress beginning in
2010 (e.g. Greece) had growth revised down at that point, it was not until 2011 that Germany,
and therefore the Eurozone overall, started to slow. The U.K. started to slow earlier, and had
downward revisions in each of 2010, 2011, and 2012.
Table 2 also includes data for the two largest Asian economies. In the 2010-2011 period,
Japan was not particularly in sync with the other countries discussed, though hardly providing
any good news. China’s growth slowdown is milder than Europe’s, but forecast revisions are
increasingly negative over the three years.
III. Discussion
The recovery from the trough of the Great Recession has been very slow. Unlike other
deep post-World War II recessions such as that of 1982, there has been no period of rapid growth
that has gotten the economy back to the pre-recession trend path. Four years after the trough, the
economy remains about as far below the trend path as it was at the trough. This slow growth did
not come as a surprise to forecasters, who on average projected slow growth from the start of the
recovery. Strong headwinds—including the continuing effects of the decline in housing prices,
deleveraging of households, the financial sector, and non-financial businesses, and fiscal
contraction at the state and local level—all weighed against growth.5 The recoveries beginning in
1991 and 2001, though they followed much less sharp declines in activities, were similar to the
experience beginning in 2009. Post-recession growth was no faster than the average rate.
Except for a brief period at the end of 2009, economic growth during the recovery has
been disappointingly slow. In the course of 2010, 2011, and 2012, there was bad news for the
trajectory of US GDP. The news was especially bad in 2011. This paper documents this news
by examining revisions in forecasts for GDP growth.

It uses a narrative of news about

financial/fiscal issues in the US and Europe to provide a circumstantial account of the sources of
revisions from the fourth quarter to the second quarter of the following year are not reflected in the table. It would be difficult to do so based on
published tables because the horizon of the forecasts also shifts over this interval.
5
We are grateful to Allen Sinai for highlighting these factors in his discussion. Sinai (2008) discusses them in anticipation of the end of the
previous expansion. Sinai (2010) emphasizes the importance of financial factors in explaining recent business cycles and particularly how they
magnify the effects of other channels that propagate the business cycle internationally.

8

the revisions. News documented in our narrative timeline and forecast revisions during the
recovery from the Great Recession suggest that successive financial/fiscal shocks emanating
from Europe together with self-inflicted wounds from the political stalemate over the US fiscal
situation help explain the slowing of the pace of an already slow recovery.
The negative news from Europe seems to have magnified home-grown concerns about
the ability of US policymakers to resolve the fiscal impasse. Implicitly using the models of
forecasters rather than specifying one explicitly, we are capturing the collective wisdom about
the likely magnitudes of these channels. Since countries like Greece and Spain are small relative
to the world, it suggests that there are more to linkages than can be attributed to trade flows. On
the other hand, small-country financial crises can be contained. The examples of Iceland and
Ireland come to mind. Coming earlier in the crisis, before the understanding of the depth of the
financial/fiscal issues in the Eurozone and also the US, they did not cause downward revisions in
the global outlook.
So is this time different? The slow pace of the projected path of GDP from the trough
has been a feature of US recoveries since the 1990s, though the depth of the 2009 trough was of
course unique in post-Great Depression experience. The halting recovery—coming from the
continued unfolding of joint financial/fiscal crises internationally—has made the recovery from
the Great Recession even slower than initially expected.
