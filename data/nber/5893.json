    "abstract": "\n\nIn recent years a number of industrialized countries have adopted a strategy for monetary policy known as `inflation targeting.' We describe how this approach has been implemented in practice and argue that it is best understood as a broad framework for policy, which allows the central bank `constrained discretion,' rather than as an ironclad policy rule in the Friedman sense.  We discuss the potential of the inflation-targeting approach for making monetary policy more coherent and transparent, and for increasing monetary policy discipline.  Our final section addresses some additional practical issues raised by this approach.\n\n",
