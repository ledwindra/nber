    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper develops a political-economic model of fiscal policy - one in which government resources are a  common property' out of which interest groups can finance expenditures on their preferred items.  This setup has striking macroeconomic implications.  Transfers are higher than a benevolent planner would choose; fiscal deficits emerge even when there are no reasons for intertemporal smoothing, and in the long run government debt tends to be excessively high; peculiar time profiles for transfers can emerge, with high positive net transfers early on giving way to high taxes later on; and multiple dynamic equilibrium paths can occur starting at the same initial level of government debt.\n\n",
