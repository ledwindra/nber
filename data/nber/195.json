    "abstract": "\n\nA brief discussion of recent methods using the Hat Matrix for identifying leverage points, and clustering techniques for finding groups of data points is presented. The problem of identifying leverage groups is addressed, and a heuristic algorithm for identifying both leverage points and leverage groups is proposed. Semi-portable FORTRAN code implementing the algorithm, a sample terminal session, and a discussion of the terminal session are included.\n\n",
