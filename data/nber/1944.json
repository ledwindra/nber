    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper is a theoretical investigation of international lending and\nborrowing in the context of a general equilibrium model in which national\nproductivities are subject to random fluctuations and rates of time\npreference differ among countries. International capital flows arise from\nthe efforts of risk-averse households situated in different countries to\nself-insure against random productivity fluctuations. We establish the\nexistence of a rational expectations equilibrium in which the world\ninterest rate is constant and strictly less than the rate of time\npreference of the least impatient countries. The rate of time preference,\nsolvency restrictions on borrowing, and balanced-budget fiscal policies are\nrigorously analyzed.\n\n",
