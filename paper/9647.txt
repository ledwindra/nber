ABSTRACT
This paper provides an in-depth review and analysis of household portfolios in Japan. (1) Using both
aggregate and disaggregate data, it is shown that the shares of equities in household financial wealth
have been decreasing throughout the 1990s. Stock market participations of Japanese households also
have declined in the last decade. This is in sharp contrast to the U.S. and European countries in
which increasing trends in household stock holdings are observed. (2) Using survey data, age-related
variation in stock shares in financial wealth is analyzed. Equity shares in financial wealth increases
with age among young households, peaking in the fifties age group, then becoming constant. This
peak comes in a much later stage of the life-cycle compared to other countries. Stock market
participation varies in a way very similar to unconditional equity shares, while equity shares
conditional on ownership exhibit no significant age-related pattern. This implies the age-related
patterns are mostly explained by the decision to hold or not to hold stocks at all. Such a mechanism
is the same as previous studies reporting about western countries. (3) Owner-occupied housing has
significantly positive effect on stock market participation and stock shares in financial wealth. This
suggests that the age-related pattern observed in stock holding cannot be analyzed separately from
household's tenure choice of housing. Therefore any serious attempt at modeling Japanese
households' dynamic portfolio choice should incorporate the effect of housing tenure choice.

Introduction

This paper provides an in-depth review and analysis of household portfolios in Japan.
Recently many empirical studies have been conducted about household portfolios in
United States and European countries. Those studies include Amerkis and Zeldes
(2001), Bodie and Crane (1997), and Poterba and Samwick (1995, 1997), and the
chapters in Guiso, Haliassos, and Jappelli (2001). However, very little has been done
about non-western countries in current literature.
Since there already exist a large number of studies on the same subject about other
countries, here, I motivate the analyses of this paper paying attentions to the points
particularly important to Japan. First, Japan is an aging economy just like other
OECD countries. However, Japan will experience one of the fastest aging process
around the world unless we observe mass immigration in the near future. The potential
e®ects of the aging of the population on the level of Japan's national saving and its
social security system have drawn the attention of both academics and policy-makers.
However, how households allocate their accumulated wealth across di®erent assets has
attracted less attention, even though the welfare of households depends on the riskiness
of their portfolios as well as on the total wealth level. At a more practical level, how
individuals allocate their portfolios is relevant to the debate concerning the de¯ned
contribution pension plan that allows participants some discretion in their investment
choices.
Second, the way Japanese households allocate their wealth and how it will change
are very important for understanding the ongoing structural change in the Japanese
¯nancial system, the Japanese Big Bang. Many macro and ¯nancial economists view
that the bubble economy in the second half of the 1980s and the prolonged economic
and ¯nancial turmoil since the early 1990s have been intimately related to the structural change in the Japanese ¯nancial system | a shift from a bank-oriented system to
a market-oriented system1 . In previous studies, changing corporate ¯nancing decisions
and corporate governance have been the main focus of analysis. However, in consideration of general equilibrium, if the way ¯rms raise funds for their business (i.e., the
1 Hoshi

and Kahsyap (2001) forcefully made this point.

1

supply structure of ¯nancial assets) changes, the way households allocate their funds
(the demand structure of ¯nancial assets) must also change. Therefore, studying the
portfolio structure of Japanese households is essential for understanding the changing
Japanese ¯nancial system as a whole. In particular, in the latter half of this paper, I
¯nd that equity share in ¯nancial wealth of Japanese households apparently peaks at
the latter stage of their life cycle compared with U.S. households. I will argue that this
¯nding suggests that Japanese households' demand for risky ¯nancial assets is crowded
out after they purchase homes, because they have already taken very risky positions
by taking out a large amount of housing loans. In that sense, structural impediments
in the Japanese land/housing problem, such as high land prices and the limited supply
of family-size rented housing, are generating ine±ciencies in ¯nancial markets too.
Although some important previous studies on the asset allocation of Japanese
households (e.g. Noland 1988; Muramoto eds. 1998) exist, they emphasized the
uniqueness of the Japanese household portfolio or the structural change of the investment behavior before and after the bubble from a microeconomic point of view.
The motivation of this paper is much more macro-oriented.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, I describe and
compare the alternative data and discuss general aspect of the Japanese households'
asset allocation. In section 3, I investigate the relationship between age and portfolio
choice of Japanese households. Section 4 extends the analysis in section 3 to the case
in which the household decision about ownership of housing is included. Section 5 is
the conclusion.

Asset Allocation by Japanese Households

In this section, I summarize numbers about Japanese households asset allocation
from three di®erent data sources, one aggregate and two disaggregate/survey data
of Japanese household portfolios. The aggregate data is tabulated from the Bank of
Japan's Flow of Funds account. One of the disaggregate data is the survey data conducted by Central Council for Savings Promotion, the Bank of Japan and is available
from its website. However, only aggregate numbers are publicly available for now.
2

The second survey data is the annual survey data published by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, which is known as Nikkei Radar2. It contains information about households' portfolio allocation and characteristic such as age, income, and occupation. But, Nikkei
data has various limitations. First, the observations are regionally limited to the Tokyo
metropolitan area and surrounding prefectures3 . Regional bias is likely to make the
sample average younger than the nation-wide average. For the same reason, there
might be a bias in occupation and/or in income level. The sample contains too little
agricultural workers, and the average income level is higher than the nation-wide average. Finally, Nikkei data are pooled cross-section data. So various interesting analyses
that panel data structure would allow us to conduct cannot be examined.
To provide basic ideas about what has been going on with the Japanese economy
in our sample period, Figure 1 shows broad trends in Japanese macro and ¯nancial
variables. In last three years in the 1980s and ¯rst two years in the 1990s, growth rate
of real GDP in Japan were as high as 4% on average. Then from 1992, Japan has
been trapped in the prolonged recession for a decade. There were slight recoveries in
1996 and 2000, but output growth rate has been about 1% on average. In°ation rate
followed a similar path lagging little behind GDP growth. De°ation was ¯rst recorded
in 1995 and 1996 for GDP de°ator. However, this time, rapid increase in yen's value
and decrease of import goods prices in 1995 are behind de°ation and CPI in°ation did
not turn negative in 1995 and 1996. On the other hand, the de°ation since 1999 has
been persistent and a serious economy-wide phenomena.

[Insert Figure 1 here]

Short-term interest rate peaked in late 1989 and in the ¯rst half of 1990, when the
Bank of Japan tried to bring asset prices down to \normal" level. After real economy
had slowed down, short-term rate was cut, eventually brought down to zero in 1995,
and has been at that level since then. The long-rate also slowly converged toward
short-rate though the second half of the 1990s. If one draw the yield curve, it gets

°atter and °atter in the second half of the 1990s. It is not too di±cult to imagine that
in°ation expectation by public got lower and lower in this period.
Stock prices tripled from 1985 to the end of 1989, then it halved in next couple
of years and have stayed around at that level since 1994. Real estate prices followed
stock prices with a lag of twelve to eighteen months and peaked in 1990 or early 1991,
then went down throughout the 1990s to the level of 1985. By all respects, this has
been one of the most dramatic tales of asset price °uctuation in economic history.
Table 1 through 3 summarize household portfolio data from three di®erent sources.
In Table 1, the survey data by the Bank of Japan are reported. The ¯rst three items
are the levels of ¯nancial wealth measured in 1999 yen value (ten-thousand yen). In
1999, average ¯nancial asset per household is 14,791 thousand yen, median assets 9,397
thousand yen, and average net ¯nancial worth is 9,686 thousand yen. Assuming the
exchange rate of 125 yen per dollar, ¯nancial asset in 1999 roughly corresponds to 120
thousand US dollar, median asset is 75 thousand dollar, and average net-worth is 77
thousand dollar.
Items below are the shares of particular ¯nancial assets in total ¯nancial wealth. If
we look at deposits, their share had been nearly 70% at the beginning of the 1980s and
then declined throughout the 1980s to less than a half of total assets in 1990. Then
deposit regained their share throughout the 1990s, back to 60%, about the level of
the mid-1980s. On the other hand, the share of stocks followed a completely opposite
pattern. It peaked at 1990, at little more than 10%. Then it has been declining
throughout the 1990s. These patterns are consistent with Japanese macroeconomic
conditions in this period. Households increased the share of risky assets in booms and
cut it in recessions.
[Insert Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3 here]
Table 2 shows aggregate ¯gures from the °ow of funds data of the Bank of Japan.
In this table, we only have the data from the 1990s so that it corresponds to the righthand side half of Table 1. As in Table 1, deposits keep increasing its share. On the
4

other hand equity share has been decreasing except in 1999, which corresponds to the
time of a small bubble on the IT related stocks in 1999 and early year 2000.
Table 3 is the Nikkei's survey data, which I am going to use extensively in the
following sections. It seems like this data is more sensitive to market valuation or
perhaps oversensitive to it. In the other two data, average ¯nancial wealth of Japanese
households have increased mildly throughout the 1990s. In Nikkei's data, it remains
almost constant since 1993. Average total wealth, which is de¯ned as the sum of
¯nancial wealth and real estates, moves more dramatically. It increased about ¯fteen
percent in the late 1980s. Then, from 1990 to 1999, it declined to less than a half of
1990 value. This °uctuation apparently re°ects the movement in real estate prices.
On the other hand equity share moved, but we see no obvious trend in Nikkei data.
Several items in these tables need careful explanations. First, life insurance, in
addition to its original role as insurance, has been an extremely popular form of savings
in Japan. Insurance companies assured customers to payout certain amounts at the
maturity of insurance. The rate of return for this payout was pre-committed and
¯xed, so that life insurance company can invest that money in their discretions until
maturity. Excess returns are their pro¯ts. Combined with high private saving rate,
this is why Japanese insurance companies have been signi¯cant institutional investors
around the world. However, many insurance contracts made during the years of the
bubble economy, are now close to their maturities. Since asset returns in the 1990s have
been so low, excess returns are mostly negative and now many Japanese life insurance
companies are in a serious trouble. This is also the reason Nikkei data asked about
the value of life insurance at its maturity. Hence, the importance of life insurance in
the Nikkei data is overly exaggerated. Since the numbers of \personal pension plus
life insurance" are similar in aggregate data and the Bank of Japan survey, they are
more reliable for the value of life insurance. So In Table 3, I also report the values
of ¯nancial wealth excluding life insurance (Panel B) and corrected for life insurance
values (Panel C).
Another item that requires explanation is trust funds. Trust funds in these tables
include assets managed by trust banks and bonds issued by three long-term credit
5

banks. Since two of the long-term credit banks disappeared in the late 1990s and the
last one was also merged in 2002, the supply of this type of asset ceased to exist. This
explains clear declining trend in trust funds.
Overall, evidence in Table 1 though 3 clearly suggests that equity share in Japanese
households ¯nancial wealth had increased in the second half of the 1980s, peaked in
around 1990, and then kept declining throughout the 1990s. A similar pattern is
observed about the population of households participating in the stock market. Table
4 looks at stock market participation by Japanese households, along with ownership of
real estates4. Again, it peaked in 1990 and declined throughout the 1990s. This is in
clear contrast with U.S. and European countries in which stock market participation
shows a clear increasing trend in the last decade (Guiso, Haliassos, and Jappelli, 2002).
The share of mutual funds has also decreased throughout the 1990s. Once again,
compared with increasing popularity of mutual funds in the U.S. in the 1990s, this
might seem surprising. However, to those who are familiar with the Japanese ¯nancial
markets, it is a well-known fact that Japanese mutual fund business has been su®ering
from very poor performance and sloppy management (Cai, Chan, and Yamada, 1997).

[Insert Table 4 here]

Small shares of equity in households wealth around 1990 are also surprising. At the
peak of the bubble economy, the capitalization of the Japanese stock market exceeded
that of the U.S. for one time. However, nowhere in the data we investigating here
we can trace such a prosperity in household wealth. The share of equity in wealth
certainly increased and peaked at around 1990, but neither the increase before the
peak nor the subsequent decline are large enough to be consistent with the size of
stock market's swing from the late 1980s to the early 1990s. The most promising
explanation for this fact is that, as discussed in French and Poterba (1999), a large
fraction of Japanese companies' stocks have been held by other ¯rms, in the form
4

Our categorization of equities corresponds to households owning equities through \direct + mutual
funds" or \direct + mutual funds+trusts" in Amerkis and Zeldes (2001). The reported ¯gures for
U.S. are 22.3% and 24.7%.

of cross-holding. However, more detailed investigation is needed to provide a full
explanation of such a small impact of stock prices on household wealth.

Financial Portfolio Choice over the Life Cycle by
Japanese households

In this section, we look at the age-related pattern of stockholding by Japanese households. First, I brie°y discuss what theory might predict about the age-related pattern
about portfolio shares and empirical ¯ndings about other countries.
The classical (Samuelson-Merton) life-cycle portfolio theory suggests that there will
be no age e®ects and the share invested in stocks should be constant over the life-cycle.
Consumers are \myopic" and replicate the static portfolio allocation independently of
their investment horizon. This result follows from various assumptions: preferences
are CRRA; either constant investment opportunities or log utility has to be assumed;
there is only ¯nancial wealth and no non-tradable human capital.
On the other hand, popular recommendations from ¯nancial planners are in sharp
contrast to theoretical predictions. Long-term investors, the young households with
long-horizon, should take riskier investment positions and invest in stocks to take
advantage of equity premium. Their equity share should decline with age so that
age-portfolio pro¯le is downward-sloping.
Amerkis and Zeldes (2001) summarized empirical ¯ndings about U.S. data as follows:
(1) Unconditional equity shares in ¯nancial assets have a hump-shaped pattern with
age, peaking in the late forties and ¯fties for households.
(2) The proportion of population owning equity displays a hump-shaped pattern with
age.
(3) Equity shares in ¯nancial assets conditional on ownership are mostly constant with
age.
7

So the age-related pattern is explained mostly by the decision to own or not to own
stocks at all. These patterns contradict both the classical \myopic" portfolio theory
and the ¯nancial planners advises. However, they seem to be a global phenomena |
the same pattern is observed for European countries, as reported in Guiso, Haliassos,
and Jappelli (2001).
What about Japan? It turns out Japanese data also goes along with the global
trend. The ownership of equity is hump-shaped and share in stock among stock holders
is °at over the life-cycle. Thus, the life-cycle pattern of stock share mostly comes from
market participation. Figure 2 shows the variation of equity shares in ¯nancial assets
over the life cycle. Both panels present the same features. In the panel titled \Crosssection view," the observations for the same year are connected by lines. In the panel
titled \Cohort view," the same cohorts are tracked over the years. We are interested
in the age-related pattern and cannot distinguish between the age e®ect, the cohort
e®ect, and the year e®ect5. From the \Cohort view" panel, it is obvious that all cohorts
recorded the largest shares of equities in their ¯nancial wealth in 1990, at the peak
of the bubble economy. The age-related pattern is more stable from the cross-section
view of the data. This suggests that it is more appropriate to ignore the cohort e®ect
and include the year e®ect. Hence we focus on the cross section view of the data in
the following discussion.

[Insert Figure 2 here]

In the last panel of Figure 2, the age-related pattern of equity shares for 1999 using
di®erent de¯nitions of \¯nancial wealth" is shown. As we noted in the previous section,
Nikkei Radar data have been asking households about the amount of insurances in the
survey. The inclusion of insurances increased the total ¯nancial wealth up to 50%.
The equity share in ¯nancial assets including life insurance and non-life insurance is
represented by the dotted line in the last panel of Figure 2. Basically, the inclusion of
insurance did not change the age-related pattern of equity shares in ¯nancial wealth
5 See

Amerkis and Zeldes (2001) for details of this identi¯cation problem.

8

and real estate holdings in total wealth. So we adopt a narrower de¯nition of ¯nancial
wealth without insurance in the following.
Figure 3 shows the proportion of population that owns stocks and it varies with
age just like equity shares. On the other hand, in Figure 4, we observe no signi¯cant
age-related pattern in equity shares conditional on equity holding. Hence if we break
down the age-related pattern of equity shares, we see that a large portion of the agerelated pattern is due to the decision to own or not to own stocks at all. Overall, the
source of the age-related pattern in equity shares is exactly same as that Amerkis and
Zeldes (2001) found in U.S. data.
[Figure 3 and Figure 4 about here]
While Japanese and U.S. households seem to behave very similarly, Japanese equity shares and stock market participation do not decrease even after retirement age.
This is clearly di®erent from the U.S. case in which equity share peaks in the late
forties to ¯fties in terms of household age. However, it is also well-known fact that
Japanese households do not stop saving even after retirement. Unfortunately, Nikkei
data has very few observations of households over age 65. Detailed investigation of
elders portfolio choice has to be left for future research.

Financial Portfolio Choice and Owner-occupied
Housing

It is well known that for average Japanese households, their most important asset
is their real estates. For example, according to Noguchi and Poterba (1994b), the
average house price to average annual income ratio is 7.4 for Japanese households
and 3.2 for U.S. in 1989. These numbers °uctuate, but on average, the amount that
Japanese households spend on their owner-occupied house is about twice that of U.S.
households. Therefore, if one wants to consider the portfolio decision of Japanese
households in earnest, it is necessary to explore their decision to hold or not to hold
real estate, especially owner-occupied houses.
9

4.1

Background of Japanese Housing and Land Price Problem

Before getting into the analysis, ¯rst, I explain the background of the Japanese land
price/housing problem in more detail. There are many important structural factors
that explain why renting houses is not an attractive alternative for Japanese households. A couple of those factors which I believe are most important will be discussed
in this section6.
The biggest structural problem preventing Japanese households from renting houses
is the shortage of quality rented housing. A general consensus is that Japanese land
and housing laws (Shakuchi Ho and Shayakuya Ho) have contributed to this problem.
Japanese real estate laws take the side of tenants and are very protective towards their
rights. It is therefore di±cult for landlords to raise rents and even more di±cult for
them to remove tenants. Such overprotection of tenants makes land owners afraid of
large investments that might turn sour and of re-development of old existing rented
houses. As a result, the supply of rented housing in Japan is limited and the quality of
this supply is worse than owner-occupied houses. Owners of real estate prefer students
and young singles who change residences frequently. According to the international
comparison by Yamazaki (1999), while the average size of owner-occupied houses is
almost the same in Japan, France, and Germany, the average size of rented houses in
Japan is only two-thirds of those in Europe7 . This means that the supply of large size
houses, especially those for families with children, is extremely limited in Japan.
The overprotection of tenants in the Japanese legal system has been already pointed
out as a structural impediment causing the ine±cient use of land resources in Japan and
raising real estate prices. The point that I would like to make here is that the ine±ciencies in the Japanese housing market limit the supply of quality rented housing, forcing
households to hold a very large share of their assets in the form of owner-occupied
housing and to take risky positions in their portfolios. Therefore, the willingness of
6

For a comprehensive discussion of this issue, see Ito (1994) and, especially, Yamazaki (1999).
Yamazaki (1999) reports that average size of owner-occupied houses is 122:1m 2 in: Japan,
101:4m2 in France, and 112:7m 2 in Germany. On the other hand, the average size of rented houses
is 45:1m 2 in Japan, 68:1m 2 in France, and 69:2m 2 in Germany.

households to take risky positions in the ¯nancial market is intimately related to their
positions in the housing market.
Another important issue is the bequest tax. The inheritance tax burden in Japan
is much heavier than in the United States and most developed economies. At the same
time, if one plans a bequest, it is preferable, from the standpoint of saving taxes, to
hold real estate rather than ¯nancial wealth. This is because ¯nancial assets have been
evaluated at market value and real estate has historically been evaluated below market
value in the assessment for bequest taxes until the early 1990s. So there is a strong
tax incentive for Japanese households to hold real estate and take out housing loans,
since the latter is tax deductible at market value if one is to carry out a bequest. Also,
for residential real estate, there are huge tax deductions in general. Since there is a
fairly solid consensus on strong bequest motives among Japanese8, such a tax system
explains why Japanese households prefer to hold owner-occupied houses rather than
rent houses. It also helps to explain why the elderly in Japan retain houses and other
real estate until their death.

4.2

Age, Equity Share, and Owner-occupied Housing

When the ownership of real estate is taken into account, the following trends in the
relationship between home ownership and age are observed for Japanese households:
(i) Real estate shares in total wealth (de¯ned as the sum of ¯nancial assets and real
estate) increase with age, but become almost constant after the mid-¯fties.
(ii) The fraction of population owning real estate increases with age, but becomes almost
constant after the mid-¯fties.
(iii) The shares of real estate in total wealth conditional on ownership of real estate
decrease with age. Conditional on ownership, real estates account for about 70 to 90
percent of households' total assets.
(i)-(iii) suggest that exactly the same mechanism is creating the age-related pattern of
real estate shares in total wealth as that of equity shares in ¯nancial wealth. Virtually
8

See Horioka and Watanabe (1997).

11

all of the age-related patterns are due to the decision to own or not to own real estate.
Furthermore, equity shares in ¯nancial wealth and real estate shares in total wealth
exhibit very similar life cycle patterns, peaking at the age of ¯fties and showing no
signi¯cant decline after that. One noteworthy point is that total wealth here is gross
total wealth rather than net wealth. Since the majority of the households take out
housing loans when they purchase a house, the net worth of home owners, especially
among young households, is much smaller than the \total wealth" reported here.
When equity holdings of real estate holders and non-holders are considered separately, the following are observed.
(iv) Conditional on ownership of real estate, equities accounts for less than 5 percent
of total wealth and around 10 percent of ¯nancial wealth. Both shares increase with
age.
(v) Conditional on that households do NOT own real estate at all, no signi¯cant agerelated pattern is observed for equity holdings. On average, equities make up about 5
percent of total wealth (which is equal to ¯nancial wealth in this case).
Our ¯ndings concerning the relationship between stock and real estate holdings can
be summarized as follows. First, the age-related patterns are very similar for equity
shares in ¯nancial wealth (S/FW), real estate shares in total wealth (RE/TW), and
S/FW for those who own houses. However, no age-related patter is observed in S/FW
(equals to S/TW in this case) for those who do not own real estate. These ¯ndings
suggest that the demand for risky ¯nancial assets is strongly a®ected by the decision
to hold owner-occupied housing or not. Households that decide to purchase their
own houses have to accumulate ¯nancial wealth to prepare large down payments. If
the demand for owner-occupied housing is strong enough, this prevents risk-taking in
¯nancial investments at early stages of their lives. When they purchase a house, they
have to take leveraged positions by borrowing a large amount in housing loans. Again,
households cannot take risky positions in their ¯nancial portfolios until they pay back
substantial amounts of their housing loans and accumulate bu®er-stock savings in safe
assets. Only then, will they start stock investments. This is borne out also by the
fact that the peak of Japanese S/FW comes in a later stage of life than in the U.S.
12

and that RE/TW decreases with age for homeowners. It has been suggested that
high real estate prices and large down payments provide some explanation for the high
household saving rate in Japan (Hayashi, Ito, and Slemrod, 1988). The ¯ndings of
this paper suggest, in addition to the e®ect on the amount of savings pointed out by
Hayashi et.al., that high land prices and housing market imperfections very likely a®ect
the allocation of Japanese households' ¯nancial wealth. In particular, the demand for
risky ¯nancial assets, such as equities, might have been suppressed by the heavy burden
of housing loans borne by Japanese households.
In Figure 5, the exercise in Figure 2 to 4 is repeated for the real estate share in
total wealth. In Figure 5 (1), we ¯nd that real estate shares in total wealth increase
with age, but remain almost constant after the late ¯fties. Caplin, Chan, Freeman, and
Tracy (1997) presents the most comprehensive examination, to my knowledge, of home
ownership and real estate share within total wealth for U.S. households. According to
Caplin et.al. (1997, Figures 2.1-2.4; pp.22-24), the proportion of population owning
their own houses in the year 1990 peaks in the late ¯fties and sixties at around 70 %.
Therefore, in contrast to the case of the equity holding rate, the real estate ownership
rates in Japan and the U.S. follow a very similar age-related pattern.

[Figure 5 about here]

I found exactly the same pattern regarding the proportion of population owning
real estate in Figure 5 (2). In Figure 5 (3), the age-related pattern of real estate
share in total wealth steadily decreases with age, when real estate owners alone are
considered. So if we decompose the pattern of real estate share, the age-related pattern
can be completely explained by the decision to purchase or not to purchase real estate.
This mechanism is more evident for real estate shares than for equity shares. This
is not surprising since most households make the decision to buy real estate only a
few times in their lives and rarely own more than one piece of real estate at the
same time. After they purchase their living places, the accumulation of wealth takes
the form of ¯nancial assets. This explains why real estate shares decreases with age
for home-owners. However, an important assumption in interpreting Figure 5, three
13

graphs of real estate shares in total wealth, is that the de¯nition of total wealth here
corresponds to gross total wealth rather than the net worth of households. Since most
households take out housing loans when they buy their house, the denominator of the
real estate/total wealth ratio is smaller in the early stage of the life cycle. Therefore, if
we used net worth rather than gross wealth of households, the slope of the age-related
pattern would be °atter in Figure 5 (1). On the other hand, the ratio of real estate to
the net worth of households should decline more sharply than in Figure 5 (3).
Figures 6 through Figure 9 investigate the di®erence between equity shares of real
estate owners and of those who do not own any real estate. Figure 6, Figure 7, and
Figure 8 deal with equity shares in ¯nancial and total wealth of homeowners. Figure 6
plots real estate owners' equity shares in ¯nancial wealth and in total wealth. Although
less evident for equity share in ¯nancial wealth, both ¯gures are increasing with age.
Since the number of observations is much smaller than in the full sample, the lines
in these ¯gures are jagged. Figure 7 plots the proportion of stockholders among real
estate owners. It increases with age, just as in the full sample case in Figure 3. But,
the proportion of stockholders is higher among homeowners than in the full sample.

[Figure 6 and Figure 7 about here]

In Figure 8, equity shares in ¯nancial wealth and in total wealth among households
that hold both equities and real estates are shown. The equity shares in ¯nancial
wealth are almost constant with age, just as in the full sample containing both owners
and non-owners of real estates. However, the equity share in total wealth increases
with age. Once again, readers are reminded that total wealth in the second panel is
not net worth of households: it is gross total wealth. So the age-related pattern of
equity shares in ¯nancial assets (S/FW) is mostly explained by the decision to hold or
not to hold equity. Those who own stocks keep the ratio of S/FW mostly constant at
around 30-35%. Equity shares in total wealth (S/TW) increase with age, but this will
be less evident if we could use equity shares in net worth instead of S/TW here since
younger households must be taking out housing loans.

[Figure 8 about here]

Figure 9 describes the portfolio allocation of non-homeowners. Note that, for nonowners, ¯nancial wealth equals total wealth by de¯nition. According to Figure 9 (1),
equity consists of only about 5% and no clear age-related pattern is observed. Figure
9 (2) and (3) show the proportion of stockholders among non-homeowners and equity
shares in their portfolios. Again no age-related pattern is observed. The absence of
age-related patterns in Figure 9 suggests that the observed age-related pattern in stock
shares in ¯nancial wealth is largely a®ected by the decision to buy a house. First, a
household has to decide whether to own a house or not. Then, if it decide to buy a
home, it has to prepare large down payments and take out housing loans. Homeowners
will be able to accumulate risky ¯nancial assets mostly after the purchase of housing
and this causes the seemingly age-related pattern in S/FW. On the other hand, those
who decide not to own real estate begin to buy equities from the early stages of their
lives.

[Figure 9 about here]

Table 5 is looking at the same problem we have discussed from a di®erent perspective. Households are divided into groups by \if they hold stocks or not" and by \if
they own real estate or not." This produces four groups of households and they are
shown in two by two matrices. Panel (A) of Table 5 shows the transition of this matrix
over the life cycle using the cross-section data of 1999. The di®erence between the Age
30-32 group and the Age 39-41 group | the smaller matrix to the right of original
matrices | suggests that there is a signi¯cant population shift from the \no stock - no
land" group (a 25.2% decrease) to the \no stock - own land" group (a 19.3% increase)
during the age of thirties. This pattern is observed in a less pronounced way for the
di®erence between the Age 39-41 group and the Age 48-50 group, a 12.8% decrease and
a 5.3% increase respectively. Instead, the \own stock - own land" group increases by
10.5% during forties of age. Finally, the di®erence between the Age 48-50 group and
the Age 57-59 group exhibits a 4.2% decline of the \no stock - own land" group, while
15

the \own stock - own land" group continues to increase by 10.8%. Overall, analysis
of these matrices suggests that households start from the \no stock - no land" group,
move to the \no stock - own land" group ¯rst, then move to the \own both stock and
land" group.
Panels (B) and (C) of Table 5 are looking at the same problem using the cohort
data, tracking the Age 30-32 cohort and the Age 45-47 cohort in 1987. Basically, these
tables con¯rm what we observed about panel (A). Households ¯rst buy their houses
and then begin to buy stocks. The only di®erence from the cross-section data is that
the increase of the \own both" group is relatively limited for the older cohort. From
1987 to 1999, there was only a 4.6% increase in the \own both" group among the
cohort who had been Age 45-47 in 1987. Instead, we observe a 6.3% increase in \own
stock - no land" group in this cohort.

Econometric Analysis

To con¯rm the observations in the previous subsection, I ran regressions for stock
market participation and equity share in ¯nancial wealth. The results are reported in
Table 6. Explanatory variables include age, income, wealth, and their squared terms,
plus dummy variables for sex, marriage status, employment/job status (unemployed,
self-employed, agriculture) and owner-occupied housing (house). I used the two-stage
Heckman procedure, which is to use probit for stock market participation in the ¯rst
stage and include the correction term for sample selection in the regression for equity
shares in the second stage. Hence the ¯rst stage equation include the variables that are
supposed to a®ect participation. Here, they are a couple of regional dummies (Tokyo
and Ibaraki), credit card holding, and internet access at home.

[Table 6 about here]

16

In columns (1) and (2) of Table 6, where ¯nancial wealth is used as a wealth variable, age, income, and ¯nancial wealth are all a®ecting to stock market participation
signi¯cantly. College education also has a positive impact on stock ownership. These
parameter estimates are very similar whether or not the homeownership dummy is
included. The regression for equity shares is rather disappointing. Nothing but homeownership is signi¯cant. The wealth variable is total wealth in Table 6 (3) and is net
worth in Table 6 (4). Since total wealth and net worth include the value of real estates
owned by households, homeownership dummy is insigni¯cant to explain stock market
participation. However, owner-occupied housing is still signi¯cant in share equations
and parameter estimates are even higher than in (1) and (2) of Table 6. However, given
the same wealth level, homeownership signi¯cantly increases equity shares in ¯nancial
wealth by more than seven percent.

4.4

Discussion

The empirical ¯ndings in section 3 and section 4 can be summarized as follows. First,
with respect to both equity shares in ¯nancial wealth and real estate shares in total
wealth, we observe that the shares increase with age among young households, then
become constant. Equity shares might decrease in the late sixties and seventies of
age and have a hump shape, but there is no conclusive evidence due to limitation
of Japanese data. Second, for both equity shares in ¯nancial wealth and real estate
shares in total wealth, the age-related patterns are almost completely explained by the
decision to purchase or not to purchase stocks/real estate. Third, we do not observe
any signi¯cant age-related pattern in the equity holding of households that do not own
real estate. Also equity shares in total wealth increase with age for households that
own both equities and real estate, while real estate share in total wealth decreases with
age. These ¯ndings suggest that households become more willing to hold equities once
they purchased their homes.
What do these empirical ¯ndings suggest about theory? It is not di±cult to think
that we can construct a model with a combination of large indivisible investment
opportunity and loan market imperfection and will be able to explain some of the
features described in this section. For example, Hayashi, Ito, and Slemrod (1988)
17

presented such a model to explain some aspects of high Japanese private saving rate.
Using simulation, they showed that large down payments and heavy housing loans will
increase saving at younger stage of the life-cycle.
Recent paper by Faig and Shum (2002) is more directly related to the issues discussed in this paper. In their model, the households facing borrowing restrictions
also face investment opportunities (a house) that needs money at various stages (the
down payment, the purchase, maintenance, mortgage etc.) and is costly to liquidate.
Borrowing restrictions and project illiquidity generate a demand for self-¯nancing and
liquid assets. Since younger households are more likely to invest in those illiquid assets,
this can account for the hump-shape in stock holding. Faig and Shum test their model
with the U.S. SCF (Survey of Consumer Finances) data and ¯nd that the portfolio
share of liquid assets is higher for households with a high value of illiquid investment
(housing or private business). However, the remaining problem is that Faig and Shum's
story is about the share invested in stocks, not about ownership. Provided the risk
premium is positive, all household will hold stock in their model.
It seems very obvious that housing tenure decision heavily a®ects ¯nancial portfolio
decision9. It also seems that a model with a large indivisible investment opportunity
and capital market imperfection will provide a sensible explanation for what is happening. However, existing models are still unsatisfactory, in particular, in explaining the
fact that market participation is mostly responsible in generating age-related variation
in stock shares. Perhaps a model with some form of transaction costs is required to
explain the age-related pattern of household stock market participation.

Conclusions

This paper provided a general survey of household portfolios in Japan and analysis in
age-related variation of portfolio shares paying particular attention to its relationship
with real estate holdings. It is shown that both stock market participation by Japanese
households and the share of equities in their ¯nancial wealth have followed a declining
trend in the last decade. This is in sharp contrast to U.S. and European countries in
9

See Flavin and Yamashita (2002) and Yamashita (2002) for empirical evidence in U.S. data.

18

which increasing trends in household stock holdings are observed. It is also surprising
that large °uctuation in Japanese stock prices had such a tiny impact on the ¯nancial
wealth of the Japanese households.
About the age-related variation in stock holdings and stock shares, Japanese evidence clearly suggests that owner-occupied housing plays a very important role in their
determination. Homeownership has a signi¯cantly positive e®ect on stock market participation and stock shares in ¯nancial wealth. Younger households tend to accumulate
their wealth in safe assets to save for purchasing houses. After they purchase a house,
they restrained from taking risks in ¯nancial investments because of highly leveraged
positions from housing loans. So the demand for equity is more elastic to the wealth
level for homeowners than for non-owners. Such interpretation of the ¯ndings in this
paper is very intuitive and also potentially very important because, given the large
share of real estate in average Japanese households' total wealth, regulations and tax
policies related to the housing market might have a big impact on equity demand by
individual investors.
We are still lacking in a formal theoretical model that provides a satisfactory description of stock market participation and portfolio choice over the life-cycle. There
are a number of studies on dynamic portfolio choice between stocks and safe assets
with labor income risk (e.g. Bodie et.al. 1991; Campbell and Viceira 1991 and 2002)
and a limited number of studies on saving for purchasing owner-occupied housing with
labor income risk (e.g. Cocco 1999). However, at least to my knowledge, there is no
theoretical study that combine stock market, stock investment, and housing-tenure
decision at the same time. An important message I would like to convey in this paper
is the need for a model in which the choice of housing tenure and ¯nancial portfolio
choice are determined simultaneously.

Appendix: Nikkei Radar data

In this appendix, I summarize how the data set for graphical and econometric analysis
in the text was constructed from original Nikkei Radar data. The number of observations changes year by year, from 1,500 to 3,000. This is not a large number to form age
19

groups by a single year. If 2,000 households are distributed uniformly over ages from
twenty to seventy, each age/year contains only 40 observations. Since there are much
fewer observations for younger and older generations, following Amerkis and Zeldes
(2001), I constructed cohort data pooling for years. So, for example, the age 24 cohort
in the year 1987 contains households at ages of 24, 25 and 26. We took the years 1987,
1990, 1993, 1996, and 1999 to be the sample years to track the portfolio decisions by
cohort over time10. Even after we formed the age groups this way, youngest and oldest
age groups had too few observations. For this reason, I decided to drop households
under the age of 23 and over the age of 72 from the sample.
We group the assets into four categories | namely, safe assets, bonds, equities,
and real estate. We refer to the sum of the ¯rst three categories as ¯nancial assets or
¯nancial wealth. The sum of all four categories is called total wealth. The category
of bonds includes bond-only mutual funds. All mutual funds containing any stock
were included to the category of equities. The category of real estate consists mostly
of owner-occupied housing, but in some rare cases, it also includes other types of
real estate owned by households. Since the 1987 survey does not separate owneroccupied housing from other real estate, we have no choice other than to aggregate
di®erent real estates if we want to include data from the 1980s. After categorizing and
aggregating their assets, I excluded households that did not provide answers about
value or ownership of any one of the four asset categories. For example, those who
answered they have zero equities are included, but those who left a blank are excluded
from the sample. Such exclusions were made mostly in the categories of equities and
real estate. It is more than likely that this exclusion results in an underestimation of
stock and real estate shares in household portfolios. After all this, usable observations
stand at around 1,200 for 1987 and around 2,400 for 1990, 1993, 1996, and 1999.
The number of the observations used for econometric analysis in Table 6 is smaller
than used for graphical inspection, since many households did no responded to the
items that are used as explanatory variables.
10

The Nikkei Radar data start in the late 1970s, but the questions about real estate were only
asked from the 1986 survey.

Composition of Household Financial Wealth: Nikkei survey data

Note: In the survey question, Nikkei data asked about the value of life insurance at its
maturity, instead of current market value. As a result, life insurance values in Nikkei
data reported in Panel (A) are apparently overvalued compared with ones reported in
Table 1 and 2. For this reason, I calculated wealth level and asset shares in a couple of
additional ways. In Panel B, life insurance is simply excluded from ¯nancial wealth. In
panel C, I made an adjustment so that life insurance shares in ¯nancial wealth matches
to those reported in Table 1 and Table 2. Speci¯cally, I assumed the life insurance
share is 17.5% in 1987, 20% for 1990, 1992, 1996, and 1999, and then made adjustment
at the individual household level.
