ABSTRACT
Most interpretations of prevalent counterinsurgency theory imply that increasing government services
will reduce rebel violence. Empirically, however, development programs and economic activity sometimes
yield increased violence. Using new panel data on development spending in Iraq, we show that violence
reducing effects of aid are greater when (a) projects are small, (b) troop strength is high, and (c) professional
development expertise is available. These findings are consistent with a "hearts and minds" model,
which predicts that violence reduction will result when projects are secure, valued by community members,
and implementation is conditional on the behavior of non-combatants.

The economic analysis of civil wars and insurgencies has become a topic of growing
interest in both the academic and policy communities (Blattman and Miguel 2010;
World Development Report 2011). According to the 2011 World Development
Report (WDR), a billion and a half people live in countries affected by fragility,
conflict or violence, the last being a serious impediment to long‐run economic
development (WDR 2011).2 In those contexts, development programs are now often
tasked not only with improving human welfare and enabling development, but also
with helping local governments stabilize insecure environments (Berrebi and
Olmstead 2011).3
Most interpretations of prevailing counterinsurgency theory imply that
increasing the quantity or quality of government services will reduce violence (U.S.
Army 2007). Yet the opposite effect is also plausible: increased economic activity in
poorly controlled spaces might raise the returns to predatory violence, therefore
motivating even more violence (Hirshleifer 1989; Collier 2000). Both anecdotal and
empirical evidence are mixed. Sudden drops in aid flows correlate with increase
violence across countries (Nielsen et. al. 2011) and certain kinds of aid appear to be
violence reducing (Berman, Shapiro, and Felter 2011, hereafter BSF). Yet, exogenous
increases in economic activity have also been shown to lead to increased violence
against civilians (Vanden Eynde 2012, Berman et. al. 2012) and even development
programs sometimes yield increased violence, either by creating rents to capture or
by disturbing the distribution of power within communities (Crost, Felter, and
Johnston 2012a). The literature has so far not explored the question of optimal
development program design for violence‐reduction. As stable governments

The link between property rights, security, and long‐run growth in economics dates back
to at least the pioneering work of Douglass North (1981). Svensson (1998), for example,
extended North’s work by modeling the effects of political instability on property rights and,
in turn, on investment rates. Gradstein (2004) argues that the enforcement of property
rights and economic growth are self‐reinforcing. Guillaumont and Chauvet (2003 7‐10, 16)
find that aid effectiveness declines with political instability. Building on this and related
research, the WDR has emphasized the crucial role of improved governance in securing
people and property if growth is to be achieved (WDR 2001, 1).
3 For instance, USAID’s top ten benefiting countries in 2012 (obligations) were
Afghanistan ($2.2B), Pakistan (0.9B), Jordan (0.5B), Ethiopia (0.4B), Haiti, Kenya
and Iraq (0.3B each), DR Congo, Uganda and Tanzania (0.2B each) (USAID, 2013).

graduate out of the class of countries requiring development assistance, an
increasing share of aid will predictably be spent in fragile states, including conflict
and post‐conflict zones, so this gap in knowledge is deeply problematic.
In this paper we use detailed new data on development spending in Iraq to
begin closing that gap. Using panel data on development assistance and violent
incidents covering the first five years of the Iraq war, we compare the effects of U.S.
government spending across several development programs, each with different
characteristics. We are guided by the predictions of an information‐centric, or
“hearts and minds” theory of counterinsurgency in looking for characteristics of
effective development program design. We estimate in first differences allowing for
various controls to account for endogeneity and selection in the provision of
development assistance (BSF, Flores and Nooruddin, 2009).
Consistent with the theory’s predictions, we find that the violence reducing
effects of aid are greater when (a) individual projects are small, (b) troop strength is
high, and (c) professional development expertise is available. Controlling for the
presence of combat troops and Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRT), the small 9‐
15 person teams which provided development expertise to military units in Iraq, an
additional $50 per capita in spending on aid projects by military units through the
Commander’s Emergency Response Program (CERP) predicted about six less violent
incident per 100,000 residents over the course of a half‐year in the average district,
which is equivalent to the sample mean, or approximately half the sample median in
districts with ongoing fighting.4 For small CERP projects (<$50,000 in project
spending) that violence‐reducing effect is six times stronger (i.e., $8/capita to
reduce violence by the sample mean). In contrast, most other development
assistance programs, including those with large infrastructure projects, show no
evidence of violence‐reduction, with the exception of USAID’s small‐scale
Community Stabilization Program (CSP).
As predicted by the theory, small scale spending and force levels complement
each other; for every additional maneuver battalion (approx. 800 soldiers) present
These are observations (i.e., districts/half‐years) with nonzero measured
violence.

in a district the violence‐reducing effect of small CERP projects is roughly doubled.
Development expertise also complements the violence‐reducing effect of some
development programs. The presence of a PRT amplifies violence reduction of CERP
and CSP spending by between 50 and 200 percent, depending on the program.
Our findings should be useful in the design of development programs in
conflict and post‐conflict environments and may extend to fragile states in general,
where assistance may be captured, extorted, or destroyed.

I. Theory: Complementarity of Service Provision and Security in
Counterinsurgency

This section explores what an information‐centric model of counterinsurgency
implies about the complementarity between public service provision and security
provision in generating stability. That complementarity is intuitive: government
services should be of more value in a secure environment and security will be easier
to provide if the local population gives information to security forces, which is more
likely if the government provides basic services. To illustrate how the
complementarity emerges we build on the three‐sided game between government,
rebels, and a community, presented in BSF. We first state the assumptions and
equilibrium, referring to the original for motivation and proofs, and then develop
the results on complementarity.
A. Assumptions
1. Players and Actions
The government, G, seeks to reduce violence through counterinsurgency effort and
service provision. A rebel group, R, seeks to impose costs on government by
attacking it. A utility maximizing community, C, can help deliver control of territory
to government by anonymously sharing information about rebels.
2. Sequence of Play
Information sharing by the community requires no preparation so we assume that C
moves last. Play proceeds in four stages.
3

(1) Nature draws community norms favoring rebel control of their territory,
n, from a uniform distribution U[nL, nU]; n is private to C.
(2) G chooses a level of public goods to provide, g, and a level of
counterinsurgency effort, m. R simultaneously chooses a level of violence, v,
to attempt against G. (Assume nL and nU span enough of the real line to allow
nL≤ v + g ≤ nU .)
(3) C decides how much information, i, to share with G, having observed the
actions of G and R.
(4) Uncertainty regarding control of territory, a, is resolved, and payoffs
occur.

3. Technology of control
Control of territory is a binary state. The variable, a, is one if the government
controls the territory, and zero if the territory is controlled by rebels. The
probability of government control is
P(a=1) = h(m)i ,
where m is counterinsurgency effort by G, (m ≥ 0), h(m): R+ →[0,1] is a
monotonically increasing, concave contest success function, with h(0)=0 and h → 1
as m → ∞. Here i is the level of information that C chooses to share with G, (1≥i ≥ 0).
(All variables are real numbers unless otherwise specified.)
4. Payoffs
Community: Community utility is given by
UC(a,g,n,v ) = u(c + g – n ) a + u(c – v )(1‐a ) .
If a=1 (government control) then the community consumes c ≥0, and benefits from
government services, g ≥0, so it attains utility UC = u(c + g – n), where u(.) is
continuously differentiable and monotonically increasing. Services are local public
goods such as policing, dispute resolution, education, health clinics, utilities, and
infrastructure. Community norms, n, generate disutility when government is in
control.
4

Alternatively, if a=0, rebels may successfully carry out violence, v ≥ 0, against
government targets. In that case community members will attain utility UC = u(c – v).
Rebel violence, v, is not directed against community members per se, but we assume
that they suffer from it nonetheless, because they are accidentally affected by
crossfire, empathize with government employees, or value government targets. In
the case of rebel control the community does not benefit at all from government
services, g, either because the government withdraws services when it cannot
protect its employees and contractors, or because it conditions local public good
provision on control, as collective punishment. Conditionality would be unusual for a
social welfare maximizing government but is U.S. military policy in administering
CERP (U.S. Army, 2006). Survey evidence reveals that a majority of CERP
implementers in Afghanistan practice conditionality.5 This assumption is clearly
extreme; it cannot fully apply to all types of services, such as roads which cannot be
easily withdrawn. It could fully apply to services such as policing and justice, and
might well partially apply to services such as health and education. We discuss the
implications of relaxing conditionality below.
Incorporating the uncertainty that C faces about a , C’s expected payoff is
(1)

EUC(g,v,n,p)│n = u(c + g – n ) h(m) i + u(c – v )(1‐h(m) i ).

Rebels: Rebels use violence to impose costs on government, either in an attempt to
extract concessions, or in an effort to overthrow the government altogether (Tilly,
1978). In the Iraqi context these attacks would be mostly improvised explosive
device (IED) and direct fire attacks against Iraqi government or Coalition forces. Let
G’s cost of rebel violence be
A(v )(1‐a), which accounts for the damage caused by an attack. R’s benefit from
violence is then UR = A(v ) )(1‐a), where we assume that A(0) = 0 and that A is an
increasing, concave function. Rebels’ cost of violence is B(v), which is increasing and
convex. (Henceforth, all functions are assumed to be twice continuously
differentiable.) So R’s expected payoff is

EUR(v,a) = E[A(v )(1‐a) – B(v)] = A(v )(1‐p) – B(v) ,
where p ≡ h(m) E(i) .

Note that p = P(a=1) for rebels, for whom i is a random variable.
Government: The government bears the costs of violence as well as the costs of
violence mitigation (counterinsurgency), m, and of service provision, g, and gets
expected utility
(3)

ECG(v,m,g,a ) = E[A(v )(1‐a) + D(m) + H(g)] = A(v )(1‐p) + D(m) + H(g) .

We assume that D(0) = H(0) = 0, that cost functions D(.) and H(.) are monotonically
increasing, and that A(nU)>D'(0) , so that the fixed costs of m are never so high that
communities maximally predisposed to not share information are never cost
effective for G to engage.
B. Equilibrium
We focus on subgame perfect Nash equilibrium in pure strategies, solving by
backwards induction, starting with the community (step #3).
Community: The community chooses i on the closed interval [0,1] to maximize,
max

EUC(i,g,n,v,m)│n = u(c + g – n )p(m,i) + u(c – v )(1‐p(m,i)) .

Anticipating results on complementarity, note that since the probability of control is
proportional to information shared, public good provision and information are
complements, as are counterinsurgency effort and information. Since C chooses i
= h(m), so
0≥

u(c + g – n)h(m) ‐ u(c – v )h(m) ,

which implies that either m = 0 or that the best response function of the community
is

.

Consumption is neutral; it occurs whether information is shared or not. Norms
favoring rebel control reduce incentives to provide i.
6

Recalling our discussion of conditionality, we can now see why it matters.
Higher g induces C to share information in (4). In the absence of conditionality g
would be enjoyed under both government and rebel control, and would provide no
incentive for information sharing (i.e.,

∗

1 ↔

). So in the absence of

conditionality, g will have no effect on information‐sharing, and therefore no role in
the model. In the context of the model’s assumptions, then, any estimated effects we
find of g are evidence of conditionality.
Define p* ≡ p(i*,m), the probability of government control anticipating
optimal information sharing by the community. If m > 0 then E(i*) = P(i*=1) = P (n <
g+v ) = F(g+v ) = (g + v ‐ nL )f, where f =

E CG( v , m , g , p* ) = A(v )[1‐p*] + D(m ) + H(g ).

G’s first order condition for m is 0 ≤

‐A(v) (g+v‐nL)f h'(m) + D'(m) . Under the

mild assumption that A(nU) > D'(0) m=0 cannot be a Nash equilibrium, which
simplifies the analysis as it implies that p*>0 in (5). See BSF for proof.
‐A(v) (g+v‐nL)f h''(m) + D''(m) > 0, so

Turning to a solution for m*,

m has a unique interior solution for some m* >0, given v and g , defining a best
response function m*(v,g).
The government also chooses a level of services, g*, that solves the first order
condition 0 ≤

‐A(v)f h(m) + H'(g).

H''(g) > 0, which ensures a

unique interior solution at some g*>0, defining a best response function g*(v,m).
Solving cross partials and invoking the implicit function theorem BSF show
that best response functions are upward sloping in violence:

Existence: Assembling results, we have a closed form solution for optimal
information sharing by C in stage #3, and three equations in three unknowns that
determine best response functions m*(v,g) and g*(v,m) for G, and v*(g,m) for R in

In the general case we cannot solve for closed form solutions for m*, g* and v*, but

Figure 1 illustrates that equilibrium as point A in violence – enforcement space, and
in violence services space, as the intersection of downward sloping v* curves and an
upward sloping g* curve, (all conditional on the choice variable in the omitted
dimension).
C. Complementarity of service provision and enforcement
How should government apply scarce resources to services and counterinsurgency
effort? The answer depends on the complementarity of those inputs, which requires
a little explanation in a strategic context. Examining Figure 2a, we ask how the slope
of the optimal response function v* will change when g is increased, if it becomes
steeper (i.e., more negative) then we will say that services complement
counterinsurgency effort in inducing rebels to reduce violence.
∗
│
Proposition 1:
0 .
Proof: See Appendix.
Note that this complementarity goes beyond a technological property such as the
complementarity of inputs in a production function. It reflects instead the effect of g
in enhancing the violence reducing effect of m on the optimal choice of violence by
R. The intuition behind this complementarity is technological, though. It follows
from the fact that g complements m in the probability of information sharing in (4).
The proof shows that other countervailing forces are dominated by that
technological complementarity.
The same intuition underlies the symmetric effect of m on the violence
reducing effects of g, as illustrated in Figure 2b, and stated in Proposition 2:
∗

│

<0.

Proof: See Appendix.
Note that the twin complementarity propositions describe partial
equilibrium effects, which omit any additional shift in the m* curve, say, as a result
of a change in g, . This does not complicate the analysis since m and g are strategic
9

complements (in the government’s cost minimization). Thus, the general
equilibrium effect of an exogenous increase in g is a further reduction in violence, v,
due to the induced increase in m, and the same is true of an exogenous increase in
m.
Returning to the question of optimal allocation of resources for government,
the problem is analogous to that of a production possibility curve, in which the
violent strategic response of rebels is considered negative product. If we recast the
government’s problem as maximizing stability (negative violence) at minimal cost,
Figure 3 reflects their optimum at point A. Complementarity implies that the
production possibility curve is concave to the origin: neither enforcement nor service
provision would ever optimally be provided alone, but always together.7
This result is quite general. A less restrictive social welfare function might
include direct utility from service provision and utility (or disutility) from
enforcement, which would generalize our linear indifference curve in Figure 3 by
adding some curvature. Graphically, as long as that curve is not too concave to the
origin (diminishing returns would imply convexity) the basic result holds:
enforcement and service provision should always optimally appear in combination.
In section III below, we jointly test those two propositions using data on
troop strength and development spending during the Iraq war.

II. Data and Institutions
Development assistance was provided by an unusually wide range of U.S.
government actors in Iraq, most of whose activities are captured in our data. We
measure aid spending using data from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Gulf Region
Division’s Iraq Reconstruction Management System (IRMS). These unclassified data
include the start date, end date, project description, funding source, and amount
spent for 62,966 aid projects projects awarded through December 2008. They
include approximately $23 billion in aid projects funded under a variety of

Given the principle of complementarity, the optimal ratio of enforcement and
service provision will reflect local conditions, varying across time and space.

programs, including large‐scale reconstruction spending through DOD administered
programs such as the CERP, the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund (IRRF), and
various State Department programs including USAID activities funded through the
Economic Support Fund (ESF).8
The U.S. military allocated roughly $3B in aid through its CERP program.
CERP funds were allocated in small amounts, mostly by units at the brigade level
(approx. 3,000 soldiers) and below, without layers of subcontracting that made the
relationship between dollars spent and work done tenuous for other reconstruction
spending programs in Iraq. CERP spending was designed to work like g in our
model, by providing military commanders with resources to engage in small‐scale
projects to meet the needs of local communities, with the aim of garnering the
population’s support and cooperation. In practice, CERP funds were used to fund a
broad range of projects, from salary payments to major infrastructure projects,
though the majority went to small‐scale local public goods. In contrast, non‐CERP
projects were often quite large, with a typical project being infrastructure for water
and sanitation, or transportation.9
Besides DOD, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) also
provided small‐scale aid funds in Iraq, through two main programs, the $560M
Community Action Program (CAP) and the $644M Community Stabilization
Program (CSP). CAP ran from May 2003 through March 2010 and facilitated the
creation and training of local community groups which then identified small
infrastructure projects such as creating potable water storage tanks, wastewater
and irrigation systems, and small construction projects, averaging approximately
$101k in spending over 91 days. The theory behind the program was that
communities with weak civic institutions were more vulnerable to insurgent
influence and less able to demand the services they needed from the government.
CSP ran from May 2006 through August 2009 and focused on funding job creation
through training and small infrastructure projects in key cities, with the average
project costing $77k, and lasting 238 days. Importantly, CSP contractors tried to

brand their projects as being conducted by the local government, not by USAID or
the foreign NGO that implemented the program. While not explicitly tied to the
military campaign, as was CERP, CAP and CSP represented the civilian‐administered
programs most like CERP in terms of project size and duration.
Our key dependent variable is the intensity of insurgent activity measured as
the rate of attacks per capita against Coalition and Iraqi government forces. The
attack data is based on ‘significant activity’ (SIGACT) reports by Coalition forces that
capture a wide variety of information about “…executed enemy attacks targeted
against coalition, Iraqi Security Forces (ISF), civilians, Iraqi infrastructure and
government organizations.”10 These data provide the location and date of attack
incidents between February 2004 and February 2009.
We have data on force levels from the Lee (2011) Order of Battle Dataset,
which identifies the number of maneuver battalions (a.k.a. forces that are
responsible for defined physical territory) present in a district for each month from
February 2004 through December 2008. Lee’s data were compiled using press
reports and are described in detail in Lee (2012). Force allocation decisions in Iraq
were driven by a combination of strategic imperatives and practical constraints. At
the strategic level commanders moved battalions for a number of reasons, including
removing them from areas deemed to be pacified. For instance, after the large 3rd
Armored Cavalry Regiment (approx. 4,700 soldiers) reduced the violence in Tal Afar
from spring‐2005 through spring‐2006 it was replaced by a cavalry squadron
(approx. 800 soldiers). Alternatively, battalions were moved to areas deemed to be
more strategically vital, as when the additional forces sent to Iraq as part of the
2007 Surge were deployed in Baghdad and neighboring districts. To understand the
possible endogeneity of force levels in a particular district x half year, it’s important
to note organizational constraints. While there was surely an intention to allocate
battalions dynamically to the area of greatest need, the combination of troop
rotation schedules, and an organizational interest in maintaining unit cohesion and
GAO (2007), DOD (2008). The information provided in the Unclassified SIGACT
data are limited to the fact of and type of terrorist/ insurgent attacks (including
IED's) and the estimated date and location they occurred. See BSF for full details.

developing local knowledge among deployed battalions would tightly constrain a
commanders’ ability to reallocate troops in groups of less than about 800. Thus, in
the context of our model the marginal cost of additional m to a district was quite
high.
Provincial Reconstruction Team locations are coded using information
gathered from a set of maps provided by the State Department PRT office. US PRTs
were first established in late 2005, and that number rose to twenty by the second
half of 2008, each in a separate district. We do not count PRTs of other Coalition
forces, assuming that they would be less relevant for US development program
spending.
Appendix Table 1 provides descriptive statistics.

III. Results
Our empirical strategy is a straightforward first‐differences design in which we
regress changes on conflict on changes in various kinds of aid spending, controlling
for lagged changes in violence and changes in Coalition force levels.
Our basic estimating equation is:

included to account for short term, district‐specific trends. Since broad trends in
violence differed for Sunni areas, we also include a separate year fixed effect

Our empirical strategy will identify the causal impact of changes in aid
spending if either the omitted variables linking aid spending to insurgent violence
are entirely a function of unit‐specific trends or if their influence on aid spending is
accounted for by past changes in violence and changes in troop levels. The major

challenge is the possibility of a positive endogeneity bias if, conditional on trends
and other controls, increases in residual violence are anticipated and responded to
by application of more g or m, in a half‐year interval. That would cause our
estimates to understate the violence‐reducing effects of both g and m. The logistic
constraints and lags built into the allocation and implementation of both
development spending and effective patrols to a district make that type of rapid
response (within a half‐year) difficult but not impossible. For that reason we tried
specifications with various controls to investigate robustness.
Table 1 describes our first set of results, showing that small scale
reconstruction spending is violence reducing on average ( <0) but other types of
reconstruction spending are often not. Column (1) replicates the main empirical
result of BSF, that CERP is violence‐reducing. Column (2) demonstrates that the
CERP coefficient is robust to including troop strength (m) on the right hand side,
which BSF did not, indicating that violence‐reduction is not due to CERP spending
acting as a proxy for the presence of coercive force, m. Note that the coefficient on
troop strength does not indicate violence reduction –if anything the positive
coefficient on contemporaneous troop strength indicates that troops increase
violence, which is inconsistent with the predictions of our theory. We don’t think
that this finding overturns the validity of the theory for two reasons: First, the
incident data are reported by the troops themselves, so that there is a built in
upward bias in locations which have troops present. Second, there appears to be a
short term increase in violence on arrival which fades after about half a year, which
we suspect is due to a short term learning process in which new troops are initially
challenged by insurgents, who then withdraw as the troops develop situational
awareness in their area of operations. The sum of the coefficient on
contemporaneous troop strength and that on the lag is almost always statistically
zero, and will be negative in some of the specifications reported below. Thus, once
the upward reporting bias is accounted for, and allowing for a positive endogeneity
bias –as described above, the cumulative effect of troop strength appears to be
violence reduction (by an unknown amount) after about six months. (Including a

14

third –one year—lag of troop strength does not substantively alter any of those
conclusions.)
Returning to our discussion of development spending, columns (3) and (4)
replicate another main result of BSF, that small CERP is six times as violence‐
reducing per dollar spent than is large CERP, and demonstrate that those results are
also robust to the inclusion of troop strength. The remaining columns report the
effect of other programs, showing that only one of them, the Community
Stabilization Program (CSP), shows evidence of being violence‐reducing. Neither
changes in large non‐CERP reconstruction project, changes in small non‐CERP
reconstruction projects, changes in USAID spending through the CAP program, nor
changes in overall USAID spending are significantly correlated with changes in
insurgent attacks. While none of those programs (non‐CERP large or small, CAP or
USAID spending in general) show effects that are statistically different from zero,
with the exception of CSP, they are all statistically less violence‐reducing than is
small CERP (at α=.05), including large‐CERP (as reported in the final row of Table
1).
Why are CERP and CSP violence‐reducing while other programs are not, and
why is small CERP especially so? Firstly, it’s worth noting that this contrast reflects
the larger literature, in which economic activity, and even aid programs, are
sometimes associated with increased violence (i.e., predation, as Berman et al 2012
find in the Philippines, for example) and sometimes with decreased violence, as the
theory in section II predicts. Recalling the driving forces of that theory: programs
must be conducted in territory secure enough to be implementable, their design
must be sufficiently informed about local preferences to benefit the local
community; and they must be conditional on cooperation (i.e., information sharing).
Those criteria are consistent with the pattern of results in Table 1. CERP programs
are unusual in that they are secure by design, as they are administered by military
units operating in the area. Smaller programs such as CSP, CAP and CERP tend to be
better informed, because they are more likely designed in consultation with the
local community. And smaller programs are more easily conditioned on the
cooperation of communities, in contrast to large infrastructure projects (such as
15

building a water or sewerage system) which cannot easily be revoked. Moreover,
survey evidence from Afghanistan reveals that CERP was generally implemented
conditionally (see BSF, footnote 11), in contrast to how a development agency such
as USAID would typically implement programs, in accordance with a development
objective rather than a security objective.
Having discussed how those criteria can rationalize the results in Table 1, we
turn now to testing the implications of that theory. We examine whether security
and development expertise complement programs for which we have evidence of
effectiveness from Table 1, namely CERP and CSP.
Table 2 tests the hypothesis that security and development are complements,
at the district level. Recall that these are actually two conceptually distinct
hypotheses (Propositions 1 and 2), since in the context of model complementarity
need not be symmetric. Notwithstanding that subtlety, we can test these hypotheses
only jointly, by estimating the coefficient γ on the interaction of m and g in the
following estimating equation.

Should both propositions hold then γ1 will be negative.
Before turning to results, an issue of measurement requires attention. The
model provides no guidance as to how m should be measured (and doctrine is also
unclear). What we seek is the capacity of the government to apply coercive force in
order to suppress rebel activity. Until now we’ve measured troop strength in
battalions per district, which would be an adequate approximation if troops per
physical area were appropriate, following the logic of the response time to a tip or
incident being critical. Alternatively, troops per capita would be a good
approximation of the ability of the government to police and protect individuals. In
Table 2 we report results using both approaches.12

The results in Tables 1 and 3 are qualitatively robust to replacing battalions per
district with battalions per capita, as reported in Appendix Tables 2 and 3.

12

16

The left panel of Table 2 reports both main and interaction effects of
spending on small CERP, large CERP and CSP (columns (1), (2) and (3)). As
predicted by the complementarity propositions, the estimated interaction term is
negative in each case. All three coefficients are precisely enough estimated to reject
the hypothesis of a zero coefficient in favor of the alternative of complementarity.
The right panel checks robustness to measuring troop strength in battalions per
capita (as opposed to per district), again for each of the three programs. The
evidence for complementarity in this case is weaker, but consistent with the
previous results: two of the three coefficients are negative, and the one which is
statistically significant (the CSP x troop strength interaction in column (6)) is
negative as predicted. The ideal measure of m would somehow average troop
density over physical area and population, so a rough averaging of the three
precisely estimated negative coefficients in the left panel with the three estimates
on the right (two negative and one imprecisely estimated positive) indicates to us
fairly robust evidence of complementarity. Recalling our discussion of the possible
endogeneity of both g and m, since any endogeneity bias (despite our best efforts)
would be positive, these estimates, if anything, understate complementarity. This
evidence of complementarity between development spending and troop strength is
illustrated in Figure 4, which plots the predicted marginal effects estimated for
small and large CERP (in a combined regression) according to the number of
battalions present. Spending becomes more violence‐reducing as the number of
battalions per district increases. The density of battalions is also plotted in a rug
plot, to illustrate the predicted effect for a typical district.
A final testable implication of the model concerns the role of development
expertise. Here our interest is in distinguishing the mechanism in the model –which
relies on delivering a service, g, of value to the community, from a class of
“opportunity cost” models that inject wages and employment into the community
regardless of whether a service of value is generated.13 In other words, for a

omnibus model.
13

17

program to be successful at reducing violence, it must be a development success as
well, by delivering desired services to community members.14
We test the hypothesis that expertise matters by examining the interaction of
spending in the three programs with the presence of a Provincial Reconstruction
Team (PRT) in the district. Our working assumptions is that when programs are
informed by development experts they are more likely to involve consultation with
the community on their requested projects, and will be better designed and
implemented to effectively meet the community’s request. Formally, our hypothesis
is that the coefficient γ2 on the interaction term of g and PRT is negative, where PRT
is a binary indicator.

Table 3 reports results. Columns (1) reports the main effect of PRT presence
in isolation, which is violence reducing (i.e., negative) but not precisely enough
estimated to constitute evidence of effectiveness. Twenty nine percent of the
population lived in districts with a US PRT present during the sample period. As in
our discussion of m and g, endogeneity bias of the PRT coefficient would be away
from finding a violence‐reducing effect (i.e., positive), if we thought that PRTs were
instituted in anticipation of increased

,

. (No PRTs are withdrawn during our

sample period so inference is entirely based on the first half‐year of PRT presence.)
Establishing a PRT would often involve assembling a team, assigning them a security
detail, and sometimes even creating a separate base –if there was none already
available, which would make response within a half year unlikely but not
impossible. The reported coefficient is robust to removing the troop strength
variable, and the lagged violence measure (not shown). Column (2) reports that the
estimated violence‐reducing main effect of CERP (in Table 1) is robust to adding a
PRT indicator.

In a more general model with individual community members rather than a
representative agent, a program would only have to successfully deliver desired
services to individuals most likely to share information with government.
14

18

Columns (3), (4), (5) and (6) report our interaction tests. In all cases (CERP,
small CERP, large CERP and CSP) the interaction of PRT with development spending
yields a negative coefficient, indicating that the violence‐reducing effects of these
programs are enhanced by PRT presence. Those interactions effects are statistically
significant at the 10% for large CERP, and at the 1% level for small CERP. Small
CERP projects are almost three times as violence‐reducing (‐.067+‐0.36 vs. ‐.036)
when a PRT is present in the district. That pattern of complementarity is illustrated
in Figure 5, which shows the increase in violence reduction (the slope) when a PRT
is present.
Taking the evidence in Tables 1 ‐ 3 together, we can draw some conclusions.
Development spending is most violence‐reducing when it is secure, which addresses
the puzzle posed by Table 1 by the relative effectiveness of small CERP programs.
Development spending is also more violence reducing when it is informed by local
development experts. Small projects are more likely to be violence‐reducing, which
may reflect the fact that they are better informed, or may be due to their lending
themselves more readily to conditional implementation.15 Conversely, troop
strength is more violence‐reducing (or at least less violence‐increasing, as
measured) when small‐scale development spending is present. Finally, the data
suggest that smaller projects show stronger complementarities with expertise and
with security, which may reflect a further complementarity between conditionality
and both security on the one hand and expertise on the other.

IV. Conclusion

Overall the evidence from Iraq suggests that, in accordance with the information‐
centric (or “Hearts and Minds”) framework laid out, aid spending which is small,
conditional, secure, and effective as a development program creates incentives for

In results not reported we find no statistically significant complementarities
between either troop strength or PRTs on the one hand, and any of the other
programs measured in Table 1 on the other. We cautiously interpret that as
evidence that the conditionality and security that small projects allow is a
necessary condition for violence‐reduction in development spending.
15

19

cooperation with government that large, less secure and less informed projects do
not.
More generally, our theoretical perspective suggests a number of practical
lessons for aid programs. Complementarity, as illustrated by Figure 3, indicates that
a government wishing to suppress violence at minimal cost would mix the use of
development efforts and coercive force, rather than exclusively use one or the other.
Evidence suggests that most rebel groups recognize that logic and likewise mix
governance initiatives with coercion.16
These insights are drawn from the U.S. and Coalition experience in Iraq as an
occupying force, and then later in support of a domestic government combating a
very violent insurgency. Yet based on our experience applying the same model to
other fragile environments, we hypothesize that these lessons may well apply more
generally to domestic governments or to international assistance to local allies.
Sufficient conditions for development assistance to be stability enhancing in places
where a rebel of criminal element can capture or destroy projects are apparently
these: they should be modest, secure, conditional, and informed by local
preferences. Moreover engaging development expertise, rather than simply
spending funds, augments the stabilization effect. For instance, keeping
development experts hunkered down far from projects sites is unlikely to be
violence‐reducing. A logical corollary of complementarity between development and
security provision is that foreign assistance to governments fighting insurgencies
will be more effective when it includes capacity building in both g and m. Investing
in training security forces is a standard component of “small footprint” intervention,
yet governance assistance is typically limited to training for those who will manage
government agencies. Our analysis suggests that training those who would
implement local service provision may have a greater immediate violence‐reduction
effect. In the same vein, security forces, once trained, will be more effective if
redeployed out of large, insulated bases and instead engaging the local population in
a way that complements development efforts.

16

See BSF for discussion.

20

Finally, it is worth putting these results in context. Modest, secure, informed
and conditional should be thought of as sufficient conditions for violence‐reduction.
Further research is required to establish where and to what extent they are all
necessary. Further research may also reveal the extent to which a mix of capacity
building in both coercive and benign governance can generate medium and long run
stabilization –beyond a half‐year or one year horizon. The iso‐stability lines of
Figure 3 are drawn for a given set of norms and expectations. As expectations of
quality of governance improve, including political development and representation,
enhanced legitimacy should improve norms of cooperation with government ‐‐
rather than with rebels or criminals. That would shift iso‐stability lines to lower
levels of violence at the same cost to government in the medium and long term, and
allow governments (and allies) the option of shifting spending away from coercive
force and toward traditional development programs.

Appendix: Proofs of Propositions 1 and 2
The proofs of both propositions rely on partial differentiation of the slopes of the optimal
response functions of R in choosing v*.

│ /

=-

and by the implicit function theorem,

= - [-A'(v)( g + v - nL )f h'(m) -A(v)f h'(m)] / {A''(v)[1-p*] – 2A'(v)f h(m) - B''(v) }.
Denoting the numerator Δ and the denominator Ω,

<0,

since Δ' = A'(v)f h'(m) >0 , Ω <0, Δ > 0, and Ω' = -A''(v)f h(m) >0 , and Ω2 >0.

Proposition 2: :

Proof:

│

│ =-

<0.

│ /

by the implicit function theorem,

= - (-)A'(v)f h(m) / {A''(v)[1-p*] – 2A'(v)f h(m) - B''(v) }.
Denoting the numerator Δ and the denominator Ω,

- A'(v)f h(m){-A''(v) (g + v - nL )f h'(m) – 2A'(v)f h'(m)}
= A'(v)f h'(m) A''(v)[1-p*] – 2 A'(v)f h'(m) A'(v)f h(m) - A'(v)f h'(m) B''(v)
+A'(v)f h(m)A''(v) (g + v - nL )f h'(m) +2A'(v)f h(m) A'(v)f h'(m) .
The second and fifth terms cancel. The other three terms are negative (since A''(v) < 0 ),
so the expression is negative. Ω2 >0 , which implies that

Notes: An observation is a district (N=103) x half year. District Karkh is excluded as national CSP programs are confounded
with local there. Means are in changes, weighted by population. Regressions include NT=824 observations. Incidents are
measured per 1000 population, spending variables are per capita. Troop strength is measured in battalions per district.
