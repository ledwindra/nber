    "abstract": "\n\nWe study climate and macroprudential policies in an economy with financial frictions. Using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model featuring both a pollution market failure and a market failure in the financial sector, we explore transition risk \u2013 whether ambitious climate policy can lead to macroeconomic instability. It can, but the risk can be alleviated through macroprudential policies \u2013 taxes or subsidies on banks\u2019 assets. Then, we explore efficient climate and macroprudential policy in the long run and over business cycles. The presence of financial frictions affects the steady-state value and dynamic properties of the efficient carbon tax. Macroprudential policy alone, without a carbon tax, is not very effective at addressing the pollution externality.\n\n",
