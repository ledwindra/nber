    "abstract": "\n\nWe conduct a randomized evaluation of two job-search support programs for urban youth in Ethiopia. One group of treated respondents receives a subsidy to cover the transport costs of job search. Another group participates in a job application workshop where their skills are certified and they are given orientation on how to make effective job applications. The two interventions are designed to lower spatial and informational barriers to employment. We find that both treatments significantly improve the quality of jobs that young jobseekers obtain. Impacts are concentrated among women and the least educated. Using rich high-frequency data from a phone survey, we are able to explore the mechanisms underlying the results; we show that while the transport subsidy increases both the intensity and the efficacy of job search, the job application workshop mainly operates through an increase in search efficacy. Both interventions mitigate the adverse effects of spatial constraints on employment outcomes, and the job application workshop alleviates informational asymmetries by  helping workers to signal their ability.\n\n",

Data collection and experimental implementation were funded by GLM | LIC (\u2018Assisting Job Search in Low-Employment Communities: The Effect of Information Provision and Transport Vouchers in Addis Ababa\u2019) and by the International Growth Centre (\u2018Assisting Job Search in Low-Employment Communities: The Effect of a Screening Intervention in Addis Ababa\u2019). The project would not have been possible without the constant support of Rose Page and the Centre for the Study of African Economies (University of Oxford), nor without the support of the Ethiopian Development Research Institute in Addis Ababa. This RCT was registered in the American Economic Association Registry for randomized control trials under Trial number AEARCTR-0000911.

The job fair RCT was conducted in conjunction with the RCT discussed here, and used the same baseline and endline worker questionnaires. But the two studies rely on separate, non-overlapping samples.\n\n\n"
