    "abstract": "\n\nThe role of a real interest rate and a credit aggregate as intermediate monetary policy targets are investigated under the assumption of rational expectations. The analysis expands a standard aggregate model to include a credit market and a market determined interest rate on bank deposits. This allows the implications for output stabilization of real interest rate policy to be examined for a wider variety of shocks than normally considered in the literature, as well as allowing a credit aggregate policy to be studied.\n\n",
