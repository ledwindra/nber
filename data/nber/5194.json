    "abstract": "\n\nWe estimate the fraction of the wealth of a sample of PSID respondents that is held because some households face greater income uncertainty than others.  We first derive an equation characterizing the theoretical relationship between wealth and uncertainty in a buffer-stock model of saving.  Next, we estimate that equation using PSID data; we find strong evidence that households engage in precautionary saving.  Finally, we simulate the wealth distribution that would prevail if all households had the same uncertainty as the lowest-uncertainty group.  We find that between 39 and 46 percent of wealth in our sample is attributable to uncertainty differentials across groups.\n\n",
