    "abstract": "\n\nDrug use and welfare are two serious social problems that have received widespread public attention.  Recently, it has been suggested that illicit drug use is a major cause of welfare, although there is only anecdotal evidence to support such a claim.  This paper provides the first systematic analysis of the issue by examining the relationship between illicit drug use and welfare participation among a nationally representative sample of young adults.   The results indicate that past year drug use, predominantly marijuana use, is positively related to future welfare participation for both non-black and black women.  The magnitude of the drug effect, however, is modest: if drug use among welfare participants was reduced to the levels of non-participants, welfare participation would decline by approximately one percent.\n\n",
