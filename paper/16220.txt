Comparing Micro-evidence on Rent Sharing from Three Different Approaches

NBER Working Paper No. 16220
July 2010, Revised July 2015
JEL No. C23,D21,J31,J51
ABSTRACT
Empirical labor economists have resorted to estimating the responsiveness of workers wages on firms
ability to pay to assess the extent to which employers share rents with their employees. This paper
compares this labor economics approach with two other approaches that rely on standard micro production
data only: the productivity approach for which estimates of the output elasticities of labor and materials
and data on the respective revenue shares are needed and the accounting approach which boils down
to directly computing the extent of rent sharing from firm accounting information. Using matched
employer-employee data on 60,294 employees working in 9,849 firms over the period 1984-2001
in France, we quantify industry differences in rent-sharing parameters derived from the three approaches.
We find a median absolute extent of rent sharing of about 0.30 using either the productivity or the
accounting approach. Only exploiting firm-level information brings this median rent-sharing parameter
down to 0.16 using the labor economics approach. Controlling for unobserved worker ability further
reduces the median absolute extent of rent sharing to 0.08. Our analysis makes clear that the three
different approaches face important trade-offs. Hence, empirical economists interested in establishing
that profits are shared should select the appropriate approach based on the particular research question
and on the data at hand.

Introduction

Contrary to the Walrasian (competitive) labor market model, collective bargaining models predict a positive
relationship between wages of comparable workers and the pro…ts of their …rms.1 Starting from this theoretical
conjecture, a multitude of empirical studies have examined the e¤ect of industry or …rm performance on wages
using either industry or …rm data and have tested the rent-sharing hypothesis (e.g. Katz and Summers, 1989,
Blanch‡ower et al., 1996 and Estevao and Tevlin, 2003 for the US; Christo…des and Oswald, 1992 and Abowd
and Lemieux, 1993 for Canada; Teal, 1996 for Ghana; Van Reenen, 1996 for the UK; Goos and Konings,
2001 and Brock and Dobbelaere, 2006 for Belgium; Blanch‡ower et al., 1990, Holmlund and Zetterberg,
1991, Nickell et al., 1994 and Hildreth and Oswald, 1997 for a sample of European countries). These studies,
which are based on di¤erent identi…cation strategies, show without exception that changes in industry or
…rm pro…tability feed through into long-run changes in wages. In general, the estimated elasticities between
wages and pro…ts per employee range between 0.02 and 0.20, depending on the quality of the instruments
used to control for the endogeneity of pro…ts. Following the seminal contribution of Abowd et al. (1999),
providing a statistical decomposition of individual wages into worker and …rm e¤ects and focusing on the
private sector in France, and thanks to the availability of matched employer-employee datasets, more recent
studies account for non-random sorting of high-ability (and thus high-wage) workers into high-pro…t …rms
(e.g. Margolis and Salvanes, 2001 for France and Norway; Bronars and Famulari, 2001 for the US; Arai, 2003
and Nekby, 2003 for Sweden; Kramarz, 2003 for France; Rycx and Tojerow, 2004 and Du Caju et al., 2011
for Belgium; Guertzgen, 2009 for Germany; Martins, 2009 for Portugal). Using matched employer-employee
data to control for unobserved worker abilities, these studies typically obtain smaller e¤ects of …rms’ability
to pay on individual wages (in the [0.01-0.04]-range) compared to studies based on …rm-level data.
Although most empirical labor economists have provided evidence on rent sharing by testing the theoretical
conjecture that …rms’ pro…tability is an important determinant of workers’ wages, another set of studies
have relied on embedding the e¢ cient bargaining framework (McDonald and Solow, 1981) into standard
production function theory to recover rent-sharing parameters. Using only production data, they either
estimate a structural model with a full set of explicitly speci…ed factor share equations and the production
function (Bughin, 1996 for Belgium; Dumont et al., 2006 for a sample of European countries) or extend the
original Hall (1988) framework for estimating price-cost margins and estimate a reduced-form total factor
productivity equation (Crépon, Desplatz and Mairesse, 1999, 2005 for France; Dobbelaere, 2004 and Abraham
et al., 2009 for Belgium; Boulhol et al., 2011 for the UK). Depending on the estimation strategy, these studies
…nd estimated absolute extent of rent-sharing parameters ranging between 0.10 and 0.60.
The aforementioned evidence on rent sharing stems from one particular empirical approach chosen by the
researcher. Our contribution to the empirical collective bargaining literature is to paint a richer picture
of rent sharing by examining how the extent of rent sharing is conditioned by the chosen approach. More
speci…cally, this paper provides micro-evidence on rent sharing from orthogonal directions by exploiting
di¤erent dimensions in the same data, a matched employer-employee dataset, covering 103,995 employees
1 Similar

predictions are derived from a competitive labor market model with temporary frictions and positively sloped labor
supply schedules, an e¢ ciency wage model in which …rms use higher wages as an incentive to improve employees’ e¤ort or a
labor contract model in which workers and …rms are risk-sharing (see e.g. Blanch‡ower et al., 1996; Hildreth and Oswald, 1997).

working in 14,921 …rms belonging to 52 manufacturing industries over the period 1984-2001 in France. Our
analysis serves the purpose of quantifying industry di¤erences in rent-sharing parameters derived from three
approaches that di¤er in terms of data requirements and modeling assumptions.
The …rst approach, developed in Dobbelaere and Mairesse (2013), uses econometric production functions
as a tool for testing the competitiveness of labor and product markets and for assessing their degree of
imperfection.2 This approach, to which we refer as the productivity approach, only exploits the …rm-level panel
and requires data on production values, factor inputs and factor costs. It is based on the gap methodology
which essentially starts from the observation that any factors that create misallocation of resources can
be thought of as generating wedges in the …rst-order conditions of …rm optimization problems. As such,
di¤erences between the estimated industry-speci…c output elasticities of labor and materials and their revenue
shares are key to classifying industries in regimes characterizing the type of competition prevailing in product
and labor markets. Considering two product market settings (perfect competition (P C) and imperfect
competition (IC)) and three labor market settings (perfect competition or right-to-manage bargaining (P R),
Nickell and Andrews, 1983, e¢ cient bargaining (EB) and monopsony (M O), Manning, 2003), we distinguish
six regimes.
We de…ne both the labor market and the product market at the level of the 2-digit industry classi…cation.
The industry classi…cation for product markets is rather straightforward. The operational de…nition of the
labor market is motivated by the fact that France is characterized by industry-based unionism, justifying
an analysis at the industry level. An additional reason for the selection of France is that the government
often extends the terms of industry-level bargaining agreements to all employers, implying that collective
bargaining coverage is very high (around 95%), making a rent-sharing analysis particularly relevant.
Taken the productivity approach as our benchmark, we select the 25 out of the 52 industries that are
characterized by imperfect competition in the product market and e¢ cient bargaining in the labor market.
For these IC-EB-industries, we derive industry-speci…c estimates of extent of rent-sharing parameters and
compare those with rent-sharing parameters obtained from the two other approaches, referred to as the labor
economics approach and the accounting approach. From a conceptual point of view, these two approaches
share a common feature. They are compatible with worker-…rm negotiations that di¤er in terms of bargaining
scope. Bargaining issues might involve only wages, in which case the …rm retains the right to determine
employment unilaterally (right-to-manage bargaining), wages and employment (e¢ cient bargaining) or wages
and working practices (labor hoarding, Haskel and Martin, 1992). However, they di¤er in terms of data
requirements: similar to the productivity approach, the accounting approach only uses the …rm-level panel
whereas the labor economics approach exploits the worker-…rm panel. In the labor economics approach, we
estimate a wage equation taking into account unobserved worker and …rm heterogeneity. From the estimated
industry-speci…c wage-pro…t elasticities, we retrieve industry-speci…c rent-sharing parameters. Under the
assumption of constant returns-to-scale and a particular measurement of the workers’alternative wage, we
compute directly industry-speci…c measures of rent sharing from …rm accounting information on production
values, variable factor inputs and variable factor costs in the accounting approach.
2 This

approach has been implemented in three comparative studies: one using …rm-level data for Belgium and the Netherlands
(Dobbelaere and Vancauteren, 2014), one using …rm-level data for France, Japan and the Netherlands (Dobbelaere et al., 2015a)
and another using …rm-level data for Chile and France (Dobbelaere et al., 2015b).

3

Irrespective of the approach, we …nd sizeable di¤erences in the absolute extent of rent sharing across the 25
IC-EB-industries with the degree of dispersion lying in the [0.10-0.20]-range. Based on the …rm-level panel
dimension only, the median absolute extent of rent sharing amounts to 0.29 according to the productivity
approach and 0.32 according to the accounting approach. Only exploiting …rm-level information brings the
median absolute extent of rent sharing down to 0.16 using the labor economics approach. Controlling for unobserved worker ability –thereby considering the possibility that high-ability workers might be systematically
sorted into high-pro…t …rms–further reduces the median absolute extent of rent sharing to 0.08. Converting
the rent-sharing parameters obtained from the productivity and the accounting approach into wage-pro…t
elasticities shows that the median values of wage-pro…t elasticities lie in the [0.035-0.30]-range. The median
wage-pro…t elasticities derived from the productivity or the accounting approach are 6 to 8 times higher than
the ones derived from the labor economics approach. These di¤erences across the three approaches can be
attributable to di¤erences in the sources of identi…cation of the rent-sharing parameters and to di¤erences
in modeling assumptions about the underlying labor bargaining setting and the nature of competition in
the product market. Hence, our analysis clearly shows that the three approaches face important trade-o¤s.
Empirical economists interested in quantifying the impact of pro…tability conditions on wages should thus
carefully select the appropriate approach based on the particular research question and on the data at hand.
We proceed as follows. Section 2 discusses the productivity approach. Section 3 presents the labor economics
approach. Section 4 focuses on the accounting approach. Section 5 compares industry di¤erences in rentsharing parameters across the three approaches. Section 6 concludes.

2.1

Productivity approach
Theoretical framework

This section discusses, what we call, the productivity approach to recovering the extent of rent sharing.
In contrast to the most popular approach in empirical labor economics which relies on a wage equation
estimation, this approach requires standard production data while allowing for three distinct labor market
settings (perfect competition or right-to-manage bargaining, e¢ cient bargaining and monopsony). Essentially,
this approach nests the canonical rent-sharing models and the monopsony model in the seminal framework of
Hall (1988) for estimating price-cost margins and scale economies. These imperfectly competitive models of
wage determination are both intuitively appealing and tractable and can be viewed as representing two polar
extremes: rent-sharing models allocate market power to employees through costs of …ring, hiring and training
while the monopsony model allocates market power to employers through search frictions or heterogeneous
worker preferences for job characteristics which generate upward sloping labor supply curves to individual
…rms (Booth, 2014). We present the main ingredients of the theoretical framework. For technical details, we
refer to Dobbelaere and Mairesse (2013).
We start from a production function Qit = it F (Nit ; Mit ; Kit ), where i is a …rm index, t a time index, N is
labor, M is material input and K is capital. it = Ae i +ut + it , with i an unobserved …rm-speci…c e¤ect, ut
a year-speci…c intercept and it a random component, is an index of technical change or “true” total factor
productivity. Denoting the logarithm of Qit ; Nit ; Mit ; Kit and it by qit ; nit ; mit ; kit and it respectively,

where ("Q

Firms operate under imperfect competition in the product market (IC). We allow for three labor market settings (LM S): perfect competition or right-to-manage bargaining (P R)3 , e¢ cient bargaining (EB)
and monopsony (M O). We assume that material input and labor are variable factors. Short-run pro…t

In both settings, labor is unilaterally determined by the …rm from pro…t maximization, i.e. the wage rate equals the marginal
revenue of labor.

2.2

Estimation method

We use econometric production functions as a tool for testing which type of product/labor market setting
prevails and for assessing the degree of market power in product and labor markets. Since we de…ne both the
product market and the labor market at the level of the 2-digit industry classi…cation and our study aims
at comparing industry di¤erences in rent-sharing parameters across three di¤erent approaches, we estimate
average parameters. The empirical speci…cation that acts as the bedrock for the regressions at the industry
level is hence given by:
qit =

[

N

(nit

kit ) +

M

(mit

N

(kit

(12)

with it = ! it + it . Of the error components, ! it represents unobserved productivity to the econometrician
but possibly observed by the …rm at t when input decisions are made (transmitted productivity shock), while
it captures all other sources of error or productivity that is not observed by the …rm before making input
choices at t. Our method of retrieving product and labor market imperfection parameters from the gap
between the estimated average output elasticities of labor and materials and their average revenue shares
allows to wash out …rm-level di¤erences in adjustment costs which are temporary in nature, i.e. related to
the business cycle.
The most important methodological issues that emerge when estimating microeconomic production functions
are the simultaneity bias, omitted price bias, selection bias/endogeneity of attrition and measurement error.
We focus here on the …rst one.4 The recent literature on production function estimation is dominated by two
econometric approaches that di¤er in handling endogeneity of inputs and unobserved productivity in models
linear in parameters. Intuitively, both approaches di¤er in the way they put assumptions on the economic
environment that allow econometricians to exploit lagged input decisions as instruments for current input
choices. The parametric generalized method of moments (GMM ) approach relies on instrumental variables.
The semiparametric structural control function approach uses observed variables and economic theory to
invert out productivity nonparametrically and hence to obtain an observable expression for productivity.
Since (i) we are primarily interested in retrieving consistent production function coe¢ cients rather than an
accurate measure of productivity and (ii) we prefer to implement the same estimation method in the labor
economics approach (see Section 3.2), we judge the parametric GMM approach to be the most appropriate.
In particular, we rely on a general approach to estimating error components models designed for panels with
few time periods and many individuals, covariates that are not strictly exogenous, unobserved heterogeneity,
heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation within individuals, developed by Arellano and Bover (1995) and Blundell and Bond (1998) (SYS-GMM estimator). This approach extends the standard (…rst-di¤ erenced) GMM
estimator of Arellano and Bond (1991) by relying on a richer set of orthogonal conditions.5 The error components are an unobserved …xed e¤ect ( i ), a possibly autoregressive productivity shock (! it = ! it 1 + it
with j j < 1) and serially uncorrelated measurement errors ( it ), with it ; it
i:i:d. Consistent with our
4 We refer the reader to Van Beveren (2012) for a descriptive overview and to Dobbelaere et al. (2015a) for a discussion of
these issues.
5 The Arellano-Bover/Blundell-Bond estimator assumes that the …rst di¤erences of the instrumental variables are uncorrelated
with the …xed e¤ects, which allows the introduction of more instruments which might improve e¢ ciency dramatically.

6

static theoretical framework, we estimate the restricted version of the Blundell-Bond model and only consider
idiosyncratic productivity shocks (imposing = 0).
We apply the two-step GMM estimator which is asymptotically more e¢ cient than the one-step GMM
estimator and which is robust to whatever patterns of heteroskedasticity and cross-correlation. We use a
…nite-sample correction to the two-step covariance matrix developed by Windmeijer (2005). We build sets
of instruments following the Holtz-Eakin et al. (1988)-approach which avoids the standard two-stage least
squares trade-o¤ between instrument lag depth and sample depth by including separate instruments for each
time period and substituting zeros for missing observations. To avoid instrument proliferation, we only use 2and 3-year lags of the instrumented variables as instruments in the …rst-di¤erenced equation and the 1-year
lag of the …rst-di¤erenced instrumented variables as instruments in the original equation. The validity of
GMM crucially hinges on the assumption that the instruments are exogenous. We report both the Sargan and
Hansen test statistics for the joint validity of the overidentifying restrictions.6 In addition to the Hansen test
evaluating the entire set of overidentifying restrictions/instruments, we provide di¤erence-in-Hansen statistics
to test the validity of subsets of instruments.

2.3

Data requirements: Firm-level panel

The key insight from the productivity approach is that industry-speci…c parameters of product and labor
market imperfections can be uncovered from production data with only information on production values,
usage of inputs and inputs costs, therefore only exploiting the …rm-level panel. The …rm accounting data
are sourced from EAE (“Enquête Annuelle d’Entreprise”, “Service des Etudes et Statistiques Industrielles”
(SESSI)). Our estimation period covers the years 1984-2001. Since our instrumentation strategy entails using
up to 3-year lags of input factors as instruments and we have …rm accounting information prior to 1984, we
restrict our total sample to …rms having at least four consecutive observations during the period 1981-2001.
After some trimming on …rm input shares in total revenue, …rm input growth rates, …rm average wages and
…rm accounting pro…ts to eliminate outliers and anomalies in the total sample, our estimation sample consists
of an unbalanced panel of 14,921 …rms covering the period 1984-2001. Table B.1 in Appendix B gives the
panel structure of the total sample (period 1981-2001) and the estimation sample (period 1984-2001).
Output is de…ned as current production de‡ated by the two-digit producer price index.7 Labor (N ) refers to
the average number of employees in each …rm for each year. Material input (M ) is de…ned as intermediate
6 We

opt to report both the Sargan and the Hansen statistics after the two-step estimations since the Sargan tests do not
depend on an estimate of the optimal weighting matrix and are hence not so vulnerable to instrument proliferation. On the
other hand, they require homoskedastic errors for consistency which is not likely to be the case. As documented by Andersen
and Sørensen (1996) and Bowsher (2002), instrument proliferation might weaken the Hansen test of instrument validity to the
point where it generates implausibly good p-values (see Roodman, 2009 for a discussion).
7 As in many …rm-level datasets, we observe …rm-level revenues and not prices and quantities separately. The productivity
literature is dominated by two approaches to deal with this issue. One approach de‡ates …rm-level revenues by an industrylevel price index and thus estimates a revenue production function rather than an output production function. The other
approach follows Klette and Griliches (1996) which amounts to adding the growth in industry output as an additional regressor.
Theoretically, this approach relies on the assumption that the market power of …rms originates from product di¤erentiation.
Intuitively, in the case of product di¤erentiation, the demand for an individual …rm’s products is a function of its relative
price within the industry. Relative price di¤erences can then be expressed in terms of relative output growth di¤erences in the
industry. We follow the predominant approach in the literature and use the former.

consumption de‡ated by the two-digit intermediate consumption price index. The capital stock (K) is
measured by the gross bookvalue of …xed assets. The shares of labor ( N ) and material input ( M ) are
constructed by dividing respectively the …rm total labor cost and unde‡ated intermediate consumption by
the …rm unde‡ated production and by taking the average of these ratios over adjacent years.
Table 1 reports the mean, standard deviation and quartile values of our main variables needed for implementing the productivity approach. The average growth rate of real …rm output is 3:1% per year over the
period 1984-2001. Labor, materials and capital have increased at an average annual growth rate of 1:1%,
4:4% and 0:5% respectively. The median shares of labor and materials in total revenue amount to 0.29 and
0.52 respectively.
<Insert Table 1 about here>
As discussed above, we allow for heterogeneity of the production technology across …rms by breaking the
estimation sample into 52 manufacturing industries, which are based on the French industrial classi…cation
(“Nomenclature économique de synthèse - Niveau 3”[NES 114]). The fourth column of Table B.2 in Appendix
B presents the number of …rms and the number of observations for each industry in the estimation sample
(minimum: 547 observations).

2.4

Identi…cation of IC-EB-industries

For each industry I 2 f1; : : : ; 52g, we estimate the standard Cobb-Douglas production function [Eq. (12)]
using the SYS-GMM estimator.
Eq. (8) shows that the gap between the estimated output elasticities of labor and materials and their revenue
shares are key to empirical identi…cation of the product and labor market imperfection parameters. Intuitively,
in a perfectly competitive labor market or in a right-to-manage bargaining setting, the marginal employee
receives a wage that equals his/her marginal revenue. As such, the only source of discrepancy between the
estimated output elasticity of labor and the share of labor costs in revenue is the price-cost mark-up, just like
in the materials market, yielding the value zero of the joint market imperfections parameter. In an e¢ cient
bargaining setting, the marginal employee gets a wage that exceeds his/her marginal revenue since e¢ cient
bargaining allocates inframarginal gains across employees, yielding the positive value of the joint market
imperfections parameter. In a monopsony setting, on the other hand, the marginal employee obtains a wage
that is less than his/her marginal revenue, yielding the negative value of the joint market imperfections
parameter.
On pragmatic grounds, we consider that de…ning perfect competition in both product and labor markets as
respectively implying I = 1 and I = 0 is too excessive. We have chosen I0 = 1:10 and j I0 j = j0:10j
as reasonable threshold values. Our classi…cation procedure is entirely based on the point estimates of the
price-cost mark-up I and the joint market imperfections parameter I . For example, if our null hypothesis
is that imperfect competition in the product market and e¢ cient bargaining in the labor market feature the
industry, we perform the following test: H10 : ( I 1) > 0:10 and H20 : I > 0:10. The test rejects that
the IC-EB-regime applies if either H10 or H20 is rejected. This procedure is summarized in Appendix A.
8

Once the regime is determined, we are able to derive industry-speci…c estimates of price-cost mark-up ( I )
and rent-sharing ( I ) parameters if the e¢ cient bargaining model prevails or price-cost mark-up and labor
supply elasticity ( "N
w I ) parameters in case of the monopsony model (see Eq. (8) and (9), respectively).
Table B.3 in Appendix B presents the industry classi…cation. For details on the speci…c industries belonging
to each regime, we refer to column 8 of Table B.2 in Appendix B. Given that rent sharing is more likely
to take place in industries where rents can be extracted, we select industries characterized by imperfect
competition in the product market and e¢ cient bargaining in the labor market (IC-EB) to compare average
industry-speci…c rent-sharing parameters derived from the three approaches. The IC-EB-regime is by far the
most predominant regime: 25 out of the 52 industries (48%) belong to this regime. The IC-EB-industries
contain 66% of the …rms (9; 849 out of the 14; 921 …rms) and represent 58% of total employment. They
include the clothing, leather goods, publishing, furniture, shipbuilding, aircraft, metal products, medical and
surgical equipment, paper products, rubber products and electronics industries. The lower part of Table
1 reveals a lower average growth rate of real …rm output, labor and capital (of 2.6%, 0.9% and 0.3% per
year, respectively) in the IC-EB-sample compared to the estimation sample which includes all the prevalent
regimes.

2.5

Average rent-sharing parameters in IC-EB-industries

From Eq. (8), it follows that the productivity approach allows to identify average industry-speci…c relative
rent-sharing parameters by comparing the estimated average industry-speci…c production function coe¢ cients, i.e. the estimated average industry-speci…c output elasticities of labor and materials, with the average
industry-speci…c shares of labor and materials in revenue:

interval for a future observation. Put di¤erently, this statistic indicates the extent to which wages would
increase if a worker were to move from a …rm at the bottom of the pro…t distribution (two standard deviations
below the mean level of pro…ts) to a …rm at the top of the pro…t distribution (two standard deviations above
the mean) ceteris paribus.
In addition to the rent-sharing parameters reported in Table 2, Table B.5 in Appendix B also reports the
computed factor shares, output and scale elasticity estimates, joint market imperfections parameter and
price-cost mark-up, and the diagnostic tests. For reasons of completeness, Table B.5 also presents the
industry-speci…c SYS-GMM estimates of the industries which are classi…ed in the 5 other regimes (P C-P R,
IC-P R, P C-EB, P C-M O and IC-M O). In Table B.5, industries within the P C-P R- and IC-P R-regimes

(ind. I = 6; 8; 11; 44; 48), the Hansen test also rejects the joint validity of the identifying restrictions. For

industry I = 6; 11; 48, the di¤erence-in-Hansen tests reject the exogeneity of the 1-year lagged …rst-di¤erenced
inputs as instruments in the levels equation.
Table 2 shows that the absolute extent of rent-sharing parameter ( prod
) is estimated to be lower than 0.22
I
for the …rst quartile of industries and higher than 0.35 for the top quartile. The average and median values of
prod
are both estimated at 0.29. Since the two variants of both the wage-pro…t elasticity and Lester’s range
I
of wages due to rent sharing are very similar, we focus the discussion on the …rst variant. The wage-pro…t
elasticity is lower than 0.22 for industries in the …rst quartile and higher than 0.34 for industries in the third
prod

quartile. The average and median values of "w

N

amount to 0.28 and 0.25 respectively. This implies

I

that, on average, a doubling of pro…ts per employee increases average …rm wages by 28% ceteris paribus.
These large wage-pro…t elasticity estimates are close to the …rm-level results of Abowd and Lemieux (1993),
Teal (1996), Van Reenen (1996), Estevao and Tevlin (2003) and the matched worker-…rm results of Martins
(2009). These studies rely on, what we call, the labor economics approach to estimating rent sharing which
boils down to estimating a wage equation and control for endogeneity of (quasi-) rents by using exogenous
demand shifters as instruments.9 Lester’s range of wages due to rent sharing is lower than 0.73 for the …rst
prod
quartile of industries and higher than 1.31 for the top quartile. The average and median values of LI
amount to 1.18 and 0.98 respectively. Hence, on average, it appears that the wage of a worker would increase
by 118% if she switched from a low-pro…t to a high-pro…t …rm ceteris paribus.

Labor Economics approach
Theoretical framework

This section discusses the labor economics approach to recovering the extent of rent sharing. Using a standard
Nash-bargaining setup, we present three bargaining models –the canonical e¢ cient bargaining and right-tomanage models and the labor hoarding model–which are characterized by a di¤erent bargaining scope and
which predict that workers will receive wages in excess of their best alternative, with this di¤erence depending
positively on their …rms’pro…tability.
3.1.1

E¢ cient bargaining model

The e¢ cient bargaining (EB) model assumes that the workers and the …rm negotiate simultaneously over
wages and employment in order to maximize the joint surplus of their economic activity. The bounds of
the bargaining range are given by the minimum acceptable utility levels for both parties. In the absence
of an agreement, both parties receive their fallback utility. It is the objective of the workers to maximize
U (wit ; Nit ) = Nit wit + (N it Nit )wit , where N it is the competitive employment level (0 < Nit N it ) and
wit
wit the alternative wage. Consistent with capital quasi-…xity, it is the …rm’s objective to maximize
9 In particular, Abowd and Lemieux (1993) use prices of imports and exports, Teal (1996) exchange rate variation, Van
Reenen (1996) past technological innovations, Estevao and Tevlin (2003) demand shifters retrieved from input-output tables
and Martins (2009) interactions between the exchange rate and the share of exports.

its short-run pro…t function: it = Rit wit Nit jit Mit , where Rit = Pit Qit stands for total revenue and
Qit = it F (Nit ; Mit ; Kit ). The revenue-shifting parameter ( it ) is a function of the production technology
and the demand for the …nal good. In the absence of an agreement, the representative worker receives the
alternative wage. If no revenue accrues to the …rm when bargaining breaks down, the …rm’s short-run pro…t
equals zero in which case the …rm has to bear only the …xed costs of capital. Hence, the generalized Nash
product is written as:

Solving simultaneously Eqs. (19) and (20) leads to the following expression for the contract curve:

(21)

Eq. (21) shows that under risk neutrality, the …rm’s decision about employment equals the one of a (nonbargaining) neoclassical …rm that maximizes its short-run pro…t at the alternative wage. Put di¤erently, the
…rm hires workers until the marginal revenue of labor is equal to the wage a worker would receive if …red,
i.e. the employment level does not depend on the bargained wage.
3.1.2

Right-to-manage model

The right-to-manage (RT M ) model postulates that the workers negotiate with the …rm over wages while the
…rm chooses its pro…t-maximizing employment level. The generalized Nash product to be maximized now
becomes:
RT M

where Nit (wit ) represents the optimal employment level chosen by the …rm given the level of the bargained
wage. This optimal level of employment is obtained from the solution to the …rm’s pro…t maximization
problem:
(RN )it = wit
(23)
Eq. (23) shows that employment is endogenous with respect to bargained wages.
Maximization of Eq. (22) with respect to the wage rate subject to Eq. (23) is equivalent to Eq. (19).

3.1.3

Labor hoarding model

The labor hoarding (LH) model is based on two key assumptions. First, there exists overhead labor at
the …rm, denoted by (NO )it , which can either be interpreted as a proportion of the workers’ time that is
paid for but unproductive to the …rm due to e.g. illicit shirking, set-up of machinery or co¤ee breaks, or
the proportion of the workforce (rather than the hour) that is paid for but unproductive due to generous
crew sizes or overmanning. Second, workers value on-the-job leisure and their preferences are represented by

the following objective function: V (wit ; (NO )it ) = (wit

the …rm negotiate simultaneously over wages and overhead labor while productive labor is unilaterally chosen
by the …rm at the pro…t-maximizing level:

with (RNP )it the marginal revenue of productive labor. Assuming that both types of labor are paid the same,
the generalized Nash product is now written as:

Maximization of Eq. (25) with respect to the wage rate subject to Eq. (24) is equivalent to Eq. (19) with

Estimation method

Following standard practice in the collective bargaining literature, the statistical speci…cation of the equilibrium wage-pro…t relation that results from the bargaining process described above [Eq. (19)] is given
by:

(28)

where wj(i)t are net nominal earnings of individual j working in …rm i at date t. The alternative wage wit is
captured by the 5th percentile value of the worker wage distribution of the employing …rm i at time t. it ,
Nit and K
L it are respectively the accounting pro…ts, employment and capital intensity of …rm i at time t.

From the previous section, it is clear that Eq. (19) is independent of the true nature of the employment
function. Since Eq. (28) is simply the empirically testable wage equation of this equilibrium wage-pro…t
relation that we estimate for each industry I, the rent-sharing parameter estimates that are derived from
the estimated wage-pro…t elasticities are compatible with worker-…rm negotiations that di¤er in terms of
bargaining scope: either only wages (RT M model), wages and employment (EB model) or wages and
working practices (LH model). We follow most of the literature by estimating Eq. (19) in logs rather than in
levels (Martins, 2007). The motivation of estimating the wage equation in logs is essentially that bargaining
does not apply to negative pro…ts. By taking the natural logarithm of our pro…ts-per-worker variable, we
lose 7% of the observations in the sample.
The most important methodological issues that arise when identifying the impact of …rm pro…tability on
worker wages are the endogeneity of pro…ts per employee, omitted variable bias and measurement error. The
endogeneity of pro…ts is due to two sources of reverse causality. First, the wage-pro…t elasticity might be
underestimated due to the accounting relationship between wages and pro…ts, implying that higher wages
lead to lower pro…ts. Second, theories of incentive pay and e¢ ciency wages (Shapiro and Stiglitz, 1984;
Akerlof and Yellen, 1986) predict that higher wages might lead to higher pro…ts, which could generate an
upward bias in wage-pro…t elasticities. Omitted variables, correlated with the pro…t measure, might render
the rent-sharing coe¢ cients inconsistent. Wages might vary across …rms due to di¤erences in …rms’ skill
compositions, wage and employment policies, organization type, technological conditions or a set of unknown
factors. Not accounting for a systematic sorting of workers across …rms might also bias the estimated wagepro…t relation. A variety of …rm-speci…c measures of pro…ts or productivity have been used in the literature
including accounting pro…ts per employee, the rate of return on capital, quasi rents (pro…ts adjusted by
alternative opportunity costs for labor and capital) per employee, Tobin’s q and Solow residuals. Each of
these variables are likely to be measured with error, potentially causing biased and inconsistent rent-sharing
estimates, particularly with di¤erenced data.
Consistent with the productivity approach, we deal with the endogeneity problem by applying the twostep SYS-GMM estimator. A common instrumentation strategy in the literature is to use lagged values of
…rm pro…tability as instruments (see e.g. Blanch‡ower et al., 1996; Hildreth and Oswald, 1997). As data
limitations precluded us from using exogenous …rm demand shifters as a source of variation of pro…ts that
does not impact directly upon wages, we follow this common practice. In particular, we use the 2- and 3-year
lags of the smoothed pro…ts-per-employee variable as instruments in the …rst-di¤erenced equation and the
1-year lag of the …rst-di¤erences smoothed pro…ts-per-employee variable as instruments in the levels equation.
We evaluate both the entire set of instruments using the Sargan and Hansen test statistics and subsets of
instruments using di¤erence-in-Hansen statistics. Having repeated information on individuals, we control
for unobserved worker ability and …rm …xed e¤ects. We take into account di¤erences in …rms’ labor skill
composition by including the capital intensity for each …rm-year (Griliches, 1969; Bronars and Famulari, 2001
Du¤y et al., 2004). If capital and skilled labor are complements, capital-intensive …rms will hire workers with

14

greater observed and unobserved skills, implying that the wage-pro…t elasticity estimates might simply pick
up the impact of higher unobserved ability.10
We restricted the estimation of Eq. (28) to individuals working in the same …rms across di¤erent years,
i.e. we exclude worker mobility. Our motivation is twofold. First, we are primarily interested in obtaining
consistent estimates of the wage-pro…t elasticity "w , rather than separately identifying individual and
N

…rm-level unobserved heterogeneity
j(i) and i , respectively themselves. Therefore, s =
j(i) + i is
de…ned as the unobserved spell e¤ect for individual-…rm spell s (Abowd et al., 1999; Andrews et al., 2006).
Second, although we have data for several years and for several individuals in the …rm, we could have chosen
to control for individual unobserved heterogeneity as well as …rm-level unobserved heterogeneity in a single
…xed-e¤ects estimation. The problem is, however, that separate identi…cation of both types of unobserved
heterogeneity relies on workers who move between employers. This identi…cation strategy is only valid if
workers’employer switches are exogeneous and random, which is not likely to be the case (see Gibbons and
Katz, 1992) and impossible to verify without having information on the reason of mobility.

3.3

Data requirements: Matched worker-…rm panel

Following the most recent stream of the empirical collective bargaining literature, we use matched employeremployee information to recover industry-speci…c rent-sharing parameters using the labor economics approach. Our employer-employee data are drawn from the DADS (“Déclarations Annuelles des Données
Sociales”). The DADS is a large-scale administrative database collected by INSEE (“Institut National de la
Statistique et des Etudes Economiques”) and maintained in the Division des Revenus. The data are based on
a mandatory employer report of the gross earnings of each employee subject to French payroll taxes. These
taxes apply to essentially all employed individuals in the economy. The Division des Revenus provides an
extract of the DADS for scienti…c purposes, covering all individuals employed in French enterprises who were
born in October of even-numbered years, excluding civil servants.
Our estimation sample is obtained by merging the …rm current account and balance sheet data of the 14,921
…rms covering the years 1984-2001 that we used in the productivity approach with the matched employeremployee information. Because of the 1990 Census, however, we excluded the year 1990 from the DADS
database. For each observation, we have information on the exact starting date and end date of the job spell
in the …rm and the full-time/part-time status of the worker. Each …rm-worker-year observation additionally
includes information on the individual’s sex, month, year and place of birth, current occupation and total
net nominal earnings during the year. Employer characteristics include the location and industry of the
employing …rm. As motivated above, we only select individuals who remained at the same …rm across
di¤erent years (labelled as stayers) for regression purposes.11 In addition, we restrict the estimation to
full-time stayers who worked 12 months a year for at least 2 years. After some trimming on net nominal
earnings to eliminate outliers and anomalies, our matched worker-…rm estimation sample contains 648,889
observations, corresponding to 103,995 employees working in 14,921 …rms covering the period 1984-2001. The
1 0 From a theoretical perspective, the inclusion of capital-intensity might be motivated by the fact that
it in the Nash product
[Eqs. (18), (22) or (25)] represents the average absolute extent of rent sharing across skill groups.
1 1 Looking at the original sample of individuals who worked full-time, 12 months a year for at least 2 years, we observe that
91% of the individuals are non-movers, 5% of the individuals change employers once and 4% move twice between employers.

15

sixth column of Table B.2 in Appendix B presents the number of workers and the number of observations for
each of the 52 industries (minimum: 1,468 observations). Table B.4 in Appendix B gives the panel structure
of the estimation sample.
Sorting …rms by average number of workers and looking at the distribution of workers across …rms, we observe
4 workers per …rm for …rms in the …rst quartile, 10 workers per …rm for …rms in the second quartile and 26
workers per …rm for …rms in the third quartile. The number of observations per worker (…rm) is 3 (8) for the
…rst quartile of workers (…rms), 5 (11) for the second quartile and 9 (14) for the third quartile.
Our empirical rent-sharing analysis is restricted to those industries that are characterized by imperfect
competition in the product market and e¢ cient bargaining the labor market according to the productivity
approach. The IC-EB-sample consists of 60,294 employees (58% of the estimation sample) working in 9,849
…rms (66% of the estimation sample). Using the matched worker-…rm panel, the wage wj(i)t refers to the
average net nominal wage per worker-year. In addition to de…ning the wage at the worker level, we compute
the …rm average wage per worker directly from the …rm accounting information as the wage bill divided by
the average number of employees in each …rm for each year (wit ). Our pro…ts-per-employee variable N it
is drawn from the …rm-level panel and is measured by value added minus labor costs divided by the average
number of employees in each …rm for each year. Given the high volatility of …rm pro…tability, we use the

Average rent-sharing parameters in IC-EB-industries

The di¤erent measures of rent sharing for each of the 25 IC-EB-industries obtained from the labor economics
approach are presented in Table 3. We consider two sets of estimates. The …rst set results from estimating
K
ln wj(i)t = 0 + 1 ln wit + "w ln g
N it + 2 ln L it + j(i) + i + t + jt using the SYS-GMM estimator. In
N
these estimates, we control for inter…rm di¤erences in workers’skills. We denote these rent-sharing estimates
by superscript “lab,ww ”. The second set does not control for skill di¤erences across wage bargains and
K
estimates ln wit = 0 + 1 ln wit + "w ln g
N it + 2 ln L it + i + t + it using the SYS-GMM estimator.
N
In the second speci…cation, we do not take into account that high-pro…t …rms may pay higher wages because
they employ high-skilled workers, not because their wages are higher for workers of a given ability. We only
indirectly control for di¤erences in …rms’labor composition through including capital intensity as a regressor.
We denote these rent-sharing estimates by superscript “lab,fw ”. Comparing both sets of results gives insights
into the importance of this omitted variable problem.
For each set of results, the left part of Table 3 reports the average industry-speci…c wage-pro…t elasticity

Using the labor economics approach, the identi…cation of the industry-speci…c extent of rent-sharing parameter –which are comparable to the productivity approach– is hence driven by di¤erences between the

for the bottom quartile and higher than 19% for the top quartile. The average and median values of Llab;ww
I
amount to 13% and 11% respectively, meaning that on average a worker who were hypothetically to move
from a low-pro…t to a high-pro…t …rm, would experience a wage increase of 13% ceteris paribus. Focusing
on the …rst variant of rent-sharing parameters, we do not …nd evidence of rent sharing for the …rst quartile

industries but estimate the absolute extent of rent-sharing parameter
to be higher than 0.20 for

the top quartile. The average and median values of I
are estimated at 0.10 and 0.08 respectively.
The second variant results in rent-sharing parameters which are about 23% lower than those using the …rst
variant.
Does not controlling for inter…rm skill di¤erences generate an upward bias in the price-quantity, i.e. wagepro…tability, relationship as found in the literature? To answer this question, we focus on the wage estimates
using a …rm’s average wage as the dependent variable. We con…rm that not taking into account skill di¤erences
across wage bargains results in higher wage-pro…t elasticity estimates (about 30% higher). More speci…cally,
the wage-pro…t elasticity

"w

is estimated to be lower than 0.027 for the …rst quartile of industries
lab;f w

and higher than 0.057 for the top quartile. The average and median values of "w
are both estimated
N
I
at about 0.046. As a result, we observe an increase in Lester’s range of wages due to rent sharing. On
average, Lester’s range increases from 13% to 19% when not taking account of systematic sorting of highlab;f w
ability workers in high-pro…t …rms. The absolute extent of rent sharing
is estimated to be lower
I
than 0.10 for the …rst quartile of industries and higher than 0.27 for the top quartile. The average and median
lab;f w
values of I
are both estimated at 0.16.
How do these elasticity estimates match up with other studies? Drawing on …rm-level data, the estimated
elasticity between wages and pro…ts per worker ranges between 0.01 and 0.30. Using data on Anglo-Saxon
countries, Carruth and Oswald (1987), Denny and Machin (1991), Christo…des and Oswald (1992), Blanch‡ower et al. (1996) and Hildreth and Oswald (1997) …nd a central elasticity estimate of 0.04. These low
estimates could be the result of not (adequately) controlling for the endogeneity of rents. Con…rming this
presumption, Abowd and Lemieux (1993) for Canada, Teal (1996) for Ghana, Van Reenen (1996) for the
UK and Estevao and Tevlin (2003) for the US report an elasticity estimate between 0.15 and 0.30. Studies
drawing on matched employer-employee data report lower estimates. Margolis and Salvanes (2001) for France
and Norway, and Arai (2003) for Sweden …nd an elasticity estimate in the [0:01-0:03]-range. Using a crosssection of manufacturing workers, Fakhfakh and FitzRoy (2004) point to an elasticity of 0.02 for France. For
Belgium, Rycx and Tojerow (2004) and Du Caju et al. (2011) obtain an elasticity estimate of 0.06 and 0.03,
respectively. Guertzgen (2009) and Martins (2009) …nd an wage-pro…t elasticity varying between 0.02 and
0.07 for Germany and Portugal, respectively. Note, however, that these studies consider all manufacturing
industries while our focus is on the IC-EB-industries.
We checked the sensitivity of the absolute extent of rent-sharing parameters and Lester’s range of wages
due to rent sharing to (i) the measurement of the alternative wage and (ii) not controlling for di¤erences in
18

…rms’capital intensity. In particular, we measure the alternative wage by either the 1st or the 10th percentile
value of the worker wage distribution of the employing …rm i at time t. This sensitivity check is summarized
in Table B.7 and visualized in Graphs B.1 and B.2 in Appendix B. Let us focus the discussion on the …rst
variant of the median absolute extent of rent-sharing parameter estimates. These estimates only appear to be
sensitive to the choice of the alternative wage value when controlling for systematic sorting of unobservably
high-ability workers into high-pro…t …rms (see Graph B.1a). As expected, we …nd that a decrease in the
lab;ww
increases from 0.08 to
alternative wage value increases the median absolute extent of rent sharing ( I
lab;ww
0.11) whilst the opposite holds for an increase in the alternative wage value ( I
decreases from 0.08 to
0.04). Not controlling for di¤erences in …rms’ capital intensity signi…cantly increases the median absolute
extent of rent-sharing parameter estimates. This is true irrespective of whether or not taking into account
lab;ww
lab;f w
unobserved worker ability: I
increases from 0.08 to 0.14 and I
from 0.16 to 0.23 (see Graph B.1c).
The same pattern holds when focusing on the impact on Lester’s range of wages due to rent sharing (see
Graphs B.2a and B.2b).

Accounting approach
Theoretical framework

This section discusses the accounting approach to recovering the extent of rent sharing. From a conceptual
point of view, the accounting approach is similar to the labor economics approach in terms of being compatible
with worker-…rm negotiations that di¤er in terms of bargaining scope. Indeed, dividing the equilibrium
wage-pro…t relation [Eq. (19)] – which is independent of the true nature of the employment function– by
total revenue (Rit ) and de…ning the wage premium as the di¤erence between the bargained wage and the
alternative wage in the event of a bargaining dispute, wit wit , we compute directly the relative and absolute
acc
extents of rent sharing acc

Data requirements: Firm-level panel

Similar to the productivity approach, the accounting approach allows to uncover industry-speci…c rent-sharing
parameters from production data with only information on production values, usage of variable inputs and
input costs, therefore only exploiting the …rm-level panel. Contrary to the productivity approach, however,
the accounting approach requires a measure of the alternative wage (wit ), which we proxy by the 5th percentile
value of the …rm wage distribution in the industry in which the …rm operates. In addition to the variables
discussed in Sections 2.3 and 3.3, Table 1 reports the mean, standard deviation and quartile values of the
labor share computed at the alternative wage ( N )it and the wage premium (wit wit ).

4.3

Average rent-sharing parameters in IC-EB-industries

From Eq. (31), it is clear that variations in the wedge between the wage premium of all employees and the
…rm’s short-run pro…t identify the relative extent of rent sharing. For each industry within the IC-EBregime, the left part of Table 4 presents the distribution of the …rm-speci…c relative and absolute extent of
acc
rent-sharing parameters ( acc
it and it , respectively), which highlights within-industry variation in the extent
of rent sharing. The industries in Table 4 are ranked according to the median value of acc
it . Focusing on the
acc
median distribution, the absolute extent of rent-sharing (median value of it ) is computed to be lower than
0.27 for the …rst quartile of industries and higher than 0.36 for the upper quartile. The average and median
values are both equal to 0.32. The right part of Table 4 reports the corresponding average industry-speci…c
wage-pro…t elasticities and Lester’s range of wages due to rent sharing. Consistent with the productivity
approach, we consider for each of them two variants. Focusing on the …rst variant, we …nd an average
(median) wage-pro…t elasticity and Lester statistic that is about 8% (25%) higher than the corresponding
acc

estimate based on the productivity approach. In particular, the wage-pro…t elasticity

"w

N

I

is computed

to be lower than 0.28 for the bottom quartile of industries and higher than 0.33 for the top quartile. The
acc

average and median values of "w

N

I

are both computed to be 0.31, implying that on average a doubling of

pro…ts per employee increases ceteris paribus average …rm wages by 31%. Lester’s range of wages due to rent
sharing is lower than 0.95 for the …rst quartile of industries and higher than 1.38 for the top quartile. The
acc
average and median values of LI amount to 1.27 and 1.25 respectively. Hence, on average, it appears that
the wage of a worker would increase by 127% if she moved from a low-pro…t to a high-pro…t …rm, keeping all
her other characteristics unchanged.
<Insert Table 4 about here>
How sensitive are the absolute extent of rent-sharing parameters and Lester’s range of wages due to rent
sharing to the measurement of the alternative wage? We compare the baseline computation of the absolute
st
or the
extent of rent sharing (median value of acc
it ) to 5 di¤erent values of the alternative wage: the 1
th
st
th
th
10 percentile value of the …rm wage distribution, or the 1 , 5 or 10 percentile value of the worker wage
distribution.14 This sensitivity check is reported in Table B.7 and visualized in Graph B.3 in Appendix B.
Focusing on the computation of the absolute extent of rent sharing, we …nd that decreasing the alternative
wage value based on the …rm wage distribution increases the median absolute extent of rent sharing from 0.32
to 0.42, whilst an increase in the alternative wage value decrease this rent-sharing parameter from 0.32 to 0.26.
Measuring the alternative wage based on the worker wage distribution leads to a large increase in the rentsharing parameter (from 0.32 to 0.55). The magnitude of the increase does not depend on the percentile value
of the worker wage distribution (see Graph B.3a). The same pattern holds when evaluating the sensitivity
acc
of the baseline computation of Lester’s range of wages (LI ) to di¤erent values of the alternative wage (see
Graph B.3b).
1 4 Measuring

the alternative wage based on the worker wage distribution evidently requires resorting to the matched worker-…rm

panel.

A comparison of rent-sharing parameters across approaches

How sizeable are di¤erences in average measures of rent sharing across the productivity approach, the labor
economics approach and the accounting approach for industries within the IC-EB-regime? To highlight
these di¤erences, which can be attributable to di¤erences in the sources of identi…cation of the rent-sharing
parameters and to di¤erences in modeling assumptions, Table 5 presents the distribution of relative and
absolute extent of rent-sharing parameters, wage-pro…t elasticities and Lester’s range of wages due to rent
sharing across the three approaches. In this section, we concentrate on the …rst variant of the relevant
rent-sharing parameters.
Given that we take the productivity approach as our benchmark, we …rst focus the discussion on the industryspeci…c absolute extent of rent-sharing parameters. Looking at within-approach industry di¤erences in this
rent-sharing parameter, we observe the most sizeable dispersion within the labor economics approach using
worker wages as the dependent variable (interquartile range of 0.20) and the smallest dispersion within the
accounting approach (interquartile range of 0.10). Hence, as expected, exploiting the worker-…rm information
clearly widens the distribution of absolute extent of rent sharing parameters. Looking at industry di¤erences
in this rent-sharing parameter across approaches, the median value varies between 0.08 and 0.32. Taking
into account non-random sorting of high-ability (and thus high-wage) workers into high-pro…t …rms, we …nd
an average absolute rent-sharing parameter of 0.08. Not controlling for interemployer di¤erences in workers’
skills within the labor economics approach results in a doubling of this median parameter (value of 0.16).
Moving to either the productivity or the accounting approach leads to another doubling of this value (value
of 0.29 or 0.32, respectively).
Recall that obtaining wage-pro…t elasticities from relative extent of rent-sharing parameter estimates using
either the productivity or the accounting approach requires multiplying the latter by the average smoothed
ratio of pro…ts to the wage bill. Sizeable industry variation in this ratio causes di¤erences in absolute
extent of rent sharing parameters across approaches to be mapped into even larger di¤erences in wagepro…t elasticities.15 Looking at industry di¤erences in the latter across approaches, the median wage-pro…t
elasticity is estimated to range between 0.035 (labor economics approach controlling for unobserved worker
ability) and 0.30 (accounting approach). The wage-pro…t elasticities based on either the productivity or
the accounting approach are 6 (8) times larger than the ones based on the labor economics approach not
controlling (controlling) for unobserved worker heterogeneity. Within the labor economics approach, our
results show that not controlling for skill di¤erences across wage bargains increase the average responsiveness
of wages to …rm pro…tability by 50%.
These sizeable wage-pro…t elasticity di¤erences across approaches have important consequences when it comes
to evaluating the contribution of variability in …rm pro…tability to observed wage inequality. Recall that,
for each of the three approaches, Lester’s range of wages due to rent sharing is obtained by multiplying the
wage-pro…t elasticities by four times the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean value of smoothed pro…ts
1 5 More speci…cally, the average smoothed ratio of pro…ts to the wage bill is lower than 0.51 for the …rst quartile of IC-EBindustries and higher than 0.87 for the upper quartile. The average and median values of this ratio are computed to be 0.70
and 0.61, respectively.

21

per employee.16 As the average of this ratio is about 1, the median value of Lester’s range of wages due to
rent sharing –measuring the implications on wages due to a movement from the bottom to the top of the
pro…ts distribution which is assumed to have a width of four standard deviations–varies between 11% (labor
economics approach controlling for unobserved worker ability) and 123% (accounting approach).
<Insert Table 5 about here>
To illustrate the di¤erences in rent-sharing behavior across the three approaches graphically, Graphs 1 and 2
present box diagrams for the relative and absolute extent of rent-sharing parameters, wage pro…t elasticities
and Lester’s range of wages due to rent sharing by approach within the IC-EB-regime. Graph 1 shows the
…rst variant of the relevant parameters whereas Graph 2 displays the second variant.
<Insert Graphs 1 & 2 about here>
Table 6 presents a matrix giving the correlations between all pairs of the di¤erent rent-sharing measures.
Two types of correlations are reported: Spearman’s rank correlation coe¢ cients and biweight midcorrelation
coe¢ cients. The latter, which is based on Wilcox (2005), gives a correlation that is less sensitive to outliers
and therefore more robust. Focusing on the absolute extent of rent-sharing parameters, Table 6 reports a
strong and signi…cantly positive correlation between (i) prod

Rent sharing introduces allocative ine¢ ciencies into an economy through distorting factor prices. Therefore,
identifying and quantifying this potential type of market failure is important for both academic research
and policy analysis. The three approaches discussed above are based on di¤erent statistical and economic
assumptions which drive the observed rent-sharing di¤erences across approaches.17 As such, our analysis
makes clear that the three approaches face important trade-o¤s. The big advantages of the productivity
approach are that only standard production data are required to recover rent-sharing parameters, there
is no need to measure the user cost of capital or the alternative wage, nor is it necessary to assume a
constant-returns-to scale production function. Measuring the user cost of capital has proven to be di¢ cult
1 6 This ratio is lower than 0.88 for the …rst quartile of IC-EB-industries and higher than 1.11 for the upper quartile. The
average and median values of this ratio are computed to be 1.01 and 0.97, respectively.
1 7 We consider addressing/testing empirically the di¤erent sets of assumptions of the three approaches as an interesting avenue
for future research but beyond the scope of this paper.

and necessitates ad hoc assumptions on capital markets and on how …rms depreciate their assets whilst
imposing constant returns to scale assumes that every increase in inputs leads to a proportional increase
in output. The productivity approach comes, however, at the cost of imposing a particular bargaining
scope (bargaining issues involve wage and employment) and a Cobb-Douglas production function. The labor
economics approach entails the advantage of being compatible with worker-…rm negotiations that di¤er in
terms of bargaining scope and puts no restrictions on the functional form of the production function. In
order to control for interemployer di¤erences in workers’ skills, the researcher has to rely on a matched
worker-…rm panel. In addition, one needs to choose a particular measurement of the workers’ alternative
wage. Similar to the productivity approach, the accounting approach has the merit of only relying on …rm
accounting information. Similar to the labor economics approach, the derived rent-sharing parameters are
independent of the true nature of the employment function. Notable disadvantages are that the researcher
has to assume a constant-returns-to-scale production function and a particular measurement of the workers’
alternative wage.18
The main message of our results is that the use of the di¤erent approaches should depend on the data
at hand and the speci…c research question we are trying to answer. Conditional on being interested in
an average rent-sharing parameter across a speci…ed set of producers, the productivity approach proves
particularly useful (i) when it comes to analyzing how changes in the operating environment of …rms –such
as e.g. privatization and deregulation, investments in R&D and ICT, trade liberalization and fragmentation
of production chains– a¤ect the division of surplus between capital and labor, (ii) to assess simultaneously
the impact of such shifters on both …rms’price-cost mark-up and workers’rent-sharing parameters and (iii)
to examine the extent to which product and labor market imperfections might impact aggregate TFP via
generating misallocation of resources. Freeing up the data requirements, the productivity approach lends
itself to a comparative analysis (at the cross-country/cross-industry/cross-…rm-group level). Taking into
account worker heterogeneity, the labor economics approach is well suited for (i) assessing the extent to
which the wage-pro…t relation varies across groups of workers that di¤er in terms of e.g. gender, tenure or
skill level, (ii) evaluating the contribution of these group di¤erences in rent sharing to gender and other
types of wage inequality and (iii) analyzing the e¤ect of changes in …rm-level decision variables –such as
di¤erent types of innovations, exporting, product introduction– on workers’ bargaining power. Leaving
aside the closed-economy perspective, the labor economics approach also allows to examine the relative
importance of domestic versus international rent sharing in determining workers’wage outcomes after e.g. a
cross-border merger or acquisition. Without having to deal with the many challenges in econometric methods
and techniques, the accounting approach provides a basic measure of rent sharing based on …rm accounting
information only.
So far, we have based our comparison on the IC-EB-industries with the purpose of selecting industries
where rent-sharing behavior is likely to be observed. For reasons of completeness, Table B.8 in Appendix
B reports the distribution of absolute extent of rent-sharing parameters and Lester’s range of wages due to
rent sharing across the three approaches for the two other predominant regimes (P C-M O and IC-P R).19
1 8 Note that in the accounting approach, the constant-returns-to-scale assumption could be relaxed if the researcher is willing
to measure the user cost of capital.

When controlling for the systematic sorting of unobservably high-ability workers into high-pro…t …rms, the
median values of both rent-sharing measures based on the labor economics approach are found to be the
highest for IC-EB-industries and the lowest for P C-M O-industries. The median values of both rent-sharing
measures are estimated to be the highest for IC-P R-industries and the lowest for P C-M O-industries when
not controlling for unobserved worker ability in the labor economics approach. Only minor di¤erences in
the distribution of both rent-sharing measures across the predominant regimes are observed when using the
accounting approach.20

Conclusion

Empirical labor economists have resorted to estimating the responsiveness of workers’wages to …rms’ability
to pay to assess the extent to which employers share rents with their employees. This paper compares this
labor economics approach with two other approaches that rely on standard micro production data only: the
productivity approach for which estimates of the output elasticities of labor and materials and data on the
respective revenue shares are needed and the accounting approach which boils down to directly computing
the extent of rent sharing from …rm accounting information.
Using an unbalanced panel of 103,995 employees working in 14,921 …rms belonging to 52 manufacturing
industries over the period 1984-2001 in France, we take the productivity approach as our benchmark and
select the subset of industries where rent sharing behavior is most likely to be observed, i.e. industries that are
characterized by imperfect competition in the product market and e¢ cient bargaining in the labor market.
For these 25 IC-EB-industries, we provide micro evidence on rent sharing from orthogonal directions by
exploiting di¤erent dimensions in the data. We …nd a median absolute extent of rent sharing of about
0.30 using either the productivity or the accounting approach. Only using …rm-level information brings this
median rent-sharing parameter down to 0.16 using the labor economics approach. Controlling for unobserved
worker ability, thereby considering the possibility that high-ability workers might be systematically sorted
into high-pro…t …rms, further reduces the median absolute extent of rent sharing to 0.08. Our results con…rm
that the three di¤erent approaches face important trade-o¤s in terms of statistical and economic assumptions.
The main message of this article is that empirical economists interested in establishing that pro…ts are shared
should select the appropriate approach based on the particular research question and on the data at hand.
Our …ndings raise possible directions for future work. Both the productivity and the labor economics approach
are reduced-form approaches. First, an evident continuation is to align both approaches by setting up
a simultaneous equations model composed of a production function, a demand function, a pricing rule,
cost share equations for variable input factors (taking into account some type of worker heterogeneity) and
separate wage equations for di¤erent groups of workers. Second, similar to comparing rent-sharing estimates
derived from the productivity approach and the labor economics approach, it would be interesting to examine
di¤erences between wage elasticity estimates of the labor supply to …rms recovered from the productivity
approach and those obtained by regressing the decision to separate from a …rm on an individual worker’s
M O-industries.
2 0 We might tentatively conclude from this observation that the accounting approach is far less capable of detecting di¤erences
in rent-sharing behavior across regimes.

wage (wage elasticities of separations), the latter being a standard practice in the empirical labor economics
literature. Third, following Fitzenberger (2014) in his comments on Alison Booth’s (Booth, 2014) survey
paper on “Wage determination and imperfect competition”, a challenging extension of our productivity
approach would be to go beyond the simple dichotomy of either consolidating market power on the supply
side of labor or consolidating market power on the demand side by integrating wage determination under
trade unions and wage determination under oligopsonistic competition.
