    "abstract": "\n\nMortgage applications are a detailed and accurate source of household information that is verified by underwriters, making it a more accurate data source than self-reported survey answers.  This paper discusses how mortgage data can be applied to areas of economics outside mortgage finance.  As a supplement to variables from the application form, the self-selection of mortgage points is used to infer expected mobility.  A duration model of housing spells is estimated, and the points indicator is shown to be highly significant in predicting mobility for low loan-to-value borrowers.  The findings demonstrate the potential fruitfulness of using this new data source.\n\n",
