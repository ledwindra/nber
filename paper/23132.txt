The Recent Growth Boom in Developing Economies: A Structural Change Perspective

NBER Working Paper No. 23132
February 2017
JEL No. O1,O11,O4
ABSTRACT
Growth has accelerated in a wide range of developing countries over the last couple of decades,
resulting in an extraordinary period of convergence with the advanced economies. We analyze
this experience from the lens of structural change – the reallocation of labor from low- to highproductivity sectors. Patterns of structural change differ greatly in the recent growth experience.
In contrast to the East Asian experience, none of the recent growth accelerations in Latin
America, Africa, or South Asia was driven by rapid industrialization. Beyond that, we document
that recent growth accelerations were based on either rapid within-sector labor productivity
growth (Latin America) or growth-increasing structural change (Africa), but rarely both at the
same time. The African experience is particularly intriguing, as growth-enhancing structural
change appears to have come typically at the expense of declining labor productivity growth in
the more modern sectors of the economy. We explain this anomaly by arguing that the forces that
promoted structural change in Africa originated on the demand side, through either external
transfers or increase in agricultural incomes. In contrast to Asia, structural change was the result
of increased demand for goods and services produced in the modern sectors of the economy
rather than productivity improvements in these sectors.

The Recent Growth Boom in Developing Economies: A Structural-Change Perspective
Xinshen Diao, Margaret McMillan, and Dani Rodrik
January 2017

1. Introduction
Developing countries have experienced an extraordinary period of economic development over
the last couple of decades. Beside India and China, which registered record economic growth rates,
countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America have managed to match or exceed their performance of
the 1960s and first half of the 1970s. The recent downturn in the global economy has cast a dark shadow
on the future of this performance, and Latin America in particular has been badly hit by the decline in
commodity prices. But growth in the low-income countries of Africa has been resilient and remains high.
Even a cursory look at the experience of the recent growth champions indicates that their
experience differs greatly from the standard East Asian path. East Asian countries such as South Korea,
Taiwan, and China grew through rapid export-oriented industrialization. By contrast, none of the recent
growth experiences outside East Asia show evidence of rapid industrialization. Instead, Latin American
countries have experienced premature de-industrialization, while in Africa manufacturing industries are
barely holding their own in most countries.
How do we understand this recent wave of economic growth in developing countries? What have
been the main drivers, and how sustainable are they? We offer a structuralist perspective on this recent
experience, focusing on the role of structural change in driving economywide labor productivity growth. In
East Asian countries, the movement of labor from low-productivity agriculture and informality to modern
manufacturing industries and associated activities played a critical role. Was there a similar transformation
in the recent crop of growth accelerations? Even if industrialization did not play a substantial role, did the
expansion of other modern activities such as services, substitute for it? And what has been the relationship
between patterns of structural change and labor productivity growth within specific sectors or the “within”
component of economywide labor productivity growth?
We begin by reviewing and updating some of the stylized facts in McMillan and Rodrik (2011) on
structural dualism in developing nations and relating the structuralist perspective to the neoclassical
growth model (section 2). We then turn to recent episodes of growth acceleration in Latin America, Africa,
1

and India (section 3). We decompose labor productivity growth during these episodes into two terms:
within-sector productivity growth and inter-sectoral labor reallocation.
Our most interesting finding is that recent growth accelerations were based on either rapid withinsector labor productivity growth (Latin America) or growth-increasing structural change (Africa), but
rarely both at the same time (section 4). There is a strong negative correlation between the two
components of growth across countries, with India as the sole exception. In Latin America, within-sector
labor productivity growth has been impressive, but growth-promoting structural change has been very
weak. In fact, structural change has made a negative contribution to overall growth excluding agriculture,
meaning labor has moved from high-productivity sectors to low-productivity activities. In Africa, the
situation is the mirror image of the Latin American case. Growth-promoting structural change has been
significant, especially in Ethiopia, Malawi, Senegal, and Tanzania. But this has been accompanied in
these countries by negative labor productivity growth within non-agricultural sectors.
We also show in section 4 that this experience stands in sharp contrast with the classic East
Asian growth experience (such as in South Korea and China), in which both components of labor
productivity contributed strongly to overall growth. Moreover, the East Asian pattern seems to be
replicated in more recent Asian cases of growth accelerations as well (in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos,
and Vietnam, and India as mentioned earlier).
The Latin American pattern of weak or negative structural change was noted and discussed in
McMillan and Rodrik (2011), and related to the region’s commodity dependence, overvalued exchange
rates, (relatively) low agricultural employment shares, and de-industrialization. But the African pattern is
puzzling. Rapid growth-promoting structural change has become a feature of the African economic
landscape – something that was not evident in the data in McMillan and Rodrik (2011) – which is surely
good news. It is also somewhat surprising, given that industrialization has not figure prominently in the
region. But it now comes at the expense of declining labor productivity growth in the more modern
sectors of the economy. How can we make sense of this anomaly?
We develop a simple two-sector general equilibrium model in section 5 to shed light on regional
patterns of structural change, especially the contrast between the African and Asian models. We make
specific assumptions on preferences, namely that demand is non-homothetic (with a declining budget
share of the traditional sector) and the modern sector good is price elastic. We show that the Asian
pattern of strong “within” and “between” components is consistent with growth being driven mainly by
2

positive productivity shocks to the modern sectors. The model generates a positive correlation between
the two components of aggregate labor productivity growth: as the modern sector expands thanks to
the positive productivity shock, it draws labor from the other, less-productive sectors of the economy.
The African model, by contrast, is consistent with growth being driven not by the modern sector,
but by positive aggregate demand shocks (due to foreign transfers, for example) or by productivity
growth in the traditional sector (agriculture). In this model, the modern sector expands and growthpromoting structural change takes place as increased demand spills over to the modern sector. (Our
assumptions on preferences ensure that demand shifts are sufficiently biased towards the modern
sector to ensure the modern sector expands in both cases, despite relative-price adjustments.) But labor
productivity in the modern sector is driven down as a by-product, as diminishing returns to capital set in
and less productive firms are drawn in. This is also consistent with the relatively poor performance of
manufacturing in Africa.
These considerations suggest that positive structural change in African countries may be driven
mainly from the demand side, whether due to external transfers or the induced demand effects from
increased agricultural incomes. This in turn raises the question of the sustainability of recent growth, an
issue we discuss in the concluding section.
2. Structural Dualism and Labor Productivity Growth
The concept of structural dualism has its roots in development economics and the work of Lewis
(1954). This work draws a sharp distinction between the traditional and modern sectors of the economy;
accumulation, innovation, and productivity growth all take place in the modern sector while the traditional
sector remains technologically backward and stagnant. Thus, economywide growth depends largely on the
rate at which resources—principally labor—can migrate from the traditional to the modern sector. The
reason that this concept is still so important in the context of developing countries is because the
economies of today’s poor countries are still very much characterized by structural dualism. The
implication of this dualism is that there are potentially large payoffs to moving workers out of the
traditional sector and into the modern sector.
Of course an emphasis on structural dualism does not imply that there is no role for the
neoclassical growth model first introduced by Solow (1956). But it is the process of structural change
whereby resources flow from less to more productive activities that tends to fuel rapid growth in the
3

earliest stages of development. By contrast, in neoclassical models, growth depends on the incentives to
save, accumulate physical and human capital, and (in subsequent variants that endogenize technological
change) innovate by developing new products and processes (Grossman and Helpman 1991; Aghion and
Howitt 1992). The two channels may have common determinants. For example, improved incentives to
invest and adopt new technologies in the modern sector may enable the sector to expand and absorb
labor from the traditional sector. But the two models emphasize different processes as being critical to
growth.
These traditions offer complementary perspectives on economic growth (Rodrik 2014). One way
to combine their insights is to think of the neoclassical model as essentially focusing on the growth process
within modern sectors, while the dual-economy model focuses on relationships and flows among sectors.
Each perspective provides a distinct logic behind growth in the lagging countries. In what follows we first
present evidence which strongly suggests that dualism is alive and well in developing countries. We then
lay out our conceptual framework for thinking about the sources of growth that incorporates both the dual
economy and neo-classical models of growth.
A. Structural dualism: the data
Our evidence on structural dualism is based on the 10-sector database produced by researchers
at the Groningen Growth and Development Center (GGDC). We use the most recent version of the data
which were last updated in January 2015 (Timmer, de Vries, and de Vries 2015). These data consist of
sectoral and aggregate employment and real value-added statistics for 30 developing countries and 9
high-income countries covering the period up to 2010 and, for some countries, to 2011 or 2012. The
countries and their geographical distribution are shown in Table 1, along with some summary statistics.
We compute labor productivity by dividing each sector’s real value added by the corresponding level of
sectoral employment. The sectoral breakdown we use in the rest of the paper is shown in Table 2.
Using the GGDC data to compute average labor productivity by sector raises some important
measurement issues. The first has to do with the extent to which the GGDC data accounts for the
informal sector. The data for value-added come from national accounts, and as mentioned by Timmer
and de Vries (2007, 2009), the coverage of such data varies from country to country. While all countries
make an effort to track the informal sector, obviously the quality of the data can vary greatly. On
employment, Timmer and de Vries (2007, 2009) relied on population censuses for total employment
levels and their sectoral distribution; they used labor force surveys for the growth in employment
4

between census years. Census data and other household surveys tend to have more complete coverage
of informal employment. In short, a rough characterization of the data would be that the employment
numbers in the GGDC dataset broadly coincide with actual employment levels, regardless of formality
status, while the extent to which value-added data include or exclude the informal sector heavily
depends on the quality of national sources. For a detailed explanation of the protocols followed to
compile the GGDC 10-Sector database, refer to Timmer, de Vries, and de Vries (2015) and “Sources and
Methods” at the database’s web page: http://www.ggdc.net/databases/10_sector.htm.
The second concern -- and one that has gotten a lot of attention in recent literature 1 -- is that
the quality of the data collected by national statistical agencies in poor countries and Africa in particular
is not very good. Like Diao, Harttgen and McMillan (2017) our confidence in the estimates of value
added at the sectoral level is bolstered by the following facts. First, the African countries included in the
GGDC database are the countries in Africa with the strongest national statistical offices and these
countries have been collecting national accounts data for some time. Second, researchers at the GGDC
specialize in providing consistent and harmonized measures of sectoral value added and our view is that
this expertise lends credibility to these numbers. Finally, using LSMS surveys, researchers have shown
that sectoral measures of value added based on national accounts data are highly correlated with
sectoral measures of consumption (Gollin, Lagakos, and Waugh 2014).
The third concern stems from the measurement of labor inputs. Ideally, instead of using the
measured number of workers employed in a sector, we would use the number of hours worked in a
sector. This would correct for biases associated with the seasonality of agriculture that might lead to an
underestimation of agricultural labor productivity. This is a serious issue and for the purposes of this
paper, we rely on work by Duarte and Restuccia (2010) who show that in a sample of 29 developed and
developing countries the correlation between hours worked and employment shares is close to one and
Gollin, Lagakos, and Waugh (2014) who show that correcting labor productivity measures for hours
worked does not overturn the result that labor productivity in agriculture is significantly lower than
labor productivity in the rest of the economy. Note that this does not mean that there are not off-farm

1

See for example Klasen and Blades (2013).

5

activities in rural areas that bring in less income for example than farming. In fact, this is highly likely in
very poor economies where a large share of economic activity is of a subsistence nature. 2
Finally, the productivity gaps we describe here are differences in average labor productivity.
When markets work well and structural constraints do not bind, it is productivities at the margin that
would be equalized. Under a Cobb-Douglas production function specification, the marginal productivity
of labor is the average productivity multiplied by the labor share. Thus, if labor shares differ greatly
across economic activities, then comparing average labor productivities can be misleading. The fact that
average productivity in mining is so high, for example, simply indicates that the labor share in this
capital-intensive sector is quite small. In the case of other sectors, however, there does not appear to be
a clearly significant bias. Once the share of land is taken into account, for example, it is not obvious that
the labor share in agriculture is significantly lower than in manufacturing (Mundlak, Butzer, and Larson
2012). Therefore, the large observed differences in average labor productivity between manufacturing,
say, and agriculture do point to large gaps in marginal productivity.
B. Structural dualism: the evidence
Figure 1 shows that for the 11 African countries in the GGDC sample, the productivity gaps
across sectors are indeed enormous. 3 Each bin in the figure corresponds to one of the nine sectors in
the dataset, 4 with the width of the bin corresponding to the sector’s share of total employment, and the
height corresponding to the sector’s labor productivity level as a fraction of average labor productivity in
the economy. Agriculture, at 35 percent of average productivity, has the lowest productivity by far;
manufacturing productivity is 1.7 times as high, and mining productivity is 16.8 times as high.
Furthermore, the figure makes evident that the majority of employment in the African sample is in the
most unproductive sectors, with roughly two-thirds of the labor force in the two sectors with belowaverage productivity (agriculture and personal services). Based on this figure, it appears that the
potential for structural change to contribute to labor productivity growth is still quite large in most
African countries.
That productivity gaps in Africa are large is not surprising. It is evident from Table 1 that the
least productive countries in our sample are in Africa. In previous work (McMillan and Rodrik, 2011), we
2

Using LSMS-ISA data McCullough (2015) finds that correcting for hours worked reduces the gap between labor
productivity in agriculture and in other activities significantly but she provides no explanation for the large
difference between her results and the results of Gollin, Lagakos, and Waugh (2014).

showed that these productivity gaps tend to shrink as countries get richer. We provide updated
evidence on this relationship in Figure 2. The coefficient of variation is recorded on the vertical axis and
the log of real value added per worker is recorded on the horizontal axis. Not surprisingly, extending the
sample to 2010 does not alter our main insight; as countries get richer the gaps in labor productivity
across sectors shrinks. The implication is that there is relatively more scope for achieving labor
productivity gains in poor countries by moving labor out of agriculture and into other more productive
sectors.
The way this process evolves tells us something important about the process of development.
McMillan and Rodrik (2011) documented that the productivity gap between the agricultural and
nonagricultural sectors of the economy follow a U-shaped relationship. The economic logic behind this
relationship is intuitive. In very poor countries with few modern industries the productivity gap between
agriculture and the rest of the economy is low. As new activities start to take place in the modern sector
the gap starts to widen and the economy becomes more dual (Kuznets, 1955). As labor starts to move
from the traditional sector to the modern sector productivity starts to converge between the two
sectors. As noted by McMillan and Rodrik (2011) this story highlights two key dynamics of structural
transformation: the rise of new industries (i.e. economic diversification) and the movement of resources
from traditional industries to these new industries. Without the first, there is little that propels the
economy forward. Without the second, productivity gains don’t diffuse in the rest of the economy.
Of course these are broad patterns in the data and our story is about the way things should
work if the process of development is on track. If we dig a little bit deeper, we can learn more about
how the process of structural change is evolving across countries. To do this, we start with a little bit of
algebra that clarifies the forces at work described in the previous paragraph. Let the relative productivity
of the agricultural sector (RPA) be defined as follows:
(1)
𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉

𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 =

where 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖 = 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖 and 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 =

𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖
𝑙𝑙

𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐴𝐴
𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑁𝑁

=

𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝐴𝐴
𝐿𝐿𝐴𝐴

�𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑁𝑁 =
𝐿𝐿𝑁𝑁

𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝐴𝐴
𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑁𝑁

�𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐴𝐴

𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑁𝑁

denote shares of value added and employment in sector i respectively.

What happens to the RPA over the course of development? To understand this, we focus on the

last term in equation (1). The rise of new industries increases value added in the nonagricultural sector
which on its own lowers the numerator causing the RPA to fall. At the same time however, attracted by
new opportunities in the nonagricultural sector, labor exits agriculture and the employment share in
7

agriculture falls which in turn raises relative labor productivity in the agricultural sector. Thus, the RPA
only falls in the early stages of development when productivity growth in the nonagricultural sector
outpaces the countervailing forces which work to raise the RPA.
Very few countries in our sample actually fit this pattern but they are big countries. Figure 3
shows that this happened in China and India but for different reasons. 5 In China, very rapid productivity
growth in manufacturing occurred alongside structural change. As Wei and Zhang (2011) have shown,
the bulk of this productivity growth was a result of the entry of new private firms into the manufacturing
sector. This rapid productivity growth in manufacturing outpaced labor exits from agriculture thereby
lowering the RPA. By contrast, in the case of India, recent rapid productivity growth in the modern
services sector (e.g., IT) outpaced shifts in employment shares primarily because such modern services
employ relatively few workers and so employment shares did not change all that much.
The more typical pattern in the data for a developing country is a long period (20-40 years)
where the counterbalancing forces keep the RPA fairly constant. We show this pattern for Chile and
Thailand in Figure 4. In the case of Thailand, the RPA hovered around 0.10 for almost 40 years and it is
only in the past 10 years or so that it has started to inch upward at a level of economywide labor
productivity over 10,000 PPP USD. The pattern is not that different for Chile although the data for Chile
start at a much higher income level. In general, the RPA only starts to increase when shifts in
employment from agriculture to nonagriculture become minimal and agricultural labor productivity
growth starts to outpace productivity growth in the nonagricultural sector. This pattern can be seen for
the United States in Figure 4 and is typical of the developed countries in our sample. But it is also
evident in a number of middle income developing countries in Asia and Latin America.
A different pattern seems to be emerging in a number of poor African countries. We show this
pattern for Ethiopia, Malawi and Tanzania in Figure 4. In all three countries, the RPA seems to be
trending upward but at very low levels of economywide labor productivity. Since we know that the
employment share in agriculture has fallen over time in these three countries, the trend upward in the
RPA implies that labor productivity in agriculture is growing more rapidly than labor productivity in the
nonagricultural sector. This is the same pattern we see in developed countries but at much higher levels
of income. In poor countries like Ethiopia, Malawi and Tanzania, we expect labor productivity in the

The RPA also fell in Nigeria but this is driven solely by extremely high productivity in the oil sector without any
meaningful structural changes.

modern sector to grow more rapidly than or at least at the same rate as labor productivity in agriculture.
We return to this point later in the paper.
C. A formalization of the two growth traditions
While structural dualism is clearly an important feature of developing countries, a complete
accounting of labor productivity growth must take into account the fact that labor productivity growth
can be achieved in one of two ways. First, productivity can grow within existing economic activities
through capital accumulation or technological change. Second, labor can move from low-productivity to
high-productivity activities, increasing overall labor productivity in the economy. Following McMillan
and Rodrik (2011) we express these two components of labor productivity growth using the following
decomposition:
∆𝑦𝑦 𝑡𝑡 = ∑𝑖𝑖 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 ∆𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 + ∑𝑖𝑖 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 ∆𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 ,

(2)

where 𝑦𝑦 𝑡𝑡 and 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 refer to economywide and sectoral labor productivity levels, respectively, and 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 is the

share of employment in sector i. The Δ operator denotes the change in productivity or employment
shares between t-k and t and 𝑡𝑡 > 𝑘𝑘. The first term in the decomposition is the weighted sum of

productivity growth within individual sectors, where the weights are the employment share of each
sector at the beginning of the period. As in McMillan and Rodrik (2011), we call this the “within”
component of productivity growth. The second term captures the productivity effect of labor
reallocations across different sectors. It is the inner product of productivity levels (at the end of the
period), with the change in employment shares across sectors. We call this second term the “structural

change” term.
The second term in equation (2) could be further decomposed into a static and dynamic
component of structural change, as in de Vries, Timmer and de Vries (2015). We choose not to go that
route here because the dynamic component of the structural change term is often negative and difficult
to interpret. For example, when agricultural productivity growth is positive and the labor share in
agriculture is falling, the term is negative, even though, on average, the movement of workers out of
agriculture to other more productive sectors of the economy makes a positive contribution to structural
change and economywide labor productivity growth. Moreover, structural change is, by its very nature,
a dynamic phenomenon; thus, we find it counterintuitive to label a part of structural change static.

9

The decomposition we use clarifies how partial analyses of productivity performance within
individual sectors (for example, manufacturing) can be misleading when there are large differences in
labor productivities (𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 ) across economic activities. In particular, a high rate of productivity growth

within a sector can have ambiguous implications for overall economic performance if the sector’s share
of employment shrinks rather than expands. If the displaced labor ends up in activities with lower

productivity, economywide growth will suffer and may even turn negative. This has been an important
reason for poor economywide productivity growth in Latin America, where modern sectors have
performed very well, but without expanding their share of the economy’s labor force (McMillan and
Rodrik 2011).
This decomposition can be used to study broad patterns of structural change within a country
and across countries. An example of this type of analysis can be found in McMillan and Rodrik (2011).
We provide a brief discussion of growth decomposition methodologies and the method used in this
paper in the Appendix. Individual components of the decomposition such as labor shares and withinsector changes in productivity can also be used at the country level to dig deeper into where structural
change is or is not taking place and to gain a deeper understanding of the country-specific factors that
drive structural change. For example, if we know that the expansion of manufacturing is a characteristic
of structural change in a particular country, we could use more detailed data on manufacturing to
pinpoint which specific industries expanded, how many people were employed, and whether specific
events or policies contributed to the expansion or contraction of a particular sector. For country-specific
analyses of this type, refer to Structural Change, Fundamentals, and Growth: A Framework and Country
Studies (forthcoming), edited by McMillan, Rodrik, and Sepulveda.
3. Identification of Growth Accelerations
We use data from the Penn World Tables (PWT) 9.0 to compute annualized growth rates and to
identify growth accelerations for the Latin American and African countries included in the GGDC’s 10
sector database. Our definition of a growth acceleration is based on a slightly modified version of the
filter applied by Hausmann, Pritchett and Rodrik (2005) – heretofore HPR. Instead of examining
annualized growth in GDP per capita over an eight-year period, we limit ourselves to a seven year period
since our analysis is primarily focused on recent growth episodes. Thus, we will say that a country has
experienced a period of growth acceleration if it satisfies the following three conditions:
(3)

𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡,𝑡𝑡+𝑛𝑛 ≥ 3.5 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 –– growth is rapid;

10

(4)

(5)

∆𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡 = 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡,𝑡𝑡+𝑛𝑛 − 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡−𝑛𝑛,𝑡𝑡 ≥ 2.0 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 –– growth accelerates;

𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡+𝑛𝑛 ≥ 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚{𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 }, 𝑖𝑖 ≤ 𝑡𝑡 –– post-growth output exceeds pre-episode peak;

where the relevant time horizon is seven years (i.e., n = 6).

We summarize the timing and nature of these growth accelerations in Table 3. Column (1) of
Table 3 indicates the year in which the growth acceleration started for each country. Columns (2) and (3)
show the average annual growth rates in the pre and post acceleration periods respectively. In column
(4) we report the difference between the pre and post acceleration growth rates. In column (5) we
indicate whether post-growth output exceeds the pre-episode peak. In column (6), we report the
growth rate following the initial seven years of each growth episode. The numbers in column (6) indicate
that with the exception of Venezuela countries in Africa and Latin America have continued to grow –
mostly at a rapid pace - following the initial period of growth acceleration.
It is evident from Table 3 that most countries satisfy the three conditions in Equations (3)–(5)
but there are some exceptions. Rather than dropping countries from the analysis, we modify the filter so
as to include all Latin American and African countries in our analysis. For 8 countries – 4 in Latin America
and 4 in Africa – that do not satisfy the first condition in Equation (3) we lower the cutoff to 2.0 ppa.
Additionally, in 7 out of 20 countries the level of per capita GDP in the first year of growth acceleration
has not yet exceeded the pre-episode peak. We keep these countries and indicate the year in which this
happens in column (6) of Table 3. Finally, in the last row of Table 3 we report statistics for India because
unlike the rest of Asia, India’s growth take-off is relatively recent. Although it started to pick up speed in
1983 and it has become more rapid in the 1990s and 2000s.
To check the robustness of the results reported in Table 3, we use GDP per capita data from the
World Development Indicators (WDI) and value added per worker data from the Groningen Growth and
Development Center (GGDC). The results of this comparison are reported in Table 4. In column (1) we
repeat the initial year of the growth acceleration based on the data in Table 3. Although not reported in
Table 4, we do find that the two data sources produce identical initial years for the start of the growth
acceleration in almost all of the countries while it is off by only 1 or 2 years for a few countries. Thus our
comparisons are based on the initial year of the acceleration identified using the PWT data. In columns
(2)–(4) we report annualized growth rates in the 7 years leading up to the growth acceleration based on
PWT, WDI and GGDC and in columns (5)–(7) we report these same growth rates during the period of the

11

7-year growth acceleration. In columns (8)–(10) we report the difference in growth rates between the
pre- and post-acceleration periods based on the numbers in columns (2)–(7).
The PWT and WDI data show similar growth rates before and during the growth episodes for all
countries except Mexico. For Mexico, the WDI data show a much lower growth rate over the growth
episode identified using the PWT (1.57% versus 2.28%) and a smaller difference in growth rates pre- and
post-growth acceleration (1.04% versus 2.40%). We nevertheless keep Mexico in our sample since in the
growth decomposition analysis, the within versus between components may still be informative.
By contrast, a comparison between growth in GDP per capita and growth in value added per
worker or labor productivity growth using the (GGDC) data reveals that labor productivity growth rates
are comparable to GDP growth rates albeit slightly lower. However, Mexico and Venezuela are
exceptions. Labor productivity growth in Mexico is negative during the post-growth acceleration phase
while per capita GDP growth rate using PWT and WDI data is positive. And labor productivity growth in
Venezuela is much lower than growth in GDP per capita. Overall, however, the differences in labor
productivity growth over the two periods are comparable to those of GDP per capita growth. This is
important because when we decompose growth into its’ within and between components we use the
GGDC data.
4.

Structural Change During Growth Accelerations

A. Comparing patterns in Africa and Latin America
To better understand both the sources and sustainability of the growth accelerations we
identified in Section 3, we decompose labor productivity growth into its’ within and between
components. We use the GGDC data for this analysis and the methodology laid out in Section 2 for the
growth decomposition. We examine both the pre and post acceleration periods as defined in Table 3.
For the purpose of analyzing shifts in patterns of labor productivity growth, we extend the time horizon
on either side of the break by three years so that in essence we study the growth decomposition in the
10 years leading up to the growth acceleration and in the 10 years following the growth acceleration.
We begin with broad patterns and then dig into country specifics. Figure 5 summarizes the
growth decompositions by region and income status. We include India as a separate “region” for
purposes of comparison. Labor productivity growth is reported along the horizontal axis and ranges
from around minus 1 percent to close to 3 percent. The bars are coded according to how much of labor
12

productivity growth comes from structural change (in vertical black lines) and how much comes from
within sector labor productivity growth (in diagonal gray lines). As can be seen in Figure 5, the income
groups correspond almost exactly to the regional groupings since most of the low-income countries are
in Africa. We exclude Venezuela from this analysis because its’ growth was not sustained (see Table 3).
We also exclude Botswana and Mauritius on the grounds that they do not belong in our group of “late”
growth accelerations (see Table 3, first column).
Figure 5 shows the much higher labor productivity growth post-growth acceleration periods in
all regions and income groups and the low or negative labor productivity growth rates during pregrowth acceleration periods. This is as expected and is by design. Turning to the growth decomposition,
we can see that for Africa, both the within-sector and structural change components of labor
productivity growth are negative prior to the acceleration while labor productivity growth is close to
zero in Latin America. During the period after the growth acceleration, structural change contributes
significantly to growth in Africa but only minimally to growth in Latin America. This is not surprising since
we expect the payoff to structural change to be greatest in poor countries. India differs from both
regions in that the difference between the economywide labor productivity growth rates pre- and postacceleration is more modest and the contribution of structural change is much greater during the
relatively high growth period.
Figure 6 is a scatter plot of the relationship between within-sector labor productivity growth
(horizontal axis) and the labor productivity growth that arises as a result of structural change (vertical
axis). Country details are reported in Table A1. The most important pattern revealed by Figure 6 is the
negative correlation between within-sector labor productivity growth and the labor productivity growth
that comes from structural change. This pattern of growth is intriguing, as it contrasts with the Asian
growth experience in which within-sector productivity growth and structural change both contributed
positively – and strongly – to aggregate productivity growth during the post-growth acceleration period
(see Figure A1). In other words, recent high growth experiences in Africa and Latin America have been
based on either high productivity growth within sectors, or rapid, growth-promoting structural change,
but rarely both at the same time. We will return to this anomaly and possible explanations later in the
paper. The details of the various country experiences can also be seen in Figure 6 and fall broadly in line
with the aggregate patterns reported in Figure 5.
Figure 7 presents the relationship between within-sector labor productivity growth and
structural change in the period after the growth acceleration relative to the period leading up to the
13

growth acceleration. The relationships depicted in Figure 7 are most closely associated with the second
HPR filter for identifying growth accelerations since they tell us something about the relative importance
of the structural change and within-sector components of labor productivity growth in pushing a
country toward a growth acceleration. Once again, there is a strong negative correlation between the
within and structural change components of growth among the countries whose labor productivity
growth acceleration is modest (-0.839). But the negative relationship seems to hold only weakly among
the countries with rapid growth acceleration (-0.375), and does not hold anymore for all countries taken
together (-0.194).
Since sustained economic growth is closely associated with both an expansion of modern sector
activities and productivity growth within the non-agricultural sector, we examine each of these
contributions to economywide labor productivity growth. This helps us to gauge the relative importance
of each of these contributions to labor productivity growth in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa. We
present this growth decomposition result by region and for India in Figure 8. Labor productivity growth
rates are reported along the horizontal axis; within agricultural sector labor productivity growth is
shaded with diagonal lines, within nonagricultural sector labor productivity growth is shaded with a
chess board pattern, and the labor productivity growth coming from structural change is shaded with
vertical black lines.
Figure 8 shows that the labor productivity growth attributable to each of the within components
of growth in Africa combined is lower than within sector labor productivity growth in the nonagricultural sector alone in Latin America. For Latin America, there is no within agricultural sector
productivity growth and structural change also contributes little to economywide productivity growth. In
fact, the structural change component is negative for Latin America as a whole if we focus on
nonagriculture only. 6 The latter finding implies that labor has moved from more productive subsectors
to less productive subsectors within nonagriculture during the period of relatively high growth in Latin
America. Deindustrialization partly explains this pattern as the service sectors have expanded to absorb
the workers displaced from the manufacturing sector. India is similar to Latin America in terms of
showing strong within-sector productivity growth in the nonagricultural economy. But unlike Latin
America, structural change has also played a role in India.
Figure 8 displays only regional averages. At the level of individual countries, we may expect to
see different patterns. Indeed, Chile and Peru, the Latin American countries with the most rapid
6

The decomposition of structural change into agriculture and nonagriculture was not shown in Figure 8.

14

economywide labor productivity growth during the period of relatively high growth (4.13% and 4.03%,
respectively, see Table A1) are characterized by strong contributions from both the within
nonagricultural sector component of labor productivity growth and the structural change component.
However, for the rest of the countries in Latin America the pattern is similar to the regional average.
There is a strong negative correlation between productivity growth within the nonagricultural sector and
structural change (-0.892) across these countries; this negative correlation disappears when Chile and
Peru are added.
For some African countries, the rapid economywide productivity growth post-growth
acceleration is even higher than in Chile and Peru. For example, the economywide labor productivity
growth rate is 4.65% for Ethiopia and 4.23% for Tanzania in the period after the growth acceleration
(see Table A1). However, the negative correlation between labor productivity growth within the
nonagricultural sector and the labor productivity growth as a result of structural change remains
negative even when these two countries are included (correlation coefficient is -0.888 for all the 10
African countries and is -0.920 when Ethiopia and Tanzania are excluded).
B. Digging deeper: strong structural change with weak nonagricultural productivity growth in Africa
The within-sector and structural change components of productivity growth in African countries
are plotted in Figure 9 across multiple nonagricultural subsectors for the post-growth acceleration
period. We include the following six private nonagricultural subsectors in the figure if they have
positively contributed to aggregate labor productivity growth through structural change: manufacturing,
construction, trade services, transport services, business services and personal services. We also include
manufacturing sectors that have negatively contributed to structural change but have experienced
positive within sector labor productivity growth. We exclude mining, utilities, and government services
since these are not sectors which can be expected to contribute in a meaningful way to economywide
labor productivity growth.
The figure suggests that we can classify the countries included into two groups:
Group 1: Strong structural change with negative productivity growth in the nonagricultural
sector. The countries in this group are Ethiopia, Malawi, Senegal and Tanzania. The six
nonagricultural sectors for these four countries are shown with dots in Figure 9.
Group 2: Weak structural change. The following four countries fall into this group: Ghana, Kenya,
Nigeria and South Africa. Their sectors are represented with squares in Figure 9.
15

We observe a large negative correlation coefficient between productivity growth within sector
(x-axis) and structural change (y-axis) (-0.721) for the countries in Group 1, indicating the sectors that
positively contribute to structural change are often those that experienced declines in within-sector
labor productivity. The manufacturing sector follows a similar pattern for at least three of the countries
in this group. For the countries in Group 2, there exists a weak negative correlation between modest
structural change and within-sector labor productivity growth (with coefficient of -0.246).
Table 5 provides more details on within-sector productivity growth for nonagricultural
subsectors that contribute positively to structural change in the four Group 1 countries. While expansion
of manufacturing does contribute overall to these countries’ labor productivity growth (the structural
change term), labor productivity growth within manufacturing tends to be either negative or close to
zero.
An alternative way of looking at these patterns is to focus on correlations across countries for
individual nonagricultural subsectors. This is done in Table 6, which shows the correlation between the
structural change term and within-sector productivity growth across different countries, sector by sector.
We consider five nonagricultural sub-sectors here and Figure 10 displays the relationship in a scatter
plot. The preponderance of negative correlations is striking, especially for Group 1 countries. Once again,
sectors that contribute strongly to structural change-led growth tend to be the ones that do worse in
terms of within-sector productivity growth.
C. African versus Asian patterns of structural transformation
For purposes of comparison, we present similar information for five Asian countries during their
first 10 years after their initial growth accelerations in Figure 11. The countries covered are those
included in the GGDC dataset. In contrast to the African, Figure 9 shows that the Asian countries exhibit
a positive correlation between the within and structural change components of labor productivity
growth. In other words, in Asia well-performing nonagricultural sectors have contributed to
economywide productivity growth both by drawing labor from lower-productivity sectors and by
experiencing rapid productivity improvements.
Could these patterns be due to differences in the timing of growth accelerations? Using the
same HPR filter and data from the PWT 9.0, we identify four low-income Asian countries which
experienced growth accelerations starting in the 1990s or early 2000s; these are Bangladesh, Cambodia,
Lao and Vietnam. Since these countries are not included in the GGDC dataset, we instead use value16

added data from the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) website and employment data from the
International Labor Organization (ILO). These data allow us to decompose output and employment
among three broad sectors only: agriculture, industry and services. We note that manufacturing tends
to dominate employment and value added in these countries. A second limitation is that the ILO
provides sectoral employment data only for the 2003-2014 period. Apart from Bangladesh all of these
countries experienced their growth accelerations during the 1990s. Nevertheless, since growth
accelerated and the industrial share of employment continued to increase in the 2000s for all four
countries, we rely on 2003-2014 data to examine their post-acceleration growth patterns.
The results are shown in Figure 12. In all four countries, the within-sector component of
productivity growth was the largest contributor to overall labor productivity growth, but the structuralchange component was also positive and made a substantial contribution in at least three of the four
cases. Looking specifically at the role of the nonagricultural sectors as we did before, we find that with
almost no exception, industry and services contributed significantly to both the within and structural
change components of labor productivity growth (Figure 13).
The main conclusion we can draw from these numbers is that when structural change
contributed significantly to overall growth as it did in all four low income Asian countries, it was not at
the expense of poor productivity performance in the expanding sectors as in Africa. As we saw earlier,
this is also the case for the earlier rapidly industrializing countries such as Korea and China in Asia, but
also Mauritius in Africa.
In the next section, we develop a model that attempts to further explain the intriguing
differences between African and Asian countries in the aftermath of growth accelerations. Here we
simply note that the Asian comparison does raise concerns about the sustainability of the recent African
growth experience. While structural change is strong and has led to rapid productivity growth in African
countries, it has been accompanied by weak to negative performance in within sector productivity
growth in the non-agricultural sectors of the economy. 7 If this trend were to continue, the gap in labor
productivity between high productivity nonagricultural sectors and the agricultural sector would shrink
prematurely. i.e., while these countries still remain relatively poor. This would in turn lead to a decline in
overall growth potential and limit the role of growth-inducing structural change in the future.
7

Timmer et al. (2015) have pointed earlier that sectors that expanded their employment shares tended to have
productivity growth rates below those of shrinking sectors over the 1990-2010 period. The same point is also made
in starker form in the African context in de Vries et al. (2015).

5. A Simple Economic Framework
In this section we develop a simple economic model to help us interpret the pattern of
correlations we discussed previously. Our focus is on understanding the relationship between various
types of demand and supply side shocks, on the one hand, and patterns of structural change and withinsector labor productivity performance, on the other. In particular, what might explain the difference
between the Asian pattern and the more recent African pattern? In the former, high productivity sectors
that expanded also experienced high rates of productivity growth, whereas in the latter expanding highproductivity sectors have experienced poor productivity growth.
We will stress that this and other related asymmetries are likely the result of differences in the
nature of the shocks driving growth in the two regions. In Asia, it was the expansion of modern sectors
(especially manufacturing) that acted as the engine of growth. In the more recent growth accelerations
in Africa, the impetus came not from manufacturing or the modern parts of the economy, but from
positive demand shocks or productivity growth in agriculture.
We divide the economy into traditional and modern sectors, identified by subscripts t and m. In
terms of the classification we used before, agriculture is the main traditional sector, while urban services
and manufacturing comprise the modern sector.
Production functions in the two sectors are written as
𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡 = 𝜃𝜃𝑡𝑡 𝑔𝑔(1 − 𝑙𝑙𝑚𝑚 )
𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚 = 𝜃𝜃𝑚𝑚 𝑓𝑓(𝑙𝑙𝑚𝑚 )

where 𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡 and 𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚 are the outputs of the two sectors, 𝑙𝑙𝑚𝑚 is the share of the economy’s employment in

the modern sectors, and 𝑓𝑓(. ) and 𝑔𝑔(. ) are neoclassical production functions with 𝑓𝑓 ′ , 𝑔𝑔′ > 0 and

𝑓𝑓 ′′ , 𝑔𝑔′′ < 0. The parameters 𝜃𝜃𝑚𝑚 and 𝜃𝜃𝑡𝑡 are shifters that will allow us to do comparative statics for

supply-side shocks in different parts of the economy. Denoting the relative price of modern goods by 𝑝𝑝,

aggregate output (GDP) is

𝑦𝑦 = 𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡 + 𝑝𝑝𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚 .

We allow total expenditures in the economy to differ from GDP so that we can perform
comparative statics also around demand-side shifts. We express total expenditures, 𝑧𝑧, as the sum of
GDP and an external transfer, 𝑏𝑏.

18

𝑧𝑧 = 𝑦𝑦 + 𝑏𝑏.

On the side of consumer preferences, we posit a Stone-Geary type utility function so that
demand patterns will be non-homothetic between traditional and modern goods. In addition, we
assume demand for the modern good is price elastic. If 𝜎𝜎𝑡𝑡 is the “subsistence” level of the traditional

good, expenditures on the modern good is expressed as:

𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚 = 𝛾𝛾(𝑝𝑝)(𝑧𝑧 − 𝜎𝜎𝑡𝑡 ),

where 𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚 is the physical consumption level of the modern good and 𝛾𝛾 ′ (𝑝𝑝) < 0. Note that the budget
share of the modern good increases with total expenditures 𝑧𝑧, since

𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚
𝑧𝑧

𝜎𝜎

= 𝛾𝛾(𝑝𝑝) �1 − 𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡 �. In the limit,

when 𝑧𝑧 becomes very large relative to the subsistence consumption 𝜎𝜎𝑡𝑡 , the budget share of the modern

good converges from below to 𝛾𝛾(𝑝𝑝). And since 𝛾𝛾 ′ (𝑝𝑝) < 0, this budget share is also decreasing in the
relative price of the modern sector. Demand for the goods produced by the traditional sector is
correspondingly written as
𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 = 𝜎𝜎𝑡𝑡 + (1 − 𝛾𝛾(𝑝𝑝))(𝑧𝑧 − 𝜎𝜎𝑡𝑡 ).

Note that the budget constraint 𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 + 𝑝𝑝𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚 = 𝑧𝑧 is satisfied.

We need to express market-clearing for at least one of the sectors, which we do for the modern

one:
𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚 = 𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚 + 𝜌𝜌(𝑏𝑏)

where 𝜌𝜌(𝑏𝑏) is the component of the external transfer that comes in the form of the modern good.

Labor is mobile between the two sectors, but we state labor market equilibrium in a manner

that allows for structural misallocation in the economy. In particular, we assume there is a wedge of
magnitude 𝜑𝜑 > 0 that prevents the equalization of the value marginal products of labor in the two
sectors. So:

𝑝𝑝𝜃𝜃𝑚𝑚 𝑓𝑓 ′ (𝑙𝑙𝑚𝑚 ) = 𝜃𝜃𝑡𝑡 𝑔𝑔′ (1 − 𝑙𝑙𝑚𝑚 ) + 𝜑𝜑.

Since the value of the marginal product of labor is higher in the modern sector than in the traditional
sector in equilibrium, the economy has too few workers in the modern sector. Structural change in the
direction of the modern sector – a movement of workers from the traditional to modern sector – would
increase economywide labor productivity.
19

This completes the description of the formal model. We have a system of eight independent
equations that determines the following eight endogenous variables: 𝑝𝑝, 𝑙𝑙𝑚𝑚 , 𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚 , 𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 , 𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚 , 𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡 , 𝑦𝑦 and 𝑧𝑧. We
will use this system to perform comparative statics on both demand-side (𝑏𝑏) and supply-side shocks

(𝜃𝜃𝑚𝑚 , 𝜃𝜃𝑡𝑡 ).

The equilibrium of the model can be pictured with the help of Figure 14. The horizontal axis

represents the size of the labor force, with the two vertices as the origins of the modern and traditional
sectors, respectively. The vertical axes measure the value marginal product of labor in the modern (left
axis) and traditional (right axis) sectors (𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑚𝑚 and 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡 ). The downward sloping schedules, from

the perspective of each origin, capture the declining physical marginal product of labor as employment
increases, holding all else constant. The equilibrium allocation of labor is determined such that 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑚𝑚

exceeds 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡 exactly by 𝜑𝜑, the wedge between productivity in the two sectors. Note that the 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑚𝑚

schedule is drawn for the equilibrium value of the relative price p, which is determined with the addition
of the demand-side of the system.
We begin by analyzing supply side shocks, setting 𝑏𝑏 = 0. Consider first a positive supply shock to

the modern sector that leads the sector to expand on impact. In terms of the model, this corresponds to
an increase in 𝜃𝜃𝑚𝑚 . This shifts the 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑚𝑚 schedule up, as shown in Figure 15. However, this cannot be

the end of the story, since the increase in income that is generated in the modern sector has

implications for relative prices. On impact, the supply shock raises the supply of modern goods, while
leaving the supply of traditional goods unchanged. The resulting income gains will show up as increases
in demand for both goods. Consequently, the impact effect of the shock is to create an excess supply of
the modern good (and an excess demand for the traditional good). The relative price of the modern
good (𝑝𝑝) will therefore have to decline.
The magnitude of the decline depends on preferences. Given our assumption of price elastic
demand for the modern good, the decline in 𝑝𝑝 has to be smaller in proportional terms than the increase
in 𝜃𝜃𝑚𝑚 . To see why, assume, counterfactually, that the decline was proportionally identical, so that the

𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑚𝑚 schedule returned to its original, pre-shock position (i.e., that

𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
𝑝𝑝

=−

𝑑𝑑𝜃𝜃𝑚𝑚
).
𝜃𝜃𝑚𝑚

Since the fall in 𝑝𝑝

exactly offsets the rise in 𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚 , there would be no income effect on the composition of expenditures

(recall that 𝑧𝑧 = 𝑦𝑦 = 𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡 + 𝑝𝑝𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚 ). However, there would still be an excess demand for the modern good,

because price elastic demand implies that the quantity demanded would have risen more than the

20

𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑

𝑑𝑑𝜃𝜃

supply. Hence to reinstate goods-market equilibrium 𝑝𝑝 must fall by less (so that � � < � 𝜃𝜃 𝑚𝑚 �).
𝑝𝑝
𝑚𝑚

Consequently, the 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑚𝑚 schedule shifts only partway back in the final equilibrium (see Figure 15). 8

The result is that the positive supply shock to the modern sector ends up increasing both labor

productivity (𝜃𝜃𝑚𝑚 𝑓𝑓′(𝑙𝑙𝑚𝑚 )) and employment (𝑙𝑙𝑚𝑚 ) in the modern sector (Figure 15). Note further that any

increase in total expenditures 𝑧𝑧 due to the positive productivity shock would reinforce this outcome, as

it would lead to greater demand at the margin for the modern sector, and hence expanded employment
there. As we discussed in the previous section, this is the canonical East Asian pattern of structural
change during the process of economic development.
Next, consider a positive productivity shock in the traditional sector (𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡 >0). This shifts the

𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡 schedule up (Figure 16). Once again, there will be a relative price adjustment. The excess supply
of the traditional good will drive up the relative price of the modern sector, p. As regards the direction
of change in the equilibrium allocation of labor, what matters is whether the rise in p is proportionally
larger or smaller than the increase in 𝜃𝜃𝑡𝑡 . Our assumptions on preferences pull in conflicting directions in

this case. The income effect produces a desired increase in the budget share of the modern good, which
requires a proportionately larger increase in p. But the fact that the budget share of the modern good is
decreasing in p pushes in the opposite direction. We assume here that the income effect dominates (as
in Matsuyama 1992), so that

𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
𝑝𝑝

>

𝑑𝑑𝜃𝜃𝑡𝑡
.
𝜃𝜃𝑡𝑡

In terms of our figure, this means there will be a commensurately greater upwards shift in the
𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑚𝑚 schedule relative to the 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑡𝑡 schedule. The result, as shown in Figure 16., is once again an

increase in employment in the modern sector, 𝑙𝑙𝑚𝑚 . However, in this case expansion of the modern sector
is accompanied by a decline in labor productivity in the modern sector (𝜃𝜃𝑚𝑚 𝑓𝑓′(𝑙𝑙𝑚𝑚 )), because of the

declining marginal productivity of labor (and the absence of any increase in 𝜃𝜃𝑚𝑚 ). This outcome is

reminiscent of the African model of structural change we discussed previously.

There is reason to believe that developments in African agriculture in particular have been
important in driving economic growth there. A large part of total employment (60-80%) in low-income
African counties remains in the agricultural sector. Even modest growth in agriculture can have a
8

The general case, but with homothetic preferences is derived in a similar model in Dani Rodrik (2016). For the
case of non-homothetic preferences, see Kiminori Matsuyama (1992). However, Matsuyama assumes the price
elasticity of demand for manufacturing is unity, which implies that an increase in manufacturing productivity
leaves manufacturing employment unchanged. Our assumption of price elastic demand for the modern good
produces a different result, as explained in the text,

21

significant demand effect in domestic markets for nonagricultural goods and services. Among the lowincome African countries in the GGDC dataset, total within sector labor productivity growth is mainly
explained by agricultural productivity growth in 6 of the 8 countries, and agricultural productivity growth
is important in three of the four countries in Group 1 (ETH, TZA and MWI). When income increases
among the rural population and it is spent disproportionally on nonagricultural products, this creates a
market for small businesses in the informal economy, including micro and small manufacturing firms
that can provide import substitutes but at much lower prices (and often with lower quality). Such
informal manufacturing operations often have low labor productivity. This explains why modern-sector
labor productivity (including in manufacturing) falls with structural change.
Finally, we consider a positive demand-side shock to the economy, in the form an external
transfer 𝑏𝑏. The relative-price implications of this would depend on the specific composition of the

transfer in terms of the modern and traditional goods. We consider a neutral “aggregate demand” shock
such that the transfer expands the supply of the two goods available to domestic consumers in equal
proportions. Therefore, at the initial relative prices the expenditure shares of the two goods remain
unchanged.
However, since consumers are now richer, their desired budget share of the modern good
increases. This implies that the relative price of the modern sector p must rise. This shifts the 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑚𝑚
schedule up and induces an increase in modern-sector employment. The equilibrium is as shown in

Figure 17. In the new equilibrium, labor productivity in the modern sector falls as employment expands.
This demand-driven pattern of structural change is also in line with the African model.
The shocks that generate Asian versus African patterns of structural change have differing
implications for relative prices as well, as sketched out above. A positive supply-side shock in the
modern sector reduces the relative price of the modern sector, while a positive aggregate demand
shock or a productivity shock in the traditional sector raises it. When structural change is driven from
the demand-side or by productivity increase in the traditional sector, expanding modern sectors will also
experience a rise in their relative prices. As Table 7 shows, this is broadly consistent with the African
experience for countries in Group 1 – those that experienced strong structural change with declining
within-sector labor productivity in modern sectors.
We also compare the domestic relative prices of manufacturing (the archetypal modern sector)
in the Asian and African countries during their high-growth periods. As Figure 18 shows, manufacturing
22

prices in Asia exhibit a very sharp drop relative to economywide prices, especially during the highgrowth years of the 1960s and 1970s. The decline is by a factor of 2-4 over a period of three decades. In
Africa, by contrast, there is either a much smaller decline, or no downward trend at all (Figure 19).
During the growth acceleration years, African countries exhibit no fall in manufacturing relative prices.
This is consistent with the expansion in African manufacturing (such as it is) being driven mostly by the
demand effects of developments originating elsewhere in the economy.
6. Concluding Remarks: The Sustainability of Recent Growth Accelerations
A large number of countries in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa have experienced growth
accelerations beginning in the early 1990s, making the most recent couple of decades a rare period of
economic convergence with advanced economies. Yet we know from the history of growth spurts in the
developing world that many growth accelerations eventually peter out (Pritchett, Hausmann and Rodrik
2005; Jones and Olken 2008). The present sample includes four countries where, after the initial
acceleration, annual labor productivity growth fell below 1 percent (Mexico, Malawi, Senegal and South
Africa) and one country where it turned negative (Venezuela). By contrast, growth accelerated early and
lasted for three to four decades in Botswana, Ghana, India, and Mauritius (see Table 3). The latter
countries’ longer term growth patterns could help us better understand the potential paths of other
countries in Africa and Latin America.
We present in Figure 20 the long term growth patterns in each decade following these four
countries’ growth take-offs. Their growth accelerations were triggered by different mechanisms:
diamond discoveries in Botswana in the mid-1960s; the creation of an export processing zone and the
emergence of a labor-intensive manufacturing sector in Mauritius during the early 1970s; and businessand market-friendly reforms that unleashed private sector investment in Ghana and India during the
1980s. Because of these different initial triggers, we are likely to find different patterns of growth across
these four countries.
We summarize the salient features of each country’s experience in Table 8 paying particular
attention to the roles of within-sector labor productivity growth and structural change. One thing that
Table 8 makes clear is the importance of robust within sector productivity growth. In all four countries,
within sector labor productivity growth makes a positive contribution to labor productivity growth in the
early years and becomes increasingly important as time goes on. By contrast, structural change plays an
important role in the early years and becomes less important over time. This is as expected: we pointed
23

out in section 2 the diminishing importance of inter-sectoral labor reallocation over the course of
development, as structural productivity gaps diminish.
In addition, we can see from Table 8 that the manufacturing sector has not always contributed a
significant growth impetus. Mauritius followed the East Asian path and industrialization figured
prominently in economywide labor productivity growth, especially during the first two decades when
structural change also played an important role. The share of manufacturing employment peaked at
more than 30 percent of total employment in the late 1980s. Botswana, on the other hand, never
established a sizable manufacturing sector. In Ghana, manufacturing contributed to within-sector labor
productivity growth and exhibited modest increases in employment in the early years of the country’s
growth acceleration. But in subsequent periods manufacturing’s employment share has remained
stagnant. Ghana’s labor productivity growth has been balanced across sectors making it difficult to
identify a leading sector.
As in Ghana, the share of manufacturing employment in India has stagnated at around 12
percent. Manufacturing did contribute to labor productivity growth through structural change, although
within-sector labor productivity growth has been the main driver of growth in India. Over a period of
nearly thirty years, India’s manufacturing employment share increased by a mere 2 percentage points.
Overall labor productivity growth in India was modest during the first decade of the growth acceleration,
but it accelerated in the following decades. Meanwhile, agriculture’s share of employment fell by 16
percentage points, as employment in service sectors grew. In terms of broad patterns of structural
change, Ghana and India are quite similar, although India has experienced much higher within-sector
labor productivity growth in recent years.
The growth experiences that raise the greatest concern with respect to sustainability are those
that exhibit stagnant or declining within-sector labor productivity in the modern sectors, as in many of
our African cases. As the experience with sustained growth we have just summarized indicates,
productivity growth in the modern sectors is the sine qua non of longer-term development.
This is not to belittle the significance of rapid productivity growth in agriculture, the archetypal
traditional sector. Our model suggests agriculture has played a key role in Africa not only on its own
account, but also as a driver of growth-increasing structural change. Diversification into non-traditional
products and adoption of new production techniques can transform agriculture into a modern activity in
part. But there are limits to how far this process can carry the economy. In part because of the low
24

income elasticity of demand for agricultural products, a movement of labor out of agriculture is an
inevitable outcome during the process of development. The labor that is released has to be absorbed in
modern activities. And if productivity is not growing in these modern sectors, economywide growth
ultimately will stall. This is so on account of both the within and structural-change components. The
contribution that the structural-change component can make is necessarily self-limiting if the modern
sector does not experience rapid productivity growth on its own.
It is possible of course that the increase in demand for modern-sector goods would lead to
capital accumulation and technology adoption in modern services, setting off a process of productivity
growth. Perhaps this will eventually happen in Africa. But it does not show up in the data so far.
None of this is to suggest that low-income African countries cannot sustain moderate rates of
productivity growth, on the back of steady improvements in human capital and governance. In view of
the prospects for advanced economies, continued convergence seems quite achievable. But the recent
exceptional growth rates engineered with the help of rapid growth-promoting structural change may
well be out of reach.

Appendix
Methodological Notes on Growth Decompositions
Equation (2) in Section 2 indicates that the growth decomposition is an accounting exercise
which can have various economic interpretations. Besides Equation (2), there are a few different ways
to decompose economywide labor productivity. In general, we are facing three sets of choices: (a) which
weights to use, (b) whether to use annual data or simply period end points, and (c) how to annualize the
growth rates. While aggregate labor productivity growth rates are little affected by these choices, they
could influence the magnitude of labor productivity growth rates within sector and from structural
change. The difference in results among the three choices disappears only in the limit where the length
of a period is infinitely short.
The following discussion explains how different choices could possibly affect the magnitude of
growth in both the within and between components of the growth decomposition. A few examples
based on the GGDC data are also provided. We then explain our preferred methodology for
decomposing labor productivity growth into its’ within and between components.
Equation (A1) below is a starting point that describes a change in economywide labor
productivity in a given period of (t-k, t) with k years:
(A1)

𝑦𝑦 𝑡𝑡 − 𝑦𝑦 𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 = ∆𝑦𝑦 𝑡𝑡 = ∑𝑖𝑖 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 − ∑𝑖𝑖 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘

where 𝑦𝑦 𝑡𝑡 and 𝑦𝑦 𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 are economywide labor productivity at time t and t-k respectively, 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 and 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 are
𝐿𝐿𝑡𝑡

𝐿𝐿𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘

𝑖𝑖
are share of labor (L) employed in
sector i’s labor productivity at t and t-k, 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 = 𝐿𝐿𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 and 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 = 𝐿𝐿𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘

sector i at t and t-k, and 𝑡𝑡 > 𝑘𝑘.

By rearranging (A1), we can express the growth decomposition as

(A2)

∆𝑦𝑦 𝑡𝑡 = ∑𝑖𝑖 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 ∆𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 + ∑𝑖𝑖 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 ∆𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡

(A3)

∆𝑦𝑦 𝑡𝑡 = ∑𝑖𝑖 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 ∆𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 + ∑𝑖𝑖 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 ∆𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡

or

where ∆𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 = 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 − 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 and ∆𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 = 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 − 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 . (A2) is identical to equation (2) in Section 2, and is the
version of the decomposition most commonly used in the literature (as in McMillan and Rodrik, 2011,
and de Vries, Timmer and de Vries, 2015).
In (A2), weights in the “within term” are sectors’ labor shares at the beginning of the period
(start-point weight) and weights in the “between term” are sectors’ labor productivity at the end of the
period (end-point weight). In (A3), weights are the opposite of those in (A3), i.e., the within term uses
end-point weights and the between term uses start-point weights. Both ∆𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 and ∆𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 can be positive or
negative for a given sector, while ∑ ∆𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 = 0.
Assuming ∆𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 ≠ 0 and ∆𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 ≠ 0, for a given sector i, there are four possibilities for combined
and ∆𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 with different signs, i.e., (a) ∆𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 > 0 & ∆𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 < 0, (b) ∆𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 > 0 & ∆𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 > 0, (c) ∆𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 < 0 &
> 0, and (d) ∆𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 < 0 & ∆𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 < 0. Under different situations, the choice of the weights affects the
magnitudes of the two components at the sector level. We consider each case below.

∆𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡
∆𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡

55

Case (a):
countries.

𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 > 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 and 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 < 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 . This is commonly seen for i = agriculture among developing

In this case, sector i positively contributes to within sector growth and negatively contributes to growth
from structural change. Moreover, since 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 ∆𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 > 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 ∆𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 and �𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 ∆𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 � > �𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 ∆𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 �, compared to eq.
(A3), eq. (A2) could overstate the contribution of sector i’s (agricultural) within sector productivity
growth and hence also overstate the negative contribution of this sector to structural change.
Case (b):
𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 > 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 and 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 > 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 . This is commonly seen among East Asian countries for i =
manufacturing.

In this case, 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 ∆𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 < 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 ∆𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 and 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 ∆𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 > 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 ∆𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 . Compared to eq. (A3), eq. (A2) could understate
the contribution of sector i’s (manufacturing) within sector productivity growth and overstate the
contribution of this sector to structural change.
Case (c):
𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 < 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 and 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 > 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 . We have seen this in this paper in the case of African
countries for many nonagricultural sectors.

In this case, ∆𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 < 0, �𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 ∆𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 � < �𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 ∆𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 �, but 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 ∆𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 < 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 ∆𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 , which implies that eq. (A2) could
understate both the negative contribution of sector i to within-sector productivity changes and its
positive contribution from structural change in comparison with eq. (A3).
Case (d):
𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 < 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 and 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 < 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 , which is a rare case, but we do see it in Hong Kong for the
construction sector for the period 1990-2010 in the GGDC data.

Because both ∆𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 < 0 and ∆𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 < 0, �𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 ∆𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 � > �𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 ∆𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 � and �𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 ∆𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 � < �𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 ∆𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 �, eq. (A2) could
overstate sector i’s negative contribution within-sector and understate the negative contribution to
structural change in comparison with eq. (A3).

The discussion of these four cases are for individual sectors. There is never a situation where all
sectors of a country follow a single case, and thus, combined effects across sectors often produce
ambiguity. In general, there is less concern for which equation should be used when productivity gaps
across sectors are small or changes in employment structure over time are modest. In the examples
shown in Figure A2, however, it is clear that the choice between these two equations affects the
decomposition in the African and Latin American country groups significantly, while there is little effect
for the high income country group or for Asian countries.
We have checked the robustness of the main findings discussed in the body of the paper by
comparing them with the results when we use eq. (A3) instead of eq. (A2). As expected, we get a
somewhat different quantitative decomposition into the between and within terms. But we still have a
negative correlation between the magnitudes of the within and between terms. In addition, Latin
America’s growth acceleration is due overwhelmingly to the improvement in the within terms, while
Africa’s is due to the between terms, as discussed.
The second and third choices related to the growth decomposition exercise are whether we just
calculate changes in labor productivity growth within sector and from structural change in a given period
(e.g., over 10 years) as shown in eqs. (A2) or (A3), or whether we compute their annual growth rates.
Reporting annual growth rates in labor productivity growth within sector and from structural change has
56

the advantage that we can relate these to annual growth rates in GDP as we do in Table 4 of this paper.
A commonly used method is to first get the changes in within and between terms across sectors over an
entire period, and then annualize them to get an average annual growth rate. This method is used by
McMillan and Rodrik (2011) and de Vries, Timmer and de Vries (2015). One advantage of this method is
that we only need value-added and employment data across sectors at two data points (two years). The
disadvantage is that when time series data are available, this method simply ignores all the data
between the initial and end points in a growth decomposition analysis. Again, when sectoral labor
productivity and shares of employment do not fluctuate over time and follow a monotonic trend in
growth (a trend either up or down) during the period in question, different methods of annualizing
matter little. Indeed, we do not see much difference for the two different methods of annualizing the
data for the high income and Asian country groups, but there are some differences for African countries
(Figure A3).
In this paper, we focus on recent growth accelerations in African and Latin American countries.
Therefore, we decided to use a year-by-year calculation using the weights defined in eq. (A2) but to
calculate each year’s growth rate for the within and between components at sector level across
countries as follows:
(A4)

𝑔𝑔𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡 = ∑𝑖𝑖 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−1 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−1 𝑔𝑔𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡 𝑖𝑖 + ∑𝑖𝑖 ∆𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡−1 (1 + 𝑔𝑔𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡 𝑖𝑖 ).
∆𝑦𝑦 𝑡𝑡

∆𝑦𝑦 𝑡𝑡

𝑦𝑦 𝑡𝑡

𝑖𝑖
where 𝑔𝑔𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡 = 𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡−1 , 𝑔𝑔𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡 𝑖𝑖 = 𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡−1
, and 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 is relative labor productivity for sector i defined as 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 = 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 . We
𝑖𝑖

then calculate the average annual growth rates for the within and between terms in a given period (e.g.,
over 10 years) for each sector by taking a simple average as follows:

and

where 𝑔𝑔̅𝑖𝑖𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝑔𝑔̅𝑖𝑖𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 are the average labor productivity growth rates of sector i within sector and
from structural change in a given 10-year period, and where both 𝑔𝑔̅𝑖𝑖𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝑔𝑔̅𝑖𝑖𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 are measured as
fractions of the average annual growth rate of economywide labor productivity in this period. Thus, the
annual economywide labor productivity growth rate and its two components in this given period are
defined as follows:
(A5)

𝑔𝑔̅ = ∑𝑖𝑖 𝑔𝑔̅𝑖𝑖𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + ∑𝑖𝑖 𝑔𝑔̅𝑖𝑖𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏

Table A1 below presents 𝑔𝑔̅ , ∑𝑖𝑖 𝑔𝑔̅𝑖𝑖𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , and ∑𝑖𝑖 𝑔𝑔̅𝑖𝑖𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 at the country level, while the details for
