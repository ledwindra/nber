Vehicle Scrappage and Gasoline Policy
Mark R. Jacobsen and Arthur A. van Benthem
NBER Working Paper No. 19055
May 2013
JEL No. H23,Q52,Q58
ABSTRACT
We estimate the sensitivity of scrap decisions to changes in used car values – the "scrap elasticity"
– and show how it influences used car fleets under policies aimed at reducing gasoline use. Large
scrap elasticities will tend to produce emissions leakage under efficiency standards as the longevity
of used vehicles is increased, a process known as the Gruenspecht effect. To explore the magnitude
of this leakage we assemble a novel dataset of U.S. used vehicle registrations and prices, which we
relate through time via differential effects in gasoline cost: A gasoline price increase or decrease of
$1 alters the number of fuel-efficient vs. fuel-inefficient vehicles scrapped by 18%. These relationships
allow us to provide what we believe are the first estimates of the scrap elasticity itself, which we find
to be about -0.7. When applied in a model of fuel economy standards, the elasticities we estimate
suggest that 13-23% of the expected fuel savings will leak away through the used vehicle market.
This considerably reduces the cost-effectiveness of the standard, rivaling or exceeding the importance
of the often-cited mileage "rebound" effect.

1. Introduction
Passenger vehicles currently enjoy long lifetimes and are traded on an extensive
used market. We examine the timing of decisions to scrap used cars and the relation
between changes in scrap rates, the gasoline price, and used car resale value. The extent
to which the fuel economy of used cars is elastic – via differential rates of scrap as used
car prices change across the fleet – has important consequences for policies meant to
reduce gasoline use. Despite this, there has been surprisingly little empirical guidance on
the relevant elasticity of used vehicle scrap rates.
We address three questions: First, what is the effect of gasoline price changes on
scrap rates? Second, what is the elasticity of the scrap rate with respect to used vehicle
prices? And third, how does this scrap elasticity interact with fuel economy policies
aimed to reduce emissions from new vehicles?
We begin by developing a novel dataset that includes a detailed history of used
vehicle prices and registrations at the make, model, and trim level. We use it to estimate
the responsiveness of used vehicle prices and scrap rates to changes in the gasoline price,
addressing the first question above. Higher retail gasoline prices mean fuel-efficient cars
are scrapped less while the largest, thirstiest cars are scrapped more. Also, the resale
value of fuel-efficient cars rises relative to fuel-inefficient cars. We use this relationship
as the first stage of an instrumental variables estimation of the scrap elasticity with
respect to used vehicle prices. We provide estimates of the magnitude of this elasticity
using a combination of cross-sectional and time series variation. This variation is caused
by differential impacts of gasoline price changes on models of different fuel-economies
as well as the impact of gasoline price changes on the fuel cost of the same vintage of a
2

particular make-model over time. These changes in the used fleet are part of the
mechanism through which changes in gasoline demand are realized when a tax is applied.
We next model the more complex interaction of the scrap elasticity with fuel
economy policy. Early work by Gruenspecht (1982) highlights the relevance of the
vehicle-scrap margin in this context: When new vehicle prices rise due to tightened fuel
economy regulation, the prices of used vehicles also increase in equilibrium. This gives
used vehicle owners an incentive to postpone the decision to scrap their vehicles, leading
to a larger and potentially less fuel-efficient used vehicle fleet. Goulder et al (2012)
briefly explore the magnitude of this “used car leakage” effect and find that, depending
on the scrap elasticity, it can substantially reduce the effectiveness of fuel economy
standards.
The magnitude of the effect is tied directly to the scrap elasticity, which we
estimate to be around -0.7. The detail in our data allows us to further decompose this
elasticity according to attributes like age and class of vehicle. Our estimates suggest
important differences between classes, with 10-19 year-old pickup trucks and sedans
having lower scrap elasticities while SUVs and vans tend to be more elastic.
Our work follows a series of recent papers examining the effects of gasoline
prices on the used car market, a relation we will take advantage of in the first stage of our
instrumental variables approach: Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer (2013), Sallee, West,
and Fan (2010), and Allcott and Wozny (2012) all consider the nexus between gasoline
price changes and changes in used vehicle prices. Precise accounting of the fuel
economies and lifespans of used cars allows these authors to recover novel estimates of
consumer response to gasoline costs. Li, Timmins, and von Haefen (2009) and Knittel

3

and Sandler (2013) examine the response of new and used car fuel economies to changes
in the gasoline price, including estimates of the relation between scrap rates and gasoline
price.
In contrast, we work to isolate the influence of the used vehicle price itself on
scrap, allowing us to investigate the Gruenspecht effect in the context of fuel economy
standards. Using a simulation model of the U.S. vehicle fleet, the elasticities we estimate
suggest that 13-23% of the expected fuel savings will leak away through the used vehicle
market. This effect is often ignored by policy makers, yet it rivals or exceeds the
importance of the often-cited mileage “rebound” effect.
The elasticities we present here could further be applied to consider the influence
of a number of other programs, for example vehicle subsidies that target particular
classes, or incentives like scrap bonuses that alter prices and scrap rates in the used
market directly.
To our knowledge the only prior empirical work looking at the relation between
used vehicle values and the scrap rate consists of two case studies based on policy shocks
(Alberini et al (1998) and Hahn (1995)). The data from these studies is insufficient to
construct price-scrap response curves over a meaningful range and they are confined to
small geographic regions. In contrast, our data span the U.S. and cover the 17 years
between 1993 and 2009. The detailed cross-sectional variation we have available also
allows us to examine differences in scrap responsiveness across vehicle age, class,
manufacturer, and fuel economy rating.

4

Programs like “cash-for-clunkers”, where new car purchasers receive a subsidy to
have their previous vehicle destroyed, are also related to our question.1 Such policies by
definition influence people considering a new car purchase, who may be very different
from the typical final owners of vehicles. These last owners of cars often repair or
maintain the vehicle personally, and may operate them on a salvage title long after the
typical car consumer would no longer be interested. We are able to capture the decisions
of both groups, examining the entire used fleet using data on vehicle registrations.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the dataset we
assemble. Section 3 explores the relation between gasoline prices, used vehicle prices,
and scrap rates, with Section 4 offering an alternative specification. Section 5 uses these
relationships to provide instrumented estimates of the vehicle scrap elasticity itself.
Finally Section 6 provides an application of our elasticity estimates, simulating the
influence of the scrap elasticity on fuel savings achieved via U.S. fuel economy
standards.

2. Data
We have assembled a panel of data on used vehicles from two industry sources:
The R.L. Polk company maintains a database of vehicle registrations in the U.S. by
individual vehicle identification number (VIN). The National Automobile Dealer's

1

Other papers have investigated the effectiveness of the Car Allowance Rebate System (“cash for
clunkers”) program along several dimensions. Busse et al (2012) find that the program increased consumer
welfare and that the scrappage of the old vehicles did not affect prices in the used vehicle market. Mian
and Sufi (2012) provide evidence that cash for clunkers affected the timing of new vehicle purchases, but
did not lead to additional purchases. They find no evidence that the program was effective as a fiscal
stimulus policy: cash for clunkers had no impact on employment, house prices or default rates in cities with
higher exposure.

Association (NADA) combines auction and sale records to produce monthly used vehicle
valuations at the sub-model level.
Due to the potential for lag in the registration data (available as often as quarterly)
we work only with annual variation. The coarseness of the time series is counterbalanced
by very fine cross-sectional variation, where we can measure prices and registrations for
each 10-digit VIN prefix separately. This allows us to distinguish not only vehicle
models, but also engine, body style (e.g. 4-door or 2-door), and certain optional features
(e.g., horsepower, weight, MSRP) in each observation. Data is aggregate at the level of
the U.S. (we assume the used car market is liquid across states).
We merge fuel economies, options, and characteristics for each vehicle by VIN
prefix. The NADA data provides a crosswalk from the VIN prefix to model, body-style,
and “trim” (e.g. “LX”, “DX”, etc.) as well as data on some car characteristics. From
there we match the car description to EPA fuel economy ratings back to 1978.
The most complete and consistently coded data span the period 1999 - 2009 and
we currently focus our analysis on this period.2 In each year we consider vehicles
between 1 and 19 years old, measuring the fraction scrapped as the change in
registrations from the previous year. Our measure of scrap rate is therefore most
precisely described as a change in size of the legally operated U.S. fleet; we do not
distinguish exported or unregistered vehicles from those that are scrapped.3 Equation
(3.3) below makes precise our translation from registration counts to scrap rates.

2

Note that this period applies to the registration data. Vehicle vintage goes back much further. For
example, we have observations up to 19-year-old vehicles in 1999. The limiting factor is used vehicle
prices, which are available back to model-year 1980.
3
To the extent that accounting for used vehicle exports is significant (see Davis and Kahn, 2010) we can
integrate explicit data on exports from Ward’s Automotive Fact Books.

Table 1 displays a summary of vehicle scrap rates and prices through age 19.
Vehicles that are 20 and older represent only 1.6% of the registered fleet and we drop
them due to difficulty obtaining data for the oldest vintages. Overall, we see that vehicle
scrap rates increase gradually with age from 1.6% (for 2-year-old vehicles) to 14.4% (for
19-year-old vehicles). Pickup trucks and SUVs have higher scrap rates when relatively
new (corresponding to higher accident frequency) and lower scrap rates at older ages.
There is also considerable heterogeneity among manufacturers: Figure 1 displays
scrap profiles by age for a selection of vehicle brands. Scrap rates are relatively similar
over the first few years with considerable heterogeneity emerging at older ages. Luxury
brands tend to have the lowest scrap rates as they age.
Figure 2 displays scrap rates after dividing all vehicles into quartiles by fuel
economy. The heterogeneity in this dimension is particularly interesting for policy: As
vehicles age the more fuel-efficient vehicles are scrapped faster. Like differences across
brands, heterogeneity in scrap rates appears most strongly in the second decade of the
vehicle’s life. For the oldest vehicles, scrap rates are nearly twice as high in the most
fuel-efficient cars.

3. Equilibrium Effects of Gasoline Price Changes
We begin with a description of the relation between gasoline prices and valuation
of used vehicles, key to the first stage of our scrap elasticity estimates appearing below.
Following Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer (2013) we first divide vehicles according to
fuel economy quartiles and examine the response to gasoline price changes.

7

We focus on the relative effect between different quartiles in order to allow
flexible controls for time and vehicle age. Macroeconomic indicators that co-vary with
gasoline prices, for example, could increase or decrease the attractiveness of used cars in
general. This is something we are able to take out by focusing exclusively on
composition: Higher gas prices increase the value of gas sippers and decrease the value of
gas guzzlers. Conversely, this implies that higher gas prices lead to increased scrappage
of gas guzzlers and reduced scrappage of gas sippers. The fuel economy of the used fleet
is therefore not fixed, but has an elasticity with respect to gasoline price. It is the
differential impact of gasoline price changes in our detailed cross-section of vehicles that
provide the key source of variation.
In addition to examining used vehicle prices in this section we can also describe
the impact of gasoline prices directly on scrap probabilities, suggesting the mechanism
described above. We show how in many cases relatively small changes in gasoline price
correspond to large deviations from normal scrap rates.

3.1 Effect of Gasoline Price on Used Car Prices
We first report the equilibrium impact of gasoline price on used vehicle prices
following the specification in Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer (2013). Our results match
theirs closely. We must aggregate vehicle vintages due to our coarser time series and
lack of regional variation, but our data has the advantage of measuring the effect on
vehicle prices over a much wider range of ages.4 We employ the following specification
for equilibrium price changes:

4

Busse et al (2013) observe the set of used cars sold at new car dealerships: This is the “high-end” of the
used market, where vehicles have an average price of $15,000.

8

pamt = α am + α at + β1 (gaspricet ⋅ MPGquartilem ) + β 2 zamt + ε amt

(3.1)

where subscript a is vehicle age in years, m is make and model (e.g. Toyota Camry), and
t is the year of observation. α am are fixed effects for each model-age combination (e.g. a
5-year-old Toyota Camry) and α at are fixed effects for year-age combinations (e.g. all 5year-old cars in 2009). The coefficient of interest is β1 , the influence of gasoline price
on vehicle price depending on relative fuel efficiency. Because we cannot control for
vehicle vintage within a given make-model (Busse et al (2013) are able to do this using
regional and monthly variation) we instead introduce additional controls in zamt to
account for model-specific differences in attributes across vintages. zamt includes
horsepower, weight, and the original retail price suggested by the manufacturer (MSRP).5
The estimated coefficients are positive and significant as expected: The prices of used
vehicles in more fuel-efficient MPG quartiles rise relative to prices of the least fuelefficient used vehicles. We estimate by least squares and cluster all standard errors at the
make-model-age level.
The estimation exploits a combination of time series and cross-sectional variation,
using the differential effect of a change in gasoline price across vehicles depending on
their fuel economies. The fixed effects for age by year allow the average price of
vehicles of each age to vary freely over time, and the age-model effects similarly allow
the price of each model to vary flexibly as it ages. The variation that remains is the price

5

For example, if 2003 Toyota Camrys had increased horsepower or additional features (captured in the
original retail price) we would model an increase in the value of this particular vintage as it aged.

9

differential between vehicles of varying fuel economies: We estimate the change in price
differential between the least efficient quartile and each of the higher three.
Table 2 displays the estimates of β1 in specification (3.1). Full regression output
is available from the authors. Average fuel-efficiency in the least efficient quartile is
15.4 MPG as compared with 26.7 MPG in the most efficient quartile. A $1 increase in
the gasoline price would imply a $1,762 increase in used car prices in the most efficient
quartile relative to the least efficient quartile. This compares with $1,945 between the
four quartiles in Busse et al (2013). The somewhat larger result in their data is most
likely the result of a younger age profile (Busse et al include used cars sold by new car
dealers, which tend to be newer than average).
Our sample allows us to differentiate the price changes across quartiles by age,
looking closely at the interaction between gasoline prices and remaining vehicle
lifetimes. We find that the difference in price effects drops off sharply from about $2,900
among the newest used cars to less than $1,000 among vehicles ten years and older (for a
constant $1 change in gasoline price). Busse et al (2013) argue that the price effects
across quartiles indicate near-full adjustment on the part of consumers, modeling gasoline
cost over the remaining expected life of the vehicles. This corresponds well with our
finding of smaller price effects among older, and therefore closer to retirement, used
vehicles.

3.2 Effect of Gasoline Price on Scrap Rates: Composition
We now depart from the analysis in Busse et al (2013) and begin our examination
of scrap rates. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, the scrap rate for relatively new vehicles is

10

low and rises slowly through the first five years of age. This is not surprising considering
that these vehicles still retain much of their original value; scrappage for such vehicles is
mostly the result of severe accidents yielding damage to the structure of the vehicle. We
will show that gasoline prices do not affect the scrap rate of this newer set of used cars
very much (in absolute terms) as they imply relatively small percentage changes in
vehicle value. Instead, absolute changes in scrap rates concentrate in much older vehicles
where maintenance and minor accidents yield a more flexible margin for the scrap
decision.
We repeat the specification in (3.1), now considering scrap rates in place of
prices:

yamt = α am + α at + β1 (gaspricet ⋅ MPGquartilem ) + β 2 zamt + ε amt

(3.2)

where yamt is the fraction of vehicles of age a and model m that are scrapped between
year t-1 and t. We construct scrap rates by tracking individual vehicle models of each
vintage and mapping the scrap rates as they pass different ages. Age is measured as the
difference between observation year t and vintage year v. Specifically, we define the
scrap rate as:

yamt =

nym(t−1) − nymt
nym(t−1)

(t − y) = a

(3.3)

The numerator is the count of vehicles scrapped (we observe each registration)
and the denominator is the count in the previous year. The overall measure is then the
fraction scrapped from one year to the next.

11

The results from specification (3.2) are presented in Table 3. Overall, we find
that when gasoline price increases by $1, vehicles with the best fuel economy experience
a change in their scrap rate that is about 1 percentage point less than vehicles with the
worst fuel economy. In terms of scrap counts, this corresponds to an 11% reduction in
the number of efficient vehicles that are scrapped relative to the least efficient quartile.
The effects of gasoline price changes on scrap rates are largest for the older subset
of vehicles in the sample: Among cars more than 9 years old scrap rates in the highest
MPG quartile fall by more than 2 percentage points for a $1 increase in the price of
gasoline (relative to cars in the lowest MPG quartile). On a base scrap rate of 12.8%, this
effect amounts to an 18% decline in the count of fuel-efficient vehicles scrapped.

4. Alternative Specifications
In this section we consider alternative versions of specifications (3.1) and (3.2),
now estimating the impact of gasoline price changes on used vehicles and scrap rates as a
continuous function of each vehicle’s fuel economy. We adopt a specification similar to
Li et al (2009) that allows a precise measure of the “turning points” for our effects. Our
data on prices allows us to adopt their approach not only for scrap rates, but also for used
vehicle prices. Section 5 will relax this structure and return to a more general approach.
We estimate the following models:
𝑝!"# = 𝛼!" + 𝛼! ⋅ 𝑡 + 𝛽! 𝐷𝑃𝑀!" + 𝛽! 𝑔𝑎𝑠𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒! + 𝛽! 𝑧!"# + 𝜀!"#

(4.1)

𝑦!"# = 𝛼!" + 𝛼! ⋅ 𝑡 + 𝛽! 𝐷𝑃𝑀!" + 𝛽! 𝑔𝑎𝑠𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒! + 𝛽! 𝑧!"# + 𝜀!"#

(4.2)

12

where dollars per mile, DPMmt, is calculated as gaspricet/MPGm and 𝛼! ⋅ 𝑡 is a linear
time trend that varies by age. Equations (4.1) and (4.2) impose the restriction that
vehicles at the extremes (highest and lowest DPM) will see the largest changes in price
and scrap. Specifically, if β1 > 0 and β2 < 0, there exists a critical MPG-value above
which used vehicle prices increase (or above which scrap rates decrease) when the
gasoline price goes up.
Table 4 reports the results of specifications (4.1) and (4.2), including estimates for
all vehicles (columns 1 and 3) and a restricted sample of vehicles ten years and older
(columns 2 and 4). The signs of the coefficients on gaspricet and DPMt are opposite in
all four cases, allowing calculation of the desired “turning point” in MPG where the sign
of the response changes. When gasoline price increases vehicles with fuel economies
above the turning point see their prices increase and scrap rates decrease.
For older vehicles turning points in the price and scrap regressions are similar,
between 22 and 23 MPG. To interpret the estimates in the table consider for example a
vehicle with average MPG (20.0 in our sample): A $1 increase in the gasoline price will
decrease its price by $227 and increase its scrap rate 0.34 percentage points. Vehicles
with a fuel economy of 15 MPG are predicted to respond much more dramatically: A $1
gasoline price increase decreases their value by $786 on average, and increases scrap
rates by 1.56 percentage points. Conversely, high-MPG cars benefit from higher gas
prices: The value of a 40 MPG vehicle increases by $611 following a $1 gasoline price
increase, while the scrap rate decreases by 1.49 percentage points.
These results are consistent with Tables 2 and 3. The average fuel economy in
quartile 1 is 15.2 MPG, while the average MPG in quartile 4 is 27.2. The estimates in

13

Table 4 predict a price differential of $974 and a scrap rate differential of 2.12 percentage
points. This corresponds closely to the price differential of $952 in Table 2 and the scrap
rate differential of 2.27 percentage points.
The turning point specification has the nice feature of using continuous variation
in fuel economy, but suffers from the requirement that linear trends be imposed on prices
and scrap rates over time.6 We find that this restriction leads to much less plausible
results for newer vehicles in our sample: Sharp effects of the recession, for example,
cannot be modeled and could explain the asymmetric turning points in price and scrap.
We therefore move to a more flexible specification for our main elasticity
estimates in Section 5, building a model that combines the best features of the models in
Sections 3 and 4: We will use a continuous measure of fuel economy (as in Section 4)
while maintaining the flexibility of the quartile model in Section 3 that exploits changes
in relative, rather than absolute, prices and fuel economies.

5. Estimating the Scrap Elasticity
In this section, we estimate the used vehicle price elasticity of the scrap rate7
using an instrumental variables (IV) approach. While the estimates above demonstrate
the reduced form influence of rising gasoline prices on scrap rates (and therefore could
suggest the effect of an increase in the gasoline tax), our goal here is to instead model the
effect of vehicle price changes in the used market. For example, a policy to subsidize
new vehicles of a particular type will reduce demand for used versions of those vehicles,
6

Flexible controls for year are incompatible with the turning point structure since they permit arbitrary
increases or decreases in all prices and scrap rates together, leaving the turning point undefined.
7
We will define this elasticity as the percent change in the scrap rate associated with a 1% increase in the
value of a vehicle on the used market.

14

reducing their value. This in turn creates a change in the scrap rate that we will be able to
measure.
More generally, fuel economy rules will generate a whole pattern of price shifts
through the used fleet. Our elasticity estimates in this section can be used to model the
effect of these (or other) vehicle price changes. We will show in the next section that
these effects have important implications for the performance of fuel economy standards.

5.1

Econometric Framework
We estimate the following model using a panel IV estimator, relating the natural

logs of the scrap rate y and the vehicle price p such that γ can be interpreted as the
elasticity:

ln(yamt ) = γ ln( p̂amt ) + α am + α at + ε amt

(5.1)

where 𝑝!"# denotes the predicted values from a first stage. Notice that the scrap
rate in (5.1) is a transformation of a supply curve (based on existing stocks of each
vehicle), so to identify the elasticity in question we will employ instruments that shift
demand.
In our main specification we use the differential effect of gasoline price changes
on vehicles with different fuel economies, as well as the effect of gasoline price changes
on the fuel cost of the same vintage of a particular make-model over time, as instruments.
A particularly appealing aspect of using differential changes is that is allows aggregate
changes in scrap rates for individual ages of vehicle to be removed through the temporal

15

fixed effects in αat. Most complications from the dramatic swings in macroeconomic
variables during our sample period can therefore be absorbed.
As before, the model in (5.1) also includes a full set of fixed effects for each
model-age of vehicle (e.g. a 5-year-old Toyota Camry receives its own fixed effect for
the scrap rate). The flexible age-year effects will capture patterns like improved
reliability in newer vintages (to the extent they are correlated across different models),
with idiosyncratic differences across models within a vintage appearing in the error.

5.2

Identification Assumptions
Estimating the scrap elasticity by directly regressing the scrap rate on the used

vehicle price suffers from the usual endogeneity of prices in equilibrium: We are trying to
uncover parameters that control the scrap (i.e. supply) side of the used car market,
meaning we require an instrument that shifts demand. The differential impact of gasoline
prices across used vehicle models is one such instrument; we show that the estimates are
quite similar for an alternative instrument (the current popularity of the same model as a
new car) in Section 5.4 below.
Sections 3 and 4 show how gasoline prices can predict used vehicle prices, and in
particular how the price effects operate through differential changes in demand for
vehicles with better or worse fuel economies. Our instrument therefore predicts prices
quite strongly, reflected in the high first-stage F-statistics shown alongside the
instrumented elasticity estimates in Table 5.
The validity of our instrument also depends on an exclusion restriction applying
to the supply (scrappage) side of the model: We require that unobserved factors

16

determining the scrap rate (for example, mechanics' wages, or prices of used vehicle
parts) be uncorrelated with the differential fuel cost changes across vehicle models as
gasoline prices move. Unobserved factors that affect scrap rates of all cars of the same
age similarly are not a problem in our specification: These will appear in the age by year
effects.
Another way of stating the exclusion restriction is that we need to assume that
gasoline prices affect differential scrappage of efficient and inefficient vehicles only
through their effect on vehicle prices. The recurring decision problem faced by a used
vehicle owner provides a foundation for this argument: In any given year, he faces a
random repair cost shock and must decide whether to repair and keep the vehicle, repair
and sell it at the current market price, or scrap the vehicle. He will choose to scrap it if
and only if the price in the used market falls below the realized repair cost plus any
residual value. If not, he will be better off selling the car to someone else. Thus, the
decision to scrap a car depends on the used vehicle price, repair cost realization, and
scrap value, but generally not on demand-side parameters such as utility from owning and
operating the vehicle and – importantly – not on relative fuel cost versus other models.
This conclusion does not change if there is heterogeneity in consumer preferences
across vehicles, or if consumers are heterogeneous in their valuation of fuel economy. A
potentially complicating factor is transaction cost, which can make keeping a vehicle
more attractive relative to either scrapping or selling. Under some conditions, the scrap
decision could then depend on prices of other vehicles, which in turn depend on gasoline
cost. We argue that the relevant transaction cost in our setting is likely to be limited: The
final person to face the scrap-or-repair decision for a given vehicle is likely to be a

17

mechanic or someone operating the vehicle on a salvage title. This group generally faces
lower search and information costs than a typical owner, making the scrap-or-repair
margin we have in mind the relevant choice.8
The error term in (5.1) includes some of the unobservables already mentioned
above: Mechanics’ wages, prices of used vehicles parts, and transaction costs. In
addition it will contain any vintage-specific effects. For example, there may be annual
quality differences in the fleet of new Honda Civics sold. Higher quality vintages are
likely to have lower scrap rates in each year as they age; we find some evidence in
support of this in Section 5.4.9 The estimates of the scrap elasticity are unaffected,
however, suggesting that vintage-based effects are not correlated with variation in
gasoline prices later in the vehicle's life.

5.3

Results
The first panel of Table 5 presents the elasticity estimates, γ, estimated from

Equation (5.1) by OLS. The elasticity over all vehicles averages -0.58. We expect this
result to be biased toward zero, as it reflects equilibrium outcomes coming from
uncorrelated shocks to both vehicle supply (i.e. determinants of scrap) and demand. The
remaining three panels detail our instrumental variables approach that instead takes
advantage of demand shifts based on relative gasoline cost. These panels correspond to
three different specifications for the first stage of our IV estimator.

8

This simple model can be formalized and the derivation is available upon request.
This would create positive autocorrelation in the error. “Harvesting effects,” where removal of many cars
in the previous period suggests the remaining ones are higher quality, act similarly and would lead instead
to negative autocorrelation.
9

18

Since the basic intuition for our instrumenting strategy comes out of the quartile
model in Equation (3.1) we first present results that import these estimates (appearing in
Table 2) directly as the first stage. The elasticity results from this basic specification
appear in the second panel of Table 5, with an overall elasticity estimate of -0.83.
We next move to a pair of specifications that take advantage of considerably more
variation across vehicles. Rather than lumping all vehicles of the same quartile together
to predict prices, we can add detail at the make-model level. The first stage becomes:
ln( pamt ) = α am + α at + β m ⋅ DPM mt + ε amt

(5.2)

where DPMmt measures the time-varying cost of a mile driven at the vehicle model level.
We prefer this approach to using (3.1) as the first stage since it leverages much more of
the variation in our data, creating more precise first stage estimates and also removing
bias that could result from uneven distribution of cars of different age categories across
quartiles. These results appear in the third panel where the average elasticity is -0.70.
Finally, we move to our most flexible (and preferred) specification. Now we
instrument not only with relative fuel cost changes at the make-model level, but also
differentiate by vehicle age. Specifically, our preferred first stage is:
ln( pamt ) = α am + α at + β am ⋅ DPM amt + ε amt

(5.3)

We continue to include all fixed effects as before and now predict price changes
for each make-model and age separately; DPMamt includes all variation at the age-modeltime level. The fourth panel reveals quite similar elasticities to the somewhat more
aggregate instruments used in the third panel.

19

Table 5 also explores differences in the elasticity across age categories. Generally
we find fairly similar elasticities across ages, declining somewhat for the very oldest cars.
We estimate the price elasticity of used vehicle scrappage to be about -0.7 for all vehicles
ages grouped together. Our preferred specifications indicate that scrappage of 2-9 yearold vehicles is slightly more price elastic (-0.9) than scrappage of 10-19 year-old vehicles
(-0.6). This likely reflects high existing scrap rates among the oldest vehicles.

5.4

Heterogeneity and Robustness Checks
Table 6 decomposes our elasticity estimates by vehicle class again using the

preferred instruments at the make-model-age level. Heterogeneity across classes is fairly
limited with the exception of pickups trucks: Our point estimate is a scrap elasticity of
-0.4 as compared with -0.7 in the full sample. We find somewhat more heterogeneity in
the scrap elasticity for older used vehicles, which are also the most relevant group from a
policy perspective given their high absolute scrap rates. Older pickups exhibit much
more inelastic scrap behavior, while scrappage of small and large sedans is also
somewhat less elastic (-0.5). In contrast, the scrap elasticity for older SUVs and vans is
larger than average (-0.9). Since SUVs and vans are the majority of the light truck fleet
this suggests that the scrappage of old, large vehicles on average tends to respond the
most strongly to changes in used vehicle prices.
Table 7 explores a variety of subsets of the data and alternative model
assumptions. We find that the elasticity estimates are generally robust, including to
alternative sources of variation in price:

20

Excluding luxury models: Excluding luxury models (about 25% of the make-model
combinations we see, classified on brand and price) has only a small effect on the
estimates. Average prices are of course much lower in this subset, suggesting similar
elasticities across prices within an age category.
Using only increases/decreases in gasoline price: Our point estimate is somewhat
smaller when using only years where gas prices have fallen, though it remains similar and
the difference is not statistically significant.
Log-log instead of semi-log first stage: The results from prediction using the log of
dollars-per-mile in the first stage produce very similar elasticity estimates. The semi-log
form in the main model visually fits the shape of the price data better.
Fraction of each vintage remaining: Here we include the remaining fraction of the
original production for each vintage as a regressor on the right hand side of (5.1). The
coefficient on this new variable is negative, suggesting that quality differences in
vintages are persistent over time. Including this term does not influence our elasticity
estimates, however, suggesting that this sort of variation is orthogonal to the crosssectional changes in vehicle prices.
New vehicle popularity as an alternative instrument: Here we use the popularity of the
new version of existing (older) models as an instrument. In years when new Corollas sell
well, for example, demand for used Corollas is also high. This variation is also tied to the
gasoline-price shocks in the main model, but has the advantage of being filtered through
actual demand changes in a different (newer) part of the fleet. It also includes additional
demand shocks not included above, for example negative shocks resulting from recalls.
The point estimates remain similar in magnitude to our central case but, since this

21

instrument is farther removed from the demand for the used vehicle in question, become
noisier.

6. Application to Fuel Economy Standards: The Gruenspecht Effect
We now consider the price elasticity of the scrap rate in a simulation model of the
U.S. vehicle fleet. The idea is to estimate the magnitude of the Gruenspecht effect; the
simulations reveal to what extent tighter CAFE standards lead to increased gasoline
consumption from used vehicles. The simulation model is similar in nature to the model
used in Goulder et al (2012). We refer to that paper for details, but outline the model
structure below.

6.1

Model Structure
We model the following economic agents: New vehicle producers, used vehicle

suppliers, and households. Vehicles differ by manufacturer, age (new to 18 years old),
size (large or small) and type (car or truck).
Vehicle demand is derived from the utility function of a representative consumer,
who derives utility from the various vehicles and a composite consumption good. The
representative consumer has a nested CES utility function, with nesting the following
nesting order: Vehicles vs. other goods, type, size, age, and manufacturer. At the highest
nest, the consumer chooses the mix between vehicles (v) and other goods (x) while
satisfying its budget constraint:

(

max U (v, x ) = α v v ρu + α x x ρu
v, x

)

1

ρu

(6.1)

subject to

pv v + px x ≤ M

(6.2)
22

and non-negativity constraints. M is total income, pv is the implicit rental price of the
composite vehicle (which includes expected depreciation and fuel cost), px is the price of
other goods, ρu is the elasticity of substitution between vehicles and other goods, and αv
and αx are distribution parameters.
We also model the supply of both new and used vehicles. New vehicle
manufacturers k (7 in total: Ford, GM, Chrysler, Toyota, Honda, Other Asian, European)
engage in Bertrand competition and maximize profits by choosing the prices and fueleconomies of four vehicle classes (combinations of type t and size s) subject to CAFE
fuel economy standards. The profit maximization problem for manufacturer k is given by:

max

{ pt ,s , et ,s }

∑ [( p

t ,s

t , s =1,2

− ct ,s (et ,s ) ) ⋅ qt ,s ( p, e)]

(6.3)

subject to the CAFE standards for cars and trucks:

∑ q1, s

s =1,2

⎛ q1, s
∑ ⎜⎜
s =1,2 e1, s
⎝

⎞
⎟⎟
⎠

∑ q2, s

s =1,2

⎛ q2, s
∑ ⎜⎜
s =1,2 e2, s
⎝

⎞
⎟⎟
⎠

≥ eC

(6.4)

≥ eT

(6.5)

where the decision variables pt,s and et,s denote the vehicle prices and fuel economies,
respectively. ct,s refers to the marginal production cost; eC and eT refer to the CAFE
requirements for cars and trucks.
Used vehicle supply is determined by last period’s supply net of scrapping:
qt,s,a+1,k (τ +1) = (1− yt,s,a+1,k (τ +1)) qt,s,a,k (τ )

23

a = 0,1,…,18

(6.6)

where τ indexes time, a indicates age (a = 0 refers to new cars) and yt,s,a,k is the end-ofperiod scrappage probability. All 18-year-old cars are scrapped at the end of the period.
The scrap probability for each vehicle type and vintage is endogenous and depends on the
vehicle’s resale value. A car will be scrapped when its resale value falls below the repair
costs to keep the vehicle running. Since vehicles of model t,s,a,k actually represent an
aggregate category of similar cars with different quality, condition, and value, we assume
that a fraction of these vehicles will face repair costs that are high enough to scrap the car
(rather than repairing the vehicle). This fraction is inversely related to the vehicle type’s
resale value in working condition and modeled as:

yt,s,a,k,r = bt,s,a,k,r ( pt,s,a,k,r )γ

(6.7)

where bt,s,a,k,r is a scale parameter (determined in a calibration procedure) to actual scrap
rates and γ is the price elasticity of the scrap rate, estimated above in Section 5.
The used car purchase price pt,s,a,k,r is the sum of scrap-adjusted, discounted future
rental prices rt,s,a,k,r. Used car owners are assumed to exhibit myopia in that they expect
the rental price of their used car next year to be the same as that of a one-year-older used
car this year. Under this assumption, we can recursively solve for used vehicle purchase
prices:
(6.8)

pt,s,18,k,r = rt,s,18,k,r
pt,s,a,k,r = rt,s,a,k,r +

(1− yt,s,a,k,r )pt,s,a+1,k,r
1+ δ

where δ is the annual discount rate.

24

The model solves for prices and fuel economies of new vehicles and used car
purchase prices that clear both new and used vehicle markets and are consistent with
firms’ profit-maximizing behavior. These equilibria are calculated for every year in a
sequence of equilibria over the simulation period (2009-2020).
6.2

Data and Parameters
We calibrate the model to prices and composition (obtained from Automotive

News), and fuel economies (obtained from the EPA) of the 2009 U.S. vehicle fleet, as
well as the 2009 GDP and gasoline price. We assume an income growth rate of two
percent per year, and an autonomous rate of improvement in fuel economy technology of
1.8 percent per year (Knittel, 2011). For all other parameters, we follow Goulder et al
(2012).

6.3

Used Vehicle Leakage Results
We now estimate the magnitude of emissions leakage to used vehicles as a result

of tightened fuel economy regulation for new vehicles. We consider scrap elasticity
estimates of -0.5 and -0.8, defining a range that includes our preferred estimates both for
older vehicles (an elasticity of -0.6) and the full sample (an elasticity of -0.7).
Leakage will be expressed as the fraction of expected gasoline savings that are
never realized due to changes in used vehicle scrap rates. We calibrate the model to
consider the recent tightening of federal CAFE standards to a target of 41.7 MPG in 2020
(the policy reaches 54.5 MPG in 2025).10 The reference case to which this is compared
corresponds to a previously announced goal of 35 MPG in 2020. We model the separate
requirements CAFE imposes on passenger cars and light-duty trucks.
10

EPA (2012).

25

Figure 3 (a) considers the scrap elasticity of -0.5 and shows the difference in total
gasoline consumption over the period 2009-2020 between the reference and policy cases.
The blue line ignores the impacts of the tightened CAFE standards in the used vehicle
market. The red line accounts for these effects, and reveals smaller reductions in gasoline
consumption. Both lines are downward sloping, indicating that gasoline reductions
accumulate as additional generations of fuel-efficient new vehicles enter the fleet. The
difference between the two lines is the leakage to used vehicle markets, and by 2020
amounts to about 13%: That is, 13% of the gross emissions reductions in the new vehicle
market are offset by increased emissions from used vehicles.
Figure 3 (b) displays a parallel set of results in a setting where the scrap elasticity
is increased to -0.8, close to the most elastic of our estimates (for all vehicle ages
combined) in Table 5. This larger elasticity increases leakage to used vehicle markets to
23%.11
While we believe ours is the first empirical estimate of the Gruenspecht effect, it
may be instructive to draw a comparison with the “rebound effect” estimated in a number
of earlier papers. The rebound effect refers to the increased driving as a result of lower
per-mile driving costs under a fuel economy rule. Small and Van Dender (2007) placed
this effect between 4.5% and 22.2% for the period 1966-2001, but only between 2.2%
and 10.7% for 1997-2001.12 Gillingham (2011) leverages a recent and very rich data set
to arrive at a value of about 15%. The 13-23% range we estimate here for the

11

We find that leakage to used vehicles becomes even greater when the stringency of policy is further
increased. We are currently incorporating these results, as well as simulations exploiting more detail in the
range of elasticity estimates by vehicle class and age.
12
Using a similar approach, Greene (2010) arrives at a point estimate of about 10% for the rebound effect.

26

Gruenspecht effect adds to the rebound effect as a source of leakage, rivaling or
exceeding it in magnitude.

7. Conclusions
We estimate the sensitivity of the decision to scrap used vehicles to changes in the
value of those vehicles on the used market, the scrap elasticity. Our estimates imply that
changes in used vehicle prices lead to significant changes in composition and scrappage
in the used fleet. This has important implications for fuel economy policy: Tightened
standards for new vehicles lead to reduced scrappage for used vehicles. We estimate that
this effect offsets 13-23% of expected gasoline savings. This effect is typically ignored
by policy makers, even though its magnitude rivals or exceeds the often-cited mileage
“rebound” effect.
Our empirical strategy combines variation in gasoline prices through time with
finely detailed information on used vehicle values and scrap rates. We include fixed
effects on the price and scrap rate for each vehicle model at each age of its life, using
variation from the differential effect of gasoline price on used vehicle values depending
on their fuel economies.
We find that a $1 increase in gasoline price corresponds to a $1,762 increase in
the price differential between the most and least efficient fuel economy quartiles for all
used vehicles. This is comparable to the findings in Busse et al (2013). We can also
investigate the composition of vehicles scrapped: A $1 increase in gasoline price
corresponds to an 18% decline in the number of old, but efficient, vehicles scrapped
relative to scrap of the least efficient vehicles.
27

We incorporate these effects on vehicle prices as the first stage of an instrumental
variables approach to estimate the elasticity of scrap rates with respect to the used
vehicle’s value. Our central case estimate is -0.7 with significant heterogeneity across
vehicle ages and classes. Finally, we incorporate a simulation model of the U.S. vehicle
fleet to estimate the effect of a range of scrap elasticities between -0.5 and -0.8.
Throughout this range used car price changes represent an important source of leakage.
Our findings also suggest an interesting overlap with the literature on local air
pollution: Many of the gross polluters in terms of smog and ozone precursors tend to be
the very oldest vehicles on the road. Our model and estimates of the scrap elasticity
could therefore be extended to draw direct comparisons on local air pollution between
CAFE standards and gasoline taxes
Our ongoing work looks particularly at the heterogeneity in elasticities across
class and age categories. Greater elasticity in the extremes of the fuel economy
distribution, for example, tends to magnify the leakage effect even further. We also plan
to incorporate vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in our analysis. High gas prices are likely to
lead to a higher utilization of relatively fuel-efficient used vehicles. Other things equal,
this increases their scrap rates. We find that higher gasoline prices lead to a decrease in
the scrap rate of fuel-efficient used cars, but this decrease would have been even stronger
had increased vehicle utilization not offset some of the downward pressure on scrap rates.
Our estimates of the scrap elasticity could therefore be considered conservative. In
ongoing work, we explore ways to introduce estimates of the VMT elasticity (the
“rebound” effect) in our estimation and simulation results.
