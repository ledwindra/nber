JEL No. G1,G24
ABSTRACT
For decades credit rating agencies were viewed as trusted arbiters of creditworthiness and their ratings
as important tools for managing risk. The common narrative is that the value of ratings was compromised
by the evolution of the industry to a form where issuers pay for ratings. In this paper we show how
credit ratings have value in equilibrium and how reputation insures that, in equilibrium, ratings will
reflect sound assessments of credit worthiness. There will always be an information distortion because
of the fact that purchasers of ratings need not reveal them. We argue that regulatory reliance on ratings
and the increasing importance of risk-weighted capital in prudential regulation have more likely contributed
to distorted ratings than the matter of who pays for them. In this respect, much of the regulatory obsession
with the conflict created by issuers paying for ratings is a distraction.

Introduction

Credit ratings, which are described as forward looking “opinions” of the relative credit worthiness
of an entity or debt issue, are signals of the likelihood that the terms of a credit contract will be
fully honored. They are important elements in the allocation of capital in the economy because
they can influence the cost of borrowing for issuers and the rate of return for investors.1 In this
paper we study how credit signals are provided and why they have value in equilibrium.
Many commentators on the financial crisis of 2007-2009 have argued that the major credit
rating agencies – Fitch, Moody’s, and Standard & Poor’s – played a role in the crisis by assigning
unrealistically high ratings to mortgage-backed securities, in particular to the upper tranches of
collateralized debt obligations. Credit rating agencies are singled out in the Dodd-Frank Financial
Reform Act as requiring further regulation and oversight. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission,
which studied the root causes of the financial crisis, attributed many of the failures in financial
markets to the fact that “ ...major firms and investors blindly relied on credit rating agencies as
their arbiters of risk.“2 This view of credit ratings and the firms that provide them as villains in the
financial system represents a remarkable turnaround. For more than a century the credit rating
agencies were viewed as important and valuable agents in the system, a view that was underscored
by the fact that regulators at all levels relied on them to manage risk-taking in markets.
The ratings business began in 1909 when John Moody first began to offer ratings on corporate
bonds. He was followed in 1916 by the Poor’s Publishing Company, in 1922 by the Standard
Statistics Company and in 1924 by Fitch Publishing Co. All of these publishers initially sold their
ratings directly to investors. These credit ratings clearly had value for investors because they
provided an independent assessment of the likelihood that the terms of debt contracts would be
honored and investors continued to purchase the ratings.
Financial regulators also began to view credit ratings as a valuable tool for managing risktaking in financial markets. The first distinction between investment grade and non-investment
1

This sentence waffles a bit because the direction of influence is not always the one anticipated– for example,
where sovereign ratings are concerned. These are essentially anomalies.

grade securities in regulation was made in 1931 when the Office of the Controller of the Currency
(OCC) ruled that bonds rated BBB or better could be carried on the balance sheets of banks
at book value but lower rated bonds had to be marked to market. In 1936, the Federal Reserve
Board and the OCC extended the reliance on ratings by ruling that banks could not hold bonds
that were not rated investment grade by at least two agencies. From that point on the use of the
distinction between investment grade and non-investment grade gradually spread. Throughout the
1940’s and 1950’s the insurance industry, whose companies were regulated by the states, moved
toward a system of rule-based capital requirements where ratings played the crucial role.
A major shift in the regulatory reliance on ratings occurred in 1975 when the Securities and
Exchange Commission introduced the concept of Nationally Recognized Statistical Ratings Organizations (NRSROs), initially Moodys, Standard & Poor’s, and Fitch. At the same time the
SEC imposed on broker-dealers capital requirements that relied on ratings issued by NRSROs.
Beginning in 1982 the SEC also simplified disclosure requirements for issuers of investment grade
securities. In 1974 the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act was passed and signed into
law initiating another major category of regulatory reliance on ratings. Administered by the Department of Labor, ERISA began to reference ratings. ERISA has been amended several times and
since 1989 the DOL has permitted pension funds to invest in asset backed pass-through securities
provided they are rated in one of the three highest categories by at least one of the four largest
NRSROs. In 1989 the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act prohibited
Savings and Loan organizations from investing in non-investment grade securities. And in 1991
the Investment Company Act of 1940 was amended to require money market mutual funds to
limit their investments to securities that are rated in one of the two highest categories by at least
two NRSROs. There were other modifications to regulations that further increased the reliance
on ratings but the ones just cited enshrined the use of ratings by NRSROs into the regulatory
architecture in the U.S.
Although they increased the reliance on ratings steadily over time, regulators also began to
view the ratings agencies themselves as requiring regulation when the business model changed

3

from the “investor pays” structure to an “issuer pays” model in the 1970s.3 This was a concern
because when the issuer both chooses the agency to rate its securities and pays for the rating there
is a potential conflict of interest. The issuers of credit instruments clearly want higher ratings to
lower their cost of raising capital and can shop among firms to issue that rating. This conflict
of interest has been the focus of most suspicion and criticism of the ratings business. But, credit
rating agencies base their existence on their ability to provide objective assessments of the credit
risk of securities. It is important to understand how this apparent conflict between the issuers of
ratings and issuers of debt instruments gets resolved.4 We will argue that distortions introduced
by the regulatory reliance on ratings are far more important in impairing the information quality
of credit ratings. Opp, Opp, and Harris (2013), and Bongaerts, Cremers and Goetzman (2013)
have also cited the regulatory reliance on ratings as a factor in the buildup of problems with the
CRAs.
How did the view of credit rating agencies evolve from one of trusted arbiters of credit worthiness
to suspect players in the financial system? In this paper we show how credit signals have value
by describing a financial market the includes firms, investors and providers of signals. We show
that these signals have value in equilibrium regardless of who pays for them. What causes the
signals to become suspect? We argue that the reliance on them by regulators combined with an
increase in the demand for “safe” assets relative to the supply are important factors in explaining
the evolution of the industry and the informativeness of ratings.
3

Many reasons have been offered for this evolution but a prominent one is that the advent of the Xerox machine
undermined the rating agencies’ intellectual property protection and that there was a collective action problem for
the many investors that made it easier for the ratings agencies to turn to the issuers. Perhaps an equally important
reason is that the number of firms seeking access to capital markets increased over time. There was a problem for
small and new firms who found it difficult to get rated unless they paid for it. The rating agencies were happy to
respond to this need.
4
It is important to recognize as well that the “investor pays” model would also be subject to conflicts. Currently
debt markets are dominated by a few very large firms which have significant market power.

Environment

We begin by studying the problem of a firm that wants to sell a contingent claim on the output
of a production project. The attributes of the claim can be learned with costly effort. Our goal is
to understand the role that independent assessments - by rating agencies - play in the market for
these claims. To do that, we present a model that includes firms, investors, and providers of signals
(rating agencies). We start by analyzing the behavior of the firms and investors, leaving aside the
role of ratings agencies. We consider first a one period model with two subperiods. Later we
describe a model in which the period is infinitely repeated and where we can consider the behavior
of ratings agencies.
Consider an economy where there is a single final or consumption good in each subperiod.
Investors are endowed with a storable consumption good in the first subperiod. Firms are endowed
with a Lucas fruit tree which produces output in the second subperiod. In the first subperiod the
firms sell their claims on the tree to investors. The firms care only about consumption in the first
subperiod and eat the proceeds of their sale right away. The investors care only about second
subperiod consumption They invest some of their endowment good in claims on the trees of the
firms. Their consumption is the sum of the payouts of their acquired claims and the amount of
their endowment good that they stored.
We assume that there is a unit measure of firms. Each firm starts out owning a Lucas fruit tree
which produces a stochastic dividend y. There are N different types of trees. The output of a tree
of type n is the common draw of a lognormally distributed random variable with mean φn and s.d.
σn . The measure of each type is given by µn for n = 1, ..., N. We normalize the total number of
P
firms to 1; i.e.
n µn = 1. We will assume that φn and σn are both increasing in n, so firms with
2

higher index trees are riskier but promise a higher expected return (eφn +σn /2 ).
We assume that there are also a continuum of investors, but that the number of investors is
large relative to the number of firms. This will lead the price of any individual firm’s security to
be high enough that an individual investor can only accumulate a small number of claims on any
one firm. We will assume that these investors are risk averse, have CRRA preferences, and we

5

denote their initial wealth W.. We will assume that there are I different types of these investors,
where types differ in terms of their risk aversion. We let αi denote the risk aversion of a type i
P
investor and gi their measure. We denote the total number by G = Ii=1 gi . We will assume that
the investors cannot sell insurance to each other and cannot short sell claims on the firms. As
a result of this, and the fact that investors have different degrees of risk aversion, there can be
an efficiency gain to acquiring knowledge about the risk-type of the firms so as to get the right
allocation of claims among the investors.
We assume that a fraction of the firms’ types are known, and that a firm or an investor can
get more information about a firm whose type is unknown by acquiring a signal at a cost c. For
simplicity, we will assume that the signal is a good proxy for the level of creditworthiness and
completely reveals the type of a tree (and hence of the firm). We assume that the purchasing of
signals cannot be observed. We also assume that an investor cannot bond its actions by showing
its portfolio (because, for instance, they can change their position afterwards). We denote by
γ ∈ [0, 1] the fraction of firms whose type is automatically known. So long as γ > 0, the structure
of asset markets is not determined by information acquisition and revelation decisions since all
asset types are automatically in positive net supply. However the supply of each of these assets
will be affected. So long as γ < 1, there is a potential role for information acquisition because
there are firms whose types are not known.
Remark 1 We have made a number of simplifying assumptions purely for expositional purposes.
We have assumed that we have a continuum of firms so that we can apply the law of large numbers.
This makes things analytically neat but is not essential. We could think of the firms of a given type
as also being subject to an idiosyncratic shock but, because there are a continuum of each type, the
investors can diversify away this idiosyncratic risk. Hence, we will ignore it. We could assume
that there was some prior information about the type of all of our firms. For example, we could
have assumed that there are red and green firms, and that these firms have their own distribution
of types. In this case, unrated firms would end up trading at different prices; a red firm price and
a green firm price. This would complicate the notation but not change any results.
6

2.1

No Information Acquisition

We first consider the case in which there is no additional information acquisition and hence the
fraction of known firm types is γ. All firms whose type is unknown are ex ante identical from the
perspective of an investor, and hence will trade at the same price. In addition, the firms whose
type is unknown are distributed the same as in the overall population, and hence the fraction of
type n is given by µn given our normalization that the total measure of firms is one. An investor
will find it efficient to spread his claims in this fashion since he has no information about these
firms. Hence, an investor who acquires q U evenly distributed claims on these firms is getting a
claim on their average output which we denote by Y U . Henceforth, we will assume that investors
always efficiently diversify their holdings of unrated firms.

A investor of type i can be thought of as choosing a vector of investment quantities {qni }n=1

n

Proof. To see this, assume otherwise. Then, note that some investor must be holding a positive
quantity of the unknown firms; i.e. q i,U > 0. Then this investor could reduce this quantity by ε,
s.t. q i,U − ε > 0, and acquire claims directly through purchasing εµn on each firm of type n. This
would replicate the pattern of claims on firms while increasing his storage level. This would raise
the investor’s payoff. Hence, no one would be willing to hold a claim on a firm whose type was
unknown, which contradicts market clearing.
Remark 3 The reverse arbitrage may not hold, and hence (7) can hold as a strict inequality. This
is because reverse arbitrage would require that there be an investor i who is not at a corner with
respect to his direct holdings of each type of firm; i.e. qni > 0 for all n. This may not occur in
equilibrium. As a result claims on the unknown firms can trade below their arbitrage values.
Remark 4 If γ = 0 and there is no information about the different firms, then each investor
is only investing a positive quantity in storage or the unknown type. In this case, the marginal
valuation of the different firm types 1, .., N will not be equalized across investors and the price pn
will correspond to the highest marginal valuation across the investor types i for a firm of type n.
This will ensure that all of the investors will optimally choose to invest 0 at these prices. It will
also reflect the price that a firm should anticipate receiving if it could issue a security of type n and
sell it competitively to this highest valuation investor type. Given this, it would not be surprising
that (7) held as a strict inequality.

2.2

Full Information

Consider next the case in which γ = 1 and there is full information about all of the firms. This

is simply a special case of the prior model where q i,U = 0 for each investor. Denote by pFn I

and qnF I,i the full information equilibrium prices and quantities. From this full information
equilibrium we can always set the price of the unknown firm claims equal to their arbitrage price,
or
pU =

X

pFn I µn ,

(8)

n

since at this price all of the investors weakly prefer holding a composition of claims on known firms
- with weights µn - to holding a diversified claim on the unknown firms. Hence, we are free to set
q i,U = 0.
The full information outcome can be supported without any information; i.e. γ = 0; if there are
no short sale constraints. To see this, conjecture that the price of an unknown firm, pU , is given by
(8) and that the price of a type n firm is still pFn I . If each investor acquires their per capita share
P
of the unknown firms, qiU = 1/ i gi , and {qni } of the various types, where
qiU µn + qni = qnF I,i .

(9)

Given these quantities it follows that all investors will hold the same set of underlying claims on
the different types of firms, and hence have the same level of consumption and storage. It also
follows that all markets clear since

gi qiU = 1,

i

and
X
i

gi qni =

gi qn − µn = 0.

i

i

Thus, the full information equilibrium is always an equilibrium of an economy without short-sales
constraints. This highlights the critical role of short-sale constraints in generating a motivation to
acquire information about the types of the firms.

9

The full-information can also be supported so long as there is sufficient information. To be


precise, so long as there exists quantity vectors q i,U , {qni } such that (i) (5) and (6) hold, and (ii)
qni ≥ 0 for each i and n, then we have supported the full information equilibrium allocation at
prices pF I,i and with pU given by (8). The key requirement here is that we do not violate the short
sales constraint. It is trivial to see that so long as qnF I,i > 0 for all i and n; i.e. each investor holds
a strictly positive quantity of each asset; then there will exist γ < 1 such that, so long as γ ≥ γ,
we can support the full information outcome. To understand this result note that we need to have
assets of type n in sufficiently positive supply and the unknown asset in sufficiently small supply
that each investor can adjust their overall distribution of fundamental claims so as to replicate the
distribution under full information. Note also, that so long as γ is below this threshold, there is a
potential gain to information acquisition.

2.3

Household Information Acquisition

Here we examine an investor who is considering buying information about the unknown firms. The
advantage of doing so is that the investor can buy claims on this firm at the price of an unrated
firm, pU . The disadvantage is that it must pay the information cost. If the investor gathers no
information then her payoff is still given by the solution to (1) subject to (2-4). While if she
acquires one signal, then her expected payoff conditional on drawing a signal for the firm of type
n is given by the solution to the equation

Continuing in this fashion we can define V l,i for l = 1, 2, 3, ... up to the limit implied by the wealth
constraint, which is l ≤ W/c. Denote by V 0,i the value of the solution to (1) where the investor does
not buy any signals. Because investors are small relative to firms, once an investor has acquired
a signal for each type of tree, there is no further gain to more signals. Since the probability of I
distinct signals in I trials is positive, it follows that the value of more signals goes to zero with
probability one in a finite number of draws.
We will assume that the opportunity cost c of buying a signal is large relative to an individual
investor, and hence that

V 0,i > V l,i for l ≤

W
and for all i = 1, ..., I.
c
11

As a result of this, no investor wants to buy a signal just for himself. (Note that the presence of
idiosyncratic risk would make purchasing a signal about a finite number of firms even less valuable.)
In equilibrium no investor will be able to buy a signal and then sell the information to other
investors at profit. There are two basic arguments for why this is so. First, we assumed that
the investor who buys a signal from another investor cannot verify whether or not the selling
investor actually bought the signal. Hence the seller of information would have an incentive
to sell information when they have not bought it, and to sell more information than they have
bought. Second, since information can be costlessly duplicated and resold, this implies that if the
information was sold to more than two investors its price must be zero by Bertrand competition.

2.4

Signal Buying and Revealing

Consider an arrangement in which a firm whose type is unknown pays some intermediary to buy
a signal as to their type and then make it public if the firm so chooses. Remember that these
signals are a good proxy for creditworthiness and assume for now that rating agencies will only
report honestly or not at all. A firm will want to make it’s reported type public so long as this
will raise its price relative to a firm with no reported type, or pn ≥ pU . To determine the firm’s
optimal reporting decision, let I{} denote the indicator function which takes on a value of 1 if the
statement is true and 0 if false. Then we can express the firm’s expected payoff from buying a
signal and employing the optimal revelation rule is
X



pn I pn ≥ pU + pU I pn < pU µn − c.

(10)

n

The firm’s payoff from not buying the signal is simply pU . It will choose to buy a signal or not
depending upon which of these two payoffs is larger.
Under this arrangement an investor is choosing how much to buy of each type of firm whose
type is known - either because they were initially known or bought a rating and choose to report
it - and those whose type is unknown The firms whose types are unknown are firms who did not
buy a rating or bought a rating and choose to not report it. Hence the composition of these firms
12

will be subject to adverse selection arising from the firms’ reporting decisions. So, to construct
the output of a diversified claim to all of the unknown firms we need to determine their type
composition. To do so, first denote by κ the fraction of firms whose type is initially unknown and
choose to buy a signal. Second, note that the number of firms of type n who have no reported
 

rating is (1 − γ)µn I pn < pU κ + (1 − κ) ; i.e. the firms of type n that bought a rating and did
not report it plus those who did not buy a rating and hence cannot report one. This implies that
the output of a diversified claim will be given by

where
 

I pn < pU κ + (1 − κ) µn

n [I {pn < p } κ + (1 − κ)] µn
is the fraction of firms of type n in the pool of firms whose type is unknown. It is easy to see that
if κ = 0 then the composition will be determined by the pure type distribution, µn , and adverse
selection will not play a role. However, as κ increases, then the composition will be increasingly
sensitive to the reporting decisions of the firms. When κ → 1, the unknown firms will only consist
of types who do not choose to report a rating.
Proposition 2 implies that the price of a firm whose type is unknown will satisfy

and must be strictly equal if there is any investor type who holds a strictly positive quantity of
claims on all types of firms.
The problem of a type i investor is very similar to the no information acquisition case, with
the only difference coming from the need to take account of the impact of adverse selection on the
composition of firms who do not have a known type. Their problem still involves maximizing (1),
and is still subject to the budget constraint (2) and the short-sales constraint (3), but now the
output of a diversified claim to the unknown firms is given by (11).

Note that in the market clearing conditions, the claims on a firm of type n where pn < pU
consist solely of those firms whose type was initially known. Hence, these types of firm are in zero
net supply if the fraction of firms whose type is initially known is zero. Note also that the supply
of claims on firms who did not report a rating depends both on how many of the firms bought
ratings and the extent to which these types choose to report those ratings.

Assume that γ > 0 so that all types are in positive supply. Assume that there are three kinds of
assets/firms with (φn , σn ) given by n = l, m, h meaning low, medium and high risk/return. Assume
that the expected returns are such that

pm < µh ph + µm pm + µl pl ,

(12)

so that the price of the middle type is lower than population weighted expected type. There are three
cases:
1. If c is so high that no firm chooses to become informed, then κ = 0. In which case pU is
given by the expected payoff given that the composition of firms is determined by µn , or (8).
Finally, it must be the case that the expected return from buying a rating is nonpositive, or



ph − pU µh ≤ c.

2. If c is low enough then κ > 0. Given (12), only firms of type h report their type. In which

that pm < pU . Since this inequality holds at κ = 0, this is trivially possible. Finally, we need
c to be such that

and to rationalize this reporting strategy we need κ to be big enough so that pm > pU . This is
possible since as κ → 1, pU → pl . Finally, we need c to be such that

ph − pU µh + pm − pU ≥ c.

Since in case 3, pm ≥ pU , it follows that the unrated price is lower than in case 1 or 2 and
therefore the upper bound on c for case 3 is strictly higher than the value required for case 2. Hence
this simple example trivially admits multiple equilibria coming through the strategic externality
created by the adverse selection effect. If we compare case 1 and 2, then the composition of the
unrated pool is the same, and the fraction of firms that buy a rating rises as the cost falls. When
we compare case 2 and 3, the composition of the pool changes and this can lower pU and thereby
raise the incentive to buy a rating. As a result, there may not be a simple monotone relationship
between κ and c.

2.5

The Ratings Agencies

We will now analyze the behavior of ratings agencies that specialize in rating firms. To do so,
assume now that the periods are repeated over and over with new investors and firms in each
period. Assume that the type of a firm’s tree is publicly observable at the end of each period.
Assume that there exist infinitely lived agents who can become a ratings agency by paying a fixed
cost f and that upon doing so, the cost of producing a rating for a firm is e. We will assume that
the maximum number of ratings that a ratings agency can produce is capped by x̄.
There always exists a zero-reputation equilibrium in which no one buys a rating because no
one believes that the ratings firms issue informed reports.5 Given that they don’t expect anyone
5

It is worth being clear about what we mean by “informed” here and throughout this discussion. “Informed”

16

to buy a rating in the future, any ratings agency would optimally choose to shirk and produce a
random rating. In light of this no investor would change their demand in response to a ratings
report and hence no one will choose to pay the cost of becoming a ratings agency. However there
also exist other reputational equilibria in which reputations have positive value. We turn next to
them.
We want to construct a reputational equilibrium in which ratings firms issue informed reports
and hence these reports have positive value. To do so, start by considering the net benefit from
becoming a ratings agency, let c denote the amount a ratings agency charges a firm to rate them.
Then the payoff to becoming a ratings agency that conscientiously produces x reports is given by
x (c − e)
−f
1−β
where β is the agency’s discount factor. The payoff to a ratings agency who shirks and simply
issues random ratings without paying the cost to produce informed ratings is

xc − f.

This is because with x > 0, the agency is rating a positive measure of firms, and hence they will
only be able to do this once before being detected. The ratings agencies will always prefer to
produce unbiased ratings so long as
(c − e)
> c.
1−β
The equilibrium can be one of two types depending upon whether the capacity constraint or
the incentive constraint binds in equilibrium. In a type 1 equilibrium, the ratings agencies just
break even and weakly prefer to issue informed ratings. Since the agency will always want to
lower its price by a tiny amount if this will enable it to sell at capacity, it follows that all rating
agencies will be at capacity. Since consumers are indifferent over agencies, so long as they think
as used in this paper is meant to imply that the rating is an optimal forecast of creditworthiness(type) given the
information available at the time the rating is issued. Of course, knowing the distribution from which one is drawing
is not equivalent to knowing the ex-post outcome. Hence, there is still uncertainty even with informed ratings.

17

that they are producing informed reports, all ratings agencies will have to charge the same price.
This implies that x = x̄, and the equilibrium charge, c∗ , is such that
x̄ (c∗ − e)
= f,
1−β
and
(c∗ − e)
≥ c∗ .
1−β
The equilibrium number of ratings agencies, X, is given by

X=

κ(1 − γ)
,
x̄

where κ(1 − γ) is the measure of firms who buy a rating in equilibrium.
In a type 2 equilibrium, the requirement that the ratings agencies prefer to issue informed
reports binds. In this case,
(c∗ − e)
= c∗
1−β
and the quantity that a ratings agency produces, x, must satisfy x ≤ x̄ and
x (c∗ − e)
≥ f.
1−β
In a type 2 equilibrium the ratings agencies can earn positive rents. They do not compete away
these rents because lowering their prices will remove their incentive to produce independent reports.
The number of reports that each agency produces is indeterminate, modulo the fact that their scale
has to be large enough to ensure that they break even.
The fact that the ratings industry has long been dominated by three firms suggests that the
minimum size criterion for either the type 1 or type 2 equilibrium must be fairly big to account
for this. One of the main cost factors for the ratings agencies is the need to maintain a staff of
analysts with detailed knowledge of specific industries and able to manage the large quantities of
data and other information necessary to independently assess the creditworthiness of individual
18

firms and securities. Depending on whether one thinks of these costs as being fixed or variable
with the scale of reports, they suggest that it is plausible to believe that f is large and hence the
minimum size for the type 1 equilibrium is large, or that e is large, and hence the rents per report
are small, and this necessitates a large size for the type 2 equilibrium. In recent years, there has
been some entry though the industry continues to be dominated by a few firms. This fact suggests
that the most plausible interpretation is that e is large and that the type 2 equilibrium may be
the most accurate description of the outcomes we observed.

2.5.1

Reporting Incentives

We have assumed that investors are free to buy assets in whatever proportion they desire consistent
with their budget constraint. As we detailed in the introduction, government regulation frequently
acts to limit regulated investors like banks, insurance companies and company retirement funds
on their asset choices or to impose penalties for more risky ones. At the same time, because of
regulatory features like deposit insurance or pension guarantees (via Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation), these investors often have a strong incentive to engage in risky investments. To
capture the impact of these sorts of incentive distortions in our model, assume that the government
decides to restrict type I investors who are the least risk averse to only buying firms who have
signaled that their type is 1 (the safest).
In this case, if these investors utilize ratings from an agency that is independent and “informed”
(in the sense that we have defined it), their payoff is


V I∗ = max Ey1 uI (W − q1 p1 + q1 y1 ) .
q1

However, imagine that there was a ratings agency that would rate some collection of types as type
1. Denote the set of types that it so rates by J, and since all these firms are ex ante identical, they
trade at the same price, pJ1 . Assume that everyone knows how this agency is behaving, so they will

19

correctly realize that a diversified claim to the assets in set J will yield

Y1J =

X
n

I {n ∈ J} µn
P
yn ,
n I {n ∈ J} µn

(13)

given that the ratings agency randomly chooses some fraction of initial firms to rate in this fashion
and hence the composition of the pool is the same as in the population.
Assume that arbitrage held, and that the price of these securities is given by

pJ1 =

X
n

I {n ∈ J} µn
P
pn .
n I {n ∈ J} µn

(14)

If the set J consisted of a single type of asset, then arbitrage must hold. For this to hold, it must
not only be the case that the set J is not “too large”, but also that the number of type I investors
were not too large, and may end up trading above their arbitrage price if the supply constraint
binds. Given this arbitrage assumption, the optimization problem of the type I investor is given
by


max Ey1 uI W − p1 q1 + q1 y1 − q1J pJ1 + q1J Y1J
q1

s.t. (13, 14)

(As always, we have imposed that the investor will optimally hold a diversified set of the claims
rated type 1 by our deviating agency.) It is easy to construct cases in which the type I investors
are better off buying the assets rated type 1 by the “randomizing” rating agency than buying
accurately rated assets. The type I investors will be (weakly) worse off under this arrangement
than the one in which they were unrestricted (taking the prices p1 , ..., pn and pU as given, while
the other investors will be indifferent. However, since agencies can compete over which set J they
might offer, competition will lead this special agency to choose the set J so as to maximize the
payoff of the I type investors. Denote this optimum set by J ∗ . This competition might reflect the
ability of the ratings agency to ”credibly” distort their ratings, and hence it may not be completely
optimal from the perspective of the type I investors.
Why would a ratings agency want to distort its ratings? It might have an incentive to do so in
order to increase sales of its ratings. In the process it would be distorting its ratings to help the
20

type J investors undo the impact of regulation on their investment choices. This would be most
naturally true within a type 2 equilibrium in which the rating agency is not supply constrained and
is earning positive rents on each ratings, but is barred by its incentive constraint from lowering the
price of a rating. What about how this agency rates other types of firms? Note that there is no
such incentive with respect to all of the other assets that the agency rates. Hence, the price of the
firms rated type 1 by the randomizing agency will differ from those rated by the informed ratings
companies. However, the price of their other ratings will be the same and and hence pJn = pn for
all n > 1.
Given this, what would happen to the investment demands of investors who are not type I?
The other types of investors will not want to acquire firms rated type 1 by our special rating agency
since arbitrage will imply that there is no price advantage, and they can always do better by using
the ratings of an informed agency because it will enable them to obtain their desired portfolio.
However, they will be indifferent between any firm rated n > 1 by our randomizing agency vs.
that rated by a independent agency.
What are the reputational consequences for our deviating agency? In the real world, It seems
like the ratings agencies suffered a loss of reputation only with respect to the ratings they got
wrong, that is on MBS securities. Moreover, these securities were distinct, the in them market
was initially quite large, but, when the bad realizations manifest themselves, this market rapidly
shrank. Hence, it would seem like the reputational trade-off was tilted sharply in favor of deviating.
This may explain why all of the major ratings agencies appear to have done so.

The Demand for Ratings and the Supply of Safe Assets

The example just cited is pertinent to the issues that arose during the financial crisis. The problems
arose when the ratings agencies rated bundles of credit instruments that had been assembled in the
form of Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (RMBS) or CDO’s based on them. As argued in
Acharya et. al.(2009) the key ingredient in the financial crisis was the fact that financial firms were
happy to retain highly rated tranches of mortgage backed securities they created in special purpose
21

vehicles because of the yield they offered. In the context of our model the type J investors actually
leveraged their securities while meeting the quality requirements imposed by the government. This
was how they managed to manufacture the tail risk that eventually caused the financial system to
nearly collapse.
The increasing reliance on ratings in order to risk weight assets for prudential regulation purposes increased the demand for “safe” assets - assets that met regulators standards. At the same
time the growth of shadow banking and the increased use of derivatives and repo markets dramatically increased the demand for safe assets as collateral for repo transactions and derivative
positions. Repo and derivative transactions increased sharply in the 1990s and through 2007 and
this increased demand for safe assets as collateral for short-term funding ran up against a limited
supply of government issued safe assets. In 2001 the Bank for International Settlements pointed
out that the increase in collateralized transactions that required collateral with inherently low
credit and liquidity risk had outstripped the supply of safe assets(Gorton and Ordonez 2012).
What has happened to the supply of safe assets and investment grade securities over time? In
earlier periods, the private sector and the Treasury supplied the needs of markets quite well. But,
over time, the supply of investment grade debt from the corporate sector declined relative to the
demand (Gorton and Ordonez, 2012) and the supply of Treasury debt has fluctuated over time.
Between fiscal 1992 and fiscal 1997, strong economic growth and rising tax receipts pushed
the deficit down from $290 billion to $22 billion. In fiscal 1998 the federal government recorded a
surplus of $70 billion for the first time in almost thirty years.The Congressional Budget Office at
the time predicted that the surplus would increase steadily over the next ten years and would reach
$381 billion in fiscal 2009. The shrinking deficit, and subsequent surplus, led to a concomitant
decline in Treasury financing needs. Treasury officials reduced their monthly offerings of 2-year
notes from $181.2 billion in 1996 to as little as $12 billion in 1998. Over the same interval, quarterly
offerings of 3-year notes fell from $19 billion to $10 billion and weekly offerings of 13- and 26-week
bills fell from around $14 billion each to $5.4 and $7.4 billion, respectively.6

There is currently concern over a similar shortage of safe debt because the Fed is buying over 90% of new
issuance by the Treasury

22

The demand for safe assets has led to financial innovation and the creation of privately created
“nearly riskless” assets that could fill the role of government backed safe assets and investment
grade corporate debt.
Figure 1 shows issuance of corporate debt by rating category. Over time the new issuance
declined in relative quality with the number of AAA rated corporations declining from 60 in 1980
to 4 presently.

Figure 1: Issuance of Corporate Debt By Rating
Gorton, Llewellen and Metrick (2010) showed that privately issued substitutes for government
debt and highly rated privately issued debt, together, are a roughly constant fraction of all debt
since the 1950s. Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgenson (2012) also document the relationship over
Student Version of MATLAB
time between government debt and private issued asset-backed near
riskless private debt. They

show that the net supply of privately issued debt is negatively correlated with the net supply of
government debt.
Figure 2 shows the dramatic growth in the issuance of AAA and investment grade rated RMBS
backed debt:
Many have argued that it was the complexity of the CDO’s of RMBS that enabled the agencies
to rate collections of securities of different risks as being of high quality even though the returns
reflected higher risks. Skreeta and Veldkamp (2009) argue that it was the complexity of these

securities that facilitated ratings shopping by the financial institutions that were issuing them. It
is also important to note that the regulated investors had access to inexpensive capital through
the Federal Reserve if the rated securities created liquidity problems for them. In addition it is
obvious ex-post that they had access to unpriced too big to fail Student
insurance
that
made it even more

attractive to hold assets of higher risk but with higher ratings.
It is important to note that, as in the model, the ratings agencies continued to rate literally
millions of more plain vanilla securities, corporate debt, sovereign debt and so on, where low
performing ratings would be far more apparent.

Conclusion

Much of the academic and policy discussion of the problems with credit ratings focuses on the
potential distortion created by the “issuer pays” structure of the industry. In this paper we have
argued that the issuer-pays structure is a natural outcome given the inherent problems with an
investor-pays model. We also show that reputational concerns can overcome the issuers incentives
to have biased ratings.There will always be a distortion in this environment that arises from the
fact that purchasers of ratings can choose not to reveal them. The inefficiency results because
24

information is being produced that is not being used.
The significant problems with credit ratings arose as government regulation became binding on
a large investor class and constrained their holdings of risky assets. At the same time the supply
of traditional safe assets declined, leading to newly created private sector versions of safe assets
and the ratings agencies were called on to rate a richer variety of securities.
These privately created assets were both more complex and opaque making them more difficult
to rate. Our model suggests that investors in this restricted class would have been interested
in holding riskier securities that passed the threshold because they would provide ex-post higher
returns. The experience of 2007-2009 suggests that restricted investors continued to invest in the
claims rated inaccurately even after it became clear to them that some ratings did not perform as
expected.
A key insight of our analysis is that regulatory reliance on ratings and prudential regulation
based on risk weighting is a major culprit. Without eliminating that reliance it will be difficult to
overcome the preference of regulated investors to hold assets with upwardly biased ratings. This
suggests that the usual characterization of the credit rating industry as being primarily distorted
by the incentives of the “issuer pays” model is wrong.
The regulatory reforms embodied in the Dodd-Frank Act aim to remove regulatory reliance
and put the onus on investors to certify the safety of the assets they hold. The time horizon
for implementation of this is very long and it is not clear how investors are going to replace the
services of ratings agencies. Earlier attempts to replace the reliance on CRAs and put the burden
on investors met with strong resistence from the securities industry.
