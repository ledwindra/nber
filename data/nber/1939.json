    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper studies the nature of the errors in preliminary GNP data,\nIt first documents that these errors are large. For example, suppose the\nprelimimary estimate indicates that real GNP did not change over the\nrecent quarter; then one can be only 80 percent confident that the final\nestimate (annual rate) will be in the range from -2.8 percent to +2.8\npercent. The paper also documents that the revisions in GNP data are not\nforecastable, This finding implies that the preliminary estimates are the\nefficient given available information. Hence, the Bureau of Economic\nAnalysis appears to follow efficient statistical procedures, in making its\npreliminary estimates.\n\n",
