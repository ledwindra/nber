    "abstract": "\n\nMany scholars have argued that once \"basic needs\" have been met, higher income is no longer associated with higher in subjective well-being.  We assess the validity of this claim in comparisons of both rich and poor countries, and also of rich and poor people within a country. Analyzing multiple datasets, multiple definitions of \"basic needs\" and multiple questions about well-being, we find no support for this claim. The relationship between well-being and income is roughly linear-log and does not diminish as incomes rise.  If there is a satiation point, we are yet to reach it.\n\n",
