    "abstract": "\n\nAggregate housing demand shocks are an important source of house price fluctuations in the standard macroeconomic models, and through the collateral channel, they drive macroeconomic fluctuations. These reduced-form shocks, however, fail to generate a highly volatile price-to-rent ratio that comoves with the house price observed in the data (the \u201cprice-rent puzzle\u201d).  We build a tractable heterogeneous-agent model that provides a microeconomic foundation for housing demand shocks.  The model predicts that a credit supply shock can generate large comovements between the house price and the price-to-rent ratio.  We provide empirical evidence from cross-country and cross-MSA data to support this theoretical prediction.\n\n",
