ABSTRACT
The Federal Minimum Wage, Inflation, and Employment
This study investigates the effects of federal minimum-wage policy on
minimum-wage employment, aggregate employment, and average wage rates.
The theoretical analysis focuses on the possible effect of the federal
minimum wage in constraining wages and employment in a subset of labor markets, on the possible responses of labor suppliers to these constraints,
and on the possible role of the policy of presetting the nominal minimum
wage in making monetary policy nonneutral. Among the elements of the
theoretical framework that are both distinctive and important are the
assumptions that both the demands and supplies of labor services in the
subset of constrained markets depend on the expected relative minimum wage
in the near and distant future, as well as on the current relative minimum
wage and on past levels of employment, and that the relevant expectations
of both workers and employers about relative minimum wages are "rational."
The main conclusions from this study are the following: (1) Increases
in the current or near-future federal minimum wage appear to depress current
employment in certain industries that probably have a high proportion of
minimum-wage workers and among teenagers, the demographic group that has
the highest incidence of minimum-wage workers.
(2) Neither the current nor the near-future federal minimum wage appear to
affect either current aggregate employment or average wage rates. This
finding suggests that the curtailment of employment opportunities in certain
industries and for teenagers that apparently results from minimum-wage policy
produces two types of response. First, to some extent affected workers
possibly take employment in other industries. Second, to some extent other
individuals, who are not teenagers and/or who work in other industries,
apparently increase their employment.
(3) Federal minimum wage policy and, specifically, the role of monetary
policy in determining the real value of the preset nominal minimum wage
do not seem to account even in part for the relation between monetary policy
and aggregate employment. Monetary nonneutrality apparently results from
other, undetermined, factors.
(4) The effect of proposed indexation of the federal m1n1mUm wage on the
average over time of employment of minimum-wage workers would depend inversely on the chosen relation between the federal minimum wage and recentpast average wage rates relative to the level and trend of the expected
rate of average wage inflation. The effect of proposed indexation on the
variability over time of employment of minimum-wage workers would depend
directly on the amount of year-to-year variation in expected wage inflation
relative to the amount of year-to-year variation in unexpected wage inflation.

This study investigates the effects of federal minimumwage policy on minimum-wage employment, aggregate employment,
and average wage rates.

The theoretical analysis focuses on

the possible effect of the federal minimum wage in constraining
wages and employment in a subset of labor markets, on the
possible responses of labor suppliers to these constraints,
and on the possible role of the policy of presetting the nominal
minimum wage in making monetary policy nonneutral.

The main

components of the theoretical framework are stochastic specifications of the demands and supplies for labor services in
aggregate as well as in the subset of constrained markets and
stochastic specifications of minimum-wage policy and monetary
policy.

The elements of this theoretical framework that are

both distinctive and important are the following:
tl) Both the demands and supplies of labor services in
the subset of constrained markets depend on the expected relative
minimum wage in the near and distant future, as well as on the
current relative minimum wage and on past levels of employment.
(2) The relevant expectations of both workers and employers
about relative minimum wages are "rational," which means that
these agents behave as if their beliefs about future .
wages

and policy actions are equal to the true mathematical

expectations implied by the current and past levels of these
variables and by the economy's stochastic structure.
(3)

The federal minimum wage depresses employment in the

subset of constrained markets, but, because the aggregate labor
market clears, the effect of minimum-wage policy on average wages
and aggregate employment depends on the effect that inability
to obtain employment in the subset of constrained markets has
on effective labor supply in unconstrained markets.
(4) The current and near-future federal minimum wage and
coverage are currently predetermined, but for the distant future,
which in the empirical analysis means after next year, it is
rational to expect the minimum wage to be adjusted in line with
average wages and for coverage to increase.

- 2 (5) Current monetary policy is known, an assumption that
contrasts sharply with the assumption of incomplete monetary
information made in many macroeconomic models that incorporate
rational expectations, and it is rational to predict future
monetary policy by an autoregression on current and past
monetary policy.
The analysis of this theoretical framework provides a
basis for testing of derived hypotheses, for quantification
of empirical relations, and for interpretation of empirical
results.

In what follows, Section 1 sets up the theoretical

model, Section 2 solves the model, Section 3 discusses the
data used in the empirical analysis, Section 4 reports the
results of estimating the wage and employment equations,
Section 5 presents an empirical analysis of parameter stability
over the business cycle, Section 6 analyzes the possible
effects of indexing the minimum wage, and Section 7 discusses
conclusions.
1.

Analytical Framework
The point of departure for the theoretical

ana~ysis

is

the division of labor markets into one subset in which the
minimum wage is an effective constraint on the wage rate
and another subset in which the wage rate is free to adjust
to equate quantities supplied and demanded.

The presumption

that since the establishment of the federal minimum wage
the subset of constrained markets has not been empty is based
on the observation that the wage distribution has continually
exhibited a cluster at the level of the federal minimum wage.
The first part of the theoretical analysis specifies the
supply and demand functions for labor services in the subset

-

3 -

of constrained markets and the proximate determination of
employment and excess supply in these markets.

This specifica-

tion involves the determination of behavior in the representative market in the subset of constrained markets and, also,
the determination of the size of this subset.

One basic

assumption is that the ratios of supply and demand in the
representative constrained market to aggregate supply and demand
depend on the past ratio of employment in that market to
aggregate employment, on the current ratio of the average wage
rate to the minimum wage, on the expected ratio of the average
wage rate to the minimum wage in the near and distant future,
and on time trends.

The importance of past employment and

expected future relative wages reflects mobility costs for
supply and technological adjustment costs for demand.

Another

basic assumption is that the number of constrained markets
depends positively on the current ratio of the minimum wage to
the average wage and on the current ratio of employment
covered by the minimum wage to aggregate employment.

For

simplicity, this assumption treats this coverage ratio as
strictly exogenous to the markets for labor services, even
though it actually depends on the chosen distribution of
employment and on the size distribution of firms in addition
to depending on the legal designation of covered employment.
Incorporating these basic assumptions into log-linear
supply and demand functions for the subset of constrained markets
yields the structural equations.

that, when the subset of constrained markets expands because
of an increase in coverage, the newly constrained markets
add more to supply than to demand.

where

X

is the log of the ratio of supply to employment in

the subset of constrained markets.

The presumption that since

the establishment of the federal minimum wage this subset has
not been empty implies that

X

has been positive over this

period.
Note that the variable, X, does not correspond to the
measured concept of unemployment.

The analysis does not consider

the choice that persons who are not employed make between the
alternatives of active search for acceptable employment and nonparticipation in the labor force and, hence, does not attempt
to explain measured unemployment.

In the empirical implementa-

tion of the model, employment is measured alternatively as the
fraction of the working-aged population employed and as the
number of hours worked per working-aged person.
The second part of the theoretical model specifies the
aggregate supply and demand for labor services and the
proximate determination of aggregate employment and average
wages.

The specification of aggregate supply involves a

distinction between aggregate notional supply, already
represented by L S , and aggregate effective supply.

Aggregate

notional supply measures the level of employment that
would be accepted by workers if they could obtain employment
in the markets that they prefer, given the current and
expected future structure of wage rates.

The analysis assumes

that aggregate notional supply is an exogenous variable that
grows at an exogenous rate and is subject to random disturbances.

Specifically,

-

and

is a random variable with zero mean.

In the present context, actual aggregate supply differs
from aggregate notional supply because the minimum wage causes
demand to be an effective constraint on employment in some
markets.

Aggregate effective supply equals aggregate notional

supply less that part of excess notional supply in the
subset of constrained labor markets that does not want
alternative employment in the unconstrained labor markets.
Specifically, we assume the log-linear form,
( 6)

where L

is the log of aggregate effective supply and

is the elasticity of the ratio of aggregate effective

supply to aggregate notional supply with respect to the ratio

as a constant.

The present analysis treats

a

The assumption, implicit in equation (6), that

current aggregate effective supply does not depend on expected
future values of

X

is based on the presumption that excess

supply in the subset of constrained markets mainly affects
new or recent entrants to the labor force.
The specification of aggregate demand involves the form
of an equation of exchange with employment velocity depending
positively on productivity growth, which the econometric
analysis represents as a simple time trend, and on the expected

rate of wage inflation and also sUbject to random disturbances.
Specifically,

where

M

is the log of the money stock,

V is the log of employment velocity,
r d and v are constant coefficients,
and

¢

is a random variable with zero mean.

We assume that the parameter,

v,

is small enough to insure

that the model has a unique solution.
The final assumption regarding the proximate determination
of aggregate employment is that the average wage adjusts to
equate aggregate demand with aggregate effective supply, i.e.,
(8l

This aggregate market-clearing assumption means that any
excess supply in the subset of constrained markets that wants
alternative employment in unconstrained markets can obtain
such employment.

This assumption also implies, as is verified

by the calculations below, that any effect of monetary policy
on aggregate employment depends on

a

being positive.

Thus,

in this model, the setting of the minimum wage as an effective
constraint provides the critical linkage between monetary
variables and aggregate employment.
The third part of the theoretical model specifies minimumwage policy and monetary policy.

Minimum-wage policy includes

the determination of coverage and the minimum wage in both
the short run and the long run.

The history of federal

minimum-wage legislation suggests the following observations:
(a) The law has specified future time paths for the nominal
minimum wage and for coverage criteria.

(b) The law has been

amended at intervals ranging from four to seven years.
(c) These amendments have raised the relative minimum wage to

- 8 -

between 46.2% and 55.6% of the average manufacturing wage rate.
(d) Between amendments, the relative minimum wage has declined
to between 39.3% and 47.3% of the average manufacturing wage
rate.
It is not clear why the law has specified the minimum
wage in nominal terms rather than as a percentage of the average
wage, but the above observations suggest, nevertheless, that a
long-run policy objective has been to avoid large variation in
the relative minimum wage.

In light of these observations,

the following structural assumptions about the relevant policy
variables would seem to be realistic:

First, current and near

future policy variables--specifically, nt' n t + l , Ct ' and Ct + l
are currently predetermined and known exactly.
Second, in the longer run, the presetting of the nominal
minimum wage on average equates the expected relative minimum
wage to a target level.

Specifically, the analysis assumes

that

I

is the long-run policy target for the log of ratio

of the minimum wage to the average wage rate
and

w

In incorporating the rational expectations of the future average
wage, this specification attributes the same form of rationality
to minimum-wage policy as to labor supply and demand
behavior.

The present analysis treats the target,

constant.

Monetary policy includes the determination of the current
money stock and of future increases in the money stock. Observation of the actual formulation and reporting of monetary policy
suggests that a reasonable simplification is to treat the current
money stock as predetermined and known exactly.

with regard to

prediction of the future money stock, we considered econometrically
a variety of models relating future money growth to current and
lagged values of a wide range of variables, including the wage
and emploYment variables introduced in the theoretical model,
minimum wage variables, demographic variables, and money growth
itself.

In models that included lagged money growth, the only

other statistically significant coefficient was associated with a
demographic variable , the growth in the ratio of working-aged
population to total population.

This variable, however, did

not have a statistically significant effect when, introduced into
the estimated wage and employment equations discussed below.
As a result of these experiments, we choose to model money growth
as a parsimoniously specified univariate time series.
particular, we specify an

process,

number of parameters to the analysis.

Solution of the Model
Econometric analysis of the model given by equations (1) - (11)

requires a solution that expresses the endogenous variables--the
average wage rate, aggregate employment, and employment in the
subset of constrained markets--as depending on minimum-wage policy,
on monetary policy, and on any other relevant predetermined
variables.

The procedure followed is to obtain such a solution

for W , and then to use this result to derive solutions for L
t
t
and for Nt-Lt.
Combining equations (1) -

(8) gives, after some algebraic

manipulation, the following expression for Wt as a function of
expected future values of the average wage rate, policy variables,
and other exogenous variables:

In equations (1) and (ii), expectations of future average wage
rates affect W through two channels. First, the term, vEtW + ,
t

reflects the effect of expected inflation on velocity. This

- lZ term produces a positive effect on W .

Second, the terms,

and

reflect

the effects of expected future relative wages on supply and
demand in the subset of constrained markets. If a is positive,
these terms produce negative effects on W .
t
To obtain an expression for W that we can implement
t
empirically, we use the method of undetermined coefficients to
solve out for these effects of expected future average wage
rates.

To employ this method, we conjecture the following

solution for W :

where

The

objective of solving out for

EtW t + 1 suggests the inclusion of
the variable, m , which according to equation (11.1) is a
t
determinant of expected future money growth, as well as the
variable, C + . The other variables in equation (iii) either
t l
are carried over from equation (ii) or a captured in the
constant term, TI .

Updating equation (iii) gives

Taking a rational expectation of equation (iv) and using
equations (9.1),

(10.1),

(11.1), and (ll.Z) gives

This calculation of

EtW + l sets the current expectations of
t
the future values of the stochastic variables equal to their
zero means and relates current and future expectations according

to the example,

Et(Et+2Wt+2)

= Et Wt + 2 "

To obtain the solution for W , we substitute into equat
tions (ii) and (iii) the value of EtW t + l given by equation (v).
These substitutions give two equations for Wt that have the
same form,

Equating the coefficient of each variable in equation (ii) with
the coefficient of the same variable in equation (iii) yields

- 17 The solutions given by equations (vi),

(vii), and (viii)

reveal that key properties of the model depend on the amount
by which the behavioral parameter,

a,

exceeds zero.

This

parameter, introduced in equation (6), measures the effect that
excess supply in the subset of markets in which the minimum
wage is an effective constraint has on aggregate labor supply.
First, the size of
minimum wage

a

determines the extent to which the

variables--~t' ~t+l'

Ct , Ct+l--have a positive
effect on the average wage rate and an associated negative
effect on aggregate employment.

If

a

were equal to zero, a

value that would mean that all excess supply in the subset of
constrained markets takes alternative employment in unconstrained markets, the average wage rate and aggregate employment
would be independent of minimum-wage policy.

In this case,

the sole effect of minimum-wage policy would be to reduce the
proportion of aggregate employment that occurs in the
subset of markets in which the minimum wage is an effective
constraint.
Second, the size of

a

determines the extent to which

the monetary variables--Mt and mt--are not fully absorbed in
the average wage rate and, hence, have a positive effect on
aggregate employment.

If

a

were equal to zero, the

elasticity of W with respect to M would be equal to unity,
t
t
the elasticity of W with respect to m would be positive
t

but less than the parameter, v, and L t would be independent
of both Mt and mt .
In this case, the sole real effect of
expansionary monetary policy would be to increase the proportion
of aggregate employment that occurs in the subset of markets
in which the minimum wage is an effective constraint.

These

implications reflect the property of the present model that
the setting of the minimum wage as an effective constraint in
a subset

of markets is the only source of monetary non-

neutrality.

This property results directly from the assumed

equality of aggregate demand and aggregate effective supply,
as specified by equation (8).

important aspect of the econometric results presented below

is that the estimated equations for aggregate employment
suggest that effects of minimum wage policy and monetary policy
do not conform to the relations implied by the model.

- 19 3.

Data
The econometric analysis requires the development of empirical

proxies for the variables in the model that conform as closely as
possible to the theoretical constructs.

The endogenous variables

are the average wage rate, W , total employment, L , and minimumt
t
wage employment, Nt. As an empirical proxy for W we use the
t
time series, calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics from
its Establishment Data, on average hourly earnings of production
or nonsupervisory workers on private payrolls in manufacturing.
This series is the most inclusive average wage measure that
excludes the effects both of fluctuations in overtime premiums
and of changes in the proportion of workers in high-wage and lowwage industries.

This series also seems appropriate as the

measure of average wages because, as noted above, the minimum wage
appears to maintain a fairly stable long-run relation to the
average manufacturing wage rate.
As empirical proxies for L , we experimented both with the
t
time series on gross hours worked of production andnonsupervisory
workers on private nonagricultural payrolls from BLS Establishment Data and with the time series on the total number of civilians
employed from BLS Household Data.

variables did not differ substantially between the two proxies
for L , but equations using the series on number of civilians
t
employed were more successful in controlling for the effects of
monetary variables and time trend.

This result indicates

that the estimates of the effects of minimum-wage policy variables are more reliable for this employment series, and,
consequently, the discussion focuses on this proxy for Lt.
As empirical proxies for Nt' we use the time series from
BLS Household Data on the number of teenagers employed and time
series from BLS Establishment Data for the number of production
or nonsupervisory workers on private payrolls in nine different
SIC two-digit industries that report relatively low average
wages.

Teenagers are the demographic group reporting the

highest incidence of minimum-wage employment.

The nine

- 20 industries, in which low wages suggest a high incidence of
minimum-wage employment, are Lumber and Wood Products, Furniture
and Fixtures, Miscellaneous Manufacturing Industries (which
include jewelry), Food and Kindred Products, Tobacco Manufactures,
Textile Mill Products, Apparel and Other Textile Products,
Leather and Leather Products, and Retail Trade.

with the excep-

tion of Apparel and Other Textile Products and Retail Trade,
these industries represent the two-digit industries that reported
average wage rates below $1.10 in 1947.

We included Apparel

and Other Textile Products because the average wage rate in this
industry was low relative to the above industries throughout
the latter part of the sample period.

We included Retail

Trade because of the large coverage increases that occurred in
retail employment and the relatively low average wage rate in
this industry during the latter part of the sample period.
A serious problem with using these data series to measure Nt
is that only a fraction of employment of teenagers or employment
in these industries is at the minimum wage.

This problem would

tend to bias downward the estimated elasticity of employment
with respect to the minimum wage.

If there are intra-industry

spillover effects, the bias would be even more severe.
Another problem is that each one of these industries, as
well as the demographic group of teenagers, accounts for only a
small fraction of total minimum-wage employment.

Consequently,

it seems appropriate to interpret these data to be measures of
employment in individual markets in the subset of constrained
markets, rather than total employment in this subset.

Thus,

we should expect increases in the coverage of the minimum wage
to depress employment as measured by these data, although
increases in coverage presumably would increase total minimum
wage employment.
As indicated above, each of the employment variables is
measured as a fraction of the working-aged population.

The data

on Land N in the regression equations are logs of these ratios.
The exogenous variables in the model are the current and
near-future level of the minimum wage,

~t

and

~t+l'

the current

- 21 and near-future minimum-wage coverage ratio, C and C + , and
t
t l
current and lagged values of the money stock. The measure of
~t

and

~t+l

is the log of the federal minimum wage from

published data of the Employment Standards Administration.

The

measure of Ct and C +
is the log of the average of the
t l
estimated ratios of covered workers to total employment of
production and nonsupervising personnel in the following
industries:

Construction, Transportation and Public utilities,

Wholesale Trade, Retail Trade, and Services.

These industries

are the ones in which coverage ratios increased during the
sample period.

The estimated coverage ratios are from

unpublished data of the Employment Standards Administration.
The measure of the money stock is MIB.

This procedure and the inclusion among

observations of W from 1950 to 1979. The reported statistics,

Equation I gives a confusing impression of the effects of
the current minimum wage and the near-future minimum wage on the
average wage rate.

The coefficients and associated t-statistics

on Q and, especially, on Qt+l suggest that these minimum-waget
policy variables raise W . However, the result that Pr(F > F 2 )
t
18
equals .77 indicates that according to this F-test it is highly
likely that the sample data were drawn from a population in
which Wt depends on neither Q and Qt+l.
t
Another troublesome aspect of equation (I) is the
significantly negative coefficient on C , a result that is
t
clearly inconsistent both with the theoretical model formulated
above and with any obvious and theoretically plausible alternative to that model.

The significantly negative coefficient

on Ct + l is also problematical, but it could mean that the
positive effect of the expected future average wage rate on
current demand and employment in the subset of constrained
markets, which has a negative effect on W , outweighs the
t
positive effect of the expected future average wage rate on
aggregate labor demand.
It is possible that the average manufacturing wage rate
as a proxy for W does not capture adequately changes in average
t
wage rates in other industries, such as Retail Trade, in which
coverage ratios increased greatly over the sample period.
Because of such misspecification of the dependent variable,
the negative coefficients on the coverage variables in equation I
could be measuring the effect on the average manufacturing wage
of increases in labor supply in manufacturing induced by
increased coverage in other industries.
does not support this possibility.

The evidence, however,

In particular, we re-

estimated the equation for the average wage rate using as the
dependent variable average hourly earnings of production or
nonsupervising workers on total private nonagricultural payrolls,
rather than only private manufacturing payrolls, and obtained
results substantially the same as the results reported in equation I.

-

24 -

The most likely possibilities seem to be that the troublesome
results for the coverage variable reflect either the fact that
there were only three large changes in the time series for C

t
during the sample period or the crudeness of this time series
as a measure of the coverage of the minimum wage.

For example,

these data make no apparent attempt to allow for the avoidance
and evasion of the minimum wage, practices that some studies
suggest may be widespread.
Because of these problems, we estimated the following
alternative equation for the average wage rate omitting the
variables, Ct and Ct + l :

Equation II, like equation I, uses remaining observations on W

Equation II seems to clear up the ambiguity regarding
the effects of minimum wage policy on average wages.

that this coefficient equals unity, the relevant F-test indicates

has a significantly negative effect on the average wage rate.
This result is also inconsistent with the theoretical model
specified above, and it provides an additional reason for
rejecting the implication of the model that an apparent value of

using either t-statistics or F-tests.

For example, the relevant

F-tests for equations III and IV both indicate that the probability that the sample data were drawn from a population in
which the effects of nt' n t + , and Mt sum to zero is only onel

We tested both the aggregate wage employment and the

introducing additional independent variables, such as
federal expenditures, long-term and short-term interest rates,
the ratio of working-aged to total population, and measures
of monetary velocity.

In all cases, the coefficients of

these additional variables were not significantly different
from zero and the introduction of these additional variables
did not affect substantially the coefficients of the

the current minimum wage or the near-future minimum wage have
a significantly negative effect on employment in seven of
these nine industries.

than -1.4, which corresponds to significance at the ten percent
level, we can conclude that an increase in the current minimum
wage depresses current employment in Lumber and Wood Products,

Other Textile Products, and that an increase in the nearfuture minimum wage depresses current employment in Furniture

As indicated above, the data on coverage are

crude and these effects on employment proxies that account for
only a fraction of minimum-wage employment are especially
difficult to interpret.
The curtailment of employment opportunities in certain
industries and for teenagers that apparently results from the
federal minimum wage is especially interesting in light of
the findings from equations I I I and IV that the current and
near-future minimum wage do not affect current aggregate
employment.

Taken together, the results from these equations

and from Table 1 suggest that the effects of the federal minimum
wage indicated in Table 1 produce two types of responses.
First, to

some extent, affected workers possibly take alterna-

tive employment in other industries.

Second, to some extent,

other individuals, who are not teenagers and/or who work in
other industries, apparently increase their employment.
Previous discussions of the effects of minimum wages have
focussed mainly on the first type of response, the shift of
employment from the subset of constrained markets to the subset
of unconstrained markets.

The literature has given less

attention to the second type of response, the replacement in

- 32 the workforce of individuals for whom the minimum wage is an
effective constraint to employment by other individuals for whom
the minimum wage is not a constraint to employment.

The

empirical result that the minimum wage does not seem to affect
the average wage rate implies that the decision by the replacers
to take employment does not result from a shift in the demand
for their services.

Rather, this replacement phenomenon

involves a shift in the effective supply of labor services by
the replacers, which is reflected in the inferred low value of
the parameter,

a.

The replacers are individuals who would

not choose to take employment if the minimum wage were not
preventing employment of other individuals.
Given the finding that teenagers experience a significant
amount of displacement, and assuming that to a large extent
effective labor supply decisions are made with family or household
income in mind, it seems reasonable to conjecture that many of
these replacers are adult women.

Although they have employable

skills, these adult women would prefer to be housepersons,
reflecting their comparative advantage, but the inability of
teenage family members to obtain employment and provide family income
prompts them to take employment.
To test this conjecture empirically, we estimated a
regression equation for employment of adult women that
corresponds to the regression equation for teenage employment:

The new dependent variable, denoted by G , is the number of
t
employed women aged 25 years or older from BLS Household Data.
The estimated equation for employment of adult women is
the following:

The estimated coefficients, thus, imply an estimated average

At least on the basis of these

rough point estimates, the increased employment of adult
women easily offsets the effect on total employment of the
decreased employment of teenagers.

Parameter Stability over the Business Cycle
The model developed in Sections 1 and 2 expresses the

relations between aggregate employment and minimum wage policy
andbetween average wages and minimum wage policy as functions
of the relevant supply and demand elasticities and the
parameter,

a.

The hypothesis that these underlying parameters

are constant and the fact that the reduced form coefficients
relating L t and Wt to nt' n t +l , Ct and Ct +l do not depend on
monetary variables imply that these estimated relations are
independent of the business cycle.

We can test this implication

of the theory empirically by estimating the change in the
coefficients, A , A , A , A , B , B , B , and B , over the
123

business cycle.
The test method is to re-estimate equations I-IV for
average wages and aggregate employment including an additional
variable that takes on the value of the minimum wage policy
variable during periods of average and above average ernployment
and is zero otherwise.

The estimated coefficient associated

with this variable measures the change in the relevant
minimum wage policy variable coefficient from periods of low
aggregate employment to periods of high aggregate employment.
We define periods of low employment to be those designated by
the National Bureau of Economic Research as recessions.

On an

annual basis these recessions covered 1953-1954, 1957-58,
1960-61, 1969-70, and 1974-75.
Table 2 reports the estimated movement

in the coefficients

employment.

Indexation of the Minimum Wage
This section considers the possible effects of reforming

minimum-wage policy to incorporate indexation of the nominal
minimum wage.

A feasible indexation scheme would involve

periodic adjustment in the minimum wage in accord with a wage
or price index.

The specification of an indexation scheme

would require designation of the periodicity of adjustment l
of the relevant index, and of the factor of indexation that
determines the quantitative relation between the minimum wage and
the designated index.

As a relevant example, the Congress has

recently considered an indexation scheme that would specify
annual adjustments of the minimum wage to make it a fixed
fraction of the average wage rate of the preceding year.

The

theoretical model developed above together with the results of
our empirical implementation of this model enable us to analyze
the factors that would determine how,

a minimum-wage policy

in~olving

if at alII the effects of

such an indexation scheme would

differ from the effects of the existing minimum wage policy.
Although the framework developed in this study does rot enable us
to analyze explicitly the alternative policy of indexing the
minimum wage to average prices, the choice between a wage index
and a price index would be consequential only if the behavior
of average wages differed substantially over time from the
behavior of average prices.
From the econometric analysis reported above, we concluded
that the data do not reject the hypotheses that the parameter,
a,

is zero.

The main implication of this hypothesis is that

the form of minimum-wage policy does not affect either average
wage rates or aggregate employment and that, in the context of
the present study, the only important effect of minimum-wage
policy is on the amount of employment in the subset of markets
in which the minimum wage is an effective constraint.

Conse-

quently, in considering the possible effects of indexing the
minimum wage, we focus on the amount of employment in the subset
of constrained markets relative to aggregate employment, taking

-

37 -

actual and expected changes in average wages as well as in
aggregate employment to be givens determined by other factors.
Combining equations (2) and (3)

implies that this fraction

representing relative employment in the subset of constrained
markets is given by
(a)

Based on the history of federal minimum-wage legislation,
the analysis developed above represents the existing form of
pOlicy for determining the level of the minimum wage in the
following way:
~t

and

~t+l'

yirst, the current and near future minimum wage,
are currently predetermined.

Second, in the longer

run, amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act preset the
nominal minimum wage to equate on average the expected relative
minimum wage to a target level,
constant.

y,

which we treat as a

The expectations on which this pOlicy is based

are "rational," but the carrying out of policy is subject to a
random error,

w.

The variable,

y,

does not represent the level at which

the relative minimum wage is set when the Fair Labor Standards
Act is amended.

Rather, it is the mean over time of the

level of the nominal minimum wage relative to expectations
of the average wage.

It also turns out to be, as we see in

equation (c) below, the expected long-run value of the minimum
wage relative to the average wage.

The random error,

w,

results from stochastic factors that affect either the timing
of amendments to the law or the level at which the minimum
wage is set when the law is amended.
This representation of minimum-wage policy implies, from
equation (9), that

An implicit assumption involved in the use of the expectations

wages.
Substituting equations (b-e) into equation (a) yields
the following solution for relative employment in the

This difference measures the amount by which unexpected
inflation erodes the relative minimum wage.
The indexation scheme

considered here would differ in

two important ways from existing minimum-wage policy:
First, with indexation, adjustment of the minimum wage
would be an automatic response to changes in average wages
rather than depending on a revision of expectations about
average wages on the part of policymakers.

Second, with

indexation, the setting of the minimum wage would be a backward
looking reaction to last year's average wages rather than a
forward looking anticipation of next year's average wages.
We can specify this indexation scheme as

where

and taking expectations yields
(h)

and

SUbstituting equations (g-i) into equation (a) yields
the following solution for relative employment in the subset

currently expected near future wage inflation.

For present

purposes, the important implications of equation (j) are
that relative employment in the subset of constrained markets
is negatively related to the factor of indexation minus
currently expected long-run wage inflation, a difference given
x - E t Wt + 2 , and is positively related to the amount,
given by wt - E t W + 2 , by which current wage inflation exceeds
t
expected long-run wage inflation and to the amount, given by

by

EtW t + l - E t Wt + 2 , by which expected near-future wage inflation
exceeds expected long-run wage inflation. Expected long-run
wage inflation plays a critical role in this case because it
determines the extent of the expected future erosion of the
relative minimum wage that results from the backward-looking
nature of the indexation scheme.
Comparison of equations (f) and (j) indicates that with
an indexed minimum wage the selection of the factor of indexation,
x,

relative to the expected long-run rate of wage inflation,

E W + 2 , would have the same effect on relative employment in
t t
the subset of constrained markets that the selection of the
relative minimum-wage target,

y,

has under present policy.

However, the nature of the factors that either erode or
reinforce the effects of these key policy variables differs
drastically in the two cases.

Under present policy, which

we characterize as forward looking, these other relevant factors
include the unexpected part of the current rate of wage
inflation and randomness in the carrying out of policy.

In

any particular year, these factors can have a significant
effect, but, given that expectations and policy execution are
accurate on average, the average effect of these factors over
time is zero.

In the long run, the effect of present minimum-

wage policy depends on the level of

y.

With an indexed minimum wage, which by its nature would
be backward looking, the other relevant factors would include
deviations of the current and expected near-future rates of

----. _"

- 41 -

wage inflation from the expected long-run rate of wage inflation.
In any particular year, these deviations could have a significant
effect.

Moreover, if, for example, the expected rate of wage

inflation were trending upward, these deviations would be
chronically negative, and their effect would be to depress
relative employment further in the subset of constrained markets.
If, however, the expected rate of wage inflation had no trend,
the average effect of these deviations over time would be zero.
In this case, the long-run effect of an indexed minimum wage
would depend only on the level of the factor of indexation
relative to expected long-run wage inflation.
Suppose that minimum-wage policy were changed to
incorporate this indexation scheme with the factor of indexation,
x,

set equal to the sum of the present relative minimum-wage

target,

y,

and the expected long-run rate of wage inflation,

E w +2 .
The preceding discussion implies that, if the
t t
expected rate of wage inflation has no trend, the average effect
over time of this indexed minimum-wage policy on relative
employment in the subset of constrained markets would be the
same as the average effect over time of present policy.

These

effects, however, would .not necessarily be the same in each
and every year because of the influence of the other relevant
factors--unexpected wage inflation and policy randomness in
the present case and variations in expected wage inflation in
the indexation case.

Moreover, if, for example, the expected

rate of wage inflation were trending upward,

x

would have to

to make the average

and

An important general implication of

is that we cannot draw any a priori conclusions about how, if

Conclusions
The main conclusions from this study are the following:

(1)

Increases in the current or near-future federal minimum wage

appear to depress current employment in certain industries that
probably have a high proportion of minimum-wage workers and among
teenagers, the demographic group that has the highest incidence
of minimum-wage workers.
(2) Neither the current nor the near-future minimum wage appear to
affect either current aggregate employment or average wage rates.
This finding suggests that the curtailment of employment opportunities in certain industries and for teenagers that apparently
results from minimum-wage policy produces two types of response.
First, to some extent affected workers possibly take employment
in other industries.

Second, to some extent other individuals,

who are not teenagers and/or who work in other industries,
apparently increase their employment.
(3) Although monetary policy affects average wage rates, this
relation does not seem to be equiproportionate.

In line with this

finding, monetary expansion appears to have a positive effect on
aggregate employment.

However, federal minimum wage policy and,

specifically, the role of monetary policy in determining the real
value of the preset nominal minimum wage do not seem to account
even in part for the relation between monetary policy and
aggregate employment.

Monetary nonneutrality apparently results

from other, undetermined, factors.
(4) The effects of proposed indexation of the federal minimum wage
on the average over time of employment of minimum-wage workers
would depend inversely on the chosen relation between the federal
minimum wage and recent-past average wage rates relative to the
level and trend of the expected rate of average wage inflation.
The effect of proposed indexation on the variability over time of
employment of minimum-wage workers would depend directly on the
amount of year-to-year variation in expected wage inflation relative
to the amount of year-to-year variation in unexpected wage inflation.
