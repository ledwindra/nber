Explaining Product Price Differences Across Countries

NBER Working Paper No. 13239
July 2007
JEL No. E31,F10,J3
ABSTRACT
A substantial part of international differences in prices of individual products, both goods and services,
can be explained by differences in per capita income, wage compression, or low wage dispersion among
low-wage workers, and short-term exchange rate fluctuations. Higher per capita income is associated
with higher prices and higher wage dispersion with lower prices. The effects of higher income and
wage dispersion are moderated for the more tradable products. The effects of wage dispersion, on
the other hand, are magnified for the more labor-intensive products, particularly low-skill services.
The differences in prices across countries are reflected in differences in the composition of consumption.
Countries in which prices of labor-intensive services are very high, such as the Nordic countries, consume
much less of them. For some services, the shares of GDP consumed in high-price countries are less
than 20 percent of the shares in low-price countries. Since these are services of very low tradability,
the low consumption levels of these services imply low employment in them.

Explaining Product Price Differences Across Countries
Robert E. Lipsey and Birgitta Swedenborg

1. Introduction
International differences in national price levels and prices of individual products are
striking and have persisted over long periods, despite the presumed equalizing influence of
international trade and despite the liberalization of trade and reduction of transport costs that
have occurred. For example, prices in Japan in the 1980s and 1990s were 40 percent higher, on
average, than for the OECD countries as a group. In the Nordic countries and Switzerland, prices
were 15 to 25 percent higher. In the United States, by contrast, prices were 10 percent lower, and
in Portugal 20 percent lower than the OECD average.
Individual product prices often differ even more sharply from one country to another. In
1999, for example, prices for Office Machines and Equipment in Austria were twice as high as in
the United States, and they were almost twice as high in France. Prices for Domestic and Other
Household Services in Norway were 3 to 4 times as high as in the United States and 3 times as
high as in Ireland.
Most explanations of the causes of national price differences focus on factors that affect
the prices of less tradable products, especially services, since price differences tend to be eroded
in the more tradable sectors of the economy. However, most empirical studies have analyzed
differences in national price levels rather than in prices of individual products. In an earlier
paper, the present authors examined the determinants of product prices across countries,
distinguishing between goods prices and service prices. We found that country characteristics
such as per capita income and wage compression, specifically relatively high wages of the least
skilled, raised the price of services somewhat more than the price of goods. But the difference

1

was rather small. We concluded that the dichotomy between goods and services was an
oversimplification, partly because all goods prices had a nontradable component in the form of
domestic transportation and distribution costs. We also suggested, but did not test, that the effect
of per capita income and wage compression would vary depending on the labor intensity of the
final product.
In this paper, we examine how international differences in goods and service prices are
explained by not only country characteristics, but particularly by the interaction between country
characteristics and the characteristics of the individual goods and services. We focus on the role
of a product’s tradability and labor intensity in offsetting or intensifying the effect of country
characteristics such as per capita income and wage compression. Then, we go on to show how
differences in relative prices impact the composition of consumption in different countries and,
in particular, offer an explanation as to why unskilled-labor-intensive activities are less important
in some countries than in others.
The analysis covers about 200 products across 20 OECD countries from 1985 to 1999.
Country characteristics include real per capita income, wage compression, and medium-term
fluctuations in exchange rates. The product characteristics are a product’s tradability and labor
intensity. A novel feature of our calculation of labor intensity is that we add an estimate of the
labor content of distribution to that in production.
The evidence we present indicates that high per capita income and high wage
compression, or low wage dispersion, are associated with high prices of labor-intensive and less
tradable products, reducing both consumption and production of these products in a country. The
effect of wage compression highlights a rather neglected effect of what is sometimes called a
“solidaristic” wage policy, namely, that at least part of the cost of the policy is borne by

2

consumers. While the effect of high statutory and negotiated minimum wages and the associated
labor market institutions on unemployment (e.g., Bertola, Blau and Kahn, 2001) and the structure
of employment (e.g., Freeman and Schettkat, 2001, Davis and Henrekson, 2004) have been the
subject of some analysis, their effect on prices has not received similar attention.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes briefly the explanations that have
been offered for international price differences and motivates the variables used in the empirical
analysis. Section 3 presents the regression results. Section 4 discusses the quantitative
importance of the findings on particular types of products, and Section 5 shows how relative
prices affect the composition of consumption. Section 6 concludes.

2. Explanations for International Price Differences
The traditional explanation of international differences in aggregate national price levels
attributed them to differences in real per capita income. The gross relationship between income
and unweighted averages of individual price levels for OECD countries since 1985 is shown in
Appendix Chart 1. The relationship is positive, as expected, with Japan accounting for some
extremely large positive outliers and the United States for large negative outliers. That positive
relationship is also visible in the relationship between changes in income and changes in average
prices, in Appendix Chart 2, although it is much weaker.
The traditional explanation for this positive relationship was based on the dichotomy
between services, assumed to be nontradable, and goods, assumed to be tradable and therefore
subject to the international equalization of prices through trade. International price level
differences were assumed to be concentrated in the nontradable service sector, with high per
capita income associated with high service prices. A basic assumption was that exchange rates

3

and prices of labor were determined in the tradable, or goods sector, where high-income
countries enjoyed large productivity advantages over low-income countries. The second basic
assumption was that in the service sector, productivity differences between rich and poor
countries were smaller than in the goods sector. The combination of large wage differences
determined by goods sector productivity, with small differences in service sector productivity,
caused services to be expensive in rich countries. That explanation in terms of difference in
productivity relationships is often referred to as the Balassa-Samuelson effect, although it has a
long history, going back to Ricardo (1817) . Some of the history of this explanation is described
in Kravis and Lipsey (1983).
A different explanation of the role of service industries in price level differences was
given by Kravis and Lipsey (1983) and Bhagwati (1984). Without any assumptions about
productivity differentials between goods and services, they ascribed the higher prices of services
in rich countries to the higher labor intensity of services than of goods, combined with the higher
prices of labor in the rich countries. An advantage of the latter explanation is that industry labor
intensities are easier to measure than the multifactor productivity levels relevant to the first
explanation.
The continuing series of international price and income comparisons stemming from the
International Comparison Program has made it clear that the goods-services dichotomy is an
oversimplification. “The price level for tradables…rises as income rises, despite the near
unanimity found in the literature on real exchange rates that the law of one price prevails for
tradables” (Kravis and Lipsey, 1988, p. 475).
Two earlier studies by the present authors examined food price differences across
countries and price differences in general at a fairly disaggregated level. Agricultural protection

4

played an important role in explaining large differences in food prices (Lipsey and Swedenborg,
1996). More generally, high per capita income, temporarily high currency exchange values,
high levels of protection, and wage compression, or low wage dispersion in a country’s labor
market, were associated with high product prices (Lipsey and Swedenborg, 1999).
In this paper, we examine how country characteristics interact with product
characteristics to determine the prices for individual goods and services. We focus on the
characteristics of individual products (including services), such as their tradability and labor
intensity, that might affect their response to the country characteristics, such as per capita income,
wage dispersion, and exchange rate fluctuations.
Products differ widely in their tradability, which we measure by rough estimates of
worldwide ratios of trade to consumption. The ratios range from close to zero in some services
to a median level of over 60 per cent in clothing and footwear, as can be seen in Appendix Table
1. Higher tradability for a product should weaken the effect of per capita income and wage
compression by moving price levels toward international averages
The labor intensity of a product at the consumer level incorporates not only the inputs of
labor and capital in its production, but also the transportation, and wholesale and retail trade
margins for it, and the factor intensities in these service sectors. These distribution margins differ
widely across product groups, from under 17 per cent on average in machinery and equipment, to
more than three quarters in clothing and footwear, as is shown in Appendix Table 2. We take
account of distribution costs by adding the factor intensities in the transportation, wholesale, and
retail trade industries to those in the producing industries themselves to arrive at the factor
intensities of the final products. We expect labor intensity to strengthen the effect of per capita
income and wage compression.

5

A product variable tried, but discarded, was a crude measure of the skill intensity of a
product, the average wage per worker. The variable was available at the necessary level of
product detail only from the US Input-Output tables, as was our labor intensity measure, and was
strongly correlated with labor intensity.
An extreme version of our incorporation of trade margins and transport costs in
calculating factor intensity would be to assume that all traded products are “middle products” in
the sense of Sanyal and Jones (1982), with prices at the borders equalized by competition. In
that case, the labor intensity of production of the product itself would be irrelevant, and only the
labor intensity in the nontraded transport, wholesaling, and retailing would affect the final
product price. That assumption would imply that the employment and value added in the
industry producing the product are irrelevant and should be dropped from the factor intensity
formula, leaving only the factor content in the supposedly nontraded services.
Wage compression, defined as a low level of wage dispersion in the lower parts of the
wage distribution, is measured here as the ratio of the median wage to the wage at the 10th
percentile. While not directly a policy variable, wage compression is presumed to be at least
partially a reflection of “interventionist labor market institutions” (Bertola, Blau, and Kahn,
2001, p. 6). More broadly, wage compression has been associated with minimum wage
regulations, employment protection, unemployment benefit generosity and duration, and union
strength (Freeman, Topel, and Swedenborg, 1997, Koeniger, Leonardo, and Nunziata ,2004). All
of these interventions are stronger, and wage compression is greater, in Europe than in the
United States.
The gross relationship between wage dispersion and unweighted averages of price levels
in the OECD countries since 1985, is negative, as shown in Appendix Chart 3. That negative

6

relationship is not reflected when changes in price are related to changes in wage dispersion.
Increases in wage dispersion are positively, but weakly, related to increases in prices, as can be
seen in Appendix Chart 4, although the relationship is not statistically significant.
The effect of wage dispersion on price should be larger, the more labor-intensive, and
especially the more unskilled-labor-intensive, a product is. A country in which labor markets are
relatively unregulated by law, centralized bargaining, or union power will produce products
intensive in unskilled labor cheaply, using low-wage labor. A country in which government or
union regulations make even the lowest-skill labor expensive will have high prices for products
intensive in unskilled labor, especially the less tradable ones, and, as a result, higher overall price
levels. The effect of wage compression should be smaller, the more cheaply or conveniently the
product can be traded.
Another candidate for determinant of product prices is product market regulation. A
measure of product market regulation constructed at the OECD (Conway, Janod, and Nicoletti,
2005) was tried in some equations, but did not contribute to the explanation of prices. A reason
for the failure to find effects of product regulation was given by a comparison in Blanchard and
Giavazzi (2003) between levels of product regulation and levels of employment protection
legislation, showing that the two were strongly correlated. Thus any effects of product market
regulation may be incorporated in those we find for wage dispersion.
Per capita income and wage compression are not the only country characteristics to
influence country price levels. Exchange rate changes can also do so, at least over short periods
over which prices do not fully respond to exchange rate movements. We have used as our
exchange rate variable here, deviations from nine-year averages of exchange rates. Other
variants were tried, including deviations from shorter and longer trends, and exchange rate

7

coefficients differed, but the coefficients of other variables were not much affected by the choice
of exchange rate measures.
Indirect tax levied on products sold in the country, but not on exports from the country is,
a further reason for price differences between countries. One form of indirect tax, the VAT on
food, was included separately for food prices in some calculations, but the effect was very small
on the overall equations and those results are not shown. Several other measures of the tax
burden, ranging from indirect taxes alone through comprehensive aggregates of taxes and
government expenditures, relative to country GDP, were tried but eventually discarded. The
estimated coefficients for the tax or expenditure burdens were sometimes positive and sometimes
negative, depending on the inclusion of other variables, and did little to improve the fit of the
equations.
We have not been able to take account of country differences in trade barriers on the
individual product level, a potentially important reason for price differences. Market support
estimates for agricultural products, a form of protection found to be significant influences on
food prices in Lipsey and Swedenborg (1996), are included in calculating predicted prices for the
related food products, but the coefficients are not shown here because they were not relevant for
explaining prices in general.

3. Regression results
Equations for some 200 individual product prices have been run for 1985, 1990, 1993,
1996, and 1999 data, pooled, with various combinations of year dummies and country dummies.
For comparison, we have also run equations for aggregate country price levels in the same years.
The form of the equations, with some variations, is as follows:

8

(1) PR(i,j,y) = f[ RGDPC(j,y), WD(j,y), XR(j,y), RGDPC(j,y) x TRD(i), RGDPC(j,y) x
LI(i), WD(j,y) x TRD(i), WD(j,y) x LI(i), D(j), D(y)].

Where:
PR (i,j,y) = Price of product i in country j in year y, relative to the average price of that
product in all countries in that year.
RGDPC (j,y) = Real GDP per capita in country j in year y relative to the average in all
countries.
WD (j,y) = Wage dispersion in country j relative to average in all countries in year y.
XR (j,y) = Exchange rate deviation of country j in year y.
TRD(i) = Tradability of product j, measured as the worldwide ratio of trade to output,
relative to the average tradability of all products.
LI(i,y) = Labor intensity of product i relative to the average labor intensity of all products in
year y.
D(j) = Dummy variable for country j
D(y) = Dummy variable for year y.
Definitions and measures of variables are described in detail in the appendix. Dummy variables
for products were tried, but, because each product prices was measured relative to the mean for
all countries, they were never significant and were dropped.

a. Aggregate price levels
Equation 1, pooled for all the years for which we have the individual product prices,
shows how country characteristics influence the aggregate price level in different countries. The
product in this case is the aggregate country real GDP, calculated with international weights.

Over half of the variance among aggregate national price levels is explained by per capita
income, wage dispersion, and short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate. Higher per capita
income and lower wage dispersion produce higher national price levels. Deviations of a
country’s exchange rate from a nine-year moving average produced corresponding, but
somewhat larger, deviations in the country’s GDP price level.
It might be expected that membership in the European Union, with its large free trade
area, would affect country price levels. By intensifying competition in member countries the
single market might make prices lower than they otherwise would have been. However, this
expectation is not borne out in Equation 2. There, we distinguish, in each year, between members
of the European Union in that year and non-members but find that membership had no
significant effect on the aggregate price level, or on the coefficients. One reason for this might be
that some new EU members, as well as some non-members, had previously had the benefits of a
free-trade area without actually being members of the EU. That still applies to Norway and
Switzerland, for example (under the so-called European Economic Space Agreement).

b. Individual product prices
The equation for individual product prices, pooling all products, countries, and years, is shown in
Table 1. We make no distinction between goods and services, on the ground that the ranges of
the product characteristics encompass the relevant distinctions. The equation includes one
country dummy, for Japan.
The explanatory power of the individual product price equation, in comparison to that of
the aggregate price equation, is limited by the pooling, in the sense that idiosyncratic features of
price setting for individual products in individual countries cannot be taken into account. The
one exception is protection levels for some individual food products that are included in the
equation for those products. However, there must be many other taxes, regulations, and
institutions that vary across product-country combinations, but which we have not taken into
account.
The positive influence of per capita income levels on prices is evident, but the coefficient
is considerably smaller than in the aggregate equation, partly because it is significantly modified
by international trade and product characteristics. The more tradable a product is, the smaller the
effect of per capita income on its price. The higher the labor intensity in production and

11

distribution of a product is, the greater the effect of per capita income in the consuming country
on product price. Both these interaction effects suggest that the influence of per capita income on
country price levels is to a large degree due to the fact that there is a nontradable component in
final consumption and, furthermore, that the nontradable component is often relatively labor
intensive.

Wage dispersion, at the mean level, of product tradability and labor intensity, has a
significant negative effect on product prices, much larger than that shown by the aggregate
equation. The effect is reduced by greater tradability of a product, but strengthened by higher
labor intensity.
Temporarily high values of a country’s currency are associated with high prices,
indicating that domestic prices do not change so as to offset exchange rate deviations from longterm trends.
In general we have been reluctant to use country dummies. We have made the exception
for Japan because this country is such an extreme outlier, with very high prices. A dummy
captures what we are unable to explain with the other variables. It has little effect on the overall
explanatory value of the estimates, however.
One reason for our reluctance to use country dummies is that some country
characteristics show little variation over time, and their influence could be captured by the
country dummies and attributed to them. This effect is exacerbated because we miss some
variation in country characteristics that does occur over time. Particularly for wage dispersion,
the sources from which we derive the data do not collect or do not publish them annually, and we
assume no change from the nearest date of collection. That fact adds some spurious stability to
the variable’s real stability. Wage dispersion, as we measure it, is so stable that country dummies
alone can explain almost all the variance in it —94 percent of it. Much the same can be said
about other country characteristics, such as per capita income, various measures of tax or
expenditure burdens, and measures of labor market or product market regulation. The
consequence of that stability is that it is difficult to know which stable country characteristic is
influencing prices. Therefore, a certain ambiguity arises in attributing price differences to these

13

country variables. They might be standing in for other, unspecified, stable country
characteristics that affect product prices. We try to reduce that ambiguity by adding the
interactions of the country variables with product characteristics, introducing a source of
variation not provided by the country characteristics themselves. We interpret the fact that the
interaction variables have the expected sign and are significant as providing support for our
interpretation of the country characteristics.
The inclusion of country dummy variables for all countries raises the degree of
explanation of product price differences from 20 to 28 percent (Table 2). This fixed effects
version reduces the coefficient for per capita income, now representing the effects of changes in
per capita income, by almost two thirds, but the income effect is still statistically significant.
The coefficient for wage dispersion, representing the effects of changes in wage dispersion,
becomes positive, but only marginally significant. That is a counter-intuitive result, but it
matches the positive gross relationship between changes in wage dispersion and changes in price
levels shown in Appendix Chart 4.
The significance of the country dummies indicates that our explanatory variables leave
some of the average variation in prices across countries unexplained. Beyond what can be
explained by the influence of per capita income, wage dispersion, and short-term fluctuations in
exchange rates, and their interactions with product characteristics, individual product prices in
Japan have been more than 40 percent above the OECD average, and those in the Nordic
countries and Switzerland, 17 percent or more above average. Prices in Australia, New Zealand,
Portugal, and the United States have been 13 percent or more below the average.
The significance of the country dummy variables suggests the possibility that the
standard errors might be understated by the clustering of observations within countries.

Appendix Table 3 gives the equations of Tables 1 and 2 with an adjustment for clustering
within countries. The coefficients that are affected are those for per capita income and wage
dispersion without interaction terms, representing the effects of changes in income and wage
dispersion.
Both of them become statistically insignificant when country dummies are in the
regression but remain significant and with the expected sign when they are not. Some of the
standard errors of coefficients of interaction terms are higher after correction, however.
Can country dummies “explain” prices as well as our country characteristics? Using the
country dummy variables by themselves, without including any other explanatory variables, the
country dummies “explain” almost 25 percent of the variance in individual product prices.

16

Adding interaction terms for tradability and labor intensity with the country dummies adds only
very slightly to the explanation. It does, however, modify some country dummy coefficients.
Higher product tradability slightly offsets the negative country coefficient for low-price countries,
such as Australia, New Zealand, and Portugal. It reduces the coefficient for high-price countries,
Japan, Switzerland, Sweden, and Denmark. An oddity is that it also reduces the coefficient for
the United States, a low-price country, making it a larger negative value.
The interaction terms for labor intensity are mostly insignificant, but as expected, they
add to the coefficients of the country dummies for high-priced countries, Japan, Switzerland,
Norway, and Sweden, and lower the coefficients for low-price countries, such as Portugal, the
UK and the United States.
The fact that so few interaction terms with country dummies are significant suggests that
the country dummies do not incorporate all the variation in country characteristics, such as per
capita income and wage dispersion, that we use in Tables 1 and 2. However, the fact that some
are significant suggests that the country dummies do incorporate some of those characteristics.

4. How Important Are These Price Determinants for Individual Product Prices?
How important are the price level determinants we have measured? The country with
the highest price level (aside from Japan, the price level for which we could not explain without
a dummy variable) was Norway, and the country with the lowest price level was Portugal. The
average price of a product in Norway was more than 60 per cent higher than in Portugal. The
difference in per capita income between Norway and Portugal alone, if all other factors were at
the average levels for the 20 countries, could have accounted for a difference in price levels of
those two countries of 21 per cent, according to the equation of Table 1.

17

In contrast to per capita income, wage compression is a variable directly, or indirectly,
affected by policy. The country with the widest wage dispersion, on average, was Canada, with
the United States following closely. The country with the narrowest dispersion, or the greatest
wage compression, was Sweden, with Norway and Belgium following closely. The difference in
wage dispersion between Canada and Sweden, all other variables held at the 20-country average,
was enough to make prices in Sweden a third higher than in Canada, according to the same
equation of Table 1.
The actual price level for the average product was almost 40 percent higher in Sweden
than in Canada. The effect of slightly higher Canadian per capita income in raising Canadian
prices was more than offset by the much larger effect of Sweden’s lower wage dispersion in
raising Swedish prices.
These are substantial effects on aggregate price levels. However, according to our price
equation, the effects on individual prices are modified by the characteristics of the products, such
as their tradability and labor intensity. For example, the effect of the higher per capita income of
the United States, the highest income country, relative to Portugal would be greatly reduced for
the most tradable products, jewelry, watches, and their repair, (Table 3). These would be about
the same price in the United States and in Portugal, while the least tradable product , services of
hairdressers and beauty parlors, and eggs and egg products, would be 40 percent more expensive.
High tradability, as we expected, greatly dampens the effect of income on prices.

Labor intensity also affects the impact of income differences on prices. Given the
difference in per capita income between the United States and Portugal, but setting other values
at the average levels, the most labor-intensive product, services of restaurants and take-aways,
would be more than 60 percent more expensive in the United States than in Portugal. The prices
of the least labor intensive products, electric, telephone, gas, and other public utilities and
education fees would be only about 20 percent higher in the United States.
The effects of wage dispersion, too, were modified by product characteristics, as can be
seen by comparing countries with the extremes of wage dispersion, Canada and Sweden (Table
4). Relative to Sweden, the highest wage dispersion, holding income at the average 20-country
level, reduced prices in Canada by 10 percent for the most tradable products, such as jewelry,
watches, and their repairs, but by 27 percent for the least tradable, services of hairdressers and

beauty parlors. The highest level of wage dispersion reduced the prices in Canada by almost 40
percent for the most labor-intensive products, restaurants and take-aways, but by only 21 percent
for the least labor intensive ones, public utilities and education fees.
Clearly, institutions that promote wage compression have considerable effects on
consumer prices. As noted by Björklund and Freeman (1997) in a comparison between Sweden
and the United States, if wage policy means that the less skilled are paid more than they would
have been in a more market driven system, someone has to bear the cost. Our calculations
support Björklund and Freeman’s conjecture that in the case of less-traded goods and services,
that someone is, at least partly, consumers.

5. Product Prices and Product Consumption
One consequence of higher prices for some products, whether they stem from high
overall wage levels or high prices for unskilled labor, or high distribution costs, could be a lower
level of consumption of those products, given the other characteristics of a country. Table 5
shows the logarithmic relation between the relative price of product i in country j, in comparison
to its price in other countries, and the consumption share of product i in GDP in country j,
relative to the share in other countries (pooled for all years).

Note:
a. Relative product share is the share of product i in the real GDP of country j relative to the average
share in all 20 countries.
b. Relative product price is the price of product i in country j relative to the average price in all 20
countries.
c. Relative product shares of less than 0.0005 have been truncated. As a result, 130 relative country
shares are omitted.

The negative effect of a higher relative price on relative consumption is statistically
significant in the pooled data for all years, even without any other determining variables. The
price elasticity indicated by the pooled data is .68. When we add country j real income per capita
as a determinant of relative consumption share, the price elasticity for the pooled data rises to .76.
Since we expect that these variables would have their strongest effect on products that are
the least tradable and are labor-intensive and, particularly, intensive in their use of low-skill labor,

21

we calculate the same equations for a few product groups with these characteristics. We exclude
“Local bus, bus, train, tube, tram, and taxi services” because they are likely to be publicly owned
or subsidized, and Repair and Maintenance of housing because of differences among countries in
the treatment of owner-occupied housing. The equations are shown, for five such product groups,
all in service industries, in Table 6

In all the products, the relative price coefficient is negative and significant at the 1
percent level. Per capita income is usually significant, but the coefficients range from large
positive to large negative. The relative price coefficients are in some cases larger and in some
cases smaller than the coefficient for all products in Table 5. However, the degree of explanation
is much greater for these unskilled-labor-intensive products, about 15-35 percent, as compared
with 6 percent across all products. If we exclude per capita income from the equations, the
degree of explanation hardly changes, except in the case of Laundry and dry cleaning services,
for which the income elasticity is high. The price coefficients are hardly affected by the omission
of the income variable.

22

These equations imply large differences in the shares of GDP in unskilled-labor-intensive
activities between the countries where they are high in price and those where they are relatively
cheap, other characteristics equal. The implied differences in GDP shares are shown in Table 7.
For example in a country with Denmark’s price for Laundry and dry cleaning, but all other
characteristics at the 20-country average, the share of that industry in GDP would amount to 38
percent of the typical country’s share. It would be 92 percent, almost 3 times as much, in a
country with Canada’s relative price and average characteristics in other respects. The share of
restaurants and take-aways in GDP in a country with Sweden’s relative prices for these services
and average characteristics in other respects would be 55 percent of the typical country’s share.
It would be 172 percent of the average country’s share, three times as much, in a country with
New Zealand’s relative price for these services but average characteristics in other respects.

characteristics, were associated with large differences in the consumption of unskilled-laborintensive services. Denmark really did consume much less of its GDP in the form of laundry and
dry cleaning services than Canada did. And Sweden consumed much less of its GDP in the form
of restaurants and take-aways than New Zealand did. The differences in consumption
presumably produced similarly large differences in employment in these industries, since these
are activities of low tradability.
The effects of relative prices on actual consumption may be somewhat exaggerated, since
do-it-yourself and grey market activity are especially close substitutes to services purchased in
the market in the case of these low-skill, labor intensive services. Often, the effect of high wage
costs is compounded by high indirect taxes, making grey market production especially profitable
for both firms and workers. Official statistics in Sweden, for example, recognize this and make
substantial adjustments in the published data for underreporting of income in these services, up
to 35 percent for “Hairdressing” and 16 percent for “Restaurants” in 1996 (See Davis and
Henrekson, 2006, pp. 15-16). The United States makes similar adjustments to the national
accounts, although it is hard to match them to the industry classification used here. As far back
as 1977, they were approximately 5 percent in retail trade and services (Parker, 1984, p. 24).

24

The exaggeration of the price effect depends on the extent to which the various countries adjust
their accounts for underreporting.
Nevertheless, it is likely that the consumption shares for products in general reflect also
shares in production and employment, at least in the case of low-tradability services.
Our attempts to directly relate employment to wage dispersion were severely
handicapped by the lack of employment data on anything like the product detail available for
prices. Among a group of labor-intensive industries for which employment data were available
in the OECD STAN data set, the only major group to show a strong relationship between country
wage dispersion and the industry share of national employment in 1999 was the combination of
Wholesale and Retail Trade with Restaurants and Hotels, where as much as 60 percent of the
variance in industry shares across 18 countries could be explained by wage dispersion. The
industry share was larger in countries with higher wage dispersion. Narrowing the industry
classification, at the cost of losing one country, indicates that it is the Restaurants and Hotels
industry that is the one for which the share is related to wage dispersion. However, Davis and
Henrekson (2004), in cross-sections of countries for 1991-94, 1994, and the late 1990s found that
several measures related to wage dispersion did not add significantly to the explanation of
employment or value added shares in Eating and Drinking Places and Lodging, once a tax
variable that was the sum of tax rates on payrolls, labor incomes, and consumption was included
(Table 8). Employment shares in other labor-intensive industries for which there is data, such as
Health and Social Work and Other Community, Social, and Personal Services did not show any
significant relation to wage dispersion, probably because consumption is financed in large part
by governments, rather than consumers.

25

The connection between labor market policy and employment shares is not a simple one,
however. Freeman and Schettkat (2001), comparing Germany and the United States, find that
the much higher wage dispersion in the United States partly reflects a higher dispersion of skills
in the United States than in Germany. They also find that skill differences and wage compression
are insufficient to explain the fact that Germany has relatively fewer workers in low-wage
services. While wage dispersion is greater across all industries in the United States, it is actually
greater in low-wage sectors in Germany. They suggest that wage differences may not tell the
whole story and that, among other things, one also needs to take account of Germany’s higher
non-wage labor costs (paid vacation time, payroll taxes) and tax-benefit wedges, which would
impact especially on labor intensive services. These costs, higher in Germany than in the United
States, mean that the dispersion of labor costs in Germany, and the difference from the United
States, is understated by the wage comparison.
A later paper by the same authors (Freeman and Schettkat, 2005) relates the lower overall
employment and hours inputs in the EU countries, as compared to the United States, especially
for women, to greater “marketization” of traditional household production in the United States.
But the “marketization” hypothesis, while proposed as an alternative to the “labour market
institutions” hypothesis, is really not entirely distinct from it. (Duflo, 2005) Labor market
institutions and tax wedges may influence the degree of “marketization.”, along the lines of our
explanation here.
Overall, our results tally with the findings of other studies of the effect of labor market
policies on relative employment patterns. By tracing the effect of relative prices on consumption
shares, we provide support, via a different route, for the idea (Freeman and Schettkat, 2001,
Fredriksson and Topel, 2006, and Davis and Henrekson, 2005) that the smallness of the share of

26

the low-skill, labor intensive private service sector in many European countries relative to that in
the United States is at least to some extent due to their higher price of low-skilled labor.

6. Conclusions
Per capita real income, wage compression, and exchange rate fluctuations, in
combination with the tradability and labor intensity in production and distribution of individual
products, explain a substantial part of international differences in individual product prices of
goods and services. In general, higher per capita income raises prices, and that influence is
stronger on more labor-intensive products, but weaker on more tradable products. A higher
degree of wage compression at the lower end of the wage distribution (lower wage dispersion) in
a country tends to raise prices, particularly for more labor-intensive products. The role we
hypothesized for wage compression, or wage dispersion, is reinforced by its relation to the labor
intensity of products.
The role of product tradability is confirmed by its effect on the impact of higher per
capita income; more tradable products being less affected by a country’s income level. And it is
confirmed also by its effect on the wage dispersion coefficient: The effect of wage compression
in raising product prices is weakened by high tradability of the product or service.
The role of short- or medium-term exchange rate fluctuations is also confirmed in our
data. Medium-term deviations of nominal exchange rates from longer-run trends or fluctuations
are not offset by price changes in the short run, but represent changes in real exchange rates.
Because there is limited variability over time in this set of countries in our main country
variables, per capita income and wage dispersion, and in other likely country variables, there is
some possibility that other stable country characteristics, not included in our equations, are

27

equally good explanations for the product price relationships we find. Country dummy variables
alone can account for the majority of intercountry price differences and adding them to our
standard set of variables adds to the explanation of prices. The resulting equation shows that
increases in income do raise a country’s prices, but we cannot find evidence that increases in
wage dispersion lower prices. However, the interaction of per capita income and wage
dispersion with a product’s tradability and labor intensity lends plausibility to our interpretation
of the role of these country characteristics.
All our variables combined can explain almost half of the observed aggregate price
difference between a high-price country such as Norway and a low-price country such as
Portugal. The difference in wage dispersion alone between a high-dispersion country such as the
United States and a low-dispersion country such as Belgium was enough to raise aggregate
prices in Belgium by 30 percent. The higher wage dispersion in the United States was enough to
offset the effect of higher US per capita income on US prices.
Our estimates suggest that wage dispersion is key in understanding why a high income
country such as the United States has a much larger private low-skill service sector than many
European countries. This conclusion is reinforced by our finding that a high relative price of a
product in a country is associated with a lower relative consumption of that product. The
relationship between relative price and consumption share in a country is particularly strong for
unskilled-labor-intensive products not primarily provided by governments. Since these are
mostly services of low tradability, their high prices inhibit not only the consumption of these
services, but also their production and their employment of low-skill workers.

Data Appendix
Product price is the price of an individual product in each country, measured in national
currency and converted into U.S. dollars by the average exchange rate against the U.S. dollar
during that year, as reported in OECD (2001). The individual product prices are for almost 200
categories of goods and services covered in OECD price comparisons. After conversion to $U.S.,
each product price was taken as a relative to the average price in all the OECD countries.
Real gross domestic product per capita is gross domestic product in current year
international prices, as reported in OECD (2003). The figure for each country in each year was
taken as a per cent of the average for all OECD countries.
Wage dispersion, our measure of wage compression, is measured by the ratio of the
median wage to the wage at the lowest decile. Each country’s wage dispersion in each year was
taken as a per cent of the average for all OECD countries. The wage dispersion data for years
before 1996 are from OECD (1996). Data for later years, and some revisions of earlier data,
were obtained directly from the OECD “Database on Earnings.” For maximum consistency
across countries, wage dispersion was calculated from the distribution of men’s earnings where it
was available, but for Denmark and Norway, the distributions are for the earnings of men and
women. The wage distribution of the year of the price observation was used where it was
available, but in some cases, that of the closest year had to be taken. Most of the country wage
dispersion levels varied only slowly over time.
Tradability is measured by the extent of international trade (exports plus imports) in a
product (including services), relative to the value of production. The figure for each product or
service was taken as a per cent of the average for all the products and services. For goods, the
ratios are based on UNIDO (2000), which provides export, import, and production data for ISIC

38

Revision 2 industries. Tradability is assumed to be a fixed characteristic of a product and data
for a single year are used for the calculation, 1991 for 41 countries, 1992 data for three, 1990 for
one, and 1986 for one.
We could not find corresponding international data for services. The most detailed
breakdown was for the United States, for which we used the 1997 Input-Output table of the
Bureau of Economic Analysis, which provided exports, imports, and domestic production for a
large number of services.
The exchange rate deviation for each year is calculated from nominal exchange rates
relative to the dollar, in terms of dollars per unit of other currency, from International Monetary
Fund (2002). Each country’s rates from 1970 to 2002 were averaged across years, and the series
were put in terms of relatives, with the period average = 100. These relatives were averaged
across all 19 or 20 countries, and were recalculated with the average of all countries in each year
as the base (=100). A nine-year moving average was fitted to each country’s series of relatives,
and deviations from this nine-year index form our exchange rate deviation measure.
Market support estimates are measures of agricultural protection. Market Support =
Consumer Subsidy Equivalent / (Total Consumption – Transfer to Consumers from Taxpayers) *
100, where the consumer subsidy equivalent is calculated by the OECD from data on price
differences for agricultural products between individual country and international markets. Data
are from OECD (1991 and later issues).
Labor intensity is measured as the ratio of the number of employees to the value added
in an industry. Since the prices are at the final product level, we wish to include the labor
intensity of the margin between the producer price and the final price, which we take to be the
sum of costs incurred in three broad industry groups, transportation, wholesale trade, and retail

39

trade to deliver the final product. Unfortunately, there is no subdivision of these costs according
to the product involved, so that labor intensities in these three industry groups are assumed to be
identical across all products that are transported, all that are wholesaled, and all that are retailed.
Thus, the labor intensity for a product (i) is measured as:

TC i
WTi
RTi
+ EMPWT *
+ EMPRT *
∑ TC
∑WT
∑ RT
LI =
TC i
WTi
RTi
(VA − T ) i + (VA − T ) TR *
+ (VA − T )WT *
+ (VA − T ) RT *
∑ TC
∑WT
∑ RT
EMPi + EMPTR *

where
EMPi: Employment in industry i;
EMPTR: Total employment in Transportation industries;
EMPWT: Total employment in Wholesale Trade industry;
EMPRT: Total employment in Retail Trade industry;
(VA-T)i: Value added excluding indirect taxes in industry i;
(VA-T)TR: Value added excluding indirect taxes in Transportation industries;
(VA-T)WT: Value added excluding indirect taxes in Wholesale Trade industry;
(VA-T)RT: Value added excluding indirect taxes in Retail Trade industry;
TCi: Transportation costs in industry i;
WTi: Wholesale margin in industry i;
RTi: Retail margin in industry i;
∑TC: Total transportation costs in all industries;
∑WT: Total wholesale margin in all industries;
∑RT: Total retail margin in all industries.
The labor intensity data for each product in each year was taken as a per cent of the average for
all products. Data come from U.S. Input-Output tables for 1982, 1987, 1992 and 1997. The
calculations of labor intensity for 1996 and 1999 are both based on the 1997 U.S. Input-Output
tables. Our use of U.S. data to represent the world labor intensity implies an assumption that
these product characteristics do not vary greatly from country to country.
