    "abstract": "\n\nBalance-sheet repair drove the response of a significant fraction of households to fiscal stimulus following the Great Recession.  By combining survey, behavioral, and time-series evidence on the 2011 payroll tax cut and its expiration in 2013, this papers identifies and analyzes households who smooth debt repayment.  These \u201cbalance-sheet households\u201d are as prevalent as \u201cpermanent-income households,\u201d who smooth consumption in response to the temporary tax cut, and outnumber \u201cconstrained households,\u201d who temporarily boost spending.  The asymmetric spending response of balance-sheet households poses challenges to standard models, but nonetheless appears important for understanding individual and aggregate responses to fiscal stimulus.\n\n",
