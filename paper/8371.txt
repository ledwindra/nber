Political Market Structure

Abstract
Many political markets are essentially uncontested, in the sense that one candidate raises little (or no) money and consequently has little chance of election. This
presents a puzzle in the presence of apparently low barriers to entry. Using a variant
of Baron (1989) we provide a theory encompassing both contested and uncontested
markets. The essential addition is the presence of ﬁxed costs of campaigning. We
show that these may be quite small and yet constitute decisive barriers to entry.

Federal Election Commission data reveal two striking facts about the importance of
money in politics. First, in both House and Senate races the candidate who raises the
most money wins about 90 percent of the time. Second, while most races have multiple
candidates, as many as 80 percent of races are essentially uncontested in the sense
that one of the candidates raises little (or no) money and thus has no realistic chance of
winning (Raskin and Bonifaz, 1994). Uncontested markets look like an important puzzle
because political markets apparently have low barriers to entry. We oﬀer a formal model
of political market structure which explains why uncontested markets are so prevalent.1
1

The notion of uncontested markets is distinct from the well-known notion of uncontestable markets.

1

We analyze the phenomenon of uncontested races by incorporating ﬁxed costs of
campaigning into a variant of Baron’s (1989) model of campaign contributions. Baron’s
model is typically thought to be ill suited as a general model of political market structure
since the model’s symmetry makes it most easily interpreted as a story of open seat
races where there is no incumbent. This is unfortunate since open seat races are a small
minority of all races: from 1960 through 1988 incumbents have sought reelection in
approximately 90 percent of House races and 80 percent of Senate races (Magleby and
Nelson, 1990).2
We show that if the candidate cannot raise enough contributions to cover the ﬁxed
cost of campaigning, entry is deterred. The actual threshold is higher than simply
the ﬁxed cost since contributions involve future costs to the successful candidate that
must be balanced against the beneﬁt of the money accepted in raising the candidate’s
probability of election. The deterrence is self-reinforcing since lobbies will be reluctant
to contribute to a candidate who raises a small amount of funds. Candidates who
cannot obtain funds cannot sway enough voters to get elected, and only candidates who
are likely to be elected can obtain funds. As we will show, this ‘Catch-22’ of electoral
politics can operate even if the ﬁxed cost threshold is quite low. As a result, we ﬁnd
that the introduction of a small ﬁxed cost of campaigning substantially enriches the
basic Baron model, allowing us to explain open-seat, incumbent/challenger, and single
candidate (i.e., nearly unopposed) races.
We provide a thorough analysis of Nash equilibria in the political contributions
game, characterizing both ‘interior’ Nash equilibria wherein multiple candidates actively
Fixed costs are a common element, but the contestable market idea emphasizes dynamics: the ﬁxed cost
is sunk in later periods and forward-looking investors will not commit the ﬁxed cost if the incumbent
ﬁrm will react with a price war.

According to Milyo, Primo, and Groseclose (2000) open seat races have become somewhat more
common in recent years.

campaign and also ‘corner’ equilibria wherein only one actively campaigns. In doing so
we provide a more satisfactory treatment of the existence of interior Nash equilibrium
than in Baron (1989) and Baron and Mo (1993). The Catch-22 feature can produce
an uncontested market even with symmetric candidates and zero ﬁxed costs due to a
self-fulﬁlling prophecy—the candidate cannot raise any funds because no one expects
her to win; consequently, she has no money to spend, which in turn ensures that she
cannot win.3 We provide suﬃcient conditions for the existence of interior equilibria and
derive the model’s comparative statics. The comparative statics imply that, the higher
are ﬁxed costs and the greater is the asymmetry between the candidates, the more likely
is a corner solution.
Does our model plausibly explain the prevalence of uncontested races? The qualitative results of comparative static analysis cannot reply, so we turn to simulations to
provide an answer to this question. We ﬁnd that corner solutions are the only equilibria
for much of the parameter range. For reasonable parameter values 30–60% of races
only support a single active candidate. Thus, the simulations demonstrate that ﬁxed
costs can create an uncontested race between two otherwise identical candidates. In
addition, we ﬁnd that given other types of asymmetries between the candidates (say,
initial popularity or campaign eﬃciency), single-candidate races emerge with very small
ﬁxed costs.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The ﬁrst section of the paper
brieﬂy reviews some of the empirical literature on campaign spending in Federal elections
which motivates our approach: money matters a lot, many challengers raise little money,
and money is spent for some political service such as access. Section 2 sketches the model

While such self-fulﬁlling belief equilibria are present in the basic Baron model, they are neither
emphasized nor analyzed in Baron (1989).

of political competition that is reﬂected in these data. Section 3 contains our analysis of
‘interior’ Nash equilibria in the model in which both candidates actively campaign. We
ﬁrst characterize the conditions for the existence of interior Nash equilibria and establish
conditions that guarantee when the interior equilibrium is unique. We then go on to
discuss some comparative static results (e.g., how contributions change with respect
to changes in the ﬁxed costs of campaigning). Section 4 discusses ‘corner’ solution
Nash equilibria in which only one candidate actively campaigns. In section 5 provide
simulations and verify the important role of ﬁxed costs in explaining the prevalence of
single-candidate races.

1. Money and Elections
A substantial body of empirical research has been devoted to understanding the role
played by campaign contributions in elections. These studies have identiﬁed a number
of robust, stylized facts, several of which are most relevant for our model. First, the
candidate who spends the most money wins the overwhelming majority of races. For
instance, in 1992 86 percent of Senate candidates who outspent their opponent won the
general election. In the same year, the bigger spender won 89 percent of House races
(Raskin and Bonifaz, 1994).4
Moreover, this ﬁnding can not be simply attributed to an incumbency advantage.
It is true that incumbents usually outspend challengers and also that incumbents win
about 90 percent of the time (Magleby and Nelson, 1990). It must be noted, however,
that even in open seat races the bigger spender wins almost 80 percent of House races
(Raskin and Bonifaz, 1994). Thus, while incumbency seems to provide an additional
4
While not reporting exact numbers, the discussion in Jacobsen (1978, 1980) and Abramowitz (1991)
indicates that a similar relationship between money spent and outcomes existed during the 1970s and
1980s.

4

electoral beneﬁt, it appears that chief among the many advantages of incumbency is the
greater ability to raise funds.5
Second, many races are characterized by an extraordinary low level of competition and lopsided races are becoming increasingly prevalent over time (Jacobsen, 1987;
Abramowitz, 1991). These races are essentially uncontested in the sense that the campaign contributions to the incumbent dwarf those to the challenger. And, as a result the
challenger garners very few votes.6 According to Raskin and Bonifaz (1994) “in 1992,
four out of ﬁve House incumbents faced either no challenger at all or a challenger with
so little money—less than 50 percent the amount available to the incumbent—as to be
deemed a non-serious competitor (p. 4).” Similarly, Westlye (1991) concludes that more
than half of U.S. Senate races are foregone conclusions. Finally, Levitt (1998) shows
that it is not uncommon for an incumbents to raise 100–200 times as much the money as
the challenger. Levitt notes that it is precisely the races with extraordinary diﬀerences
campaign budgets where the incumbent wins by more than 40 percentage points.
Third, access is a major–if not the primary—reason why lobbying groups make
campaign contributions. Consider, for example, that more than two-thirds of multicandidate PACs who make campaign contributions (those who contribute to more than
one candidate) also have active lobbying oﬃces in Washington (Sabato, 1984). Furthermore, Wright (1990) ﬁnds the House of Representatives’ voting decisions are best
explained by lobbying contacts they received from each side of the issue. Once lobbying
is controlled for, however, Wright ﬁnds little evidence that PAC contributions have a
direct impact on voting. In other words, campaign contributions aﬀect voting decisions
5

Other advantages of holding oﬃce include greater name recognition, franking privileges, and larger
staﬀs to provide constituent service.
6
In 1986 and 1988 the incumbent won by more than 20 percentage points in more than 85% of House
races (Abramowitz, 1991).

5

indirectly through lobbying. Snyder (1990, 1993) also ﬁnds support for the view that
contributions buy access. In his model contributions buy an asset which takes the form
of a contingent claim. Applying eﬃciency conditions on candidate and lobby behavior,
Snyder is able to derive relationships among key variables such as total contributions,
the value of such contributions, and election outcomes. Using data from U.S. House and
Senate Snyder uses these equilibrium conditions to estimate implications of the model
and ﬁnds support for the notion of contributions as investments.7

2. The Model
Following Baron (1989) we consider a model with two politicians who simultaneously
advertise and campaign (a set of activities we collectively call ‘eﬀort’) in order to sway
rationally ignorant voters. For convenience we will refer to one candidate as the ‘incumbent’ and the other as the ‘challenger.’ The labels merely point to potential asymmetry
in favor of the incumbent, neither implying nor ruling out that one of the candidates
already holds oﬃce.
The objective probability of candidate i being elected is assumed to be equal to

p=

µeβi
µeβi + (1 − µ)eβc

,

β < 1, 0 < µ < 1

(1)

where e denotes candidate eﬀort. The indices i and c refer to the incumbent and challenger, respectively. The parameter β < 1 implies that there is diminishing marginal
eﬀectiveness to eﬀort. The parameter µ captures the potential asymmetry of relative
eﬀort levels: for equal eﬀorts, ei /ec = 1, p = µ. Eﬀort is comprised of an exogenous
7

Other studies that ﬁnd support for the access interpretation of PAC contributions include Grier
and Munger (1991a,b), Hall and Wayman (1990), McCarty and Rothenberg (1996), Milyo (1997a,b),
Romer and Snyder (1994), and Snyder (1991, 1992).

component e ≥ 0 representing ideological attachment or sunk eﬀort and an endogenous component E which must be ﬁnanced by the candidate. Overall campaign eﬀort,
therefore, can be written ej = ej + Ej ; j = i.c.
Candidate j, j = i, c ﬁnances her campaign by accepting Hj contributions from
a large set of potential contributors. The contributions have value to the politician
because they allow her to buy advertising (or more broadly, exert ‘eﬀort’) that increases
her probability of election.8 The cost of campaigning is

Cj = Kj + bj Ej ,

j = i, c,

where Ej is the endogenous portion of candidate eﬀort, Kj is the ﬁxed cost of campaigning, and bj is the marginal cost. Ej > 0 requires Cj > Kj . The ﬁxed cost represents a
threshold ability to spend which must be met to hire a campaign manager (who must
be convinced that the campaign has some reasonable chance of success), rent an oﬃce
and so forth. Solving for Ej , Ej = (Cj − Kj )/bj .
Each candidate obtains money to ﬁnance her campaign from donors. Our view is
that money is exchanged for access, called inﬂuence here to emphasize its strategic
potential. To capture this interpretation, we assume that each active donor purchases
one unit of access, rationalized as ‘buying’ an option on the elected oﬃcial’s future time,
whereby she implicitly promises to listen, possibly read a position paper, give a reasoned
response to the donor, etc.9 Lobbies value access as an opportunity to get the politician
to process costly (to the politician) information, expecting that the information may
alter the politician’s behavior favorably. The information must be created at some
8

In the U.S. system, campaign contributions cannot be converted to personal income.
The amounts typically donated are consistent with this notion of purchasing some hours of time of
the politician and her staﬀ. Empirically, the median value of contributions is around $1500, far below
the FEC limit of $10,000 for a House race and $25,000 for a Senate race.

additional cost (e.g., preparing the report, taking polls), and the signal value of the
lobby’s information is based on its veriﬁable production cost.10 The interpretation
oﬀered here need not include the idea of ‘buying’ the politician’s vote, or even buying
a lottery ticket to the politician’s vote. The main idea is more palatable: political
information processing is costly, and a price system arises in politics to allocate resources
to this task.
Critically, we assume that access must be purchased prior to its use. This seems to ﬁt
casual empiricism.11 There are also solid theoretical grounds for the assumed structure.
Incumbent politicians who are thought to allow access at the donors’ convenience will
be unable to raise funds, save as in payment for service. This may yield lower revenue
since a much smaller group of clients will pay. Moreover, with a small group of clients
the payment may be negotiated on less favorable terms, since the situation tends toward
bilateral monopoly. Finally, the payment for service type of behavior may lead to an
advantage to the politician’s rival if it is publicized.12
The value of access to the donor is private information, and heterogeneity creates an
extensive margin, leading to downward sloping, concave demand, v(Hj ). Since politicians do not know the value of access to individuals, they cannot price discriminate.
10
Austen-Smith (1995) has critiqued the access story because a lobby will only be believed if it has
coincident interest to the politician, in which case the lobby need not pay for access. He bases a rationale
for the access model in a rational choice signaling game in which the politician is uncertain about the
lobby’s interest. This is unnecessarily complicated in our view since the cost of creating the signal is
like a performance bond, wherein lies can be uncovered by the politician’s eﬀort but result in loss of the
bond to the lobby. We also think that reputation is important in providing credibility on both sides of
the information exchange between lobbies and politicians.
11
The post-1994 election oﬀer by the Congressional Republicans to allow those who did not contribute previously to make contributions to an elections debt repayment fund seems exceptional. It is
nevertheless diﬃcult to believe that access was granted to latecomers on the same basis as the early
birds.
12
The oﬀer to late-comers of the previous footnote may maintain the credibility of normally denying
access due to the surprise of the shift in control of Congress to the Republicans.

8

Thus all contributions to a single politician are at the same rate.13
If elected, each candidate faces some chance of having to grant access to those to
whom it was sold. For simplicity, we assume there is a probability π of having to grant
access to the entire group (each contributor subsequently receives a realization of a
random iid process determining exercise of the option to access). The ex ante value (to
the donor) of the exchange depends on the probability of the candidate being elected,
which is taken as exogenous by the donor, but must be rational in equilibrium. Hence,
the ex ante price for access is pπv(Hi ) for the incumbent and [1 − p]πv(Hc ) for the
challenger. Substituting we can express endogenous eﬀort as
Ei (Hi ) = [pπv(Hi )Hi − Ki ]/bi ,

(2)

Ec (Hc ) = [(1 − p)πv(Hc )Hc − Kc ]/bc .

(3)

Given this setup, we show in the appendix that the probability that the incumbent is
elected can be expressed as a reduced form correspondence, i.e., p = P (Hi , Hc , Ki , Kc ).
In the appendix we also establish a condition that guarantees the uniqueness of the
probability p for a given (Hi , Hc , Ki , Kc ). The same condition also guarantees PHi > 0 ,
PHc < 0, PKi < 0, PKc > 0. Loosely speaking, this condition requires the ﬁxed costs of
campaigning be relatively small relative to exogenous eﬀort. Intuitively, the condition
means that if exogenous campaign eﬀort is large enough, a candidate will campaign
even without raising campaign funds. By contrast, in Baron’s model there are always
multiple solutions for p given (Hi , Hc , Ki , Kc ).
Politicians do not sell unbounded amounts of access because it is costly for a politician to listen to a petitioner’s case: staﬀ time and the politician’s own time must be
13
Uniform contributions rates are counterfactual and the observed price dispersion implies that politicians do know the value of access in some cases. Uniformity is a harmless simpliﬁcation nonetheless.

diverted from other business. If access is granted, Ω(Hi ) is the cost to the incumbent
and Γ(Hc ) is the cost to the challenger. The cost functions are increasing and convex
in the number of units of access sold due to each politician’s limited capacity to handle
access. If we let W denote the value of being elected, we can write the expected utility
of the (risk neutral) candidate as
ψ i = [W − πΩ(Hi )]P (Hi , Hc , Ki , Kc ),
ψ c = [W − πΓ(Hc )[1 − P (Hi , Hc , Ki , Kc )].

3. Nash equilibria of contested races
Each candidate maximizes her expected utility with respect to the number of units of
access she sells. The ﬁrst order conditions for an interior solution to each candidate’s

An interior Nash equilibrium of the contributions game exists if (4) and (5) are satisﬁed
when evaluated at the pair (HiN > 0, HcN > 0).
3.1. Symmetric candidates
While an interior Nash equilibrium need not exist, we can show that
14

Suﬃcient conditions are provided in the Appendix.

10

Proposition 1 A symmetric interior Nash equilibrium always exists when the candidates are symmetric and there are no ﬁxed costs of campaigning and no exogenous
campaign eﬀort.
For contested races, we are also interested in how one candidate responds to a change
in contributions by the rival candidate. Does an increase in the rival’s contributions lead
the competing candidate to accept more or less contributions? We can show that
Proposition 2 When the candidates are symmetric and there are no ﬁxed costs of campaigning and no exogenous campaign eﬀort, the candidates’ contributions are strategic
complements near the symmetric Nash equilibrium.

contributions to restore the ﬁrst order condition. The best response functions are thus
upward sloping in Hc –Hi space.
3.2. Comparative statics
Fixed costs
Candidates are likely have diﬀerent ﬁxed costs of campaigning. This will aﬀect the
number of contributions that each accepts. Speciﬁcally, a rise in Kj , j = i, c changes
the interior equilibrium (Hi , Hc ) according to

In other words, starting from the symmetric equilibrium an increase in ﬁxed costs
leads to more contributions by both candidates.
Changes in the ﬁxed cost of campaigning also has a direct eﬀect on candidate utility.
In particular,
Proposition 4 Near the symmetric Nash equilibrium, an increase in (own) ﬁxed cost
lowers a candidate’s utility and raises the utility of the rival candidate.
Cost of access
Suppose that the incumbent is more eﬃcient at providing access, perhaps reﬂecting the
advantage of experience or innate capacity, e.g., Γ (H) > Ω (H). This asymmetry acts
to increase Hi relative to Hc by shifting up the incumbent’s best response function.
Intuitively, the incumbent can anticipate less marginal eﬀort in providing access, hence
is able to accept more contributions, other things held equal. Strategic complementarity
implies that the challenger must then also supply more access in equilibrium.
15

The conditions which guarantee strategic complementarity also imply stability.

12

Recognition
The incumbent plausibly has a built-in advantage in that µ > 1/2 due to voters’ familiarity or campaign experience. Raising µ translates to a parametric rise in P (·). This
has an ambiguous eﬀect on the reaction functions and hence contribution levels. In the
region where P (·) is greater than or equal to 1/2, the eﬀect is to lower the incumbent’s
contribution level while it may raise or lower the challenger’s contribution level. In the
region where P (·) is less than 1/2, the eﬀect is to raise the challenger’s contribution
level while the eﬀect on the incumbent is ambiguous.
Value of access
A rise in the value of access can be parameterized as a multiplicative shift upward in
v(H). Such a shift has no eﬀect on the elasticity given H, and is readily seen to increase
the marginal beneﬁt of contributions in both ﬁrst order conditions. Thus the Nash
equilibrium number (and dollar amount) of contributions will rise for both challenger
and incumbent.

4. Corner Solution Nash Equilibria
Interior Nash equilibrium will not exist when candidates are suﬃciently asymmetric. In
these cases, the dominant candidate is the only active campaigner and Nash equilibrium
is found at one corner (i.e., either Hc = 0 or Hi = 0). A candidate will refrain from
active campaigning if she earns less utility in the interior Nash equilibrium than the
reservation utility she receives by not actively campaigning.
The corner solution is more likely the more asymmetric are the candidates. For
instance, the larger are the challenger’s ﬁxed costs relative to the incumbent’s ﬁxed

13

Even if an interior Nash equilibrium exists, there may be corner solution equilibria,
in which either the challenger or the incumbent does not actively campaign. These
arise, oversimplifying, when the electorate thinks one or the other politician has little
chance. Because the value of access depends on the probability of election, a politician
may be able to sell access, but will realize very little money from these sales and hence
will be unable to aﬀord to campaign. As a result, the electorate’s original assessment
that the candidate has a slim chance is self-fulﬁlling. As we discuss below, this view
is oversimpliﬁed because a politician who does raise campaign funds may still have a
chance of winning due to the presence of exogenous eﬀort.
More formally, if predetermined (or party) support is suﬃciently small so that ej −
Kj < 0, j = i, c, there always exists a pair of self-fulﬁlling prophecy corner solutions. In
this case, in order to begin to improve her chances of election a candidate must make a
discrete leap to a level of contributions suﬃcient to oﬀset this ﬁxed cost. Each potential
donor may not believe a suﬃcient number of others will support the candidate, so a
coordination failure among the donors and the politician will prevent entry. Thus, a
Nash equilibrium will exist at either corner. However, a corner solution will not be a
‘global’ Nash equilibrium if an interior solution also exists. In this case, the interior
solution dominates for the excluded candidate and the corner solution dominates for
the other candidate.16
16

When both interior and corner solutions exist, we prefer to think of the corner solution as a ‘local’

14

We note that the self-fulﬁlling prophecy corner solution may not exist. Fixed costs
and exogenous eﬀort are the two key ingredients in determining whether these corner
equilibria exist. If predetermined (or party) support is large relative to ﬁxed costs,
ej − Kj > 0, j = i, c, the politician will be viable so that even a small number of
sales of access are worthwhile to both the candidate and the lobbies. In this case,
the initial beliefs of the electorate do not determine the outcome and we will have an
interior equilibrium. For instance, a wealthy candidate may be able to “self-ﬁnance”
her campaign (i.e., has a very large e) and therefore have a very good chance despite
selling no access.
The preceding discussion has analytically characterized the equilibria in a generalized Baron model of campaign access. We have shown that interior equilibria exist
when the candidates are not too diﬀerent and that such equilibria may disappear when
we allow the candidates to diﬀer. Therefore, this generalization is potentially a much
more satisfying characterization of campaign competition since many races are essentially uncontested. While our discussion emphasized the importance of ﬁxed costs in
determining whether or not a race is contested, intuitively it is clear that any asymmetries will make corner solutions more likely. Qualitative analysis cannot, however,
quantify the likelihood of observing corner solutions.

5. Simulation Results
We now use simulation techniques to show how asymmetries can create uncontested
campaigns and to quantify how diﬀerent the candidates must be before interior solutions
disappear (i.e., before races become uncontested). Our answer is, not much. We also
Nash equilibrium since moving from the corner implies non-myopic behavior on the part of the lobbies
as well as the politicians.

investigate how ﬁxed costs interact with small asymmetries to make interior solutions
disappear. Relatively small ﬁxed costs make for corner solutions. Overall, the results
indicate that the Baron model with ﬁxed costs is quite plausibly an explanation of a
the large proportion of corner solutions.
In order to simulate the model, we write the value of access as
v(Hj ) = v0 Hj α , j = i, c; −1 < α < 0.

We also suppose that the cost of providing access can be written as
Ω(Hi ) = Hi δi , δi > 1,
Γ(Hc ) = Hc δc , δc > 1.

Substituting, we can solve for campaign eﬀort as
pπv0 Hi α+1 − Ki
+ e¯i
bi
(1 − p)πv0 Hc α+1 − Kc
= max 0,
+ e¯c .
bc

ei = max 0,
ec

As discussed above, the key determinant for whether both candidates actively sell access
is the relative size of exogenous eﬀort and ﬁxed costs. It is convenient, therefore, for us
to normalize exogenous eﬀort to zero and measure ﬁxed costs relative to ei = ec = 0.
The size of ﬁxed costs is to be understood in our simulations relative to the value of
oﬃce W , the value of access parameters v0 and α, and the cost of access parameter, δ.
For this purpose it is very useful to focus on the minimum value of contributions H min
needed to obtain positive eﬀort, and on the utility enjoyed at that minimum level of

16

contributions. For the incumbent, for a given probability of election p, we have

pπv0

1/(1+α)
.

The expected utility of the incumbent at H min is

p W−

Ki
pπv0

δi /(1+α) 
.

Assuming a reservation utility of zero, if expected utility is less than or equal to zero at
H min , entry is impossible. Solving for the value of Ki which just makes expected utility
equal to zero, we have Kimax = pπv0 W (1+α)/δi .
In simulating the model we chose parameter values in part so that the ﬁxed costs
are small in the sense that Ki /Kimax is small.17 If ﬁxed costs are close to Kimax and
Kc > Ki , then it is very diﬃcult for the challenger to be considered viable, even if
the candidates are symmetric in all other respects. Hence, the challenger will have
a very diﬃcult time raising money. We believe this is not a particularly compelling
scenario since the explanation for uncontested races would simply be large ﬁxed costs.
In contrast, when the incumbent’s ﬁxed costs are small, the mere presence of ﬁxed costs
does not obviously give rise to uncontested races.
In the simulations presented below, we assume that candidates are symmetric in
most respects. For instance, we assume they are similar in their ability to provide
access (i.e., δi = δc = 2) and in their marginal cost of campaign eﬀort (i.e., bi = bc = 1).
We also assume β = 0.5, π = 0.3, and the value of being elected is W = 10, 000. Finally,
we assume that the value of access without any congestion from other buyers is v0 = 70.
In our simulations we characterize whether the campaign is contested as the other
17

Similar methods characterize what it means for Kc to be small.

17

key parameters in the model vary. We consider two alternative values for the elasticity
of the value of access, α = {−0.7, −0.9} and two sizes of the incumbent’s ﬁxed costs,
Ki = {1, 3}. Given this parameterization the smallest value of Kimax implied is 21p100.2 ,
which implies that the largest value of Ki /Kimax used in our simulations is equal to 0.09p.
This is a deliberately extreme small value for the incumbent’s ﬁxed costs, one which
gives a deliberately large share of the parameter space in which contested races can
emerge in equilibrium.18
In Figures 1 and 2 we depict our simulation results. On the x-axis we measure the
candidates relative ex ante prospects. As will become clear, it is convenient to normalize
the metric as ω = (1 − µ)/µ. Without loss of generality we assume that µ ≥ 1/2.19
When the two candidates have the same ex ante probability of winning (i.e., µ = 1/2),
ω = 1. As the incumbent is increasingly favored by the electorate, (i.e., µ increases), ω
falls. In the limit, when the incumbent is guaranteed a victory (µ = 1), ω = 0. Thus,
the ω should be interpreted as a measure of the challenger’s initial prospects.
On the y-axis we measure the relative ﬁxed costs, κ = Ki /Kc . It is reasonable to
assume that the challenger has at least as large ﬁxed costs as the incumbent, Kc ≥ Ki .
As the challenger is burdened with larger and larger ﬁxed costs κ falls. Thus, in the
ﬁgures at the point (ω = 1, κ = 1) the candidates are completely symmetric. As we
move to the southwest the candidates become increasingly dissimilar or asymmetric.
In each of the ﬁgures we report whether in our simulations the race is contested.
For each set of parameter values we plot a line that divides the box into two subspaces.
The region above the plotted line contains parameter values which support a contested
18

If the equilibrium probability for contested races is around 1/2, the ratio Ki /Kimax < 1/5. In other
words, the largest ﬁxed costs considered in our simulations is less than one-ﬁfth of the value which
would preclude entry.
19
It seems sensible that at the time the campaign begins the incumbent would be as least as likely to
win as the challenger.

18

equilibrium. The region below contains parameter values for which only corner solutions
exist.
We begin by looking at Figure 1 where we set Ki = 1. In the ﬁgure we contrast the
solutions for two diﬀerent values of α, the elasticity of the value of access, which is best
interpreted as a congestion externality. In other words, the value of access to a given
lobby decreases as in the number of lobbies seeking access.
The ﬁgure highlights several key insights. First, the more similar are the candidates,
the more likely will races be contested. That is, for parameter values in northeast region
(i.e., high ω and high κ), races are contested. For parameter values in southwest region
(i.e., low ω and low κ), races are uncontested. This is consistent with the empirical
ﬁnding the uncontested races tend to occur in the same House district year after year
where a popular incumbent runs year after year; conversely, landslide victories rarely
occur in open seat races, where the candidates are far more likely to be viewed as ex
ante similar by the electorate (Gierzynski, 2000).
Second, for a given value of relative ﬁxed costs, races are more likely to be uncontested the larger is the incumbent’s ex ante advantage (i.e., the higher is µ). When
relative ﬁxed costs are suﬃciently diﬀerent, even races where the candidates have identical ex ante prospects (µ = 1/2 or ω = 1) are uncontested. Conversely, for a given value
of µ, races are more likely to uncontested the larger are challenger’s ﬁxed costs. And,
when the incumbent is suﬃciently favored (µ is large), even races where the candidates
have identical ﬁxed costs are uncontested
Third, as we vary the parameter characterizing the elasticity of the value of access,
the likelihood of contested races changes. In the ﬁgure we depict two values for the
elasticity, one where the congestion externality is relatively low (α = −0.7) and one
where the congestion externality is relatively high (α = −0.9). We ﬁnd that the higher
19

the congestion eﬀect, the more diﬃcult it will be for the challenger to raise funds.
The reason: a high congestion externality reduces the value to contributing. This
exacerbates the incumbent’s advantages of relatively low ﬁxed costs and high initial
favorability. As a result, the challenger ﬁnds herself unable to raise funds. In our
example, the fraction of parameter space involving uncontested races jumps from 28%
to 54% when the congestion externality increases. Of course, the exact percentage of
uncontested races depends on the precise parameter values, but the lesson is clear: the
role of ﬁxed costs is magniﬁed when the candidates diﬀer in other dimensions. And,
this means our variant of the Baron model can plausibly explain the high frequency of
uncontested House and Senate races.
Figure 2 highlights that the level of ﬁxed costs, not just their relative magnitudes,
inﬂuence the type of outcomes observed. In this ﬁgure we hold the congestion externality
constant (α = −0.7) but we now let the size of the incumbent’s ﬁxed cost be either low
(Ki = 1) or higher (Ki = 3).20 On the y-axis we continue to depict the candidates’
relative ﬁxed costs, κ, and assume that the challenger has at least as large ﬁxed costs
as the incumbent.
Once again, the model generates predictions that are consistent with empirical ﬁndings. First, just as we saw in Figure 1, the more similar are the candidates, the more
likely will the races be contested. In other words, parameter values in the northeast
region give rise to contested races while those in the southwest give rise to uncontested
races. Second, diﬀerences between the candidates become increasingly important the
higher are ﬁxed costs. In particular, for a given κ, the lower are the incumbent’s ﬁxed
costs the larger µ must be before a race is uncontested. In simple terms, the lower are
ﬁxed costs, the more likely will races be contested. In our simulation, the fraction of
20

We once again emphasize that Ki = 3 is still small relative to W and v0 .

20

parameter space involving uncontested races goes from 28% to 55% when ﬁxed costs
increase. We emphasize that even the higher value of ﬁxed costs is ‘small’ relative to
the value of oﬃce and the revenue of the ﬁrst units of access sold. Or, put another
way, the expected utility at the minimum level of H is large so it is not unreasonable
to expect challengers to contest the race. Nonetheless, the simulations reveal that even
small ﬁxed costs can generate uncontested races.
Taking Figure 1 and 2 together, the simulations conﬁrm that a generalization of the
Baron model of electoral competition can generate competition patterns consistent with
the empirical observation that a large number of campaign races are uncontested.

6. Concluding Comments
In this paper we oﬀer a generalization of Baron’s (1989) model of electoral competition.
By introducing ﬁxed costs and exogenous campaign eﬀort, we show that a Baron-type
formulation can generate predictions consistent with observed patterns of electoral competition: namely, only one candidate reports signiﬁcant PAC contributions in many
House and Senate races.
The ﬁxed cost of campaigning allows a role for strategic play in two dimensions.
First, the expenditure of initial funds (or what we refer to as exogenous eﬀort) raises
the perceived probability of reelection and hence the price at which access may be sold
subsequently to PACs. It thus confers an advantage in the subsequent contributions
competition with a rival. Second, there is the war chest eﬀect: strategic accumulation of campaign contributions to deter entry of serious challengers. Third, party-level
contributions can potentially serve to stimulate PAC contributions. That is, party contributions can make a weak candidate viable, and by doing so “prime the pump” so that

21

non-party PACs ﬁnd it worthwhile to contribute. In a companion paper (Anderson and
Prusa, 2001) we analyze these issues in greater detail.

Appendix
The Reduced Form Probability Function
The model implies that the probability depends on eﬀort, while eﬀort depends on
the probability. Further analysis requires a reduced form solution for the probability in
terms of (Hi , Hc , Ki , Kc ).
Using the expressions for (1), (2), and (3), total candidate eﬀort is given by:

ei =

ec =




ei + [pπv(Hi )Hi − Ki ]/bi

if pπv(Hi )Hi − Ki ≥ 0,



ei
otherwise.



ec + [(1 − p)πv(Hc )Hc − Kc ]/bc if (1 − p)πv(Hc )Hc − Kc ≥ 0,


ec

otherwise.

For an interior solution, we can obtain the reduced form by dividing the numerator
and denominator of (1) by µeβi and substituting eﬀort levels. The rational expectations
equilibrium condition is



p = g(p, Hi , Hc , Ki , Kc ) =
1+ω

(A.1)

. The reduced form probability function is

P (Hi , Hc , Ki , Kc ) = {p : p = g(p, Hi , Hc , Ki , Kc )} .

Existence and Uniqueness of the Equilibrium Probability
Existence of the ﬁxed point solution of the equation deﬁning P (·) can be guaranteed

25

but uniqueness obtains only with restrictions. As for existence, so long as at least one
candidate campaigns actively we show that 1 > g(1, ·) > g(0, ·) > 0. Since g(p, ·) is
continuous on the unit interval, it must cross the 45 degree line satisfying p = g(p, ·)
somewhere in the unit interval, hence a ﬁxed point exists.
There is a technical complication in the positive eﬀort requirement. To simplify
notation deﬁne p = Ki /[v(Hi )Hi ], p = 1 − Kc /[v(Hc )Hc ].
For Hi and Hc both small (i.e., pπv(Hi )Hi − Ki ≤ 0 and (1 − p)πv(Hc )Hc − Kc ≤ 0),
neither campaign is active and
g(p, Hi , Hc , Ki , Kc ) = 1/[1 + ω (bc ec /bi ei )β ]

for all p.

(A.2)

For Hc small we have

g(p, Hi , Hc , Ki , Kc ) =




1/[1 + ω (ec /ei )β ]

if p ≤ p,



1/[1 + ω (ec /ei )β ]

otherwise.

For Hc and Hi both suﬃciently large we have




1/[1 + ω(ec /ei )β ]




g(p, Hi , Hc , Ki , Kc ) =
1/[1 + ω(ec /ei )β ]






1/[1 + ω(ec /ei )β ]

if p ≤ p,
if p < p < p,
if p > p.

It is straightforward to show that 1 > g(1) > g(p) > g(p) > g(0) > 0 and g(p) is
continuous on the unit interval, as claimed.
The ﬁxed point solution p need not be unique. Uniqueness follows if gp < 1 for
26

p ∈ [0, 1]. Diﬀerentiating g(p, ·) in the interval p < p < p
gp (p, ·) = βg(1 − g) (Ac + Ac ) ≥ 0,

where
Ac ≡
Ai ≡

v(Hc )Hc
≥0
bc ec + (1 − p)v(Hc )Hc − Kc
v(Hi )Hi
≥ 0.
bi ei + pv(Hi )Hi − Ki

For p < p, Ac disappears and for p > p, Ai disappears. Examining the expression
for gp , uniqueness cannot generally be guaranteed, since Ac + Ai can exceed one by
enough to oﬀset the inﬂuence of the ﬁrst three terms. For large v(Hc )Hc and v(Hi )Hi ,
at equilibrium p = g, gp and converges to β. As v(Hc )Hc and v(Hi )Hi fall, their eﬀect
on gp is signed by
∂Ac
∂Hc
∂Ai
∂Hi

bc ec − Kc
(1 − 1/εc )
Hc [bc ec + (1 − p)v(Hc )Hc − Kc ]
bi ei − Ki
(1 − 1/εi ),
= Ai
Hi [bi ei + pv(Hi )Hi − Ki ]
= Ac

where the elasticities are deﬁned as
εi ≡ −v(Hi )/[v  (Hi )Hi ] > 1
εc ≡ −v(Hc )/[v  (Hc )Hc ] > 1
Ac + Ai falls with contributions as bi ei − Ki > 0 and bc ec − Kc > 0. Ac + Ai rises
with contributions as bi ei − Ki < 0 and bc ec − Kc < 0.

27

Therefore a suﬃcient condition for uniqueness is β < 1, bi ei −Ki > 0 and bc ec −Kc >
0.
Comparative Statics of the Probability Function
We now consider the comparative statics of the equilibrium probability P (Hi , Hc , Ki , Kc ).
We will show that the incumbent’s probability is increasing in her own contributions
and decreasing in the rival’s contributions, assuming the uniqueness condition discussed
above is satisﬁed.
Diﬀerentiating P (·) with respect to Hi ,

PHi =

gHi
> 0,
1 − gp

where
gHi = βg(1 − g)

pv(Hi )(1 − 1/εi )
> 0.
bi ei + pv(Hi )Hi − Ki

The denominator is positive while the numerator is positive for the portion of the inverse
demand curve for which revenue is increasing in sales.
Diﬀerentiating P (·) with respect to Hc ,

PHc =

gHc
<0
1 − gp

since
gHc = −βg(1 − g)

(1 − p)v(Hc )(1 − 1/εc )
< 0.
bc ec + (1 − p)v(Hc )Hc − Kc

As for the ﬁxed costs, we anticipate that the incumbent’s probability is decreasing
in her own ﬁxed costs and increasing in rival’s ﬁxed costs. The ﬁxed costs aﬀect P (·)

28

as follows
gKi

bc ec + (1 − p)πv(Hc )Hc − Kc

The second derivatives of the reduced form probability function are needed to evaluate the comparative statics of the Nash equilibrium in the contributions game. From
the analysis of the Nash game interior solution we know that PHi Ki > 0 is a suﬃcient
condition for a rise in Ki to shift the incumbent’s oﬀer of Hi upward for any value of Hc ,
i.e., dHi /dKi > 0 while maintaining the marginal proﬁt condition for the incumbent.

The conditions given suﬃce to sign all terms but gpp . The ﬁrst term of the square
bracketed expression in gpp is negative for g > 1/2. The second term is ambiguous.
Hereafter we will assume that gpp < 0.
Taking all the second derivative expressions and using the ﬁrst derivative signs we
have shown

PHi Ki > 0, for g > 1/2, gp < 1, gpp < 0, ei − Ki < 0.
The condition g ≥ 1/2 basically requires that the incumbent have an advantage. The
30

other conditions are merely technical.
It can similarly be shown that
PHc Ki < 0, for g > 1/2, gp < 1, gpp < 0, ec − Kc > 0.
These technical conditions are over-suﬃcient for the economically intuitive signs on
the second derivatives of the reduced form probability function. The conditions imply
that the marginal eﬀect of own eﬀort on election probability is increasing in own ﬁxed
cost and in rival’s ﬁxed cost (recalling that 1−P is the challenger’s election probability).
The intuition comes from (A.1).
A rise in own ﬁxed cost lowers own eﬀort, all else equal, and for β < 1, the marginal
eﬀect of own eﬀort on election probability is decreasing in own eﬀort, pei ei < 0. Thus a
rise in own ﬁxed cost raises the marginal eﬀect of own eﬀort on election probability. The
rise in rival’s ﬁxed cost lowers the rival’s eﬀort, all else equal. With p ≥ 1/2, pei ec > 0,
implying that the marginal beneﬁt of own eﬀort is lowered by a rise in rival’s ﬁxed cost.
Existence of interior Nash equilibrium—Symmetric candidates
With symmetric candidates and zero ﬁxed costs an interior Nash equilibrium always
exists. Existence is proved by showing that the ﬁrst order conditions are satisﬁed at
Hi = Hc ,

With symmetric candidates, the access cost function and the campaign cost function are
common, so Ω(H) = Γ(H). At the symmetric equilibrium, p = P (·) = g(·) = 1/2 and

31

PHi = −PHc based the properties of P (·) developed earlier in the Appendix. Therefore
the equations are indeed satisﬁed at Hi = Hc . There is no guarantee, however, that the
symmetric equilibrium is unique even with common access and campaign cost functions.

Drawing on the derivations earlier in the Appendix we know that at the symmetric
equilibrium we know that PHi Hc = 0 if g = 1/2 and bj ej − Kj = 0, j = i, c. Strategic
complementarity follows directly in this case.
However, these conditions are clearly over-suﬃcient. Recall that all second derivatives of g have terms in 1 − 2g, so near the symmetric equilibrium PHi Hc is close to
zero. Therefore, near a symmetric equilibrium the second term will dominate and the
contributions will be strategic complements.

intuitive case—a rise in the incumbent’s ﬁxed cost shifts the incumbent’s best response
function upward, does not shift the challenger’s best response function by much, and
thus induces both candidates to work harder. There is, however, a subtlety created by
the dependence of p on eﬀort while eﬀort depends on p. The reduced form structure
of P implies that the challenger’s best response function is also shifted by the rise in
incumbent ﬁxed cost and this can turn out to lower the challenger’s equilibrium Hc .
