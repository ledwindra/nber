Riding the Bubble? Chasing Returns into Illiquid Assets
Danny Yagan
NBER Working Paper No. 20360
July 2014
JEL No. G0,H0
ABSTRACT
Household investors chase stock market returns. Surveys suggest that households intend to "ride the
bubble" by buying stocks early in a boom and selling stocks early in a bust. This implies that households
use only liquid assets to chase returns. I test this prediction using inflows to fixed annuities---illiquid
tax-preferred assets that lock wealth out of the stock market for five to ten years. I find that fixed annuity
inflows spike after poor stock market returns, inconsistent with ride-the-bubble intentions and instead
indicating buy-and-hold intentions. The results are consistent with households extrapolating recent
stock market returns into the long run.

Introduction

Household (non-institutional) investors reallocate wealth to stocks after stock prices rise: Figure
1 displays this well-known e¤ect of recent stock market returns on net in‡ows to equity mutual
funds. Such “return chasing” by household investors is a robust empirical phenomenon (Ippolito
1992; Chevalier and Ellison 1997; Sirri and Tufano 1998; Teo and Woo 2004; Frazzini and Lamont
2008; Choi, Laibson, Madrian, and Metrick 2009; Chiang, Hirshleifer, Qian, and Sherman 2011) and
underlies a class of models seeking to explain asset pricing anomalies (DeLong, Shleifer, Summers,
and Waldman 1990; Hong and Stein 1999; Barberis and Shleifer 2003; Barberis, Greenwood, Jin,
and Shleifer forthcoming). This paper investigates why households chase stock market returns.
When asked, households report expectations consistent with a “ride the bubble” strategy of
buying stocks at the beginning of a market rally and selling stocks at the beginning of a market
decline, also called “greater fool” and “buy low, sell high” strategies (Harrison and Kreps 1978;
Frankel and Froot 1990; Lamont and Thaler 2003). Speci…cally, household investors report expectations of short-run stock market momentum (Amromin and Sharpe 2014; Greenwood and Shleifer
2014) and medium-run reversals, suggesting that households believe they can beat the market by
timing their exit and entry (Vissing-Jorgensen 2003). For example, the Yale Stock Market Con…dence Index survey (2014) …nds that near the end of the late-1990s market rally, half or more of
household investors stated that stock prices exceeded fundamental value but that prices would nevertheless rise over the next year.1 Similarly, UBS/Gallup surveys show that household investors’
stated expectations of the one-year stock market return declined ten percentage points between
2000 and 2003 while stated expectations of the annualized ten-year return declined only two per1

In April 2000, 72% responded “Too high” to the question: “Stock prices in the United States, when compared
with measures of true fundamental value or sensible investment value, are (a) Too low, (b) Too high, (c) About
right, (d) Do not know.” In the same survey, 76% responded with a positive number to: “How much of a change
in percentage terms do you expect in the Dow Jones Industrial Average over the next 1 year?” Thus at least 48%
believed stocks were overpriced but that prices would nevertheless rise in the next year.

centage points (Vissing-Jorgensen); short-run momentum combined with long-run stability implies
medium-run reversals.
If household investors chase returns in order to bene…t from temporary stock market rallies
and to avoid temporary declines (“ride-the-bubble intentions”), they will not chase returns into
illiquid assets that lock owners into a speci…c equity position for several years at a time.

I test

this prediction using the time series of in‡ows to U.S. annuities. Annuities in the United States
are sold by life insurers but are not annuities in the traditional economic sense: only 3% of the
$2.5 trillion of U.S. annuity assets are annuitized into lifetime income streams. Instead, annuities
are tax-preferred savings vehicles into which households nearing retirement make large one-time
contributions; 10.5% of Americans over sixty years old have an annuity. Households choose either
a …xed (…xed-return) annuity or a variable (equity-linked) annuity at the time of contribution and
face substantial early withdrawal fees until the pre-speci…ed maturity of typically …ve to ten years.
Households can costlessly reallocate balances across asset classes within variable annuities but not
within …xed annuities. Hence, a rise in aggregate …xed annuity in‡ows re‡ects households locking
additional wealth out of the stock market for several years at a time.2
This paper uses quarterly data on aggregate …xed annuity in‡ows from 1986 to 2006 to test
whether past S&P returns negatively a¤ect …xed annuity in‡ows, inconsistent with ride-the-bubble
intentions and consistent instead with buy-and-hold intentions. I …nd that past S&P returns have
a large negative e¤ect on …xed annuity in‡ows: one-standard-deviation-lower S&P returns last year,
two years ago, three years ago, and four years ago reduce the current quarter’s …xed annuity in‡ows
by 17%, 13%, 9%, and 5%, respectively, amounting to an annual reduction of $32 billion on a base
of $72 billion. In fact, lagged S&P returns explain most of the time series variation in …xed annuity
in‡ows. This e¤ect is not an overall annuity e¤ect: S&P returns have a similarly strong negative

Though housing is also illiquid, households are on both sides of the vast majority of home sales, whereas institutional investors are often on the other side of the bond sales underlying new …xed annuities.

e¤ect on the …xed annuity share of total (…xed plus variable) annuity in‡ows and a similarly strong
positive e¤ect on variable annuity in‡ows. I conclude that household investors chase returns even
into …xed annuities, in spite of their illiquidity and inconsistent with ride-the-bubble intentions.
This basic …nding could in principle be limitedly consequential if households use their nonannuity …nancial assets to o¤set their …xed annuity allocations, leaving their overall equity exposures
unchanged. Turning to the 2007-2009 Survey of Consumer Finances panel, I …nd no such o¤set: the
average new …xed annuity investor between 2007 and 2009 placed 33% of her household’s …nancial
assets into annuities and reduced her household’s equity share of …nancial assets by 30 percentage
points.

This large reduction in equity exposure is unique to new …xed annuity investors: new

variable annuity investors of the same age, 2007 wealth, and 2007 equity exposure instead increased
their overall equity exposure over the same period. Hence, the household decision to invest in a
…xed annuity is associated with a large reduction in the household’s overall equity exposure.
In a …nal descriptive exercise that quanti…es one candidate explanation of the results, I use the
time series of …xed annuity in‡ows to parameterize a reduced-form model of expectation formation.
Under the strong assumption that household demand for …xed annuities is a¢ ne in the expected
long-run equity premium akin to the a¢ ne portfolio rules in Kim and Omberg (1996) and Campbell
and Viceira (1999), the sensitivity of …xed annuity in‡ows to lagged S&P returns implies that the
average annuity investor behaves as if she raises her expectation of the long-run equity return by
6.6%, 5.1%, 3.7%, and 2.0% of the …rst-through-fourth S&P lags. Such long-run extrapolation of
recent stock market returns would accord with households’choices for …nancial advice during stock
market rallies and would imply large revisions over time in expectations of the long-run equity
return, including an 8.7-percentage-point reduction from 1999 to 2003.3
3

I stress, however, that

The books The Roaring 2000s: Building the Wealth and Lifestyle You Desire in the Greatest Boom in History
(Dent 1998) and Dow 36,000: The New Strategy of Pro…ting from the Coming Rise in the Stock Market (Glassman
and Hassett 1999) predicted that stock prices would continue to climb toward very large fundamental values and were
New York Times and Business Week bestsellers through early 2000.

time variation in expected returns, risk aversion (e.g. due to wealth changes), and discount factors
could each have driven the observed variation in …xed annuity in‡ows and are equivalent in standard
models. Regardless of the underlying source, return chasing into illiquid assets is inconsistent with
ride-the-bubble intentions.
This paper connects to several strands in the literature. An in‡uential set of papers documents
return chasing into liquid …nancial assets. Ippolito (1992), Chevalier and Ellison (1997), Sirri and
Tufano (1998), Teo and Woo (2004), and Frazzini and Lamont (2008) document strong e¤ects of
mutual fund past performance on subsequent fund in‡ows. Choi, Laibson, Madrian, and Metrick
(2009) show that household investors chase their own historical 401(k) returns when choosing their
401(k) savings rates, and Chiang, Hirshleifer, Qian, and Sherman (2011) show that household
investors chase their own historical IPO returns when choosing whether to bid on subsequent
IPOs.4 Greenwood and Nagel (2009) demonstrate similar return chasing by inexperienced mutual
fund managers.

Schultz (2003), Baker and Wurgler (2006), and Dong, Hirshleifer, and Teoh

(2012) present evidence consistent with …rms taking advantage of return chasers by issuing stock
at temporary stock price peaks.
This paper contributes to this literature by using ‡ows into a prominent illiquid …nancial asset—
…xed annuities— to investigate the motives underlying return chasing. The …nding that household
investors chase stock market returns into illiquid assets indicates that return chasing is not just
driven by intentions to ride a temporary bubble.

Instead, recent stock market returns strongly

a¤ect household decisions to lock wealth out of the stock market for several years at a time.
Though Americans rarely annuitize wealth into …xed lifetime income streams (Modigliani 1986;
Brown 2009), my analysis is most closely related to contemporaneous work by Previtero (2014)
who shows that poor recent stock market returns increase annuitization rates. He notes that poor

The exception in this literature is that the reverse pattern is observed among individual securities already owned
by the household investor (Shefrin and Statman 1985; Odean 1998).

stock market returns also seem to increase …xed annuity in‡ows, but his paper is not fundamentally
concerned with testing return-chasing motives, does not evaluate alternative explanations using
variable annuity in‡ows, and does not test for o¤setting allocations at the household level.
A similarly large theoretical literature considers the implications of trend extrapolation on
asset prices. Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998); Fuster, Hebert, and Laibson (2011), Hirshleifer
and Yu (2013), and Alti and Tetlock (2014) model asset prices when some investors extrapolate
trends in fundamentals. Cutler, Poterba, and Summers (1990), DeLong, Shleifer, Summers, and
Waldman (1990), Hong and Stein (1999), Barberis and Shleifer (2003), and Barberis, Greenwood,
Jin, and Shleifer (forthcoming) allow for a class of investors who extrapolate returns. In addition
to providing new evidence of household return chasing, this paper motivates a distinction between
investors who extrapolate returns only into the short run and those who extrapolate returns into
the long run, with potential implications for liquidity premia.
The results provide a mixed view of the reliability of household investors’stated expectations.
Recent stock market returns have a large e¤ect on households’reported expectations of the one-year
stock market return (Amromin and Sharpe 2014; Greenwood and Shleifer 2014) but a small e¤ect
on reported expectations of the ten-year market return (Vissing-Jorgensen 2003). Yet the return
chasing estimated in this paper is consistent with a large e¤ect of recent market returns on expected
long-run market returns as well, raising the possibility that households misreport their long-run
expectations, in line with earlier skepticism (Campbell 2003; Lamont 2003; Cochrane 2011).5
Finally, a small but growing literature asks what incentives (Du‡o, Gale, Liebman, Orszag, and
Saez 2006), defaults (Carroll, Choi, Laibson, Madrian, and Metrick 2009), and other interventions
like information provision (Lusardi and Mitchell 2011) may reduce the welfare costs of apparent
investment mistakes (Campbell 2006).

This

raises the possibility that subsidizing small annual retirement contributions (as in 401(k) accounts
and Individual Retirement Accounts) generates more balanced household portfolios over time than

robustness.

Section VI documents the relevance of annuity investments for household portfolio

allocations. Section VII provides an interpretation of the results. Section VIII concludes.

Institutional Background on U.S. Annuities

I test for return chasing into illiquid assets using quarterly in‡ows into U.S. annuities. Annuities in
the United States are not annuities in the traditional economic sense: Americans rarely annuitize
their retirement assets into lifetime income streams (Modigliani 1986; Brown 2009), and only $79
billion (3.1%) of the $2.45 trillion of U.S. annuity assets are annuitized into lifetime income streams
(LIMRA 2013). Rather, U.S. annuities are several-year investment vehicles that o¤er tax deferral
on investment income at the expense of substantial early withdrawal fees.

The pre-speci…ed

durations are typically …ve to ten years; shorter durations are rare because tax deferral yields little
value over short horizons.

Annuities must be provided by a life insurance company in order to

qualify for tax deferral and are not federally insured.6
Annuities share key features of 401(k) accounts and IRAs— tax deferral and a 10% federal
tax penalty on nominal earnings if distributions are made before age 59.5— but are inferior to
those other retirement accounts because annuity contributions are made with post-tax assets and
nominal earnings are subject to income tax upon withdrawal. Yet unlike these other retirement

accounts, there is no legal limit to annuity contributions, and, unlike 401(k)s and traditional IRAs in
particular, annuity withdrawals can be postponed inde…nitely.7 Annuities do not strictly dominate
brokerage accounts because of the tax penalties on withdrawals before age 59.5, because annuities
do not o¤er single-stock trading, because annuities typically require a minimum balance of $10,000
or more, and because annuity providers assess penalties for withdrawals before the preset duration.8
A typical annuity contract may assess a 7% surrender fee on the full amount of annual withdrawals,
with the fee decreasing by 1% until the seven-year maturity.9 Hence, withdrawals after only a year
or two are heavily penalized.
Annuities are therefore attractive investments for households that have maxed out their Individual Retirement Account (IRA) contribution limits and are willing to sacri…ce liquidity for higher
after-tax returns (Brown and Poterba 2006). Based on the 2007-2009 Survey of Consumer Finances
panel (introduced in the next section), 10.5% of U.S. households over age sixty hold assets in an
annuity, and the typical new annuity investor is at or near retirement age, has over $200,000 in
liquid …nancial wealth, and immediately places over $50,000 in the new annuity.10
Annuities are o¤ered in two broad varieties: …xed and variable.

A minority of annuity assets are held within IRAs, for example as an easy way to purchase a death bene…t rider.
Annuity income is taxed at ordinary income tax rates regardless of source, so variable annuities (de…ned below)
which generate dividends and capital gains can be particularly inferior to brokerage accounts when held for short
periods (Brown and Poterba 2006).

Some …xed annuities carry higher surrender fees with higher …xed returns. “Section 1035” exchanges of one
annuity contract for another are not considered withdrawals for tax purposes but are considered withdrawals for
surrender fee purposes. There is a secondary market for …xed annuities but it is small and carries high transaction
costs.

annuity assets cannot be reallocated to equities or converted into variable annuities. Hence, …xed
annuity in‡ows are a consistent measure of households allocating wealth away from equities for
several years at a time. In preferred speci…cations, I estimate the e¤ect of lagged S&P returns on
in‡ows to …xed annuities.
Finally, note that a unique subset of …xed annuities called indexed annuities o¤er limited equity
exposure but do not confound the results below. Indexed annuities o¤er investors a variable return
within a tight band; for example, a typical indexed annuity might o¤er a return of 0% if the S&P
declines in a given year, a return of 3.5% if the S&P returns more than 3.5%, and the actual S&P
return if the S&P returns between 0% and 3.5%. Indexed annuities were invented in the mid-1990s,
are classi…ed as …xed annuities in LIMRA data, and have grown from composing less than one-tenth
of …xed annuity in‡ows in 2001 to just under one-third in 2006. I obtained indexed annuity in‡ows
data for only a subset (quarters 2001-2006) of the time series used below; all qualitative results
below hold when subtracting indexed annuity in‡ows from …xed annuity in‡ows.12

Data

This paper uses three types of data: quarterly data on annuity in‡ows and terms, quarterly data
on the Standard & Poors 500 (S&P) price index, and the 2007-2009 Survey of Consumer Finances
panel. The sample frame, variable de…nitions, and summary statistics are as follows. All dollar
values are in‡ated to 2010 dollars using the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers; rates
of return are not adjusted for in‡ation.
12

Under the main speci…cation below (Table 2 column 4) using either the full sample or just the 2001-2006 period,
estimated e¤ects of lagged S&P returns on …xed annuity in‡ows are approximately 18% smaller when excluding
indexed annuity in‡ows.

III.A

Annuity In‡ows

This paper uses quarterly data on …xed annuity in‡ows, variable annuity in‡ows, and …xed annuity
terms for the 84 quarters encompassing years 1986 through 2006.

The data were compiled by

LIMRA (2008), the leading life insurance industry research group in the United States. LIMRA
obtains its data from surveys of life insurance companies.

It estimates that its surveys of sixty

annuity providers in 2007 covered 97% of the market.
Fixed annuity in‡ows equals the assets committed to new …xed annuity accounts.
annuity in‡ows equals the assets committed to new variable annuity accounts.
in‡ows equals …xed annuity in‡ows plus variable annuity in‡ows.

Variable

Total annuity

Out‡ows are not reported so

these in‡ows variables are not measured net of out‡ows; however, out‡ows are small due to the
substantial surrender costs. The …xed annual rate of return on new …xed annuities (“…xed rate”)
equals the …xed rate of return o¤ered on the typical new …xed annuity as reported by LIMRA.
Though LIMRA has compiled more recent statistics on annuity in‡ows, it stopped collecting …xed
rate information in 2006.

III.B

S&P Returns

The main analysis dataset comprises the quarterly annuity in‡ows data merged with lagged S&P
returns as published by Shiller (2014). For a given quarter q, the nth lagged S&P return equals the
percentage change between the average closing price of the S&P in the month preceding quarter
q 4(n 2) and quarter q 4(n 1). For example, consider the S&P lags for the …rst quarter of year
2000. The …rst S&P lag equals the percentage di¤erence between the average S&P closing price
in December 1998 and the average closing price in December 1999. The second S&P lag equals
the percentage di¤erence between the average S&P closing price in December 1997 and the average
closing price in December 1998. Etcetera. The main speci…cation utilizes the …rst-through-fourth

9

S&P lags.

III.C

2007-2009 Survey of Consumer Finances Panel

For supplemental household-level analyses of new annuity investors, I use data on new annuity
investors from the 2007-2009 Survey of Consumer Finances panel.

The Surveys of Consumer

Finances are triennial surveys of randomly selected American households, strati…ed by income in
order to over-sample the wealthy. These surveys are typically repeated cross sections, but in order
to study the e¤ects of the recent …nancial crisis, in 2009 the Federal Reserve Board sponsored a
special re-interview of the 2007 survey respondents. Eighty-nine percent (3,862) of eligible 2007
respondents completed the 2009 re-interview.13 I utilize the resulting public-use panel and weight
observations by their sampling probability in all analyses.
I de…ne new annuity investors as households that held no assets in annuities in 2007 but held
positive assets in annuities in 2009. I de…ne new …xed annuity investors as new annuity investors
whose annuity assets have no exposure to stocks; I de…ne all other new annuity investors as new
variable annuity investors.

Financial assets equals the sum of balances across the household’s

annuity, checking, savings, 401(k), individual retirement, Keogh, brokerage, and revocable trust
accounts.

The equity share of …nancial assets equals the share of …nancial assets invested in

stocks.14 Age refers to the age of the member of the household who completed the survey.

Summary Statistics

Figure 2a displays the time series of total annuity in‡ows. Consistent with large rises over time
in stock market participation rates and democratization of various …nancial instruments,15 total
13
Approximately 2% of the 2007 respondents were ineligible for a re-interview because both the respondent and
the spouse (if applicable) had died or left the United States. The 2007 SCF enjoyed an overall response rate of 51%,
broadly in line with previous versions of the SCF (Kennickell 2010).
14
When respondents report not knowing a particular account type’s asset allocation, I code the type’s equity
allocation as 0%.
15
For example, stock market participation rates measured in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics rose from 23%
in 1984 to 37% in 1994 (Vissing-Jorgensen 2002). Nonstockholders are argued to be at a corner solution in portfolio
allocation (Mankiw and Zeldes 1991), and steadily declining costs to …nancial optimization is a common explanation

10

annuity in‡ows grew from $59.5 billion in 1986 to $258.2 billion in 2006. The growth was quite
linear and relatively stable over time. However, Figure 2b shows that the split in allocations of
annuity in‡ows across …xed annuities and variable annuities varied substantially over time. Fixed
annuity in‡ows grew at a slower overall rate than variable annuity in‡ows, but around those longrun time trends, in‡ows ‡uctuated dramatically. Conditional on time trends, …xed annuity in‡ows
and variable annuity in‡ows are very negatively correlated.
Table 1a displays summary statistics on quarterly annuity in‡ows and the …xed annual rate
of return o¤ered on new …xed annuities.

In the average quarter, $18.0 billion ‡owed into …xed

annuities while $24.0 billion ‡owed into variable annuities.

The …xed rate o¤ered on new …xed

annuities averaged 6.0%. Table 1b reports that S&P returns averaged 11.0% over this period with
standard deviation 15.6%. Figure 3 shows the time series of the …xed rate and S&P returns; S&P
returns exhibited no consistent trend while the …xed rate declined over time in line with other
interest rates. Importantly for this paper’s analysis of determinants of quarterly annuity in‡ows,
there is substantial independent variation at high frequencies in the …xed rate and S&P returns,
due to high frequency changes in S&P returns.
Table 1c displays summary statistics as of 2009 on new annuity investors.

The average new

annuity investor in 2009 was 65.7 years old, held $470,459 in …nancial assets, held 35.3% of those
…nancial assets in annuities, and allocated 40.3% of her …nancial assets to equities. Not displayed,
the average new …xed annuity investor held 32.8% of her …nancial assets in annuities while the
average new variable annuity investor held 36.0%.

The large share of …nancial assets held in

annuities suggests that a household’s choice between …xed and variable annuities will correlate
strongly with the household’s change in asset allocations between equities and other asset classes;
I report these tabulations below in Table 4.
for rising participation rates (Alan 2006).

11

The 25th percentile new annuity investor age was 56 years old and held $92,785 in …nancial
assets, so most new annuity investors are around retirement age and hold substantial …nancial
assets. Not tabulated, new annuity investors hold an average of $85,646 and a median of $51,060
in annuities. New …xed annuity investors hold somewhat more in annuities (average of $116,906,
median of $60,737) than new variable annuity investors (average of $76,744, median of $50,813).

IV

S&P Returns and Fixed Annuity In‡ows

If household investors chase stock market returns in order to ride a temporary bubble, they will not
chase returns into illiquid assets that are expensive to sell in the short run. Fixed annuity in‡ows
are a consistent measure of individual investors allocating wealth away from equities for years at a
time. I now test whether past S&P returns have a negative e¤ect on …xed annuity in‡ows and a
positive e¤ect on variable annuity in‡ows. If so, I conclude that household investors chase returns
into annuities in spite of their liquidity, inconsistent with ride-the-bubble intentions and instead
indicating buy-and-hold intentions.
To test whether lagged S&P returns a¤ect …xed annuity in‡ows, I estimate OLS regressions of
the form:

(1)

F IXED_IN F LOW Sq =

+

eq
1 Rq

+

eq
2 Rq 4

+

eq
3 Rq 8

+

eq
4 Rq 12

+ Rqf + q + "q

where F IXED_IN F LOW Sq denotes …xed annuity in‡ows in quarter q, Rqeq denotes the …rst
S&P annual return lag (the percentage change in the S&P over the twelve months preceding q),
Rqf denotes the average …xed rate of return o¤ered on …xed annuities purchased in quarter q, and
q denotes a linear time trend as motivated by the trend visible in Figure 2. I include four S&P
annual return lags because four minimize the Bayes information criterion; I present results with
only one lag as well.

In such time series regressions in which both dependent and independent

variables are persistent, errors "q can be autocorrelated. The standard correction is to estimate
12

Newey-West standard errors allowing for autocorrelation across a su¢ cient number of lags; here, I
allow for autocorrelation across sixteen quarterly lags, corresponding to the four S&P annual return
lags.
The

terms are the coe¢ cients of interest: the e¤ect of lagged S&P returns on …xed annuity

in‡ows. The identifying assumption is that, conditional on the …xed rate and time trend, lagged
S&P returns are orthogonal to unobserved determinants "q of …xed annuity in‡ows; I investigate
potential identi…cation threats in Section V. If the

coe¢ cients are negative and statistically

signi…cant, I conclude that household investors chase returns into …xed annuities. If on the contrary
the

coe¢ cients are statistically indistinguishable from zero, I conclude that there is no evidence

that household investors chase returns into …xed annuities.
Figure 4 illustrates the core result of the paper.

Each panel displays the actual time series

of …xed annuity in‡ows and a …tted time series using equation (1).

Figure 4a displays the …t

from estimating (1) without lagged S&P returns. This speci…cation explains almost none of the
variation around the linear trend.

Figure 4b displays the …t from estimating (1) with the …rst

S&P return lag. The addition of this one regressor dramatically improves the …t, with high lagged
S&P returns corresponding to low …xed annuity in‡ows. Figure 4c displays the …t from estimating
(1) with four S&P return lags, the preferred speci…cation. This …t closely matches the time series
‡uctuations in …xed annuity in‡ows, including the large and sustained spike after the dot-com bust
as well as smaller ‡uctuations throughout the time series. This is simple evidence that lagged S&P
returns predict subsequent …xed annuity in‡ows.
Table 2 reports the coe¢ cient estimates and standard errors from the regressions underlying
Figure 4. Columns 1, 3, and 4 correspond to Figures 4a-c, respectively. Column 4 is the preferred
speci…cation. The coe¢ cients imply that a one-standard-deviation (15.6-percentage-point) higher
S&P return last year, two years ago, three years ago, and four years ago reduce this quarter’s …xed

13

annuity in‡ows by $3.0 billion, $2.3 billion, $1.7 billion, and $0.9 billion, respectively, amounting
to $31.7 billion over the course of a full calendar year relative to mean annual …xed annuity in‡ows
of $72.0.

These magnitudes amount to respective reductions of 16.7%, 12.9%, 9.4%, and 5.1%

of the mean quarterly in‡ow amount of $18.0 billion. t-statistics on these e¤ects range from 3.7
to 12.2. This speci…cation explains 86% of the variance in …xed annuity in‡ows, relative to 34%
without S&P return lags (column 1). I conclude that S&P returns have a strong negative e¤ect on
subsequent …xed annuity in‡ows, in spite of their illiquidity and inconsistent with ride-the-bubble
intentions.
Note that the estimated impact of lagged S&P returns decays: more distant lags have a smaller
impact on current …xed annuity in‡ows than more recent lags do. On average across the four most
recent S&P lags, each S&P lag has an estimated e¤ect on …xed annuity in‡ows equal to 68.2% of
the e¤ect of the one-year-more-recent lag. This qualitative pattern of decay accords with recent
parameterizations of the impact of lagged S&P returns on the reported expectations of stock market
returns (Greenwood and Shleifer 2014) and on the portfolio allocation decisions (Malmendier and
Nagel 2011) of household investors. Interestingly, the annual decay rate estimated here (31.8% per
year) is about one-third as fast as the decay rate estimated in Greenwood and Shleifer’s analysis of
reported expectations of short-term stock market returns (approximately 90% per year) and about
1.5 times faster than the decay rate estimated in Malmendier and Nagel’s analysis of stock market
participation (approximately 13% per year).16

This pattern is perhaps unsurprising given the

volatility of these di¤erent outcomes: reported expectations of short-run market returns are more
volatile than …xed annuity in‡ows, which in turn are more volatile than stock market participation
rates.

However, each of these three decay rates is measured with substantial error and under

parametric assumptions, so caution is warranted in comparing their precise magnitudes.
16

The Malmendier-Nagel annual decay rate varies by age and by lag length; 13% equals the average annual decay
rate for the Malmendier-Nagel example of a …fty year old (details available upon request).

Robustness

The previous section found that S&P returns strongly negatively predict subsequent …xed annuity
in‡ows. This suggests that individual investors respond to poor S&P returns by allocating their
wealth away from equities for years at a time, inconsistent with market-timing motives. However,
there are at least three potential challenges to this conclusion. First, perhaps poor S&P returns
cause …xed annuity in‡ows to rise for features unrelated to its zero equity allocation; for example,
perhaps household investors prefer both …xed-return and equity-linked investment accounts o¤ered
by life insurance companies after incurring poor returns in brokerage accounts. Second, perhaps
the results of equation (1) are confounded by a misspeci…ed time trend. Third, perhaps new …xed
annuity investors increase the equity share of their remaining assets, leaving their overall asset
allocation unchanged and minimizing the relevance of the …xed annuity results. I address the …rst
two challenges in this section; I address the third in the next section.

V.A

Fixed-versus-Variable Annuity In‡ows

Figure 4 and Table 2 examined the e¤ect of S&P returns on …xed annuity in‡ows in isolation,
motivated by the unique illiquidity of …xed annuity allocations.

However, perhaps S&P returns

negatively a¤ect both …xed and variable annuity in‡ows, indicating that the earlier results re‡ect
an overall annuity e¤ect and not a return chasing e¤ect.

I address this possibility by repeating

the previous section’s analyses for the alternative outcome of the …xed annuity share of total (…xed
plus variable) annuity in‡ows. Analysis of the …xed annuity share of total annuity in‡ows asks:
conditional on a dollar being an invested in annuity, do lagged S&P returns predict whether the
dollar is invested in a …xed annuity rather than a variable annuity?
Figure 5 replicates Figure 4 for the …xed annuity share of total annuity in‡ows. As in Figure
4, each panel of Figure 5 displays the actual time series of the …xed annuity share of total annuity

15

in‡ows along with a …tted time series using equation (1) with di¤erent sets of regressors.

The

regression underlying the …t displayed in panel A excludes S&P return lags; the …t underlying
panel B includes one S&P return lag; and the …t underlying panel C includes four S&P return lags.
If S&P returns simply predict total annuity in‡ows and not …xed annuity in‡ows in particular, S&P
return lags should not predict the …xed share of total annuity in‡ows. Yet as in Figure 4, Figure 5
shows that the addition of a single S&P return lag substantially improves the …t, and the addition
of four S&P return lags yields a relatively tight …t of the overall time series.
Table 3 columns 1-4 formalize these results. Column 4 is the preferred speci…cation. The coe¢ cients imply that a one-standard-deviation (15.6-percentage-point) higher S&P return last year,
two years ago, three years ago, and four years ago reduce this quarter’s …xed annuity in‡ows by
5.9 percentage points, 4.4 percentage points, 5.0 percentage points, 4.0 percentage points, respectively. These magnitudes amount to respective reductions of 12%, 9%, 10%, and 8% of the mean
…xed share of total annuity in‡ows (47.8%)— broadly similar to the magnitudes of the preferred
speci…cation of column 4. t-statistics on these e¤ects range from 3.7 to 8.2. Hence, the negative
e¤ect of S&P returns on subsequent annuity in‡ows is not simply an overall annuity e¤ect.
Table 3 columns 5-8 present analogous evidence for variable annuity in‡ows considered in isolation. The ability to rebalance variable annuity portfolios minimizes the direct relevance of these
results, but analysis of variable annuity in‡ows evaluates whether S&P returns have the anticipated
positive e¤ect on equity-linked annuity in‡ows, rather than the feared negative e¤ect.

Indeed I

…nd that across the speci…cations, lagged S&P returns have large positive and signi…cant e¤ects on
subsequent variable annuity in‡ows. Hence, individual investors respond to poor S&P returns by
contributing to …xed annuities in particular, not just annuities generally.

16

V.B

Multiplicative Time Trend

Equation (1) assumes that the dollar e¤ect of a given lagged S&P return on …xed annuity in‡ows
is time-invariant. However, Figure 2 showed an upward time trend in in‡ows, suggesting that the
responsiveness of in‡ows to a given S&P lag may have increased over time and thus that (1) is
mispseci…ed. I therefore replicate Table 2 columns 1-4 using the following alternative speci…cation
that allows for a multiplicative time trend:

eq

estimated with nonlinear least squares and with q beginning at 0.

+

eq

+ Rqf ) + "q

This speci…cation allows the

sensitivity of …xed annuity in‡ows to the regressors to rise over time alongside the rise over time
in …xed annuity in‡ows.
The results are reported in Table 2 columns 5-8. Column 8 shows that the coe¢ cients on the
lagged S&P returns remain highly statistically signi…cant. Using

to scale the

coe¢ cients for the

mean quarter, the coe¢ cients imply that a one-standard-deviation (15.6-percentage-point) higher
S&P return last year, two years ago, three years ago, and four years ago reduce this quarter’s …xed
annuity in‡ows by $2.9 billion, $2.1 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.2 billion, respectively— similar to
the magnitudes of the preferred speci…cation of column 4.17 Thus the qualitative and quantitative
results of the main speci…cations of Section IV hold under these alternative speci…cations.

VI

Relevance for Household-Level Portfolios

The previous two sections documented the central …nding of the paper: household investors respond
to poor S&P returns by allocating wealth to …xed annuities and thus away from equities for years
at a time, inconsistent with ride-the-bubble motives. However, this fact may be minimally relevant
if new …xed annuity investors increase the equity share of their non-annuity assets, leaving their
17

p

overall asset allocations unchanged. Thus in this section, I use the 2007-2009 Survey of Consumer
Finances introduced in Section III.C to measure whether the average household’s decision to allocate
assets to …xed annuities is associated with a substantial change in the household’s share of …nancial
assets allocated to equities. By examining mean changes in household-level equity shares, I produce
estimates for the typical U.S. annuity investor.
Column 1 of Table 4a displays the simple result: the average household that invested in a
…xed annuity between 2007 and 2009 reduced its equity share of …nancial assets over the same
period by 29.9 percentage points, with a t-statistic of 4.4. Hence, …xed annuity investments are
associated with large reductions in household-level equity exposure in the household’s full …nancial
asset portfolio. In contrast, column 2 shows that the average household that invested in a variable
annuity between 2007 and 2009 modestly and insigni…cantly increased its equity share of …nancial
assets by 5.6 percentage points. The di¤erence in these changes is large (35.5 percentage points)
and in line with the fact from Table 1c that new annuity investors hold 35.3% of their assets in
annuities.
Table 4b shows that these di¤erences in equity exposure changes between new …xed annuity
investors and new variable annuity investors are not driven by di¤erences in age, wealth, or initial
equity exposure. The panel displays estimates from OLS regressions of the form:

(3)

EQU IT Y _SHAREi =

+ N EW _F IXED_IN V EST ORi + Xi + "i

on the sample of households that held no annuity assets in 2007 and where

EQU IT Y _SHAREi

equals the share of household i’s 2009 equity share of …nancial assets minus the household’s 2007
equity share of …nancial assets, N EW _F IXED _IN V EST ORi is an indicator for whether household i held a …xed annuity in 2009, and Xi is a possibly empty vector of household-level controls.
The

term is the coe¢ cient of interest: the correlation between the household’s decision to invest

18

in a …xed rather than a variable annuity and the change in the average household’s equity share.
Column 1 shows that without controls, new …xed annuity investors experienced a 35.5 percentage
point decline in their equity share relative to new variable annuity investors— a magnitude equal
to the di¤erence between the two mean changes listed in Table 4a.

Columns 4-6 ask whether

this large di¤erence is driven by selection into annuity type by successively controlling for quartics
in household age, size of the household’s 2007 …nancial assets, and the household’s 2007 equity
share of …nancial assets. The equity share change associated with the decision to invest in a …xed
annuity remains largely constant at around 35 percentage points and very statistically signi…cant
across these speci…cations.
Hence, households that invest in …xed annuities do not maintain a constant overall equity
allocation by increasing the equity exposure of their non-annuity …nancial assets.

Instead, the

household decision to invest in a …xed annuity is associated with a large reduction in the household’s
overall equity exposure that is not explained by household demographics.

VII

An Interpretation

The last three sections have demonstrated that individual investors respond to poor S&P returns
by allocating wealth to …xed annuities and thus away from equities for years at a time, inconsistent.

This challenges the riding-the-bubble explanation of return chasing because …xed annuity

assets cannot be cheaply reallocated to equities in the near term. Such long-run return-chasing is
quantitatively important for household asset allocations: household-level allocations to …xed annuities are associated with large reductions in household-level equity exposure. Thus it appears that
recent S&P returns a¤ect households’ long-run asset allocation plans, not just near-term trading
strategies.
A natural question is what drives return chasing into illiquid assets. Time variation in asset

19

allocations can of course be driven by time variation in expected returns, risk aversion, or discount
rates, and time variation in these factors can produce observationally equivalent behavior. Returnchasing behavior is typically framed in terms of expected returns.

Thus as a purely descriptive

exercise in order to convey magnitudes under one candidate explanation, I ask what changes in the
expected long-run equity return can explain the results, under the strong assumption that demand
for …xed annuities is a¢ ne in the expected long-run equity premium akin to Kim and Omberg
(1996) and Campbell and Viceira (1999).
Speci…cally, suppose that on average over the population, demand for …xed annuities is a linear
function of the expected long-run equity premium as well as a time trend to re‡ect the secular
trend in annuity in‡ows:

~ eq denotes the annualized long-run (e.g. over the …ve-to-ten-year maturity of a typical

annuity) equity return beginning in quarter q and where Rqf denotes the average …xed rate of return
o¤ered on …xed annuities purchased in quarter q. This a¢ ne demand approximation corresponds to
the optimal portfolio rules derived in Kim and Omberg (1996) and Campbell and Viceira (1999) who
consider environments with a risky asset that exhibits an AR(1) return premium over a riskless
asset and investors who can rebalance frequently.18

Further suppose that individual investors

update their expectations of the long-run equity return using an unrestricted weighted average of
the …rst-through-fourth S&P return lags:

Substituting (4) into (5), one simply derives the paper’s main estimating equation (1). Thus
18

A¢ ne demand for the risky asset does not hold in more complex environments. For example with stochastic
interest rates, investors optimally hedge the risk that interest rates will decline, adding complexity to optimal portfolio
rules as in Campbell and Viceira (2001).

20

one can use the coe¢ cient estimates of equation (1) to parameterize the underlying expectation
formation weights

p

as the ratio of the responsiveness

lag p and the responsiveness

p

of …xed annuity in‡ows to S&P return

of …xed annuity in‡ows to the …xed rate: ^ p =

^ =^ .
p

This is

an intuitive expression: under (4), the expected equity premium rises when either the expected
long-run equity return rises or when the …xed rate falls, and the responsiveness of …xed annuity
in‡ows to lagged S&P returns relative to the …xed rate pins down the degree to which S&P return
lags a¤ect the expected long-run equity return.
Thus under these strong reduced-form assumptions, the coe¢ cient estimates reported in Table 2
column 4 imply that …xed annuity investors behave as if they raise their expectation of the long-run
equity return by 6.6%, 5.1%, 3.7%, and 2.0% of the …rst-through-fourth S&P lags:19

(:006)

(:007)

(:008)

(:005)

Such updating would imply large changes in expectations of the long-run equity premium, including
a decline of 8.7 percentage points from 1999 to 2003. However, I stress that this “as-if”analysis is
purely descriptive and represents only one possible form of the underlying beliefs and preferences
that motivate return chasing into illiquid assets.

VIII

Conclusion

This paper has conducted a simple test of household motives when chasing stock market returns.
Households’reported expectations suggest that they chase returns in order to “ride the bubble”—
buying in advance of a temporary stock market rally and selling in advance of a temporary decline—
implying that they do not chase returns into illiquid assets. Fixed annuities are illiquid assets, and
19

The standard errors reported here are computed using the delta method with the same Newey-West covariance
matrix underlying the standard errors reported in Table 2 column 4.

21

a rise in …xed annuity in‡ows re‡ects households locking additional wealth out of the stock market
for several years at a time.

I …nd that …xed annuity in‡ows rise substantially after poor stock

market returns, inconsistent with ride-the-bubble intentions and instead indicating buy-and-hold
intentions. The results are consistent with households extrapolating recent stock market returns
into the long run.
Subsequent work could advance these results in at least two directions.

Positively, surveys

that solicit household intentions at the moment of asset reallocations could further distinguish
among return chasing motives.

Normatively, the United States subsidizes three major types

of retirement accounts: employer-provided accounts with limited annual contributions (401(k)s),
brokerage-provided accounts with limited annual contributions (IRAs), and insurer-provided accounts with unlimited contributions (annuities). To the extent that households face optimization
frictions, detailed comparisons of how Americans use each account type could facilitate optimal
retirement account design (Carroll, Choi, Laibson, Madrian, and Metrick 2009; Chetty, Friedman,
Leth-Petersen, Nielsen, and Olsen forthcoming).

Notes - Panel A reports statistics from quarterly data on annuity inflows and annuity terms as published by LIMRA, the leading life
insurance industry research group. Fixed annuity inflows equals the assets committed to new fixed annuity accounts in the quarter, and
likewise for variable annuity inflows. Total annuity inflows equals the sum of fixed annuity inflows and variable annuity inflows. Inflows are
measured gross of outflows (outflows are not available but small). The fixed rate offered on new fixed annuities equals the fixed annual
rate of return offered on the typical new fixed annuity. Panel B reports statistics on S&P returns. The lagged S&P return for a quarter that
begins in month m equals the percentage change between the average daily closing price in month m-13 and month m-1 in nominal
terms. Panel C reports statistics on households in the 2007-2009 Survey of Consumer Finances panel who held zero annuity assets in
2007 but held positive annuity assets in 2009, weighted by the inverse of their sampling probabilities. Age refers to the 2009 age of the
member of the household who completed the 2009 survey. Financial assets equals the sum of balances across annuity, checking,
savings, 401(k), individual retirement, Keogh, brokerage, and revocable trust accounts in 2009. Annuity share of financial assets equals
the share of financial assets held in annuity accounts in 2009. Equity share of financial assets equals the share of financial assets invested
in stocks in 2009. All monetary figures are in 2010 dollars. The data underlying panels A and B compose the main quarterly analysis
dataset; the SCF data are used for supplementary analyses.

Notes - This table tests whether lagged S&P returns affect fixed annuity inflows. See the notes to Table 1 and Section III for variable definitions. Columns 1-4
report coefficients from OLS regressions of quarterly fixed annuity inflows on the displayed combination of lagged S&P returns, the fixed rate of return on fixed
annuities, and a linear time trend. Newey-West standard errors allowing for autocorrelation across sixteen quarterly lags are in parentheses. The implied
effect of each lagged S&P return being one standard deviation above the mean (as in the late 1990s) equals the sum of the coefficients on the lagged S&P
returns, multiplied by the standard deviation of lagged S&P returns reported in Table 1. See Figures 4a-c for the time series fits generated by the regressions
underlying columns 1, 3, and 4, respectively. Columns 5-8 replicate columns 1-4 while imposing a multiplicative time trend estimated using nonlinear least
squares, which allows the sensitivity of fixed annuity inflows to the regressors to rise over time. The implied effect of one-standard-deviation-higher S&P return
lags for these specifications is evaluated at the mean quarter; see Section V.B for the formula.

Notes - Panel A uses the 2007-2009 Survey of Consumer Finances panel to report the mean
and standard error of 2007-2009 equity share changes for new annuity investors. A household's
2007-2009 equity share change equals the household's 2009 equity share of financial assets
minus the household's 2007 equity share of financial assets. New fixed annuity investors are
defined as new annuity investors who held no stocks in their annuities in 2009; all other new
annuity investors are classified as new variable annuity investors. See the notes to Table 1 and
Section III for more variable details. Panel B uses the same data to report estimates from
regressions of the household's 2007-2009 equity share change on whether the household was a
new fixed annuity investor. The coefficient in column 3 equals the difference between the
means reported in columns 1 and 2. Columns 4-6 successively control for quartics in household
age, the size of the household's 2007 financial assets, and the households 2007 equity share.

U.S. equity mutual fund inflows

Notes: This graph plots the 1993-2011 quarterly time series of nominal lagged 12-month S&P returns and net inflows to U.S.
equity mutual funds—similar to the annually published Figure 2.4 in the Investment Company Institute Fact Book. The lagged
S&P return for a quarter that begins in month m equals the percentage difference between the average S&P daily closing price in
month m 13 and month m 1. Net inflows equals gross inflows to U.S.-based equity-only mutual funds minus gross outflows
from these funds in 2010 dollars and excluding reinvested dividends; gross inflows (not shown) exhibit a similar pattern. The
series are correlated with coefficient 0.46. Flows data were provided by the Investment Company Institute.

Variable annuity inflows

Notes: Panel A plots the quarterly time series of total annuity inflows, equal to the sum of fixed annuity inflows and variable
annuity inflows. Panel B plots the time series of fixed annuity inflows and variable annuity inflows separately. U.S. annuities are
not annuities in the traditional economic sense: rather than lifetime income streams, U.S. annuities are tax-preferred savings
vehicles into which households nearing retirement make typically large one-time contributions. Investors choose either a fixed
(fixed-return) or variable (equity-linked) annuity at the time of contribution. Unlike variable annuity contributions, fixed annuity
contributions cannot be reallocated across asset classes before the annuity’s pre-specified maturity of typically five to ten years
without triggering substantial surrender fees. Inflows are in 2010 dollars and gross of outflows (outflows are not available but
small).

Lagged S&P return
Fixed rate of return on new fixed annuities

Notes: This graph illustrates independent variation in the paper’s key quarterly explanatory variables: nominal lagged 12-month
S&P returns and the fixed rate of return offered on new fixed annuities. The lagged S&P return for a quarter that begins in month
m equals the percentage difference between the average S&P daily closing price in month m 13 and month m 1. The fixed rate
offered on new fixed annuities equals the fixed annual rate of return offered on the typical new fixed annuity. The main analysis
of this paper uses 84 quarters of data between 1986 and 2006; I display twelve additional quarters of lagged S&P returns because
the preferred specification includes the first-through-fourth S&P return lags.

Notes: This figure illustrates the ability of lagged S&P returns to explain quarterly fixed annuity inflows. The three panels plot the
fitted time series generated by the OLS regressions underlying Table 2 columns 1, 3, and 4, respectively. Panel A plots actual
fixed annuity inflows (as in Figure 2b) and the fit generated by a regression of quarterly fixed annuity inflows on a linear time
trend and the fixed rate of return offered on new fixed annuities. Panel B displays the fit generated when the quarter’s first S&P
return lag (the 12-month S&P return preceding the quarter) is included in the regression. Panel C displays the fit generated when
the quarter’s first-through-fourth S&P return lags (the four successive 12-month S&P returns over the 48 months preceding the
quarter) are included in the regression. See Figures 2-3 for variable definitions.
