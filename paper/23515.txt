Reorganization or Liquidation: Bankruptcy Choice and Firm Dynamics
Dean Corbae and Pablo D'Erasmo
NBER Working Paper No. 23515
June 2017
JEL No. E22,G32,G33
ABSTRACT
In this paper, we ask how bankruptcy law affects the financial decisions of corporations and its
implications for firm dynamics. According to current U.S. law, firms have two bankruptcy
options: Chapter 7 liquidation and Chapter 11 reorganization. Using Compustat data, we first
document capital structure and investment decisions of non-bankrupt, Chapter 11, and Chapter 7
firms. Using those data moments, we then estimate parameters of a firm dynamics model with
endogenous entry and exit to include both bankruptcy options in a general equilibrium
environment. Finally, we evaluate a bankruptcy policy change recommended by the American
Bankruptcy Institute that amounts to a “fresh start” for bankrupt firms. We find that changes to
the law can have sizable consequences for borrowing costs and capital structure which via
selection affects productivity (allocative efficiency rises by 2.58%) and welfare (rises by 0.54%).

Introduction

According to Aghion, Hart, and Moore [2] (p. 524), Western bankruptcy procedures “are
thought either to cause the liquidation of healthy firms (as in Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code) or to be inefficient and biased toward reorganization under incumbent management (as
in Chapter 11 in the United States).” Aghion, et. al. [2] go on to propose a bankruptcy policy
similar to a recent proposal by the American Bankruptcy Institute that amounts to a “fresh
start” for the firm (existing debt is forgiven, and the new all-equity firm is allocated to former
claim holders using the priority rule).1 To evaluate the implications of bankruptcy procedures
for firm value, industry dynamics, and household welfare, we estimate a structural corporate
finance model with both Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 bankruptcy options using Compustat data
and then consider the above mentioned policy counterfactual.
We find that the reform results in a considerable reduction of the bankruptcy rate (by
51.1%) and a shift toward reorganization (away from inefficient liquidation) with a modest
contraction of the exit rate. There is a significant increase in the investment rate (+19.1%)
at the firm level due, in most part, to a large reduction in the fraction of firms that operate
in the “inaction” region (i.e., firms operating with investment rates close to 0%). Prior to
the reform, incentives to hold capital as collateral are stronger and induce firms to operate
at an inefficient scale. Better credit terms after the reform result in a change in the firm
size distribution (the average size of incumbent decreases, and the average size of the entrant
increases), reduce the fraction of firms with investment bursts (by more than 5%), improve
allocative efficiency, and increase output weighted productivity by close to 0.5% (measured
total factor productivity (TFP) increases by a similar percentage). The combination of these
effects results in a reduction in aggregate adjustment and bankruptcy costs that induce an
increase in aggregate consumption (+0.54%).2
Besides evaluating an important policy counterfactual, our paper makes two further contributions to the literature. First, using Compustat data from 1980 to 2014, we document
capital structure and investment differences between non-bankrupt, Chapter 11 and Chapter
7 firms.3 Our paper thus complements several studies that document heterogeneity among
firms that choose Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 bankruptcy. One of the most recent papers is by
Bris, Welch, and Zhu [10] who provide a comprehensive study of the costs of Chapter 7 versus
Chapter 11 in a sample of 300 public and private firms in Arizona and New York from 1995
to 2001. Reorganization by Chapter 11 comprises 80% of their sample. Chapter 11 firms are

A Chapter 7 bankruptcy policy that gives consumers a “fresh start” has been in practice since 1978. For an
analysis of the policy, see Livshits, MacGee and Tertilt [30] and Chatterjee, et. al. [12].
2
The idea that policies that affect the cost of exit can have important implications for entry, the firm size
distribution, and welfare is not new. For instance, Hopenhayn and Rogerson [26] (see Table 3) find that firing costs
can have a significant impact on hiring, the firm size distribution, and welfare.

substantially larger in terms of assets, have a larger fraction of secured debt, and have roughly
similar debt-to-asset ratios to Chapter 7 (see their Table 1). Importantly, their paper documents substantial differences in recovery rates. In particular, Table 13 documents the median
(mean) recovery rate (as a percentage of the initial claim) as 5.8% (27.4%) for Chapter 7,
while it is 79.2% (69.4%) for Chapter 11. Further, the fraction of firms that have 0% recovery
is 79% for Chapter 7 and 0% for Chapter 11. These means are similar to those by Acharya,
Barath, and Srinivasan [1], who document (Table 8) that the mean recovery rate for Chapter
7 is 26.38% and for Chapter 11 is 68.43%.4
As Bris, et. al. [10] point out, whether a corporation files for Chapter 7 or 11 is endogenous,
and self-selection can contaminate the estimation of bankruptcy costs. In particular, if firms
self-select, then it could be misleading to compare the cost of procedures without controlling
for endogeneity of chapter choice. The authors carefully attempt to control for self-selection
into bankruptcy chapter (Chapter 7 or 11) in their regressions. Endogeneity issues lead us
to consider a structural framework. Our second contribution is to extend the basic structural
corporate finance models of Cooley and Quadrini [13], Gomes [20], and Hennessy and Whited
[23] to incorporate a non-trivial bankruptcy choice.5,6,7 Adding a non-trivial bankruptcy choice
to an environment where cash flows can turn negative (due to fixed costs, as in Hopenhayn [24])
has important implications beyond the selection issues raised above. For instance, it implies
that liquidation arises in equilibrium for a subset of firms in our model, while it does not in
Cooley and Quadrini [13] or Hennessy and Whited [23]. It even shows up methodologically
since, with liquidation costs that depend on the amount of collateral, here we must expand
the state space and cannot simply use net worth. Further, these papers only consider take-itor-leave-it bargaining in renegotiation.8
Our paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we document bankruptcy facts in the Compustat dataset. In Section 3, we propose a general equilibrium environment with firm dynamics
where there are Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 bankruptcy choices. Section 4 defines an equilibrium, and Section 5 estimates model parameters for that environment. Section 6 presents
equilibrium capital structure and investment decision rules in the presence of competitive debt
4

These values are themselves averages between no industry distress and industry distress states.
In an important corporate finance paper, Broadie, Chernov, and Sundaresan [11] study Chapter 7 versus Chapter
11 decision problem but in a much simpler model with exogenous cash flows and initial bond finance of fixed
investment. Also related are Peri [35], who in a model with fixed capital, focuses on labor contract renegotiations
during Chapter 11 reorganization, and Tamayo [40], who studies the effects of eliminating Chapter 11 reorganization
in a partial equilibrium model with private information where default can lead to liquidation or reorganization but
debt is constant over the life of the firm.

Other closely related papers that incorporate liquidation include Arellano, Bai and Zhang [6]; D’Erasmo and
Moscoso Boedo [16]; Khan, Senga, and Thomas [28]; Meh and Terajima [32]; and Cooper and Ejarque [14].

Our paper also contributes to the literature on firm dynamics and misallocation pioneered by Restuccia and
Rogerson [36] and Hsieh and Klenow [27], with important contributions by Guner, Ventura, and Xu [21]; Midrigan
and Xu [31]; and Moll [33]. See Hopenhayn [25] for a recent review of the literature.

Eraslan [18] studies Chapter 11 in a more general bargaining environment.

and normative consequences of the policy counterfactual based on the “fresh start” proposal
by the American Bankruptcy Institute. Section 8 concludes.

Bankruptcy Facts from Compustat

Given the fact that the vast majority of empirical corporate finance papers use data from
Compustat, we organize bankruptcy facts using Compustat data from 1980 to 2014. This is
obviously a different sample than that in Bris, et. al. [10]. Some of our facts are similar
to those in Bris, et. al. [10] (e.g., the fraction of Chapter 11 bankruptcies relative to the
total number of bankruptcies), while other facts differ (firms are more highly levered in their
sample). We note, however, that there can be substantial differences in reported bankruptcy
facts across datasets. For instance, bankruptcy statistics on all business filings from the U.S.
Courts (www.uscourts.gov/Statistics/BankruptcyStatistics.aspx) suggest that the Bris, et. al.
[10] sample as well as ours overstates the proportion of Chapter 11 business bankruptcies. For
instance, in the U.S. Courts dataset (which includes smaller firms), the fraction of Chapter 11
business bankruptcies out of total business bankruptcies was roughly 25% for the year ending
in December 2013.
Besides simply comparing characteristics of firms in the state of bankruptcy as in [10] or the
U.S. Courts dataset, here we also compare characteristics of firms that are not bankrupt with
those that are bankrupt. Table 1 displays a summary of some key differences between Chapter
7, Chapter 11, and non-bankrupt firm variables, which have analogues in our model (see
Appendix A1 for a detailed description of the data). Since there can be substantial differences
between the median and mean of these variables, the table provides both. In Figures 1 and 2,
we graph the conditional distributions of some of the key variables in the model. Further, we
test whether the means differ between Chapter 7, Chapter 11, and non-bankrupt.
We follow the classification of Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 bankruptcy used by Duffie, Saita,
and Wang [17]. Chapter 7 in Table 1 corresponds to values for the final observation of a firm
that exits via a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Chapter 11 refers to an observation in the initial period
of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Non-bankrupt identifies annual observations of firms that are not
in the state of bankruptcy (i.e., firms that never declare bankruptcy) as well as observations of
firms before they declare bankruptcy, excluding the above. To be consistent with the way that
the U.S. Census Bureau constructs its exit statistics, a deleted firm (i.e., a firm that disappears
from our sample) is counted as a firm that exits if its deletion code is not 01 (mergers and
acquisitions), 02 (bankruptcy which we associate with Chapter 11), 04 (reverse acquisition),
09 (going private), or 07 and 10 (other). For example, this means that firms that are acquired
or go from public to private are not counted as exiting. Code 03 is defined as liquidation,

4

which we associate with Chapter 7. In the Appendix, we provide more information about the
frequencies of those events.

Note that in a stationary environment (or period by period if working with a time series), the frequency of exit,
the fraction of exit by Chapter 7, the frequency of (all) bankruptcy, and the fraction of Chapter 11 bankruptcy are
not independent moments. In particular, it is possible to write one of these moments as a function of the other
three. For example, let f x , f b , f b,11 denote the frequency of exit, the frequency of (all) bankruptcy, and the fraction
b
b,11
)
of Chapter 11 bankruptcy, respectively. Then, the fraction of exit by Chapter 7 equals f (1−f
. The moments
fx
shown in Table 1 correspond to the time series average with the exception of the fraction of exit by Chapter 7 that

5

of all firms declaring bankruptcy is also small (0.96%) in our sample; 79% of bankruptcies are
by Chapter 11 (as in [10]).
Since firms in our model choose physical capital and net debt (total debt minus cash),
we examine differences in size measured by total assets. Non-bankrupt firms are bigger than
Chapter 11 firms, which in turn are bigger than Chapter 7 firms. In all cases, the differences
in mean are statistically significant (at the 10% level).
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) measure a firm’s
profitability. Negative values generally indicate a firm has fundamental profitability issues,
while a positive value does not necessarily mean it is profitable since it generally ignores
changes in working capital as well as the other terms described above. The median and mean
ratio of EBITDA to assets is negative for both Chapter 11 and Chapter 7 firms, while it is
positive for non-bankrupt firms. Differences in mean between non-bankrupt versus Chapter
11 and Chapter 7 are statistically significant, but not statistically significant between Chapter
11 versus Chapter 7. These statistics accord well with the idea that bankrupt firms have
profitability problems.
We provide several measures of leverage. Net debt is measured as debt minus cash, where
negative values imply that the firm is highly liquid. We find that both median and mean net
debt or total debt to assets are highest for Chapter 11 and lowest for non-bankrupt firms.
Statistical significance of differences in mean leverage exists across all types. The time average
of the fraction of firms with negative net debt (i.e., liquid firms) is higher for non-bankrupt
than bankrupt firms. There is a statistically significant difference in means between bankrupt
and non-bankrupt, as well as between Chapter 11 and Chapter 7. The ratio of secured to
total debt is highest for Chapter 7 and lowest for non-bankrupt firms. There is a statistically
significant difference in means between non-bankrupt versus Chapter 11 and Chapter 7, but
not between Chapter 11 and Chapter 7. Interest coverage is measured as the ratio of EBITDA
to interest expenses. It is generally thought that a ratio less than one is not sustainable for
long. Here we see that both mean and median interest coverage is positive and large for
non-bankrupt firms, while it is in general negative for bankrupt firms. There are insignificant
statistical differences in mean between the two bankruptcy choices, but the differences are
statistically significant between bankrupt and non-bankrupt.
presents the value consistent with the other three in a stationary environment. Since there is significant variation
in the value of this moment over time (the maximum observed is 100% and the minimum is 1.6%), the time series
average of this moment is different from the value consistent with the other three moments and reported in the table
(59.88 versus 19.83).

Equity issuance is highest for non-bankrupt firms, and it is statistically significant relative
to bankrupt firms but statistically insignificant between bankruptcy choices. The time average
of the fraction of firms issuing equity in any given period is highest for Chapter 11 and lowest
for Chapter 7, though the differences are only statistically significant between non-bankrupt
and bankrupt.
Median and average net investment (gross investment minus depreciation) is positive for
non-bankrupt firms and negative for bankrupt firms. The differences between non-bankrupt
and bankrupt are statistically significant but not statistically significant between Chapter 11
and Chapter 7. Dividend payouts are highest for non-bankrupt firms and lowest for Chapter
11 firms. In terms of means, there is a statistically significant difference between Chapter 11
and other types of firms.
We also consider two well accepted measures of corporate default probabilities from the
finance literature: z-scores and distance-to-default (DD). The Altman [3] z-score is a linear
combination of five common firm-level ratios: working capital to assets, retained earnings
to assets, earnings before interest and taxes, market value of equity to book value of total
liabilities, and sales to total assets. While simplistic, Altman’s z-score is widely used by

7

practitioners as a predictor of default within the next two years, with values greater than 2.9
deemed safe while values less than 1 are indicative of distress. Table 1 documents that both the
median and average z-scores for non-bankrupt firms exceed 3, while z-scores for both Chapter
7 and Chapter 11 are generally below 1. All differences in mean are statistically significant.
The DD measure is based upon an estimate of the asset value and volatility of a firm using
an option pricing model, along with the observed book value of debt and market value of
equity. To compute estimates of asset value and volatility, we use an iterative procedure as
in Duffie, et. al. [17] (see Appendix for a full description of the construction of DD). Table 1
documents that the average DD is significantly higher for firms we classify as bankrupt than
non-bankrupt.

In summary, non-bankrupt firms: (i) are bigger than bankrupt firms; (ii) are profitable
while bankrupt firms are not; (iii) have lower leverage than bankrupt firms; (iv) have lower
interest expenses relative to their cash flow; (v) do not have statistically significant differences
in equity issuance; (vi) have positive net investment as opposed to negative net investment for
bankrupt firms; (vii) have higher dividend payouts than bankrupt firms; and (viii) have lower
likelihoods of default as measured by practitioners “models” of default. Further, in terms

8

of statistical significance, there is resounding support for differences between bankrupt and
non-bankrupt firms but slightly less so between firms that choose Chapter 11 versus Chapter
7. This latter result could be due to the small sample size of bankrupt firms.

3

Environment

We consider a discrete time, general equilibrium model where heterogeneous firms produce
a homogeneous good and issue short-term defaultable debt and costly equity to undertake
investment and dividend choices. Since firms can choose Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 bankruptcy,
competitive lenders must attempt to predict default decisions of the firms they are lending
to when determining the price of debt. There is a representative household that maximizes
lifetime utility and whose income comes from wages and dividends on the shares that the
representative household holds in every firm. We will focus our attention on a stationary
equilibrium characterized by a measure of firms endogenously distributed across productivity,
capital, and net debt.

3.1

Firms and Technology

Competitive firms produce a homogeneous good that can be consumed by households or can
be used as capital. Firm j maximizes the expected discounted value of dividends:

t=0

where djt denotes dividends in period t and (1 + r)−1 is the discount rate of the firm.10 Firms

, α ∈ (0, 1), ν ∈ (0, 1),

(2)

where zjt ∈ Z ≡ {z 1 , . . . , z n } is an idiosyncratic productivity shock, i.i.d. across firms, that
follows a first-order Markov process with transition matrix G(zjt+1 |zjt ); njt ∈ R+ is labor
input; and kjt ∈ K ⊂ R+ is capital input. There is a fixed cost of production cf , measured in
units of output. Firms must pay this fixed cost in order to produce. Active firms own their
capital and decide the optimal level of gross investment: igjt = kjt+1 − (1 − δ)kjt = injt + δkjt ,
10
Since there are no aggregate shocks in this model, to conserve on notation here we define the objective using a
constant discount rate, which is consistent in equilibrium.

(3)

In any given period, firm j’s operating income (EBITDA) is given by:
πjt = yjt − wt njt − cf ,

where wt is the competitively determined real wage. Inputs can be financed from three sources:
(i) one-period non-contingent debt bjt+1 ∈ B ⊂ R at discounted price qjt ; (ii) current cash flow
and internal savings; and (iii) external equity at cost λ to raise funds (so with our assumptions
on taxes, firms will never find it optimal to simultaneously
pay dividends and issue equity).

Taxable income is Υjt = πjt − δkjt − qjt − 1 (1+r) (i.e., operating profits less economic
depreciation less discounted interest expense) and corporate taxes are:
Tjtc = 1{Υjt ≥0} τc · Υjt ,

(5)

where 1{·} is the indicator function that takes value one if the condition in brackets holds and
zero otherwise.11
The after-tax net cash flow to equity holders is given by:

ejt − λ(ejt ) if ejt < 0,

(6)

where:
ejt = πjt − Tjtc − igjt − bjt + qjt bjt+1 − Ψ(kjt+1 , kjt ).

(7)

In particular, firms pay dividends if ejt ≥ 0, which incurs dividend taxes τd . If ejt < 0, firms
pay external finance costs λ(ejt
). Provided
 taxable income is positive, the tax benefit of a unit
of debt is given by (1 − τd ) · τc q1jt − 1 /(1 + r) > 0.
Firms can enter by paying a cost κ.12 After paying this cost, which is financed by either
equity or debt issue, firms observe their initial level of productivity zj0 drawn from the stationary distribution G(z) derived from G(zjt+1 |zjt ). We denote the mass of new entrants as
M.
11

As in Strebulaev and Whited [38], we assume the firm takes the present value of the interest tax deduction in
the period in which it issues debt. This allows us to avoid adding another state variable. Further, for simplicity,
unlike Hennessy and Whited [23], we assume there are no loss limitations.
12
In our benchmark, we set κ as a resource cost. In Appendix A3.1, we analyze a different version of the model
where κ is denominated in labor units. The main results of our paper are robust to changes in the treatment of the
entry cost.

3.2

Financial Markets

Firms finance operations either through debt or equity. Equity issuance costs are an increasing
function λ(ejt ) of the amount of equity issued, and we normalize the number of shares per firm
to 1. A share is a divisible claim on the dividends of the firm.
Competitive lenders have access to one-period, risk-free, discount bonds at after-tax price
qtB .

Loans mature each period, and their price qjt depends on how much the firm borrows

bjt+1 as well as other characteristics such as firm capital holdings kjt+1 (since this affects
liquidation value) and current productivity zjt . Debt is non-contingent in the sense that it
does not depend on future zjt+1 .13
Firms can default on their debt, triggering a bankruptcy procedure. To resemble U.S. law,
we allow for two default options:
1. Chapter 7 liquidation: Firm j liquidates its assets at firesale discount s7 < 1, which it
uses to pay debts; incurs a bankruptcy cost c7 ; and exits. Shareholders obtain (pre-tax)
max{s7 kjt − bjt − c7 , 0}. Lenders obtain min{bjt , max{s7 kjt − c7 , 0}}.
2. Chapter 11 reorganization: Firm j and lenders renegotiate the defaulted debt, bargain over the repayment fraction φjt (where the firm’s bargaining weight is given by θ);
the firm pays bankruptcy cost c11 , reduces its debt to φjt bjt (where φjt ∈ [0, 1]), and faces
equity finance costs λ11 (ejt ), debt finance costs λb11 ≤ 1, and a discount in its capital sales
s11 < 1 (i.e., 1{igjt <0} s11 igjt ); it is not allowed to pay dividends and continues operating
(i.e., does not exit).14
When making a loan to a firm, lenders take into account that in the case of default they
can recover up to a fraction of the original loan. As described above, the recovery rate of a
loan depends on the bankruptcy procedure chosen by the firm. In the case of a Chapter 7
liquidation, when making a loan of size bjt in period t, lenders can expect to recover in period

t + 1 min bjt+1 , max{s7 kjt+1 − c7 , 0}}, where s7 is the scrap price of the firm’s capital (which
serves as collateral).15 If the firm chooses to reorganize (i.e., Chapter 11), the recovery rate
in period t + 1 will be φjt+1 . That is, lenders will recover a fraction of debt that they agree
upon during the reorganization process. We assume the negotiation over recovery rate solves
a Nash bargaining problem, where the firm’s weight is θ and the lender’s weight is 1 − θ.
Of course, a firm can choose to exit without defaulting at any point in time. In this case,
the firm liquidates its assets (at value sx ∈ (s7 , 1]) and pays its debts in full.
13

Our use of equilibrium price menus, which depend on agent characteristics in the presence of default in a
quantitative model, is similar to that in Chatterjee, et. al. [12] and Hennessy and Whited [23].
14
Bankruptcy laws do not allow firms to divert funds by distributing dividends. See Bharath, Panchapagesan, and
Werner [9], who provide evidence that new financing under Chapter 11 comes with much more stringent restrictions
from creditors.
15
Hennesy and Whited [22] make a similar assumption. Stromberg [39] finds that asset fire sales and resales to
management can lead to low salvage values and striking inefficiencies in the Chapter 7 procedure.

Households

In any period t, households choose a stream of consumption Ct , shares {Sjt+1 }j of incumbent
and entrant firms, and risk-free bonds Bt+1 to maximize the expected present discounted value
of utility given by:

(pjt + djt ) Sjt dj + Bt + Tth ,

(9)

where pjt is the after-dividend stock price of firm j, qtB is the after-tax price of the risk-free
discount bond, and Tth are lump sum taxes/transfers for households. The marginal income
tax τi applied to wage and interest earnings is rebated back to households in Tth . It should
be understood that the stock price of a firm that exits is taken to be zero and that, since
preferences do not include leisure, households supply their unit of labor inelastically.

3.4

Timing

In this section, we describe the timing of the model. At the beginning of period t:
1. Productivity zjt is realized. The state space for incumbent firm j is given by {zjt , kjt , bjt }.
2. Bankrupty decision for incumbent firms:
• If the firm chooses to declare bankruptcy, it chooses whether to exit by Chapter 7
liquidation or to continue via Chapter 11 reorganization.
– If the firm chooses Chapter 7, it incurs costs (c7 , s7 ), pays “final dividends”
djt = (1 − τd ) max{s7 kjt − bjt − c7 , 0}, and exits.16
– If the firm chooses Chapter 11, it bargains with lenders over a recovery rate
φjt and incurs costs c11 , s11 . Once the firm and lenders agree on a recovery
rate, the firm repays φjt bjt and continues operating. Dividend payments are not
allowed during the bankruptcy period. It chooses an amount of capital kjt+1
and finances it via internal funds, new debt bjt+1 at price λb11 q(kjt+1 , bjt+1 , zjt ),
and/or equity issuance with costs λ11 (ejt ).
• If the firm chooses not to declare bankruptcy, it repays in full and chooses whether
to continue or to exit.
16

Note that because of our timing assumptions, the taxation issues about applying net operating losses in Chapter
7 are absent.

12

– If firm j chooses to continue after repaying bjt , it chooses the amount of capital
kjt+1 and finances it via internal funds, debt bjt+1 at price q(kjt+1 , bjt+1 , zjt ),
and/or equity issuance at cost λ(e).
– If firm j chooses to exit after repaying bjt , it pays “final dividends” djt = (1 −
τd ) (sx kjt − bjt ) if cx kjt ≥ bjt and djt = (cx kjt − bjt ) − λ(sx kjt − bjt ) otherwise.
Note that repayment avoids both bankruptcy costs c7 as well as salvage value
s7 .
3. Entry decision: Potential entrants decide whether to start a firm or not. If they enter,
they pay the entry cost κ and choose their initial level of capital by issuing equity at cost
λE (ejt ) or debt. The initial productivity shock is drawn from G(z).
4. Households choose shares and bonds, which given earnings and taxes determines their
consumption. If the household chooses to purchase the stock of an entrant, then Sjt+1 =
Sjt and djt = −kjt+1 + q(kjt+1 , bjt+1 )bjt+1 − κ − λE (−kjt+1 + q(kjt+1 , bjt+1 )bjt+1 − κ).

4

Equilibrium

We consider only stationary equilibria of the model. In what follows, we use the notation that
xt = x and xt+1 = x0 . Rather than refer to a given firm by its name j, it will be named by
its place in the cross-sectional distribution of firms Γ(z, k, b). To save on notation, we avoid
making the dependence of decision rules on prices explicit.

4.1

Recursive Representation of the Firm’s Problem

An incumbent firm starts the period with productivity z, capital k, and debt b. First, it makes
its bankruptcy decision. The value of the firm V (z, k, b) is defined as follows:
V (z, k, b) = max V∆ (z, k, b),

(10)

∆∈{0,1}

where ∆ = 0 denotes the decision not to declare bankruptcy while ∆ = 1 corresponds to the
decision to declare bankruptcy.
Conditional on the bankruptcy choice, the firm must choose whether it wants to exit x = 1
or not x = 0. In particular:
V∆ (z, k, b) = max V∆x (z, k, b).

(11)

x∈{0,1}

Note that a firm that chooses not to declare bankruptcy (∆ = 0) still must choose whether it
wants to exit x = 1 or not x = 0. On the other hand, a decision to declare bankruptcy and

13

choose exit (i.e., (∆ = 1, x = 1)) implies a Chapter 7 liquidation, while a decision to declare
bankruptcy and not exit (i.e., (∆ = 1, x = 0)) implies a Chapter 11 reorganization.
If the firm chooses not to declare bankruptcy and not to exit (i.e., (∆ = 0, x = 0)), then:
V00 (z, k, b) =

We denote the optimal labor, capital, debt, and dividend decision rules by n = hn0 (z, k, b),
k 0 = hk0 (z, k, b), b0 = hb0 (z, k, b), and d = hd0 (z, k, b), respectively.
If the firm chooses not to declare bankruptcy and to exit (i.e., (∆ = 0, x = 1)), the dividend
policy implies
(
V01 (z, k, b)

=

(1 − τd )(sx k − b)

if sx k ≥ b

sx k − b − λ(sx k − b) if sx k < b

.

(13)

That is, if the firm wishes to exit without using the limited liability benefit that Chapter 7
provides in the event of sx k < b, it must pay off its debt by an equity infusion.17
If the firm chooses to declare bankruptcy but not to exit (i.e., a Chapter 11 reorganization
(∆ = 1, x = 0)), we can define payoffs, taking as given the recovery rate φ(z, k, b) which will
be determined by Nash bargaining in subsection 4.4 below as:
V10 (z, k, b) =

d = e − λ11 (e).
We allow the external finance costs λb11 and λ11 (e) to differ for a firm under reorganization.
We denote the optimal labor, capital, debt, and dividend decision rules by n = hn1 (z, k, b),
k 0 = hk1 (z, k, b), b0 = hb1 (z, k, b), and d = hd1 (z, k, b), respectively.
Finally, if the firm chooses to declare bankruptcy and to exit (i.e., a Chapter 7 liquidation
(∆ = 1, x = 1)), then:
V11 (z, k, b) = (1 − τd ) max{s7 k − b − c7 , 0}.
17

Obviously, this won’t happen in equilibrium, but the option must be allowed for completeness.

Lender’s Problem

Lenders pool risky corporate loans and borrow from households in the risk-free market at price
q B . The profit on a loan of size b0 has two important components. First, the probability of
default Λ(b0 , k 0 , z) is given by:
X

Λ(b0 , k 0 , z) =

G(z 0 |z),

(18)

{z 0 ∈D7 (k0 ,b0 )}∪{z 0 ∈D11 (k0 ,b0 )}

where D7 (k, b) and D11 (k, b) denote the Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 default sets, respectively
defined as:
D7 (k, b) =



z ∈ Z : ∆(z, k, b) = 1 & x(z, k, b) = 1 , and

D11 (k, b) =



z ∈ Z : ∆(z, k, b) = 1 & x(z, k, b) = 0 .

The second important component of a lender’s profit is the expected recovery rate. If the

firm chooses to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the lender recovers min b0 , max{sk 0 − c7 , 0}}.
If the firm chooses to reorganize under Chapter 11, the lender will recover φ(z 0 , k 0 , b0 )b0 , which
is the solution to a bargaining game between the firm and the lender. Thus, we can write the
lender’s profit function as follows:

Ω(b0 , k 0 , z) = −q(b0 , k 0 , z)b0 + q B [1 − Λ(b0 , k 0 , z)]b0

(19)

4.4

Reorganization

Upon reaching a bargaining agreement, the value of defaulted debt is reduced to a fraction ϕ
of the unpaid debt b. The value of an agreement of size ϕ to the firm is:
V R (z, k, b; ϕ) =

max
0 0

n,b ,k ,d≤0

n
o
d + (1 + r)−1 Ez 0 |z [V (k 0 , b0 , z 0 )]

s.t.
e = π − T c (k, z, k 0 , b0 ) − 1{ig ≥0} ig − 1{ig <0} s11 ig − ϕb + q(k 0 , b0 , z)λb11 b0 − Ψ(k 0 , k) − c11 ,
d = e − λ11 (e).
After the repayment of a fraction ϕ of debt, the firm chooses the optimal level of investment;
can issue debt or equity, which may cost a different amount during renegotiation; and continues
operating.
Since either the borrower or lender in the renegotiation phase of Chapter 11 has a right
to declare Chapter 7 bankruptcy, we assume that the threat points are equal to the payoffs
associated with Chapter 7 liquidation.18 In that case, the surplus for the firm is:
W R (z, k, b; ϕ) = V R (z, k, b; ϕ) − (1 − τd ) max{s7 k − b − c7 , 0}.

(20)

Since the value of an agreement for the lender is ϕb (i.e., the recovery on defaulted debt), the
surplus for the lender is:

W L (z, k, b; ϕ) = ϕb − min b, max{s7 k − c7 , 0}}.

(21)

The recovery rate is then the solution to the following Nash bargaining problem:
φ(z, k, b) ≡ arg max [W R (z, k, b; ϕ)]θ [W L (z, k, b; ϕ)]1−θ

(22)

ϕ∈[0,1]

s.t.
W R (z, k, b; ϕ) ≥ 0,
W L (z, k, b; ϕ) ≥ 0.
Due to the general equilibrium nature of our problem, it is difficult to sign the effect of
changes of firm bargaining power (θ) on the fraction it repays lenders φ.19 Notice further that
18

As stated on p.
663 in Eraslan [18], “If no progress (in Chapter 11) is made toward agreement,
then the court can decide to convert the case to Chapter 7.”
See also “Conversion or Dismissal” at
www.uscourts.gov/FederalCourts/Bankruptcy/BankruptcyBasics/Chapter11.aspx.
19
Appendix A3.4 presents a set of experiments to understand the effects of changes in θ.

16

if θ = 1, then the lender’s surplus in (21) will be zero. In that case, an equilibrium with
positive debt where s7 k − c7 < 0 implies φ = 0 (i.e., if a firm with little capital has all the
bargaining power, it doesn’t repay debt in reorganization). However, if s7 k − c7 ≥ 0, then
even with θ = 1, creditors will receive some repayment (i.e., φ > 0). Thus, if high capital
firms with debt enter reorganization (something which happens in the data and under our
parameterization), then even if creditors have no bargaining it is possible that there will be
some payment in Chapter 11.

4.5

Household’s Problem

The first-order conditions for the household’s problem (8) and (9) are given by:


Bt+1 : qtB U 0 (Ct ) = βEt U 0 (Ct+1 )


Sjt+1 , ∀j : pjt U 0 (Ct ) = βEt U 0 (Ct+1 ) (pjt+1 + djt+1 ) .
In a steady state, this implies:
qtB = β

(23)

pjt = βEt [pjt+1 + djt+1 ] .

(24)

To characterize stock prices, consider the case of an incumbent firm and let p(z, k, b) =
V (z, k, b) − d(z, k, b). Then it is straightforward to show that (24) is equivalent to (10) or:
p(z, k, b)

=



βEz 0 |z p(z 0 , k 0 , b0 ) + d(z 0 , k 0 , b0 )

⇐⇒ V (z, k, b) − d(z, k, b) = (1 + r)−1 Ez 0 |z

(25)



V (z 0 , k 0 , b0 ) .

In the case of purchasing a stock of an entrant, SE = S 0 = S, in which case pj Sjt+1 and pj Sjt
cancel and the initial equity injection given by dE in (17) is accounted for in the household’s
budget set (9).
An implication of (25) is that firm optimization in a steady state implies:
(1 + r)−1 = β.

A stationary Markov equilibrium is a list V ∗ , w∗ , r∗ , q B∗ , q ∗ , φ∗ , p∗ , D7∗ , D11
such that:
1. Given w, r, q, and φ, the value function V ∗ is consistent with the firm’s optimization
problem in (12)-(15).
2. Given V, w, r, and q, the recovery rate φ∗ (k, b, z) solves the bargaining problem (22).
3. The probability of default Λ∗ in (18) and the sets Di∗ for i = 7, 11 are consistent with
firm decision rules.
4. The equilibrium loan price schedule is such that lenders earn zero profits in expected
value on each contract. That is, at q ∗ (b0 , k 0 , z), Ω∗ (b0 , k 0 , z) = 0 in (19).
5. The cost of creating a firm is such that VE∗ = 0 in (16).
6. Γ∗ (z, k, b) and M ∗ in (27) is a stationary measure of firms consistent with firm decision
rules and the law of motion for the stochastic variables.
7. Given w, q B , p, and taxes/tansfers T h , households solve (8) and (9), and (q B∗ , p∗ , r∗ ) are

A period is set to be one year. Conditional on issuing a positive amount of equity, we
parameterize equity issuance costs as a linear function, λ(x) = λ1 |x|. We assume that firm
productivity follows an AR(1) process:
log(zt ) = ρz log(zt−1 ) + ,
with |ρz | < 1 and  ∼ N (0, σ ). We use Tauchen’s procedure to discretize this process into an
11-state Markov process {z1 , . . . , z11 }.

21

In summary, our model has 21 parameters, which appear in Table 3. We divide them in two
sets. The first set (those above the line in Table 3), are set outside the model using standard
values in the literature or independent targets. Note that once we set the pre-tax, risk-free
rate r̃B = (1/q̃ B − 1), together with the income tax τi , equilibrium conditions determine β, r,
and q B . More specifically, β = q B = (1 + r)−1 = 1/(1 + r̃B (1 − τi )). The production function
parameters come from Atkeson and Kehoe [7]. Taxes are set following Hennessy and Whited
[22]. To estimate the parameters of the z process, we follow Cooper and Haltiwanger [15]. In
particular, taking logs of operating income (evaluated at optimal labor) and quasi-differencing
yields:
πit = ρz πit−1 + ηkit − ρz ηkit−1 + it ,
where η =

αν
1−(1−α)ν .

(40)

We estimate this equation for firms outside bankruptcy using a panel

fixed effect estimator with a complete set of dummies to capture year fixed-effects. The results
provide us with an estimate of ρz and σ .22 Finally, the value of assets during bankruptcy (c11
and c7 ), taken from Bris, et. al. [10], who present information on the value of assets after
bankruptcy conditional on whether the firm was liquidated or reorganized.
The parameters below the line in Table 3 are estimated by simulated method of moments
(SMM) that, in short, amount to minimizing the distance between model moments and data
moments (weighted by the optimal weighting matrix) selected to provide identification of the
model parameters. Our data moments come mostly from Compustat, which we presented in
Section 2. Specifically, the parameters are chosen to minimize:
Q(Θ) = [µd − µs (Θ)]0 W ∗ [µd − µs (Θ)],

(41)

with respect to parameters Θ, where µd are the moments from the data, µs (Θ), are the
moments from the simulated model at parameters Θ and W ∗ is a positive definite weighting

matrix.23 The covariance matrix of N (Θ̂ − Θ) is given by:

is the adjustment for simulation error.

Table 3 presents the parameter values and its standard errors.
22

Estimates are in line with those presented in the literature. See for example Cooper and Haltiwanger [15] and
Khan and Thomas [29].
23
In a first pass, we set W ∗ to the identity matrix (adjusting the moments by their data means to avoid putting
more weight on moments that are large in absolute value). We then estimate the optimal weighting matrix using the
inverse of the variance-covariance matrix of the simulated moments. Finally, with the optimal weighting matrix at
hand, we minimize (41) to estimate the parameters of the model and compute (42) to obtain their standard errors.
See Strebulaev and Whited ([38]) and references there for a comprehensive description of SMM estimation.

Note: Parameters below the line are set by minimizing the distance between
model moments and target moments. The entry cost κ is calibrated so it is consistent with the
equilibrium where the wage rate equals 1.

Before presenting the estimation outcome, we discuss the selection of these moments. Since
every moment that results from the model is a function of all parameters, there is no one-toone link between parameters and moments. However, we can point to moments that are more
informative to pin down a given parameter or set of parameters than others. The value of the
fixed operating cost cf is important for matching the exit rate. The cost of filing for Chapter 7
bankruptcy c7 is important for matching the recovery rate in Chapter 7 (as estimated in Bris,
et. al. [10]). The cost of filing for Chapter 11 c11 bankruptcy is important for matching the
fraction of Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The bargaining power of the firm once in reorganization θ
is important for matching the observed recovery rate in Chapter 11 (as estimated in Bris, et.
al. [10]). The equity issuance cost parameters λ1 and λ11
1 are set to match the median equity
issuance by non-bankrupt and Chapter 11 firms, respectively. The differential borrowing cost

23

of Chapter 11 firms λ11
b is selected to match the debt-to-asset ratio of firms in Chapter 11. The
net investment rate provides information on the adjustment cost parameter ψ. The scrap value
of capital sx is related to the bankruptcy rate. The entry cost κ is set so it is consistent with
an equilibrium where the wage rate is normalized to 1.24 Finally, we study an overidentified
model, and we also include the debt-to-asset ratio of non-bankrupt firms as well as the net
investment of Chapter 11 firms.
Given these parameter values, the moments we find in the model are given in Table 4.
Above the line, we show moments that were targets. Below the line we present some additional
moments.

In general, the model does a good job approximating the targeted moments. Among those
moments that were not targeted, the model generates a much larger net debt to assets and
overestimates the fraction of firms that issues equity for firms in reorganization. We do not

for a sample of firms in Compustat presented in Arellano, Bai, and Kehoe [5]. The spread is
defined as (1/q) − (1 + r). Note that, given that credit markets are competitive and lenders
are risk-neutral, after matching the bankruptcy rate, the recovery rate in Chapter 7, and the
recovery rate in Chapter 11 there is no room to improve on the average spread generated by
the model.25

We begin by describing decision rules concerning exit and bankruptcy choice. Figure 3 presents
the bankruptcy and exit decision rules across capital, debt, and productivity. The leftmost
panels present bankruptcy (top), exit conditional on not declaring bankruptcy (middle), and
exit conditional on declaring bankruptcy (i.e., whether to continue by reorganizing via Chapter
11 or exit by liquidating via Chapter 7, bottom) decision rules respectively, for a firm with
low productivity (z = zL ). The next two columns present the same decision rules for firms
with median and high productivity (z = zM and z = zH ), respectively. The blank regions in
the middle and bottom panels occur when the decision rule is not relevant. More specifically,
in states where a firm chooses to exit x(k, b, z) = 1 the decision rule for reorganization is not
shown. Similarly, in states where a firm chooses to stay x(k, b, z) = 0 the decision rule for
liquidation is not shown.
As evident in Figure 3, firms with high productivity (the rightmost column) do not exit no
matter what their mix of capital and debt. Some firms with high productivity and high debt
do however choose Chapter 11. At the other end of the spectrum (the leftmost column), for
firms with low productivity, those with (i) negative net debt (cash) and low capital choose to
exit without declaring bankruptcy, (ii) high debt and low capital choose Chapter 7, and (iii)
medium to high levels of capital choose to continue operating and, depending on their level
of debt-to-capital ratio, choose to reorganize or not. Qualitatively, median productivity firms
behave more like low productivity firms (since most options are chosen) than high productivity
firms (except those with negative net debt and low capital that choose to continue operating
as high productivity firms).
We next describe recovery rates under reorganization and bond prices offered to firms
conditional on how much they borrow (b0 ), what collateral they will have next period when they
have to repay (k 0 ), and their current productivity (z). Figure 4 graphs equilibrium recovery
rates (top panel) and price menus (bottom panel) offered to firms with median productivity.
As evident in Figure 4, for a given level of capital (which serves as collateral), the higher a
firm’s debt the less lenders recover, and, for a given level of debt, the higher a firm’s capital
the more lenders recover. Thus, firms with high debt to assets face higher real interest rates on
their borrowings. While not pictured, we also note that, since firms with low productivity are
more likely to go bankrupt (see Figure 3), for a given level of borrowing and collateral (b0 , k 0 ),
bond prices (interest rates) are increasing (decreasing) in firm-level productivity. Finally, note
that equilibrium interest rates observed in the economy depend not only on these menus but
also the equilibrium cross-sectional distribution of firms. Table 4 makes clear, for instance,
that the equilibrium average interest rate that non-bankrupt, non-exiting firms face is lower
(1.93%) than those faced by firms that are reorganizing (15.36%).

The average value of debt bM is derived from the stationary distribution of the model and equals 0.1642 (approximately 37% of average output).

Low productivity firms that are non-bankrupt/non-exiting choose to reduce their level of
debt or accumulate cash whenever they do not exit. On one hand, rolling over debt for these
low productivity firms is costly (since interest rates are high due to their elevated default risk).
On the other hand, the marginal product of capital is low, so reducing their level of capital to
pay off debt is optimal. Median productivity firms with low capital (where adjustment costs
reduce the marginal benefit of investment and borrowing costs are relatively high) or relatively
high capital (where the marginal product of capital is lower than low levels of capital due to
decreasing returns) choose to reduce their debt level as well. However, those with intermediate
levels of capital choose to increase their debt level in order to invest. Finally, most firms
with high productivity choose to increase their debt level since the high level of productivity
makes them less likely to declare bankruptcy and reduces borrowing costs, and the benefit of
investment is high.
The net cash flow e over assets of non-bankrupt firms is illustrated in Figure 6 (evaluated
at b = bM > 0, so total assets equal k). Recall that e > 0 denotes that the firm is distributing
dividends and that e < 0 denotes that the firm is issuing equity.

This figure shows that there are three regions that depend on the level of capital and
productivity of each firm. Firms with low productivity that do not exit do not find it profitable
to issue equity and do not pay dividends. Firms with median and high productivity choose to
issue equity when capital is relatively low in order to invest. High-productivity firms choose
to pay dividends since they can finance some of those dividend payments out of their positive
cash flow and borrowing at low interest rates.

28

The equilibrium cumulative distribution function of firms conditional on their productivity
is illustrated in Figure 7. It is evident that firms with low productivity are amassed on lower
capital and debt levels, while those with high productivity are amassed on higher capital and
debt levels.

Event Analysis: Reorganization

Next, we study dynamics around bankruptcy events both in the model and the data. This
allows us to describe the dynamics of the model and provides a natural “test” of the model since
we do not estimate parameters to match the dynamics. We start by depicting the evolution
around a bankruptcy that results in reorganization. Figure 8 shows a set of charts based
on the simulated data of the model (Panels (i), (iii), (v), and (vii)) and the data (Panels
(ii), (iv), (vi), and (viii)). The plots show 11-year event windows (from t = −5 to t = 5)
centered on the year of bankruptcy (t = 0). Solid lines represent the average of the variable in
each panel and dotted lines to a +/− 1 standard deviation across all firms that went through
reorganization. Figure 8, Panels (i) and (ii) show the debt-to-asset ratio, Panels (iii) and (iv)
the debt interest rate, Panels (v) and (vi) the sales-to-asset ratio, and Panels (vii) and (viii)

Note: In the data, events are constructed using firms that go through only one reorganization during the duration
of the event analysis. Appendix A1 presents a detailed description of the construction of the variables.

Focusing on the model dynamics, we note that the increase in the sales-to-asset ratio (Panel
(v)) prior to bankruptcy derives from a rapid increase in productivity (that outpaces the growth
of assets). Panel (i) shows that, pre-bankruptcy, the debt-to-asset ratio also increases sharply.
The firm borrows to invest as the marginal product of capital increases. Interest rates (Panel

available a measure of debt interest rate at the firm level. For that reason, as a proxy, we use the ratio of interest
payments to total debt.

(iii)) remain close to the risk-free level (t = −5, −4, −3) while the growth rate of the debtto-assets ratio stays relatively low (since most debt is fully collateralized and the bankruptcy
probability is close to zero). However, further increases in the leverage ratio (t = −2, −1)
result in a jump in the bankruptcy probability that is reflected in a similar jump in the
average interest rate that firms pay. Interest rates do not increase as much as the bankruptcy
probability since the expected recovery rate for lenders is positive. Post-bankruptcy, firms
reduce their leverage ratio, the sales-to-asset ratio also decreases, and the investment rate
remains below the levels observed prior to bankruptcy.
Figure 8 shows that the model is consistent with the dynamics of the debt-to-asset ratio, interest rates, and the investment rate observed in the data (the debt-to-asset ratio increases prior
to bankruptcy and declines abruptly during the bankruptcy, the interest rate increases close to
bankruptcy, and the investment rate declines sharply when the firm enters bankruptcy). However, the model overpredicts how fast the firm reduces its debt-to-asset ratio after bankruptcy,
overestimates the increase in the sales-to-asset ratio prior to bankruptcy and its decline post
bankruptcy, and predicts a slower improvement in the investment rate than in the data.

6.3

Event Analysis: Liquidation

In this section, we describe a bankruptcy event that results in liquidation. As before, we
present the evolution of the variables for the model and the data. Figure 9 show 5-year event
windows that end the year of liquidation at t = 0. Solid lines represent the average of the
variable in each panel and dotted lines to a +/− 1 standard deviation (across all firms that
exit via liquidation). Panels (i) and (ii) show the debt to asset ratio, Panels (iii) and (iv) the
debt interest rate, Panels (v) and (vi) the sales-to-asset ratio, and Panels (vii) and (viii) the
net-investment-to-asset ratio.
A liquidation event is the result of a slow decline in productivity as is evident from the
decline in sales to assets (Panel (v)). Investment declines (Panel (vii)) to the point where the
firm is actually reducing its level of capital. The leverage ratio remains constant for most of
the event (Panel (i)), implying that the level of debt is also diminishing. Interest rates jump
the year prior to the bankruptcy, together with a significant increase in debt-to-asset ratio
that derives mostly from the fact that during this period the firm deploys its level of capital
(the investment rate is close to -1). Note that since the firm is liquidated with a debt level
that is above the residual value of capital, limited liability binds and the recovery rate is close
to 0.
When comparing the dynamics of the model and the data, we observe that the model
is qualitatively consistent with the evolution of the leverage ratio, sales-to-assets, and net
investment. The model overpredicts the increase in the leverage ratio in the final period and
the interest rate the year prior to liquidation.

Policy Counterfactual: A Fresh Start for Firms

In our counterfactual experiment, we analyze a variant of the bankruptcy procedure proposed
by Aghion, Hart, and Moore [2], which itself is related to Bebchuk [8]. In particular, their
proposal consists of three simple steps: (i) When a firm goes bankrupt, a fraction (1 − ϕ) of
the firm’s existing debts are canceled (Aghion, et. al. take ϕ = 0); (ii) bids are solicited for the
“new”, all equity firm and rights to the equity in this new firm are allocated among the former
claim holders (applying absolute priority rule, first to bond holders, then to former equity

32

holders);28 (iii) the new shareholders – that is, the former claim holders – decide whether to
continue the all equity firm or exit. After these steps, the firm exits from bankruptcy.29 A
similar proposal has recently been suggested by the American Bankruptcy Institute.30
At the beginning of the period, the firm decides whether to declare bankruptcy (∆ = 1)
or not (∆ = 0). If it decides not to default, the firm repays its debt and decides whether to
continue (x = 0) or not (x = 1). If it decides to default, the procedure described above is
triggered.
As before, the value of the firm is given by:
V (z, k, b) = max V∆ (z, k, b),

(43)

V∆=0 (z, k, b) = max V0x (z, k, b),

(44)

∆∈{0,1}

where as before:
x∈{0,1}

but now V∆=1 (z, k, b) must be consistent with the process outlined in the new bankruptcy
procedure.
Specifically, a firm that does not declare bankruptcy and chooses not to exit will decide its
optimal level of investment and borrowing as before:

To further understand how this reform affects the economy, in Appendix A3.3 we study the normative effects of a
reform that gets rid of Chapter 11 and in Appendix A3.4 we describe the results of reforms that affect the estimated
bargaining weight by changing θ to 0.01 and to 0.99.
30
Consistent with the policy recommendation in Aghion, et. al. [2], Stech [37] writes about the American
Bankruptcy Institute proposal “Under the proposed changes, a bankruptcy judge would estimate the reorganization value of a company once it files for Chapter 11 protection. The bankrupt company could reorganize and leave
Chapter 11 by paying that amount to a senior lender, even if that lender’s debt has a larger face value.” For the full
report, see American Bankruptcy Institute [4].

where cB is the bankruptcy cost and W (z, k, ϕb) is the value of the “new” firm after a fraction
1−ϕ of its original debts have been canceled. This value captures the fact that the new owners
of the firm have the option to either continue operating the firm or liquidate it and is given

One important aspect of this counterfactual is the pricing of debt. The bankruptcy set is given
by:
D1 (k, b) =



z ∈ Z : ∆(z, k, b) = 1 .

In this case, we can write the lender’s profit function as follows:

In equilibrium, the lender’s profits must be zero.
As in our benchmark, we solve for a general equilibrium (i.e., wages adjust to clear the
labor market) under the new bankruptcy policy. In Appendix A3.5, we decompose the effects
of the reform into those that would arise in a partial equilibrium setting (where the wage rate
stays constant and does not adjust to satisfy the free entry condition) to compare the general
equilibrium results. While there are not sizeable differences between the two, we find that the
partial equilibrium model would overpredict the impact on the bankruptcy rate (8% higher
under partial equilibrium than under general equilibrium) and spreads (12% higher).
Aggregate consumption in this economy is again given by the resource constraint (29),

Notice that the key essential difference between the proposed bankruptcy reform and that of
the current law is that absolute priority rule is applied in all cases in the proposal while it is
only applied in Chapter 7 currently. This can have a big impact on recovery rates and the
pricing of debt. In particular, in return for debt forgiveness the creditors receive an all-equity
firm without having to go through a bargaining process. This alters recovery rates in (50) and
hence interest rate menus that firms face. This will have important implications for capital
structure and firm dynamics.
In our main experiment, we set ϕ = 0 as proposed by Aghion, et. al. [2], the bankruptcy
costs and the price of capital equal to those estimated for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in our benchmark economy (i.e., cB = c7 and sB = s7 ).32 Table 5 presents a comparison across the two
steady states.
31

To save on notation, the first expression uses the fact that a firm will never pay back debt and issue equity when
it exits.
32
Appendix A3.2 shows the results from experiments where {cB , sB } = {c11 , s7 } as well as {cB , sB } = {c11 , s11 }.
Using different bankruptcy costs affects the resulting bankruptcy rate (decreases with the value of cB ), but the main
results of the paper (capital structure of firms and welfare) are robust to the different specifications of bankruptcy
costs.

Notes: In the benchmark, liquidation (Chapter 7) refers to (∆ = 1, x = 1), while reorganization (Chapter 11) refers
to (∆ = 1, x = 0). In the reform, liquidation refers to ∆ = 1 and V (z, k, 0) < sk, while reorganization refers to
∆ = 1 and V (z, k, 0) ≥ sk.

The reform results in a considerable reduction of the bankruptcy rate and a jump in the
fraction of bankruptcy via reorganization (via the new policy) while leaving the exit rate
almost unaffected. While the fraction of firms that reorganize after going bankrupt increases,
the overall fraction of firms that are reorganized after the reform drops since the reduction in
the bankruptcy rate dominates. We also observe an increase in the debt-to-asset ratio for nonbankrupt and bankrupt firms (larger in the case of those firms that reorganize than in those
that do not). There is a significant rise of the lender’s recovery rate after reorganization that
is reflected in the reduction of spreads for firms that decide to continue after going through
bankruptcy.
To understand the differences between the benchmark and reform economies, we begin by
comparing the interest rate menus in both cases. The reform allows firms to access better

36

credit terms and reduces the need for the firm to hold as much capital (collateral against
loans). Figure 10 presents the price schedule for both cases (Panel (i) our benchmark and
Panel (ii) the counterfactual economy, both evaluated at median productivity z = zM ).

Bond prices q(k 0 , b0 , z) ∈ [0, (1 + r)−1 ].

Figure 10 makes clear that, at any given level of (b0 , k 0 ), prices are higher in the reform
economy than in our benchmark. This derives from the fact, with a more “lender” friendly
economy, at a given

b
k,

the expected recovery rate goes up (and in fact is increasing in

b
k ),

allowing the firm to borrow at lower interest rates ceteris paribus.
The resultant shift in the interest rate menu has two effects: (i) firms are willing to borrow
more in order to invest (debt-to-asset and net debt-to-asset ratios increase for both nonbankrupt and bankrupt firms); and (ii) they need to hold less collateral in order to sustain
a given level of investment (this results in a reduction in the aggregate and average level of
capital). These two effects are easily observed in Figure 11, which graph the distribution of
debt to assets.

debt/assets

Consistent with Figure 11, Table 5 documents a 26% increase in borrowing (relative to
assets) for non-bankrupt firms. Everything else equal, the shift in the price schedule from
the benchmark to the reform economy would imply a sizeable reduction in interest rates.
However, the increase in the amount firms borrow actually results in a slight increase in the
average interest rate paid by non-bankrupt firms (2.0% versus 2.01%). Firms that reorganize
under the reform have a “fresh start” since they operate with no debt during the bankruptcy
procedure. In equilibrium, the realized recovery rate for lenders when a firm reorganizes
increases to 88.04% (leverage ratios increase by more than 100% for reorganized firms), and
the recovery rate for firms that are liquidated also increases (but this is not as relevant for
firm dynamics since almost no firm is liquidated after bankruptcy post-reform). These capital
structure decisions impact net investment to assets. There is a 20% increase in investment
rates for non-bankrupt firms and a sharp reduction in investment rates for those firms that
are reorganized. Capital levels for non-bankrupt and bankrupt firms decline considerably after
the reform as a consequence of changes in firm dynamics to be described below. As Figure 12
shows, after the reform, there is a considerable reduction in the fraction of firms that operate
in the “inaction” region (i.e., firms operating with investment rates close to 0%).33
33

The lower capital levels (which are the main component of assets) also account for some of the rise in investmentto-asset ratios.

investment rate (i/k)

Table 5 also documents that, while the fraction of firms declaring bankruptcy decreases
significantly (from 0.88% to 0.43%), the fraction of firms exiting falls much more modestly (-5%
approximately). Firm reorganization conditional on going bankrupt (via ownership change and
debt forgiveness) increases considerably (by 55%). However, the reduction in the bankruptcy
rate more than compensates this increase and results in an overall lower fraction of firms
being reorganized after the reform. The total mass of firms depends directly on the fraction
of entrants that survive over time. The reform economy exhibits a lower mass of entrants M
(3% smaller) but the reduction in exit rates results in a higher total mass of firms after the
reform than in the benchmark (an increase of 1.8%). There are several effects at work here
that depend on firm dynamics to be described below. First, for a given mass of entrants,
since the exit rate declines the total mass of firms will increase in equilibrium. Second, in
the opposite direction, since the average size of the firm declines, average labor demand also
declines (which is somewhat offset by a general equilibrium increase in wages). The first of
the two effects dominates so aggregate labor demand increases and a lower mass of entrants is
needed in equilibrium in order to clear the labor market.
The effects of the reform on the life cycle of firms can be computed for a given cohort of
firms.34 Figure 13 shows the survival, exit and bankruptcy probabilities for a given cohort of
firms under the benchmark and after the bankruptcy reform. This figure makes evident that
34

To track the evolution of a given cohort of firms, we start with a mass of firms M and follow them over time
(age) using equation (27) with no entry after the initial period. Statistics presented are conditional on firm age.

39

a firm is less likely to survive in the benchmark than after the reform. However, a firm is less
likely to declare bankruptcy late in its life cycle after the reform. Fewer firms enter (there is
3% decline in M ) but entrants are bigger in the reform economy (see Figure 14) since they
face better credit terms. The reduction in exit rates early in the life cycle of the firm generates
a lower average productivity for young firms post-reform. There is less cleansing at the lower
end of the productivity distribution after the reform (since firms with lower productivity are
able and willing to borrow in order to continue). The increase in the bankruptcy rate in the
initial period is the result of the higher debt-to-asset ratio observed in newly created firms
(borrowing increases by 36% and the debt-to-asset ratio by 26%). The lower exit rate after
the reform implies that in a steady-state average age is higher in the reform economy than in
the benchmark.

Figure 14 shows the evolution of net investment relative to assets, firm size (capital), and
productivity over the firm’s life cycle. Entrants’ size rises (by 8%) as the size of young incumbent firms (age ≤ 3 years). Borrowing levels for young firms also increase (by approximately
36%). While the stochastic process for technology shocks does not change across experiments,
Figure 14 shows that after entry it is more likely for young, less productive firms to survive

40

under the reform. Incentives to exit or go bankrupt are stronger for firms with low productivity
in the benchmark economy. Since firms are offered better credit terms after the reform, as we
show in Figure 15, firms are able to start larger, sustain higher leverage ratios, and reduce on
equity issuance. Selection effects result in lower average productivity for young firms in the
economy under the new bankruptcy regime. The productivity differential vanishes as firms
aged (at age 18 average productivity is the same before and after the reform, and at age 30
productivity is 0.1% higher for firms after the reform). However, since firms previous to the
reform slowly continue to grow and accumulate capital, the average size of old firms prior
to the reform is larger than those after the reform. Moreover, as we discuss next, allocative
efficiency improves with the new bankruptcy regime.

The capital structure decisions that support the above investment choices are given in
Figure 15. The figure shows that mature firms sustain a higher debt-to-asset ratio and lower

We also explore the implications of the reform for firms of different sizes. Table 6 presents
summary statistics conditional on firm size when size is measure by total assets. We focus on
the bottom 5% and the top 5% of the firm size distribution.
The exit rate decreases modestly after the reform when looking at all firms in the economy.
However, there is a very significant reduction in the exit rate for the bottom 5%. Small
firms that are liquidated or exit after the reform are much less productive (-10%) after the
reform than in the benchmark. This reduces the positive impact of the bankruptcy reform
on aggregate productivity since relatively low productivity firms are kept alive. Also in the
bottom 5%, we uncover a large reduction in the bankruptcy rate and, among the firms that go
bankrupt, a large shift from liquidation to reorganization. The reduction in the bankruptcy
rate and the shift from liquidation to reorganization (with the corresponding increase in the
realized recovery rate for the lender) results in a large drop in spreads (from 5.23% to 0.34%).
The reduction in bankruptcy rates is also present at the top of the distribution. In this group,
prior to the reform, all bankrupt firms were reorganized. After the reform, since bankruptcy
also implies a change in ownership, large and productive firms operate in a region where default
risk is absent. Both at the top and at the bottom of the distribution, we observe an increase
in the debt-to-asset and net-debt-to-asset ratio after the reform. The increase in allocative
efficiency, as measured by the covariance between productivity and share of output, increases
by 12% at the bottom of the distribution and by 8% at the top. This is also reflected in an
increase in output weighted productivity that is more significant at the bottom than at the

42

top (+1.8% and +0.4%, respectively).

Notes: In the benchmark, liquidation (Chapter 7) refers to (∆ = 1, x = 1) while reorganization (Chapter 11) refers
to (∆ = 1, x = 0). In the reform, liquidation refers to ∆ = 1 and V (z, k, 0) < sk while reorganization refers to ∆ = 1
and V (z, k, 0) ≥ sk. Size bins derived from asset distribution (e.g., bottom 5% corresponds to firms in the bottom

The positive effects in Table 5 have implications for household welfare (aggregate consumption), which is presented in Table 7.35

Because we consider steady-state equilibria and we have a representative household, there are no transition

Note: Benchmark Model in levels, bankruptcy reform column presents the percent deviation from
the benchmark model. z is average firm productivity, zb is the (output weighted) average
firm-level productivity, and ω is the output share of each firm.

Table 7 shows that, even though output decreases slightly (-0.04%), consumption increases
(+0.54%) as the result of the reduction in adjustment costs (-5.49%), equity issuance costs (84.32%), and bankruptcy costs (-100%) together with the increase in the exit value (+26.38%).
Better credit terms are also the driver of lower equity issuance (reducing the need to issue equity
in order to finance investment); also, since after the reform firms that reorganize change owners,
they do not need to either issue debt or equity in order to pay for bankruptcy costs (paid for
by the previous owners). The change in the price schedule reduces the need to hold capital
as a way to reduce borrowing costs (since it works as collateral), inducing a reduction in the
aggregate level of capital and investment. This change at the individual firm is counteracted
by the increase in the total mass of firms after the reform (+1.8%). However, the first effect
dominates. The 3.5% increase in total entry costs E in Table 7 is all due to the increase in
the size of the entrants discussed before. The lower entry rate after the reform results in a
reduction in the mass of entrants (-2.8%) that is not enough to reverse the changes in initial

44

capital. While the aggregate results are relatively modest, they are in line with recent papers
that have analyzed the role of financial frictions on aggregate productivity, consumption, and
welfare. For example, Midrigan and Xu [31] find that changes in borrowing limits predict
fairly small efficiency losses from capital misallocation (close to 0.4%) and negligible changes
in consumption. In another related paper, Moll [33] argues that, if shocks are persistent (as
in our benchmark calibration), steady-state losses due to financial frictions are small since
entrepreneurs can potentially overcome them through the accumulation of internal funds.
An important aspect of the bankruptcy reform is that it improves the allocation of resources
in the economy. Table 7 shows that measured aggregate TFP rises by 0.43%. In order to explain
this change and to provide a measure that captures how efficiently resources are allocated in
the economy, we use a decomposition of weighted average firm-level productivity proposed
originally by Olley and Pakes [34]:
Z
zb ≡

K×B

X

zj ωj dj = [z + cov(z, ω)],

z

where zb is the average of firm-level productivity weighted by output share, ωj is the output
R
P
share of each firm j, and z is the unweighted mean productivity (i.e., K×B z zΓ(dk, db, z)).
That is, output weighted productivity can be decomposed into two terms: the unweighted
average of firm-level productivity and a covariance term between output shares and productivity. A larger value for the covariance term captures an improvement in allocative efficiency.
Table 7 shows the values for this decomposition. We observe that while average (unweighted)
productivity decreases slightly (-0.02%) in the reform economy (this is due to the lower exit
rate and weaker selection for young firms), average weighted productivity in the economy increases (+0.44%) since the increase in the covariance between output shares and productivity
(better allocative efficiency) more than compensates (+2.58%) for the reduction in average
(unweighted) productivity.36 In sum, after the reform, a larger fraction of production is placed
with more productive firms. The change in credit terms between the benchmark and the
reform economy allows firms to operate at a more efficient scale, so the correlation between
capital stock and productivity increases.

Conclusion

We extend a standard model of firm dynamics to incorporate Chapter 7 and Chapter 11
bankruptcy choices. We find that, if reforms proposed by legal and economic scholars are
followed, there can be significant changes in borrowing costs, capital structure, and investment decisions as well as the cross-sectional distribution of firms. The general equilibrium
36

That is, by weaker selection we mean that less (more) low productivity firms exit (survive).

consequences of such reforms can lead to a rise in consumer welfare and allocative efficiency.

Data

We use data from Compustat North America Fundamentals Annual.37 Our choice of firm
identifier is GVKEY. The sample period for the fundamentals data ranges from 1980 to 2012.
Our year variable is extracted from the variable DATADATE. We exclude financial firms with
SIC codes between 6000 and 6999, utility firms with SIC codes between 4900 and 4999, and
firms with SIC codes greater than 9000 (residual categories). Observations are deleted if they
do not have a positive book value of assets or if gross capital stock or sales are zero, negative,
or missing. We censorize the top and bottom 2% of the ratios we construct, as in Henessy
and Whited [23]. The final sample is an unbalanced panel with more than 12,000 firms and
117,746 firm/year observations. All nominal variables are deflated using the Consumer Price
Index (CPI) index (normalized to 100 in 1983). See Tables A1 and A2.

Identifying Exit and Bankruptcies
We document firm exit, Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and Chapter 7 bankruptcy using a set
of different sources. We code a firm/year observation as being in Chapter 11 bankruptcy
whenever the following happens:
• Footnote to total assets in period t+1 reports code “AG” (reflects adoption of fresh-start
accounting upon emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy).
• Footnote to total assets in period t reports code “TL” (company in bankruptcy or liquidation) and the bankruptcy event does not lead to firm deletion.
• Footnote to total assets in period t reports code “TL” (company in bankruptcy or liquidation), the bankruptcy event leads to firm deletion, and the variable DLRSN (research company reason for deletion) is equal to codes 01 (acquisition or merger), 02
(BBankruptcy), 04 (reverse acquisition), 07 (other, no longer files with SEC among other
possible reasons, but pricing continues), 09 (now a private company) and 10 (other, no
longer files with SEC among other possible reasons).
• If the firm/year observation corresponds to the last period of the firm in our sample, the
variable DLRSN (research company reason for deletion) is equal to code 02 (bankruptcy),
and the footnote to assets does not contain bankruptcy information.
To complement the set of Chapter 11 bankruptcies that we find using Compustat and dates
from the footnote of total assets, we use Chapter 11 bankruptcy dates provided for firms with
assets worth 100 million or more (in 1980 US$) available in the UCLA-LoPucki Bankruptcy
Research Database.

51

We code a firm/year observation as being in Chapter 7 bankruptcy whenever the following
happens:
• Footnote to total assets in period t reports code “TL” (company in bankruptcy or liquidation); the bankruptcy event leads to firm deletion and the variable DLRSN (research
company reason for deletion) is equal to code 03 (liquidation).
• If the firm/year observation corresponds to the last period of the firm in our sample, the
variable DLRSN (research company reason for deletion) is equal to code 03 (Liquidation)
and the footnote to assets does not contain bankruptcy information.
The classification into Chapter 11 and Chapter 7 bankruptcy during the last period of the firm
in the sample is the same used by Duffie, Saita and Wang [17].
To be consistent with the definition of Chapter 11 bankruptcy, a deleted firm (i.e., a firm
that disappears from our sample) is counted as a firm exit if the variable DLRSN is not equal
to codes 01, 02, 04, 07, 09, or 10 (i.e., those not identified as continuing firms due to mergers,
reorganization or because they go private for example). That implies that we classify a deletion
as exit if the code equals code 02 (liquidation) or codes 11 through 14 or if the code is missing.
This is consistent with the definition of exit that the U.S. Census Bureau uses to construct
its exit statistics. Table A3 provides summary statistics about the frequency of each of the
above codes. Using this information, we have 173,617 non-bankrupt firm/year observations,
1,319 Chapter 11 firm/year observations, and 315 Chapter 7 firm/year observations. Table A3
presents a set of summary statistics. Moments in this table are computed as the time series
average of the corresponding cross-sectional statistic.

acquisitions. Source: Compustat Fundamentals (WRDS).

In Table 1 (see Section 2), we include tests of the differences between means. To do so, for

52

each variable of interest xt (i.e., variables listed in Table 1), we run the following regressions:
xit = a0 + a1 dch11
+ a2 dch7
it
it + bt + uit ,

(A.1.1)

where dch11
is a dummy variable that takes value 1 if the firm/year observation corresponds to
it
the start of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy and zero otherwise; dch7
it is a dummy variable that takes
value 1 if the firm/year observation corresponds to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and zero otherwise;
and bt corresponds to a full set of year fixed effects. A significant coefficient a1 reflects that
average xt is significantly different for firms in Chapter 11 bankruptcy than that of nonbankrupt firms. Similarly, a significant coefficient a2 reflects that average xt is significantly
different for firms in Chapter 7 bankruptcy than that of non-bankrupt firms. To test whether
that average of xt is significantly different for firms in Chapter 7 than for those in Chapter 11,
we run a similar regression using only observations in Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 and using
ch7
as a regressor dch7
it and time fixed effects. A significant dit coefficient reflects means between

these two groups are significantly different.
z-scores and Distance to Default
The Altman z-score is a commonly used measure of the level of distress of corporations
(see Altman [3] for the seminal paper on the subject). The basic idea is to construct an index
based on observable variables that helps to predict whether a firm is close to bankruptcy or
not. More specifically, the z−score is defined as follows:
z = 1.2x1 + 1.4x2 + 3.3x3 + 0.6x4 + 0.999x5 ,
where x1 is the working-capital-to-total-asset ratio (measured as current assets minus current
liabilities over assets), x2 is retained earnings over assets, x3 corresponds to the earnings before
interest and taxes over assets, x4 is the market value of equity over the book value of total
liabilities and x5 is sales over total assets. The coefficients are determined using a multiple
discriminant statistical method. Once the z-score is constructed, the rule of thumb is to define
all firms having a z-score greater than 2.99 as “non-distressed” firms and those firms having
a z-score below 1.81 as “distressed” firms. The area between 1.81 and 2.99 is defined as the
“zone of ignorance.”
In order to construct a default probability based on the distance-to-default model, we
follow Duffie et. al [17]. The default probability is constructed using the number of standard
deviations of asset growth by which a firm’s market value of assets exceeds a liability measure.
That is, for a given firm, the 1-year horizon distance to default is defined as:
Dt =

2)
ln(Vt /Lt ) + (µA − 1/2σA
,
σA

53

where Vt is the market value of the firm’s assets at time t, and Lt is the liability measure
(calculated as short-term book debt plus 1/2 of long-term book debt), µA is the mean rate of
asset growth and σA the standard deviation of asset growth.
The market value of the firm is estimated following the theory of Merton (1974) and Black
and Scholes (1973). More specifically, we let Wt denote the market value of equity which is
equal to an option on the value of a firm’s assets, currently valued at Vt , with strike price of
Lt and one year to expiration. We obtain the asset value Vt and the volatility of asset growth
by solving the following system of equations iteratively:
Wt = Vt Φ(d1 ) − Lt er Φ(d2 ),
σa = Std.Dev.(ln(Vt ) − ln(Vt−1 ),
2)
ln(Vt /Lt ) + (r + 1/2σA
d1 =
,
σA
d2 = d1 − σA ,
where Φ(·) is the standard normal cdf, Std. Dev. denotes standard deviation and r is the
risk-free rate (that we take to be the real 1-year T-bill rate). The initial guess for Vt is the
sum of Wt (measured as end-of-period real stock price times number of shares outstanding)
and the book value of total debt (sum of short-term and long-term book debt). Once Vt and
σA are estimated, we compute Dt . The corresponding default probability is
pD
t = Φ(−Dt ).
Construction of Bankruptcy Events
In order to construct bankruptcy events, we restrict the sample to bankruptcies that happened between the years 1985 and 2010, so the entire window of any given event falls within
our sample. Our sample contains not only firms with one event during their existence but also
firms with more than one bankruptcy. We also found that events that are identified as Chapter
11 bankruptcies sometimes lead to the deletion of the firm from the sample (for example, due
to changes in organizational structure or mergers). We proceed as follows:
• We ignore any event of a firm that goes into Chapter 11 the same year that it is removed
from the sample (since we do not have information post-bankruptcy and these events are
not classified as Chapter 7 bankruptcies).
• If a firm goes into bankruptcy more than once during its existence, we only use the
events where a bankruptcy is not followed by another bankruptcy within the window of
the event (i.e., as long as a new bankruptcy does not happen in periods t = 1, 2, 3, 4, or
5 of the event under consideration).
• We eliminate outliers by filtering out the top 1% and the bottom 1% of each of the

54

variables reported.
• Standard deviations reported correspond to the cross-section deviation for those firms
under analysis.

Computational Algorithm

In this section, we describe our computational algorithm.
1. Set grids for k ∈ K, b ∈ B, and z ∈ Z.
2. Guess initial wage rate w0 , price schedule q 0 (k 0 , b0 , z), and recovery rate schedule φ0 (k 0 , b0 , z).
3. Solve Firm Problem: Given the bond price schedule, recovery schedule, and wage
rate, solve the firm problem to obtain capital, debt, exit, and bankruptcy decision rules
as well as value functions.
4. Update Recovery Schedule: Using the value functions obtained in step 3, solve the
renegotiation problem to obtain φ1 (k 0 , b0 , z).
5. Update Bond Price Schedule: Using the exit and bankruptcy decision rules, obtain
a price function that is consistent with them. Let it be q 1 (k 0 , b0 , z).
6. If ||φ1 (k, b, z) − φ0 (k, b, z)|| < φ and ||q 1 (k 0 , b0 , z) − q 0 (k 0 , b0 , z)|| < q , for small φ and
q , then we have obtained the equilibrium price and recovery schedule (for a given price
w0 ), continue to the next step. If not, update the price and recovery schedule (i.e., set
φ0 = φ1 and q 0 = q 1 ) and return to step 3.
7. Update wage using free entry condition: Evaluate the free entry condition V E at
w0 . If it holds with equality, continue. If it does not, proceed as follows:
• If V E is positive, increase w0 and return to step 3.
• If V E is negative, reduce w0 and return to step 3.
8. Derive Equilibrium Mass of Firms from Labor Market Clearing:
• Set M = 1 and compute the stationary distribution associated with the set of decision rules obtained above and this mass of entrants. Denote this distribution
Γ̂(k, b, z; M = 1).
• Calculate labor demand Γ̂(k, b, z; M = 1), that is:
Z
N̂ (M = 1) =

n(z, k, b)dΓ̂(z, k, b; M = 1).

• Set M 0 to satisfy the labor market clearing condition. That is, set M 0 as follows:
M 0 = 1/N̂ (M = 1).

55

• The equilibrium prices and distribution are: w∗ = w0 , M ∗ = M 0 , Γ∗ = M ∗ Γ̂(k, b, z; M =
1), q ∗ = q 0 ,φ∗ = φ0 .
• Aggregates and Taxes: Compute aggregate consumption and taxes.

∆ = 1 and W 0 (z, k, 0) ≥ sk.

Table A4 shows that the changes in firm dynamics and the capital structure of firms after
the reform in this case, where the entry cost is measured in labor units, are similar to our
benchmark economy, where the entry cost is a resource cost to the economy. Table A5 shows
that the aggregate results are robust to this change in the environment.

As in our benchmark economy, after the bankruptcy reform output declines slightly but
consumption increases due to the reduction in adjustment costs, equity issuance costs and
bankruptcy costs.

Alternative Bankruptcy Costs

In this appendix, we compare our benchmark with the results of our main bankruptcy reform
where {cB , sB } = {c7 , s7 } and those that arise if bankruptcy costs are set as {cB , sB } =
{c11 , s7 } as well as {cB , sB } = {c11 , s11 }. Tables A6 and A7 present the comparison across the
equilibria.

Table A6 shows that the exit rate is barely affected by changes in the value of bankruptcy
costs. However, the bankruptcy rate is significant smaller after reforms where the cost is set
to cB = c11 (this is also reflected in the sharp reduction in spreads). Under all reforms, the
debt-to-asset ratio of non-bankrupt firms increase. Table A7 makes evident that the variation
in bankruptcy rates does not affect the aggregate results. After all reforms, output decreases
slightly but consumption increases due to the reduction in adjustment costs, equity issuance
costs, and bankruptcy costs. Allocative efficiency also increases in all experiments.

A3.3

Reform No Chapter 11

In this appendix, we compare our benchmark with the results of our main bankruptcy reform
and those that arise after a reform that eliminates Chapter 11 reorganization. We imple-

60

ment this experiment by increasing the cost of Chapter 11 in our benchmark economy to a
prohibitively high number. Tables A8 and A9 present the comparison across the equilibria.

average firm productivity, zb is the (output weighted) average
firm level productivity, and ω is the output share of each firm.

Table A8 shows that when Chapter 11 reorganization is not available the exit rate increases and the bankruptcy rate is largely reduced. The fraction of firms that is liquidated
after bankruptcy (Chapter 7) is barely affected (0.241 in the benchmark versus 0.25 after the
reform). The debt-to-asset ratio increases (as was the case under our main bankruptcy reform analyzed). Table A9 makes evident that eliminating Chapter 11 results in lower output
(-0.20%, also consistent with the reduction in wages) but higher consumption (+0.48%) due
to lower adjustment costs, equity issuance costs, and bankruptcy costs.

A3.4

Sensitivity Analysis: Bargaining Weights

In this section, we present a sensitivity analysis with respect to the parameter controlling the
bargaining weight (θ). By moving this parameter, we can also understand how the bankruptcy
reform compares with reforms that would give the borrower more or less bargaining power than
the benchmark value. Tables A10 and A11 present the comparison across the equilibria.

Decomposition: General Equilibrium vs Partial

Equilibrium
This section presents the results of the counterfactual experiments absent general equilibrium
effects (i.e., the wage rate stays constant and does not adjust to satisfy the free entry condition).
Table A12 shows the comparison of the effects of the reform under general equilibrium (GE)
and partial equilibrium (PE).

Notes: GE correspond to solution of general equilibrium model (i.e., the wage rate adjusts to clear the labor market).
PE corresponds to the solution of the partial equilibrium model (i.e., wage rate stays constant). Liquidation (Chapter
7) refers to (∆ = 1, x = 1) while reorganization (Chapter 11) refers to (∆ = 1, x = 0).
