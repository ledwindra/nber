ABSTRACT
The paper presents a new empirical regularity between the volatility of productivity growth and long-run
unemployment, for a given level of long-run productivity growth. A theoretical framework based on
asymmetric real wage rigidities is shown to have the potential to rationalize this finding. The model
tends to fit U.S. long-run unemployment better than a specification based on long-run productivity
growth only, especially during the Great Moderation and the Great Recession.

Introduction

The recent …nancial crisis has brought unemployment back to the front page of policy
and academic research agendas. An unusual feature of the most recent U.S. experience
is that the persistent rise in unemployment has not been associated with a persistent
fall in productivity growth. This pattern is interesting because it contrasts with a more
standard negative relationship between low-frequency movements in unemployment and
productivity growth over most of the post-WWII period, with notable exceptions during
the second half of the 1980s and the late 2000s.1 (This pattern is visible in the …rst column
of Figure 1 using methods described below.2 )
This paper shows how this apparent inconsistency can be resolved by uncovering the
presence of an additional relationship. Indeed, the second column of the …gure reveals
another intriguing feature of the data: there exists a positive association between longrun unemployment and the variance of productivity growth. The latter relationship seems
particularly strong during the aforementioned periods in which the …rst relation is weak:
the second half of the 1980s and the late 2000s. For instance, the Great Moderation in the
volatility of productivity growth coincides with a sharp fall in the trend of unemployment.
In the econometric analysis below, we con…rm that this tight positive relationship holds
over and above the negative link between unemployment and productivity growth in the
long-run, thereby suggesting a key e¤ect of macroeconomic volatility on unemployment.
Consistent with the prima facie evidence in Figure 1 and the econometric evidence in
the rest of the paper, we present a simple theoretical framework in which the trend in
unemployment is explained by both the trend and the variance of productivity growth.
The key mechanism that explains these relationships rests on the assumption that real
wages, and more broadly real marginal costs, adjust upward less costly than they adjust
downward.
Asymmetric real wage rigidities generate two testable predictions in our framework.
First, for a given volatility of productivity growth, a slowdown in long-run productivity
growth generates a signi…cant rise in long-run unemployment. This is because, when
growth is lower, productivity reductions will run more frequently into the downward wage
rigidity constraint, thus making it more likely that real revenues will fall relative to costs,
which in turn would force …rms to reduce labor demand in order to protect pro…ts. Second,
for a given long-run productivity growth, a higher volatility raises the probability of a
signi…cant adverse shock that makes the downward wage constraint binding, thus leading

to higher long-run unemployment. Conversely, even when the trend in productivity growth
is low, a decline in its volatility reduces these risks and causes the unemployment trend
to fall.
The paper also presents empirical evidence on U.S. data consistent with the implications of the theoretical model. First, the low-frequency movements of productivity
growth and of the variance of productivity growth are signi…cant determinants of the
low-frequency movements of unemployment. This holds true even when we control for
changes in the demographic composition of the labor force. Second, speci…cations that
include a measure of productivity growth volatility are associated with a signi…cant improvement in the goodness of …t relative to a linear speci…cation in long-run productivity
growth only. This is consistent with the notion that macroeconomic volatility played an
important role during the fall in long-run unemployment over the 1980s and its rise during
the late 2000s, as visible in Figure 1. Indeed, these two episodes cannot be fully explained
by low frequency movements of productivity growth only. Our …nding therefore also contributes to the recent evidence on the macroeconomic e¤ects of measures of volatility and
uncertainty (see Bloom, 2009, Baker, Bloom and Davis, 2012, and Fernandez-Villaverde
et al. 2011).
A …rst motivation for our analysis comes from a number of empirical papers on aggregate data, including Bruno and Sachs (1985), Phelps (1994), Blanchard et al. (1995),
Blanchard and Wolfers (2000), Staiger, Stock, and Watson (2001) Pissarides and Vallanti
(2007), and Shimer (2010), which show time-series and cross-country evidence in favor of a
negative relationship between unemployment and productivity growth at low frequencies.
In a related theoretical study, Ball and Mankiw (2002) suggest a possible rationale for
the negative relationship between unemployment and productivity “resting on the idea
that ‘wage aspirations’adjust slowly to shifts in productivity growth”, as “workers come
to view the rate of real wage increase that they receive as normal and fair and to expect
it to continue”.3
A second motivation arises from a large body of literature supporting downward real
wage rigidities. A cursory observation at U.S. real wages and unemployment over the past
few decades in Figure 2 shows that real wages do not decline even when unemployment
rises signi…cantly; this feature is particularly striking during the recent recession. The
3

In traditional labor search models, the relationship between productivity and unemployment is generally uncertain, as it depends mostly on the extent to which jobs can be upgraded or need to be eliminated
when new technology arises (Mortensen and Pissarides, 1998). If …rms cannot embody the new technology
into existing jobs, higher productivity would lead to job destruction and higher unemployment (Aghion
and Howitt, 1994). If productivity increases for all existing jobs, demand for labor would increase and
unemployment would decline (Pissarides, 2000, Pissarides and Vallanti, 2007).

“existence of real wage rigidities has been pointed to by many authors as a feature needed
to account for a number of labor market facts”(Blanchard and Gali, 2007, p.36). Indeed,
a recent literature, popularized by Shimer (2005), Hall (2005), Gertler and Trigari (2009),
Barnichon (2010) and Blanchard and Gali (2010), emphasizes that real wage rigidities
contribute to explain labor-market dynamics at business cycle frequencies such as the
high volatility of employment and vacancies, as well as the low volatility of real wages and
jobless recoveries.4 Our paper contributes to this literature by showing that asymmetric
real rigidities can also account for unemployment dynamics at low frequencies, in a way
that depends on macroeconomic volatility.
The hypothesis of downward real wage rigidities appears to receive empirical support in
numerous studies using survey data, particularly in recent years when these surveys have
become more widely available. Several papers employ large panels of advanced economies,
including Babecky et al. (2010), Dickens et al. (2008), Du Caju et al. (2009), Fabiani et
al. (2010), Fagan and Messina (2009), Holden and Wulfsberg (2009), and Messina et al.
(2010). Regarding speci…c advanced economies, Christo…des and Nearchou (2010) and

in Canada, arguing (in the second paper) that “90% of expected in‡ation is built into a
contract ex ante and over 62% of unexpected in‡ation in the previous contract is built
into the current notional wage adjustment.” Bauer et al. (2007) …nd that in Germany
30% to 70% of wages settings are subject to downward real wage rigidities; Devicienti et
al. (2007) show that in Italy that proportion varies between 45% to 65%; Barwell and
Schweitzer (2007) suggest that in the UK downward real wage rigidities a¤ect on average
41% of the workers.
Our work also complements an important literature which highlighted the relevance of
demographic changes in labor force participation in explaining low-frequency movements
of unemployment (see Shimer, 1998, and Francis and Ramey, 2009, among others). We
show that the …nding of a signi…cant role for the trend and the variance of productivity
growth in explaining the trend in unemployment is robust to controlling for movements in
the share of young workers in the labor force as well as to using the measure of “genuine”
unemployment that Shimer (1998) argues to be una¤ected by demographics in‡uences.
Finally, Hairault et al. (2010) show that a matching model generates the reducedform prediction of a positive link between macroeconomic volatility and labour market
outcomes. Interestingly, the authors report a negative association between unemployment
and total factor productivity as well as a positive association between unemployment and
the squared values of total factor productivity in an annual panel of 20 OECD countries
over the period 1982-2003. While we share the emphasis on the role of productivity growth
variance, the theoretical mechanism in this paper is rather di¤erent and the inference is
drawn upon time series evidence for the United States.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model and shows the mechanism through which asymmetric real wage rigidities generate a long-run relationship
between unemployment, productivity growth and its volatility. Section 3 confronts the
predictions of the model with the time series properties of U.S. data and present evidence of a positive relationship between unemployment and productivity growth trends as
well as a negative association between long-run unemployment and productivity growth
variance. Section 4 assesses the robustness of our …ndings to splitting the sample around
the onset of the great moderation, to using total factor productivity (rather than labour productivity) and to controlling for demographic trends. Section 5 concludes. The
appendices provide details of the empirical models.

The theoretical framework

In this section, we show that introducing a simple form of asymmetric real wage rigidities
into an otherwise standard macroeconomic framework allows us to capture key macroeconomic implications for unemployment, while grounding them better on the empirical
evidence discussed in the previous section. A richer general equilibrium model with downward real wage rigidities is presented in our working-paper version, Benigno, Ricci, and
Surico (2010). Consider a neoclassical model with pro…t-maximizing …rms having a production function Yt = At Lt , where Yt is output produced, At is productivity and (with
0 < < 1) measures decreasing return to scale. Given this technology, the labor demand
schedule has the form
1
ln Ldt =
(w~ + ln At ln wt );
(1)
1
where Ldt is the demand of labor and w~ ln : High values of the real wage reduce the
demand of labor because they push up marginal costs of …rms.5 On the contrary an
increase in productivity raises the marginal productivity of labor and, for given wages,
simply allows …rms to hire more.
A standard labor-supply schedule can be derived from the …rst-order conditions of
optimizing households with respect to labor and consumption. With separable isoelastic
utility, the labor supply schedule can be written in a simple exact log-linear form
ln Lst = (ln wt + ln

t)

(2)

where measures the Frisch elasticity of labor supply and t is the marginal utility of
consumption. Workers are willing to supply more labor, Lst ; for higher real wages. Under
log-consumption utility (which is required to deliver a balance-growth path), the marginal
utility of consumption can be written as t = Yt 1 = At 1 (Ldt ) , taking into account that
consumption is equal to output in equilibrium. We are also implicitly assuming that
employment is always determined by demand and therefore we evaluate t given the
amount of labor e¤ectively employed.
Following Galì (2011), unemployment can be naturally de…ned as the excess of supply
of workers with respect to labor demand, at a given wage (in logs)
ut = ln Lst
5

ln Ldt :

(3)

In our model, the real wage and productivity are the only variables in‡uencing the real marginal
costs and therefore labor demand. In models of unemployment through search and matching frictions,
Krause and Lubik (2007), Blanchard and Galì (2010) and Hairault et al. (2010) have shown that search
frictions a¤ect directly the real marginal costs and can contribute to their variation.

6

Using this result, we can combine (1) and (2) into (3) to obtain
ut = (ln wt

ln At

w);

(4)

where w w(1+
~
)= and
(1+ )=(1
): The above equation shows that unemployment ‡uctuations are driven by the di¤erences between the real wage and productivity.
In a neoclassical model, wages perfectly adjust to clear labor market so that labor
demand is always equal to supply. Unemployment is equal to zero, employment is constant
and equal to its frictionless level and real wages always catch up with productivity, i.e.
wtf = At exp(w). In particular, let’s assume that the log of productivity is distributed as
a Brownian motion with drift g and variance 2 :
d ln At = gdt + dBt

(5)

in which Bt denotes a standard Brownian motion with zero drift and unit variance.
In this case, real wages inherit the same trend as productivity in equilibrium, while
long-run unemployment does not exhibit a trend.6 Clearly, so far, this framework ignores
the key empirical evidence on wage rigidities discussed in the previous section, as it
assumes that wages adjust immediately to any productivity movements leaving no room
for productivity to in‡uence unemployment, both in the short run and in the long run.
Even allowing for real distortions in the form of some monopoly power in the labor
market, as in Dunlop (1944), would not alter this result. Such monopoly power would add
a constant component to unemployment (u), thus entailing a modi…cation of the above
equation (4) as follows
ut = u + (ln wt ln At w);
(6)
where, as in Galì (2011), u represents the natural rate of unemployment. When wages
are fully ‡exible, unemployment will continue to depend only on u in both the short and
the long run, and not on productivity.
We now argue that real wage rigidities would alter this result and o¤er a role for
productivity in (6). But whether they are symmetric or asymmetric would make a crucial
di¤erence.
Let’s …rst consider the case of symmetric real wage rigidities. Among others, Ball
and Mankiw (2002) and Ball and Mo¢ t (2002) consider that wages are slow to catch-up
with productivity movements, so that productivity would be re‡ected into movements of
6

We could also allow g and to vary over time through stationary stochastic processes. However, this
would come at the cost of analytical tractability without overturning our results. Indeed our focus is on
the e¤ects that the long-run means of g and have on long-run unemployment.

unemployment. This is clearly visible in (6): if wages do not catch up completely with
productivity, productivity itself can a¤ect the unemployment rate, accounting for part of
the empirical evidence described in the previous section.
However, this explanation presents some shortcomings. First, for productivity to a¤ect
unemployment in the long-run, there should be some incomplete catch-up of real wages to
productivity growth even in the long run which is somewhat hard to justify. Moreover, this
explanation gives no role for the volatility of productivity growth to a¤ect unemployment.
This can be easily seen in (6) by considering the special case in which the trend in
productivity growth is close to zero and real wages are completely rigid (both upward and
downward): positive and negative shocks to productivity would imply symmetric e¤ects
on employment and unemployment in such a way that average unemployment will not be
a¤ected by higher or lower volatility.
Consider now the case of asymmetric real wage rigidities (wages adjust more easily
upward rather than downward) and in particular let us …rst focus on the limiting case in
which wages never fall. The top chart of Figure (3) plots a possible path for the level of
productivity with some trend and volatility. In the same graph, a path of real wages consistent with complete downward in‡exibility is shown.7 The bottom chart in the Figure
plots the equilibrium unemployment rate consistent with (6). Following positive productivity developments, real wages can rise to match productivity, and the labor market
clears with unemployment at the natural rate. However, as soon as productivity declines,
workers are not willing to lower real wages and …rms demand less labor, and the excess
of supply of labor at that wage translates into higher unemployment. The asymmetric
adjustment in real wages translates into an asymmetric response of unemployment to productivity shocks. Recessions are much worse than expansions for unemployment, simply
because a negative shock to productivity would translate into higher unemployment given
the resistance of real wages to fall. On the contrary, a positive shock to productivity would
be compensated by high real wages without delivering higher employment.
Figure (3) can also help describing the intuition for the long run relationship. We
can loosely think of long-run unemployment as the average of unemployment over all the
horizon shown in the …gure. First, imagine that productivity follows a path with a higher
trend. In this case declines in productivity, requiring a negative wage adjustment, are less
likely and therefore the average unemployment computed over the full horizon is smaller.
The model would be consistent with the negative relationship found in the data between
trends in productivity growth and long-run unemployment. Second, imagine, again in
7

The variable wt is appropriately scaled by exp(w) in the Figure to align it with the level of productivity. We thank one of the referees for suggesting this Figure.

Figure 3: The top chart illustrates a possible path of the level of productivity, At , and of
real wages, wt : The latter variable is scaled by the factor exp(w) and mimick productivity
when wt > wt 1 otherwise it remains constant at previous level because of the downwardrigidity constraint. In the bottom chart we plot the equilibrium level of unemployment
resulting from equation (6).

Figure (3), a path for productivity with a higher volatility without changing the trend.
In this case, negative cycles are ampli…ed and recessions are much deeper. On average
unemployment is higher over the full period, which explains the positive relationship
between unemployment and the volatility of productivity growth found in the data at
low frequencies.8 The model with asymmetric rigidities can at the same time address the
shortcomings of the model with symmetric rigidities as well as deliver new and interesting
results.
To develop this intuition formally, assume that real wages are constrained in their
adjustment by the following limit
d ln wt

dt:

i.e. real wages can move up freely, but they are constrained not to fall by more than
percent. In other words, real wages are not necessarily completely downward rigid:
there are downward real wage rigidities of varying degree in our model, so that nominalwage growth can also fall below price in‡ation. This implies that whenever there are bad
productivity shocks requiring real wages to fall by more than percent, real wages would
only adjust downward by percent and unemployment would arise. Instead when shocks
are positive, or moderately negative so as to require a movement in real wages that does
not run into the constraint, real wages are assumed to adjust perfectly to productivity
as in the frictionless model, wt = wtf = At exp(w), and therefore the labor market clears
completely.9 Since it is always the case that wages are bounded below by the ‡exiblewage level, i.e. wt
wtf , equation (6) implies that u
ut < 1. Moreover, since lnAt
follows a Brownian motion with drift g and standard deviation ; equation (6) implies
that unemployment, ut ; is going to follow a regulated Brownian motion.10 Indeed, it is a
8

Figure (3) suggests that in the short-run unemployment is negatively related with productivity during
downturns and uncorrelated during expansions. If volatility is lower, for the same trend, downturns are
less likely and then an econometrician would detect a lower correlation between unemployment and productivity over a sample. Figure (3) also suggests that there is not a clear negative or positive relationship,
in the short run, between the level of unemployment and productivity growth.
9
More generally, as discussed in the working-paper version Benigno, Ricci and Surico (2010), optimizing wage setters would choose an adjustment rule that tries to minimize the ine¢ ciencies of downward
real wage in‡exibility. As a consequence, they would refrain from excessive real wage increases when
favorable shocks require upward adjustment as explained by Elsby (2009). In particular, in the model of
Benigno, Ricci and Surico (2010), wage setters will choose a wage below, but proportional to, the ‡exible
wage, thus pushing current employment above the ‡exible-case level. In the current Figure (3) there will
be periods in which unemployment is below the natural rate. This mechanism would provide additional
interesting features to the model which, however, would not alter the sign of the long-run relationships
between unemployment, productivity growth and its volatility highlighted in the text. For more details,
we refer the reader to Benigno, Ricci and Surico (2010).
10
A regulated Brownian motion is a brownian motion with a re‡ecting barrier. Within the boundaries,

10

Brownian motion with mean
(g + ) and variance 2 2 when the constraint on wages
holds with equality, i.e. when d ln wt =
dt, while it has a re‡ecting barrier at u when
wages adjust upward, i.e. when d ln wt >
dt. The probability distribution function
for such process can be computed at each point in time.11 Standard results assure that
this probability distribution converges to an equilibrium distribution for t ! 1, when
the drift of the Brownian motion of ut is negative, i.e. g + > 0 so that
(g + ) < 0. In
this case, it can be shown that the long-run cumulative distribution of ut , denoted with
P ( ); is given by
P (u1

;

which shows that a determinant of the long-run average unemployment is the ratio
between the volatility of productivity growth and its mean. The latter is adjusted for
the degree of downward wage ‡exibility.
Results are consistent with the intuition underlined above and with the empirical
evidence presented in the introduction. First, the higher is the volatility of productivity
growth, the higher is the long term unemployment rate. Second, the lower is the trend in
productivity growth, the higher is the long term unemployment rate. Finally, the degree
of downward wage ‡exibility has clearly an important role for the results. When, real
wages are strictly downward rigid, = 0; what matters for long-run unemployment is
just the ratio between volatility and trend of productivity growth. With more ‡exibility
downward, i.e. a positive , unemployment costs will be lower, for the same trend and
volatility in productivity growth. In the limiting case of complete ‡exibility in real wages,
! 1, long-run unemployment collapses to the constant u driven purely by monopoly
distortions, as previously discussed.
Another important result of our model is that, in the long run, real wages are expected
to grow at the same rate as the productivity trend, g: This can be seen easily seen by
taking the time-0 expectation of (6)

Using the result in (7) that E0 [u1 ] converges to a …nite number, then it follows that
lim E0 [ln wt =t] = g; where the limit is taken for t ! 1. Intuitevely by looking at Figure
(3), one should expect that periods of constant wages will be eventually followed by
periods in which real wages catch up with productivity so that the expectation on where
the real wage should be in the long run is aligned with the trend in productivity growth.
This result contrasts with the models of Ball and Mankiw (2002) and Ball and Mo¢ t
(2002) where real wages do not catch with productivity growth in the long run.
It is worth noting that in our model, whereas the distribution of productivity growth
is symmetric, that of real-wage growth is going to be skewed. Indeed, it is mainly the
di¤erence between the shape of the two distributions which translates into unemployment
costs, through equation (6). This is important, as our model entails a long run e¤ect of
productivity on unemployment even when wages catch up with productivity in the long
run, while with such catch up there would be no e¤ect at all in models with symmetric
wage rigidities.

Evidence for the United States

A key prediction of the theoretical model is that the variance of productivity growth has
explanatory power, over the long run, for the mean of the unemployment rate over and
above the role played by the mean of productivity growth. The Great Moderation and
the recent Great Recession appear sensible candidates to evaluate the predictions of our
theory. After 1984, the U.S. economy was characterized by lower macroeconomic volatility,
which was associated with lower average unemployment despite ‡at productivity growth
(see Figure 1). The opposite occurred in late 2000s: high volatility and unemployment,
despite ‡at productivity. This section presents empirical evidence supporting this visual
observation.
In order to retrieve estimates of the long-run mean of unemployment and productivity
growth as well as the variance of productivity growth, we follow two strategies consistent
with what presented in Figure 1. Under the …rst strategy, these long-run statistics are
computed using averages and variances over 5-year rolling-windows. Under the second
strategy, we estimate an empirical model with time-varying parameters and then focus
12

on the long-run statistics implied by the time-varying estimates. In particular, following
the literature popularized by Cogley and Sargent (2005), Primiceri (2005), Canova and
Gambetti (2009), and Galì and Gambetti (2009), we model the evolution of productivity
growth, gt , real wage growth, wt , and the rate of unemployment, ut , using a VAR
with drifting coe¢ cients and stochastic volatilities, which evolve as (driftless) random
walks and geometric random walks respectively. The drifting coe¢ cients enable us to
construct a time-varying measure for the mean of the variables of interest. Both the
drifting coe¢ cients and the stochastic volatilities allow us to construct a time-varying
measure of volatility. Details of the model speci…cation, estimation method and the
construction of time-varying means and variances from the estimates of the VAR are
summarized in the Appendix.
The data were collected from the Fred database available at the Federal Reserve bank
of St. Louis. Productivity is the non-farm business sector output per hour of all persons
(acronym ‘OPHNFB’), wage is the non-farm business sector real compensation per hour
(acronym ‘COMPRNFB’), and unemployment is the rate of civilian unemployment for
persons with 16 years of age or older (acronym ‘UNRATE’).13 We use seasonally adjusted
quarterly data from 1949Q1 to 2010Q2 (where the …rst part of the sample is used as
training sample in the VAR, as described below). We compute annual growth rates for
productivity and real wage to smooth out the high frequency components of the data.
Growth rates are approximated by log di¤erences. Results are robust to using quarterly
changes.
Under the VAR strategy, the coe¢ cients priors are calibrated using a training sample of
thirteen years, from 1949Q1-1961Q4. The results hereafter, are based on the estimation
sample 1962Q1 to 2010Q2. The estimates of long run unemployment (~
ut ), long run
2
productivity (~
gt ), and the variance of productivity (~t ) are obtained from the estimates
of the time-varying VAR using Appendix equation (B.1) together with the formulas (B.9)
and (B.10). These series are shown in Figure 1. Under the rolling-windows approach, the
sample ends in 2008Q1 and the observation at a generic quarter refers to the 5 year (19
quarters) moving average centered at that quarter.
13

To make our empirical results comparable with earlier contributions (see for instance Staiger, Stock
and Watson, 2001), we measure productivity as the ratio of output to total hours in the non-farm business
sector, Y =L. This measure is computed and released by the Bureau of Labour Statistics. In our model,
productivity is de…ned as Y =L and the …rst di¤erence of its logarithm is denoted by g. Note that
assuming a standard labour to capital ratio of 2=3 the correlation between g and the …rst di¤erence of
the logarithm of Y =L is 0:91 over our sample period. In Section 4, we present some robustness analysis
using total factor productivity.

3.1

Fit of linear models

This section presents some empirical evidence consistent with the main predictions of the
model: the mean of unemployment depends negatively from the mean of productivity
growth and positively from the variance of productivity growth. To verify these hypotheses, one needs to rely on regressions involving low-frequency trends. As such, the
analysis below bears some similarities with the band spectral regression analysis pioneered by Engle (1974) and studied by a large body of subsequent research. An important
take away from that literature is that low frequency band estimation does not pose a
challenge for consistency but the estimates of the coe¢ cient variance are biased because
of serial correlation in the disturbances. As discussed by Engle (1974), if the …lter has a
rectangular window (as for instance when using a moving average) the bias in the standard error will be due only to a loss of degrees of freedom, coming from the fact that the
inference is now based on T =h (rather than T ) observations where h represents the size
of the smoothing window in unit of times.
Unfortunately, it has proved hard in the literature to develop appropriate tools for
reliable inference in this context. Engle (1974), for instance, suggests adjusting the standard errors by the reduced number of degrees of freedom. Alternatively, one may wish
to employ very long lags in the formula provided by Newey and West (1987) to account
for heteroskedasticity and auto-correlation in the error term. While these adjustments go
some way towards addressing the disturbances serial correlation, they generally allow to
generate suggesting rather than conclusive evidence. To enhance reliability of results, we
adjust the standard error estimates using a window of 20 quarters. The reason for this
choice is twofold. First, the rolling windows evidence is based on …ltering out frequency
above …ve years. Second, in the Appendix we show that, using the low frequency components extracted by the rolling windows or implied by the VAR, the estimates of the
standard errors tend to ‡atten out (or even decrease) after a lag truncation of about 20
quarters in the Newey-West formula.
As for the empirical speci…cation, a natural benchmark of comparison for assessing the
role of productivity volatility in explaining low-frequency movements in unemployment
is the linear regression employed in earlier contributions (see for instance Pissarides and
Vallanti, 2007), which relates long-run unemployment to long-run productivity growth:
u~t = a

b g~t + "t

(8)

where a and b are parameters and "t is a well-behaved stochastic disturbance. Using the
rolling-window …lter, we project long-run unemployment on long-run productivity growth
14

as in equation (8):
u~t = 0:08

(0:004)

0:86 g~t + "^t

(0:142)

(9)

which results in a R2 of 0:33. The adjusted standard errors reported in parenthesis are
based on the Newey-West formula with a lag truncation of 20 quarters.14 Repeating the
estimation of equation (8) using the time-varying means implied by the estimates of the
VAR, we obtain
u~t = 0:10
2:25 g~t + "^t
(10)
(0:004)

(0:196)

with an R2 of the regression equal to 0:73.
The estimates of these simple models show that there is a tight negative relationship
between productivity growth and unemployment in the long-run. Under both regressions,
the coe¢ cient are signi…cant. In particular, a 1% fall in long-run productivity growth
corresponds to an increase in long-run unemployment of 0:86 percentage point using the
rolling windows and 2:25 percentage points with the VAR estimates.
Figure 4 confronts long-run unemployment, depicted as a red line, with the …tted
values from equation (9) and (10) respectively, depicted as blue dotted and dash lines,
respectively. The linear model appears to do a good job in tracking qualitatively the movements in the unemployment rate. However, a closer inspection of the …gure reveals that
the linear model cannot adequately explain the decline in trend unemployment between
1984 and 1992, the rise since the late 1990s, and the developments since 2007.
The theoretical model of Section 2 suggests two departures from the linear speci…cation
(8). First, it highlights the relevance of the variance of productivity growth. Consistent
with Figure 1, movements in the variance of productivity growth coincide with movements
in long-run unemployment, especially during the periods where the mean of productivity growth does not have much explanatory power. Second, under the limiting case of
downward real wage in‡exibility, the model allows us to derive a nonlinear relationship
between unemployment and productivity growth in closed form.
To appreciate the relative importance of these modi…cations, we proceed in two steps.
First, within this section, we augment the linear speci…cation in (8) with a variance
term. Then, in next section, we estimate the relationship between unemployment and
productivity growth nonlinearly.
Remaining within a linear framework, we estimate the following speci…cation which
14

Using a T =20 adjustment for computing the degrees of freedom of an otherwise conventional standard
error produces estimates which are on average 50% to 80% larger than the standard errors based on the
Newey-West correction.

of the estimation:

(12)
(0:003)

(0:134)

(12:52)

where the variance term is signi…cant and the R2 of the regression now rises to 0:44.
Repeating the same estimation using the long-run statistics obtained from the VAR estimates, we get
u~t = 0:08
1:68 g~t + 50:83 ~t2 + "^t
(13)
(0:003)

(0:100)

(4:853)

where the R2 is again higher at 0:95.
Both regressions display an increase in the R2 relative to the estimates based on a
linear speci…cation in long-run productivity growth only. Not surprisingly, as also visible
in Figure 4, the …tted values from equations (12) and (13) track unemployment trend
better than the respective linear models (9) and (10). The improvement is particularly
evident for the VAR, where the introduction of the variance terms allows the model to
better account for the decline in long-run unemployment of the 1980 and the rise of the
late 2000s, compared to the speci…cation with just productivity. Overall, the coe¢ cient
on the productivity mean is somewhat lower than in the linear speci…cation.
The e¤ect of the variance is also economically signi…cant: under the …rst speci…cation
an increase of one standard deviation (0.00014) would imply a rise in long-run unemployment of about 0:35 percent, while under the second speci…cation an increase of one
standard deviation (0.00005) would imply an increase in long-run unemployment of about
0:25 percent. In particular, the VAR-based estimates in Figure 1 reveal that the variance
of productivity growth declined from 0:0003 to about 0:00025 during the second half of
the 1980s when long-run unemployment fell from about 6% to 5:5%. In light of the estimated coe¢ cients in (13), this implies that the decline in the variance of productivity
growth can account for about 50% of the fall in long-run unemployment during this episode. Between 2000 and 2009, the variance of productivity growth has increased from
0:00024 to 0:0004 against the backdrop of a rise in long-run unemployment from 5% to
6%. These numbers imply a 80% contribution of the variance of productivity growth to
long-run unemployment during the 2000s.

The …tted values associated with the non-linear models are presented in Figure 5.
This speci…cation tends to track long-run unemployment well and seems to outperform
the linear speci…cation of Figure 4 which is based on long-run productivity growth only. In
particular, the nonlinear model appears to capture well the fall in long-run unemployment
during the 1984-1992 period and its increase during the late 2000s.
The above results bear interesting implications in terms of the primitive parameters
of the model. The ‡exible-wage unemployment rate, u, is precisely estimated, under both
speci…cations, in the range of 4% to 5%. Downward real wage rigidities play a signi…cant
role. The threshold for such rigidities is estimated at values around 0, i.e. close to
plain downward wage rigidities. Using the 5-year rolling-windows, a positive (although
statistically indistinguishable from zero) is estimated at around 0:4% on an annul basis,
meaning that real wages can fall at most 0:4% when evaluated over a year horizon, which
is a number consistent with the degree of downward wage rigidity shown at the aggregate
level for the U:S: in Figure 2. Under the time series built using the VAR estimates, is
negative and around 0:7% on annul basis meaning that the best …t of the model requires
wage growth to exceed at least 0:7% from year to year. Notice that if we constrained
to be non-negative, then would turn out to be zero, would be estimated at 2:94, with
a standard error of 0:3188, and u would be estimated at 0:034, with a standard error of
0:008.
The estimate of can be used to make some inference on other primitive parameters of

the model: the exponent of labor in the production function, , and the Frisch elasticity
of labor supply, : A value for equal to 1:71 as in (15) is consistent with low values for
the Frisch elasticity and for (not larger than 0:4); the estimate in (16) implies a slightly
smaller upper bound on . However, when we restrict to be non-negative, then a value
of equal to 2.94 can be consistent with values of up to 0:66 while the estimated Frisch
elasticity of labor supply would still be small.
In summary, versions of the theoretical model that feature asymmetries in real rigidities appear to account for the low-frequency movements in the U.S. unemployment rate
better than a model with symmetric real rigidity.

Sensitivity analysis

In this part of the paper, we assess the robustness of the empirical regularities documented above along three dimensions: sub-sample stability, using a measure of total
factor productivity (in place of labour productivity) and controlling for demographics.
For simplicity and comparability with existing literature, the linear speci…cation is chosen
as a reference. To preview the results, none of these modi…cations appears to overturn our
earlier …ndings of a negative correlation between unemployment and productivity growth
trends and a positive correlation between the unemployment trend and the volatility of
productivity growth.

4.1

Sub-samples

As discussed in the previous section, the focus on low-frequency components implies that
our inference is in fact based on fewer observations than the actual full-sample. To
assess the extent to which our results may be driven by speci…c historical episodes, we
perform here a sub-sample analysis splitting the sample around 1983Q4, a cut-o¤ for
the beginning of the great moderation consistent with the dating estimated by Kim and
Nelson (1999) and Stock and Watson (2002). For this exercise, we report results based
on the speci…cation (11) but the estimates are robust to using either (8) or (14).
The …ndings for the sub-sample 1962Q1-1983Q4 based on the …ve years rolling and

20

the VAR estimates are respectively:15
u~t = 0:07

(0:006)

u~t = 0:08

(0:003)

1:02 g~t + 32:22 ~t2 + "^t ,

R2 =0:53

1:87 g~t + 41:89 ~t2 + "^t ,

R2 =0:98

(0:245)

(13:62)

(0:069)

(5:586)

whereas the estimates associated with the post-1983 period are respectively:
u~t = 0:06

(0:003)

u~t = 0:07

(0:006)

0:53 g~t + 78:72 ~t2 + "^t ,

R2 =0:65

1:24 g~t + 54:78 ~t2 + "^t ,

R2 =0:83

(0:089)

(16:02)

(0:221)

(7:180)

In summary, we conclude that the negative correlation between unemployment and
productivity growth trends as well as the positive relationship between long-run unemployment and the volatility of productivity growth appear stable across a sample split
around the onset of the great moderation.

4.2

Total factor productivity

While labour productivity is likely to be lesser prone to measurement errors, Total Factor
Productivity (TFP) is probably closer to the theoretical concept in the model of Section
2. Accordingly, in this section we explore the extent to which our results are robust
to replacing labour productivity growth with TFP growth in the estimates of equation
(11). More speci…cally, we employ the quarterly measure of TFP constructed by Fernald
(2012) for the United States to compute the low-frequency component and the volatility
of productivity growth using either 5 year rolling windows or a time-varying VAR that
otherwise would be identical to the one used for labour productivity growth.
The estimates based on the rolling window …lter are as follows:
u~t = 0:06

(0:003)

0:59 g~t + 17:17 ~t2 + "^t

(0:149)

(7:74)

with R2 =0:37, whereas the regression based on the estimates from the time-varying VAR
reads:
u~t = 0:06

(0:004)

1:22 g~t + 40:13 ~t2 + "^t

(0:162)

15

(6:61)

In keeping with the previous analysis, standard errors correct for heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation using the Newey-West formula and 20 quarters truncation. The results below are robust to using
the T =20 degree of freedom adjustment in the computation of otherwise conventional standard errors.

21

with R2 =0:82. Under both speci…cations, the mean and variance of productivity growth
still appear as signi…cant determinants of long-run unemployment, with estimates that
are not statistically di¤erent from those obtained using labour productivity growth.

4.3

Controlling for demographics

An important strand of the literature has convincingly argued that changes in the demographic composition of the labour force a¤ects the low-frequency movements in unemployment (Shimer, 1998), the low-frequency movements in productivity (Francis and Ramey,
2009) and the variance of real output growth (Jaimovich and Siu, 2009).
In this section, we assess the robustness of the estimates from the linear speci…cation
to controlling for demographics. To this end, we construct time series for the share of
workers in the labor force with age (i) between 16 and 21 (as in Francis and Ramey,
2009), (ii) between 16 and 34 (as in Shimer, 1998), and (i) the sum of the shares of
workers in the 16-29 and the 60-64 windows of age (as in Jaimovich and Siu, 2009). We
then use each of these three demographic indicators as additional controls in equations
(8) and (11), one at the time. In addition, in a fourth regression, we construct a di¤erent
left-hand-side variable to proxy for what Shimer (1998) refers to as a measure of genuine
unemployment which is not a¤ected by demographics; this is done by running a regression
of the unemployment rate on a constant and the unemployment rate of workers in prime
age (de…ned as those between 35 and 64 years).16 Then, we use the 5-year rolling-window
averages of the …tted values from this regression in place of the 5-year rolling-window
unemployment rate. As for the VAR, we replace the unemployment rate with genuine
unemployment and use it together with productivity growth and real wages to extract the
low-frequency components and variances of the variables of interest in a newly estimated
time-varying VAR which is otherwise all alike the one used in the Section 3.17
The results of these sensitivity analyses are reported in Tables 1 and 2 for the 5-year
rolling-windows and for the time-varying VAR estimates, respectively. The tables present
estimates for the linear model using the trend of productivity growth and the measures
of labor force share in columns 1 to 3, as in equation (8), and then adding the variance
of productivity growth in columns 5 to 7, as in equation (11) The estimates for the
speci…cations using Shimer’s measure of genuine unemployment are displayed in columns
4 and 8, without and with the variance of productivity growth respectively.
16

The estimated coe¢ cients (standard errors) of this regression are: 0:0075 (0.0014) for the intercept
and 1:2716 (0.0340) for the slope. R2 = 0:851. Sample: 1948Q1:2010Q2.
17
The labor force series were collected from the Bureau of Labor Statistics using data gathered in the
Current Population Survey. These data can also be used to compute the unemployment rate for prime-age
workers. The series used in this section are reported in the Appendix.

22

Two main results emerge from Tables 1 and 2. First, controlling for demographics
does not seem to overturn our …nding of a role played by both the long-run mean and the
variance of productivity growth to explain low-frequency movements in unemployment.
In particular, the estimated coe¢ cient on ~t2 in columns 5 to 8 is positive and large, at
values that are not inconsistent with the estimates in (9) and (10). Similar results are
obtained for the estimated coe¢ cient on g~t , although its e¤ect is sometimes smaller than
the estimated counterpart based on speci…cations without demographics.

Second, in line with Shimer (1998), Francis and Ramey (2009) and Jaimovich and
Siu (2009), the composition of the labor force tends to have a non-negligible in‡uence on
the low-frequency movements in unemployment, although its robustness and signi…cance
appear muted once the variance of productivity growth is added as additional regressor
in the columns 5 to 7 of both tables.
In summary, the long-run mean and the variance of productivity growth appear to
play some role as drivers of U.S. long-run unemployment, over and above the role played
by changes in the demographic composition of the labor force.

Conclusions

Productivity growth and unemployment appear to be negatively related in the long-run, in
a way that depends positively on the variance of productivity growth. A simple model of
the labor market based on downward real wage rigidities is shown to generate predictions
that are consistent with this empirical …nding.
Our evidence on U.S. data reveals that higher volatility of productivity growth and
lower levels of long-run productivity growth tend to be associated with higher levels of
long-run unemployment. In particular, the results suggest that movements in the variance
of productivity growth may account for about 50% of the fall in long-run unemployment
during the second half of the 1980s and for about 80% of the increase in long run unemployment during the 2000s.

A time-varying VAR with stochastic volatility

Xt

where Xt collects the …rst p lags of Yt , t is a matrix of time-varying parameters, t are
reduced-form errors, Yt is de…ned as Yt [gt , wt ; ut ]0 , and p is set equal to 2. We stack
the time-varying VAR parameters in the vector t , which is assumed to evolve as:
p(

Q) = I( t ) f (

(B.2)

where I( t ) is an indicator function that takes a value of 0 when the roots of the associated
VAR polynomial are inside the unit circle and is equal to 1 otherwise. f ( t j t 1 , Q) is
given by
(B.3)
t = t 1+ t
with t N (0; Q). The VAR reduced-form innovations in (B.1) are postulated to be zeromean normally distributed, with time-varying covariance matrix t which is factored as

The time-series for long-run unemployment and long-run productivity growth are computed as local-to-date t approximations to the mean of the endogenous variables of the
VAR, evaluated at the posterior mean E( tjT ). Let us rewrite equation (B.1) in companion
form:
zt = CtjT + DtjT zt 1 + &t
where zt contains current and lagged values of Yt , CtjT is the vector of intercepts, DtjT is
the vector of stacked time-varying parameters and &t is a conformable vector containing
t and zeros. Following Cogley and Sargent (2005), the long-run mean for the vector zt
can then be computed as:
1
z~t = I DtjT
CtjT
(B.9)
where, given the order of the variables in the VAR, the …rst and third elements of z~t
correspond to the mean of productivity growth, g~t , and the mean of unemployment, u~t ,
at time t.
The time-series for the unconditional variance of the variables in the VAR can be
R
estimated using the integral of the spectral density over all frequencies, $ ftjT (!), where
ftjT is de…ned as:
ftjT (!) = (I

DtjT e

i!

)

1

tjT

2

(I

DtjT e

i!

)

1 0

(B.10)

The element (1; 1) of the matrix ftjT (!) represents the unconditional variance of productivity growth, ~t2 , at time t.
The model (B.1)-(B.8) is estimated using Bayesian methods (see Kim and Nelson
(2000)). Full descriptions of the algorithm, including the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) used to simulate the posterior distribution of the hyperparameters and the
states conditional on the data, are provided in a number of papers (see, for instance,
Cogley and Sargent, 2005, Primiceri, 2005, and Canova and Gambetti, 2009) and will not
be repeated here.
Even though one cannot characterize analytically the joint posterior distribution of the
model parameters, it is possible to construct a Markov chain whose invariant distribution
35

is the posterior. The MCMC procedure draws from the marginal density of a set of
random variables j, conditional on some realizations for another set of random variables
i, and then drawing from the marginal distribution of i conditional on the realizations of j
in the previous step. Under some assumption, the chain converge to an invariant density
that equals the desired posterior density.
The elements of S are assumed to follow an inverse-Wishart distribution centered at
2 10 3 times the prior mean(s) of the relevant element(s) of the vector t with the prior
degrees of freedom equal to the minimum allowed. The prior covariance matrix for the
state innovations, Q, is set to 5 10 4 times the OLS estimate over the training sample
and thus is less infomrative than in Cogley and Sargent (2005) and Primiceri (2005). The
priors for all the other hyperparameters are borrowed from Cogley and Sargent (2005).
We use 100000 Gibbs sampling replications, discard the …rst 80000 as burn-in.
