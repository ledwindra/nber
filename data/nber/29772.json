    "abstract": "\n\nWe use a dataset of the entire population of English Parliamentary enclosure acts between 1750  and 1830 to provide the first evidence of their impact. Parliamentary enclosure led to the systematic  rationalization of traditional property rights. Exploiting a feature of the Parliamentary process that  produced such legislation as a source of exogenous variation, we show that such enclosures were associated  with significantly higher crop yields, but also higher land inequality. Our results are in line with  a literature going back to Arthur Young and Karl Marx on the effects of Parliamentary enclosure on  productivity and inequality. They do not support the argument that informal systems of governance,  even in small, cohesive, and stable communities, were able to efficiently allocate commonly used and  governed resources.\n\n",
