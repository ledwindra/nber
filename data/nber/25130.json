    "abstract": "\n\nPrior to the famous One Child Policy, China\u2019s total fertility rate declined by more than 50% during the 1970s - one of the most rapid sustained fertility declines documented in modern history. Coinciding with this transition was China\u2019s \ufb01rst national population policy, Wan Xi Shao, also known as the Longer, Later Fewer (LLF) campaign. Studying LLF\u2019s contribution to fertility and fertility strategies favoring sons, we \ufb01nd that the campaign i) reduced China\u2019s total fertility rate by 0.88 births per woman (explaining 27% of China\u2019s modern fertility decline), ii) doubled the use of male-biased fertility stopping rules, and iii) promoted postnatal selection (implying 200,000 previously unrecognized missing girls). Considering Chinese population policy to be extreme in global experience, our paper demonstrates the limits of population policy in explaining demographic transitions\u2014 and its potential human costs.\n\n",
