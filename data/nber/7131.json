    "abstract": "\n\nThe regression discontinuity (RD) data design is a quasi-experimental design with the defining characteristic that the probability of receiving treatment changes discontinuously as a function of one or more individual characteristics.  This data design occasionally arises in economic and other applications but is only infrequently exploited in evaluating the effects of a treatment.  We consider the problem of identification and estimation of treatment effects under a RD data design.  We offer an interpretation of the IV or so-called Wald estimator as a regression discontinuity estimator.  We propose nonparametric estimators of treatment effects and present their asymptotic distribution theory.  Then we apply the estimation method to evaluate the effect of EEOC-coverage on minority employment in small U.S. firms.\n\n",
