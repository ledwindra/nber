Investment, Accounting, and the Salience of the Corporate Income Tax

ABSTRACT
This paper develops and tests the hypothesis that accounting rules mitigate the effect of tax policy
on firm investment decisions by obscuring the timing of tax payments. I model a firm that maximizes
a discounted weighted average of after-tax cash flows and accounting profits. I estimate the weight
placed on accounting profits by comparing the effectiveness of tax incentives that do and do not affect
them. Investment tax credits, which do affect accounting profits, have larger effects on investment
than accelerated depreciation, which does not. This difference in estimated effects is not obviously
driven by discounting, cash flow effects, or measurement error. Results thus suggest that accelerated
depreciation provisions are less effective than they otherwise would be and that the corporate income
tax could create smaller distortions to investment decisions than we would otherwise estimate.

Introduction

The effects of taxation on capital formation have inspired a great deal of economic research
and frequent tax policy changes. Striking results from Chamley [1986] and Judd [1985]
indicate that the socially optimal tax system involves no distortion to capital investment
decisions, which is often interpreted as a zero tax rate on capital income. However, Hall and
Jorgenson [1967] and Abel [2007] have stressed that the size of any effect of tax policy on
investment decisions does not depend solely on the statutory tax rate, but also on the timing
of deductions from taxable income that firms take to account for depreciation. In fact, if
investment spending is fully deductible from taxable income in the year an investment is
made (a treatment known as “expensing”), then investment decisions may not be distorted
at all, just as Chamley [1986] and Judd [1985] would recommend.1
Indeed, the U.S. government has used accelerated depreciation provisions to encourage
capital expenditures for more than 50 years.2 Recently, so-called “bonus depreciation”—
a large, temporary acceleration of depreciation deductions—was among the major policy
responses to the recessions of 2001 and 2008. Full expensing of all equipment investment
was in place during 2011, and a permanent switch to expensing is often discussed as a
component of possible corporate tax reforms.3
This paper studies how accounting rules may affect the perception of the timing of these
depreciation deductions and may thus affect the impact of tax policy on firm investment
decisions. Both anecdotes and evidence suggest that shareholders, managers, and observers
of publicly-traded firms focus a great deal of attention on one particular measure of firm
performance among the vast amount of data available on public firms. This measure is

Note further that if interest payments are deductible from taxable income, then investment may effectively be subsidized under accelerated depreciation or expensing. When deductions are permitted at a faster
rate than economic depreciation, depreciation is said to be “accelerated.”
2
In 1954, depreciation rules were liberalized explicitly “to maintain the present high level of investment in
plant and equipment” (Senate Finance Committee, quoted in Brazell, Dworin, and Walsh [1989]). Legislation
changed the depreciation rules several times since then, but the intention to encourage investment through
accelerated depreciation has persisted.

the bottom line of a firm’s income statement when prepared under Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (GAAP), the set of rules that govern financial reporting in the United
States.4 This measure is commonly referred to as “net income,” or “earnings,” and I will
hereafter refer to it as “book earnings.”
Equity analysts and the business press devote a great deal of attention to book earnings.
Commonly reported and forecasted metrics like earnings growth, earnings per share, and
the price-to-earnings ratio are all based on this measure. The literature on the “accrual
anomaly” further supports the notion that investors focus attention on earnings. Sloan
[1996] writes that “stock prices are found to act as if investors ‘fixate’ on earnings, failing
to reflect fully information contained in the accrual and cash-flow components of current
earnings.” This “fixation” is consistent with boundedly-rational investors attempting to
make decisions based on only a subset of the information potentially available to them.
If investors fixate on book earnings, managers may rationally devote their energy to improving them. Indeed, incentive payments are often explicitly tied to earnings and other
accounting metrics.5 In their survey of corporate Chief Financial Officers, Graham, Harvey, and Rajgopal [2005] find that, “CFOs believe that earnings, not cash flows, are the
key metric considered by outsiders.” Beyond this survey evidence, accounting researchers
have documented myriad empirical examples where managers sacrifice actual cash flows or
alter real decisions in order to improve book earnings. For example, Erickson, Hanlon, and
Maydew [2004] report that their sample of 27 firms paid a total of $320 million dollars of
real cash taxes on earnings that were later alleged to be fraudulent. Baber, Fairfield, and
Haggard [1991] and others suggest that firms may reduce their real spending on activities
like research and development in order to avoid reporting a loss for accounting purposes, in
4

In fact, some may focus on Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) or Earnings Before Interest
Taxes and Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA). As these measures completely ignore tax payments,
any focus on them would strengthen the points made in this paper. Obviously, it is also possible to construct
performance measures that do correctly reflect the timing of cash tax payments, and some investors, firms,
and managers undoubtedly pay attention to these as well. The purpose of the empirical work in this paper
is to test whether any evidence for a fixation on earnings can be found in investment data.

an example of what is known as “real earnings management.” Shackelford, Slemrod, and
Sallee [2007] survey related literature and call for more research into its implications for tax
policy.
This paper develops, formalizes, and tests the hypothesis that GAAP accounting rules
obscure the timing of tax payments in a way that can mitigate the effect of tax policy on
investment decisions. While economists normally assume that firms make investment choices
to maximize the present discounted value of their future cash flows, I embed the potential
for an earnings fixation in an investment model by allowing the firm to place some weight
on book earnings (in addition to cash flows) when choosing its investment. I then show how
the the effect of tax variables on investment decisions depends on this weight placed on book
earnings.
As I will explain in detail below, GAAP accounting rules essentially prevent the schedule
of depreciation deductions contained in the tax code from affecting the timing of book
earnings. Perhaps unsurprisingly, a focus on book earnings thus mitigates the effect of
depreciation policy on investment decisions in the model. More notably, however, I show
that such a focus also mitigates the effect of the tax rate itself, a result that can be understood
through a comparison of the accounting treatment of depreciation deductions to expensing,
which we already know to be nondistortionary.
I then show how the weight placed on book earnings in the model can be estimated by
comparing the effect of accelerated depreciation (which does not affect book earnings) and
the investment tax credit (which does) on firm investment decisions. I take the model to
data from the Compustat panel of firms and estimate this weight by exploiting the many
changes in the depreciation and ITC rules rules seen over the last few decades. There is
considerable variation across specifications, but baseline estimates suggest that accelerated
depreciation has been about half as effective as the ITC in influencing investment, suggesting
that firms place considerable weight on book earnings when making investment decisions.
There are reasons to be concerned, however, that accelerated depreciation may be less

4

effective than the ITC for reasons other than its accounting treatment. First, measuring
the present value of future depreciation deductions requires assumptions about appropriate
discount rates. If these discount rates are improperly measured, estimates of the effect of
accelerated depreciation could be improperly attenuated or otherwise biased. Second, if
changes in accelerated depreciation rules take the form of shifting tax deductions from a
distant future year to a less distant future year, then these changes have no effect on firm
cash flows in the year of investment. The ITC, of course, does affect firm cash flows in the
year of invesment. If cash flows affect investment decisions, we might expect the ITC to
have more effect on investment through this cash flow channel alone.
Fortunately, it is possible to isolate the depreciation deductions that are available to the
firm in the year it makes an investment. These deductions need not be discounted and have
the same cash flow implications as the ITC. I find little evidence that these first-year depreciation deductions have any more effect than discounted future depreciation deductions,
so results do not appear to be driven by these obvious discounting or cash flow channels.
I discuss a number of other factors that one might suggest as reasons that accelerated depreciation could be less effective than the ITC, but none seem clearly compelling. I thus
conclude that results are at least consistent with a role for the accounting system in determining investment responses to tax policy, although I suspect that many readers will wish
to see more evidence before drawing definitive conclusions.
In the next section of the paper, I discuss related literature, revisit the reason why
a tax system with expensing does not distort investment decisions, detail the accounting
rules related to depreciation deductions, and provide intuition on the parallel between the
accounting rules and expensing. Section 3 models a firm that chooses its investment policy
to maximize a weighted average of cash flows and book earnings. In section 4, I discuss the
data used to estimate this weight. Section 5 presents results, and Section 6 concludes.

Background

2.1

Related literature

Baker, Ruback, and Wurgler [2007] distinguish two types of “behavioral” corporate finance—
one where managers themselves may be irrational (or boundedly-rational), and a second
where managers respond rationally to the irrationality of others. In my view, this paper falls
in the second category—I test the hypothesis that boundedly-rational investors focus their
attention on earnings, leading rational managers to focus on them as well.6 Note that even
if one was not interested in the effects of tax policy for their own sake, one could motivate
this paper with the question “Does the accounting system affect real investment decisions?”
This paper provides a tax-based test of this hypothesis.
I also consider this paper part of a recent strand of public finance literature that has emphasized the importance of the salience of taxation in understanding its effects on behavior.
This literature develops the insight—perhaps obvious to non-economists—that less noticeable taxes may have smaller effects on the behavior of boundedly-rational agents. Chetty,
Looney, and Kroft [2009] find that sales taxes have larger effects on consumer purchases
when these taxes are more salient, and Chetty and Saez [2009] find that providing detailed
information on the structure of the earned income tax credit increases its effects on labor
supply. This paper argues that salience may also be important for understanding the effect
of taxation on business investment decisions, although through a more nuanced channel. In
this case, it is investors and other firm outsiders for whom book earnings are claimed to be
particularly salient. Given this fixation on earnings, perfectly rational managers would have
the incentive to act as if they did not find taxes salient, even if they actually understand
the tax code very well.
Note that in a well-known paper by Stein [1989], a rational market still induces managers
to forsake positive NPV investments in order to boost current earnings. However, Stein’s
6

One could feasibly argue that real informational frictions make it optimal for even fully rational investors
to focus on earnings, but the view of investors as boundedly-rational strikes me as more compelling.

6

use of the term “earnings” does not comport with the accounting definition used in this
paper. In fact, in the model presented in this paper, a focus on current accounting earnings
would tend to encourage over investment, because the upfront cash cost of investment does
not appear on the earnings statement immediately—rather it appears only in depreciation
charges in future quarters. Rogerson [1997] formalizes the well-known notion that focusing
attention (and compensation) on appropriately-calculated alternative performance measures
like economic value added can restore appropriate investment incentives.
Finally, this paper joins recent literature that brings insights from the study of the
separation of ownership and control in corporate finance to bear on our understanding of
the effects of taxation. Examples include Desai, Dyck, and Zingales [2007], Chetty and
Saez [2010], Edgerton [2010], and Keuschnigg and Ribi [2010]. Beyond the previously-cited
Shackelford, Slemrod, and Sallee [2007], however, few papers have yet studied the potential
implications for tax policy of the much-discussed fixation on earnings. Neubig [2006] and
Poterba, Rao, and Seidman [2011] discuss implications for the political economy of corporate
tax reform. Graham, Hanlon, and Shevlin [2011] report survey evidence suggesting that the
accounting treatment of taxation is quite important for multinational firms deciding where
to locate their operations and when to repatriate earnings. Perhaps the paper most similar
to this one is Robinson and Sansing [2008], who study a model where both cash flows and
accounting profits enter the objective function of a manager choosing a mix of tangible
and intangible investments. Their key insight is that an accounting system that fails to
distinguish between operating expenses and intangibles investment could tend to discourage
intangibles investment. This issue is distinct from the ones studied in this paper.

2.2

Why expensing does not distort investment decisions

The result that a tax system with expensing need not distort investment decisions dates at
least to Hall and Jorgenson [1967]. To make clear the parallel between expensing and the
accounting treatment of depreciation, I revisit this result in a simple model of an equity7

financed firm evaluating an investment project using the net present value criterion.7 The
firm considers an investment project that requires an expenditure I0 today that will produce
expected cash flows πt in year t. Students in an introductory corporate finance course would
be taught to calculate the net present value of this project by discounting the future cash
flows at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate r, with,

NPV0 = −I0 +

T
X
t=0

πt
.
(1 + r)t

If NPV0 > 0, the firm should make the investment, while if NPV0 < 0, it should not.8
Now introduce a tax on the project’s future cash flows at a rate τ , and also allow the
firm to expense its initial investment, that is, to realize tax savings of τ I0 in the year of
investment.9 With this tax system in place, the project now has an after-tax NPV of NPVτ ,
with,

NPVτ = −I0 + τ I0 +

T
X
(1 − τ )πt
t=0

(1 + r)t

= (1 − τ )NPV0 .

Thus, under expensing, the government simply captures a fraction τ of the project’s NPV.
Crucially, any investment project with NPV0 > 0 that would be implemented in the absence
7

Again, note that the additional debt tax shields associated with an investment can actually result in a
net subsidy to investment under expensing or sufficiently accelerated depreciation.
8
In a more general setting, projects should be evaluated by considering the covariation of the project’s
cash flows with the pricing kernel or stochastic discount factor, that is, with the price of consumption in the
states of nature in which the project produces cash flows. For example, if µθt is the value at time zero of a
payout at time t in state of nature θt , then the value of a project that requires investments Iθt and produces
payouts πθt at time t in state of nature θt , will be,
NPV0 =

T
X
X

µθt (−Iθt + πθt ).

t=0 θt ∈Θt

It is again clear that under expensing, the after-tax NPV of the project is still simply (1 − τ )NPV0 .
9
Throughout the paper, I will assume that a firm’s taxable income is large enough for the firm to fully
utilize any tax deductions or credits. See Edgerton [2010] for a detailed treatment of the effects of investment
incentives on loss-making firms.

8

of taxation will also have NPVτ > 0, and thus it will still be implemented in the presence
of taxation. And any project that would not be implemented in the absence of taxation
(NPV0 < 0), will still not be implemented in the presence of taxation (because NPVτ < 0).10
This tax system does not alter investment decisions because the cost of investment and the
tax savings from the investment are realized at the same time, which ensures that the present
values of the tax payments and the tax deductions on marginal projects (with NP V = 0)
are exactly the same. It is easy to see that if the tax savings τ I0 in the model above were
realized in future years and were thus discounted, there could indeed be projects that would
have a positive NPV with no taxation, but a negative NPV with taxation. Under the current
U.S. tax system, for example, the tax savings from investment are not realized at the same
time as investment expenditures; rather they are realized in future years in accordance with
the depreciation schedules required by the tax code. As a result, few would disagree that
the current tax code discourages some investments that would be made in the absence of
taxation.

2.3

Accounting for investment and depreciation

When firms make an investment in physical capital, this spending appears as a capital expenditure on the cash flow statement, but it does not appear immediately on the earnings
statement. The “cost” of an investment appears on the earnings statement only as depreciation is deducted over the life of the investment, typically in a straight-line pattern.
Accounting for the tax savings associated with the depreciation of capital is another
issue. A key tenet of GAAP is the “matching principle,” or the notion that revenues and
expenses associated with the same activity should affect earnings at the same time. For
example, expenses associated with future repairs to goods sold under warranty are recorded
10

Note that this result and those that follow are relevant for a closed economy where the only decision is
to invest or not to invest. If firms instead can choose to locate an investment in one jurisdiction out of many
possibilities, then the jurisdictions with lower tax rates will be more attractive, even if all jurisdictions offer
expensing. Further research on the implications of accounting rules for international investment decisions
would be welcome.

9

when the goods are sold, even though the repairs have not yet been made. Application of
the matching principle to depreciation of investment goods requires that tax savings from
depreciation deductions be recognized in the same (straight-line) pattern that depreciation
itself is recognized, regardless of the timing of the tax savings that policymakers put into the
tax code. Although the timing of actual cash tax payments is affected by the depreciation
schedules in the tax code, the income tax expense reported in GAAP earnings is not.
This discrepancy between the timing of the accounting recognition of expenses for tax and
financial reporting purposes creates what is known as a “temporary book-tax difference.”11
The difference is only temporary because the total amount of depreciation deductions available for book and tax purposes is the same, but the time at which deductions are taken
differs. Tax depreciation typically exceeds book depreciation in the year an investment is
made, but, at some point in the future, book depreciation for the investment will exceed tax
depreciation. GAAP views any tax savings in excess of book depreciation early on as a “deferred tax liability” that will have to be “paid back” by the end of the life of the investment.
Eventually, the investment will have been fully depreciated for both tax and book purposes,
and the deferred tax liability will be zero.
Table 1 presents a simple numerical example to illustrate these accounting concepts. It
depicts a firm that is considering buying a machine for $36 in year 1. The machine produces
net sales of $20 in each of years 1 and 2, and it depreciates completely by the end of year 2,
so that it can produce nothing and has no salvage value. The firm is taxed on its profits at
a rate τ = 0.5, and it makes no interest payments.
The “Straight-line” columns depict the firm’s income and cash flows when book and tax
depreciation are both equal to straight-line depreciation of $18 per year. The firm’s earnings
in both years for both book and tax purposes are Sales ($20) - Depreciation ($18) - Current
Taxes ($1) = $1. In year 1, the firm’s cash flows are Sales ($20) - Current Taxes ($1) Capital Expenditure ($36) = -$17. In year 2, cash flows are Sales ($20) - Current Taxes ($1)
11

This table illustrates an example investment in a $36 machine that produces $20 of net
sales in each year and depreciates evenly over two years for book purposes. Switching from
straight-line depreciation for tax purposes to expensing shifts the project’s NPV of cash flows
from negative to positive, but it does not affect the project’s book earnings.

= $19.
The “Expensing” columns depict the same firm making the same investment when it may
expense the investment for tax purposes—that is, when it may deduct the entire purchase
price of the machine in the year it is puchased. We see that this treatment shifts $9 worth
of tax liability from year 1 into year 2 (line 6), and thus that $9 of cash flow is shifted
forward from year 2 to year 1 (line 8). With any positive discount rate, expensing thus
makes the project more attractive. The memo line shows that with a discount rate of 20%,
the project has a negative NPV under straight-line depreciation, but a positive NPV under
expensing. Thus, if the firm evaluates projects based on the NPV of their cash flows, a switch
to expensing would encourage this firm to make an investment that it otherwise would not
make.
Note, however, that expensing does not change the timing of book earnings (line 9).
Because the firm will still record $18 of book depreciation in both year 1 and year 2 (line
2), the matching principle dictates that it still book $18 of tax savings from depreciation
deductions in each year. Expensing has saved the firm $9 in cash in year 1, which it will
11

instead pay in year 2. GAAP, however, treats this saving as “Deferred Taxes,” which will
need to be “paid back” in year 2 (line 7), and thus still deducts the $1 in income tax expense
from earnings in year 1.
The key point, of course, is that expensing affects only the cash flow line and has no effect
at all on the earnings line. If a firm considers the cash flow line when evaluating whether to
undertake the investment, then expensing makes the net present value of making the investment larger. The more focus that the firm places on the earnings line when evaluating the
project, however, the smaller are the benefits of a switch to expensing (or of any acceleration
of depreciation deductions in the tax code). To summarize, if firms evaluate projects based
on any function of the projects’ streams of book earnings, then depreciation schedules in the
tax code have no effect on investment decisions.12
Note that with the tax rate of 0.5, earnings in each of year of the project are $1, while
with no taxes at all, earnings in each year would be $2. Thus the NPV of the earnings
from the project with taxes is exactly (1 − τ ) times the NPV of the earnings of the project
with no taxes (known as “Pretax Income”). This observation highlights a key insight of the
paper: the matching principle of GAAP enforces the same matching in time of the costs and
tax savings from investment that is the hallmark of expensing. The “cost” of an investment
under GAAP—the depreciation expense—must occur at the same time as the associated
benefit in the form of tax savings. Thus the present values of the tax payments and the
tax deductions on marginal projects (with NPV = 0) will always be equal regardless of the
tax rate, leaving the identity of the marginal project unchanged and the investment decision
undistorted, just as in the expensing example in the previous section. That is, every project
has a positive NPV after taxes if and only if it has a positive NPV with no taxes at all.13 To
summarize, if firms evaluate projects based on the NPV of the projects’ book earnings, the
12

Exceptions would arise if other parameters used in evaluating the stream of earnings depend on depreciation schedules. For example, it is possible that, in the long run, firms could move towards choosing projects
by discounting future earnings at rates that partially correct for the effect of depreciation deductions on cash
flows.
13
More explicitly, suppose a project will produce sales net of operating expenses πt and book depreciation

12

tax rate will have no effect on investment decisions.14
Note that one might well question the premise of this statement, that is, that NPV is
the function of earnings upon which investors and firms are focused. Indeed, some accounts
of the earnings fixation would suggest that firms are most concerned with smoothing the
volatility of earnings or with minimizing any shortfall in earnings relative to their or outsiders’
stated expectations. If these views are the correct ones, then the conclusion of the italicized
statement need not hold.
However, the insight in the statement is also somewhat more general than it first appears.
In fact, the result applies in any case where firms evaluate projects based on any weighted
sum of the earnings that the projects produce over time. As an example, equity analysts and
investors often calculate a “target price” for a firm’s stock using a multiple of earnings during
the past year or a projection of earnings during the coming year. That is, they arrive at a
valuation of the stock by multiplying the sum of earnings over some period by a constant,
where the constant is a target price-to-earnings ratio, perhaps based on the valuations of
comparable firms. If the firm’s manager’s objective is to maximize analysts’ valuation of
his stock, he will implement any investment project that increases earnings, and turn down
any project that decreases earnings. The neutrality of investment decisions with respect to
the tax rate is thus preserved, because any project that increases earnings in the absence
of taxation will still increase earnings in the presence of taxation (but by less so). Any
investment that would be made with τ = 0 will still be made if τ > 0.

If we introduce a tax at rate τ , the matching principle ensures that the tax savings from depreciation that
can be booked in each period must be equal to τ Dt . Thus, we can always write the NPV of the project’s
after-tax earnings as,

X
(1 − τ )πt − (1 − τ )Dt

much like we could under expensing.
14
Note that all of these statements apply only in the absence of the ITC, as does the original Hall and
Jorgenson [1967] result on the nondistortionary nature of expensing.

13

Note also the distinction between this second result and the earlier conclusion that a
focus on book earnings will mitigate any effect of changes in the depreciation schedules in
the tax code. This first conclusion is more robust to changes in the form of the earnings
fixation, because a move toward expensing has no effect at all on the time path of earnings.
For example, suppose a firm is considering a new investment, but narrowly decides against
the investment because depreciation deductions would push the firm’s earnings for the year
below analysts’ expectations. In this case, a stimulus package that included a sudden switch
to expensing would do little to alter the decision, because expensing does not matter for the
effect of the investment on the firm’s earnings.
Although studying the implications of a focus on other functions of the earnings stream
may well prove fruitful at some point, considering a firm as concerned with the NPV of both
its cash flows and its earnings seems a natural place to start. The next section of the paper
embeds such an assumption into a canonical investment model that can easily be taken to
the data.

3.1

A Model of the Firm
Terminology and Setup

Firms will maximize a discounted weighted average of their streams of after-tax cash flows
(CF t ) and their book earnings (BE t ). Define after-tax cash flows as,
CF t = (1 − τ )[F (Kt ) − pψ(It , Kt ) − rDt ] + Bt + τ δ T KtT − pIt (1 − ITC ),

where τ is the corporate tax rate and p is the unit price of capital. Kt is the capital stock,
and It is investment. Kt evolves according to,

K̇t = It − δKt

14

for depreciation δ. Dt is the stock of debt outstanding, and Bt is new borrowing. Dt evolves
according to,
Ḋt = Bt .
F is a net operating income function, which could incorporate maximization over variable
factors. The function ψ represents costs of adjustment from production slowdowns or worker
retraining associated with the installation of new capital. Investment It requires a cash
payment of pIt and entitles the firm to investment tax credit savings of pIt ITC .
The depreciation deductions permitted for tax purposes are determined by the stock of
the firm’s past capital expenditures that have not yet been used as a deduction from taxable
income. I denote this quantity by KtT , and I will hereafter refer to it as “tax capital.”
Deductions are allowed in the amount δ T KtT , so that tax capital evolves according to:
K̇tT = pIt − δ T KtT .
The tax savings afforded by these deductions are in the amount τ δ T KtT , and this term
appears in CF t above. The policy parameter δ T determines the extent to which depreciation
is accelerated for tax purposes.
Next define the firm’s accounting profits, or book earnings, as,

BE t = (1 − τ )[F (Kt ) − pψ(It , Kt ) − rDt − δ B KtB ] + pIt ITC .

Note that revenues F (Kt ), adjustment costs pψ(It , Kt ), interest payments rDt , and investment tax credits pIt ITC enter into both after-tax cash flows and book earnings.15 In lieu of

I have assumed here that firms use the “flow-through method” of accounting for the investment tax credit,
meaning that the credit is recognized as a reduction in income tax expense in the year of the investment.
Under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 4, in effect from 1964 through the repeal of the investment
tax credit in 1986, firms had the option to use either the flow-through method or the “deferral method,”
under which the credit is recognized gradually over the course of the life of the investment. Choosing the flowthrough method maximizes the present value of the tax savings from the credit, while choosing the deferral
method would smooth the savings over time. Consistent with the model developed in this paper, anecdotal
evidence suggests that most firms chose the flow-through method. For example, in their “Intermediate

the capital expenditure pIt and cash tax savings τ δ T KtT that appear in cash flows, there appears in book earnings a book measure of depreciation deductions δ B KtB and their associated
tax savings τ δ B KtB . Much like tax capital, book capital evolves according to,
K̇tB = pIt − δ B KtB .

The difference between after-tax cash flows and book earnings is,

CF t − BE t = δ B KtB + τ (δ T KtT − δ B KtB ) − pIt + Bt .

These terms should be familiar to anyone acquainted with the reconciliation of earnings

of accounting for the investment credit is far more commonly used in practice.”

and cash flows that appears in firms’ Statement of Cash Flows under GAAP. Beginning with
book earnings, one adds back the noncash charges for depreciation (δ B KtB ) and deferred
taxes (τ (δ T KtT − δ B KtB )) to reach Cash Flow from Operating Activities. To Cash Flow
from Operating Activities, we add Cash Flow from Investing Activities (−pIt ), and Cash
Flow from Financing Activities (Bt ), to reach total Net Cash Flow. Tables 2 and 3 present
the income and cash flow statements that would appear in SEC filings or annual reports
presented under US GAAP for the firm in the model.

3.2

Investment Policy

I assume that the firm places a weight α on book earnings (BE) and a weight (1 − α) on
after-tax cash flows (CF) when choosing its investment. The firm solves,

max

{It ,Bt }

Z

e−rt [αBE t + (1 − α)CF t ] dt

subject to,

K̇t = It − δKt
K̇tB = pIt − δ B KtB
K̇tT = pIt − δ T KtT
Ḋt =Bt
Dt ≤D̄.

The final constraint crudely prevents the firm from choosing to be fully debt financed, which
would otherwise be optimal.16 This problem is very similar to a standard investment problem,
with two important differences. First, it is traditionally assumed that α = 0 and the firm
16

The specification of this constraint can matter for the effective tax burden on capital when the limit on
borrowing or debt depends on the amount of investment or the size of the capital stock. It does not, however,
affect the relative impact of accelerated depreciation and the ITC, so I abstract from these complications
here.

17

considers only its cash flows. Second, there are now three types of capital stocks that the
firm must track. The stock of physical capital, Kt , is familiar from traditional models, but I
have now introduced accounting measures of this stock for both book and tax purposes, KtB
and KtT .
From this model, with no adjustment costs (ψ = 0), I derive the user cost of capital,
F ′ (Kt ) =


(r + δ)p
1 − α + αz B − τ [(1 − α)z T + αz B ] − ITC ,
1−τ

(1)

where z T and z B are the present values of depreciation deductions for tax and book purposes,
respectively.17 Derivations appear in an appendix. When α = 0, the user cost expression
found in (1) simplifies to the one in Hall and Jorgenson [1967],

(r + δ)p
1 − τ z T − ITC .

F ′ (Kt ) =

Thus the model shows how this canonical expression should be modified if a firm cares about
its book earnings in addition to its cash flows. Namely, the optimal level of the capital stock
will also reflect α, the weight placed on book earnings, and z B , the present value of future
depreciation deductions for book purposes.
Define the tax wedge as the distortion to the return on a marginal dollar of investment
that is induced by the tax system:

distortion. Figure 1 plots the tax wedge as a a function of z T for α = 0, α = 0.5, and α = 1,
with r = 0.05, τ = 0.35 and ITC = 0. I set δ = 0.03, roughly the rate of depreciation on
nonresidential structures.18 First, note that the tax wedge is still zero under full expensing
(z T = 1), no matter the value of α. Second, note that the tax wedge is zero if α = 1,
regardless of the tax parameters. As I argued based on the example in section 2.3 above,
the book treatment of depreciation resembles expensing, in that deductions for depreciation
and their associated tax savings appear contemporaneously. If firms focus entirely on the
NPV of book earnings, then there is no distortion to investment imposed by the tax rate.19
18

See, for example, Gravelle [1994].
Tax distortions are often described using effective tax rates (ETRs), where the tax wedge above is
expressed as a percentage of the pre-tax, tax-distorted rate of return. This exercise is complicated a bit in
this setting by the fact that a focus on book earnings would already distort, in a sense, the firm’s investment
choice relative to its choice if it focused entirely on cash flows. In fact, it would distort investment upwards,
since the “cost” of investment is reduced from p to pz B , the present value of future book depreciation
deductions. Since changes in α shift the denominator of the ETR as well as the numerator, the ETR
calculated in this way can either increase or decrease with α, depending on the value of z B relative to
economic depreciation. I judge that the tax wedge discussed in the text is thus the best way of summarizing
the effects of the tax system on incentives for investment when α may vary.
Regarding the potential for a focus on book earnings to distort investment upwards, it is important to
19

19

As z T falls below 1, the tax wedge rises less quickly when α > 0 than when α = 0. The
departure from expensing induces less distortion when α > 0 because it affects only cash
flows and not book earnings. These results suggest that the distortion to the capital stock
created by the corporate income tax is smaller than we would calculate if we assumed that
firms did not include book earnings in their objective function. Likewise, a policy change
that moves towards expensing would have smaller effects than we might otherwise anticipate.
For example, under current law, most business investments in structures are depreciated
over 39 years. The present discounted value of the depreciation deductions associated with
$1 of investment in business structures is not far from $0.55. If α = 0, then Figure 1 suggests
that the tax wedge on equity-financed business structures is about 2 percentage points (on
a base around 5%, for a rate of 40%). A switch to expensing would drastically reduce the
tax wedge from 2% to zero. If, however, α = 0.5, then the tax wedge on structures is only 1
percentage point to begin with, and a switch to expensing would produce only half as large
a reduction in the tax wedge.

3.3

Estimating α

With adjustment costs nonzero, I solve for the derivative of the adjustment cost function,

ψI =

λ0
p0

− 1 − α + αz B − τ [(1 − α)z T + αz B ] − ITC
1−τ



,

(2)

where λ0 /p is the shadow value to the firm of a marginal dollar of capital, or Q. With α = 0,
this simplifies to an expression like one in Summers [1981],

ψI =

λ0
p

− 1 − τ z T − ITC
1−τ



,

remember that other features of the separation of ownership and control, namely investors’ uncertainty
that managers will pay out the returns to their investments, would tend to distort aggregate investment
downwards. Most commentators seem to think that aggregate savings and investment rates are “too low” in
some sense, so I find it most natural to think about taxation exacerbating this downward distortion rather
than correcting an upward distortion.

20

known as “tax-adjusted Q.” Again, the model shows us how a canonical investment function
should be modified if a firm cares about its book earnings in addition to its cash flows.
In particular, with α > 0, we find new implications for the effects of the tax policy
variables. First, note that changes to the investment tax credit, ITC , are no longer equivalent
to changes to depreciation allowances, τ z T . That is,

If α were equal to zero, these two forms of investment incentives would have the same effect.
Now, however, the effects of depreciation allowances are mitigated because they do not affect
book earnings in the way that the ITC does.
In principle, α can be estimated quite easily. Under the familiar assumption of quadratic
adjustment costs,

we reach a linear expression for the investment ratio,

In theory, the same coefficient c should multiply both marginal Q (that is, λ0 /p) and the tax
variables. When estimating c, however, some measure of the market value of a firm divided
by the replacement cost of its capital must be used as a proxy for marginal Q. The poor
performance of these measures in investment equations, particularly when compared to cash
flow variables, has inspired many attempts to solve the potential problem of measurement
error in marginal Q. Examples include Cummins, Hassett, and Hubbard [1994], Erickson
and Whited [2000], and Cummins, Hassett, and Oliner [2006].
Desai and Goolsbee [2004] take a particularly simple and transparent approach to dealing
with this measurement error for the purpose of isolating the effects of the tax variables. They

where subscripts index firm i in industry j in year t. That is, they simply allow different coefficient estimates on the “Q” and “tax term” components of tax-adjusted Q, so that problems
measuring Q do not improperly attenuate estimates of the effects of the tax variables.
I take a very similar approach by simply noting that the expression in (3) above can be
written,

then the ratio β2 /β1 identifies (1 − α).
Note that (4) suggests that other coefficients might also be of use in estimating α. However, I would not expect the coefficient on the Q term to provide useful information due
to the well-known attenuation problems discussed above. The penultimate term will be absorbed by year fixed effects. The last term involving z B , the present value of depreciation
deductions for book purposes, will largely be absorbed by firm fixed effects.20
20

One might note, however, that this term could change somewhat over time as each firm’s investment mix
evolves and as interest rates change. One could consider constructing a time-varying measure of z B from the
information on book depreciation charges in Compustat to include in my regressions, but this exercise strikes
me as unlikely to produce much more than noise. I will thus include no controls for z B beyond firm fixed
effects. Some readers could then worry that the omission of z B from the equation above will bias empirical
estimates. For this concern to be valid, however, one would need to assume that α > 0 and thus that the
null hypothesis to be tested can already be rejected.

22

The model just presented provides an explicit theoretical foundation for the equation to
be estimated, but this specification is also intuitively appealing. Results will take the form
of simple, transparent OLS regressions of investment ratios on tax variables, controlling
for variables like Q (and cash flows) that are known to affect investment decisions. These
results are also straightforward modifications of specifications that have a long history in the
literature on taxes and investment, and thus should be familiar to readers of this literature.
Finally, the key result is a simple, intuitive comparison of two coefficients. The hypothesis
developed in the paper thus far suggests that tax incentives for investment that affect both
book earnings and cash flows should have more impact than those that affect only cash flows.
A simple comparison of the coefficients on the ITC and accelerated depreciation provides an
intuitively appealing test of this hypothesis.

Data

Following many prior papers in the literature, I use firm-level financial statement data from
Compustat to construct measures of investment, Q, and cash flows. I also construct tax
variables that reflect repeated changes in corporate tax laws in the United States over the
last several decades. Legislation changed corporate tax rates in 1964, 1968, 1970, 1979, and
1987. There were important changes to depreciation rules in 1962, 1971, 1981, and 1987.
Bonus depreciation was in place from 2002 to 2004 (and again from 2008 through 2012, so
far). The investment tax credit was introduced in 1962, repealed in 1969, reinstated in 1971,
increased in 1975, and repealed in 1986.21 These changes have often differentially affected
investments in different assets in rather arbitrary ways. As one example, the Tax Reform
Act of 1986 changed the investment tax credit available for trucks from 10% to 0%, while it
It is also worth noting that firms appear to have some discretion over their choice of depreciation method
for book purposes, and a small literature examines this choice, for example, Keating and Zimmerman [1999].
The interaction of this choice with firm investment decisions is a bit beyond the scope of this paper, but
would be an interesting topic for future research.
21
Note that all variation in the ITC thus occurs in data that is more than twenty years old. I would be
delighted to see future research designs capable of testing the hypotheses from this paper using more recent
data.

23

changed the ITC available for cars from 6% to 0%.22
I follow Cummins, Hassett, and Hubbard [1994], Desai and Goolsbee [2004], and others
in using this variation in the tax treatment of different kinds of assets to identify the effect
of tax variables on investment. I thank Dale Jorgenson for providing data on investment
tax credits and the present value of depreciation deductions available in each year for each
asset type. I collected additional information on the depreciation deduction available in the
year of investment from IRS publications. These variables are matched to the 1997 Capital
Flows table from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which records the amount of investment
made by each industry in each asset category.23 I construct depreciation deduction values
and investment tax credit rates at the industry level by taking a weighted average across the
assets purchased by each industry, with the weights equal to the percentage of the industry’s
spending accounted for by each asset. I then construct the tax term components of taxadjusted Q,
Tax termit ≡

τt zjt + ITC jt
,
1 − τt

for firm i in industry j and year t. The tax term is constructed separately for equipment
investment and structures investment. Note that the tax term does not vary across firms
within each industry-year combination, so it is not possible to control for variation at the
industry-year level by including industry-year dummies in regressions.
Tax terms constructed in this manner depend only on statutory variables like the corporate tax rate, depreciation schedules, and investment tax credit parameters.24 These
variables are averaged at the industry level using a set of weights that are fixed over time
22

See Brazell, Dworin, and Walsh [1989], Cummins, Hassett, and Hubbard [1994], or Gravelle [1994] for
more on the history of relevant tax policy.
23
There are 28 equipment categories, with examples including Computers and Peripheral Equipment,
Metalworking Machinery, and Autos. There are 23 structures categories, with examples including Industrial
Buildings, Railroads, and Petroleum Pipelines. There are 123 industries, which are roughly at the threedigit NAICS level. Examples include Coal Mining, Plastic and Rubber Products Manufacturing, and Air
Transportation.
24
I ignore any progressivity in the corporate tax rate schedule that would create different marginal rates
in a narrow range of incomes near zero. The present value of depreciation deductions also varies somewhat
over time with the interest rates used to do the discounting. These calculations were done by Dale Jorgenson
using the after-tax BAA rate.

24

and do not vary with any (possibly tax-induced) changes in the mix of assets employed by
a given industry. Thus, there is no mechanical relation between the decisions of firms in
Compustat and changes in the tax variables that are included in regression results. Further,
I present specifications that include year fixed effects to deflect concerns about policy endogeneity that would arise, for example, when investment incentives become more generous
exactly when investment is low. With year fixed effects included, identification of the effects
of tax variables comes only from differences across industries in changes in the tax treatment
of the assets that they purchase (with the bundle of assets held fixed) and not from time
series variation in the generosity of tax incentives. I present results from the sample period
1962 to 2005.25

All specifications presented in the paper include firm fixed effects. Column 1 does not include
year fixed effects; column 2 does include them. Thus we might expect the tax coefficients in
the column 1 to be biased downward by policy endogeneity if accelerated depreciation and
the ITC are used as counter-cyclical policy tools. The results in the table are consistent with
this story. That is, the coefficient on the tax term for equipment is smaller in magnitude
when excluding year effects than when including them. The coefficient on the tax term for
structures is actually negative when excluding the year effects (consistent with tax incentives
for structures investment becoming more generous in years when investment was low) and
25

Edgerton [2010] finds that the effects of investment incentives may be mitigated in firms that lose money
or have low cash flows. As losses have been high and cash flows low during the bonus depreciation episodes of
the 2000s, one could worry that that these episodes would improperly depress the coefficients on accelerated
depreciation. Prior versions of the paper, however, used samples through 1990 for this reason, and estimates
of α were little different.

25

essentially zero when including them. The results that tax incentives for equipment are
more effective than those for structures (and that, in general, structures investment is more
difficult to explain than equipment investment) have a long history in the literature. I thus
focus in these results on the equipment tax term.
The results in column 2 are quite similar to those of Desai and Goolsbee [2004] in that the
coefficient on the “Tax Term”, (τ z T + ITC )/(1 − τ ), is economically important. When clustering standard errors at the firm level, Desai and Goolsbee [2004] find it to be statistically
significant as well. However, in this setting where the annual variation in the tax variables
occurs only at the industry level, it is appropriate to cluster standard errors at the industry
level. Column 2 shows that the Desai and Goolsbee [2004] result is no longer statistically
significant at conventional levels when clustering by industry, although it is significant at the
21% level. Note, however, that standard errors are much smaller in column 1, which also
exploits time series variation in the tax variables that is absorbed by the year dummies in
column 2. As we should expect policy endogeneity to bias the tax term coefficient downward
in column 1, this specification still provides evidence of an economically important effect of
the tax variables on investment that is also robustly statistically significant
In columns 3 through 8 of Table 4, the terms on the right-hand side are rearranged as in
Equation 5 above. The equipment tax term is split into two parts—one for the present value
of depreciation deductions τ z T , and the other for the ITC. The even-numbered columns
include year fixed effects; the odd-numbered columns do not. The distribution of investment
is highly skewed towards the largest firms, so it is useful to test whether results hold in
samples consisting only of large firms. The sample in columns 3 and 4 include all Compustat
firms, columns 5 and 6 include only the largest 3000 firms when ranked by assets in the
previous year, and columns 7 and 8 include only the largest 500 firms each year.

Estimates of α range from .169 in column 8 to 0.814 in column 6, with the other four
estimates all close to 0.5. The equality of the τ z T and ITC coefficients can be rejected with
95% confidence in columns 3, 5 and 7, and with 90% confidence in column 4. The p-value in
the test of the null hypothesis of coefficient equality in column 6 is 0.138. Only in column 8,
which includes year dummies and limits the sample to the largest 500 firms in each year, is
the difference between coefficients not close to statistical significance. It is worth noting also
that the estimated magnitude of the overall effect of the tax variables tends to decline as the
sample is limited to larger and larger firms. As the larger firms have a far larger effect on
aggregate investment, this suggests that the baseline results from Desai and Goolsbee [2004]
would tend to overstate the magnitude of the effect of tax variables on aggregate investment
because they weight the small firms equally.
Table 5 presents results to address the concern that τ z T may mismeasure the value of
depreciation deductions relative to investment tax credits. As calculated, z T reflects assumptions about the discount rate applied to future depreciation deductions. If these assumptions
are incorrect, estimated coefficients could be attenuated by classical measurement error or
otherwise biased. Further, the investment tax credit may provide additional cash flows in
the year of investment, making it more effective than accelerating depreciation deductions
from one future year to another. Table 5 addresses these concerns by estimating a separate
coefficient for depreciation deductions available in the year an investment is made. These
deductions need not be discounted and have the same cash flow benefits as the ITC.
Table 5 provides little reason to worry that the observed lack of responsiveness to accel-

erated depreciation is driven by discounting or cash flows. The estimates of α coming from
a comparison of the coefficient on the ITC and on the first-year depreciation deduction are
a bit lower than those in Table 4 in the even-numbered specifications which include year
dummies, but are actually higher in the specifications without year dummies. In fact, the
estimated coefficient on the first-year depreciation deduction is actually slightly negative
in the odd-numbered columns without year dummies. Again this is consistent with policy
endogeneity in the form of depreciation being accelerated into the first year during downturns in investment. In columns with year dummies, there is little difference between the
coefficients on the first-year depreciation deduction and those on the discounted, future deductions. Thus it seems that there is little reason to believe that the results in Table 4 are
driven by discounting or cash flows.

5.1

Discussion

Some might also worry that an exercise comparing two coefficients like this one is easily
confounded by measurement error.26 One could worry here that depreciation deductions—
even in the first year, when they need not be discounted—are measured less accurately
than the investment tax credit, inappropriately producing more attenuated coefficients on
depreciation deductions than on the ITC. I see little reason, however, to suspect that more
errors would arise in identifying the correct depreciation schedule for an asset than the correct
ITC amount. In fact, the ITC amounts were determined based on the same equipment
categories as the depreciation schedules.
There is, however, one important sense in which the statutory maximum depreciation
deduction available in the first year that I include in Table 5 mismeasures the depreciation
deductions that firms actually used. Namely, firms often did not claim the most accelerated depreciation schedule that was available to them. Congress explicitly authorized the
26

Note first that using the industry-level average tax variables for each firm does not itself create classical
measurement error. OLS with right-hand-side variables replaced by group means is unbiased in situations
where OLS is unbiased, as long as the group selection is not correlated with the error term.

use of double declining balance depreciation in 1954 (Brazell, Dworin, and Walsh [1989]),
but Jorgenson and Sullivan [1981] report that a substantial fraction of investment was still
depreciated using straight line methods up until the mandatory adoption of the Accelerated
Cost Recovery System in 1981. A similar lack of take-up has been reported for recent bonus
depreciation incentives by Knittel [2007]. I would not consider this discrepancy between
statutory maximum deductions and the deductions actually taken by firms to be measurement error—rather, I would consider it a reflection of the phenomenon under study. Firms
do not appear to value accelerated depreciation as much as economists think they should.
Still, one must wonder if this apparent undervaluation of depreciation deductions results
not from the accounting channel which I study in this paper, but from other facets of
accelerated depreciation. A prime candidate would be the complexity of the depreciation
rules. Firms may have simply preferred to stick with straight line depreciation after double
declining balance was available because the calculations were simpler. Firms may opt to
continue claiming depreciation under the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System rather
than claiming bonus depreciation because they are already familiar with the MACRS rules
or because state-level tax laws did not always change to allow bonus depreciation. It is
hard, however, to square this story with the economist’s typical view of firms—particularly
the large publicly-traded firms in Compustat—as coldly calculating profit-maximizers with
teams of accountants and lawyers ready to wring savings from the tax code. Particularly in
recent years, tax accounting software should make it essentially costless for firms to maximize
their depreciation deductions.
One could also wonder if there are other aspects of the tax code that might make depreciation deductions less attractive than ITCs. One might ask, for example, if firms in a
loss position benefit more from ITCs than from accelerated depreciation. I see little reason,
however, why this should be the case. It was true from 1964 to 1976 that an ITC could be
carried forward for 7 years and a loss for only 5, but this could make only a trivial difference
for their relative values.

31

One might also wonder if the the ITC was used as a temporary stimulus tool, potentially
boosting its measured effectiveness if firms respond more strongly to incentives that are about
to expire. However, I see little reason to think that the ITC should have been perceived as
more “temporary” than depreciation provisions. The ITC was made a “permanent” part of
the tax code in 1962 before being repealed in 1969, and was then again made “permanent”
in 1972. In the late 1970’s, the rate was “temporarily” increased, but then this increase
was made “permanent” in 1978, before the entire credit was repealed in 1986 (see Gravelle
[1994]). On the depreciation side, early rules were “permanent,” but, in fact, they changed
in 1962, 1971, 1981, and 1987. Bonus depreciation was explicitly introduced as temporary in
2002 and did indeed expire in 2004 after being extended once. The “temporary” provisions
introduced in 2008 are now in their fifth year after being extended three times. Thus, parts
of both the ITC and accelerated depreciation have been called “temporary” at times during
the sample period, but their labeling as temporary or permanent seems to have had relatively
little relation to their actual lifetimes, which have been similar across the two policies.
One could also wonder if the timing of investment during the year might affect the two
kinds of incentives differently. It is true that the depreciation deductions available from
an investment can sometimes depend on the month during the year when an investment is
placed in service. If a large portion of investments were placed in service during the last
quarter of the year and thus qualified for less than the standard first-year deduction, the
variables used in regressions here could overstate the true value of depreciation deductions to
many firms. However, data from the Census Bureau indicate that seasonality in equipment
investment is relatively muted.27 Thus, it again seems that any effect on the true value of
27

I checked the seasonality of shipments by US manufacturers of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft
and parts, which are the primary data used in construction of the investment figures in the National Income
and Product Accounts. Over the last 19 years, a period for which consistent data are readily available,
nominal shipments of capital goods averaged less than 3% higher in the second half of the year than in the
first, and only about 4% higher in the fourth quarter than in the average of the first three. Note that under
current law, firms may adopt the “half-year” convention of depreciating all equipment under the standard
schedule that essentially assumes that equipment is placed in service at the mid-point of the year, unless
more than 40% of annual investment occurred in the fourth quarter. In this case, all equipment (including
that from the first three quarters of the year) must be depreciated under the assumption that it was placed
in service at the mid-point of the quarter in which it was placed in service. That is, the firms that must

32

depreciation deductions must be trivial.
In summary, the most obvious alternative explanations for the weaker effect of accelerated
depreciation do not receive much support from the data.

Conclusions

A large literature and a great deal of survey and anecdotal evidence suggests that both investors and managers are quite focused on firms’ accounting profits as a primary measure of
their performance. This paper has developed and tested the implications of this claim for the
effect of tax policy on firm investment decisions. I modeled a firm that places some weight
on both its cash flows and its accounting profits when making investment decisions, and I
showed how this assumption translates into simple modifications of canonical results from
Hall and Jorgenson [1967] and Summers [1981]. I estimated the weight placed on accounting
profits using an equation derived from the model that is also a straightforward extension
of specifications that have featured prominently in the tax and investment literature, particularly in Desai and Goolsbee [2004]. Results would suggest that firms do indeed place a
significant weight on accounting profits when making investment decisions. As a result, the
rate of taxation on corporate income may impose smaller distortions on investment decisions
than it otherwise would, but accelerated depreciation provisions may also be less effective.
In truth, I view these results as a “first pass” at the question of whether the accounting
system could affect firms’ real investment responses to taxation. It seems hard to overstate
how often accountants, businesspeople, and various other commentators repeat the claim
that firms care deeply about their accounting profits. This claim has clear implications for
the effectiveness of tax incentives for investment—incentives that affect accounting profits
should have more effect than incentives that affect only cash flows. This paper’s empirical
work could be seen as the simplest possible test of whether the data on investment might be
take reduced depreciation deductions for their investments late in the year may also take more generous
deductions for investments early in the year, and thus these will tend to balance out.

33

consistent with this oft-repeated claim. And, in fact, it seems that they are. In straightforward investment regressions with a long pedigree in the tax literature, it is indeed the case
that accelerated depreciation has smaller effects on investment than does the investment tax
credit, just as those making the claim would predict.
I find it unlikely, however, that anyone with a healthy skepticism toward empirical work
would be unwaveringly convinced that the accounting system is driving these results. Although I have been unable to identify any clearly compelling alternative explanations, it is
hard not to harbor some suspicion that other factors might be at work. Further research
attempting to measure any effect of the accounting system on investment responses to tax
policy would be most welcome.

This table contains descriptive statistics for the full sample of 128,023 observations on 12,457 unique
firms that is used in regressions presented in the text. The sample is truncated at the 99th percentile of
the investment, Q, and cashflow variables and at the 1st percentile of the cash flow variable. I follow prior
literature in constructing these variables. The dependent variable in all regressions is the investment to
capital stock ratio easily observed in Compustat,

I follow Kaplan and Zingales [1997] in constructing a measure of Q, which is intended to proxy for the
increase in the value of the firm’s cash flows created by a marginal dollar of capital, or λt /pt . Desai and
Goolsbee [2004] show that this “corporate finance Q” performs better in investment regressions than the
“public finance Q” constructed a bit differently by Cummins, Hassett, and Hubbard [1994]. I construct,

Qt =

prcc199t × csho25t + at6t − ceq60t − txdb74t
.
at6t

In essence, this ratio is the market value of equity plus the book value of liabilities, excluding deferred taxes,
divided by the book value of assets. This variable appears in regressions divided by 1 − τt , for τt the current
statutory tax rate, in accordance with the model presented in the text.

39

I again follow Kaplan and Zingales [1997] in constructing a cash flow measure,

CashFlow t =

ib18t + dp14t
.
ppent8t−1

This ratio is Income Before Extraordinary Items plus Depreciation and Amortization, scaled by the capital
stock at the beginning of the year.
