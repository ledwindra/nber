On the Origins of Risk-Taking

JEL No. G11,J01
ABSTRACT
Risk-taking behavior is highly correlated between parents and their children; however, little is known
about the extent to which these relationships are genetic or determined by environmental factors. We
use data on stock market participation of Swedish adoptees and relate this to the investment behavior
of both their biological and adoptive parents. We find that stock market participation of parents increases
that of children by about 34% and that both pre-birth and post-birth factors are important. However,
once we condition on having positive financial wealth, we find that nurture has a much stronger influence
on risk-taking by children, and the evidence of a relationship between stock-holding of biological parents
and their adoptive children becomes very weak. We find similar results when we study the share of
financial wealth that is invested in stocks. This suggests that a substantial proportion of risk-attitudes
and behavior is environmentally determined.

1. Introduction
Parents who hold riskier financial portfolios have children who themselves hold
riskier financial portfolios. In the United States, children with a parent who owned stocks
in 1984 were 16 percentage points more likely to own stocks themselves in 1999 (Charles
and Hurst, 2003). In Sweden, children with at least one parent who owned stocks in 2000
were 22 percentage points more likely to own stocks themselves in that same year. The
intergenerational persistence of risky market participation and its determinants are
important, first and foremost, because of their welfare implications; historically, risky
market investment has had a higher return compared to safer financial assets such as
bonds and money market funds. Thus, to the extent that risk-taking behavior is correlated
with wealth, these behaviors can exacerbate or mitigate wealth inequality over time. Also
important, understanding the determinants of risky market investment provides evidence
on the determinants of risky behavior more generally.
But why is risk-taking correlated across generations? Does this have to do with
genetic or innate characteristics that are correlated across generations (such as innate risk
preferences), or is it that children learn from parents, and risk-taking behavior is acquired
over one’s lifetime?2 Is it nature or is it nurture? To provide insight into this question, we
take advantage of a unique feature of the Swedish adoption system whereby we observe
both the biological and adoptive parents of adopted children. We use administrative data
on the portfolio choices of a large sample of adopted children born between 1950 and
1980 merged with similar information for their biological and adoptive parents--as well
as corresponding data on own-birth children. We disentangle the role of nature versus

Recent research in gene-mapping suggests that specific genes are associated with risk attitudes and risktaking behavior. See, for example, Kuhnen and Chiao (2009) and Dreber et al. (2009).

nurture in the intergenerational transmission of risky behavior by looking at how the risk
taking behavior of adoptive children is related to that of both their biological and
adoptive parents. Adoption allows us to examine the effects of environmental factors in a
situation where children have no genetic relationship with their (adoptive) parents.3
Our paper relates to an active literature that documents intergenerational
correlations in both risk preferences and asset allocations. Charles and Hurst (2003),
Hryshko, Luengo-Prado, and Sorensen (2011), Dohmen, et al. (2012), and Kimball, Sahm,
and Shapiro (2009) all document similarities in self-reported attitudes towards risk across
generations. The same tendency in the choice of assets across generations has been
documented by Chiteji and Stafford (1999) and Charles and Hurst (2003), among others.
To distinguish between genetic and environmental determinants of risky financial
behavior, the literature has focused on twins studies.4 Cesarini et al. (2010) and Barnea,
Cronqvist, and Siegel (2010) both use differences between identical and fraternal twins to
decompose the cross-sectional variation in investor behavior. Interestingly, they find very
little, if any, role for shared environmental factors, suggesting that parental influences on

Adoption studies have been widely used by economists in other contexts to determine the relative roles of
genes and environment in influencing economic behavior. Important adoption studies include Plug and
Vijverberg (2003), Plug (2004), and Sacerdote (2007). Recent studies using Swedish data include the
seminal study of Björklund, Lindahl, and Plug (2006) who studied educational attainment and earnings.
Since then, the Swedish data have been used to study voting (Cesarini, Johannesson, and Oskarsson, 2012),
crime (Hjalmarsson and Lindquist, 2013), entrepreneurship (Lindquist, Sol, and Van Praag, 2015), and
health (Lindahl et al. 2015). These studies have found evidence that both characteristics of biological and
adoptive parents are predictive of child outcomes.

More generally, Dohmen et al. (2012) use data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP)
and find evidence of environmental influences in the determination of child risk attitudes net of parental
risk attitudes, suggesting that both nature and nurture play a role.

children only operate through genetic channels. 5 However, the twin approach is
fundamentally different from what we do with adoption data in that it decomposes the
total variation in asset allocation into genetic and environmental factors; it does so by
making relatively strong assumptions about the similarities in environment and genetics
across fraternal and identical twins. Our approach studies the intergenerational
association and relies on an entirely different set of assumptions. Because of the
differences in the methodologies and goals, the approaches can be seen as complements
rather than substitutes.
We find evidence for important effects of both genes and environment on the
decision to hold stocks, implying a role for both genetic transmission of risk attitudes as
well as environmental influences. However, once we condition on positive financial
wealth, which is correlated with both biological and adoptive parents risk-taking, we find
that nurture has a much stronger influence on risk-taking by children. We find similar
results when we study the share of financial wealth that is invested in stocks. Importantly,
these results do not appear to be driven by the amount of parental wealth or even
children’s wealth holdings, education, or income, once we condition on positive financial
wealth holding of children. These conclusions are robust to a variety of robustness and
specification checks. Our findings of strong environmental effects stand in stark contrast
to the existing work using variation induced by twins that shows a role for biological but
not shared environmental elements in determining risk-taking.
The structure of the paper is as follows. In the next section, we discuss the

For example, Barnea, Cronqvist, and Siegel (2010, p593) state: “While parents have a significant impact
on their children’s asset allocation and the riskiness of chosen portfolios, this influence is found to be
through their genes and not through parenting or other non-genetic sources”.

institutional background both in terms of financial markets and the adoption process. In
section 3, we outline the econometric methodology and, in section 4, we describe the data.
Section 5 has estimates for the intergenerational transmission of stock-holding, including
specifications that allow for interactions between nature and nurture and differences by
the gender of the child. In Section 6, we present a variety of robustness and specification
tests, including testing the sensitivity of our results to the potential non-random
assignment of children to adoptive parents and the choice of years of data. Section 7
discusses the external validity of our results, and Section 8 concludes.

2. Institutional Background
A. Financial Wealth in Sweden
Stock market participation rates are higher in Sweden than in many other
countries such as the United States (Guiso, Haliassos, and Jappelli, 2001). In addition, a
large proportion of financial wealth is held outside of pension funds: Non-retirement
wealth accounts for almost 84 percent of aggregate household financial wealth (Calvet,
Campbell, and Sodini 2007), and it is this form of wealth that is the focus of our study.
However, it is important to understand the nature of the pension system due to its
potential effect on savings.
Relative to countries such as the U.S., Sweden’s pension system would be
considered quite generous. Sweden has a mix of public and private pension schemes, and
individuals are allocated to different pension systems depending on the public or private
sector affiliation and year of birth of the individual. The longer one works, the higher the
pension one receives. The retirement age is flexible and individuals can claim retirement

benefits beginning at age 61.6
Because we examine both male and female investment behavior separately, it is
important to understand whether there are incentives to transfer wealth holdings from one
spouse to another. There do not appear to be any such incentives. In the event of a
divorce, in the absence of a prenuptial agreement, all assets are split equally among
spouses. For wealth tax purposes, the value of jointly owned assets was split evenly
between the two tax filers. Thus, there were no incentives for husbands and wives to
strategically allocate assets between themselves in order to reduce their wealth tax bill.
Finally, people who face greater labor income risk may be less likely to choose
risky financial portfolios. Consequently, the unemployment insurance system could
potentially affect individuals’ risk-taking behavior in financial markets; a more generous
system could create an incentive to take more risk with one’s portfolio. In 2000, while the
formal replacement rate was at 80 percent of wages, the effective replacement rate taking
earnings-ceilings into account was around 65 percent (Carling, Holmlund, and Vejsiu
2001).7 Because of this, it is difficult to imagine that high risky market participation in

In 2000, when we measure asset allocation, the public pension system almost entirely consisted of a
national pension plan financed on a pay-as-you-go basis (an individual account system known as the
Premium Pension System (PPS) was introduced in 1999 but, because these funds were so new, investment
in the PPS funds was very low when we are measuring asset allocation). In addition, most people receive
an occupational pension from their employer. According to the Swedish Pensions Agency, about 90% of
employees receive some pension benefits from their employer as a condition of employment. On average,
around 4.5% of the employee's salary is put into employer provided schemes (Thörnqvist and Vardardottir,
2014). Swedish residents also have tax incentives to invest in private pension savings that are only
accessible after retirement. However, as mentioned earlier, individuals still hold a substantial fraction of
their wealth in non-retirement wealth. There is also a guaranteed pension for those who have had little or no
income from work, and the size of this guaranteed pension is based on how long the person has lived in
Sweden. In 2000, the maximum guaranteed pension, which applies to those who have lived in Sweden for
at least 40 years, is 2394 SEK per month ($254) before taxes for those who are married, and 2928 SEK per
month ($311) for a single person. A tax rate of 30 percent is then applied.
7

There is an earnings ceiling above which no additional benefits are paid. In 1996, it was estimated that 75
percent of employees had monthly earnings exceeding the ceiling (Bharadwaj et al. 2014).

Sweden compared to many other countries can be explained by the “generous”
unemployment insurance system.

B. The Adoption System8
The adoptees we study were born between 1950 and 1980. During this period,
private adoptions were illegal, so all adoptions went through the state. The state collected
information on both the biological and adoptive parents; while it only required
information on the biological mother, in many cases, social workers were also able to
identify the biological fathers. About 80% of children were adopted in their first year of
life.9
In order to adopt a child, a family had to satisfy certain requirements. The
adoptive parents had to be married and be at least 25 years old, have appropriate housing,
and be free of tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases. The adoptive father was
required to have a steady income and the adoptive mother was required to be able to stay
home with the child for a certain period of time.10 Overall, the adoption criteria meant
that the adoptive parents were positively selected relative to the general population.
While matching of children to adoptive parents was at the discretion of the

See Bjorklund, Lindahl, and Plug (2006) and Lindquist, Sol, and Van Praag (2015) for more details.

Upon turning 18, an adopted child has the legal right to obtain information from public authorities about
the identity of his or her biological parents (Socialstyrelsen 2014). However, according to Swedish law,
there is no legal requirement for parents to inform adopted children that they are adopted (SOU 2009).

	  
10

Prior to 1974, there was no parental leave to care for adopted children. In 1974, the modern Swedish
parental leave system was introduced; in this system, parents had the right to a total of 6 months of paid
parental leave that could be divided among the parents as preferred. The system gave equal rights to ownbirth children and adopted children (SOU 1978). It replaced the older “moderskapsersättning” system that
was introduced in 1955 and that gave mothers the right to 3 months of paid leave (SOU 1954).

	  
	  

7	  

caseworkers, the evidence from that period suggests that social authorities were not able
to systematically match babies to families based on family and child characteristics (see
Lindquist, Sol, and Van Praag 2015 for more details). However, we will examine this
issue in more detail later.

3. Empirical Strategy
Adoption studies have been widely used by economists in other contexts to
determine the relative roles of genes and environment in influencing economic behavior.
Much of this research has incorporated information on outcomes of adoptive parents but
not on the biological parents of adopted children; thus, it does not compare the relative
effects on adopted children of the behaviors or outcomes of biological and adoptive
parents.11 Recent studies using Swedish data have been able to make this comparison by
taking advantage of the availability of data on both biological and adoptive parents.
These include the seminal study of Björklund, Lindahl, and Plug (2006) who studied
educational attainment and earnings. Since then, the Swedish data have been used to
study voting (Cesarini, Johannesson, and Oskarsson, 2014), crime (Hjalmarsson and
Lindquist, 2013), entrepreneurship (Lindquist, Sol, and Van Praag, 2015), and health
(Lindahl et al. 2015). These studies have found evidence that both characteristics of
biological and adoptive parents are predictive of child outcomes.
Our primary specification uses data on adoptees to relate stock market
participation of an adoptee to the stock market participation of both his/her biological and
adoptive parents. We estimate the following equation:

where P, our main variable of interest, is an indicator of whether an individual has stocks
in their portfolio, i indexes the biological family, j indexes the adoptive family, m refers
to mother and f refers to father, and X refers to the set of control variables. Because asset
allocation may vary by age, these include year-of-birth dummies for both parents and
children, along with a dummy variable for the gender of the child. We estimate linear
probability models but have verified that the marginal effects are very similar when a
probit model is used.
A key assumption in our empirical strategy is that adoptees are randomly assigned
to adoptive families at birth. Under this assumption, the coefficients on stock market
participation of biological parents provide an estimate of the effect of pre-birth factors
and the coefficients on stock market participation of adoptive parents provide an estimate
of the effects of post-birth factors. We will test this assumption in a variety of ways;
while the assumption may not be strictly true in our data, we provide evidence that
suggests that violations of the assumption do not have meaningful effects on our
estimates.

4. Data
We begin with merged administrative data containing information on all Swedish
citizens born between 1950 and 1980, including information on educational attainment,
county of residence, basic demographic information, and detailed wealth data.12 To this
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
12

The register contains information on highest educational degree completed, which we use to impute years
of schooling. We follow Holmlund et al. (2011) and impute years of schooling in the following way: 7 for
(old) primary school, 9 for (new) compulsory schooling, 9.5 for (old) post-primary school (realskola), 11

	  

9	  

we merge the Swedish multigenerational register, which contains information on both
biological and adoptive parents for adopted children, and enables us to link children born
1980 or earlier to their parents.
For data on asset allocation, we predominantly rely on the Swedish Wealth Data
(Förmögenhetsregistret). These data were collected by the government’s statistical
agency, Statistics Sweden, for tax purposes between 1999 and 2007, at which point the
wealth tax was abolished.13 For the years 1999 to 2006, the data include all financial
assets held outside retirement accounts at the end of a tax year, December 31st, reported
by a variety of different sources, including the Swedish Tax Agency, welfare agencies,
and the private sector. Financial institutions provided information to the tax agency on
their customers’ security investments and dividends, interest paid or received, and
deposits, including nontaxable securities and securities owned by investors, even for
persons below the wealth tax threshold. Because the information is based on statements
from financial institutions, it is likely to have very little measurement error and, because
the entire population is observed, selection bias is not a problem.

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
for short high school, 12 for long high school, 14 for short university, 15.5 for long university, and 19 for a
PhD university education. Since the education register does not distinguish between junior-secondary
school (realskola) of different lengths (9 or 10 years), it is coded as 9.5 years. For similar reasons, long
university is coded as 15.5 years of schooling.
13

During this time period, the wealth tax was paid on all the assets of the household, including real estate
and financial securities, with the exception of private businesses and shares in small public businesses
(Calvet, Campbell, and Sodini 2007) and, in year 2000, was levied at a rate of 1.5 percent on net household
wealth exceeding SEK 900,000. The Swedish krona traded at $0.106 at the end of 2000, so this threshold
corresponds to $95,400. After 2000, the tax threshold was raised to SEK 1,500,000 for married couples and
non-married cohabitating couples with common children and 1,000,000 for single taxpayers. In 2002 the
threshold rose again, this time to SEK 2,000,000 for married couples and non-married cohabitating couples
and 1,500,000 for single taxpayers. In 2005 the threshold rose once more but this time only for married
couples and cohabitating couples, this time to SEK 3,000,000.

From this, we observe the aggregate value of bank accounts, mutual funds, stocks,
options, bonds, and capital endowment insurance as well as total financial assets and total
assets.14 We analyze equity market participation, and the extent of it, using outcome
variables constructed in year 2000, although we have tested the sensitivity of our
conclusions to this choice and have found them to be quite robust.15
Our primary measure of equity market participation is an indicator variable for
whether the individual owns stocks directly – we refer to this as stock market
participation or direct equity participation. However, we also study the share of financial
wealth that is invested in stocks – we refer to this as the stock share or risky share. As a
robustness check, we also report estimates using a broader measure of risk taking that
includes participation through either direct stock holding or mutual funds with a stock
component.16
We use data from the Income Register to measure income for our sample. The
register includes income beginning in 1968. Our measure of income includes earnings
from employed labor as well as self-employment income and taxable benefits. The
variable we use is the log of average (deflated) labor income between 1980 and 2000. In
the few cases where labor income is zero in all years, we set the log to zero.
Our sample includes children born in 1950 or later with all applicable parents

Small bank accounts were not reported by banks to the Swedish Tax Agency unless there was more than
100 SEK (about $10) in interest during the year. However, Statistics Sweden estimates that 98% of the total
money in bank accounts is included in the data.
15

We have run all the regressions with wealth data from 1999 and 2001 and the results are identical. We
also show later in the paper that the estimates are similar when we use data from 1999 for parents and 2006
for children.
16

This includes holdings of mutual funds that only include stocks but also includes mutual funds that have
a mixture of stocks and other financial instruments such as cash or bonds.

alive in 2000 and for whom we have information on schooling, earnings, and wealth.17
We have information on over two million children who are raised by their biological
parents and 3275 adopted children who have data available for both biological and
adoptive mothers and fathers.18
We report descriptive statistics for our sample in Table 1. The top panel has
means for children, both biological and adoptive. In 2000, when their assets and
education are measured, the average child age is 32.5 for biological children and 35 for
adoptive children. Biological children have half a year more education on average and
their probability of holding stocks is higher (26% to 23%). However, adopted children
have higher financial assets.
The second panel has means for biological parents, both parents who raised their
own biological children and parents who gave their children up for adoption. There are
large differences in the characteristics of these two types of biological parents with the
biological parents of adoptees having much less wealth and lower years of schooling.
Finally, the bottom panel has descriptive statistics for adoptive parents. For
adopted children, adoptive parents are older, wealthier, better educated, and more likely
to hold stocks and risky assets than the child’s biological parents. When compared to
biological parents who raise their own children, adoptive parents also seem positively
selected, but the differences here are much smaller.

Because of changing access to contraception and abortion in the later 1960s and early 1970s, there is
some concern that children born and adopted after 1970 could be different. However, as we show later,
results using only children born before 1970 are very similar.

18

We later test the sensitivity of our conclusions to the restriction that we observe both biological mothers
and fathers of adopted children and find the results to be quite consistent.

5. Results
Table 2a provides estimates of equation (1) for the sample of adopted children
with an indicator for stock market participation as the dependent variable.19 In column (1),
we include dummies for stock market participation of both biological and both adoptive
parents. All coefficients are statistically significant, but the coefficients on adoptive
parents are larger than those on biological parents, suggesting that pre-birth factors
(including genes) have a smaller influence on risk taking in financial markets than do
environmental factors.20
In column (1) of Table 2a, we included all parents and children irrespective of
whether they have positive financial wealth. However, individuals without financial
wealth cannot invest in stocks, so for those individuals without financial wealth, we may
not be observing their true risk preferences. As a result, we next consider what happens to
our estimates when we condition on having positive financial wealth—first of the parents
and then of the children.
In column (2) of Table 2a, we add indicator variables for whether each type of
parent has positive financial wealth (4 indicator variables in total). Now the coefficients
on risky asset holding reveal the effect of parental stock holding conditional on parents
having positive financial wealth. If the coefficients change substantially, this suggests
that the relationship we are observing may in fact be driven by the effect of parental
financial wealth (or other variables correlated with parental financial wealth) on the risktaking of children instead of the effect of parental risk taking itself. It is important to note
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
19

Because there can be multiple adoptive children in a family, we cluster the standard errors at the adoptive
family level.

20

If we exclude risk taking of mothers or of fathers, the coefficients increase somewhat when the risky
holdings of the other spouse is omitted, presumably because of assortative mating.	  

	  

13	  

that the coefficients remain positive and statistically significant (with the exception of
stock holding of biological fathers) but are a bit smaller than in column (1), suggesting
that very little of the relationship can be explained by positive parental financial wealth
holding.
Next, we condition on children having positive financial wealth; in this case, we
are considering the relationship between child and parent risk-taking conditional on them
both having positive financial wealth (and thus the opportunity to hold risky assets).
However, these results are quite speculative, as children’s positive financial wealth may
be endogenous to parent’s risk-taking behaviors (both biological and adoptive).21
In column (3) we estimate the stock-holding regression, conditioning on the
indicators for positive parental financial wealth and including only children who have
positive financial wealth. This reduces the sample size from 3275 to 1986. Interestingly,
the relative magnitude of the adoptive coefficients increases relative to the biological
coefficients. So, conditional on parents and children having positive financial wealth,
there is less evidence that the risk-taking of biological parents affects child behavior,
suggesting a limited role for factors such as innate risk preferences or ability.
The relationship between portfolio choices of parents and their adoptive children
could reflect a direct causal effect of parental stock-holding or environmental
transmission of risk preferences. However, it is also possible that parental stock-holding
is proxying for other omitted parental characteristics such as parental wealth, income, or
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
21

In Appendix Table 1 we examine whether the child has positive financial wealth as a function of parental
characteristics. In Column 1, we see that there is a clear positive relationship between stock-holding of all
four types of parents and the child having positive financial wealth. When we control for whether parents
have positive financial wealth (Column 2), we still find positive effects but they are smaller, particularly for
biological parents. We have also verified that, if we control for the level of parental financial wealth, the
biological risk-taking coefficients become very small and statistically insignificant. Columns 3 and 4
present comparable results for the children raised by their biological parents for comparison.

education, and it is these characteristics that directly affect the behavior of the child. To
test this possibility, we control for all these characteristics of the adoptive and biological
parents and see whether coefficient on parents’ stock-holding declines. These estimates
are in Column (4) of Table 2a. Comparing the estimates to those in column (3), we see
that the addition of parental characteristics reduces the coefficients but not by a lot.
One other possibility is that transmission of risk preferences occurs because
parents with risky portfolios are wealthier and invest more in their children’s human
capital.22 To assess this possible mechanism, we add a control for child education. We
also add controls for child earnings and child wealth to see whether these reflect plausible
mechanisms. The estimates (in column (5) of Table 2a) are almost identical to those in
column (4). While this type of analysis can only be suggestive due to the endogeneity of
the child characteristics, it suggests that these may not be important intermediate
variables in the intergenerational transmission of stock-holding.23
An alternative measure of risk-taking is the stock share -- the proportion of
financial wealth invested in stocks. We study the intergenerational relationships in this
variable in columns (6) and (7). In column (6), we restrict the sample to children with
positive financial wealth and, in column (7), we further restrict to children who hold
some stocks. Analogously, the controls in column (6) include indicators for whether
parents have positive financial wealth and those in column (7) include indicators for
whether parents hold stocks. In both columns, we find that the intergenerational
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  

22	  In

earlier work, we used exogenous variation in education due to compulsory schooling laws to show that
there is a positive effect of educational attainment on risky market participation of men (Black et al. 2015).
	  
23
Unlike Charles and Hurst (2003) who find the intergenerational correlation in stock ownership can be
explained away once parent and child incomes are controlled for, we do not find such an effect. An
advantage of this study compared to Charles and Hurst (2003) is that we have earnings data for a longer
period of time. 	  

	  

15	  

relationships are only evident for adoptive parents. The effects are quite large – an
increase in the stock share of 0.1 for an adoptive mother (father) increases the stock share
of the adoptive child by 0.03 (0.02).
How can we interpret these results? In a standard asset-pricing model (assuming
constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) and independently and identically distributed
returns), the risk preference parameter for an individual is proportional to the share that
the individual invests in equities. So, our finding that intergenerational correlations in the
stock shares are only evident for adoptive parents suggests that risk attitudes may be
environmentally rather than genetically determined.
Table 2b has analogous results for own-birth children for comparison. As has
been documented in the literature, the magnitudes of the intergenerational correlations are
quite substantial. About 26% of own-birth children invest in stocks. The effects for ownbirth children imply that having a father who invests in these assets increases child
participation by .14 or about 54% of the mean. The equivalent figure for mothers is even
larger at 73%. Consistent with other papers using different outcome variables, we find
that the effect of parent asset allocation on that of own birth children is approximately
equal to the sum of the biological and adoptive effects for adoptive children. For example,
comparing column (1) of Table 2a to column (1) of Table 2b, the sum of the coefficients
is .42 in the former and .34 in the latter. This finding suggests that the total overall
intergenerational transmission through nature and nurture may be largely unaffected by
the adoption itself.

	  

16	  

Household Level Analysis
In the analysis so far, we have studied mother and father stock-holding separately.
However, it is plausible that adoptive parents make joint decisions about their portfolio
allocation. Therefore, in Table 3, we report estimates where we combine mothers and
fathers. For stock holding, the variable now becomes 1 if either parent holds stocks and
zero otherwise; for the stock share, the variable becomes the proportion of the total
financial wealth of the mother and father that is invested in stocks. At this aggregate level,
the findings very clearly show that environmental factors are more important than
biological and, once there are controls for parents and children having positive financial
wealth, there is no evidence that nature matters but strong evidence of large nurture
effects.

Gender Differences
There are a number of reasons we might expect the relationship between parents’
and child’s risky financial behavior to vary by gender. First, it is well documented that
attitudes towards risk differ between men and women.24 Also, it is plausible that children
are influenced by their adoptive parents' risk attitudes as a result of information sharing
or role modeling, and that these effects differ systematically by gender – for example,
children may be more influenced by the adoptive parent of the same sex. Therefore, in
Tables 4a and 4b, we split the sample by child gender. The coefficient estimates suggest
girls are more influenced by their adoptive mother and boys by their adoptive father
(although the differences are only statistically significant for girls). While this evidence is
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
	  See, Eckel and Grossman	  (2008) for a survey of the literature.

17	  

only speculative, it does suggest that role-model effects may be part of the explanation
for the patterns we observe.

Interaction between Nature and Nurture
We have thus far assumed that the effects of biological and adoptive parents are
independent of each other. However, this may be an oversimplification if the genetic
component interacts with the environmental component, one building on the other.25 We
present the results when we allow for an interaction between biological and adoptive
parents in Table 5. In each column, we allow an interaction between the effects of
biological and adoptive mothers and an equivalent interaction for fathers. In most of the
specifications, the interaction terms are small and statistically insignificant, suggesting
that those with genetic factors "suitable" for risky market participation do not necessarily
benefit more from an environment in which a parent invests in risky markets.

An Alternative Measure of Risky Assets
In Table 6, we report estimates where we use a broader definition of risky asset
holding that includes mutual funds with a stock component in addition to stock holdings.
Note that the included mutual funds may also include less risky assets such as bonds and
cash. The results are qualitatively similar to those for stock-holding. Risky-holding of
adoptive parents is more predictive of risky-holding of children than is risky-holding of
biological parents. Again, it is notable that, once one controls for parents and children
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
25

There are mixed findings in the literature about these types of interactions – Bjorklund, Lindahl, and Plug
(2006) finds evidence of these interactions for mothers' education and fathers' earnings but Lindquist, Sol,
van Praag (2015) finds no evidence for these interactions when studying entrepreneurship.

	  

18	  

having positive financial wealth, there is no evidence for any biological effects. When we
look at the risky share, there is also no evidence that child behavior is related to that of
their biological parents. So, the conclusions using this broader measure are very similar
to those for stock-holding.

6. Tests of Model Assumptions and Specification Checks
Our interpretation of the coefficients above as reflecting the nature versus nurture
components of financial risk-taking requires a number of assumptions. One of these is
that adoptions occur soon after birth—if this were not the case, the coefficient on
biological parents might reflect both nature and nurture, and our estimates would be
biased in favor of the nature component. Because we do not observe the timing of the
adoption in our data, we cannot test this directly; however, we do know that about 80% of
adoptions occur within the first year after birth, so there is limited post-birth experience
of the biological parents for most adoptees in our sample (Björklund, Lindahl, and Plug
2006).
The other important assumption is that adoptees are randomly assigned to
adoptive families and we address this next. For parsimony, we only report robustness
checks for the specification in column (1) of Tables 2-5. Estimates from the other
specifications are similarly robust.

Random Assignment of Adoptees
As noted earlier, adoptees may not be randomly assigned to parents, so the
question then becomes how this non-random assignment might be affecting our estimates.
	  

19	  

The primary concern is that coefficient estimates may be biased due to correlations
between risk holdings of adoptive (biological) parents and unobserved characteristics of
the biological (adoptive) parents that are correlated with child risk holding. While earlier
work using similar strategies with Swedish data has demonstrated that this non-random
assignment is unlikely to be a problem, we conduct a number of robustness checks to
verify this.
If there are correlations between risk holdings of adoptive parents and unobserved
characteristics of the biological parents that are correlated with child risk holding, one
might expect the coefficients on risk holding of adoptive parents to vary depending on
whether risk holding of biological parents is included in the regression. The results when
we do this are presented in Table 7. Column (1) of Table 7 shows estimates with just the
stock holding variables for the adoptive parents included. In column (2), we add stock
holding variables for the biological parents, which is the specification previously reported
in column (1) of Table 2a. As we can see in column (2), these coefficients on adoptive
parents’ stock holding change very little when we include biological parents stock
holding behavior, suggesting that the two variables are not highly correlated. As another
check for omitted variable bias, we next include a number of other controls for
characteristics of the biological parents. Again, if it were the case that the results were
driven by selection of adopted parents, then adding further controls for biological parents’
characteristics should reduce our coefficients on adoptive parents’ stock holding. Column
(3) of Table 7 includes risk holdings of adoptive parents and adds controls for schooling,
earnings, and wealth of biological parents as proxies for general unobserved
characteristics of biological parents. Comparing the coefficients on adoptive parent risk
	  

20	  

holding in column (3) to column (1), the difference is very small. Finally, in column (4),
we include both biological risk-taking and the other characteristics of biological parents.
The resulting estimates are almost identical to those in column (3). Overall, it appears
that our adoptive estimates are unlikely to be significantly biased by non-random
assignment.
Columns (5) to (8) of Table 7 carry out the analogous exercise for stock holding
for biological parents. In column (5), we only include the stock holding variables for the
biological parents and then, in column (6) we add the stock holding behavior of the
adoptive parents. Column (7) adds controls for education, income, and wealth of adoptive
parents, and column (8) includes both stock holding behavior for adoptive parents as well
as their education, income, and wealth. While the coefficients on stock holding of
biological parents decrease somewhat in columns (6)-(8) compared to column (5), the
differences are not very large. This suggests that non-random assignment of adoptees is
unlikely to be a problem and, if anything, will lead to an overstatement of the role of
biological parents relative to that of adoptive parents.

Varying When Stock-Holding is Measured
There are a number of reasons why one might be concerned about the concurrent
measuring of stock holding for parents—both biological and adoptive—and children.
The first is that there might be reverse causation-- children are influencing their parents’
behavior, and not the other way around. While it seems safe to assume that our estimates
of biological effects do not suffer from reverse causation since there is likely little contact
between biological parents and their children, it is possible that the environmental effects
	  

21	  

could partially reflect the influence of adopted children on their adoptive parents. For
example, a risk-loving child could persuade his/her parents to invest in more risky assets.
While it is impossible to rule out this mechanism, we can redo the estimation using
parental risk-taking in 1999 and child risk-taking in 2006. Because we measure the
variables for parents 7 years before the equivalent variables for children, reverse causality
is less of an issue than when we measure them contemporaneously.26
Table 8 presents these results. As can be seen by comparing Column (1)--our
baseline specification using data from 2000 from our earlier specification—to Column
(2)—the same specification using data from 1999/2006, estimates are similar to our
baseline.27
Another potential issue is that biological parents are on average 9 years younger
than the adoptive parents in 2000. Given that there may be life-cycle patterns in stock
holding behavior, our conclusions may be sensitive to this difference.28 To address this,
we can measure the stock-holding of adoptive parents in 1999 and biological parents in
2006, thus largely eliminating the age gap at measurement. Columns (3) and (4) of Table
8 report these estimates for child stock-holding measured in 2000 and 2006, respectively.
We find that the estimates are quite similar in both cases.

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
26

Taking this approach also increases the age we observe children’s stock holding by 6 years and so allows
us to see whether our results are sensitive to child age. Later, in Appendix Table 2, we do a robustness
check where we leave out the youngest cohorts.

	  
27

Furthermore, we have examined whether changes in stock market participation between 1999 and 2006
are correlated for parents and children and found only a tiny relationship. This suggests that parental
preferences for risk-taking are unlikely to be influenced by their children’s preferences.
28

Using Norwegian data, Fagereng, Gottlieb, and Guiso (2013) document life cycle patterns in stock
market participation and portfolio allocation.

	  
	  

22	  

Further Robustness Checks
While we have attributed the relationship between adoptive parents’ behavior and
children’s decisions to parental behavior and environment, it may be that both parents
and children are subject to common influences such as both living in an area in which
there is high stock market participation. To examine this, in Column (2) of Appendix
Table 2 we add controls for county of residence of both parents and children in 2000.29
Conclusions are robust to this specification check.
Thus far, we have also assumed that the relationships we are estimating are
constant across cohorts. However, this may not be the case; the introduction of
contraception (the Pill) as well as the legalization of abortion occurred in the late 1960s
and early 1970s in Sweden; as a result, the characteristics of children being put up for
adoption may have changed over this time period. To investigate this, we estimate our
basic specification using the subset of cohorts born by 1970; these results are presented in
column (3) of Appendix Table 2. The results are quite robust to the choice of cohorts.
Note that, by restricting to cohorts born by 1970, we are also excluding children younger
than 30 from our sample. Therefore, this check also provides reassurance that our
estimates are not being heavily influenced by children who are too young to have made
investment decisions.

7. External Validity
Finally, while our estimates may distinguish between nature and nurture effects
among adopted children, there remains the question of whether they identify the relative
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
	  Sweden is divided into 20 regional county councils. Their main responsibilities are to provide and

29

23	  

importance of nature and nurture more generally. Threats to external validity could arise
if the adopted children are not representative of children in general or the adoptive and
biological parents are not representative of the population of parents. In this section, we
examine some of these issues.

Missing Fathers
As described above, we are missing information on a substantial number of
biological parents because the identity of the father was not ascertained at the time of the
adoption. To assess whether our results are sensitive to this missing information, we have
rerun the main specification using all biological mothers for whom we have information,
regardless of whether the information for the biological father is present. The results are
presented in columns (4) and (5) of Appendix Table 2. Column (4) presents the results on
our main sample when we include only mother characteristics, and Column (5) presents
the results for the larger sample, including those with missing fathers. Comparing these
estimates, we see that the estimates are quite insensitive to the sample used, suggesting
our results may generalize to the population of adoptees more generally. In column (6)
we add risk-taking of the adoptive father and we see that the coefficient on this variable is
also very similar to that in the baseline specification.

Reweighting for Generalizability
As is clear from Table 1, adoptive parents are somewhat positively selected in
terms of observables and so may not be representative of parents in general. In addition,
biological parents who give their children up for adoption are somewhat negatively
	  

24	  

selected in terms of observables. To attempt to address these issues, we reweight each
observation in the non-adoptees sample to make the comparison families more similar to
our sample of adopted children. Because the adopted children are different along two
dimensions—their biological parents are negatively selected and their adoptive parents
are positively selected—we do the reweighting twice, first to make the non-adoptive
parents similar to the adoptive parents and then to make the non-adoptive parents similar
to the biological parents of adopted children. When we do so (see Appendix Table 3), we
find that the results are quite consistent to those presented earlier, suggesting our results
may be generalizable beyond the sample of adoptees.30
In addition to the observed differences, there may be unobserved differences
between adoptive and other parents. Adoptive parents might invest less or more in their
adopted children than other parents. The former could occur if adoptive parents don’t
treat their children as well as they would if they were biological children; the latter could
occur if adoptive parents are “better” parents than average -- adoptive parents must, for
instance, be approved before being able to adopt. By definition, we are limited in how
much we can assess the unobserved differences between adoptive and other parents. We
have, however, verified that the effect of parental risk-taking on biological children in the
small number of families with both adoptive and biological children is not statistically
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
30	  To calculate weights in the first case, we use a logit model to estimate the probability that a particular
parent pair have adopted children using parental characteristics such as birth year, schooling, total assets,
indicators for holding risky assets, and earnings. Using the estimated coefficients, we form the propensity
!
, where p is the estimated propensity
score and use this to weight the sample of own-birth children by
!!!

score. This re-weighting makes the own-birth families similar in observables to the adoptive ones. When
we do a weighted regression on the own-birth children, we find coefficients that remain very similar to the
un-weighted ones. This is shown in columns (1) and (2) of Appendix Table 3. We take a similar approach
here for reweighting the own-child sample to make it similar to the sample of biological parents of adopted
children. These estimates are in column (3) of Appendix Table 3. Here the reweighting reduces the
estimates slightly for biological mothers and fathers.

	  
	  

25	  

different to that of parental risk-taking on biological children in general. This suggests
that there may not be systematic differences in parenting behaviors between biological
and adoptive parents.31

8. Conclusion
A large literature has documented the correlation between parental and child risktaking along a variety of dimensions—risky portfolio allocations, risk-taking preferences,
and even risky behaviors such as smoking and drinking (Charles and Hurst 2003,
Schmidt and Tauchmann 2011, Dohmen et al. 2012, Vandewater et al. 2014). However,
researchers have puzzled over whether these similarities are innate, and thus biologically
determined, and how much they are influenced by environmental factors. This paper is
able to address this issue using unique data on adoptees in Sweden.
Our main finding is that environmental factors are particularly important in
determining the intergenerational transmission of stock market participation. At a
minimum, 2/3 of the correlation we observe appears to be driven by environmental
factors and only 1/3 can be attributed to biological factors. Once one conditions on
positive financial wealth of parents and children and examines the relationship between
the shares of assets held in stocks across generations, biological factors become largely
insignificant. This is very different from conclusions drawn from twin studies suggesting
that environmental factors have very little impact on sibling correlations in risky market
participation. While there are many differences between the twin approach and our
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
31

A proportion of adoptive parents subsequently split up and, thus, the adoptive father may have limited
influence on the child. Of our sample of 3275 adoptive children with parents alive in 2000, 2856 have
adoptive parents who are still together in 2000. When we allow the effects of parents to differ depending on
whether the adoptive parents are still together in 2000, we find no evidence that the effects differ between
the two groups.

	  

26	  

approach using adoptees, the divergence is surprising given that shared twin
environmental factors should include many of the family influences that we consider
likely to be responsible for the nurture effects we find.32 One possible rationale is that
assumptions of the twin approach are violated because identical twins are more likely to
communicate and share information than other twins -- Calvet and Sodini (2014) find that
communication has a strong influence on the ascribed genetic component of the effect.
Our investigation of the source of environmental effects suggests that controlling
for the education, earnings, and wealth of adoptive parents and even of the children has
little impact on the intergenerational stock market participation coefficient. This suggests
that the results we observe are not likely just a reflection of some omitted variable related
to wealth or income. Given our quest to understand where preferences come from, this
research certainly leaves some questions as to whether risk preferences are truly innate,
and suggests that, at a minimum, there is a significant role for environment influences.

Interestingly, a similar dichotomy is found for entrepreneurship with twin findings suggesting little role
for environmental factors but the adoption approach finding environmental factors to be more important
than biological ones (Lindquist, Sol, and van Praag 2015).
