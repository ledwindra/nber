The Measure of Man and Older Age Mortality:
Evidence from the Gould Sample

ABSTRACT
This paper documents differences in body size between white, black, and Indian mid-nineteenth
century American men and investigates the socioeconomic and demographic determinants of frame size
using a unique data set of Civil War soldiers. It finds that over time men have grown taller and heavier
and have relatively less abdominal fat. Abdominal fat in young adulthood was an excellent predictor of
older age mortality from ischemic heart disease or stroke. Changes in frame size explain roughly
three-fifths of the mortality decline among white men between 1915 and 1988 and predict even sharper
declines in older age mortality between 1988 and 2022.

Introduction

Human physiology has changed dramatically over the last 300 years. Body size increased by
over 50 percent and average longevity increased by more than 100 percent (Fogel and Costa
1997). Chronic disease rates at older ages decreased by almost 50 percent and rates of functional
limitations by over 60 percent (Costa 2000; Costa 2002). These changes have been possible
because humans have learned to control their environment. Rising wealth and advances in
agriculture have improved nutritional status. Knowledge of the germ theory of disease spurred
sanitary reforms that reduced infectious disease rates. Medical innovations now allow both for
short-term symptom relief and for long-term control of chronic conditions.
This paper provides new evidence on changes in human physiology and their implications for older age mortality. Our evidence to date comes from extensive data on stature and
relatively sparse data on weight. But, there is more to the human frame than height and weight. Fat
patterning, lung capacity, and muscle strength are independent, and sometimes better, predictors
of later work levels, disease, and death.
The paper documents the body size of mid-nineteenth century American men, white,
black, and Indian, using a unique data set of Union Army Civil War soldiers, collected by the
United States Sanitary Commission and first analyzed by Benjamin Gould (Gould 1866). It
examines the predictors of body size and investigates the relationship between body size and
mortality from heart disease at older ages. The findings have implications for understanding the
causes underlying declines in mortality and morbidity, for assessing the living standards of past
populations, and for predicting future mortality rates.

The Human Frame

The environment shapes the human frame; it determines its height, weight, fat patterning, lung
capacity, and muscular strength. Poor net nutritional status during the growing years (including
the fetal stage) leads to a shorter population and poor current net nutritional status to a lighter
population. Poor nutritional status arises not just from insufficient nutritional intake, but also
from the demands of disease, work, and climate. In present day England shorter populations are
found in counties that had higher infant mortality rates from respiratory diseases at the beginning
of the century (Barker 1992). Low birth weight for gestational age babies not only grow up to
be shorter (Paz et al. 1993; Lagerström et al. 1994), but they may also grow up to have greater
abdominal fat deposits. Barker (1992) finds that adult waist-hip ratio falls with increasing birth
weight and weight at one year of age, but did not control for gestational age. Loos et al. (2001)
find that among twins the heavier twin at birth was not only taller and heavier as an adult, but,
when adjusted for body mass, he had a lower waist-hip ratio, less subcutaneous fat, and more lean
body mass compared to his lighter sibling. Birth weight and early life infections predict adult
lung capacity. Barker (1992) finds that among adults forced expiratory volume in one second
fell with decreasing birth weight even controlling for health in infancy and later socioeconomic
factors, but that vital capacity and birth weight were not related. However, infections in early
infancy were related both to forced expiratory volume and to forced vital capacity. In present day
Guatemala babies weighing less than 2500 grams at birth not only grow up smaller, but also with
less muscle strength (Martorell et al. 1996).
In the United States of the nineteenth century, infectious disease played a large role
in determining stature. White men living in the major cities and in other high mortality areas
were shorter than those from remote rural areas. Although there were differences in height
by occupation, these were small compared to the several centimeter occupational differences in

2

stature among Europeans and to urban-rural differentials that were up to 3 cm in the United States
(Costa and Steckel 1997; Floud et al. 1990; Haines et al. 2000). An abundant food supply ensured
that the poor in the United States were relatively well-fed, even in the womb. Their birth weights
were high in Philadelphia by mid-twentieth century standards (Goldin and Margo 1989) and in
Montreal by present day standards (Ward 1993). In contrast, European birth weights were much
lower, averaging only slightly more than 3200 gm (Ward 1993).
The slave population of the United States experienced an unusual pattern of growth.
Because pregnant women were over-worked and children were poorly fed, slave children at birth
probably weighed an average of 2500 gm and by four and half years of age were only at the
0.2 height centile, below the level of the poorest populations of developing countries. When
slaves reached field hand age large quantities of meat were introduced into their diets and slaves
experienced such remarkable catch-up growth that by adulthood they were only slightly shorter
than northern, white men and were taller than most European populations (Steckel 1989). They
were also heavier than northern whites (Fogel 1992).
Anthropological and bioarcheological evidence suggests that prior to extensive contact
with whites, native Americans had a high standard of health. The Plains Indians enjoyed a rich
and varied diet, equally distributed, and a low disease burden. They were the tallest recorded
mid-nineteenth century population (Prince and Steckel 2001).
The implications of body size for mortality and morbidity have been studied extensively
in recent populations, but relatively little in past populations. Costa (1993) finds that the functional
relation between height and subsequent mortality is similiar among a sample of 322 Union Army
recruits measured at ages 23-49 who lived to age 55 and are observed over a twenty year period
and among modern, Norwegian males aged 40-59 observed over a seven year period.1 Both

the Norwegian curve and the U.S. curve show that mortality first declines with height to reach
a minimum at heights close to 185cm and then starts to rise. A similar relationship is found
between height and self-reported health status (Fogel 1997). The relationship between height and
subsequent mortality is very sensitive to sample size and does not always hold up in all samples
(e.g. Costa forthcoming). Height appears to be inversely related to heart and respiratory diseases
and positively related to the hormonal cancers (Barker 1992).
The body mass index (BMI), defined as weight in kilograms divided by the square
of height in meters, is an even stronger predictor of mortality and morbidity than height. The
relation between weight and mortality among Union Army veterans measured at ages 50-64 and
observed from age 50 until 75 resembles that seen among modern, Norwegian males (Costa
1993). Mortality risk first declines rapidly at low weights as BMI increases, stays relatively flat
over BMI levels from the low to high twenties, then starts to rise again, but less steeply than at
very low BMIs. Among modern, American males aged 50-64 the relationship between BMI and
self-reported health status, the number of bed days, the number of doctors’ visits, and the number
of hospitalizations follows a similar U-shaped pattern (Costa 1996).
Studies of recent populations suggest that measures of central or abdominal body fat
are better markers than BMI of risk of death, especially risk of fatal coronary heart disease (e.g.
Folsom et al. 1993). Abdominal fat distribution is associated with antecedents of cardiovascular
disease such as hypertension, non-insulin dependent diabetes, high plasma concentrations of
atherogenic lipids, and low concentrations of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (Ohlson et al.
1985; Blair et al. 1984; Folsom et al. 1989).2 One very common measure of abdominal fat is
the waist-hip ratio, but there is also evidence that the ratio of chest circumference to biacromial

2

Atherogenic lipids such as chylomicrons, very low density lipoproteins, and low density lipoproteins accelerate
the deposition of lipids in the intima of the arteries. This deposition of lipids is associated with atherosclerosis. High
levels of high density lipoproteins may protect against risk of atherosclerosis, perhaps because these lipoproteins
may be scavengers for excess cholesterol present in arterial walls.

(shoulder) diameter and of chest circumference to standing height are significantly and directly
associated with coronary heart disease (Yao et al. 1991). There is still little agreement on the
exact relationship between measures of abdominal fat and mortality risk. Among men, a waisthip ratio above 0.95 or above 1 is generally considered high risk. However, in a young age
group, particularly one in the military, it is rare to find men with waist-hip ratios above one. A
23-year follow-up study of WWII soldiers measured prior to discharge in 1946-47 shows that
a standard deviation increase in waist-hip ratio above the mean increased mortality risk from
ischaemic and cerebrovascular heart disease by up to 1.24 times and that this relationship was
linear (Terry et al. 1992). Yao et al. (1991) find that measures of central body fat are linearly
related to cardiovascular disease mortality, but, like BMI, they have a U-shaped relation with all
cause mortality. However, Schreiner et al. (1996) argue that when waist circumference is used
as a surrogate for intra-abdominal fat area in men, a quadratic term should be included in the
analysis as a predictor variable.
In the United States today, blacks have smaller waist circumferences than whites at the
same levels of BMI (Okoson et al. 2000). Among men (but not women) no racial differences in
the relationship between central obesity and disease have been detected (Freedman et al. 1995).
The last two health indicators considered in this research are lifting capacity and lung
capacity. In a world where many labored in manual jobs, lifting capacity determined work levels
and productivity. Studies of recent populations have found that lung capacity is associated with
respiratory tract illnesses and chronic respiratory symptoms (Martinez, Taussig, and Morgan
1990; Eisen et al 1987) and with mortality from respiratory diseases, lung cancer, and stroke
(Strachan 1991; Loomis, Collman, and Kogan 1989).
Whether anthropometric measures have direct pathogenic effects or are simply markers
of other processes remains unclear. Consider the case of a high waist-hip ratio. Sustained
adrenal overactivity, initiated by early growth restraint, may increase abdominal fat depositions

5

and separately lead to hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance. Alternatively, the distinctive
biochemical characteristics of intra-abdominal fat may perturb lipid and carbohydrate metabolism
thus leading to cardiovascular disease and diabetes (Barker 1992).

Data

In the early part of 1863 the United States Sanitary Commission began its inquiry into the physical
and social condition of soldiers. By the end of the war it had collected data on 23,785 men,
consisting of 16,900 white Union soldiers, 1146 white Union sailors, 68 white Union marines,
2883 black Union soldiers (recruited both in the North and in the South), 1980 Confederate
prisoners of war, 517 Indians (mainly Iroquois from upstate New York), and 291 students.
Trained examiners armed with andrometers, spirometers, dynamometers, facial angle instruments,
platform balances, calipers, and measuring tape measured men’s body dimensions, weight, lifting
strength, and vital capacity, and obtained basic demographic and socio-economic information.
The original forms filled in by the examiners are available in the New York Public Library. With
the exception of the student records, all available records were put into machine readable form,
yielding a sample of 20,213 men of which 2591 are black, 339 are Indians, 1417 are Confederate
prisoners of war, and the remainder are white Union soldiers and sailors. A subsample of 521
white Union soldiers who survived to 1900 were linked to their pension records, providing
mortality information.
The Sanitary Commission collected the sample (henceforth referred to as the Gould
sample) by sending sixteen examiners to specific locations, including Washington, where the
armies of the Potomac and the West were concentrated. Compared to the Union Army as a whole,
the location of the examiners increases the proportion of recruits who were born in the Middle
Atlantic (especially New York City) relative to the Union Army. Therefore, the average recruit

6

was shorter and the proportion of recruits who were farmers was smaller than in the Union Army
(see the Data Appendix for details). The average recruit in the Gould sample was also more likely
to be native-born. Because the Union Army was representative of the northern population in
terms of geographic distribution, foreign birth, and household wealth (Fogel 1993), the men in the
Gould sample are therefore more urban, native-born, and shorter than the population as a whole.
Work with previous samples of Union Army veterans indicates that no biases are introduced in
linkage to the pension records (Fogel 1993).
The paper focuses on 7 anthropometric indicators: height (an indicator of frame size),
BMI (a measure of total body fat), waist-hip ratio, the ratio of chest circumference to shoulder
breadth, the ratio of chest circumference to height (all indicators of central body fat), lifting
strength (an indicator of muscle strength), and vital capacity (a measure of lung capacity). The
quality of these measurements is discussed in the Data Appendix, which also provides details
about the other anthropometric variables available in the sample. Vital capacity is not comparable
to modern measures, but can still be compared across different groups within the Gould sample.
Socio-economic and demographic controls are race, birth place (classified as U.S., Ireland,
Germany, Great Britain, Canada, and other foreign), a dummy indicating if the native-born
were born in a city with a population of 50,000 or more in 1860, occupation (classified as
agricultural, professional or proprietor, artisan, and laborer), whether the recruits’ parents were
native-born, education (classified as none, limited common school, good common school, high
school, collegiate, and professional), whether the recruit was a seaman, and year of enlistment.
Linkage to the pension records provides information on year and cause of death. The
pension sample is further restricted to the 51 percent of men whose pension records provide
information on cause of death. For the most part, these were men with a surviving spouse and
men who lived longer. If the men in this sample are on whole healthier, then I am likely to
underestimate the impact of anthropometric measures on older age mortality. Causes of death are

7

coded as death from ischemic or cerebrovascular heart disease and death from other causes.3
Height and body fat measures in the Gould sample are compared with those of the
post World War II military from two anthropometric surveys used for designing uniforms and
equipment for military personnel. These are the 1950 Survey of Flying Personnel conducted
by the Air Force and the 1988 Anthropometric Survey of the U.S. Army. The latter survey
includes blacks. The two surveys provide data on height, BMI, waist-hip ratio, the ratio of chest
circumference to shoulder breadth, and of chest circumference to height. The measurements in
these surveys are comparable to those in the Gould sample (see the Data Appendix for further
details).

Trends

Table 1 shows that, with the exception of height and lifting capacity, reweighting the white Gould
sample so it is geographically representative of the white Union Army has very little effect on the
means of anthropometric measures. The analysis will therefore focus on the unweighted sample.
Table 1 shows that there were substantial differences in anthropometric characteristics
across races. Indians were the tallest, the heaviest, had the highest waist-hip and chest-shoulder
ratios, and had the greatest lifting strength and vital capacity. At ages 31-35 they were two cm
taller than all whites and one cm taller than native-born whites in the unweighted Gould sample.
However, differences between whites and Indians in height and vital capacity in the youngest
age groups were small, suggesting that by the 1840s, Indians in New York State had experienced
a relative deterioration in health. Note also that vital capacity does not decline after age 25, as
would be expected, suggesting that older cohorts of Indians were in better health than younger

The 1946-1947 data are from published tabulations in Terry et al. (1992). The 1950 data are from the 1950

cohorts. At younger ages (when they were still growing), blacks were the shortest, but by older
ages almost achieved the heights of whites. Blacks’ vital capacity was lower at all ages (and does
not decline with age), but their other anthropometric measures were comparable.
Over a span of one hundred years, men in the military have become taller and heavier,
but their waist-hip ratios and chest-shoulder ratios have not increased (see Table 2). The heights
of white Americans age 26-30 rose from 171 to 177 cm in 1988. The BMIs of white soldiers in
the oldest age group rose from 23 to 26. Note that the increase in BMI is more pronounced at
older ages, a phenomenon previously noted in Costa and Steckel (1997) and attributable to the

accumulated effects of work intensity and of working conditions, high rates of chronic disease at
older ages, and the accumulated effects of differences in nutritional intakes and physical activity.
Although the BMIs of men circa 1950 were greater than those of Civil War soldiers, the waist-hip
and chest-shoulder ratios of Civil War soldiers were greater. Controlling for BMI, both waist-hip
and chest-shoulder ratios were significantly greater in the Gould sample than in either the 1950
or 1988 military (see Table 3). Chest-height ratio, however, was smaller in the Gould sample.
Tables 1 and 2 also show that whereas in the Gould sample blacks and whites are similar
in terms of central body fat, in 1988 measures of central body fat were lower in blacks even when
their BMIs were greater. Controlling for BMI and age with ordinary least squares regressions
shows that all measures of central body fat are statistically significantly smaller in blacks than
in whites. The difference in ratios was 0.02 for waist-hip, 0.07 for chest-shoulder, and 0.01 for
chest-height. The absence of a difference between blacks and whites in measures of central body
fat in the Gould sample may therefore be an indicator of the greater environmental stress faced
by blacks in the mid-nineteenth century.
Anthropometric measures in the Gould sample are not highly correlated (see Table 4).

Correlations are for men of all races age 16-35 and exclude those in low vigor.

The measure of abdominal fat that is most strongly correlated with BMI is chest-height ratio. The
correlation between BMI and waist-hip ratio is low. Correlations, particularly those between BMI
and abdominal fat measures, are much stronger in the modern army (see Table 5). This pattern
would be expected if excessive nutritional intake determines waist-hip ratio today but if poor net
nutritional intake determined waist-hip ratio in the past.

Anthropometric Measures: Correlates

Examining the correlates of anthropometric measures in the Gould sample, particularly race,
foreign birth, size of city of birth, parents’ foreign birth, occupation, and education provides
information on how different groups fared controlling for observable demographic and socioeconomic factors and on the links between adverse conditions and outcomes.

where the first regression is for all races and nativities and the second regression is restricted
to native-born whites. The dependent variable yi is either height, BMI, waist-hip ratio, chestshoulder ratio, chest-height ratio, lifting strength, or vital capacity. The independent variables
include a vector of anthropometric controls (A). These are BMI in the case of the abdominal fat
measures, height and BMI in the case of lifting strength, and height in the case of vital capacity.
Additional controls include sets of dummies for race (R), nativity (N ), occupation (O), and
parents’ birth place (P ), a dummy equal to one if the man was born in a city with a population
of 50,000 in 1850 (C ), dummies for education (E ), a dummy variable equal to one if the man
was in low vigor (V ), a dummy variable equal to one if the man was a seaman (S ), and a set of
miscellaneous controls (M ) comprising age dummies, year of enlistment dummies, and dummies
indicating missing or inapplicable information for place of birth, occupation, education, and year
of enlistment. Robust standard errors, clustering on the 16 examiners, are given.
Tables 6, 7, and 8 confirm that differences in anthropometric characteristics across races
13

were substantial. Indians were the tallest and had a greater BMI than whites. Blacks were the
shortest and had the highest BMI. Note that because of their relatively small stature a higher BMI
would lower their mortality risk and therefore may explain why the mortality rates of blacks and
whites were not significantly different from each other above age 15 (Fogel 1992).4 Compared
to whites, blacks had significantly lower lifting strength and vital capacity. The anthropometric
characteristics of blacks who enlisted in free, northern states and those who enlisted in the south
were similar. Central body fat did not differ between blacks and whites, but recall that in recent
data blacks’ measures of central body fat are significantly lower. Central body fat was greater
among Indians than among whites, though this could reflect racial differences in body morphology.
Tables 6, 7, and 8 show that there were also substantial differences by nativity and
occupation. The foreign-born (with the exception of Canadians) were shorter than the nativeborn. Only Germans made up for their short heights with a greater BMI. The waist-hip ratios of
the foreign-born were greater than those of the native-born and their lifting strength was smaller.
Men working in agriculture were taller, heavier, had less abdominal fat, and had more lifting
strength than men in non-agricultural occupations. Seamen were shorter, heavier, had more
abdominal fat, and less lifting strength. Gould (1869) argued that the short heights of seamen
were not due to the navy selecting shorter men, but to the hardship of a seafaring life while still in
the growing years (up to age 25 in the nineteenth century). Finally, note that war-time experience,
proxied by being in low vigor, affects only BMI, lifting strength, and vital capacity.
Tables 9, 10, and 11 examine the predictors of anthropometric measures among the
native-born.

Restricting the sample to the native-born allows me to examine the effects of

parents’ nativity, size of city of birth, and education. Having a US-born father and mother
significantly increases average height relative to having parents who are born abroad and there

4

Among Norwegian men age 50-64, mortality risk is minimized at higher weights for the short than for the tall.

is weak evidence that having just one US-born parent increases height as well, though not by as
much. Men with both parents born in the US were lighter than men with parents born abroad, even
controlling for height (not shown). Those born in large cities were shorter, lighter, and had less
lifting strength, but they also had less abdominal fat. Recall that babies born in the Philadelphia
alsmhouse had birth weights that compared favorably to those of mid-twentieth century babies
(Goldin and Margo 1989), suggesting that life in a large city was best experienced in the protected
environment of the womb. Finally, note that education has no predictive power, perhaps both
because the labor market returns to formal education were low and because knowledge of midnineteenth medicine may only have harmed health.5

Anthropometric Measures: Older Age Mortality

Were anthropometric measures good predictors of subsequent mortality among Union Army
veterans? To test this, I examined whether height, BMI, abdominal fat, muscle strength, and
vital capacity predicted mortality from ischemic heart disease and stroke conditional on survival
to 1900. The discussion in this section is restricted to height, BMI, and abdominal fat because
muscle strength and vital capacity were not good predictors and sample size was too small to
examine deaths from respiratory disease.
I model Union Army veterans’ waiting time until death from ischemic or cerebrovascular
heart disease by means of a Cox proportional hazard model. The hazard, (t), or the rate at which
spells are completed after duration t given that they last until at least t, is

(t)

Among civilians age 26 to 35 in the Third National Health and Examination Survey the better educated are taller
and have a smaller waist-hip ratio (author’s calculation). (Waist-hip ratio in these data is not comparable to that in
the Gould sample.)

21

where

0 is the baseline hazard and exp(x0

)

is the relative hazard. The covariates of primary

interest are health measures and these consist of BMI and BMI squared, a dummy equal to one
if the veterans’ height was one standard deviation above the mean and dummies equal to one
if the veterans’ abdominal fat measures were one standard deviation above the mean and one
standard deviation below the mean. Additional controls include age in 1900, occupation from the
Gould sample (agricultural, professional or proprietor, artisan, or laborer), and a dummy equal to
one if the recruit was in low vigor when measured.6 I use a competing risk framework, treating
individuals who die from a cause of death other than ischemic or cerebrovascular disease as
censored.
Table 12 shows that BMI and waist-hip ratios are the best predictors of subsequent
mortality. Both high and low waist-hip ratios predict ischemic and stroke mortality. A waist-hip
ratio that was more than one standard deviation above the mean increases mortality risk by 2.7
times relative to the mean controlling for BMI. Note that optimal BMI is 24.5 when no other
anthropometric controls are included in the regression and 23.5 controlling for height and waisthip ratio, somewhat on the high end but within the generally accepted range. Dummy variables
indicating high and low BMI levels were insignificant. Being tall is marginally significant only
when controlling for BMI and abdominal fat. High and low chest-shoulder ratios are insignificant,
but do elevate mortality risk. High and low chest-height ratios are insignificant and lower mortality
risk. None of the anthropometric measures were statistically significant predictors of all-cause
mortality.
How would Union Army veterans have fared if in their youth they had the characteristics
of men in the 1950 military? Their 15 year all-cause mortality rate would have been lower by
up to 6 percent, implying that changes in frame size explain up to three-fifths of the total decline

Education had no predictive power.

Years until death are measured from 1900. The dummy variables are equal to one if the individual is one standard
deviation above (for tall or high) or below (for low) the sample mean. The symbols , y, and z indicate that the coefficient
is significantly different from 1 at the 10, 5, and 1 percent level, respectively. Standard errors in parentheses. Covariates
include age in 1900, occupation from the Gould sample, and whether the recruit was in low vigor during the war. The

in all cause mortality at older ages from 1915 to 1988. Using regression 6 in Table 12 and
anthropometric means for white men from the Gould sample yields a predicted mortality rate
from ischemic heart disease or stroke of 22.1 percent by 1915. Substituting the anthropometric
means for whites in the 1950 military into the regression equation decreased the heart disease
mortality rate to 18.6 percent. Thus, rather having 18 percent of the sample dying from ischemic
heart disease or stroke, only 15 percent would have died.7
Changes in body size predict that older age mortality rates will have declined at a much
more rapid rate by 2022. Substituting in the anthropometric means for whites in the 1988 military
into the regression equation decreased the heart mortality to 16.3 percent and implies a reduction
in the all-cause 1915 15 year mortality rate of 9 percent.8 On an annual basis the percentage point
decline in mortality rates due to changes in body shape between 1915 and 1988 was 0.08. Between
1988 and 2022 changes in body size imply an annual percentage point decline in mortality rates
of 0.12.
Black men in the mid-nineteenth century had predicted older age mortality rates that
compared favorably with those of whites. Their predicted 15 year mortality rate from ischemic
heart disease and stroke was 22.2 percent (using regression 6 and the sample means of black men

7

The means for whites for high waist-hip ratio (above 0.91), low waist hip ratio (less than or equal to 0.81), tall
(above 176.8 cm), and BMI were 0.110, 0.144, 0.135, and 22.7 in the Gould sample. The same means for whites
in the 1950 military were 0.076, 0.217, 0.419, and 24.0. Among men in the Gould sample linked to the pension
records, 54 percent of the sample had died by 1915 and 34 percent of all deaths were from ischemic heart disease or
stroke. Eighteen percent of the sample was therefore dead from ischemic heart or stroke by 1915. The regression
results suggest that mortality from stroke or ischemic heart disease would have fallen by 16 percent if men had had
a modern frame size. Therefore only 15 percent of the sample would have died from ischemic heart or stroke and
only 51 percent of the sample would have died. (Note that this is an upper bound because men who died of heart
disease may have died of other causes.) Using the epidemiological follow-up of the 1971-1974 National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey shows that, adjusting for the age-distribution, the 15 year mortality rate was 49
percent.
8

The sample means for high waist-hip ratio, low waist-hip ratio, tall, and BMI in the 1988 data were 0.071, 0.149,
0.430, and 25.1, respectively. The regression results imply that mortality from ischemic heart disease or stroke would
have fallen by 26 percent or that only 13 percent of the sample would have died from ischemic heart disease or stroke.
Only 49 percent of the sample would then have died from all causes.

24

in the Gould sample and assuming that the relationship between anthropometric measures and
older age mortality is the same for white and black men), the same as the predicted rate for whites.
Although blacks were shorter than whites, their waist-hip ratios were the same and their greater
BMIs more than made up for their shorter heights. However, today blacks’ greater BMI puts them
at higher risk. Using the sample means for black men in the 1988 army lowers the predicted 15
year ischemic heart disease and stroke mortality rate to only 20.9 percent.9 Note, however, that
because optimal BMI is sensitive to the specification and, in large samples, lies in a broad range,
the mortality declines attributable to changes in frame size may well be underestimated.10

Conclusion

This paper has shown that there have been substantial changes in the human frame over the last
hundred years. Not only have men become taller and heavier, but they now have relatively less
abdominal fat as well. Abdominal fat was a better predictor of mortality from ischemic heart
disease or stroke than height or BMI. Changes in frame size have lowered risk of death from
ischemic heart disease or stroke and explain roughly three-fifths of the mortality decline among
white men between 1915 and 1988. Low birth weights and exposure to infectious disease, poor
nutritional intake, and the demands of work both during the growing years and in adulthood have
been pointed to as factors that contribute to a high risk frame. In the mid-nineteenth century
populations that faced a higher risk of death because of their frame size included the foreign-born
and large city dwellers, but not blacks. Although black slaves experienced severe nutritional

9
The means for blacks for in the Gould sample were 0.103, 0.106, 0.087, and 23.5 and in the 1988 army 0.018,
0.199, 0.457, and 25.5.
10

This may explain why, assuming that the same anthropometric standards applied to whites can be applied to
Indians, Indians’ predicted mortality rate from ischemic heart disease and stroke was 24.6 percent, higher than that
of whites or blacks.

deprivation in their childhood, their heavier weights as adults provided enough protection so that
their predicted older age mortality was similar to that of whites. This paper also documented
frame size among Indians, providing some suggestive evidence that the Indians of upper New
York state experienced a deterioration in health status.
Changes in frame size are still on-going. Men in the 1988 military were heavier and
taller than men in the military of the 1950s but had the same abdominal fat patterning controlling
for BMI. When these men reach late middle age in 2022, their mortality rates will be even lower
than those faced by men in the late 1980s. Changes in frame size imply that, cetribus paribus,
mortality rates will decline at a much more rapid rate than they have in the past. Because not
all improvements in early life conditions are manifested as changes in frame size and because
medical interventions at older ages are likely to continue to lower mortality rates, future declines
in mortality rates may be sizable.

Data Appendix
The Gould sample was collected from the Statistical Bureau Archives of the United States Sanitary
Commission in the New York Public Library. A randomly chosen sub-sample was then linked
to the pension records in the National Archives. The data are available for download from
the National Bureau of Economic Research, http://www.nber.org. The 1950 Survey of Flying
Personnel and the 1988 Anthropometric Survey U.S. Army were obtained from the Human
Systems Information Analysis Center (HSIAC) of the United States Military.

7.1 The Gould Sample
Every effort was made by the United States Sanitary Commission to ensure accuracy in measurement. Examiners were trained, furnished with printed instructions, and provided with measuring

26

instruments. Reports from Examiners were sent in weekly and returns were tabulated as soon as
possible to check for errors. When a discrepancy did arise, the examiner was consulted for further
information (Gould 1869: 225-228). Although later measurements were thought to be more reliable (Gould 1869: 256) there is little difference in the means. Some erroneous measurements did
result from examiners’ misunderstanding of the instructions, but mismeasurement was a problem
only for variables that are of minor interest, such as head circumferences and facial angles (Gould
1869: 239).
Two different basic forms were used by the examiners. Form E was the first schedule
used, for close to 8000 men, until it was replaced by Form EE. (See Tables 13 and 14 for
the variables.) In addition, a schedule of social questions accompanied Form E. The machinereadable data set contains 6,512 Form E schedules (including 2,216 abridged versions of Form
E) and 13,701 Form EE schedules. Only 252 social question schedules were found (and input)
but these could not be linked to their accompanying Form E schedules.
As previously noted, relative to the Union Army the Gould sample over-represents
recruits born in the Middle Atlantic, yielding a shorter sample and one with fewer farmers (see
Table 15).

7.2 Anthropometric Variables Used in the Analysis
All variables in the Gould sample were originally measured in inches and pounds and were
converted to metric units. In general men removed their shoes, coats, and waistcoats for the
examination but retained their trousers and under-clothing. However, examiners were specifically
instructed to measure chest circumference under the shirt. Gould (1869) describes examination
procedures. Hertzberg et al. (1954) and Clauser et al. (1988) describe examination procedures
for the 1950 and 1988 surveys.

Sources: Nativities in (1) are from Gould (1869: 256) and in (2) from Gould (1869: 104-105). Percent farmer
in (1) is from the machine-readable Gould sample and in (2) from Fogel et al. (1990). Heights in (1) are from
the machine-readable Gould sample and in (2) from Gould (1869: 27). The machine-readable Gould sample
was restricted to white soldiers only (seamen were excluded).

 Height. In the Gould sample heights were measured with an andrometer.
 Weight. In the Gould sample weight was measured with platform scales graduated to
quarters of a pound.
 Waist circumference. In the Gould sample waist circumference is measured as circumference of the waist above the hips and below the ribs. The midpoint is the natural waist
circumference and this is what is measured in the 1950 and 1988 military surveys.
 Hip circumference. In the Gould sample circumference around the hips is measured on the
level of the trochanters. This is generally, but not always, equivalent to measuring maximal
buttock circumference. The 1950 and 1988 military samples use the latter measures.
 Chest circumference. Chest circumference was measured over the nipples and under
clothing. For Form EE measurements, examiners were told to measure both while the lungs
were fully inflated and after exhalation. No instructions were given for Form E. I used the
mean value of circumference at maximal inspiration and circumference at full exhalation.
The mean value calculated from Form EE was similar to that calculated from Form E.
Restricting the sample to Form EE did not affect the mortality regressions. Both the 1950
and 1988 surveys measured chest circumference at the level of the nipples, but the 1950
instructions only specified that it be measured during natural breathing whereas the 1988
instructions specified that it be measured at the maximal point of quiet respiration.
30

 Shoulder (biacromial) breadth. In Form E how breadth of shoulders was to be measured
was unspecified but in Form EE it was measured as breadth of shoulders between the
acromion processes. Means across the two forms, however, were similar. Both the 1950
and 1988 surveys measure biacromial diameter from acromion to acromion.
 Lifting Strength. Lifting strength was strength in pulling upward, as measured by a dynamometer. Because lifting strength depends upon how the dynamometer was constructed,
measures in the Gould sample may not be comparable to recent measures.
 Vital Capacity. Vital capacity is measured by having the subject inspire maximally and
then expire as rapidly and as completely as possible into a spirometer. Total lung capacity
is reached at the point of maximal inspiration and residual volume is the amount of air left
in the patient’s lungs after maximal expiration. The difference between total lung capacity
and residual volume is forced vital capacity, simply referred to as vital capacity in the paper.
Measurements of vital capacity in the Gould sample understate true vital capacity and are
not even comparable with measurements performed in the nineteenth century because of
widespread differences in measurement by instrument (Hutchinson 1852). However, that
vital capacity in the sample increases, as expected, with height and BMI, and decreases with
age among men aged 25-49 provides evidence of its reliability within the Gould sample.
