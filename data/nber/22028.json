    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper explores whether affine models with volatility jumps estimated on intradaily S&P 500 futures data over 1983-2008 can capture major daily outliers such as the 1987 stock market crash.  I find that intradaily jumps in futures prices are typically small, and that self-exciting but short-lived volatility spikes capture intradaily and daily returns better.  Multifactor models of the evolution of diffusive variance and jump intensities improve fits substantially, including out-of-sample over 2009-13.  The models capture reasonably well the conditional distributions of daily returns and of realized variance outliers, but underpredict realized variance inliers.\n\n",
