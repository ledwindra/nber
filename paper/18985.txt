A Bargaining Theory of Trade Invoicing and Pricing
Linda S. Goldberg and Cédric Tille
NBER Working Paper No. 18985
April 2013
JEL No. F2,F3,F4
ABSTRACT
We develop a theoretical model of international trade pricing in which individual exporters and importers
bargain over the transaction price and exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. We find that the choice
of price and invoicing currency reflects the full market structure, including the extent of fragmentation
and the degree of heterogeneity across importers and across exporters. Our study shows that a party
has a higher effective bargaining weight when it is large or more risk tolerant. A higher effective bargaining
weight of importers relative to exporters in turn translates into lower import prices and greater exchange
rate pass-through into import prices. We show the range of price and invoicing outcomes that arise
under alternative market structures. Such structures matter not only for the outcome of specific exporter-importer
transactions, but also for aggregate variables such as the average price, the average choice of invoicing
currency, and the correlation between invoicing currency and the size of trade transactions.

Introduction

What determines the currency used in the invoicing of international trade?
This question is the subject of an extensive theoretical and empirical research
agenda in international economics as it plays a central role in determining whom
among exporters or importers bear the cost of exchange rate ‡uctuations, and
whether these ‡uctuations a¤ect trade quantities. The existing theoretical literature has identi…ed a host of determinants of the choice of invoicing currency in
international trade, including a "coalescing" motive for exporters to keep their
prices close to their competitors’, a "hedging" motive to movements in marginal
revenue in line with marginal cost ‡uctuations, transaction costs in foreign exchange markets, and the role of macroeconomic conditions that favor the use of
low volatility currencies.1
A limit of existing contributions is the assumption that the choice of the invoicing currency rests solely with the exporter, who takes into account the downward
sloping demand of importers. This assumption of unilateral decision-making is
however at odds with growing evidence that the invoicing choice re‡ects a bargaining between exporters and importers (see Friberg and Wilander 2008 and Ito
et al. 2012).
This paper addresses this limit by developing a richer model of the interaction between exporters and importers. We develop a simple model of bargaining
between individual exporters and importers, with each taking into account the
outside option of her counterpart. The negotiating covers both the allocation of
exchange rate risk through the choice of invoicing currency and the price level in
that currency.2

Aggregate macroeconomic conditions impoly choosing a currency with low transaction costs
(Devereux and Shi 2005 and Portes and Rey 2001), low macroeconomic volatility (Devereux,
Engel, and Storgaard 2004), and hedging bene…ts which take into account the use of imported
inputs (Novy 2006). The role of exporter market share is emphasized (Bacchetta and van
Wincoop 2005, and Auer and Schoenle 2012), as is coalescing across his competitors contingent on
demand elasticities and production curvature (Goldberg and Tille 2008). Endogenous currency
choice also arises in a framework of uncertain timing of future price resets (Gopinath, Itskhoki,
and Rigobon 2010).

In our model a range of exporters produce goods at a cost and sell them to
a range of importers, who in turn resell these goods in their domestic market.
Each exporter - importer pair bargains over the two aspects of the contract: a
preset contract price that prevails in the absence of exchange rate movements
between the time of contracting and the time of the actual transaction, and the
allocation of exposure to exchange rate movements around that preset price (i.e.
the invoicing currency), which maps directly to rates of ex-post exchange rate
pass through. We consider a standard Nash bargaining that maximizes a joint
surplus which is a weighted average of the exporter’s and importer’s surpluses,
with the weights referred to as the formal bargaining weights of the parties.3 As all
exporters transact with all importers in equilibrium, the surplus that an exporter
gets from a successful match with a speci…c importer is the utility of the pro…ts
from transacting with all importers minus the utility of the pro…ts from transacting
with all importers except the speci…c importer in the bargaining. The surplus for
an importer is de…ned similarly.
Our analysis includes three key ingredients. First, exporters and importers
have a concave valuation of payo¤s. Failing to reach an agreement with a large
counterpart then has a larger impact on the marginal valuation of payo¤s than
failing to reach one with a small counterpart. Second, uncertainty plays a central
role as the bargaining takes place before exchange rate ‡uctuations are realized.
Third, we allow for heterogeneity of exporters and importers, with heterogeneity
taking the form of numbers of counterparts or relative sizes of counterparts. To our
knowledge this paper is the …rst analysis of the joint determination of pricing and
invoicing through a bargaining in the presence of uncertainty and heterogenous
valuations of payo¤s.
The key relations in our analysis are the …rst-order conditions that maximize
the joint surplus of a speci…c exporter - importer pair with respect to the preset
price and the exchange rate exposure. Two conditions are derived for each exporter
- importer pair. As they are highly non-linear, we …rst solve for the optimal
prices in a steady-state with no uncertainty. We then solve for the exchange rate
exposure by relying on a quadratic approximation around the steady-state, such an
approximation being needed to capture the second moments that drive the choice
without a focus on the importer competition or bargaining, include deBlas and Russ (2012) and
Garetto (2012).

The weights are the same across all exporter - importer pairs.

of exposure. In general the preset price and exposure choice for a speci…c exporter
- importer pair depends on the choices for other pairs, as these a¤ect the marginal
value of payo¤s for the parties. As this leads to a highly complex solution, we
consider two speci…c cases to highlight the key results. The …rst case focuses on
the degree of fragmentation among exporters and among importers, de…ned as the
number of identical agents in each group. The second case emphasizes intra-group
heterogeneity, de…ned as the relative size of agents within each group, setting the
number of agents per group to two.
The analysis leads to a number of novel results. First, the outcomes of the
bargaining re‡ects the e¤ective bargaining weights of the counterparts that di¤er
from the formal weights in the joint surplus. A counterpart gets a higher e¤ective
bargaining weight when she is big and when the concavity of her valuation of payo¤s
is limited. The size of a counterpart is measured by the share of her counterpart’s
payo¤s that she accounts for in equilibrium.4 Second, the preset price is tilted
in favor of the counterpart with the highest e¤ective bargaining weight. This
party then gets most of the surplus from the match, but also has a lower marginal
value of payo¤s relative to the other party due to the concavity of valuation of
payo¤s. Third, the counterpart with the highest e¤ective bargaining weight bears
more of the exchange rate risk. This result is both interesting and intuitive. This
counterpart has a relatively low marginal value of payo¤s, which implies that expost movements have a relatively limited impact on marginal utility. These results
also underscore the importance of considering a bargaining process that covers all
aspects of the price contract, and not just the exchange rate exposure. Fourth,
in the presence of intra-group heterogeneity, the relative sizes of agents within
each group a¤ect the outcome not only for speci…c pairs but also in aggregate
terms. Speci…cally, a situation of high exporter heterogeneity (with one exporter
dominating the market) is characterized by a higher average level of preset prices
across pairs, a higher average exposure of exporters to exchange rate movements
(more importer currency pricing), and a positive correlation between the value of
transactions and the exchange rate exposure of exporters.
In addition to its contribution to our understanding of the determinants of international trade invoicing and price-setting, this paper provides a methodological
contribution by solving a bargaining model under uncertainty where the marginal

importer’s pro…ts that stems from buying and selling the goods produced by the exporter.

valuations of payo¤s di¤ers across the parties. As outlined in the discussion of
the related literature, existing contributions consider some of the aspects of our
framework (such as uncertainty or di¤erent valuations of payo¤s), but our analysis
is to our knowledge the …rst that encompasses the combined features.
The paper is organized as follows. We review the related literature on pricing
and invoicing currency choice, as well as on bargaining games, in Section 2. Section 3 presents the main features of the model, and Section 4 provides the solution
method. Sections 5 derives the outcomes for preset prices and exchange rate exposure in speci…c examples, focusing …rst on fragmentation and then on intra-group
heterogeneity among exporters and importers. Section 6 concludes. Throughout
the paper we focus on an intuitive presentation of the main points. The key technical aspects are presented in the Appendix and the detailed derivations are in a
Technical Appendix available on request.

Related literature

Our work …ts in the literature on invoicing choice and price adjustments in international economics, providing additional theoretical underpinnings on the roles of
…rm and industry-level heterogeneity that are found to be important in empirical studies. Goldberg and Tille (2011) consider a highly disaggregated data set
of Canadian imports and …nd a robust link between invoice currency choice, the
size of individual transactions, and heterogeneity of transacting agents. Berman,
Martin, and Mayer (2012) analyze rich data for French …rms and …nd that high
performance …rms have markups that respond more to exchange rate movements,
and are more willing to engage in producer currency pricing.5 Gopinath, Itskhoki,
and Rigobon (2010) show that invoice currency choice is closely related to the
pass-through of cost ‡uctuations into …nal prices in the United States, with much
higher pass-through for import prices set in currencies other than the dollar. Price
rigidities do not fully explain this phenomenon. 6
5

For these …rms, quantities of high performance …rms also respond by less to exchange rate
changes. Sectoral heterogeneity in pricing also varies according to types of goods, with more
local currency pricing on consumer goods than intermediate goods, and more for sectors with
higher distribution costs.
6
As our model assumes that prices are fully preset, up to the exchange rate exposure, we
cannot consider the relation between the choice of invoicing and the response of prices to cost

Our paper also relates to the industrial organization literature on bargaining games between suppliers and retailers. To our knowledge, our paper is the
…rst contribution introducing bargaining between buyers (exporters) and sellers
(importers) in the context of concave valuation of payo¤s in an uncertain environment. The nearest contributions include DeGraba (2005), who presents a model
where the valuation of goods varies across buyers. Sellers make price o¤ers that
the buyers can accept or refuse. As the seller cannot observe the true valuation
of her counterpart, she has an incentive to o¤er better conditions to larger buyers
as loosing a large customer is more costly than loosing a larger one. While the
DeGraba model includes uncertainty, it does so in the form of idiosyncratic valuations and thus abstracts from the role of aggregate risk such as that arising from
exchange rate movements. The role of curvature in valuation, which we assume,
has a precedent in the framework of Normann et al. (2003) wherein a seller with
increasing marginal costs of production makes take it or leave it o¤ers to buyers.
The seller o¤ers a lower price to large buyers as large sales take place at a point
on the curve schedule where the marginal cost his low. The setting however does
not include uncertainty.
A number of other papers provide theoretical precedent for our treatment of
counterpart heterogeneity and fragmentation through their focus on merger incentives in multi-agents games. Inderst and Wey (2003) develop a framework where
prices are set between two retailers and two producers, but assume that all agents
share the same marginal valuation of resources in contrast to our setting of heterogenous concave valuations.7 Horn and Wolinsky (1988) analyze a setting with
two buyers and two sellers where the marginal valuation of the price can di¤er between buyers and sellers, and focus on the incentives of agents to merge and form
a monopoly, showing that this is not necessarily an optimal choice because of the
impact on bargaining power. The model, however, assumes that each buyer only
purchases from one seller, and thus abstracts from the ability of buyers to play one
seller against another to gain a better bargaining position. Dowbson and Waterson
(1997) consider a larger number of identical buyers, but abstract from uncertainty
‡uctuations. Our assumption is motivated by our focus on invoicing in a novel pricing framework,
and extending it to include price adjustment is left for future work. The relevance of market
structure for invoicing is likely to extend to price adjustment as well.
7
Similarly, Chipty and Snyder (1999) focus on the incentives for mergers among buyers and
sellers assuming that they share the same marginal valuation of the price.

and heterogeneity in payo¤s’valuation. Camera and Selcuk (2009) show how price
heterogeneity can arise in a setting with homogenous buyers and homogenous sellers, but abstract from uncertainty. This follows from capacity constraints faced by
sellers, while the heterogeneity in our model re‡ect di¤erent sizes of agents. Selcuk
(2012) introduces risk averse di¤erences between buyers and sellers. A seller faced
with risk-averse buyers opts to set a …xed price so that buyers are not exposed
to ex-post price risk. In his setting the price, the risk facing the buyer is due to
limited sellers’inventories, instead of the macroeconomic risk that we consider. In
addition, risk aversion is limited to one side of the market.
Overall, our setting di¤ers from the existing theoretical contributions in the industrial organization literature in that we consider aggregate uncertainty, heterogenous marginal valuation of payo¤s through concave valuations, and heterogeneity
in terms of agents sizes.

An exporter-importer bargaining model
Structure and payo¤s

Two types of agents are in the model: importers and exporters. There are M
importers indexed by j, and X exporters indexed by i. Exporters sell goods to
importers, who in turn resell these goods to customers in the destination country.
A speci…c importer m buys Qxm units of goods from a speci…c exporter x and
resells these goods at a price Zm in her currency. Exporter x has an average
production cost denoted by Cxm and denominated in her currency. Each importer
can purchase goods from all exporters, and each exporter can sell goods to all
importers. When transactions occur for all exporter-importer pairs (which is the
case in equilibrium) the payo¤ of importer m is a concave valuation of her expected
pro…ts:

where E is the expectation operator, M captures the concavity of the importer’s
valuation of payo¤s (and her risk aversion) that is common to all importers, and
m
Pim
is the price charged by exporter i to importer m, with the m superscript
denoting that this price is expressed in the importer’s currency. The payo¤ of

Ux =

M

(2)

where X captures the concavity of the exporter’s valuation of payo¤s (common
x
to all exporters), and Pxj
is the price charged by exporter x to importer j, with
the x subscript denoting that it is expressed in the exporter’s currency. The
speci…cations (1)-(2) encompass two key features of the model, namely the presence
of uncertainty with the valuation of payo¤s being from an ex-ante perspective, and
the concave valuation of payo¤s re‡ected by the constant relative risk aversion
paramaters, M and X , that can di¤er between exporters and importers.
Our analysis focuses on the price charged by exporter x to importer m. It
f
entails two contractual components: a preset price component Pxm
that is …xed
before shocks are realized, and the extent to which the price in the importer’s
currency moves with ex-post ‡uctuations in the exchange rate. Speci…cally, we
denote the percentage of exchange rate movements that are transmitted to the
importer’s price by 1
xm , where xm 2 (0; 1). We interpret xm as the extent
of local currency pricing (LCP), which corresponds to the share of exchange rate
movements that are absorbed by the exporter. If xm = 1 the importer is shielded
from exchange rate ‡uctuations, corresponding to full local currency pricing. If
xm = 0 the exporter’s price is shielded from exchange rate ‡uctuations, a case
referred to as producer currency pricing (PCP) in the literature.8 The exchange rate
S is de…ned as units of exporter’s currency per unit of importer’s currency, so that
an increase corresponds to a depreciation of the exporter’s currency. We assume,
without loss of generality, that the log exchange rate s is normally distributed
around zero.
The price paid by the importer in her currency is:
m

Pxm

Similarly the price received by the exporter in her currency is:

S = Pxm

Engel (2006) and Goldberg and Tille (2008) provide equivalence results on optimal exchange
rate pass through and invoice currency choice when prices are sticky.

7

The price between exporter x and importer m is determined through bilateral
bargaining. A key element is the surplus that each counterpart gains from a
successful match (de…ned as a negotiation that leads the pair xm to undertake a
transaction). In equilibrium there are transactions between all importer-exporter
pairs, as all transactions generate some positive surplus making both exporter
and importer better o¤ by transacting. The surplus of the importer (exporter)
speci…cally generated by the xm transaction is the value of the payo¤ for the
importer (exporter) from conducting transactions with all counterparts, minus the
payo¤ she would get from conducting transactions with all counterparts except x
(m).9
Speci…cally, the expected surplus that importer m derives from its negotiation
with exporter x is:

We allow for the quantity Qxm to be price sensitive. Speci…cally, the demand
by m for goods produced by x is inversely related to the ratio between the price
m
m
Pxm
charged by x to m, and a reference price denoted by Rxm
which re‡ects the
prices that m gets from other competing exporters. We consider a constant price

elasticity of demand . The reference price Rxm
is of a form similar to the price
m

Pxm , and consists of a …xed component Rxm and a component that is sensitive
m

of the reference price is provided in the numerical examples of sections 4 and 5.
The quantity sold from x to m is then written as:
Qxm = Qset

Pxm
m;f
Rxm

S(

(5)

where Qset
xm is the exogenous component of demand, which is not a¤ected by the
outcome of the price and invoice currency bargaining.
The quantity Qxm is produced according to a decreasing returns to scale technology which uses an input Lxm . We assume that the technology, and hence the
average and marginal costs, apply separately to each xm pair.10 Speci…cally the
technology is Qxm = Axm (Lxm ) where Axm is a constant parameter and
1.
For simplicity, we assume that the production by exporter x of the goods she sells
to m is not a¤ected by the quantities she sells to other importers, and so are the
average cost Cxm and the marginal cost M Cxm = 1 Cxm .11 We allow for the unit
cost of the input to be a¤ected by the exchange rate, for example due to the use
of imported inputs in production, and denote the unit cost by Wx S x where Wx
is exogenous and x is the elasticity of the cost with respect to the exchange rate.
Under this speci…cation the marginal cost of production is:

We consider a partial equilibrium setting in order to focus on the interaction
between the respective exporters and importers. In particular, we take several
variables to be exogenous, such as the exchange rate S, the …nal price Zm , the
m
wage Wx , the reference price Rxm
, and the demand shifter Qset
xm . We consider that
these variables are stochastic, and possibly correlated.

Determination of price

The two components of the contract negotiated between x and m, namely the
preset contract price pfxm and the extent of invoicing in the importer’s currency

Accordingly, there is no spillover of the outcome between a speci…c importer-exporter pair
and the costs for another transacting pair.
11
This can be interpreted as x operating a plant producing only for sales to m. If instead we
assume that the plant produces for all of x’s customers, sales to importers other than m would
a¤ect the marginal cost of selling to m.

are set to maximize a combination of the exporter’s and importer’s surpluses
(3) and (4). We consider a Nash bargaining where the combination is a geometric
averages of the surpluses, with weights representing the formal bargaining weights
of the parties. This approach is standard in the bargaining literature, as in Chipty
and Snyder (1999), Dowbson and Waterson (1997), and Horn and Wolinsky (1988).
Speci…cally we de…ne the joint surplus of a match between x and m as:

where captures the formal weight of the importer in the bargaining, and is
assumed to be the same for all xm pairs. It re‡ects the role that the importer
plays in determining the price and invoicing. The cases of = 0 is the situation
where the exporter makes the decision unilaterally to maximize her surplus given
her knowledge of all the relevant parameters of demand. Similarly, the importer
is the sole decider when = 1. Each party has an equal say when = 0:5. The
assumption that the two parties have identical weights (i.e = 0:5) is standard in
the literature (Chipty and Snyder 1999, Dowbson and Waterson 1997, and Horn
and Wolinsky 1988)

Our framework di¤ers signi…cantly from, and complements, that of Gopinath, Itskhoki and
Rigobon (2010). Our model focuses on the interaction between heterogeneous exporters and
importers. We abstract from dynamics by considering an ex-ante stage with the negotiation over
the terms of a contract that yields the relevant decisions on ex ante pricing and allocation of
exchange rate risk, and an ex-post stage where shocks are realized and exchange rate movements
are transmitted to prices according to the agreed exposure. Unlike the multiperiod framework
of Gopinath, Itskhoki and Rigobon (2010), we do not consider staggered and uncertain timing
of pricing adjustments, and thus cannot discuss the connection between exchange rate exposure
and pass-through at the time when prices are adjusted, which is central in their analysis.

Solution method
Steady state

The …rst-order conditions (8) and (9) are non-linear functions of the pricing
components not only between x and m, but also between x and the other importers,
as well as between m and the other exporters. This re‡ects the fact that the
surpluses (3)-(4) are a¤ected by all of the exporter-importer transactions.
As there is no closed-form solution of the system (8) and (9), we consider
approximations around a steady state where there is no uncertainty. We denote
steady-state variables with an upper bar. Without loss of generality we assume
that the exchange rate is equal to unity: S = 1. The price in any currency then
m
x
f
corresponds to its preset component (Pxm
= Pxm
= Pxm
) which we denote by Pxm
for brevity.
A convenient way to capture the relevance of importer m for exporter x is to
compute the share of x’s total pro…ts that are accounted for by sales to m:
m
xm

Pxm
= PM
j=1

m
xm

Cxm Qxm
Pxj

(10)

Cxj Qxj

with a high value of
indicating that the importer m is large from the point of
view of the exporter x. Similarly the relevance of exporter x for importer m is the
share of m’s pro…ts that come from sales of goods provided by x:
x
xm

Zm
= PX
i=1

x
xm

Pxm Qxm
Zm

(11)

Pim Qim

with a high value of
indicating that the exporter x is large from the point of
view of the importer m.
The invoicing share xm does not enter the steady-state solution.13 Intuitively,
it is not a meaningful dimension of the model in the absence of exchange rate
‡uctuations.14 We therefore focus on the steady state value of (8) which is:
~xm Pxm
=

M C xm

(12)

Speci…cally, both sides of (9) are zero when evaluated at the steady state.
A parallel intuition arises in the context of the allocation of wealth into a portfolio of various
assets. If all assets yield the same return with certainty, investors are indi¤erent across portfolios.

(13)

where H ixm ; j is a function that is increasing and convex in both argument,
with a positive cross-derivative.15 It is equal to one when j = 0 and goes from
one to in…nity as ixm goes from zero to one.16
~xm re‡ects the e¤ective bargaining weight of importer m vis-a-vis exporter x,
and is a function of the concavity of valuations of payo¤s, the shares (10)-(11) and
the formal weight . The e¤ective bargaining weight of the importer corresponds
to the formal weight (~xm = ) only when agents have a linear valuation of pro…ts
( X = M = 0). Otherwise, (13) is an increasing function importer size, m
xm , a dex
creasing function of the exporter size, xm , a decreasing function of the importer’s
risk aversion, M , and an increasing fucntion of the exporter’s risk aversion, X .
Intuitively, failing to reach an agreement with a large importer leaves the exporter
with low pro…ts, and thus a high marginal valuation of pro…ts as (2) is concave. As
result, the exporter cares more about striking an agreement with a larger importer
than with a smaller one.
(12) takes a simple form if demand is not price sensitive ( = 0). The price is
then a simple average between the average production cost and the resale price:
Pxm = ~xm C xm + 1

~xm Zm

A high e¤ective bargaining weight of the importer brings the price close to the
production cost, thus shifting the allocation of the margin between the …nal price
and the cost towards the importer. The opposite is the case when the importer’s
e¤ective weight is low.
When demand is price sensitive ( > 0), (12) takes the form of a quadratic

makes negative pro…ts (Pxm > Zm ). The …rst root by contrast implies that both
the exporter and the importer make positive pro…ts (Pxm > C xm and Zm > Pxm ).
Our analysis shows that the steady state solution is a …xed point characterized
by the shares of the exporter (importer) in their counterpart’s payo¤, (10)-(11),
which are functions of the prices between them, and by the price (12) which is a
function of the shares (10)-(11) through the e¤ective bargaining weight (13). The
steady-state solution is the …xed point of these relations. While we cannot derive
an analytical solution for this …xed point in general, we can compute the solution
for speci…c cases presented in section 5.17

4.2

Approximation around the steady state

The next step of the solution method is to expand the …rst-order conditions
(8) and (9) around the steady-state. Our analysis requires us to consider quadratic
log approximations for two reasons. First, the extent of LCP xm determines who
bears the exchange rate risk outside of the steady state. Computing xm then
requires that we include the second moments of the equations through a quadratic
f
, di¤ers from the
approximation. Second, the preset component of the price, Pxm
steady state price Pxm in (12) in the presence of risk, as forward-looking agents
take account of the second moments when setting the price.18 Speci…cally, the
f
= Pxm exp [% 2 ] where % is a
preset component of the price can be written as Pxm
coe¢ cient and 2 is proportional to the variances of the (log of the) shocks to the
exchange rate, …nal prices, wages, and demand shifters. We denote the logarithms
of the various variables by lower case letters.
As shown below, the extent of LCP xm is computed using the quadratic approximation of (9) across all xm pairs. The log of preset prices pfxm can then be
computed from the quadratic approximation of (8). In our analysis we focus on
the …rst step and abstract from the second step for two reasons. First, solving
17

The presence of decreasing returns to scale ( < 1) implies that the size of the exogenous
output for the xm pair, Qset
xm in (5), a¤ects the marginal and average costs for the pair, making
the analysis more complex. In the remainder of our analysis, we shut this dimension down by
1
appropriately scaling the productivity Axm to Qset
, so that Qset
xm and Axm o¤set each other
xm
in the steady state marginal cost (6).

This element is a standard feature in the analysis of optimal monetary policy in models
where prices are set ex-ante by forward looking agents.

for the invoicing shares does not require knowing the price gap between pfxm and
ln Pxm . Second, the gap is of the form % 2 and can thus be set to be arbitrarily
small by choosing a small variance of shocks. By contrast, the invoicing shares
xm are independent from the volatility of shocks (as long as this volatility is not
zero).19
We expand (9) around the steady state with respect to the logs of the preset component of the price pfxm , the exogenous exchange rate s, the exogenous
component of the input cost wx , the exogenous …nal price zm , and the exogenous
set 20
. We denote logs deviation from the steady state with
component of demand qxm
hatted values: z^m = zm ln Zm .

The …rst three rows of (14) re‡ect various aspects for the xm pair that a¤ect
the optimal LCP. The …rst driver is the comovement between the …nal price and
1
the exchange rate, (E z^m s^) (E^
s2 ) . If the …nal price moves in step with the exchange rate, the importer is willing to accept lower LCP. The intuition is that
the importer can sell the goods at a higher …nal price when a depreciation of her
currency raises the price she pays in her currency for imports. The second driver

In technical terms, xm is similar to a portfolio share in models of endogenous portol…o
choice such as Tille and van Wincoop (2010). Such so-called "zero-order" shares depend not on
the magnitude of volatility (as long as it is positive) but on the co-movements between asset
returns and pricing kernels.

is the comovement between the exporter’s production cost and the exchange rate,
either directly through importer input costs x or indirectly through comovements
1
between wages and the exchange rate, (E w^x s^) (E^
s2 ) . If production costs increase when the importer’s currency weakens, the exporter is less willing to accept
high LCP. The third driver is the impact of exchange rate movements on demand
either through di¤erent degrees of LCP relative to competitors, xm

a¤ects demand through relative prices, or through comovements between the ex1

s2 ) . Such ‡uctuations in demand
change rate and demand shocks, (E q^xm
lead to volatile marginal costs of production, and hence a higher marginal cost on
average, when the production technology is characterized by decreasing returns to
scale ( < 1). This is the "coalescing" motive of invoicing (Goldberg and Tille
2008).
The last two rows in (14) re‡ect how the interactions with partners other than
x and m a¤ect the extent of LCP for the xm pair. These interactions are the ones
between importer m and all exporters (fourth row) and between exporter x and
all importers (…fth row). Intuitively, the deals reached with other counterparts
a¤ect the marginal utility of income of exporter x and importer m and thus the
outcome of their bargaining. This spillover dimension is absent when the valuation
of payo¤s is linear, implying a constant marginal valuation ( X = M = 0).
The overall solution of the model is given by the system (14) for each xm pair.
As each solution involves elements for all exporter-importer pairs in the last two
terms, this makes for a complex system that has no analytical solution in general.
We therefore focus on particular cases designed to highlight the importance of
market structure among exporters and importers. The …rst case highlights the
impact of exporter or importer fragmentation, and the second case considers the
impact of heterogeneity among exporters and among importers.

We illustrate the economic signi…cance of our results for prices and invoice
currency choice through a numerical example. As a baseline speci…cation, we assume an even formal bargaining power, = 0:5, and set both X and M to

2. We set = 2, and assume that production exhibits constant returns to scale
( = 1), and set the cost and price parameters at W = 1, Qset = 10. We parametrize Z = 2W = to ensure that it always exceeds the production cost. For this
baseline case, we assume that input costs are insulated from the exchange rate:

(E w^x s^) (E^

relax some of these restrictive conditions and explore the consequences of changing
the respective assumptions.
The top-left panel of …gure 1 shows the e¤ective bargaining weight, ~xm , relative
to the formal weight , as a function of the numbers of importers M and exporters
X. Importers have a higher e¤ective weight when they are more concentrated than
exporters are, i.e. when M is low or X is high. Most of the impact of bargaining
power takes place are relatively low values of X and M .
The e¤ective bargaining weight of the importer is re‡ected in the steady state
price shown in the top-right panel. Importers who dominate the bargaining are
able to secure a lower price. The bottom-left panel displays the value of individual
set
transactions in the steady state. The exogenous component Qset
xb = Q = (XM )
is equally reduced by a high number of importers or a high number of exporters.
However, when importers are fragmented (M is high and X is low) their bargaining
weight is limited and they are charged a relatively high price. Conversely, they are
charged a low price when fragmentation is on the exporters’side (M is low and X
is high). Therefore, small transactions in real terms have a higher nominal value
when the small size re‡ects importer fragmentation than when it re‡ects exporter
fragmentation.
The extent of LCP xm is presented in the bottom-right panel. It follows
a pattern similar to the steady-state price, with a higher exposure of importers
to exchange rate movements (a lower xm ) when importers have a high e¤ective
bargaining weight. This result can seem puzzling as it seems that importers take
on more exposure to risk when they are more powerful. The reason is that they also
bene…t from low prices and thus get more of the joint surplus from trade contract
negotiations. The marginal utility of importers’ is then small relative to that of
exporters, implying that the importers care relatively little about exchange rate
‡uctuations. Interestingly, a market structure where the extent of LCP xm is high
(M is high and X is low) is also a market structure where the value of transactions
(the price) is high. Therefore, there is a small (7.4%) positive correlation across
17

market structures between transaction value and the extent of LCP.
We now assess the sensitivity of the results to the model parameters. For
brevity we focus on the steady state price and the extent of LCP. Figure 2 shows
the case where the price and extent of LCP are decided only by the exporter, with
the importer’s formal weight being zero. The steady state price is brought all
the way up to the …nal price Z. The exporter reaps all the surplus and is willing
to accept a large exchange rate exposure (a high xm ). Again, the reason for the
willingness to take on a large exposure to exchange rate risk stems from the low
marginal utility on this decision. The degree of fragmentation among importers or
exporters does not impact the price and extent of LCP.
Figure 3 shows that increasing the concavity of payo¤ valuation for all agents
( X = M = 4) makes the pricing and invoicing pattern more sensitive to the
market structure. Intuitively, agents are more sensitive towards failing to reach an
agreement with a counterpart when this failure substantially a¤ects their marginal
utility. If we only increase the concavity of valuation for importers (Figure 4 with
X = 2 and M = 4), the pricing and invoicing are more sensitive to the number
of exporters but not to the number of importers (relative to the baseline case). A
higher concavity of valuation on one side of the market thus magni…es the impact
of fragmentation on the other side.
Increasing the sensitivity of demand to prices (Figure 5 with = 5) lowers
the steady state price and the extent of LCP, and makes both prices and LCP
insensitive to the fragmentation among agents, even though the e¤ective bargaining
share remains similar to the baseline. Importers in industries with a high pricesensitivity of demand bene…t from a low steady state price and are willing to
tolerate a higher exposure to exchange rate ‡uctuations as their marginal utility
of payo¤ is low.
Figure 6 displays the case with decreasing returns to scale ( = 0:75). We see
that this has an impact on the steady state price, which is now higher, but does
not matter much for the extent of LCP which is similar to Figure 1. Intuitively, a
lower value of raises the marginal cost for a given average cost. The right-hand
side of (12) then becomes negative, which requires a higher steady state price.
Finally, we consider that exchange rate movements directly impact the cost of
inputs in Figure 7 ( x = 0:5), so that a depreciation of the exporter’s currency
raises her production costs. While this reliance on imported inputs (or exchange
rate sensitive costs) has little impact on the steady state price, it raises the extent of
18

LCP substantially, and makes the LCP share less sensitive to the market structure.
Intuitively, stabilizing the price in the importer’s currency provides more of a
hedging bene…t to exporters, as a depreciation of their currency then increases
their unit revenue and thus o¤sets the increase in costs.
To sum up, our analysis shows that the extent of fragmentation among importers and exporters impacts the e¤ective bargaining weights, the prices, and the
extent of LCP. Interestingly, a higher bargaining power for importers bene…ts them
through a lower steady state price. This gives them high payo¤s and thus lowers
their marginal utility. This in turns make them more tolerant towards volatility
and leads them to accept a high exposure to exchange rate ‡uctuations.

5.2

Intra-group heterogeneity

We now turn to the role of heterogeneity among exporter and importers. For
simplicity, we assume that there are two exporters, denoted by X1 and X2, and
two importers, denoted by M 1 and M 2. Without loss of generality we consider
that exporter 1 and importer 1 are relatively large. Speci…cally, the steady values
of the Qset
xm terms in (5) are:
Qset
X1M 1 =

Qset

Qset
X2M 1 = (1

;

) Qset

Qset
X1M 2 =

) Qset

(1

Qset
X2M 2 = (1

;

) Qset

) (1

Qset is the total quantity exchange in the steady state. The coe¢ cients 2 [0:5; 1]
and 2 [0:5; 1] denote the sizes of larger exporter and the larger importer, respectively. The case of homogeneity ( = = 0:5) corresponds to the fragmentation
case with X = M = 2.
m
As in the previous example, we begin by specifying the reference price Rxm
in
(5). We treat this reference price as an index of prices set by exporters to importer
m, written as:
m

(17)

where the …rst equality denotes that the reference price is the same for all exporters
selling to a given importer. For simplicity we assume that the …nal price Zm and
the input cost wx are the same for all importers and exporters.
The steady state solution takes the form of the pleasant exercise of solving
14 non-linear equations. The …rst two are the price indexes (17), one for each
19

importer. The next four equations are the shares (10)-(11), then we have four
e¤ective bargaining weights (13), and …nally four pricing equations (12). The
speci…c equations are given in the appendix.
set
,
Turning to the determination of the optimal degree of LCP,we set z^m , q^xm
^x to be the same for all xm pairs for simplicity. A log linear approxx and w
imation of the reference price Rxm around the steady state implies that xm =
) 2m . Using this result, we obtain four variants of the optimum
1m + (1
LCP equation (14), one per importer-exporter pair. The relation for the 1; 2 pair
is presented in the appendix. The solution for the four invoicing shares is given by
inverting a linear system of four equations.
We illustrate our results with a numerical example, taking the same baseline
calibration as for the previous example. Figure 8 shows the e¤ective bargaining
weights relative to the formal weight, ~xm
, as a function of the heterogeneity
among exporters ( ) and importers ( ) for all exporter-importer pairs. The top
left panel considers the large importer’s weight vis-a-vis the large exporter (~X1M 1 ),
and shows that importer bargaining weight increases with importer heterogeneity
(higher ) and decreases with the exporter heterogeneity (higher ).
The bottom left panel shows that the large importer’s bargaining weight vis-avis the small exporter (~X2M 1 ) is high and increases with importer heterogeneity,
especially at high levels of heterogeneity. While it also increases with exporter
heterogeneity, the e¤ect is smaller. A mirror pattern is seen for the e¤ective weight
of the small importer vis-a-vis the large exporter (~X1M 2 , top right panel), which is
relatively insensitive to the importer heterogeneity but falls rapidly as the exporter
heterogeneity increases. Finally, the small importer’s weight vis-a-vis the small
exporter (~X2M 2 , bottom right panel) is close to the formal weight and relatively
insensitive to heterogeneity.
The pattern for the e¤ective bargaining weights is mirrored in the steady state
price (…gure 9). The price is lower for sales to the larger importer (left panels)
than for sales to the small importer (right panels). The gap is more pronounced
when importer fragmentation is high, and for sales from the large exporter (top
panels).
The extent of LCP, xm , is displayed in Figure 10 for the four importer-exporter
pairs. Starting from the point of full homogeneity ( = = 0:5), the extent of
LCP between the large importer and the large exporter (top left panel) falls with
importer heterogeneity, but increases with exporter heterogeneity. This is a similar
20

pattern to the one of the steady state price in Figure 9. When the importer can
shift the surplus her way through a low steady state price, her marginal valuation
of pro…ts is low. The importer then is little a¤ected by exchange rate volatility
and more willing to be exposed to ‡uctuations resulting in low LCP. The similarity
between the steady state price and the extent of LCP is also seen for sales from the
large exporter to the small importer (top right panel). As the small importer carries
less weight than the large one, she receives a higher price, but also a more limited
exposure to exchange rate movements. The large importer also faces a smaller
degree of LCP on sales from the small exporter (bottom left panel) than on sales
from the large exporter (top left panel), re‡ecting the fact that she obtains a lower
price on purchases from the smaller exporter. The extent of LCP between the small
importer and small exporter (bottom right panel) increases with heterogeneity, but
that pair has a limited impact on the aggregate pattern with high heterogeneity.
To obtain summary measures of the pricing and invoicing, we compute the average and standard deviation of the steady state price and extent of LCP across the
four exporter-importer pairs, weighting each pair by its share in total steady state
transaction value. The results are presented in Figure 11. Exporter heterogeneity
raises the average price of traded goods (top left panel). While the cross-sectional
dispersion of prices (top right panel) is raised by heterogeneity of either exporters
or importers, the dispersion is increased more by exporter heterogeneity. The
extent of heterogeneity has a substantial impact on the average degree of LCP
(bottom left panel) which increases with exporter heterogeneity. Heterogeneity on
either side of the market raises the dispersion of LCP shares.
As the market structure impacts the steady state price, and hence the steady
state value of transactions, as well as the extent of LCP, we consider the linkage between the two by computing the coe¢ cient of correlation across the four
exporter-importer pairs between the steady state value of transactions and the extents of LCP (Figure 12). This correlation is negative when importer heterogeneity
dominates, but turns positive as exporter heterogeneity raises.
Our numerical example shows that the market structure has a sizable impact
on the e¤ective bargaining weight, price, and extent of LCP across the various
importer-exporter pairs. This impact is also observed in aggregate terms, as the
average value and dispersion of prices and extents of LCP, as well as the correlation between invoicing and transaction size, vary depending on the degrees of
heterogeneity among importers and exporters.
21

We now consider the impact of varying the model parameters along the same
lines as in the previous example. For brevity, we focus on the averages and standard
deviations of steady state prices and the extent of LCP, as well as the correlation
between transaction value and invoicing. In the case of unilateral decisions by the
exporters ( = 0, not reported for brevity), the steady state price goes to the …nal
price and the exporter takes most of the exchange rate risk, as in the previous
example. The pricing and invoicing pattern is not a¤ected by heterogeneity on
either side of the market.
Increasing the concavity of payo¤ valuation ( X = M = 4) raises the average
extent of LCP somewhat (Figure 13 bottom left panel) and increases the dispersion
of prices and extent of LCP (right panels). The average value of prices and invoicing
remains sensitive to the amount of heterogeneity on both sides of the market. The
correlation between transaction value and invoicing remains close to the baseline
case (Figure 14). If payo¤s are more concave only for importers ( X = 2 and
M = 4), the average price and extent of LCP are further increased (Figure 15 left
panels).
Increasing the sensitivity of demand to prices ( = 5) substantially lower the
average price and the average extent of LCP, as importers’marginal utility is then
less sensitive to prices (Figure 17 left panels). The average price and invoicing is
also much less sensitive to the market structure. In addition, the cross sectional
dispersion of the two measures is reduced (right panels), and shifts the correlation
between transaction value and extent of LCP towards positive values (Figure 18).
Introducing decreasing returns to scale ( = 0:75) raises the average price and
reduces the extent of LCP (Figure 19 left panels) and leads to more dispersion
in prices (top right panel). The dispersion in invoicing is now mostly driven by
importer heterogeneity. The market structure has a sizable impact on the average
price, and a more moderate one on the average extent of LCP. The correlation
between transaction value and extent of LCP shifts towards negative values (Figure 20). We …nally consider a direct impact of the exchange rate on input costs
x = 0:5). This has little impact on prices (Figure 21 top panel) and raises the
average extent of LCP (bottom left panel) while lowering its dispersion somewhat.
The sensitivity of the average price and invoicing to the market structure remains
similar to the baseline case. The correlation between transaction value and invoicing remains close to the baseline case (Figure 22).

5.3

Implications from the model

While our two speci…c examples focus on di¤erent dimensions of the model,
our analysis provides broad lessons that are relevant for understanding pricing and
invoicing patterns in international trade. These lessons arise when bargaining can
occur between exporters and importers.
First, the analysis should encompass all the dimensions of the contract that
are a¤ected by bargaining. One may expect at …rst that a higher bargaining
power of risk-averse importers would lead them to reduce their exchange rate
exposure through higher LCP. Our analysis shows that the opposite is the case,
as the higher bargaining weight is re‡ected in a steady state price more favorable
to importers, which in turn reduces the marginal impact of exchange rate risk
on importers payo¤s and leads them to accept more exchange rate exposure. A
di¤erent pattern would emerge if the bargaining took place only over the extent of
LCP, with the preset price set unilaterally by the exporter, in which case a higher
bargaining power of importers would raise the extent of LCP. These …ndings point
to the need for more research targeted at understanding the speci…c structures of
negotiations that occur between exporters and importers.
Second, the speci…c market structure matters not only at the level of individual
transactions but also in aggregate terms, as shown by our second example. This
insight points to the need for empirical studies of exchange rate exposure to understand the market structure at the micro level, even when the focus is on the
aggregate extent of LCP.
Third, our examples show that the extent of LCP is higher in situations where
exporters are more dominant, either because they are less fragmented (a low X
relative to M in the …rst example), or because their side of the market is dominated
by a few agents (a high relative to in the second example).
Fourth, the sensitivity of pricing and invoicing to market characteristics is magni…ed when agents are more sensitive to risk, dampened in industries where demand is more price-sensitive, and increased when exchange rate movements a¤ect
exporters’costs.
Finally, the correlation between the value of speci…c transactions and their
reliance on LCP depends on the market structure. The correlation is positive
when large transactions re‡ect large exporters, but negative when they re‡ect
large importers.

Conclusion

This paper analyzes the determination of prices and exposure to exchange rate
‡uctuations among exporters and importers through a simple model of bargaining.
This setting expands the theoretical analysis beyond the standard assumption of
unilateral choice by the exporter. We show that the market structure, re‡ecting
in the share of speci…c exporters and importers in each other’s total pro…ts, has a
substantial impact on e¤ective bargaining weights, prices, and exchange rate exposure. This impact is not limited to speci…c exporter-importer pairs but also a¤ects
the aggregate values of prices and exposure. A striking result of our analysis is that
powerful agents end up being more exposed to exchange rate ‡uctuations. This
re‡ects the fact that their power allows them to shift the steady state price in their
favor, which lowers their marginal utility and makes exchange rate ‡uctuations less
of a concern.
Our analysis is the …rst step towards building a bargaining view in the theory
of international trade pricing under uncertainty. Under this view understanding
aggregate prices requires one to take account of the microeconomic structure of
the market, such as the degrees of fragmentation and heterogeneity among exporters and importers. A promising area of future research is to go beyond our
Nash bargaining solution and get more detailed evidence on the speci…c process of
interaction between importers and exporters in speci…c industries.
Another avenue for further work is to allow for prices to respond ex-post to
cost movements. It is reasonable to expect that this response will be substantially
a¤ected by the market structure. Recall that the importer’s currency is used for
the invoicing when the importer’s weight is low, as she is then faced with a high
preset price, hence low pro…ts and a high marginal valuation of pro…ts. In line
with the …nding of Gopinath, Itskhoki, and Rigobon (2010) that price adjustment
is low for U.S. imports invoiced in dollars, a reasonable conjecture is that in such a
situation the high marginal utility would also leads to limited movements of prices
when they can be adjusted.

Quadratic approximation

To write a quadratic approximation of (9), we …rst notice that left- and righthand sides are expressions of the form (the detailed expression for (9) is given in
a long technical appendix):

Bearing in mind that we expand around s = 0 and that E^
s = 0, we write:

As all the pre-set component of all prices deviate from the steady-state allocation
only because of second moments, we can omit the various pf and rj;f from the
quadratic elements. We also recall that a
^xm = 0 as Axm is constant. The quadratic
