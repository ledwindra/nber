Impact of "Seguro Popular" on Prenatal Visits in Mexico, 2002-2005: Latent Class Model

ABSTRACT
We employ a latent class model to assess the impact of Mexico’s Seguro Popular ("SP") program on
the number of prenatal visits in a cross-sectional sample of 4,381 women who gave birth during 2002-2005.
We specify an ordered probit model to permit a pregnant woman’s probability of membership in one
of three latent classes to depend on observed covariates. In the ordered probit model, enrollment in
SP is explicitly treated as an endogenous variable. We model the number of prenatal visits, conditional
upon membership in a particular latent class, as a Poisson regression. We employ the EM algorithm
to reduce the computational burden of model estimation. At any iteration of the algorithm, the parameters
of the model of latent class membership can be estimated separately from the parameters of the model
of prenatal care utilization. We find that enrollment in SP was associated with a mean increase in
1.65 prenatal visits during pregnancy. Approximately 59 percent of this treatment effect is the result
of increased prenatal care among women in the first latent class, that is, women who had with little
or no access to care. The remaining 41 percent of the treatment effect is the result of a shift in membership
from the second to the third latent class, which we interpret as increased recognition of complications
of pregnancy prior to labor and delivery. Our model has a better fit and predicts a larger impact of
SP than alternative models that relax the assumption of endogeneity, do not impose ordering on the
latent classes, or incorporate only two latent classes. Our findings are consistent with prior work on
the favorable impact of SP on maternal health (Sosa-Rubí, Galárraga, Harris 2009).

1. INTRODUCTION
Since the seminal paper of Deb and Trivedi (Deb and Trivedi 1997), latent class
models have become increasingly common in the econometric analysis of the demand for
health care. In these models, the econometrician assumes that each individual belongs to
one of a fixed number of latent classes, but the specific class to which an individual
belongs remains unobserved. Based on these assumptions, she jointly estimates the
probability of membership in each class, as well as the demand for health care
conditional upon membership in each specific class (Atella, Brindisi et al. 2004; Deb,
Munkin et al. 2006). In most applications, investigators have assumed that the unknown
probabilities of class membership are fixed parameters. In a few papers, analysts have
modeled these probabilities as functions of observed covariates (Nagin and Land 1993;
Roeder, Lynch et al. 1999; Greene and Hensher 2003; Clark, Elité et al. 2005; Bago
d'Uva 2006; Clark and Etile 2006; Bago d'Uva and Jones 2008; Greene, Harris et al.
2008).
Latent class models have made significant progress in addressing the
heterogeneous effects of health-sector policies, such as those policies aimed at improving
access to medical care (Deb and Trivedi 1997; Deb and Holmes 2000; Jimenez-Martin,
Labeaga et al. 2002; Conway and Deb 2005). These models have demonstrated how such
unobserved or partially observed factors as health status and attitudes toward health risks
can determine consumers’ demand responses. However, such models have not squarely
confronted the serious problem that health-care coverage is endogenous in nonexperimental databases (Cameron, Trivedi et al. 1988; Atella and Deb 2008). Even in
contexts where the government exogenously introduces a change in eligibility criteria or

Harris & Sosa-Rubí

insurance coverage for specific types of health care, the individual’s decision to take
advantage of the new policy may still be voluntary (Sosa-Rubí, Galárraga et al. 2009).
As a consequence, unobserved factors may influence both the decision to participate and
the demand for medical care conditional upon participation (Cameron, Trivedi et al.
1988).
Here, we extend the latent class framework to take account of this knotty problem
of endogeneity. We assume, as have other investigators, that the probability of latent
class membership is a function of observable covariates. Unlike prior work, we permit
one of these covariates to be endogenous to the model of latent class determination. We
show how the EM algorithm, an iterative procedure that has been widely used to estimate
latent class models, can be extended to our model. At each stage of the iterative EM
algorithm, we separately estimate two distinct subsets of parameters: the parameters of
the model of latent class membership, which contains the endogenous variable; and the
parameters of the model of demand conditional on class membership.
We apply our approach to an evaluation of the impact of Seguro Popular (or
“People’s Insurance”), a public health policy inaugurated in Mexico in 2001 to improve
access of the poor to quality medical care (Gakidou, Lozano et al. 2006; King, Gakidou et
al. 2009; Sosa-Rubí, Galárraga et al. 2009). We study the effect of a household’s
participation in Seguro Popular (“SP”) on the demand for prenatal care by pregnant
women who delivered babies during 2002–2005. Analyzing cross-sectional data from the
2006 National Survey of Health and Nutrition (Encuesta Nacional de Salud y Nutrición,
or “ENSANUT”) (Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública 2006), we specify a Poisson countdata model for the number of prenatal visits, conditional upon membership in one of

Harris & Sosa-Rubí

May 18, 2009

Page 5

three latent classes. We further specify an ordered probit model for the determination of
class membership. The household’s participation in SP enters as a covariate not only in
the former Poisson model, but also as an endogenous covariate in the latter ordered probit
model. Consequently, enrollment in Seguro Popular can influence the distribution of
class membership as well the conditional demand for prenatal care. Our specification has
significantly better fit to our data than alternative restricted models that specify only two
latent classes, do not account for the endogeneity of SP, or do not model class
membership. Moreover, our model predicts significantly larger impacts of SP – as well
as public policies designed to promote participation in SP – than alternative models.
Based upon our findings, we interpret the three latent classes of pregnant women
in Mexico as representing: (1) poor women without access to prenatal health care
services; (2) women with access to prenatal care but without identified complications of
pregnancy; and (3) women with access to prenatal care and identified pregnancy
complications. Our empirical finding that SP moves pregnant women from the first to
the second class suggests that SP has improved access among women who previously had
little no prenatal care. Moreover, our finding that SP moves some women from the
second to the third class suggests that SP has permitted identification of pregnancy
complications might have otherwise gone unrecognized before labor.

2. ECONOMETRIC MODELS
2.1. General Latent Class Model
Our cross-sectional sample consists of independent observations on M pregnant
woman, indexed i = 1,…, M . For each pregnant woman, we observe the number ni of
prenatal visits, as well as other covariates to be described below.
We assume that each woman belongs to one of three latent classes, indexed by

k = 1, 2, 3 , but we cannot observe the class to which she belongs. Extension of our
analysis to an arbitrary number of classes is straightforward. We denote by fk ( ni ; Xi , β )
the conditional distribution of the number of prenatal visits ni , given that woman i
belongs to class k , where is a vector Xi of observed covariates and β is an unknown
parameter vector. We shall specify a parametric form for this distribution shortly.
Let π k ( Zi ,θ ) denote the probability that pregnant woman i belongs to class k ,
where Zi is a vector of observed covariates that may differ from Xi , and where θ is an
3

unknown parameter vector. These probabilities are constrained so that

∑ π ( Z ,θ ) = 1
k =1

k

i

for all i = 1,…, M . Below, we specify parametric forms for the dependence of the latent
class probabilities π k on observed covariates.
2.2. Estimation via the EM Algorithm
The foregoing assumptions imply a mixture of count-data models. The log
likelihood is
(1)

⎡ 3
⎤
L ( n, X, Z β ,θ ) = ∑ ln ⎢ ∑ π k ( Zi ,θ ) fk ( n; Xi , β ) ⎥
⎣ k =1
⎦
i =1

Harris & Sosa-Rubí

The log likelihood function in (1) is not separable in the parameters β and θ . However,
the EM algorithm offers an iterative approach to maximization of (1) that permits us to
estimate the parameters β and θ separately during each successive iteration. The EM
algorithm has been widely employed to maximize the log likelihood function in latent
class models (Wedel, Desarbo et al. 1993).
We applied the EM algorithm to the maximization of the log likelihood in (1) as

(

)

follows. Assume that we have estimates β (t ) ,θ (t ) at iteration t = 1, 2,… of the
algorithm. We update these parameter estimates in two steps: the E-step and the M-step.
In the E-step, we evaluate the posterior probability that woman i belongs to class k as
(t )

Equation (2) is a version of Bayes formula, in which the prior probabilities are

(

(

π k Zi ,θ (t ) and the likelihoods are fk ni ; Xi , β (t ) . We then define the log likelihood of
the extended data (sometimes called the “complete-data log likelihood”), consisting of
the observed data {ni , Xi , Zi } as well as the class variable { ki } for each woman
i = 1,…, M , as if each woman’s latent class were known:

(

Given the estimates β (t ) ,θ (t ) at iteration t , the expected value of this extended log
likelihood is

where the expectation is taken over the posterior distribution given in (2). In the M-step,
we maximize this expression with respect to ( β ,θ ) in order to obtain updated values of

(

)

the parameters β (t +1) ,θ (t +1) . A critical feature of the maximization problem in this M-

(

)

step is that the expectation Q β ,θ , β (t ) ,θ (t ) of the extended log likelihood in (4) is
separable in the parameters β and θ . It is well known that the EM procedure converges
to the maximum of the likelihood function (1) (Redner and Walker 1984) (Xu and Jordan
1996).
2.3. Poisson Conditional Distributions
In what follows, we assume that the conditional distribution of prenatal visits ni ,
given that pregnant woman i belongs to latent class k is Poisson:
(5)

λikn exp ( − λik )
fk ( ni ; Xi , β ) =
, where λik = exp ( Xi′β k ) , for k = 1, 2, 3
n!

and where β = ( β1 , β 2 , β 3 ) . Although we shall not do so here, we could generalize our
analysis to any conditional distribution for the count variable ni , such as the negative
binomial (Deb and Trivedi 1997).
Given the Poisson conditional distributions in (5), the expected log likelihood (4)
in the M-step simplifies to

The maximizing solution for each β k is obtained by setting the corresponding derivatives

(

of Q β ,θ , β (t ) ,θ (t ) with respect to each β k equal to zero. That is,

− exp ( Xi′β k )) = 0 for k = 1, 2, 3

where (7) is a vector equation that holds for each coordinate of Xi . This is equivalent to
separately solving three weighted Poisson regressions, where the weights for regression
k are the posterior probabilities pik(t ) . This procedure for obtaining the updated

parameters β (t +1) at iteration t + 1 does not depend on the specification of our model for
the probabilities π k ( Zi ,θ ) , to which we now turn.
2.4. Basic Model: Mixture of Poisson Distributions
We develop our models for π k ( Zi ,θ ) in stages. We begin with the conventional
mixture model, where the probability of belonging to each latent class is a fixed
parameter that does not depend on observables.
(8)

π k ( Zi ,θ ) = θ k for k = 1, 2, 3

This is the model underlying nearly all of the latent class literature. Given (5), our model
is a finite mixture of Poisson distributions. The expected log likelihood in the M-step
simplifies to

2.5. Ordered Probit Model for the Mixing Probabilities
We modify our basic model so that the probabilities π k are functions of the
observable variables Zi . Specifically, for all i = 1,…, M ,

(11)

ki * = Z i′α + ε i , where ε i ~ i.i.d. N ( 0,1)

⎧ 1 if ki * ≤ 0
⎪
and ki = ⎨ 2 if κ ≥ ki * > 0
⎪ 3 if k * > κ
i
⎩

Equation (11) is an ordered probit model, where α and κ are unknown parameters. We
assume that the unit normal error term ε i is independent of the covariates Zi . Denoting

θ = (α ,κ ) , and letting Φ (⋅) represent the unit normal cumulative distribution function,
we have:
(12)

π 1 ( Zi ,θ ) = Φ ( − Zi′α )

π 2 ( Zi ,θ ) = Φ (κ − Zi′α ) − Φ ( − Zi′α )
π 3 ( Zi ,θ ) = Φ ( Zi′α − κ )

(

)

Maximization of the expected log likelihood Q β ,θ , β (t ) ,θ (t ) in (6) with respect to the
parameters θ = (α ,κ ) at the M-step is similarly obtained by setting the corresponding
derivatives equal to zero. Letting ϕ (⋅) denote the unit normal density function, we have

2.5. Ordered Probit with a Binary Endogenous Variable
We further modify our ordered probit model, introducing an observed binary
endogenous variable yi . Specifically, for all i = 1,…, M ,

ki * = Z i′α + δ yi + ε i

⎧ 1 if ki * ≤ 0
⎪
where ki = ⎨ 2 if κ ≥ ki * > 0

(14)

yi * ≤ 0
yi * > 0

Equation (14), which determines latent class membership, is an ordered probit model that
now depends on a variable yi in addition to the observables Zi . Equation (15) specifies a
probit model in which the binary variable yi depends on a separate vector Wi of
observable covariates, which may differ from Xi and Zi . We assume that the error terms

ε i and ν i in (16) are independent of the covariates Zi and Wi . If the correlation
coefficient ρ in (16) is non-zero, then the variable yi is endogenous.
Let θ = (α , δ ,κ , γ , ρ ) and si = 2yi − 1 . Let Φ 2 (⋅, ⋅, ρ ) denote the unit bivariate
normal cumulative distribution function with correlation coefficient ρ . We have:
(17)

π 1 ( Zi ,Wi , yi ,θ ) =

π 2 ( Zi ,Wi , yi ,θ ) =

In (17), each expression π k ( Zi ,Wi , yi ,θ ) represents the corresponding probability that
pregnant woman i belongs to latent class k given the observed values of Zi , Wi and yi .

These latent class probabilities likewise satisfy

where the additional term on the right-hand side corresponds to the likelihood
contribution of the probit model for yi in (15). Once again, the EM algorithm can be
employed to maximize the log likelihood in (18). Suppose that we have parameter

compute the posterior probability that woman i belongs to class k as

Maximization with respect to the parameters β = ( β1 , β 2 , β 3 ) and θ = (α , δ ,κ , γ , ρ ) is
similarly obtained by setting the corresponding derivatives of (19) equal to zero. Note
that (20) remains separable in β and θ , so that the first-order conditions for β in (7) still
apply. Moreover, parameter γ , which appears only in the last term of (20), need not be
estimated iteratively.
2.6. Testing Alternative Models
With one exception to be described below, our alternative models of the number
of prenatal visits are successively nested. Thus, the basic model with fixed mixing
probabilities (8) is nested within the ordered probit model of mixing probabilities (12).
The former model is equivalent to the latter under the restriction that θ = 0 . Likewise,
the model (12) is nested within the ordered probit model of mixing probabilities with an
endogenous variable (17). The former is equivalent to the latter under the restriction that

ρ = 0 . Thus, the standard likelihood ratio tests can be employed to distinguish between
models.
We can extend the nesting concept to other alternative models not explicitly
considered above. Consider the model (17) with only two latent classes, rather than
three. This would correspond to a simple probit model of mixing probabilities with an
endogenous variable. Such a model would likewise be nested within the model (17), and
would be equivalent to the restriction that κ = 0 . Alternatively, consider a simple countdata model in which the number of prenatal visits ni is Poisson distributed with mean

λ1 = exp ( X1′ β1 ) . This model is nested within the basic latent class model with fixed
probabilities (8), with the restriction θ 2 = θ 3 = 0 .

Prior contributions to the latent class literature have considered a multinomial
logit specification for the mixing probabilities π k ( Zi ,θ ) (Nagin and Land 1993; Roeder,
Lynch et al. 1999; Clark, Elité et al. 2005; Bago d'Uva and Jones 2008). In that case,
equation (12) is replaced by
(21)

π k ( Z i ,θ ) =

∑ exp ( Z ′α )

j =1

for k = 1, 2, 3

j

where θ = (α1 , α 2 , α 3 ) . This model, which can also be estimated by the EM algorithm, is
not nested within our ordered probit models. In our empirical analysis, we employed the
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (Aikake 1974) and the Bayesian Information
Criterion (BIC) (Schwarz 1978) to compare (21) with our alternative models. The former
criterion corresponds to 2N − 2L * , where L * is the maximized value of the log
likelihood function L in (2) or L in (18) and N is the total number of parameters in

( β ,θ ) .

The latter criterion corresponds to N ln M − 2L * , where M , as noted above, is

the sample size.
2.7. Computation of Treatment Effects
In our empirical work, we focus on two treatment effects: (1) the direct effect of
Seguro Popular; and (2) the indirect effect of public policies intended to increase
participation in Seguro Popular. In the terminology of (Heckman and Vytlacil 2007), the
former corresponds to the “treatment effect on the treated,” while the latter represents the
“policy relevant treatment effect,” where a public policy that may alter the probability of
treatment. In both cases, the endpoint is the predicted number of prenatal visits in our
sample population.

Harris & Sosa-Rubí

May 18, 2009

Page 15

To that end, we explicitly identify Seguro Popular with the binary endogenous
variable yi . We permit yi to be a covariate the model of the conditional distribution of
the number of prenatal visits ni , given that pregnant woman i belongs to latent class k .
Thus, equation (5) is generalized to:
(22)

λikn exp ( − λik )
fk ( ni ; Xi , β ) =
, where λik = exp ( Xi′β k + ζ k yi ) , for k = 1, 2, 3
n!

and where β = ( β1 , β 2 , β 3 ,ζ1 ,ζ 2 ,ζ 3 ) . The explicit inclusion of yi in (22) does not alter the
fact that the expected log likelihood function is separable in the parameters β and θ .
Let E ⎡⎣ ni y ⎤⎦ denote the mean number of prenatal visits of pregnant woman i ,
conditional upon the presence or absence of Seguro Popular, that is, conditional upon y .
For each k = 1, 2, 3 , we abbreviate λik ( y ) = exp ( Xi′β k + ζ k y ) and π ik ( y ) = π k ( Zi ,Wi , y,θ ) ,
where π k (

)

3

is defined in (17). Then E ⎡⎣ ni y ⎤⎦ = ∑ π ik ( y ) λik ( y ) . The direct effect of
k =1

Seguro Popular (that is, the effect of a change in y from 0 to 1) on the mean number of
prenatal visits of pregnant woman i is:
3

(23)

ΔE [ ni ] = E ⎡⎣ ni 1⎤⎦ − E ⎡⎣ ni 0 ⎤⎦ = ∑ (π ik (1) λik (1) − π ik ( 0 ) λik ( 0 ))
k =1

which can be decomposed into:
(24)

3

3

k =1

k =1

ΔE [ ni ] = ∑ π ik (1) ( λik (1) − λik ( 0 )) + ∑ (π ik (1) − π ik ( 0 )) λik ( 0 )

The first summation captures the effect of Seguro Popular on the mean number of visits
within each latent class, while the second term captures the effect of Seguro Popular on

Harris & Sosa-Rubí

(

)

the probabilities of latent class membership. Noting that λik (1) = exp (ζ k ) − 1 λik ( 0 ) for

k = 1, 2, 3 , we can derive a computationally simpler form for (24) as:
3

(25)

ΔE [ ni ] = ∑ λik ( 0 ) ⎡⎣π ik (1) exp (ζ k ) − π ik ( 0 ) ⎤⎦
k =1

We calculate the population mean and median values of ΔE [ ni ] .
We next compute the indirect effect of a change in a policy variable intended to
increase participation in Seguro Popular. For this purpose, we focus on a specific
continuous covariate wh that is a component of the vector W but not a component of the
vectors X or Z . We define:

3. BACKGROUND AND DATA
3.1. Seguro Popular and Prenatal Health Services in Mexico
Beginning in the mid-1990s, Mexico introduced a series of public policies
designed to improve the health of its poorest and most vulnerable populations: the
Program to Expand Coverage (“Programa de Ampliación de Cobertura”) in 1995,
Oportunidades (initially named “PROGRESA”) in 1997, and the Fair Start in Life
program (“Arranque Parejo en la Vida”) in 2001 (Frenk, Gonzalez-Pier et al. 2006).
There is evidence that these programs improved access to health care and health
outcomes, particularly in the area of maternal and reproductive health. Evaluations of
Oportunidades, in particular, have demonstrated an increase in prenatal visits among
pregnant women beneficiaries (Gertler 2000).
Despite these initiatives, half of Mexico’s population remained uninsured at the
start of 2001. At that time, a pregnant woman faced essentially three choices for her
prenatal and obstetric care. First, if a family member were employed in a specific sector
of the formal economy, such as petroleum (PEMEX), she could take advantage of the
prevailing system of social security (“Seguridad Social”), which offered a modern
network of high-quality primary and secondary maternal health care services, mostly in

Harris & Sosa-Rubí

May 18, 2009

Page 18

urban areas. Second, if she were ineligible for social security but eligible for a state-run
program, she could seek prenatal and obstetric care at government-sponsored facilities,
including those of the Department of Health (“Secretaría de Salud”). Such facilities were
often poorly staffed and widely regarded as having variable quality. Third, she could
seek medical care in the private sector, paying out of pocket. While many urban women
with adequate incomes paid a private obstetrician, poorer women and those in rural areas
frequently sought low-priced care from informal providers, including midwives and
traditional healers. Some of these women had no prenatal care prior to labor and
delivery.
Seguro Popular (“People’s Insurance”) was introduced in 2001 with a two-fold
purpose: to provide insurance coverage to the nation’s most vulnerable populations; and
to increase the quality of health care services provided in the public sector (Gakidou,
Lozano et al. 2006; King, Gakidou et al. 2009; Sosa-Rubí, Galárraga et al. 2009).
Initially launched as a pilot project in five states and gradually rolled out in the rest of the
country, Seguro Popular had been incorporated by 2005 into all of Mexico’s 32 states.
On the demand side, SP served as a voluntary insurance program for uninsured
households, with well-defined eligibility rules, benefit packages and premiums scaled to
income. The eligibility rules favored the poorest households in rural areas, including
those who were also eligible for the Oportunidades program, and precluded households
with access to insurance through the system of social security. On the supply side, the
federal government allocated funds to state health departments to upgrade public health
care facilities to meet minimum quality standards. Federal transfers to states were

Harris & Sosa-Rubí

May 18, 2009

Page 19

directly related to the number of SP-enrolled households, so that the states had an
incentive to enroll households in the program.
In a prior study of survey-based observational data, we found that Seguro Popular
enhanced access of pregnant women to obstetrical care for labor and delivery (Sosa-Rubí,
et al 2009). Another observational study has found that SP enhanced access to treatment
for hypertension in those areas with adequate physician supply (Bleich, Cutler et al.
2007). A recent experimental study, in which randomization was performed at the level
of the locality, demonstrated reductions in out-of-pocket “catastrophic” health spending,
but no significant effects on utilization, medication spending, or health outcomes (King,
Gakidou et al. 2009). The latter negative findings may have been due to the relatively
short, 10-month duration of the experimental intervention (Victora and Peters 2009).
3.2. The 2006 ENSANUT Survey Data
We analyzed data from the 2006 National Health and Nutrition Survey (Encuesta
Nacional de Salud y Nutrición, or “ENSANUT”), a nationally representative crosssection survey of 48,304 households containing 206,700 individuals, conducted in all 32
states of Mexico during November 2005 – May 2006 (Instituto Nacional de Salud
Pública 2006). We complemented the survey responses with data on the characteristics
of the localities in which respondents lived, as derived from 2005 census data (Instituto
Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (INEGI) 2005). We focused on a sample of 4,381
females aged 14–49 years, who reported giving birth during 2002–2005, and who
provided responses concerning the number of prenatal visits as well as the explanatory
variables to be delineated below.

Harris & Sosa-Rubí

May 18, 2009

Page 20

Table 1 shows the summary statistics for all variables used in our econometric
analyses. We have classified the explanatory variables into individual, household and
locality characteristics. At the individual level, we included variables reflecting the
woman’s age, educational attainment, language spoken, work status, reproductive history,
and past history of conditions that commonly complicate pregnancy. To address possibly
nonlinearity in the relationship between age and prenatal care, we included age squared
as an explanatory variable (not shown in Table 1). We classified educational attainment
into three levels: primary school or no education; second school; and high school or
greater. The first level served as the reference category. Although we could not ascertain
the respondent’s work status during her pregnancy, nonetheless we included an
explanatory variable reflecting the respondent’s work status during the two weeks prior to
the ENSANUT survey.
At the household level, we included variables reflecting the presence of young
children, an index of household wealth, and indicator variables for household enrolment
in Oportunidades, Seguro Popular, or Seguridad Social (social security). The asset index,
in particular, was based upon household infrastructure, building materials, and ownership
of certain durable assets, such as a refrigerator, television, telephone, oven and stove
(McKenzie 2004).
At the locality level, we included variables reflecting rural location and level of
social deprivation. The latter indicator, also known as the locality’s index of
socioeconomic marginality (“índice de marginación”) is based on such factors as the rate
of illiteracy, the proportions of dwellings with a dirt floor, with overcrowding, without

Harris & Sosa-Rubí

May 18, 2009

Page 21

running water, sewer drainage, or electricity, and the proportion of the population under
the poverty (CONAPO 2005).
We also included a locality-level variable for the percentage penetration of
Seguro Popular among the eligible population (Instituto Nacional de Estadística y
Geografía (INEGI) 2005). SP penetration depended in large part on the investments
made by each state to upgrade the infrastructure and staffing of local health care facilities
in compliance with federal requirements. Local penetration also depended on individual
states’ efforts to inform households of their eligibility and recruit them into the program.
We therefore treated local SP penetration as an exogenous instrumental variable that
influenced the probability that a pregnant woman would enroll in Seguro Popular, but did
not affect her probability membership in a particular latent class or her utilization of
prenatal care conditional on class membership. Thus, local SP penetration appeared as an
exogenous variable in the vector Wi of covariates in equation (15) but not in the vector

Zi of covariates in equation (14) or the vector Xi of covariates in equation (5).
Other investigators have used similar individual-, household- and local-level
covariates to explain prenatal care utilization in developing countries (Wong, Popkin et
al. 1987; Pebley, Goldman et al. 1996; Celik and Hotchkiss 2000; Magadi, Madise et al.
2000; Chen, Liu et al. 2003; Sepehri, Sarma et al. 2008).
4. RESULTS
4.1. Principal Estimation Results
Table II shows the estimates derived from our principal specification, as given in
equations (5) and (14)–(16). The first two columns of estimates show the results of the

Harris & Sosa-Rubí

May 18, 2009

Page 22

model of latent class determination, where the column entitled “Ordered Probit” refers to
equation (14) and the column entitled “Probit SP Enrollment” refers to equation (15). At
the bottom of the first column, the parameter κ refers to the threshold parameter in the
ordered probit equation (14), while the parameter ρ refers to the correlation coefficient
of the error terms in equation (16). The last three columns of Table II show the
parameters of the three conditional Poisson models of prenatal care utilization, as
specified in equation (5).
At the bottom of each of the last three columns of Table II, we report the
estimated population mean values of the probabilities π k ( Zi ,Wi , yi ,θ ) for k = 1, 2, 3 , as
defined in equation (17), as well as the estimated population mean values of the rate
parameters λik = exp ( Xi′β k ) for k = 1, 2, 3 , as defined in equation (5). Thus, the average
probability of belonging to the first latent class was π 1 = 0.0514 , while members of that
class had a mean of 0.5242 visits. The average probability of belonging to the second
class was π 2 = 0.8814 , where the mean was 7.3302 visits. The average probability of
belonging to the third class was π 3 = 0.0672 , where the mean was 16.8447 visits. We
interpret the first latent class as representing those pregnant women with little or no
access to prenatal care, who made very few visits, if any. The second latent class
represents the large majority of pregnant women, who on average sought care about once
every five weeks during a 40-week pregnancy. Finally, we interpret the third latent class
as representing those women with complications of pregnancy that were recognized prior
to labor, and thus required an average of one prenatal visit every 2.4 weeks.
In the ordered probit specification in equation (14), a positive value of the
parameter δ implies that an increase in the endogenous variable yi will shift the

Harris & Sosa-Rubí

May 18, 2009

Page 23

distribution of latent class variables to the right. That is, an increase in yi will tend to
move pregnant woman i from latent class k = 1 to latent class k = 2 , and from class
k = 2 to class k = 3 . Under our interpretation of the three latent classes, the rightward

shift from the first class to the second represents an improvement in access to prenatal
care. The rightward shift from the second to the third class represents the recognition of
preexisting complications of pregnancy prior to labor and delivery. In the first column of
Table II, the endogenous variable Seguro Popular in fact had a significant positive
coefficient.
A positive value of a particular component of the parameter vector α , as
specified in equation (14), similarly implies that an increase the corresponding
component of Zi will shift the distribution of latent class variables to the right. Among
the observed covariates with a significant positive coefficient in the same column were:
educational attainment, household wealth, enrollment in the Oportunidades program, and
a history of prior health conditions (diabetes, hypertension, urinary tract infections) that
could complicate pregnancy. The negative coefficient for the number of pregnancy
losses suggests that this variable serves as a proxy for reduced access to care in prior
pregnancies rather than as an indicator of current pregnancy risk.
In Table II, the estimated correlation coefficient of the error terms in the model of
latent class determination (that is, ρ , as specified in equation 16) is –0.22, and the
estimate is significantly different from zero ( P = 0.025 ) . Put differently, those
unobserved factors that increase participation in SP are correlated with those unobserved
factors that prevent women from recognizing complications prior to labor (latent class 3)
and relegate them to the low-access group (latent class 1). The finding of a negative

Harris & Sosa-Rubí

May 18, 2009

Page 24

correlation coefficient is consistent with our prior work on Seguro Popular (Sosa-Rubí,
Galárraga et al. 2009). A negative correlation coefficient has been seen in other
observational studies in developing countries (Waters 1999), although the evidence
overall remains mixed (Harmon and Nolan 2001; Trujillo 2003; Jowett, Deolalikar et al.
2004).
In the second column of estimates in Table II, we find that indicators of lower
educational attainment, lower family wealth, and participation in the Oportunidades
program are predictors of participation in Seguro Popular. We dropped Seguridad Social
from the covariates in this equation, since it was perfectly correlated with
nonparticipation in SP, inasmuch as women enrolled in Seguridad Social are ineligible
for SP. Finally, the percentage penetration of SP in the local area is a strong predictor of
individual participation. This finding supports the validity of local SP penetration as an
instrumental variable.
In the group of columns in Table II under the heading “Poisson Models of
Prenatal Visits,” the estimates for latent class 1 reveal significant positive coefficients for
age, high school education, number of prior pregnancy losses, and the index of household
wealth. Living in a rural locality or in a locality with a high index of social deprivation
reduces the number of prenatal visits within in this group. Enrollment in Seguro Popular
markedly increases the number of visits within this latent class. Being a beneficiary of
social security (Seguridad Social) or the Oportunidades program also increases prenatal
attendance, but the effect of enrollment in Oportunidades is reduced in those localities
with high levels of deprivation, as evidenced by the negative interaction term.

Harris & Sosa-Rubí

May 18, 2009

Page 25

The utilization estimates for latent class 2 in Table II show significant positive
coefficients for number of prior pregnancy losses, our index of household wealth, and a
history of diabetes, hypertension or urinary tract infections. Enrollment in social security
or Oportunidades also increases attendance, and the interaction with the index of
deprivation in the locality is again negative. Seguro Popular, however, does not have a
significant effect on prenatal visits in the second latent class.
The estimates for the third latent class in the rightmost column of Table II require
more scrutiny, as the signs of many of the significant coefficients are unexpectedly
negative. This reversal of sign is seen for such variables as age, secondary and high
school education, number of prior pregnancy losses, the index of household wealth, and
enrollment in social security or Oportunidades. Many of the same variables have a
significant positive sign in the ordered probit equation that determines latent class
composition. Thus, if a woman becomes a beneficiary of Oportunidades, she tends to
move out of the second and into the third latent class or, under our interpretation, her
doctor or midwife recognizes a previously undetected complication of pregnancy. We
assume that those inframarginal women who are already in the third latent class have the
most serious complications of pregnancy. If so, then a marginal rightward shift in the
distribution tends to decrease the average severity of complications in third latent class,
thus resulting in a negative association between Oportunidades and prenatal attendance.
Figure 1 compares the predicted distribution with the empirical distribution of
prenatal visits in the sample population of 4,381 pregnant women. The predicted
distribution is displayed as three partially superimposed vertical bar graphs, each
corresponding to a separate latent class. For each class k = 1, 2, 3 , the vertical bars

Harris & Sosa-Rubí

May 18, 2009

Page 26

represent the predicted unconditional distribution of prenatal visits, that is, π k fk ( n ) as a
function of n . In Figure 2, the empirical distribution is compared to the predicted
3

distribution of prenatal visits for the three latent classes combined, that is,

∑ π f ( n ) as
k =1

k k

a function of n .
Figures 1 and 2 show a generally good fit between the empirical and predicted
distribution of visits. A total of 3.22 percent of women had no prenatal visits, while the
predicted proportion was 3.04 percent, nearly all of which represented the contribution of
the first latent class. A total of 1.12 percent of women had 1 prenatal visit, while the
predicted proportion was 1.13 percent, consisting of 0.66 percent in class 1 and 0.47
percent in class 2. At nine visits, there is a marked deviation between the observed
frequency (23.90%) and the predicted frequency (9.97%). This deviation may be due
respondents’ tendency to report one visit per month, or 9 per pregnancy. Similar
deviations between observed and predicted frequencies are seen at 15 visits (3.38%
versus 1.01%) and 20 visits (1.28% versus 0.27%), which may also be due to rounding by
respondents. As a consequence of these deviations, a chi-squared test rejects the
hypothesis that the observed and predicted distributions are indistinguishable

( P < 0.001) .
4.2. Comparison of Alternative Models
Table III displays the results of our comparison of alternative models. Model A,
in the first row, corresponds to our principal specification. By contrast, in Model B, we
retain three latent classes and the ordered probit model of latent class membership, but
assume that SP is an exogenous variable. Equivalently, the correlation coefficient ρ of

Harris & Sosa-Rubí

May 18, 2009

Page 27

error terms in equation (16) is assumed to equal zero. In Model C, we restrict our
analysis to two latent classes, retaining a probit equation for class membership with SP as
an endogenous variable. Equivalently, the threshold parameter κ in equation (14) is
assumed to equal zero, while the parameter ρ in equation (16) remains unrestricted. In
Model D, we replace the ordered probit specification with a multinomial logit model of
latent class membership with SP as an exogenous variable, as specified in equation (21).
Model E entails fixed mixing probabilities, as specified in equation (8). Finally, we
include Model F, which represents a naïve Poisson model with no latent classes.
As noted above, all of our alternative models except Model D are nested within
our principal Model A. Based upon the standard log likelihood ratio test, all of these
models are rejected in favor of Model A. Thus, the test statistic computed as twice
difference in log likelihood between Models A and B, which is distributed as χ 2 with 1
degree of freedom, is equal to 5.04. Hence, we reject Model B at the significance level
P = 0.0248 . Similarly, the test statistic computed as twice the difference in log
likelihood between Models A and E, which is distributed as χ 2 with 17 degrees of
freedom, is equal to 93.65. Hence, we rejected Model E at the significance level

P < 10 −6 . Finally, while the multinomial logit Model D is not nested in our principal
Model A, we find that Model A is superior by both the AIC and BIC criteria.
Appendix Tables I, II, and III, respectively, display the coefficient estimates of
Models B, C, and D. In Model B, when the endogeneity of Seguro Popular is ignored, its
effect in the ordered probit equation for latent class membership was reduced by more
than half. In Model C, when only two latent classes were assumed, the population mean
numbers of visits were 1.4 and 7.7, respectively. The two-class model thus failed to

Harris & Sosa-Rubí

May 18, 2009

Page 28

identify the subpopulation of women who, under our interpretation, had recognized
complications of pregnancy. In Model D, which does not account for the potential
endogeneity Seguro Popular, the coefficient of SP was not significant either in the
equation for class 2 versus class 1 membership, or in the equation for class 3 versus class
1 membership. In both Models B and D, we continued to observed significant negative
parameter estimates for such variables as education, prior pregnancy losses, household
wealth, and social security enrollment in the conditional Poisson utilization model for
latent class 3. Thus, the negative coefficients for these variables in our principal model,
as shown in the rightmost column of Table II, do not appear to be an artifact of the
ordered probit specification or the treatment of SP as endogenous.
In the ordered probit Model A, any explanatory variable such as SP that shifts
pregnant women in class 1 rightward to class 2 must also shift pregnant women in class 2
rightward to class 3. The alternative multinomial logit Model D, by contrast, does not
impose such a restriction. In that model, an explanatory variable such as SP could, at
least in principle, shift pregnant women in class 1 rightward to class 2 and, at the same
time, shift pregnant women in class 3 leftward to class 2. To test whether the ordering
restriction imposed by our principal Model A has a significant effect on the predicted
probabilities of class membership, we compared the predicted values of the latent class
probabilities for Model A with the corresponding predicted values of the latent class
probabilities for Model D.
To simplify the notation, let π ikA = π k ( Zi ,Wi , yi ,θ ) denote the probability that
pregnant woman i = 1,…M belongs to latent class k = 1, 2, 3 , as predicted from equation
(17) based the parameter estimates for θ in Model A. Similarly, let π ikD = π k ( Zi ,θ )

Harris & Sosa-Rubí

May 18, 2009

Page 29

denote the corresponding probability predicted from equation (21) based on the

(

)

(

parameter estimates for θ in Model D. Let π iA = π i1A , π iA2 , π iA3 and π iD = π i1D , π iD2 , π iD3

)

denote the corresponding vectors. We computed the Euclidean distance Δ i = π iA − π iD
for each pregnant woman i = 1,…M in our sample, where the distance Δ i ranges from 0
to a maximum possible value of

2 . In our sample of M = 4, 381 pregnant women, the

median value of Δ i was 0.012, while 4,155 women (94.8 percent) had values of

Δ i < 0.5 .
Since each of the vectors π iA and π iD is contained within the two-dimensional
simplex S =

{(π , π , π ) π
1

2

3

1

}

+ π 2 + π 3 = 1 , we can plot them within a triangular planar

region. The use of such triangular plots in economics dates back at least to McKenzie’s
analysis of factor prices in world trade (McKenzie 1955). (See also Leamer’s use of
“endowment triangles” in a three-factor general equilibrium model (Leamer 1987).)
Figure 3 contains a pair of triangular plots, the upper panel displaying the values of π iA ,
and the lower panel displaying the corresponding plot of the values of π iD . In both of the
panels in Figure 3, the three vertices of the triangle refer to the respective corners of the
simplex, that is, (1, 0, 0 ) , ( 0,1, 0 ) , and ( 0,1, 0 ) . The three sides correspond to the lines
where one of the three components of the vector (π 1 , π 2 , π 3 ) is zero. In each graph, the
gray points represent the 4,155 women with a value of Δ i < 0.5 , while the black solid
points represent the remaining 226 women with a value of Δ i ≥ 0.5 .
If the unordered multinomial logit Model D did not adhere to the ordering
imposed by our principal Model A, then we would expect to see a large number of points

Harris & Sosa-Rubí

May 18, 2009

Page 30

situated along or close to the bottom margin of the triangle in the bottom panel of Figure
3, where π 1 > 0 and π 3 > 0 , but π 2 ≈ 0 . In fact, nearly all the points lie very close to the
left and right sides of the triangle. Put differently, the vast majority of women were
found either to have some probability of belonging to latent classes 1 and 2 or some
probability of belonging to latent classes 2 and 3, a finding that supports the validity of
the ordered probit specification.

4.3. Estimation of Treatment Effects
Table III also shows the estimated treatment effects for our principal model and
each of our alternative models. In all cases, we have computed both the population mean
and median effects on the predicted number of prenatal visits. The pair of columns under
the heading “Effect of Seguro Popular” refers to the direct effect of SP on the number of
prenatal visits, that is, the “treatment effect on the treated,” as defined in equation (23).
The pair of columns under the heading “Marginal Effect of SP Penetration” refers to the
indirect effect of a 10-percent increase in SP penetration on the number of prenatal visits,
that is, the “policy relevant treatment effect,” as defined in equation (27). In the latter
case, we interpret the penetration of SP as a policy indicator of local, state and federal
efforts to enroll eligible households into the program.
For both the direct effect of SP and the indirect effect of SP penetration, the
distribution of estimated individual treatment effects was asymmetric and skewed to the
right. Thus, the mean treatment effects were consistently larger than the corresponding
median effects. For both types of treatment effects, our principal Model A predicted a
much larger impact than the alternative models. Under Model A, the effect of the

Harris & Sosa-Rubí

May 18, 2009

Page 31

treatment on the treated corresponded to mean increase of 1.65 prenatal visits. Failure to
take account of the endogeneity of SP in Model B reduced the estimated mean direct
effect of SP to 1.31 visits, that is, by approximately 21 percent.
As shown in equation (24) above, the direct effect of SP in Model A could be
decomposed into a change in the mean number of visits within latent classes (the first
3

term

∑ π (1)( λ (1) − λ ( 0 )) in equation 24) and a shift in the distribution of latent

classes (the second term

∑ (π (1) − π ( 0 )) λ ( 0 ) in equation 24).

These components

were, respectively, 0.976 visits (or 59% of the effect) and 0.675 visits (or 41% of the
effect). The first component was dominated by the effect of SP on the number of
prenatal visits among women who remained in latent class 1 (that is, by

(π (1) − π ( 0 )) λ ( 0 ) in equation 24), while the second effect was dominated by the
i1

movement of pregnant women into latent class 3 (that is, by (π i 3 (1) − π i 3 ( 0 )) λi 3 ( 0 ) in
equation 24). Under our interpretation of the latent classes, the direct treatment effect of
SP derived predominantly from a combination of two impacts: increased prenatal
attendance among pregnant women with little or no access to care, and increased
recognition of pregnancy complications prior to labor.
5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
In this observational study of a cross-sectional survey database, we found that
Seguro Popular increased access to prenatal care for Mexican women who gave birth
during 2002–2005. Specifically, enrollment in SP was associated with a mean increase in
1.65 prenatal visits during pregnancy (Table III). Approximately 59 percent of this

Harris & Sosa-Rubí

May 18, 2009

Page 32

treatment effect was the result of increased prenatal care among women in the first latent
class, that is, women who had with little or no access to care. The remaining 41 percent
of the treatment effect was the result of a shift in membership from the second to the third
latent class, which we interpret as increased recognition of complications of pregnancy
prior to labor and delivery.
These estimates represent the effect of the treatment (that is, Seguro Popular) on
the treated (pregnant women whose households enrolled in SP). In an attempt to assess
the effect of a policy-relevant treatment, we also studied the effect of an absolute increase
of 10-percentage points in local penetration of Seguro Popular, that is, the proportion of
eligible women enrolled in SP in the local area. We view local penetration as an
intermediate measure of efforts by state health departments to upgrade health facilities to
meet federal standards and then enroll eligible households. We estimated that a 10percent increase in local penetration would result in a mean increase of 0.139 prenatal
visits (Table III). Based upon published budgetary and coverage data (Comisión
Nacional de Protección Social en Salud 2007; Comisión Nacional de Protección Social en
Salud 2007), we estimate that a 10-percent increase in local penetration required a
governmental investment of approximately USD 526 in the year 2006.** However, full

**

In 2006, the federal government transferred 4.608 billion pesos to the states as part of the Seguro Popular

program (Comisión Nacional de Protección Social en Salud 2007). The number of affiliated households at
the close of 2005 was 3.556 million (Comisión Nacional de Protección Social en Salud 2007). Given these
data and the prevailing exchange rate of 10.25 pesos per USD, we estimate that in 2006, the federal
government allocated to each state an average of USD 126 per affiliated household. There were 11.898
million eligible households in a total of 285,823 localities in Mexico (Comisión Nacional de Protección
Social en Salud 2007), or an average of 41.6 eligible households per locality. An increase in 10% in the
penetration of SP thus required enrolling an average of 4.16 households, which comes to USD 526.

Harris & Sosa-Rubí

May 18, 2009

Page 33

evaluation of such a marginal investment would require us to assess all of the potential
benefits of Seguro Popular, and not simply the increment in prenatal visits.
Our analysis adds to the small but growing number of studies that model the
probability of latent class membership as a function of observed covariates (Nagin and
Land 1993; Roeder, Lynch et al. 1999; Greene and Hensher 2003; Clark, Elité et al.
2005; Bago d'Uva 2006; Clark and Etile 2006; Bago d'Uva and Jones 2008; Greene,
Harris et al. 2008). Our research is distinguishable from prior work in that we explicitly
address the problem of endogeneity in modeling latent class membership. We thus
attempt to confront a serious drawback in the application of latent class models to
observational data on health care utilization. We find, in fact, that failure to account for
the endogeneity of Seguro Popular results in a significant underestimate of the impact of
this public policy program on the utilization of prenatal care (Table III). Moreover, we
show how the EM algorithm can substantially reduce the computational burden of such
models. Specifically, at each stage of the iterative algorithm, the parameters of the model
of latent class membership can be estimated separately from the parameters of the model
of health care utilization.
Our study has several limitations. First, we used an ordered probit specification
to model latent class membership. The assumption of joint normally distributed errors,
inherent in the probit specification, simplified the task of incorporating endogeneity into
the model of latent class membership, but the ordering imposed by our model may have
been too restrictive. It is reassuring that the unrestricted multinomial logit specification
gave nearly the same probability distribution of class membership (Figure 3).

Second, our conditional utilization model for the third latent class yielded
unexpected negative coefficients for such covariates as the woman’s education, the
household’s assets, and household enrollment in social security (Table II). These
covariates were also found to shift the distribution of latent class membership to the right.
That is, higher educational or household wealth attainment permits a woman to recognize
a previously undetected complication of pregnancy, thus moving her at the margin from
the second to the third latent class. If the inframarginal women already in the third latent
class had the most serious complications requiring the largest number of prenatal visits,
then a marginal rightward shift in the distribution would tend to decrease the average
severity of complications in third latent class. This would result in a negative association
between education or household wealth and prenatal attendance. The negative
coefficients for the third latent class do not appear to be an artifact of our ordered probit
model of class membership, as they are likewise observed in other less restricted models
(Appendix Tables I and III).
Third, we have not pursued a number of potentially important analytical strategies
for assessing the impact of Seguro Popular on prenatal care. In particular, we did not
estimate two-part models (Pohlmeier and Ulrich 1995; Chen, Liu et al. 2003; Sepehri,
Sarma et al. 2008). To be sure, we found that pregnant women in our first latent class
had a mean of 0.52 prenatal visits (Table II and Figure 1), and our predicted distribution
of the number of visits accurately captured the observed mode at zero visits (Figure 2).
Nonetheless, we have made no formal tests of the accuracy of a two-part model against
our latent class model. Moreover, our conditional utilization models relied upon the
Poisson distribution. We did not test alternative specifications for the number of prenatal

Harris & Sosa-Rubí

visits, such as the negative binomial distribution (Chen, Liu et al. 2003; Sepehri, Sarma et
al. 2008). Further research is required to determine whether a finite latent class model in
which class membership depends on observed covariates better captures the
heterogeneity that is implicit in the negative binomial distribution. Finally, our sole
measure of prenatal care was the number of visits. We did not address the timing of the
first visit (Harris 1982; Wong, Popkin et al. 1987; Magadi, Madise et al. 2000), the type
of provider (Pebley, Goldman et al. 1996), or the content of care (Wong, Popkin et al.
1987) in the present study.
