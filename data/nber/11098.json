    "abstract": "\n\nGovernments around the world have enacted or are currently  considering fundamental structural reforms of their Social Security pension programs.   The key feature in these reforms is a shift from a pure pay-as-you-go tax-financed system, in which taxes on current workers are primarily distributed to current retirees,  to a mixed system that combines pay-as-you-go benefits with investment-based personal retirement accounts.\n\tThis paper discusses how such a  mixed system could work in practice and how the transition to such a change could be achieved.  It then analyzes  the economic gains that would result from shifting to a mixed system.  I turn next to the three problems that critics raise about any investment-based plan: administrative costs,   risk, and income distribution.  Finally, I comment on some of the ad hoc proposals for dealing  with the financial problem of Social Security without shifting to an investment-based system.\n\n",
