Short — Term Movements of Long — Term
Real Intere St Rates:
Ev idence from
the U.K. Indexed Bond Market

ABSTRACT

The central government now issues both nomi nal and inflation indexed
long—term bonds i n the United Kingdom. The diff erence in their yields
provides one measure of the long-term expected r ate of inflation. The
evidence suggests that higher long—term, cx pected, real yields are
associated with forecasts of higher income,
with tighter monetary policy,
and with positive aggregate suppi y shocks. Changes in the short—term
growth rate of the monetary base, which pre sumably capture the so—called
liquidity effect on short-term in terest rat es, do not perceptibly alter
long-term real rates. Long-term real rates also appear to be unaffected
by
the rate of expected inflation. Comparison with nominal interest rate
equation estimates reveals that concl usi ons about the effect of all
variables are extremely sensitive to the choice of a proxy for
expected
long-term inflation.

before this regime switch.

Ball (1965) examines the movement of the annual average yield on

consols over the 1921—61 period. Though he concludes that movnents in
money (relative to income) are negatively associated with movements in the

nominal long rate, he finds no evidence "that the rate of inflation
affected

the bond rate" (p. 91) . As he notes, deriving a measure of the

average inflation expected over the infinite future is problematic. As
proxies for the desired measure, Ball uses actual year-over-year inflation
and a geometrically-declining weighted average (with decay rate 0.5) of

past inflation. Neither proxy significantly affects nominal rates over the
whole sample or over its post-war portion. From 1921 to 1961, the price
level grew at an annual compound rate of 2 percent. Year-to-year inflation

-3—

rates, however, ranged from minus 20 percent (1921—1922) to plus 20 percent

(1950-1951) during this sample period. Since the horizon of the expected
inflation rate relevant for consols is very long, expected inflation
proxies with such large weights on recent observations of inflation are

likely to be dominated by measurement errors. Obtaining near-zero
estimated coefficients on these measures of expected inflation then is not

surprising. Nor is it compelling evidence that long nominal rates are
immune to expected long-term inflation.
The

other empirical studies of U.K. interest rates focus on short-term

interest rates, where more reliable proxies for the inflation rate
expected

over the relevan t term are usually thought to be obtainable. Demer
y and

Duck (1978) and Foster (1979) use the Carison and Parkin (1975) sur
veybased proxy for expected (6 month) inflation in short-term (3 month
nominal interest rate equations. Both articles obtain estimates of
the
reaction of nomi nal interest rates to expected inflation that are
significant but considerably below one. Demery and D
uck's point estimates
of the long-run response of short—term rates average
about 0.65; Foster's
average less th an 0.50. The Carlson-Parkin data may
approximate market
expectations of inflation over the upcoming six mont hs with considerable
error (see Evans and Gulamani (1984)). Second, data
limitations prevent

matching the term to maturity of interest rates (3 months) to that of the
expected inflatio n rate proxy (6 months). Together, these factors may
produce downward bias in the expected inflation coefficient estimate that

is sizable. Even with a perfect expected inflation
measure, we would not
expect its coeffi cient to be unity in these specifications. Levi and Makin

(1978) demonstrate that the reaction of short-term interest rates to short-

-4-

term expected inflation is likely to be smaller in the short—run than in

the long—run. Even if short real rates are impervious to inflation in the
long run, until that long run arrives, nominal short rates would not rise

one—for-one with expected inflation. Each of these articles also presents
evidence that demand pressure (as measured by job vacancies) raises rates
and that the liquidity effect associated with faster money growth reduces

real rates. Such reductions are due to the acceleration and not the level

of money growth. Since far—forward short—term interest rates are likely to
be much less (if at all) affected by current deviations of output from
equilibrium or by the acceleration of money growth, the effects of these
latter two forces on long—term real rates are likely to be attenuated.
Symons (1983) foresakes the Carison—Parkin data in favor of a

forecasting equation for inflation. His ex-ante, or expected, real short
rate is constructed by subtracting forecasted inflation from the nominal

interest rate. Symons then tests only whether actual inflation affects his
expected real rates, not whether expected does. Given accelerations in
money growth, he finds that his expected real short rate is not affected by

actual inflation. To the extent that Symons' inflation forecasting
equation provides a proxy that more accurately captures movement in
expected inflation than does actual inflation (the presumption underlying
the construction of his expected real rate), however, we want to know the

response of expected real rates to expected inflation. Since he finds a
"substantial" difference between actual and his expected inflation measure,
these results tell us little about the response of expected real rates to
expected inflation.

—5—

Here we examine the movements of long-term yields, which can be viewed
as a weighted average of forward short rates. Since the dynamics alluded
to by Levi and Makin are likely to be more complete the longer the horizon,
the response of long—term yields to 1ong-term factors is likely to be

larger. Compared to estimates from s tatic specifications for short rates,

II. A Model of Real Interest Rates
The model in this section seeks to incorporate some of the major
measurable forces that drive long term interest rates. The implied reduced

variables. The aggregate demand side of the economy is composed of
expenditure (1) and portfolio balance (2) functions. The aggregate supply
side has been condensed into a price function (3). Equation (4) defines
the nominal interest rate as the real rate plus the (expected) inflation

rate. The presumed sign of the derivative of the left-hand-side variable
precedes each of the respective right-hand-side variables.

The inclusion of the relative price of energy term allows for the
possibility that business expenditure falls in response to the reduced
profitability associated with higher real input costs (see Wilcox (1983)).

uncompetitive and production contracted sharply." (p. 37)
Equation (2) posits that the demand for the monetary base in real

terms depends on real income and on the nominal interest rate (i). The
aggregate supply function (3) relates the price level to the expected price
level (pe) through nominal wages, to output, and to the relative price of

oil. Increases in real energy costs may lower real wages, increase costs
to firms, and lower equilibrium output; the net effect on real rates of

these changes is ambiguous. The quasi-reduced form for real interest rates

III. Determinants of Real Rates
The U.K. began issuing indexed bonds in 1981. Until March, 1982 only
pension funds were allowed to hold these real bonds. The first issue
carried an initial coupon of two percent and matures in 1996. Since this
maturity has the longest history, we use its yield as our measure of the
expected long-term real yield. Both coupon payiients and principal are
indexed, one-for—one, with the U.K. equivalent of the CPI, the retail price
index (RPI).5

To obtain

a measure of expected inflation embedded in the

prices of these assets, we subtract the real yield from the nominal yield

on U.K. government bonds maturing in 1997. The arithmetic spread between
nominal and real yields then consists of expected inflation and an

inflation risk premium. This measure of expected inflation may be biased
downward (or upward) by a positive (or negative) inflation risk premium.

-8-

There may well be such a premium. As long as it is either constant or
uncorrelated over time wi th the other variables, however, its omissi on will
not bias our coefficient estimates. It ml ght be pres umed that, to the
extent there is an inflat ion risk premium, it is positive and rises with

maturity. For mat unties between 6 and 36 years, however, the nomin al-real
yield differential was vi rtually constant at 7 per cent in 1 ate 1984.

Rows 2 through 7 add various combinations of the remaining variables

of which specification we look at,
expected inflation never affects real yields by either an economically or

statistically significant amount. Increases in the mdex of leading
economic indicators (ILl) drive real rates up. Tighter overall monetary
policy (lower MBP) raises rates as well but the liquidity effect (GMB)
though perhaps important at short maturities, has no discernible impact on

these long real rates. The supply shock proxy, RPOIL, is consistently and
strongly negative. These estimates also

IV. Tax Effects
Whether there are income tax rate effects on U.S. interest rates has
been a matter of dispute ever since the theoretical argument was put forth

by Darby (1975), Feldstein (1976), and Tanzi (1976). Table 2 presents the
results of testing for tax effects using non-nested specification tests
like those used by Peek (1982) in tests for tax effects on U.S. short-term

interest rates. We may interpret the specification of the model to this
point as being appropriate if either taxes are ignored or if the marginal
pound of investment income and expense is tax—free.
If that marginal pound faces a constant, proportional income tax rate, t,
the real after-tax interest rate, ra.t., is now determined by the model.

estimated coeffi cient when the fitted value variable from the taxunadjusted model is added to the tax-adjusted model is -O.35(t= —0.16).

These test coeff icients sum almost precisely to unity. They need not be.
Nor need they lie between zero and one, though that might seem intuitive.
These results from row 1 weakly favor adjusting for

I n come

tax rate

effects. The tax—unadjusted models fitted values add nothing to the
alternative. The coefficients in both tests in row 1 simultaneously differ
insignificantly from zero and from one, however.

Row 2 uses the same tax rate series but sets the pre—1982:3 rates
equal to zero, since only tax—exempt pension funds could hold index-linked

bonds then. This specification of the test favors the tax-un adj usted
model. Thus, this row provides equally weak support for this alternative
model. Row 3 drops the pre—1982:3 observations altogether. The results
again provide no strong Support for either model against the other. This

evidence is eminently inconclusive. Two reasons may be given. Over this
short span of time ordinary income tax rates varied very little and
unearned income tax rates were unchanged until mid-1984.

Second, t he

pattern of effective tax rates expected over the life of the bond, and not
the current realized tax rate, may be the relevant tax r ate. As ti me
passes, additional data may come to support one model relative to the
other.

Given the evidence summarized in table 2 and that the conclusions

differ immaterially, we use the tax-unadjusted specification I n what
follows.

V. Alternative Measures of Expected Inflation
The measure of long term expected inflati on used in Figure 1, p. is
replotted in Figure 2 a long with two alternative proxies, the actua
inflation rat e over the last twelve months (p12) and that over the last
three months (p3). All three decline sharply from late 1 981 until

1 ate

1982 and have trendless movements thereafter. Not surpri singly act ual
shorter-term infl ation measures are more volatile than p.

Somewhat

surprisi ngly, these al ternative measures do move fairly ci osely with p; the

correlation b etween p and p12 is 0.94, the correl ation bet ween p and

0.72. These

correl ati ons may imply litt le about causation

p3

however

Bivariate Granger tests (using four lags due to the brevity of the

s am ple)

do not reject the hypothesis that p is unrelated to p12 or to p

Nor can

the converse hypotheses be rejected. Nor would we necessarily expect a
tight relation between them.

Nevertheless, it will prove inter esti ng to

examine how t hese other measures perform in long-term interest rate
equations.

Table 3 shows the effect of alternative expected inflation measures on

real

and nominal interest rate equation estimates. Row 1 uses p, the

difference between real and nominal yields, as the expected inflation
measure and therefore is identical to row 7 of Table 1.

Rows 2, 3, and 4

use as alternative expected inflation measures, p12, p3. and i, the nominal

interest rate. This last measure is included on the argument that nominal
rates predict inflation well. p12 and p3 are considered not because of a
prior belief that they predict long-term inflation well, but to examine the
sensitivity of the estimates to different expected inflation proxies.

Judgments about robustness to these differences in specification have to be
tempered by the limited period for which data are available.

The alternative expected inflation proxies deliver real rate equation
estimates which are remarkably similar. The estimated expected inflation
coeffi cien ts are each virtually zero, ranging from -0.033 to 0.052. Only

for p3 is there a statistically signi ficant effect. Conclusions about
significan ce and even the size of the other variables effects are also all
but invari ant to the choice of proxy

This is surprising given the

rel atively large correl ation between p and r(-O.51) and between p and the

other explanatory variables (ILI(-0.62), MBP(0.46), GMB(—O.60), and
RPOIL(0.43)). Al so notable is t he fact that the model based on p3, which it

might be argued would be a poor proxy for long-term expected inflation,

fits best. Its standard error of 0.1427 is nearly 10 percent smaller than
that based on p •

Row 4 illustr ates that, though nominal interest rates may

be very highly correlated with expected inflation (correlation =

0.98),

other variables may still be si gnificantly related to real rate movements.

respective coefficients are 0.433 and 0.197. And no longer are the
estimated coefficients on the remaining variables robust to which proxy is

used. The entire pattern of significance (and sometimes sign) is reversed
when p12 and p3 are substituted for p. The overall fits also deteriorate

—17-

dramatically, standard errors of the estimate (S.E.E.) rising by a factor
of three or four.

Rows 1 through 4 suggest that we can assess the effects on real rates
of variables other than expected inflation by choosing any of the four
proxies used there or by omitting a proxy altogether since the coefficients

are very close to zero and generally insignificant. To do this, however,
requires a measure of r. Without a direct measure of r or p for this

maturity, we must effectively use i as the dependent variable. The
coefficients and significance of the variables other than expected
inflation are then extremely sensitive to the proxy chosen, as we see from
rows 5 through 7.

This is ironic. Given an indexed bond market, we would

not need to generate p to assess effects on real rates since they would be

directly observable. Real rate equations could be estimated directly.
Without an indexed market, however, we require the (unobtainable, implicit,
market) forecast of inflation to obtain accurate estimates of the real

interest rate equation. These last rows then indicate that assessing the
effects of any of these factors on long real rates may be extremely
problematic without an indexed market or some other way of generating a
long-term expected inflation proxy.

VI. Concluding Remarks
Assessing the level, movement, and determinants of long-term real
interest rates has been difficult because of the lack of either direct
measures of the rates themselves or widely accepted proxies for long-term

inflation. The operation of the indexed government bond market in the U.K.

in

recent years provides a new source of information on both real rates and

-18-

expected inflation. The evidence to date suggests that real rates are
unaffected by expected inflation but are affected by forecasts of demand,

by monetary policy, and by supply shocks. It also suggests that expected
long-term inflation may be quite volatile.

The simultaneous operation of real and nominal long-term bond markets
also allows us to assess the robustness of conclusions about real rates

based on nominal interest rate equation estimates. More sophisticated
measures of expected long—term inflation than the alternatives used here

can probably be constructed. Section V, however, suggests that conclusions
about expected, long-term real rates may prove extremely sensitive to the

choice of expected inflation proxy. Though the correlation between p and
p12 is quite high (0.94), for example, the conclusions based on these
proxies are drastically different.

1.

For simplicity, unless otherwise noted, interest rates refer to long—
term, expected real interest rates. The same shorthand applies to
inflation. Cargill and Meyer (1980) point out the advantages and
difficulties of matching interest rate and expected inflation
maturities.

2.

By 1984, about one-third of the flow of new central government debt
issued was indexed and about ten percent of the outstanding stock was
indexed.

Barclays Bank apparently took this quote from the Bank of England. It
does not cite the source. This change in policy seems the natural
result of focussing more on monetary aggregate growth rates and less
on market yields.

p in (3) refers to the price level expected a short time into the
future. A true reduced form would have solved the actual price level
out of MBP and RPOIL, replacing it with pe I do not think the
results are materially affected. Since no measure of pe is available,
I feel that the
the alternative is to use a constructed pe series.
formulation based on actual P serves as well as any based on
constructed pe is likely to. The movements in the other components of
MBP and RPOIL dilute the impact of this measurement error to some
extent.
5.

The indexing is not completely neutral, however. Coupon and principal
are indexed to the RPI eight months earlier. There is a two month RPI
reporting lag. Secondly, there is a perceived need to ascertain
accrued interest between semi—annual coupon payments for day-to-day
trading purposes. The eight-month lag is, therefore, due to the need
to determine accrued interest." (Rutterford (1983)).

We restrict the sample period to a July, 1981 starting date to allow
the market to become established.

Later we compare this expected inflation measure with actual inflation
over this same period.

Regressing first differences of r on those of i (with no constant

10. Other variants of this liquidity effect proxy, like the growth rates
of either the real monetary base or real Ml over three or twelve
months or the growth rate of nominal Ml over the past six months
relative to its growth rate over the last three years, produced
similar results. The specification in the text produced a somewhat
better overall fit.

For 1983, it is 0.332. We use the same value for 1984 as for 1983.
