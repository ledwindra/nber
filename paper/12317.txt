Media Markets and Localism: Does Local News en Español Boost Hispanic Voter Turnout?

ABSTRACT
Since the dawn of broadcasting, and especially in the past decade, Americans have turned their
attention from local to more distant sources of news and entertainment. While the integration of
media markets will raise the private welfare of many consumers, a globalized information and
entertainment industry can undermine civic engagement, transforming locally engaged citizens into
viewers consuming programming from distant sources. In response to such concerns, many
regulatory agencies, including the Federal Communication Commission in the United States, curtail
the integration of media markets to promote “localism.” Determining the right balance between the
private benefits of integrated markets and the public value of civic engagement requires evidence
on the size of the positive spillovers from local media. In this paper, we exploit the rapid growth of
Hispanic communities in the United States to test whether the presence of local television news
affects local civic behavior. We find that Hispanic voter turnout increased by 5 to 10 percentage
points, relative to non-Hispanic voter turnout, in markets where local Spanish-language television
news became available. Thus, the tradeoff between integrated media markets and civic engagement
is real, and our results provide a basis for the continued pursuit of regulatory policies that promote
localism.

Introduction

The increased integration of markets for news and entertainment fundamentally
changes the quality and quantity of media products available to consumers. Because the
production of entertainment and news is characterized by significant fixed cost, increases
in market size raise the number and quality of products. Consequently, more viewers can
watch shows that better match their preferences. For instance, satellite and cable TV
have brought American football to Europe, Japanese anime to Latin America and
Mexican soap operas to the United States. But the availability of these products can
reduce the consumption of local news and entertainment in two ways. First, consumers
who prefer anime to local news will watch the former. Second, the local media products
that lose their audiences may be forced to change their targeting or cut quality, and they
may even cease to exist if their audience falls below a critical threshold. Thus, in
integrated media markets, even those who prefer local content may end up watching
globalized shows. For these reasons, some scholars claim that the rise of integrated
media transforms locally engaged citizens into passive viewers and undermines civic
society (Putnam, 2000).
Against this backdrop, many regulatory agencies, including the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) of the United States, seek to protect local media
and promote localism. In the words of former FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell,
“fostering localism is one of this Commission’s core missions and one of three policy
goals, along with diversity and competition, which have driven much of our radio and
television broadcast regulation during the last 70 years.”

Is “localism” really desirable? In particular, are there positive spillovers from the
provision of local content that can help justify the loss of private welfare that integrated
media markets would produce? In this paper we propose a simple test for the presence of
spillovers from local news programming. We ask if the presence of local television news
affects local civic behavior. The ubiquity of local television news programming across
all US metro areas makes it impossible to study its effects on the general population. In
contrast, the availability of Spanish-language local television news has changed
considerably in recent years, providing us with an experiment to study the effect of local
news on electoral participation. The number of metropolitan areas with Spanishlanguage local television news (on Telemundo or Univision) grew from 14 in 1994 to 25
in 2002. This trend reflects the rapid increase in the U.S. Hispanic population, which
grew by 58 percent between 1990 and 2000, from 22 to 38 million. The non-Hispanic
US population increased by 9 percent over the same time period.
We use cross-sectional and time-series variation in the availability of news in
Spanish to study its effects on one important measure of civic engagement, voter turnout.
We find that, relative to non-Hispanic electoral participation, Hispanic turnout is five to
ten percentage points higher in markets with Spanish-language local television news.
Longitudinal estimates, based on markets that get a first local Spanish-language news
program between 1994 and 2002, are somewhat smaller but still economically and
statistically significant. For the case of Spanish-language television news, the spillovers
from local media to civic engagement exist, and they appear to be fairly important.
Documenting an increase in spillovers for television is of particular interest
because, in the concern about disengagement from local activities, television is generally

2

singled out for the most criticism. There is compelling evidence, for example, that the
spread of television between 1950 and 1970 caused both the decline in local newspapers
and a substantial drop in voter turnout (Gentzkow, 2004). However, claims that
television undermines local civic engagement ascribe to a medium what is a more general
economic effect. As this study documents, even in today’s fairly integrated markets,
television is quite capable of increasing civic engagement if there is sufficient spatial
agglomeration of individuals with similar tastes. Based on our results, we conclude that
the decline in turnout that followed TV was not due to a specific effect of television; it
was market integration that undermined electoral participation. Our evidence that local
media affect engagement in local politics provides some empirical basis for the policy
promotion of localism across different forms of media.
This paper proceeds in four sections. We present some background on how the
number of products depends on the spatial distribution of consumer preferences in section
2. Section 3 introduces the data used in the study. Next, we present evidence on how the
availability of Spanish-language local television news depends on the size of the local
Hispanic population. In section 5, we present estimates of the effect of Spanish-language
local news on Hispanic voter turnout in non-presidential general elections. We conclude
with a discussion of how markets can undermine or foster civic engagement.

II.

Background

This study links the literature on entry in differentiated product markets with
recent models of political economy. There is ample evidence that, in the presence of
fixed costs, products are made available in markets only when large groups want them.
3

For instance, black-targeted radio stations are only available in markets with many black
citizens (Siegelman and Waldfogel, 2001; Waldfogel, 2004). Similarly, daily newspapers
report more frequently about issues of interest to blacks in cities with a larger black share
of population. This in turn increases black readership (George and Waldfogel, 2003). In
the context of this study, we expect to observe Spanish-language news programming only
in markets with a substantial number of Spanish speakers.
Hispanics in markets with local Spanish news, we believe, are also more likely to
participate in elections. Models of political economy suggest several reasons why betterinformed citizens are more likely to turn out. One explanation is that the consumption
benefits of voting might be larger if citizens are more confident of voting for the “right”
candidate (Matsusaka, 1995). Alternatively, less-informed voters can have an incentive
to delegate their vote to better informed citizens via abstention (Feddersen and
Pesendorfer, 1996, 1999). Whatever the underlying mechanisms, a well-documented,
strong empirical regularity is that people who receive campaign messages are more likely
to participate in elections (Cox and Munger, 1989; Caldeira, Clausen and Patterson,
1990; Bartels, 1993; Wielhouwer and Lockerbie, 1994; Shachar and Nalebuff, 1999;
Gerber and Green, 2000b). Thus, the basic premise of our approach is that Spanish
speakers will find it easier to become informed about an election, and candidates will find
it less complicated to reach likely Hispanic voters, in markets with local Spanish news.
Both mechanisms will raise the turnout of Hispanics.

III.

Data

4

The data for this study are drawn from three sources: the Current Population
Survey’s Voting Supplement, 1994-2002; the 1990 and 2000 US Census; and direct
collection of information on the availability of Spanish-language local television news in
US metropolitan areas. Specifically, we have an MSA panel for the even-numbered
years between 1994 and 2002 on the number of stations offering local news in Spanish
for all US metro areas, and individual-level voter turnout data from the CPS. The CPS
data also indicate the individuals’ MSA, Hispanic status, and various individual
characteristics. The metropolitan areas in our sample contain 85 percent of US Hispanic
population in 2000.
We gathered our list of stations broadcasting news in Spanish from the Telemundo
and Univision websites. We contacted each of these 50 stations to learn if they produce
and broadcast local news. We also know when these stations began airing local news in
Spanish. This information allows us to construct a variable indicating whether there is
local Spanish-language news in each year for 265 markets. We assume that the
metropolitan areas without affiliates of these networks lacked local Spanish news. In
1994, there were 14 metro areas with Spanish-language local news, containing 63 percent
of the Hispanics in the sample. By 2004, the number of sample metro areas with
Spanish-language local television news had increased to 25, and these 25 areas contained
76 percent of sample Hispanic population.1

In our approach, we assume that the availability of Spanish news reflects the size
of the Hispanic population. Table 1 explores the determinants of having at least one local
station broadcasting local news in Spanish via a probit relating the presence of Spanishlanguage local news to the size of the Hispanic and the non-Hispanic population. The
table reports probability derivatives for 1990 (panel A) and 2000 (panel B) Census data.
Not surprisingly, Hispanic population bears a positive and significant relationship to the
likelihood of having local news in Spanish. An additional million Hispanics raises the
probability by 45 percent in 1994. There is no such relationship for the non-Hispanic
population. The estimates for 1994 (panel A) imply that the Hispanic population needs to
reach a size of at least 350,000 for the probability of having Spanish news to exceed 50%.
As figure 1 shows, many more metro areas are to the right of this threshold in 2000 than
in 1990. By 2004, 25 of the 265 metro areas have at least one Spanish-language local
news broadcast (see table 2).
While Spanish-language local news is available in only selected metropolitan
areas, national news on Telemundo or Univision is available almost anywhere via cable
and sometimes also over the air during the entire study period. National news programs
cover the presidential election, so even Hispanic populations lacking local Spanishlanguage news had easy access to news about the presidential contests in 1996 and 2000.
The widespread availability of Spanish-language national news suggests that the effects
of Spanish-language local news programming on Hispanic turnout will be larger in nonpresidential election years.

V. Spanish Local News and Hispanic Voter Turnout

6

1. Empirical Strategy
We are interested in determining whether the availability of Spanish-language
local television news programming affects Hispanic voter turnout. A simple approach to
this question would be to relate an Hispanic individual’s turn-out decision to a measure of
the availability of Hispanic language news (HLN), estimating a model of the form
(1)

Vim = αHLN m + X i β + ν im

on a sample of Hispanic persons. In equation (1), Vim is a dummy indicating if individual
i who lives in metro area m voted. Xi contains characteristics of the individual, HLNm
indicates whether the area has Spanish-language local television news, and νim is an error
term.
A basic problem with this approach is that the tendency for individuals (Hispanic
or otherwise) to vote may be related to unobserved area factors, or that the error term is
really vim = μ m + ε im , where μm is common to all persons in the metro area. Factors of
this sort might include the ease with which persons can travel to the polls, or the weather.
If this is the form of unobserved differences, one solution is to “difference out” the
behavior of non-Hispanics. If δH is an indicator for whether a person is Hispanic, then we
can estimate
(2)

Vim = αHLN m + X i β + α H δ H HLN m + δ H X i β H + μ m + ε im

using the entire (Hispanic and non-Hispanic) sample. If Spanish-language news boosts
Hispanic turnout – but not non-Hispanic turnout – we expect αH to be positive. That is,
we expect the relationship between HLN and turnout to be more positive for Hispanics
than for non-Hispanics.

7

While appealing, the above approach remains vulnerable to a concern of groupspecific unobservables correlated with voter turnout. For example, Hispanics interested
in political participation may congregate in metropolitan areas with media outlets.
Circumventing this problem requires group-specific unobserved fixed effects for each
metro area. Because we have data on 5 separate elections – and because of the growth in
the availability of Spanish-language local news availability during our sample – we can
include group-specific MSA fixed effects in our models. That is, we can estimate a
longitudinal model of the form:
(3)

Vimt = αHLN mt + X it β + α H δ H HLN mt + δ H X it β H + φ t + μ mH + μ mNon − H + ε im ,

including group-specific MSA effects as well as time effects.
2. Results
Before turning to regression evidence, we can get suggestive evidence about the
effect of Spanish language local television news on Hispanic turnout from a comparison
of Hispanic and non-Hispanic turnout in markets with and without local Spanishlanguage television news (table 3). Using all available years for our sample markets
(panel A), Hispanic voter turnout averages 37 percent in markets without local Spanish
news and 45 percent in markets with local television news in Spanish. Non-Hispanic
turnout is 58 percent in markets without, and 60 percent in markets with Spanishlanguage local television news. Whatever is raising Hispanic turnout in the places with
Spanish-language television news, it does not affect non-Hispanics.
Panels B and C of table 3 separate presidential and non-presidential election
years. Two contrasts are immediately evident. First, turnout is much higher in
presidential election years, for both Hispanics and non-Hispanics, regardless of the local
8

media environment. Second, the difference in Hispanic turnout in places with and
without Hispanic local news, relative to the same geographic difference for nonHispanics, is slightly larger in absolute terms for non-presidential years. That is, the
difference in differences for non-presidential years is 7.6 percentage points, while the
difference in differences for presidential years is 6.3 points.2 Of course, the simple
statistics in table 3 are raw, and we turn to regressions to revisit these comparisons with
statistical controls.
Table 4 presents probit estimates of the model in equation (2), reporting
probability derivatives. The X variables included are indicators for income quartiles,
education level, and gender, as well as first and second-order terms in age. We allow the
coefficients on all X variables to vary by Hispanic status. The first column pools all years
of data, and the results echo table 3a. After accounting for individual observable
characteristics, the difference in non-Hispanic turnout is slightly negative (-2.6 points).
The difference in differences for Hispanics is 9.8 percentage points. Pooling the nonpresidential years, in column (2), the difference in differences is 11.1 percentage points,
while it is 7.7 percentage points for the presidential years. (We discuss columns (4)-(6)
below).
These results are consistent with other recent evidence on the relationship
between black-targeted local papers as well as radio stations and black voter turnout
(Oberholzer-Gee and Waldfogel, 2005). Like this one, that study documents elevated
turnout by blacks (relative to whites) that were particularly large in non-presidential
elections. The results above show that Spanish-language local television news boosts

2

To see this, note that (40.0-30.8) – (54.5-52.9) = 7.6, while (53.5-45.7)-(68.5-67.0)=6.3.

9

Hispanic voter turnout in non-presidential elections from about 30 to about 41 percent –
or by over a third. In presidential election years, the presence of Spanish-language local
television news appears to raise Hispanic turnout from about 46 to 54 percent, or by
about a sixth.
Table 5 presents longitudinal estimates of model (3), which we implement as a
linear probability model because of the large number of dummy variables. We find that

αH is roughly 5 percentage points and statistically significant. While smaller than the
estimates from the cross sectional models, this still implies that HLN presence boosts
Hispanic turnout by roughly 15 percent. When we estimate the model separately for the
presidential and non-presidential election years, we obtain a statistically significant
estimate of 7.8 percentage points for non-presidential years and a statistically
insignificant estimate of 2.0 percentage points for presidential election years.
3. Robustness
The evidence in tables 4 and 5 shows that Hispanic voter turnout is higher in
places with Spanish-language local news. This result arises both in the cross section as
well as over time, as more places get Spanish-language local news. Earlier, in table 1, we
showed that places with more Hispanics are more likely to have access to Spanishlanguage local television news. A natural concern about our documented relationships
between Hispanic voter turnout and Spanish-language local television news is that it
actually reflects some other mechanism operating through the level or growth of local
Hispanic population. For example, a sufficiently large local Hispanic population may
facilitate the existence of other institutions, such as clubs or political organizations that

10

also boost voter turnout. If these organizations are more effective in local than in
national elections, their presence could explain the results in tables 4 and 5.
To explore this possibility, we estimate our basic models including the indicator
for Spanish local news as well as the size of the Hispanic population. In particular,
columns (4)-(6) of Table 4 add Hispanic population and its interaction with the Hispanic
dummy to model (2). In these models, the coefficients on the interaction of the Hispanic
dummy and the local Spanish news variable become smaller, but the basic pattern
remains, and the coefficient for non-presidential years retains its statistical significance
(0.07 rather than 0.11). Columns (4)-(6) of Table 5 add Hispanic population and its
interaction with the Hispanic dummy to the longitudinal model (3).3 As with the cross
sectional model, the coefficients decline although the pattern (of higher coefficients for
the non-presidential election years) remains the same. Rather than 0.077 (with a standard
error of 0.031), the coefficient falls to 0.053 (with a standard error of 0.033).
4. Size of the Estimated Effect
We take our results to indicate that Spanish-language news programs boost
Hispanic turnout by 5 to 10 percentage points overall. In non-presidential election years,
the periods when the presence of local news actually changes the kind of political
information available to Spanish-speakers through television, the effects are quite large.
The presence of Spanish-language local television news raises Hispanic turnout by 8 to
11 percentage points. Because Hispanic turnout averages 30 percent in non-presidential
elections in places without local Spanish-language televisions news, the effects are

3

We only observe Hispanic population by MSA at decennial frequency. We calculate each non-Censusyear’s population using constant MSA-specific geometric growth rates.

11

between 27 and 37 percent. Using Hispanics as a window into the possible effects of
television on political behavior, it appears that the effects of television on voter turnout
can be large and positive.
As a practical matter, local television news can substantially change the Hispanic
composition of the electorate. While Hispanics make up only 12.5 percent of the US
population, their share varies widely across areas. Across the 265 sample metro areas,
the median Hispanic share is 3.7 percent, while the 75th percentile is 8.4 percent, and the
90th percentile is 27.0 percent. Figure 2 illustrates the effect of local Spanish-language
television news on the Hispanic share of the electorate in non-presidential elections,
using a simple calculation: Assume (from table 3b) that 31 percent of Hispanics turn out
to vote if there is no Spanish-language local news, while 39 percent turn out if there is
Spanish-language local news (31 percent, plus the relatively conservative longitudinal
estimate). Assume (from table 3b) that 53 percent of non-Hispanics turn out in nonpresidential elections. Then, if h is the share of an area’s population that is Hispanic,
then the Hispanic share of the electorate is (0.31 + δ 0.08)h [(0.31 + δ 0.08)h + 0.53(1 − h)] ,
where δ is 1 if there is Spanish-language local news, 0 otherwise. Figure 2 plots the
Hispanic share of the electorate with and without Spanish-language local news. For
example, when Hispanics make up a quarter of local population, they make up 16.2
percent of the electorate without Spanish-language local news and 19.5 percent of the
electorate with Spanish-language local news. When Hispanics make up half of local
population, their corresponding shares of the electorate are 36.8 and 42.1.

VI.

Conclusion
12

With more integrated media markets and a larger variety of programming choices,
many consumers opt for non-local programming. While such choices enhance the private
benefits of media consumption, there is a concern that reduced localism undermines civic
engagement. Exploiting variation in the cost of accessing information about local
politics, we find support for this concern. Hispanics without access to local television
news are significantly less likely to participate in elections than Hispanics with access to
news in Spanish.
Finally, our study shows that television bears a mixed relationship with political
participation. Historically, the spread of television has been linked with declining
political participation. But it is important to distinguish medium-specific effects from the
effects of market integration. Television carries both local and national news. The
spread of television, like other national information sources, can attract people away from
local products and local affairs. But television can also include local content, chiefly
local news, and we find that the availability of Spanish-language local television news
significantly boosts Hispanic voter turnout. Even today, television is quite capable of
increasing civic engagement if there is sufficient spatial agglomeration of individuals
with similar tastes.
