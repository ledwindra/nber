Likewise, Section II derives the essential time series properties of the real exchange rate. Positive implications of the intertemporal approach against panel and international cross section data are analyzed in Section III. Section IV brings out evidence relevant for the normative implications of the intertemporal approach, highlighting the role of taxes and incentives, capital controls, and convergence of growth rates. Section V concludes.\n\n",
