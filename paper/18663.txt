Revealed Preferences for Journals: Evidence from Page Limits
David Card and Stefano DellaVigna
NBER Working Paper No. 18663
December 2012
JEL No. A1
ABSTRACT
Academic journals set a variety of policies that affect the supply of new manuscripts. We study the
impact of page limit policies adopted by the American Economic Review (AER) in 2008 and the Journal
of the European Economic Association (JEEA) in 2009 in response to a substantial increase in the
length of articles in economics. We focus the analysis on the decision by potential authors to either
shorten a longer manuscript in response to the page limit, or submit to another journal. For the AER
we find little indication of a loss of longer papers – instead, authors responded by shortening the text
and reformatting their papers. For JEEA, in contrast, we estimate that the page length policy led to
nearly complete loss of longer manuscripts. These findings provide a revealed-preference measure
of competition between journals and indicate that a top-5 journal has substantial monopoly power
over submissions, unlike a journal one notch below. At both journals we find that longer papers were
more likely to receive a revise and resubmit verdict prior to page limits, suggesting that the loss of
longer papers may have had a detrimental effect on quality at JEEA. Despite a modest impact of the
AER's policy on the average length of submissions (-5%), the policy had little or no effect on the length
of final accepted manuscripts. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating editorial policies.

Introduction

Scholarly journals play a vital role in the production and diusion of scientic knowledge. Historically, these journals were the primary mode for communicating new ndings to a widely dispersed
research community.1 Although working papers, conferences, and other channels ll this function
today, journals still serve as critical arbiters of new research in most elds (McCabe and Snyder,
2005). Editors choose policies and select articles for publication: in so doing they inuence the
success or failure of competing research programs and help determine which ideas get ahead.
Despite long-standing interest by economists in knowledge production2 , and the importance
of journals in this process, there is little evidence on the ways that journals set their editorial
policies, and the impacts of these choices.3 Evaluating these policies is important because they
aect the types of papers that are published as well as the eciency of the publication process.
In this paper, we take a step toward lling this gap by studying the impacts of a specic
editorial policy — submission page limits. Disciplines dier in the typical length of published
articles. Many of the top journals in the hard sciences, including Science and Nature, impose
very short page limits. The top journals in economics used to publish relatively short articles, but
the length has grown substantially. Figure 1 plots the average length year-by-year of all articles
published from 1970 in 5 top journals, the American Economic Review, Econometrica, the Journal
of Political Economy, the Quarterly Journal of Economics, and the Review of Economic Studies.4
The page length nearly tripled from an average of 16 pages in the early 1970s to an average of
45 pages in 2011-12. The change is such that a paper in the 10th percentile of length in 2012
is longer than a paper in the 90th percentile of length in the 1970s. Furthermore, the change is
nearly identical in the ve journals. This evolution likely contributed to the decrease in the total
number of articles published in economics (DellaVigna and Card, 2013).
In light of this, it is natural to wonder whether these sharp dierences in page length standards
have any impact on the production or diusion of knowledge. While economic journals are unlikely
to switch back to a model of publishing short papers, an individual journal can move some way
by restricting the length of submitted or published papers.
Indeed, in September of 2008 the AER introduced a 40-page limit for new submissions — the
rst (and still the only) top-5 economics journal to do so.5 The new limit was signicant because
in the previous year 40% of submissions exceeded the limit.6 In March 2009 the Journal of the
European Economic Association (JEEA) adopted the same policy as the AER. Within a few
1

The earliest scientic journals were the Journal des sçavans, and the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal
Society, both established in 1655. See McClellan (1985).
2
Perhaps the best known economic research on knowledge production has focused on the patenting system: see
for example Manseld (1986) and Griliches (1998). Waldinger (2012) studies the egect of the Nazi expulsion of
Jewish faculty from German research universities, and the subsequent egects on colleague productivity.
3
There is an (interdisciplinary) body of research on two related issues: the conduct of peer review (e.g., Blank,
1991; Hamermesh, 1994; Jegerson et al., 2007, Ellison, 2002b, 2011; Chetty, Saez, and Sandor, 2012; Welch, 2012)
and citation practices (e.g., Stigler and Friedland, 1975; Laband and Tollison, 2000).
4
The measures of page length are standardized to take into account the digerent page density in the ve journals.
5
The actual limit was 40 pages for articles with 1.5 line spacing, and 50 pages for articles with 2 line spacing.
6
This percentage counts manuscripts over 50 pages if 2-spaced and over 40 pages if less than 2-spaced.

1

months JEEA abandoned the policy, but it remains in eect at the AER.
We use anonymized data on submissions to these two journals to evaluate the benets and
costs of the change, emphasizing the perspective of the journal. The envisioned benets are
shorter, more easily digested papers, and possibly a faster editorial process. As for the costs, a
simple model of author behavior suggests that the introduction of page limits will lead authors to
engage in triage: shortening manuscripts that fall below some threshold to meet the page limit,
and submitting longer papers to the next best alternative journal. The potential loss of longer
manuscripts may be a concern, particularly if these articles are of relatively high quality. Note
that an author who sends a paper elsewhere but is rejected may later decide to comply with the
page limits. Hence, we expect the loss of papers due to a newly-instituted page limit policy to be
larger in the short-run than in the medium-run.
In principle the fraction of longer papers that are shortened rather than diverted to other
journals can be estimated from the size of the spike in the distribution of manuscript lengths
under the page limit policy.7 In practice, implementation of this simple test is complicated by
variation in font size, line spacing, and margins, all of which can be manipulated to meet a given
page limit, and by the possibility of underlying trends in the rate of submission. We adopt a more
robust test based on a comparison of submission rates of shorter and longer papers. Assuming
that submission rates of both groups are aected by similar trends, and that page limit policies
have no eect on the submission rates of shorter papers, a simple dierence-in-dierences identies
the net diversion of longer papers.
A second insight from the model is that authors will be more willing to shorten a manuscript
when the gap between the expected payo from submitting to the journal in question and the
next best alternative — the surplus from the match of paper and journal — is higher. In the
limiting case where authors are close to indierent between outlets, a page limit policy will lead
to the loss of nearly all longer submissions. The rate of loss of longer papers therefore provides
revealed-preference evidence regarding the extent of competition between journals.
Hence, our analysis of the imposition of page limits serves two main purposes. First, it provides
evidence to evaluate the costs and benets of a signicant editorial shift. Second, it allows us to
infer the degree of competition for papers between dierent journals, which is hard to measure
otherwise given the lack of data on the choice of journals by authors at submission and the limited
variation in other costs of submission.8
At the AER we nd that the introduction of page limits led to a rapid fall in the number of
longer submissions and the emergence of a spike in the distribution of page lengths around the
40-page limit. To implement our dierence-in-dierences estimator, we standardize the length of
7

This idea is formally identical to the procedure suggested by Meyer and Wise (1983) for estimating the job
losses caused by the introduction of a minimum wage. See Card and Krueger (1995, pp. 223-236) for a discussion
of the limitations of this approach.
8
In principle, one could similarly estimate revealed preference using other shifts to the net benets of submission
to a journal. However, such variation is hard to come by. For example, shifts in the speed of editorial decisions
usually take place quite slow, with an even slower spread of the information. Changes in submission fees are so small
that they are unlikely to deter submissions. In contrast, the page limit policy was sudden, publicly announced, and
imposed real time costs.

all submissions using detailed data on font size, line spacing, and margins. We then compare
submission rates of shorter papers (30 standardized pages or less) versus longer papers (31 or
more standardized pages), on the assumption that any shortened paper will be at least 31 pages
in length. Our preferred estimates suggest that there was no loss of longer papers at the AER,
and rule out a loss larger than 8% at standard signicance levels. Interpreting these ndings
in light of our model, our ‘worst case’ estimates suggest that a typical author was willing to
shorten her paper by at least 22 pages to meet the AER’s guidelines, implying that the AER is
signicantly dierentiated from the best alternative option for most authors. The nding of no
loss of manuscripts at the short horizon of one year is signicant because the losses, if any, are
likely to be larger in the short-run than in the medium-run.
Given the uncertainty in this estimate, it is also important to consider the risk involved — if
some longer papers were lost, were they of higher or lower quality, or from particular elds? We
use the likelihood of a revise—and—resubmit verdict as an indicator of quality. Perhaps surprisingly,
we nd that prior to the policy, longer papers had a higher success rate than shorter papers: a
paper of 50+ pages was 15 percentage points more likely to receive a revise—and—resubmit verdict
than one shorter than 40 pages.9 A similar pattern was true at JEEA, where we also measure
the number of citations received by submitted manuscripts (regardless of publication status) and
nd that longer manuscripts have more citations on average.
Field-wise we nd that the policy had the largest impact on empirical microeconomics (i.e.,
public, labor, micro-development, and law-and-economics): prior to the policy change 51% of
empirical micro submissions were 41 pages or longer, versus 42% of all manuscripts that can
be assigned to a eld. Interestingly, this is the eld for which we see the largest decrease in
the number of longer papers after the policy change (-7%), though the relative change is not
signicantly dierent than for most other elds.
While our modeling framework addresses the potential costs of a page limit policy, we also
examine the potential benets. We nd that the AER’s policy led to a 4 page shortening of the
average submitted manuscript. Some of this change was due to an increase in density: standardizing for format changes, the page limit policy was associated with a more modest 2-page
reduction in length, a roughly 5% decrease. The main cuts occurred in the length of appendices
submitted for publication (shorter by 1.5 pages) and tables and gures (shorter by 0.5 pages),
with no change in the (standardized) number of pages of basic text.
Looking at nal accepted manuscripts, however, we nd little impact on length, especially
when we consider an expanded sample covering a longer pre- and post-period. Closer examination
shows that prior to the policy manuscripts invited for revision were typically shortened by about
2 pages over the course of the revision process, whereas under the new regime nal accepted
manuscripts were about the same length as initial submissions. Despite the negligible eect on
published manuscripts, the reduction in average length of submissions may have reduced the
burden on referees and editors. We lack data on handling times for the AER. For JEEA, however,
we nd suggestive evidence that shorter papers lead to faster editorial decisions. We instead nd
9

This nding seems contrary to a warning posted on the AER submission page in the period before 2008,
suggesting that longer papers were unlikely to be published.

no evidence that page limits reduce the number of rounds of revision.
Overall, this evidence suggests that there was a small but signicant shortening of papers
submitted to the AER, if not of the published ones. In the short-run, this reduction must have
taken the form of shortening of existing papers. But in the medium-run, did the policy lead
economists to write shorter papers? We provide suggestive evidence using a sample of NBER
working papers written from 2007 to 2012. We nd no evidence of a decrease in page length, or
of an increase in papers exactly 39-41 pages long, following the AER page limit policy.
The introduction of page limits had a much dierent impact at the Journal of the European
Economic Association. After the policy was introduced there was no spike in the number of
submissions close to the page limit. Rather, our estimates suggest that the page limit policy
caused a loss of virtually all longer submissions — a pattern that led the JEEA editorial team to
reverse the policy. The high loss rate suggests that potential submitters perceived relatively small
match surpluses at JEEA, and were unwilling to shorten their papers. The sharp contrast between
the reactions of authors to the same page limit policies at the AER and the JEEA underscores
the dierences in market constraints faced by the two journals.
A rst implication of our results is the importance of the evaluation of editorial policies. At one
journal (AER), the editorial policy that we evaluate came at little or no cost, but it yielded few
(if any) benets. At the second journal (JEEA), the policy achieved its benet, but at high costs.
The policies also had distributional impacts, aecting some elds, like applied microeconomics,
more than others. These ndings can inform the design of editorial policies. For example, an
alternative policy might focus on the length of accepted manuscripts, and devote special attention
to the risk of losing longer submissions.
As such, this paper contributes to a small existing literature on editorial policies. Existing
studies mostly focus on the referee process, including the impact of double-blind reports (Blank,
1991) and the use of deadlines and social incentives for referees (Chetty, Saez, and Sandor, 2012).
Journals set a number of other policies, from length of the appointment of editors to the posting
of the data for replication, most of which are, as far as we know, untested.10
A second implication is for our understanding of the industrial organization of academic journals. Using a reveled preference measure–the willingness to shorten longer papers–we provide a
measure of the average match surplus associated with submission to a given journal. Our ndings
suggests that the traditional top-5 journals in economics provide a relatively high match surplus
for most authors and face relatively inelastic supplies of manuscripts, whereas journals just outside
the top-5 provide much lower surplus and face highly elastic supplies.
Finally, this paper oers an interesting perspective on the ongoing debate about the generalizability of reduced form policy evaluations (e.g., Deaton, 2009; Imbens, 2010). We nd that
the same policy at two dierent journals had very dierent impacts, underscoring the value of
multiple case studies or other sources of design variation when the eect of the policy of interest
depends on latent structural parameters that vary from case to case.

Brogaard, Engelberg, and Parsons (forthcoming) examine the impact of conict of interest of editors handling
papers by colleagues.

A Model of Submission Behavior

Consider the author of a paper of length q who is considering whether to submit to journal l
which has a page limit policy, or one of an alternative set of journals which do not. Denote by Ym
the expected payo from submitting to journal m> which includes both the payo if the paper is
ultimately accepted in the journal and the continuation value of an optimal strategy if the paper
is rejected. Since we cannot separate these dierent components, we consider the total expected
payo Ym = Submission to a journal m 6= l entails no extra cost, but submission to journal l with
page limits induces cost f (q) of shortening the paper to the page limit qS O . We assume that
f (q) = 0 for q  qS O > and that f (q) is positive and strictly increasing for q A qS O =11
Dene Y3l  maxm6=l Ym as the author’s next best alternative. Then she submits to journal l
if and only if
(1)
Vl = Yl  Y3l  f(q)>

where Vl is the surplus associated with match between the paper and journal l. In the absence
of page limits all papers with Vl  0 are submitted. In the presence of page limits, however, an
author will only submit if the match surplus exceeds the shortening cost. This leads to a cuto
threshold qW (Vl ) = f31 [Vl ], such that if q  qW (Vl ) the author shortens the paper and submits it,
while if q A qW (Vl ) she submits the paper (as is) to the next best outlet. Since f (q) is increasing,
the threshold qW (Vl ) is higher for papers with higher match surplus.
Suppose that there is a distribution of authors with papers ready for submission drawn from
some bivariate distribution for q and Vl . In the case of no page limits, we observe the distribution
of papers with a positive match value at journal l. Once page limits are introduced, however,
only authors with Vl A f (q) submit to the journal. Among papers with q  qS O the policy has
no eect, so the conditional distribution of page lengths for papers shorter than qS O is the same
as in the absence of page limits= Among longer papers, a fraction is shortened, creating a spike in
the distribution of page lengths at qS O , while the remainder are lost to other outlets.
One particularly simple version of this model arises when Vl is the same for all authors. In
this case, the threshold qW is the same for all authors, and journal l loses all papers longer than
qW , and retains all papers shorter than qW = Figure 2a illustrates the eect of a page limit policy
on the observed distribution of submitted paper lengths in the case where Vl A f (q) for all q. In
this case, journal l does not lose any papers: the upper tail of paper lengths is transformed into a
spike at exactly qS O = The opposite extreme is illustrated by Figure 2b. In this case, Vl ? f (q) for
all papers with q A qS O (i.e., qW = qS O ). This can happen if there is a relatively high xed cost
of editing papers, and if the surplus match value associated with journal l is small. In this case,
the entire right tail of the distribution of page length disappears, resulting in a higher density of
shorter papers among the papers submitted.
More generally, we might expect some combination of compliance with the page length policy,
leading to a spike in submissions at qS O pages, and diversion of papers to other outlets, causing
a reduction in the inow of submissions in the upper tail of page lengths. Depending on how
11

The cost may include a xed cost I of any shortening, which implies that f (q) < I as q approaches qS O from
above.

5

page lengths and the journal-specic match surplus are distributed across authors and elds, the
policy may cause a dierential loss of papers in certain elds, or from certain groups of authors.
Finally, the model indicates that the potential loss of manuscripts to journal l is likely to
be higher in the short-run than in the medium-run. Following the imposition of page limits, an
author may decide to send the paper to journal m rather than journal l= If the paper is, however,
rejected by journal m> the relative surplus Vl to submission to journal l is now higher given that
the set of alternative journals no longer includes m, and the author may decide to shorten the
paper and submit to journal l. Hence, a journal which imposes page limits is likely to recover
over the medium-run some of the manuscripts lost initially.

Page Length Policies and Data

We study the impact of page limit policies introduced at the AER in 2008, and at JEEA in 2009.
We begin by describing these policy changes.
AER Page Limit Policy. Figure 3a presents a simplied timeline of the main editorial
policy changes at the AER between 2007 and 2010. We constructed this timeline using information contained in snapshots of the AER website from past years12 and correspondence with the
managing editor, Steven Stelling, and the editor at the time, Robert Mott.
In the years up to and including, 2007, the AER attempted to discourage longer submissions,
but had no formal page length policy. The instructions on the submission page as of 2007 suggested that authors submit papers in double-spaced format using a 12 point type, and added that
‘Manuscripts longer than 50 pages are rarely accepted for publication’.
A sterner warning that ‘Manuscripts should not exceed 50 pages’ was added in April 2008;
however, this page limit was not enforced by the AER editorial oce. Other guidelines concerning
font size and double-spacing were left unchanged.
In August of 2008 Robert Mott, concerned about the expanding length of manuscripts
published by the AER, instructed the sta to enforce the existing page limit of 50 pages (for
double-spaced manuscripts). Following correspondence between the editors, a new policy with
explicit page limits was posted in September 2008. The key parts read:
‘READ GUIDELINES THOROUGHLY. PAPERS WILL NOT BE REVIEWED IF THEY
DO NOT FOLLOW STYLE GUIDELINES.
Papers should be submitted electronically to http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/aer
Upon receipt of the paper, a conrmation email will be sent electronically. The submission is
not complete if a conrmation email has not been received.
1.
All manuscripts must be formatted with 1.5 line spacing and must not exceed 40 pages
(50-page limit applies to double-spaced manuscripts). This limit includes reference lists, gures,
and tables.
2.
Manuscripts must use 12-point font. Margins must be one inch top, bottom, and sides.
Please use Times New Roman or similar font. These font, margin, and line-spacing requirements

also apply to reference lists and tables.
3.
You must include the words “Not for Publication” at the beginning of any lengthy appendix. The 40-page limit can be exceeded by an appendix if it is clearly marked as such.’
On September 29, 2008, the AER editorial oce sent an email to all AEA members informing
of the new policy, and stating that the policy applied to all AEA journals, including the AER and
the four American Economic Journals.13 Two weeks later, another email claried that the editors
of the American Economic Journals would be ‘exible with regard to page length limitations’, but
stating that ‘the American Economic Review, however, will be strictly enforcing the 40-page (1.5
line spacing) limit.’ After this date, there were no major changes to the page limit policy until
July 1, 2011, when the guideline for margin spacing was changed from 1 inch to 1.5 inches.
To summarize, between July and September 2008 the AER introduced a strict page limit
policy that has remained in place since. At the same time, it also shifted the default for the
spacing of submissions from double spacing to 1.5 spacing (though double-spacing was allowed),
and imposed a strict 12 point font size requirement. To deal with the line spacing and font size
changes that occurred at the same time as the page length policy we develop a standardizing
procedure, explained below, which translates the length of manuscripts (submitted before and
after the policy change) to a ‘standardized length’, assuming 1.5 spacing and 12 point font.
In order to study the impact of the page limit policy, we collected data on submissions in the
year before and the year after the change. Following a suggestion by the managing editor, we
omit the transition period from July 1, 2008 to September 30, 2008, and focus on manuscripts
submitted from July 1, 2007 to June 30, 2008 (the ”pre” period with no page limits) and from
October 1, 2008 to September 30, 2009 (the ”post” period of page limits). Submissions throughout
were made electronically through the Manuscript Central system, which the AER adopted in
July 2007. With the permission of American Economic Association Executive Council, we hired
a temporary worker at the AER oce in Pittsburgh to code information on the 2,868 newly
submitted manuscripts during our two-year sample period, 1,406 in the pre-page limit period and
1,462 in the post- period.14 (We discuss the data collected on each manuscript in more detail
below). We also collected data on the nal versions of manuscripts submitted during our sample
period that were ultimately accepted for publication by July, 2012 for a total of 217 manuscripts.
JEEA Page Limit Policy. Figure 3b presents a timeline of the changes taking place at
JEEA between 2007 and 2010. Until March 2009, JEEA did not have specic restrictions on
the submission of new manuscripts, other than the required language (English) and the format
of submission (electronic). In March 2009, the editors–Fabrizio Zilibotti (managing editor),
13

This email said: ‘Dear Authors: The AEA’s peer-reviewed journals (The American Economic Review and the
four American Economic Journals) have recently made changes to the guidelines for the submission of manuscripts.
In particular, we have changed our formatting requirements and our page limit. All manuscripts must be formatted
with 1.5 line spacing and should not exceed 40 pages (a 50-page limit applies to double-spaced manuscripts). Manuscripts must use 12-point font. Margins must be one inch at the top, bottom, and sides. Please use Times New
Roman or a similar font. These font, margin, and line-spacing requirements also apply to reference lists and tables.
Papers will not be sent out for review if they do not follow these guidelines. [...]’.
14
We drop 21 manuscripts which are errors in submissions, trials in the transition to the Editorial Express system,
or otherwise not real papers.

Marios Angeletos, Orazio Attanasio, and Fabio Canova–decided to introduce a page limit policy
modelled on the AER policy. In particular, the submission policy introduced on March 25,
2009 stated: ‘JEEA has introduced a new guideline that applies to ALL SUBMISSIONS and
RESUBMISSIONS. All manuscripts must be formatted with 1.5 line spacing and should not exceed
40 pages (a 50-page limit applies to double-spaced manuscripts) — including gures, tables and
references. Manuscripts must use 12-point font. Margins must be one inch at the top, bottom,
and sides. Please use Times New Roman or a similar font. These fonts, margins, and line-spacing
requirements also apply to reference lists and tables. Manuscripts that exceed this length will be
automatically returned by the editorial oce to authors with request to make changes so as to
abide by the guideline before they can be sent to referees.’
In June of 2009, two months after the introduction of the policy, the editorial team (at that
point including Stefano DellaVigna, who had replaced Orazio Attanasio) became concerned that
the page limit policy was hurting the number of submissions. Following an internal debate,
enforcement of the page length policy halted on July 8, 2009, and the policy was removed from
the website on August 5, 2009.
To study the impact of the JEEA policy we collected data on all submissions for a period of
15 months before the introduction of the policy (January 1, 2008 to March 24, 2009); for the 3.5
months period during which the page limit policy was in place (March 25, 2009 to July 8, 2009);
and for approximately nine months following the ocial removal of the page limit (August 5, 2009
to March 31, 2010). As in our analysis of the AER policy change, we omit the transitional period
from July 8, 2009 to August 5, 2009. Submissions to JEEA were made electronically through
Editorial Express. Our sample contains 883 newly submitted manuscripts, of which 95 were
submitted during the period of the page limit policy. We also collected Google Scholar citations
for all JEEA submissions (whether rejected or not)15 , and information on the number of days
between the rst submission and the initial editorial decision.
Data Collection and Measures of Length. In the absence of a page limit, authors may
select a format for readability or convenience, choosing (for example) a large font size, or simply
the default settings in their word processing package. After a page limit is introduced, however,
authors have an incentive to increase the density of material in a page. Moreover, at both the AER
and JEEA, the introduction of a page length policy coincided with a restatement of the default
formatting for submissions. Author responses to both changes make it dicult to measure the
eects of the policy change using only information on the page lengths of manuscripts.
Following a pilot test, we developed a procedure to collect information on the formatting of
manuscripts which would allow the construction of a ‘standardized’ manuscript length. Specically, we measured the following variables (Detailed instructions are in the Appendix):
- Number of pages. We record separately the number of pages of text and references, the
number of pages of tables and gures (when not embedded in the text), the number of pages of

- Font. We record the font size used in the main text using an Acrobat function.16
- Margins. We record all four margins using an Acrobat function.
- Lines per page. Since it was not possible to accurately measure line spacing, we record the
number of lines in a full page of text, and use it to infer the line spacing. In case there is no full
page of text in a document we record an estimate of the number of lines that would be included
in a full page.
-Are Tables in the text? We record whether any tables or gures are embedded in the text.
- Number of characters per page and per line. We record the number of characters in a full
page, as well as the number of characters in a full line.
Data collection, which took 5-8 minutes per manuscript, was done by a temporary worker at
the AER oce, and a team of research assistants working at Berkeley (for JEEA coding). The
data collection team also recorded the submission date, the editor, the editorial decision, and any
JEL codes submitted by authors.
These detailed measures of formatting allow us to conduct a variety of accuracy checks. For
example, we compare the number of characters in a line to an estimate based on font size and
margins. Appendix Figure 1a shows a scatterplot of the two measures for AER submissions. The
two are highly correlated, with a correlation coecient of 0.78; the correlation in the JEEA sample
is similarly high at 0.84. We likewise compare the number of characters per page to a prediction
based on the estimated number of characters per line (using font size and margin information)
and the number of lines in a page. Appendix Figure 1b shows a scatterplot of the two measures,
which have a correlation coecient of 0.96 in both the AER and JEEA data sets. These reliability
checks were also used to detect and correct errors in data coding.
Appendix Table 1 presents an overview of our data set. In the absence of page limits submissions to the AER were a little longer (mean=38 pages) than submissions to the JEEA (mean=36
pages). Under the page limit policy, submissions to both journals were shortened by about 4
pages (AER mean=34 pages; JEEA mean=32 pages).

Eect of Page Limits on Submissions. As a point of departure Figure 4a presents a simple
comparison of the distributions of page lengths among manuscripts submitted to the AER in the
year before and the year after the introduction of the page limit policy. In this gure we dene
manuscript length to include text, tables, gures and any appendices submitted for publication,
but exclude cover page(s) or online appendices. Note that in the pre-page limit period, long
papers were common, with 44 percent of manuscripts longer than 40 pages, and 15 percent longer
than 50 pages. As expected, in the post-page limit period only 3 percent of papers are longer than
50 pages, indicating a small number of exceptions to the stated length policy. Interestingly, the
number of 41-50 page manuscripts also declines very substantially, reecting the fact that most
16

In a small number of cases (20) this function did not work properly and we use an imputation of font size.

authors adhered to the 40-page limit for 1.5-spaced manuscripts, rather than the 50-page limit
for double-spaced papers. There is also a large spike of submissions at 39-40 pages, representing
21 percent of submissions in the page limit period, compared to just 6 percent in the pre-page
limit period. This spike suggests that many authors reformatted or shortened their papers to
submit to the AER in the post-page-limit period. Exactly what fraction actually shortened their
paper, versus simply reformatting it, is less clear, because font sizes, margins and line spacing
characteristics all changed with the page limit policy, as we document below.
Figure 4b presents a corresponding gure based on a length measure that includes online appendices and the cover page. For the pre-period, the distribution of manuscript lengths is similar
whether we include or exclude online appendices, reecting the relatively low use of such appendices. In the post period, however, online appendices become more common, and their inclusion
changes the visual impression of the policy eect. The spike at 39-40 pages is signicantly smaller
in Figure 4b than Figure 4a, and there is less indication of a decline in the fraction of manuscripts
longer than 50 pages. This pattern suggests that some of the material in longer papers was moved
to online appendices, as allowed by the page length policy.
An obvious concern with the simple contrasts in Figures 4a and 4b is that there could be
underlying trends in submission behavior that confound the pre/post comparison. To address
this concern, Figure 5 presents event-study-style plots of the number of submissions per month in
dierent length categories before and after the introduction of the page limit policy.17 The total
number of submissions per month, shown in the top line of the gure, is relatively stable over our
2-year sample period at around 120 per month. Importantly, there is no evidence of a decline
in the total number of submissions after the introduction of page limits, as would be expected if
a signicant number of longer papers were diverted to other outlets. The introduction of page
limits did lead to a sizeable fall ( 60%) in the number of submissions  42 pages, accompanied
by a rise in the number of papers around the limit (39-41 pages). Both of these shifts appear to
have been fully realized by the rst month of full implementation of the policy in October 2008.
The page limit policy was also associated with a rise in the number of papers of length  38
pages. In the absence of formatting changes, one might not have expected a 40-page limit to aect
the number of submissions  38 pages. In fact, manuscript formatting changed substantially after
the introduction of page limits, leading to a rise in the number of papers under the 40 page limit.
For example, an author with a double-spaced manuscript of 42 pages of text who simply switched
to 1.5 spacing would end up submitting a 32 page paper.18
Figures 6a-6d document the formatting changes the introduction of the page limit policy. In
the pre- period, the modal line spacing (Figure 6a) was double-spacing, as required by the AER
submission rules; still, more than half of the submissions used a line spacing  1=5= In the postpage limit period, only about 10 percent of submissions are double-spaced, and the modal spacing
is 1.5. Interestingly, while single-spaced manuscripts are rare in the post-period, 20-30 percent of

that we did not measure manuscript length for the transitional period from July to September of 2008.

density.

submissions use line spacing of 1.2-1.3, a form of cheating that allows authors to cram additional
material into the 40 page limit. We also observe a shift in margin spacing (Figure 6b), with a
tendency for narrower margins after the introduction of page limits. As with line spacing, there
is some evidence of cheating in the post-period, with 13 percent of manuscripts having margins
1.8 inches total. Figure 6c shows more modest changes in font size, with some convergence to
a 12 point font after the page limit policy was introduced, though still about 10% of submissions
in the post-period use an 11 point font.19
As an overall measure of the manuscript density, we use the number of characters (including
spaces) in a full page of text.20 As shown in Figure 6d, the page limit policy led to a sharp increase
in manuscript density, with a rise in the modal number of characters per page from around 2,000
(the expected density in a double-spaced 12 point font paper) to 2,800 ( the expected density for
a 1.5-spaced document using 12 point font). Thirteen percent of manuscripts submitted in the
post period have A3000 characters/page, substantially more than technically permissible under
the page limit policy.
We use our estimate of characters per page to construct a standardized measure of length,
assuming 2,550 characters per page — the average density for a paper formatted at 1.5 spacing
with 12 point font and 1” margins.21 Specically, we compute standardized length = actual length
× characters per page@2550, rounded to the nearest integer. We then add the number of pages
of tables and gures, plus any pages of appendix materials that are included for publication, plus
any abstract or title pages.
Figure 7 shows the distribution of standardized page lengths before and after the policy change.
Compared to the pre- period, the post- period has fewer longer papers and more papers of intermediate length (30-45 pages). There is also a small decrease in the number of papers between 20
and 25 pages, oset by a small rise in the number between 26 and 30 pages. Compared to the
distribution of unadjusted page lengths (Figure 4a), the spike at 40 pages is no longer visible in
the standardized distribution, reecting the wide variation in page densities among submissions
of 39-40 pages.
As noted earlier, changes in the density of papers mean that we cannot infer the relative
number of longer papers that were shortened versus diverted to other journals simply from the
before- and after-distributions of page lengths. Instead, we build on the analysis in Figure 5 and
compare the numbers of shorter and longer submissions per week before and after the introduction
of page limits. Under the assumption that submission rates would trend together in the absence
of any policy change, and that submissions of shorter papers are unaected by the policy, a simple
dierence in dierences allows us to infer the change in the number of longer papers caused by
the policy.
19

Our understanding is that, while the AER stag monitored the length of each manuscript submitted and returned
to the authors papers with egregious violations, it did not attempt to enforce the rules for relatively small formatting
violations.
20
As noted in Appendix Figure 1b, this measure is very highly correlated with an estimate based on characters
per line and number of lines per page.
21
Assuming 91.5 characters per line times and 31 lines per page, and allowing a ten percent reduction for half-lines
and other features of a typical manuscript, yields a density of 2,550 characters/page.

11

We use a threshold of 30 standardized pages to classify shorter ( 30 pages) and longer (A 30)
papers. We adopt a relatively low threshold to minimize the change of counting as short papers
submissions which, before our reformatting, were aected by the page limit policy. Among the 361
papers submitted in the post-limit period with a length of 39-41 pages (i.e., papers at the spike),
only 5 have a standardized length of 30 pages or less, so we believe the number of submissions
with  30 standardized pages is unlikely to have been much aected by the page length policies.22

Figure 8 presents a scatter plot of the number of submissions of shorter and longer papers
for each week in the pre-page limit year (blue circles) and in the page limit year (red squares).
We also show the predicted number of longer submissions, based on the relationship between
short and long submissions in the pre-period. The post-observations are if anything scattered
somewhat above the predicted line, providing no evidence of a relative loss in longer submissions.
To obtain a point estimate of the loss of longer manuscripts, we estimate the following
dierence-in-dierence specication
qO>w  qV>w =  + gS O>w + %w >

(2)

where qO>w is a measure (in levels or logs) of the number of longer submissions in week w, qV>w
is the number of shorter submissions in the same week, and the indicator variable gS O>w is equal
to 1 for observations in the page length regime, and 0 otherwise. The coecient  measures the
relative change in the number of longer versus shorter submissions in the post-period.
The underlying components of this dierence in dierences are presented in Table 1. Comparing columns 1 and 3 (or 2 and 4), there was essentially no change in the number of shorter
papers submitted per week following the adoption of the page limit policy by the AER (e.g., the
number of submissions per week was 10.21 in the pre-period and 10.02 in the post period). By
comparison, the number of longer manuscripts submitted per week actually increased slightly,
from 16.79 to 18.10, leading to a dierence in dierences of b = 1=50 manuscripts per week, with
a standard error of 1.05. Relative to the pre-policy submission rate of 16.8 per week, this implies
an 8.9% increase in longer submissions (standard error=6.3%). Using the logarithm of weekly
submissions the implied dierence of dierences is slightly larger (14.0%).
A possible concern with these estimates is that the number of submissions per week is serially
correlated, leading an OLS procedure to understate the standard error of the estimated dierence
in dierences. In fact, the residuals from equation (2) are essentially uncorrelated (e.g., rst
order serial correlation = -0.01; second order correlation = -0.01) so quasi-dierencing the data
to remove serial correlation and re-estimating leads to an estimated coecient and standard error
that are essentially identical to the corresponding OLS estimates.
While the point estimates suggest that the AER’s page limit policy had no negative eect on
submissions of longer papers, the relatively large sampling error means we can only rule estimates
of  smaller than -0.6 papers per week, a worst case loss of 2.2% of the total weekly submission
ow. In the context of the ”common surplus” version of our model in which all manuscripts longer
22

Only 1% are $ 30 standardized pages, but 12% are $ 35 pages in standardized length, suggesting that formatting
changes could exert some egect on submissions in the 31-35 page range.

12

than qW are diverted to other outlets, note that this worst-case loss implies:
1  I (qW ) = 0=022>
where I is the distribution of pre-policy page lengths. Using the observed distribution we infer
qW = I 31 (1  0=022) = 65 sdjhv=
Thus the data suggest that a typical author considering submitting a paper to the AER would
be willing to cut at least 25 pages to comply with the limit, and more likely up to any number
of pages.23
We investigate the robustness of our estimate in a series of alternative specications shown in
Table 2. The top row shows our baseline dierence-in-dierence estimate of 1.50 longer papers
per week. In row 2 we present a quasi-dierenced specication in which we include the number
of shorter papers submitted in a week as a control variable with an unrestricted coecient (rather
than assume a coecient of 1.0 as in the baseline model).24 The estimated coecient on shorter
papers is 0.24 (standard error=0.12) which is far from 1. Nevertheless, the estimated eect of the
page length policy on longer papers is similar to the baseline estimate, at 1.35. In row 3 we add a
linear trend to the quasi-dierenced model, allowing dierent long run trends in submission rates
of shorter and longer papers. The estimated trend coecient is close to 0, and this specication
yields a point estimate quite close to our baseline.
Finally, in row 4 we shift the threshold for dening shorter and longer papers from 30 to 35
standardized pages. As noted above, there is some evidence that formatting changes alone could
lead to an increase in the number of papers in the 31-35 (standardized) page range. In any case,
the number of papers in this range rises relatively fast, and moving these papers from the ”longer”
group to the ”shorter” group causes the estimate of  to fall to -1.35 papers/week, implying a
modest diversion of longer papers away from the AER (a net loss of 5% of total submissions).
Interpreting this point estimate in terms of a common surplus version of our model, we would
infer an estimate for the triage threshold of
qW = I 31 (1  0=05) = 58 sdjhv>
and a worst-case lower bound of qW = 51 pages.25 Based on the overall evidence, however,
we suspect that an estimate of -1.35 for the loss of longer papers is too negative, and that
estimates based on comparisons of papers  30 pages and A 30 pages are more likely to be
correct. Nevertheless, the sensitivity of our estimated impact of the policy has to be taken into
consideration.
23

This lower bound makes no allowance for the imprecision of the 0.978 quantile. A simple way to include
this factor is to nd the lower bound of the 95% condence interval for the 0.978 quantile, using Woodrug’s
approximation, which Sitter and Wu (2001) shows works reasonably well. The Woodrug lower bound for the 0.978
condence interval in the distribution of pre-policy page lengths is 62 pages.
24
I.e., we estimate qO>w =  + gS rvw>w + qV>w + %w =
25
The lower bound digerence in digerences is 31=35 3 2 × 1=06 = 33=47 longer papers/week, which is a 12.85%
reduction in total submissions. The 0.875 percentile of page lengths in the pre-period is 51 pages. Allowing for
estimation error in the quantile itself would further lower the lower bound estimate to 49 pages.

13

Our preferred estimate is that page limits caused little or no loss of papers at the AER. Yet we
cannot reject a small loss of longer papers, and an alternative specication suggests a modest loss.
If there was any loss, what types of papers were more likely to be diverted to other journals? One
important characteristic is the quality of papers, which we measure by whether a paper receives
a revise-and-resubmit decision. Figure 9a shows a non-parametric regression of the revise-andresubmit indicator on the number of (standardized) pages among papers submitted prior to the
page limit policy. The Figure provides strong evidence that the quality of papers monotonically
increases with the number of pages. Indeed, 20% of the 221 papers longer than 50 (normalized)
pages received a revise-and-resubmit decision, compared to only 6.9% of the 1,185 papers shorter
than 50 pages. Hence, any loss of longer papers could have negative impact on quality.
A second measure of quality of manuscripts is the number of citations. While we do not
have access to citation information for the AER, we obtained Google Scholar citations for all the
manuscripts submitted to JEEA. Limiting attention to papers submitted to JEEA in the periods
with no page limits, Figure 9b plots a local polynomial regression of the number of citations
as a function of the normalized paper length. The number of citations is generally increasing
in the length of the manuscript. The average citation count for the 87 papers longer than 50
(standardized) pages is 12.6, compared to 7.3 for the 636 papers shorter than 50 pages, conrming
that longer manuscripts are on average more important contributions.
We also examine the impact of the page limit policy across dierent elds. Specically,
we used the (up to 3) JEL codes provided by authors to count the number of submissions in
8 subelds: theory; laboratory experiments; macroeconomics (including international macro);
applied microeconomics (public economics, labor, micro-development, and law and economics);
industrial organization; econometrics; and all other elds.26 This analysis does not include the
25% of submissions which do not report the JEL code. (Papers can be counted in up to 3 of these
categories, depending on the number of JEL codes provided). We then conducted a dierence-indierence analysis similar to Table 1 by subeld.
The results are summarized in Table 3. The rst two rows show the average weekly submission
rate by eld (in the year before the page length policy) and the fraction of submissions longer
than 40 pages. There are substantial dierences across elds in their submission rates to the
AER, and in the length of typical papers. Theory, macroeconomics, and applied micro together
represent over 3/4 of all submissions, while econometrics, nance, and lab experiments account
for relatively few papers. Papers in empirical micro are relatively long (mean length of 51 pages
in the pre-period) while lab-based experimental papers are relatively short (32 pages). Across
all elds but macro there was a general increase in overall submissions to the AER in the year
after the page length policy was introduced. More importantly for our purposes, in all elds
except applied econometrics and econometrics there was a larger increase in the submission rate
of longer papers than shorter papers. The relatively large loss of longer papers in empirical micro
is noteworthy because this was the eld that submitted the longest papers prior to the policy.
26

We assign the elds using JEL codes as follows: theory=D,C7; laboratory experiments=C9; macroeconomics=E, F, I, O4, O5, O11; applied micro=H, I, J, K, and O except O4, O5, O11; IO=L; econometrics=C,
except C7 and C9.

14

We cannot reject, however, that the dierence in dierences for empirical micro is the same as for
any of the other elds.
Benets of Page Limits. So far, we have evaluated the potential costs for a journal in
imposing page limits. We now turn to estimating the benets of imposing page limits. Recall
that the main motivation for the page limit policy was to shorten the length of papers published
by the AER. Possible secondary benets include making submitted papers easier to read and
reducing the handling time for reaching an initial editorial decision.
In Panel A of Table 4 we compare the average length (excluding online appendices) of all
new manuscripts submitted in the year before and after the page limit introduction. The average
manuscript is shorter in the post period by 3.9 pages, about 10 percent of the initial length,
a dierence which is statistically signicant. The dierence is about the same in a regressionadjusted comparison which controls for editor xed eects and for 8 eld xed eects, as reported
in the last column. However, this comparison does not take into account changes in density of
the text. When we use the standardized page length measure, the shortening of papers is reduced
to 1.6 pages (2.2 pages regression-adjusted), a little less than 5 percent of the initial length.
Which portions of a paper change in length? The next rows in Panel A show that the page
limit policy did not lead to any shortening in the number of pages of text, but led to a half-a-page
reduction in the number of pages of tables and gures. The biggest change, however, took place in
the length of appendices, which decreased from 4 to 2.5 pages. The shorter published appendices
were more than compensated by longer online appendices which went from 0.6 pages to 3 pages.
Hence, the page limit policy led to a modest shortening of submitted papers, especially in the
published appendices. But what about the papers which end up being published? Panel B displays
the length of the nal accepted version of manuscripts which receive a revise-and-resubmit, or are
accepted upon rst submission.27 In this sample of 224 papers, we nd no statistical evidence of
a dierence in manuscript length in the pre- and post- period, though the point estimates suggest
a small reduction caused by the policy of 0.7 pages (1.8 pages when regression-adjusted).
To check the robustness of this conclusion, in Panel C we extend the sample of accepted papers
by including submissions which received a revise and resubmit from January 2006 to June 2007
and were accepted between July 2007 and June 2012. (Papers accepted before July 2007 are not
included in the AER’s Manuscript Central database and cannot be tracked). We also include
submissions from October 2009 to September 2010 that received a revise and resubmit and were
accepted by June 2012. In this extended sample of 429 papers, we conrm the main nding that
the (standardized) length of published papers remained nearly unchanged after the introduction
of page limits, with an estimated shortening of only 0.7 pages (after regression adjustment).
One of the reasons for the smaller eect on accepted papers is that, while submitted papers
became shorter in the revision process in the pre-policy period (-2.2 standardized pages), with
the policy in place the revision process has essentially no net eect on manuscript length (+0.3
standardized pages). (This nding is muted in the smaller sample of Panel B.)
To put such changes in length in perspective, Figure 1 shows the average normalized length
27

This sample does not include all papers which receive an R&R because about 10 percent of the papers which
received an R&R were ultimately rejected and another 10 percent have not been accepted by June 2012.

year-by-year of papers published in top-5 journals in economics since 1970. The page length of
each paper is normalized by the average page density in that journal divided by 2,550, the page
density for a 1.5-spaced manuscript compliant with the AER page limits. (See the Appendix
for details) The graph shows an increase in length for the top-5 journals of 30 pages from 1970
to 2012, with a change of 12 pages between 2002 and 2012. Compared to this recent increase,
the estimated impact of page limits of less than 1 page is small. The graph also shows that
papers in the American Economic Review showed a similar increase, with a somewhat lower level
given the dedicated section of short papers. In the years 2010-12, when papers published are
presumably aected by the page limit, page length increases except for a quite sharp drop in
2011. This decrease, however, is likely due to a major change in formatting with signicantly
lower page density. While we attempt to adjust for page density, our adjustment is likely to be
overcorrecting in this case (and hence generating the jump) given that the page reformat was
unlikely to have aected gures and tables as much. (Our main measure of page length does not
suer from this problem since we measure in much higher detail page length of each paper.) We
conclude that the page limit policy did not have much eect on the length of published papers.
Finally, it is possible that, while not aecting the length of accepted papers much, the page
limit made the revision process faster. In the bottom row of Panel B we measure the number
of rounds of revision required for acceptance of a paper in the baseline sample28 . We nd no
evidence of such shortening in the revision process after adjusting for editor xed eects.
Overall, the AER’s limit policy did not succeed in signicantly reducing the length of published
papers, or in reducing the duration of the revision process for accepted papers. Nevertheless,
it is possible that the policy reduced the burden on referees and editors by making it easier to
adjudicate initial submissions. While we do not have access to data on decision times at the AER,
we do observe decision times at the Journal of the European Economic Association. Figure 9c
shows a non-parametric regression of time to initial decision on (standardized) paper length, using
data from JEEA. Longer papers are associated with longer decision times, though we hesitate to
draw a causal conclusion on the eect of page length, since it is possible that if the same paper
were made shorter it would have been even harder to adjudicate.
Short-run versus Medium-run. So far we have side-stepped the distinction between shortrun and medium-run responses to the policy change. In the short-run, the latent distribution of
page length is given; authors of longer papers intending to submit to the AER have no choice but
to shorten their papers. But in the medium run, authors planning to submit to the AER may
decide to write shorter papers to start with, presumably at a lower cost compared to shortening
an existing draft. In addition, authors of longer papers may have decided in the short-run to send
the paper elsewhere but, if rejected, they may ultimately nd it optimal to shorten the paper and
submit to the AER. On both grounds, we expect a larger impact of page limits in the short-run
than in the medium-run. This makes the result of no page loss over the relatively short one-year
period quite striking evidence of the large surplus the AER oers in the eyes of the authors.
28

We do not produce this statistic for the extended sample because the number of stages of revision for papers
submitted before 2007 is mechanically high because by sample design we do not capture papers that were accepted
before July 2007.

16

Also, the time series plot in Figure 5 provides evidence that authors responded to the page limit
distribution by shortening papers even in the very rst month or two after the reform.
While we do not have evidence on the order in which authors may have decided to send their
papers to journals29 , we attempt to provide some direct evidence on whether the AER page
limits ultimately led authors to write papers dierently. To do this, we downloaded a subsample
of NBER working papers issued between 2007 and 2012, and examined trends in the relative
fractions of papers of dierent lengths. Since we could not code all the working papers, which are
about 1,000 per year, we coded about 270 per year, quasi-randomly determined in the following
way: we coded articles in 2007 from w13,023 to w13,140 (issued in the Spring of 2007) and then
from w13,400 to w13,550 (issued in the Fall of 2007). For each of the following years, we coded
articles with the corresponding series numbers, but starting with 14,000 (in year 2008), then with
15,000 (in year 2009), and so on until the Spring of 2012.
Figure 10 shows the time series evidence on the page length of these working papers from the
second quarter of 1997 to the second quarter of 2012. The gure shows no evidence that in the
quarters following the page limits the average page length of the working papers got shorter. The
length is constant around 45 pages and, if anything, it gets slightly longer. In a perhaps more
revealing test, there is also no change in the fraction of NBER working papers which are 39-41
pages long, as one may have expected if papers are written to comply with the AER page limits.
While the patterns in the gure are for non-normalized length, the patters using normalized
length are very similar, given that the formatting of the NBER working papers did not change
signicantly over time. While the NBER working papers are not presentative of all working
papers in economics, this evidence does suggest that the AER page limit likely did not change
how papers are written, and rather led to ex-post shortening in the case of AER submissions.

Journal of the European Economic Association

The Journal of the European Economic Association imposed page lengths for a relatively short
3.5 month interval. We compare papers submitted in this period to those submitted before and
after. As shown in Figure 11a, the histograms of page lengths are noisier than the ones for
the AER, reecting the smaller numbers of submissions to JEEA, particularly in the page length
policy period. Still, it appears that the policy change had a dierent impact than at the AER.
Specically, there is less indication of a spike in submissions at or near the page limit.
Figure 12 presents time series evidence on the number of monthly submissions for JEEA,
before, during and after the page length policy was in eect. Several features of this graph are
interesting, and quite dierent from the corresponding graph for the AER. Most importantly,
the drop in submissions of longer papers in the policy period of April-June 2009 is associated
with a corresponding drop in total submissions, but no increase in the fraction of papers close to
the page limit. Taken together, these patterns suggest that JEEA authors responded to the page
limit policy by diverting most of the papers that were above the page limit to other journals.
It is also interesting that after the removal of the page limit policy, submissions appear to have

quickly returned to their pre-page limit rates.
As for the case of the AER, the page length policy coincided with the introduction of new
guidelines for manuscript formatting that may confound changes in the number of shorter and
longer papers. Using the same procedures we developed for the AER, we estimate standardized
page lengths for all submissions to the JEEA. The distributions with and without the page limit
policy are shown in Figure 11b. In contrast to the corresponding gure for the AER (Figure 4b)
there is no rise in the density of papers around the page limit, consistent with the impression
from Figure 12 that many — if not most — longer papers were diverted rather than shortened.
To proceed to a statistical test, we separate papers into shorter papers and longer papers
using a threshold of 30 standardized pages. Figure 13 shows a scatterplot of weekly number of
submissions of short and long papers, using dark squares for the 15 weeks with a page limit policy.
Note that in 13 out of the 15 weeks with a page limit policy the number of longer submissions
was below the predicted line, a pattern that rejects the null hypothesis of equal probability of
occurrence with a p-value of under 1 percent.
Table 5 presents a dierence-in-dierence analysis of the JEEA page length policy. Relative
to the weeks with no page limits, the weeks with page limits are characterized by slightly more
short submissions (2.6 per week versus 2.4) but signicantly fewer longer submissions (3.7 per
week versus 5.7). The dierence-in-dierence estimator implies a loss of 2.15 longer manuscripts
per week, and is statistically dierent from 0.30 This 2.15 paper per week loss represents a 38%
reduction in the inow of longer papers. The specication for the log of the weekly number of
submissions, which omits data for weeks with zero submissions, estimates a somewhat larger loss
of 52.9 percent of the longer submissions, also statistically dierent from zero.
Column 2 of Table 2 presents a series of alternative specications for the dierence in dierences
model that probe the robustness of this estimate. As with the same analysis for the AER, adopting
a quasi-dierencing approach or adding a trend to the model has little impact on the estimated
eect of the policy. Moving the threshold for dening shorter and longer papers from 30 to
35 pages, however, leads to some attenuation of the estimate. Again, however, we prefer the
estimates based on the threshold at 30 pages.
In terms of the common surplus version of our model, the loss of 2.15 longer manuscripts per
week as a result of the page length policy suggests that nearly all submitters of longer manuscripts to the JEEA were unwilling to try to shorten their paper, and preferred instead to submit
elsewhere. Specically, the point estimate of -2.15 longer manuscripts per week implies a loss of
26.7% of all manuscripts. At the 95% level of condence the lower and upper bound losses are
48.9% and 4.6%, respectively. The point estimate of the loss implies an estimate for qW of:
qW = I 31 (1  0=267) = 41 sdjhv
with upper and lower bounds of 35 and 53, respectively.31 The 41-page point estimate suggests
that 100% of longer papers were diverted to other journals when the JEEA had a 40-page limit.
30

The residuals from this weekly regression model are very slightly positively correlated (rst order correlation
= 0.049). Quasi-digerencing the data and re-estimating we obtain a point estimate of -2.16, with an estimated
standard error of 0.94.
31
We can account for sampling error in the distribution function using the lower bound of the 95% condence

Conclusion

How do authors respond to page limits on new submissions? Our analysis shows that the answer
depends on the competitive position of the journal that imposes the limit. Although the pagelimit policies adopted by the Journal of the European Economic Association and the American
Economic Review were identical, authors responded to the JEEA limit by shifting virtually all of
their longer manuscripts to other outlets, whereas authors responded to the AER by reformatting
and shortening their manuscripts. A simple model of author behavior suggests that these very
dierent responses can be explained by dierences in the perceived surplus associated with a
publication at the JEEA versus the AER. The JEEA — a respected but relatively new journal
— faces substantial competitive constraints on its policy choices. In contrast the AER — a top
journal with a reputation built over nearly a century — has monopoly power and can raise the
cost of submission with little or no loss of supply.
We suspect that these ndings also apply to other dimensions of journal policy. Specically,
we conjecture that mid-level journals with multiple competitors face relatively elastic supply, and
can raise or lower submission rates by systematically varying the expected time to rst decision,
or the quality of refereeing. While we have no direct evidence on this response, it is anecdotally
consistent with a substantial increase in submissions to JEEA from 2009 on following a sharp
reduction in the average time-to-rst-decision. In contrast, data presented by Ellison (2002a)
shows a relatively weak relationship between changes in submission rates and trends in time-torst-decision at the top-5 journals over the 1980s and 1990s.
Even at the AER, where the page limit policy had relatively small costs to the journal in terms
of lost submissions, it also appears to have had relatively small benets. In particular, despite the
goal of reducing the length of published papers, the average length of accepted manuscripts was
not signicantly impacted. It is possible that an alternative policy — perhaps linked directly to
the length of nal accepted manuscripts — could have accomplished the same objective at lower
cost, particularly for authors of higher quality, longer papers.

Appendix: Procedures for Measuring Manuscript Length

Instructions for the coding of each AER and JEEA manuscript
•
MC Total Pages (total count of pages).
•
Pages of text and references (include pages of references, but exclude abstract and title
page)
•
Pages of Tables and Figures(if not embedded in text)
•
Pages of Appendix (not including Online Appendix)
•
Pages of Online Appendix/Do Not Publish
•
Cover Page
•
Pages of Abstract/Title/Contents/Blank Pages
•
Page Check
The rst measure is the simple raw count of the number of pages. It is followed by a decomposition into six categories of the number of pages. These categories are exclusive (that is, a page
should be counted into one category or another, not in both) and should sum up to the original
number, which is checked by the column Page Check, which is the sum of the six categories.
The following are notes on how page numbers are counted:
MC Total pages. Notice that, due to the presence of a cover page and often title page,
this number is typically one or two pages longer than the page number on the last page of the
manuscript. You can read the total number of pages o of PDF Acrobat.
Pages of text and references. This is the sum of pages of text and of references, as well as
endnotes (for the papers that have endnotes). This includes adding the references also in the case
in which the references come at the end of the paper, possibly after the Tables and Figures. This
also includes counting pages of text in which Tables and Figures are inserted in the text (see also
below). It does not instead include the abstract and title page.
Pages of Tables and Figures. This counts pages of Tables and Figures coming at the end of
the text (with the exception of Appendix Tables and gures, see below). This is more common in
empirical papers, but it includes theory papers where Figures are presumably plots of models).
If the Tables and Figures are embedded in the text, instead do not count them as separate pages
as per above. Here, be careful because sometimes the Tables and Figures come after pages of
Appendix, you can recognize them though because they will be denoted Figure 1 or Table 1, etc.
Pages of Appendix. This counts the pages of Appendix (typically either mathematical appendix
or Data construction), as well as the case of Appendix Tables and Figures. Appendix Tables
and Figures are labeled Appendix Table 1, Appendix Figure 1, etc., and should be counted as
Appendix instead of as pages of Tables and Figures. (Exception: If it is only one such Appendix
Table or Figure, it is then ok to count it instead as part of Tables and Figures if it speeds things
up) Notice that in some cases the Appendix gures and tables are not labeled Appendix but are
signied with just an “A” — same also for some Appendices themselves; these should be counted
in this category.
Pages of Online Appendix/Do Not Publish. Count separately the pages of Online Appendix
from the pages of Appendix. You will identify the Online Appendix because they typically come
at the end of the paper and (at least in the AER) they are clearly labeled along the lines of
“Online Appendix, not for publication”. Online Appendix Tables and Figures are called Online
Appendix Table 1 and so on; these should be counted as Pages of Online Appendix, not as pages
of Appendix.
Cover Page. The cover page is typically the rst page and the AER and also the rst page in
NBER working papers. It is occasionally missing, or occasionally double, but typically this will
equal 1.
Pages of Abstract/Title/Contents/Blank. Number of pages of abstract, title, and contents,
and blank pages. This is typically 1 or 2, does not include the cover page which is counted in the
category above. Notice: If one page contains abstract and title, and also a few lines of text, do
not count it as text, given that the text is just a small portion, count as Abstract/title. If the
text is more than half page, then count the whole page as text, do not count the title page.
Notice: If there is an extra blank page at the end, do not count it as text, but add it into the
Abstract pages count. Also: If the last page of text is just a few words up to 14 page, do not count
it as text. Count with Abstract pages.
Also notice: How to count half pages: (i) If the remaining half of the page is blank, round
21

up and count as full pages. That is, suppose that a paper has 22 full pages of text and one half
page (that is, the rest of the page is empty), count as 23 pages. (ii) If the page is half text and
half appendix, round and count as part of text. So if there are 22.5 pages of text and 3.5 pages
of appendix, count as 23 pages of text and 3 pages of Appendix.
•
Are Tables/Figures in text
Simply observe quickly going over the text whether the Tables and Figures are at the end in a
separate section, as they usually are (in which case type “no”) or they are embedded in the text
(in which case type “yes”)
Sometimes there are gures or tables both within the text and also at the end. In this case,
mark “yes” for this column. For the Tables/Figures page count include only the number of pages
for the gures and tables at the end of the paper.
•
Font
Record font size as follows: Use Acrobat-Tools bar-“Advanced Editing”-Touchup Text Tool,
then highlight some part of main text, right click and see “Properties”, it’s in the “Text” tab.
Useful shortcut: It may be faster to put the advanced editing bar on the side, click”View”-”Tool
bars”-”Advanced Editing”.
(Method 2: Choose Advanced A Print Production A Output Preview, and select ”Object
Inspector” for the Preview. Click on the text you’re wondering about, and the font that was used
should be displayed in the Output Preview panel.)
Round the font number to the closest integer, that is, if the program returns 11.98, record 12
as font. In cases in which the font is not close to a round number, lets’ say it is 11.31 or 11.69,
round to the closest decimal, that is, 11.3 and 11.7 in these cases. This is relatively uncommon
and this may indicate an unusual font or so, which we should know about.
•
Margins Used: Top, Bottom, Left, Right
First, pick a “normal page” of text. This means not the abstract or a page with title, or one
with footnotes, and not the nal page, as it may be partially empty.
Then record the margins as follows. Use Acrobat-Document bar ”Document”-“Crop Pages”.
This will show the margins. Useful shortcut to do this is to press ”Ctrl+Shift+T”. Then nd the
margin size using the arrows until you nd the correct margins for each dimension (Top, Bottom,
Left, Right). Record margins with one-decimal digit accuracy, that is, 0.8, or 1.1, do not worry
about second digit.
In measuring the margins, use the arrows to go all the way to the text in the page. So for
example for the bottom margin do not stop at the page number, and for the top number do not
stop at the header, if it exists. Do not use the method of checking “remove White Margins” to
obtain the margins. It has proven to be inaccurate, we need to do it with the little arrows by
hand.

Number of characters in a page

Number of characters in a line

Imputed Line Count
Look for a page that has the plainest and most dense text, with no formulas, footnotes, section
headings or Figures. If you nd it, use this page and count by hand the number of lines and record
it in the column “Number of Lines of text in a page”. Leave the column “Imputed Line Count”
empty as this column is relevant only for the next part.
If there is not a full page like that, look for a page that is as dense as possible, this will often
be one of the rst few pages (typically the introduction), which are less likely to contain formulas
and gures. Then count the lines in the page by hand as above, not counting as lines the footnotes
or formulas, and record as “Number of Lines of text in a page”. This for example could be, say,
25 lines. Then, estimate the number of lines of text that would replace the formula, footnotes,
or section headings which you did not count, add it to the count of normal lines, and ll in the
column “Imputed Line Count”. Continuing the example, if you found 3 extra lines that would
t where an equation was, record in the Imputed Line column 28, which is 25+3. Notice that
some authors format large spaces between paragraphs. You do not need to correct for these in the
imputation unless the space is very large, in which case you should count it too in the imputation.
In either case, use the following procedure to obtain the number of characters. To record the
“Number of characters in a page”, copy the full page in Acrobat selecting it with the mouse,
then using the copy function (Ctrl+C), then paste into a blank page in Word (Ctrl+V), and
measure number of characters using Review, Word Count, Characters (with spaces). If there
were equations, delete them rst from the count of the copies page, as the symbols can disrupt
22

the count. Also, do not copy footnotes as the text is much denser and would give a misleading
number. Keep in mind to look over the page of text that you copied into word, as some characters
sometimes copy strangely into Word. It is not uncommon, for example, for the characters “”,
“”, and “” to copy as symbols if the paper was typeset in LaTeX and the fonts were not
uploaded. In this case, do a quick addition to correct the overall number. So for example, if there
were ten such cases, you should add 10 to the total number of characters as in each case that
this occurs two characters (say “”) are replaced with one symbol, which is counted as just one
character.
If you encounter symbols or abnormalities when using the Ctrl+V command, look for the
yellow “paste” icon at the bottom right corner of the pasted text and select the last option,
“Keep Text Only”, as seen in the picture below. Or, choose another page and try again.
For the measure of “Number of characters in a line”, copy from the page above 5 full lines,
that is, not the rst or last one in a paragraph, and then use the count function in Word as above,
and record the average (that is, divide by 5)
•
Date
Record date of completion. We use this to keep track how long it takes to do each entry to
see if we can speed up the procedure.
•
Updated/Reviewed
This is not relevant on rst pass. But if I get back to you and ask you to check an entry, after
you have made the necessary changes (if any), insert a “v” to indicate that the correction has
been made, so I will know that this entry has been checked.
•
Notes
Add here anything unusual (if any) about this paper. For example, if a paper has an unusually
high top Margin, say 2.5 inches, it makes sense to record it here, so I will not think that it’s an
error.
Procedure to normalize page length of published articles for Figure 1
Figure 1 is constructed using the data set of 13,089 papers published in the American Economic
Review, Econometrica, the Journal of Political Economy, the Quarterly Journal of Economics,
and the Review of Economic Studies used in Card and DellaVigna (2013). We measure the page
length of each article using the Econlit information on the nal page and initial page for each
article and taking the dierence (except for 1-page articles which are measure as 1-page long).
However, the dierent journals have very dierent page density, which may also have changed
over time, which makes this measure of page length misleading.
Unlike for our main data set, we cannot do a paper-by-paper normalization using all length
parameters given the very large number of papers. However, to construct a rough normalization
we take advantage of the fact that all papers in a journal are formatted in the same format, so
we do a normalization by computing the typical page density in a given journal, and use that
density to compute a normalization factor which we then apply to the page length of each articles
published in that journal.
To compute the page length of a typical article, we randomly sample from each of the top-5
journals ve articles from each of the following years: 1970, 1975, 1980, 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000,
2005, and 2010. For each of these 5*9 = 45 articles, we measure of the number of characters in a full
page of text following the same procedure detailed above. For all journals except the AER, there
do not appear to be sizeable changes in page density over time, and we therefore take the average
of the measure for the 45 articles sampled from each journal to compute the average page density.
This yields measures of 2,700 characters per page for the Quarterly Journal of Economics, 3,070
characters for the Journal of Political Economy, 3,300 characters for Econometrica, and 4,180
characters for the Review of Economic Studies.
For these journals, we then compute the normalized page length of each article as follows. We
multiply the page length by a conversion factor given by the estimated number of characters per
page divided by 2,550, which is our estimate of the number of characters per page in a 1.5-spaced
page compliant with the AER page limits. So for example, the normalized length of a 10-page
long article in Econometrica is 10*(3300/2550)=12.94 pages long.
For the American Economic Review we produce a time-varying measure of page density both
because of the focus on page limits in this journal and because the AER undertook at least
two signicant changes in page limits, switching to single column format in 2008 and to a lower
density format in 2011. In addition to the measures above, we collect information on the number
of characters per page for 8 manuscripts in each of the following years: 1982,1984, 1986, 1988,
1990, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012.
23

Based on these results and the results for 1970 and 1975, we code the number of characters per
page for the AER as follows: 4210 for 1970-79, 4330 for 1980-89, 4290 for 1990-94, 4440 for 199599, 4570 for 2000-07, 4390 for 2008-10, and 3730 for 2011-12. The biggest change is clearly the
one in 2011 when the AER switched to the same lower page density as used by the AEJ journals.
This change in page density confounds the evaluation of the impact of page limits on the length
of published papers because the conversion factor which we estimate is necessarily approximate
since it does not take into account changes occurring to the Tables and Figures which presumably
were not as aected. As such, the switch in 2011 for the AER should be taken as approximate.
In any case, we then use this number as a factor for normalization in the same way as for the
other journals.

Notes: standard errors in parentheses. Sample includes 52 weeks before page limit policy and 52 weeks after. Papers are assigned to a field based on having at least one JEL code in
the respective field. Not all submissions have JEL codes, and many submissions have 2 or more JEL codes -- thus papers can appear in two or three fields. See text for classification
of fields based on JEL.

Notes: For AER, "No policy" period refers to year before adoption of page length policy,
"Length Policy" refers to year after adoption of page length policy. For JEEA "No Policy"
refers to combined period of 15 months before adoption of policy and 9 months following
abandonment of policy; "Length Policy" refers to 3.5 month period during which page
length policy was in effect.
