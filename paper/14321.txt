Capital Flow Bonanzas: An Encompassing View of the Past and Present

JEL No. F30,F32,F34
ABSTRACT
A considerable literature has examined the causes, consequences, and policy responses to surges in
international capital flows. A related strand of papers has attempted to catalog current account reversals
and capital account "sudden stops." This paper offers an encompassing approach with an algorithm
cataloging capital inflow bonanzas in both advanced and emerging economies during 1980-2007 for
181 countries and 1960-2007 for a subset of 66 economies from all regions. In line with earlier studies,
global factors, such as commodity prices, international interest rates, and growth in the world's largest
economies, have a systematic effect on the global capital flow cycle. Bonanzas are no blessing for
advanced or emerging market economies. In the case of the latter, capital inflow bonanzas are associated
with a higher likelihood of economic crises (debt defaults, banking, inflation and currency crashes).
Bonanzas in developing countries are associated with procyclical fiscal policies and attempts to curb or
avoid an exchange rate appreciation -- very likely contributing to economic vulnerability. For the advanced
economies, the results are not as stark, but bonanzas are associated with more volatile macroeconomic
outcomes for GDP growth, inflation, and the external accounts. Slower economic growth and sustained
declines in equity and housing prices follow at the end of the inflow episode.

1. Introduction
A pattern has often been repeated in the modern era of global finance. Foreign
investors turn with interest toward some developing country. Capital flows in volume
into small and shallow local financial markets. The exchange rate tends to appreciate,
asset prices to rally, and local commodity prices to boom. These favorable asset price
movements improve national fiscal indicators and encourage domestic credit expansion.
These, in turn, exacerbate structural weaknesses in the domestic banking sector even as
those local institutions are courted by global financial institutions seeking entry into a hot
market. At the same time, local authorities resort to large-scale foreign exchange sales of
the local currency to cushion the effects on the exchange rate of the capital inflow
bonanza.
Other policy interventions, such as increases in reserve requirements and
transactions taxes, usually follow to insulate the domestic economy from the
accumulation of reserves. An inherent tension emerges: Local authorities take such
changes as a global vote of approval that might encourage them to delay the difficult task
of structural adjustment.
This pattern is etched sharply in the experience of the ERM, the ERM2, and the
Latin convergence associated with NAFTA and its regional successors. In the run-up to a
more perfect union, potential entrants are increasingly looked upon favorably by global
investors. Those investors appreciate that close integration with a strong anchor country
or group of countries will ultimately discipline policymakers in the periphery, which will
narrow exchange rate fluctuations and country risk spreads and buoy local equity prices.
But these same dynamics also play out in commodity-exporting emerging market

1

economies when the prices of their output surge on world markets or when very low
interest rates and sluggish growth in the advanced countries turn the attention of investors
there outward. Across countries, a different rising tide raises all boats.
But tides also go out when the fancy of global investors shifts and the “new
paradigm” looks shop worn. Flows reverse and asset prices give back their gains, often
forcing a painful adjustment on the economy.
This experience has provided a fertile testing ground for international economists.
A varied flora has blossomed that will be reviewed in Section 2. Given double-entry
bookkeeping and the zero-sum nature of global trade, these issues of global adjustment
have been described in terms of the current or financial accounts and as deterioration in
some countries or improvement in others. Moreover, the time windows have been
chosen to isolate the build-up or run-down of any of these measures.
This paper attempts to be encompassing in its examination of these issues by
simplifying the definition of the key event that is studied and by widening the time
window around that event. We investigate what happens before, during, and after a
capital flow bonanza. That is, we ask how do economies perform in and around periods
when capital inflows are relatively large (or, equivalently, when their financial account
surpluses are relatively large)? Due to data limitations discussed below, we make this
operational by examining episodes of large current account deficits.
We study 181 countries from 1980 to 2007, a subset of 66 countries from 1960 to
2007 for which more detailed information on economic variables is available, and a
smaller group of 18 countries for which house price data are available; the samples
include all regions and income groups. Our primary aim is to quantitatively define and

2

date capital inflow bonanza episodes, so as to study their various aspects. In Section 3,
we document several features of these bonanza periods, including their incidence and
duration. In Section 4, we examine the evidence on potential links between capital flow
bonanzas and debt, currency, inflation, and banking crises. In Section 5, we
systematically illustrate the behavior of a variety of macroeconomic, financial, and policy
indicators on the eve and aftermath of these episodes.
Our main findings can be summarized as follows:
With nearly fifty years of data, it is evident that bonanzas have become more
frequent as restrictions on international capital flows have been relaxed worldwide.
Although the approaches differ, this finding is in line with the evidence presented in
Eichengreen and Adalet (2005).
The heavy inflow episode can persist, often lulling policymakers and investors
into treating the bonanza as a permanent phenomenon rather than a temporary shock.
Episodes end, more often than not, with an abrupt reversal or “sudden stop” à la Calvo
(as in Calvo, 1998). The current account path around bonanzas is distinctly V-shaped,
irrespective of whether the broader, but more recent, sample or the less inclusive, but
longer, sample is the benchmark.
Capital inflow bonanza periods are associated with a higher incidence of banking,
currency, and inflation crises in all but the high income countries (using some of the
crises indicators developed in Kaminsky and Reinhart, 1999, and codified in Reinhart and
Rogoff, 2008a). This result is not the artifact of a few extreme cases; in more than 60
percent of the countries, the probability of a crisis around the dates of a capital flow

3

bonanza is higher than for the entire sample. Capital flow bonanzas systematically
precede sovereign default episodes.
In developing countries (those designated by the World Bank as middle and low
income), the stance of fiscal policy, as measured by the growth in real government
spending, is notoriously procyclical during capital inflow bonanzas. This is consistent
with the earlier observation that temporary “good times” are often treated as permanent.
In effect, our preliminary results also suggest that fiscal policy plays a destabilizing role
around capital flow bonanzas—and possibly more generally.
For the advanced economies, the results are not as stark, as there is no systematic
cross-country evidence over 1960-2007 that the probability of a financial crisis increases
during bouts of heavy capital inflows. The crisis-prone Nordic countries in the early
1990s and the Iceland, U.K., and U.S. crises at present would appear to be important
departures from this general result (as in Reinhart and Rogoff, 2008b). Nonetheless,
capital flow bonanzas are associated with more volatile macroeconomic outcomes for
real GDP growth, inflation, and the external accounts.
Real GDP growth tends to be higher in the run-up to a bonanza and then
systematically lower. The imprint of bonanzas is evident in asset markets. Equity prices
rise when capital flows in and retreat when capital flows out. A similar pattern is evident
in house prices for our small sample. A bonanza is not to be confused with a blessing.
The last section turns to some of the policy implications of our analysis and
discusses possible future research in this area.

2. Concepts and Data Issues
1. Reviewing the existing literature
The existing literature has studied multiple manifestations of international
adjustment in the balance-of-payments data. Double-entry bookkeeping and the global
summing to zero of trade flows produces the four alternative frames of reference laid out
in Table 1. The main issues of adjustment can be described in terms of either an
improvement or deterioration (along the rows of the matrix) in either the current or
capital accounts (along the columns).

There is a rich empirical literature on current account reversals, the upper left cell,
mostly documenting the macroeconomic consequences of a marked improvement in a
sample of many countries. Many features of these studies follow the path laid out in the
pioneering paper by Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti and Assaf Razin (2000). As summarized
in Table 2, they established three criteria to identify a current account reversal that are
now the norm: The change in the balance must be large relative to nominal GDP, large
absolutely in dollar terms, and not the product of a spike in a single year. Focusing on
low- and middle-income countries, they find that the adjustment experience is

5

heterogeneous and depends importantly on whether the currency crashes on the foreign
exchange market.

Their underlying idea is that “large” events provide more information on
determinants of reductions in current-account deficits than short-run
fluctuations. These events have to satisfy three requirements:
1) An average reduction in the current account deficit of at least 3 (or 5)
percentage points of GDP over a period of three years with respect to the three
years before the event;
2) The maximum deficit after the reversal must be no larger than the minimum
deficit in the three years preceding the reversal;
3) The average current account deficit must be reduced by at least one third.
The first and second requirements should ensure that we capture only
reductions of sustained current account deficits, rather than sharp but
temporary reversals. The third requirement is necessary so as to avoid counting
as a reversal a reduction in the current account deficit from, say, 15 to 12
Percent. Events are based on three-year averages.
A Sudden Stop is defined as a phase that meets the following conditions:
1) It contains at least one observation where the year-on-year fall in capital
flows lies at least two standard deviations below its sample mean (this
addresses the“unexpected” requirement of a Sudden Stop).
2) The Sudden Stop phase ends once the annual change in capital flows
exceeds one standard deviation below its sample mean. This will generally
introduce persistence, a common fact of Sudden Stops.
3) Moreover, for the sake of symmetry, the start of a Sudden Stop phase is
determined by the first time the annual change in capital flows falls one
standard deviation below the mean.
1) In addition to the criterion of large capital flow reversals exceeding two
standard deviations from the mean (for their capital flow proxy), CIL require
that
2) these reversals be accompanied by a spike in some external aggregate
measure of the cost of funds in order to capture systemic effects. More
specifically, CIL uses the (log of) J. P. Morgan Emerging Market Bond Index
(EMBI) spread over US Treasury bonds for EMs, the Merrill Lynch Euro-area
Government Index spreads for Euro-area countries (as well as Nordic countries
such as Denmark, Norway, and Sweden), and G7 Government Index spreads
for all remaining developed countries. CIL construct aggregate high-spread
episodes in analogous fashion to the Calvo, Izquierdo and Mejía (2004)
measure of large capital flow reversals (i.e., CIL consider spikes in spreads
exceeding two standard deviations from the mean), and that a Sudden Stop
occurs when the measure of the fall-in-capital-flows phase overlaps (on a
yearly basis) with the aggregate high-spread phase. Episodes that lie within a
six-month interval are considered part of the same Sudden Stop phase.

Barry Eichengreen and Muge Adalet (2005) extended the sample to include the
pre-1970 experience, thereby providing historical context. In particular, large current
6

account reversals appear to be the product of open trade in goods, services, and assets.
Reversals have only been frequent in the two heydays of global capital markets—the
recent period and the 1920s and 1930s. Large adjustments were much rarer under the
pre-World-War I gold standard and during the Bretton Woods years.
An important fuel to the study of current account reversals has been the U.S.
experience of sustained large deficits. The intent is to find rules of thumb that will be
informative about the U.S. experience when the presumed “day of reckoning” comes and
the unsustainable is no longer sustained. The search for such lessons appears in
important papers by Sebastian Edwards (2005 and 2007) and Caroline Freund and Frank
Warnock (2005). They find an important role for the textbook forces thought to rein in a
current account imbalance—a slowing in income growth and a real depreciation of the
currency.
Similar interest in the U.S. experience produced work in the 1980s on why the
current account deteriorated, which is the subject of the lower left cell of Table 1. The
main culprit at that time was identified to be the large budget deficit, which through
national income accounting was mirrored in its twin, the current account.
Contemporaneous discussions of this can be found in Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas
City (1985) and a later review has been provided by Bosworth (1993). This line of
argument petered out in the late 1990s when the U.S. federal budget went into surplus but
the current account remained deeply in red.
Those researchers focusing on the right cells of the contingency table typically
take the perspective of emerging market economies. In particular, they view the portfolio
investment decisions of investors at the center of the global financial system as somewhat

7

fickle. Assets in some emerging markets may be in fashion for a time. Those inflows
tend to appreciate the exchange rate, lead to reserve accumulation as authorities attempt
to offset that force, and push up prices in asset markets. Altogether, this presents a
“capital inflow problem” as described by Guillermo Calvo, Leo Leiderman, and Carmen
Reinhart (1993), an issue also studied by Eduardo Fernandez-Arias and Peter Montiel
(1996).
When capital no longer flows into an emerging market, the nation can no longer
support an excess of spending over income. The result, in the phrase of Guillermo Calvo
and his coauthors, is a “sudden stop,” forcing current account adjustment. The empirical
application of this insight can be found in Calvo, Izquierdo, and Mejia (2004) and Calvo,
Izquierdo, and Loo-Kung (2006), both of which are described in more detail in Table 2.
2. Defining a capital flow bonanza
The decision to adopt a particular algorithm to date and catalog capital inflow
bonanzas naturally involves tradeoffs. An advantage of casting our net wide to all large
capital inflow episodes is that it does not predispose us to episodes that inevitably ended
in a marked reversal. In this sense, there is a lower predisposition to tilt the analysis
toward economic crises. An inflow bonanza can end with a bang or with a whimper. In
this sense, our approach parallels the analysis of Goldfajn and Valdes (1999), who rather
than starting their analysis with currency crises dates, began by documenting episodes of
cumulative real exchange rate appreciations of varying degrees and then sorted out which

8

episodes unwound through an abrupt nominal exchange rate crash and which did so
through reductions in inflation versus their trading partners. 1
We began with the presumption that the best indicator of capital flows would be
reserve accumulation less the current account balance, as it measures the resources
acquired (or dispersed) through issuance (or retirement) of home country liabilities. This
indirect measurement of the change in liabilities seemed more likely to be available for a
longer time span and for more countries than direct information from financial accounts.
In the event, data on reserves tends to be published only on a delayed basis in many
countries. To keep our efforts topical, the current account balance as a percent of GDP is
our benchmark indicator. It is measured more consistently across time and international
boundaries than its capital account and financial account counterpart.2 For the more
recent period, the same filter rules are applied to the other measures as a robustness check
as is reported in an appendix.
We began by applying the three-step approach proposed by Milesi-Ferreti and
Razin to our data set with a suitable revision that does not enforce a current account
reversal. This approach, however, raised some issues about dating the bonanzas of many
well-known episodes. In some countries where the deterioration in the current account
(and hence the rise in capital inflows) was a relatively smooth process over several years,
this algorithm did not flag these episodes as bonanzas even though the current account
deficits were large by historical standards. Heavy inflow cases, such as the United States

1

Gourinchas et. al. (2001) perform a similar exercise to assess which credit booms end in crises and credit
crunches and which do not. Edwards (2004) is particularly careful in trying to consider both abrupt
reversals and more gradual adjustment.
2
We would also like to thank Gian Maria Milesi-Ferreti for pointing out the financial account figures have
to be interpreted with care during years in which there is debt forgiveness, which show up as large debt
repayments (i.e., capital outflows).

9

since 2004 and Australia in several cycles since 1960, were missed altogether. In other
cases, the inflow bonanza persisted after the peak current account deficit had been
reached. For instance, the Thai and Malaysian current account deficits peaked in the
early 1990s; however, while the deficits remained large by historical standards well into
1996, these years are not classified as bonanzas by this algorithm. Many of the important
(but less persistent) surges in capital inflows of the late 1970s and early 1980s also go
undetected.
We ultimately settled on an alternative algorithm that provided uniform treatment
across countries but was flexible enough to allow for significant cross-country variation
in the current account. As in Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999), we select a threshold to
define bonanzas that is common across countries (in this case the 20th percentile).3 This
threshold included most of the better known episodes in the literature but was not so
inclusive as to label a bonanza more “routine” deteriorations in the current account.
Because the underlying frequency distributions vary widely across countries, the
common threshold produces quite disperse country-specific cutoffs. For instance, in the
case of relatively closed India, the cutoff to define a bonanza is a current account
deficit/GDP in excess of 1.8 percent, while for trade-oriented Malaysia the comparable
cutoff is a deficit/GDP ratio of 6.6 percent. 4
Figure 1, which plots the frequency distribution for 181 countries, highlights these
differences both across countries and major income groups. As the figure makes clear,

3

We also impose a non-negativity constraint, so countries that are capital exporters throughout the sample
never record a bonanza.
4
The interested reader is referred to Appendix Figure 2, which provides a comparison among three
definitions of bonanza episodes—using the current account, the financial account, and capital flows.

the range of experience is wide, but large deficits appear more frequently in lowerincome countries.
3. Sample coverage and data
We employ three samples to analyze the capital bonanza phenomenon. The
broadest sample includes the 181 countries covered in the International Monetary Fund’s
World Economic Outlook for 1980 through 2007. Information is available on the current
account, real GDP, inflation, and the real exchange rate. This allows us to examine the
recent country experiences in a truly global setting.
11

We will refer to the second dataset as the “core” sample, which spans 1960
through 2007 and covers 64 countries across all regions. This sample is dominated by
high- and middle-income countries, where data availability poses less of a constraint. It
is for this sample that we are able to examine in greater depth the macroeconomic
features of the bonanzas. Also, for the core countries, we have a sufficiently complete
dating of economic crises (debt, banking, etc.) that allow us to assess whether a capital
inflow bonanza predisposes countries to financial crises.
The third set is a small sample of eighteen industrial countries for which we have
data on house prices from the Bank for International Settlements. Otherwise, the data
coverage for this group is the same as the core group. Appendix Tables 1 and 2 list the
countries (and the income group they belong to) that make up the three samples. 5
All data are annual. In addition to including time series on the current account,
capital and financial accounts, and nominal GDP (all in US dollars), we employ a variety
of macroeconomic times series. These include country-specific variables: international
reserves, nominal and real exchange rates, real GDP, consumer prices, export, imports,
government expenditure, revenue, and deficits, equity, and (in the case of some advanced
economies) real estate prices. In addition, we have dichotomous variables that date
external debt crises, currency crashes, and inflation and banking crises. Global variables,
such as commodity prices, international interest rates, growth in the world’s largest
economies, measures of macroeconomic volatility, and the global incidence of capital
flow bonanzas and various “types” of economic crises, round out the analysis. Appendix
Table 3 provides a full list of the variables as well as their respective sources.

5

The income group classification is that provided by the World Bank.

12

The availability of long time series on various aspects of macroeconomic
performance was important in deciding on the design principle of our key indicator—a
capital flow bonanza. Because we had gathered a sufficiently rich dataset, we could be
somewhat general in defining events, because we will be able to characterize behavior in
a wide window around those events. That is, we can see the run-up and the wind-down
in a manner that encompasses the definitions of earlier work.
3. Capital Flow Bonanzas: Global Cycles and Country Episodes
In what follows, we provide a sketch of country-specific and global capital flow
cycles, including: incidence, by region and income group; duration; and links to global
indicators.
1. The big picture
It is relatively well known that international capital flows have an important
cyclical component.6 The fact that capital (contrary to the predictions of the neoclassical
growth paradigm) does not flow from rich to poor countries has also received
considerable attention. 7 Both of these stylized facts are illustrated in the two panels of
Figure 2, which plot the incidence (i.e. the percent of countries) of capital inflow
bonanzas for the broad sample consisting of 181 countries. The specific dates of the
bonanza episodes on a country-by-country basis are listed in the four-part Appendix
Table 4, for high, middle-high, middle-low, and low income groupings. The third

6

See, for example, Sarno and Taylor (1999), who, using standard time series techniques, decompose the
various components of international capital flows into their permanent and transitory components.
7
Lucas (1990) suggested human capital differentials might account for this “paradox,” while Reinhart and
Rogoff (2004) and Alfaro, et.al. (2008) point to the high incidence of sovereign default and weak
institutions, respectively.

column of this appendix table also provides the dates of sovereign external debt crises
(defaults or restructuring).8 For our core sample of 66 countries, which account for about
90 percent of world GDP, the bonanza dates for 1960 through 2007 are listed in Table 3.
As the top panel of the figure illustrates, the last major “boom in booms” was the
early 1980s. To be more precise, as the core sample reveals for the longer 1960 to 2007
period, the upswing of this cycle was from 1975 to 1982, or just before the onset of the
debt crisis of the 1980s. Prior to 1975, capital flow bonanzas were fewer and further
between, consistent with the historical evidence presented in Eichengreen and Adalet
(2005). Capital flow bonanzas resurfaced in the early 1990s coinciding with a decline in
U.S. interest rates (see Calvo, Leiderman, and Reinhart, 1993 and Chuhan, Claessens and
Mamingi, 1998) and the large-scale Brady plan restructuring of emerging market debt.
This resurgence was modest and occurred in a more selective group of countries—a
feature well documented by the World Bank (1997). With Uruguay in 2002 marking the
last major crisis in emerging markets, bonanzas have re-appeared in force. The regional
breakdown indicates that the recipients in this latest wave include countries in Latin
America, mostly smaller ones benefiting from the commodity-price boom, industrial
countries where real estate prices had been rising rapidly, and the nations of Central and
Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, presumably being rewarded for closer
integration with the European Union.9
Illustrated in the bottom panel of the figure is the well-publicized empirical
regularity that middle- and high-income countries receive the lion’s share of cross-border

The link between capital flow bonanzas and debt crises will be the focus of Section 4.

Discussions of the earlier wave of capital to Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union

capital flows. This is true by a huge margin when flows are measured in U.S. dollar terms
and remains so when we calculate the incidence of bonanzas (which scale current account
deficits by GDP). Despite the fact that low-income countries account for 28 percent (50
countries) of the 181 countries in this sample, less than 18 countries have recorded a
capital bonanza in any given year during the past 30 years or so. The incidence of capital
flow bonanzas is far less cyclical for the low-income group. On the basis of these
observations, we base our more in-depth analysis of capital flow bonanzas and their link
to financial crises in the next two sections on a group of 66 countries, of which 58 are
middle- or high-income.10
The two panels in Figure 3 provide complementary information on the duration of
bonanzas. The upper panel plots the maximum duration of bonanzas (in years) by
countries (rather than episodes). So, for example, six of the 181 countries never
experienced a capital inflow bonanza, as they are net capital exporters; this group
includes Brunei, Luxembourg, Namibia, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United
Arab Emirates. For most countries, bonanzas lasted somewhere between two and four
years, which is perhaps why so many governments (and investors) fall into the all-toocommon trap of treating bonanzas as permanent rather than transitory shocks—an issue
we take up later when examining the typical fiscal response to the abundance of foreign
capital.
Turning now to an analysis of individual episodes, consistent with their cyclical
nature, three-quarters of the episodes identified during 1980 to 2007 last two years or less.
Some caution is in order in that there are a large number of instances in which bonanza

It is important to note that the middle-income group is comprised of middle-low and middle-high income
(the latter constitute the largest single group), so our analysis bears on many developing countries beyond
the largest emerging markets.

longer and adds to the ex-ante confusion as to what is permanent and what is transitory.
The present US bonanza, which began in 2002 and was into its sixth consecutive year by
2007, is by no means common, but neither is it unique. Australia, and the United
Kingdom, among others, experienced similar long-lived bonanzas in the earlier (19601979) period, as Table 3 makes plain.
2. The capital flow cycle and world commodity prices
Capital inflow surges have often been linked to reductions in international
interest rates, economic growth in advanced economies, and global commodity price
booms. 11 In the remainder of this section, we briefly revisit the well-trodden path of the
external roots of capital flow bonanzas. Our primary aim in this paper—beyond
establishing systematically the dates and incidence of capital inflow bonanzas—is to
focus on the macroeconomic consequences or developments surrounding capital flows (a
topic that takes up the next two sections of the paper. As such, we only provide a mere
sketch of the links between the bonanza cycle and selected developments in global
macroeconomic conditions, so as to build on earlier analyses using the most recent data.
To this end, we perform two simple exercises. First, we plot our time series on
the incidence of bonanzas for the 181-country sample over 1980 through 2007 against: (i)
real per-capita GDP growth in the advanced economies, as reported in the IMF’s World
Economic Outlook (upper panel of Figure 4); and (ii) the IMF’s index of real
commodity prices, excluding oil (bottom panel of Figure 4).12 The evidence presented in
top panel of Figure 4 is in line with Calvo, Leiderman, and Reinhart (1993), who posit

See Fernandez-Arias and Montiel (1996) for a survey of a literature that flourished in the early 1990s.
As is conventionally done, the nominal commodity price index is deflated by an index of the price of
manufactures (see, for example Boughton, 1991).

that when growth slows in the advanced economies, global capital searches for higher
yields and profit opportunities abroad in emerging markets—a phenomenon that is well
underway at the current conjuncture, as discussed in Frankel (2007) in the context of the
carry trade and its previous incarnations. The capital flow bonanza-commodity price
boom link has an old history and some classic episodes of well-managed (in terms of the
macroeconomic policy response) and badly-botched varieties make for interesting
reading in Cuddington (1989) and sources cited therein. While the earlier 1980s do not
fit the pattern as neatly, it is important to note that a spectacular boom in commodity
prices prevailed in the late 1970s when the surge in the incidence of bonanzas began in
earnest, as shown in the next section. Beyond the direct positive implications of higher
commodity prices for export revenues for much of the emerging world, as Frankel (2006
and 2008a and 2008b) demonstrates, an underlying impetus to world commodity prices is
low or negative world interest rates, much along the lines of the late 1970s and the last
few years. Hence, the effects of lower international interest rates work not only through
the portfolio channels stressed in Calvo, Leiderman, and Reinhart (1993), but also the
commodity price channel à la Frankel (2006). A third, and important link between world
real interest rates and capital flows to emerging markets comes from the channel stressed
in Dooley and Fernandez-Arias (1996), who emphasize the benign impacts of low real
rates on default probabilities.
Our second empirical exercise is an attempt to explain the share of bonanzas in
terms of the growth of real GDP in the advanced economies, real commodity prices, and
the U.S. real short-term interest rate. We employ the core dataset to capture the
significant swing in real commodity prices as well as the long stretch of negative real

interest rates in the United States in the 1970s. Our dependent variable is contained in a
limited range, from zero to 100 percent as befits a share of a total. Accordingly, we
specify that our independent variables explain the dependent variable by way of a logistic

22

function. That is, the explanatory variables, along with a vector of ones to capture a
constant term, are aligned in the vector xt with corresponding coefficients in the vector β
to obey the functional form, 100·exp(xt β)/[1+exp(xt β)].
The coefficients reported in the first column of Table 4 were estimated with a
maximum likelihood procedure using annual data from 1967 to 2006. As this is a
probability forecasting model, the goodness-of-fit measure we rely on chiefly is the
quadratic probability score (QPS), for the reasons explained in Diebold and Rudebusch
(1989).
As anticipated in the figures, the coefficient on commodity prices is positive and
that on growth is negative; both are statistically significant at the one percent confidence
level. The coefficient on the contemporaneous real interest rate, however, does not match
the intuition provided in Calvo, Leiderman, and Reinhart (1993). Their explanation relies
on the cumulative encouragement to capital flows to the periphery afforded by low
interest rates at the core. To match this, the next six columns of the table report estimates
using successive individual lags of the real rate, from one to six years. In the event, the
size of the negative effect of real rates on the share and the significance of that effect, as
well as the explanatory power of the model, tends to increase as the lag lengthens.

4. Do capital flow bonanzas make countries more crisis prone?
Are capital flow bonanzas a blessing, a curse, or neutral in making financial crises
more likely or more severe? The literature is filled with famous case studies of capital
flow bonanzas that ended in spectacular crises. The papers range from the infamous
episodes in the Southern Cone in the late 1970s-early 1980s (see, for instance, Diaz
Alejandro’s 1985 classic) to Calvo and Talvi (2005), who place great store in the capital
flow sudden stop following the Russian 1998 crisis in explaining Argentina’s subsequent
crash. Rather than focusing on specific episodes that are either as famous or more
obscure, we systematically examine the potential links between the likelihood of a capital
inflow bonanza and financial crises. Our analysis is conducted on a country-by-country
basis as well as at the “global” level consistent with the aim of providing an
encompassing approach. Our comprehensive database on the dates of bonanza and crises
episodes allows us to uncover novel results on the systematic connection between the
incidence of bonanzas and debt, currency, inflation, and banking crises. Hence, our
analysis sheds light on the first part of the question of whether financial crises are more
likely; it remains for future research to investigate issues glimpsed here pertaining to a
possible link between the order of magnitude of the bonanza and the severity of the crises.
The latter part of the section is devoted to more general macroeconomic volatility (as
opposed to crises).
1. Bonanzas and financial crises: preamble and evidence
Section 2 delineated the criteria used to define a capital flow bonanza and
catalogued, country-by-country, all the identified bonanza episodes. To examine the
potential links with financial crises of various stripes, we proceed symmetrically. Our

25

crisis analysis is taken directly from Reinhart and Rogoff (2008). These crises definitions
are reproduced in Table 5, while a full listing of dates for sovereign external defaults (or
restructurings), currency crashes, inflation crises, and banking crises are presented in
Table 6 for 64 of the 66 core countries, for which we have dates on capital flow
Table 5. Defining crises by events: a summary
Type of Crisis

Definition and or Criteria

Comments

Banking crisis

We mark a banking crisis by two types of events:
(1) bank runs that lead to the closure, merging, or
takeover by the public sector of one or more
financial institutions; and (2) if there are no runs,
the closure, merging, takeover, or large-scale
government assistance of an important financial
institution (or group of institutions), that marks the
start of a string of similar outcomes for other
financial institutions.

This approach to dating the
beginning of the banking crises is
not without drawbacks. It could
date the crises too late, because
the financial problems usually
begin well before a bank is finally
closed or merged; it could also
date the crises too early, because
the worst of crisis may come
later. Unlike external debt crisis
(see below), which have welldefined closure dates, it is often
difficult or impossible to
accurately pinpoint the year in
which the crisis ended.

External Debt
crises

A sovereign default is defined as the failure to meet
a principal or interest payment on the due date (or
within the specified grace period). The episodes
also include instances where rescheduled debt is
ultimately extinguished in terms less favorable than
the original obligation.

While the time of default is
accurately classified as a crisis
year there are a large number of
cases where the final resolution
with the creditors (if it ever did
take place) seems interminable.
For this reason we also work with
a crisis dummy that only picks up
the first year.

Inflation crisis

An annual inflation rate 20 percent or higher. We
also examine separately the incidence of more
extreme cases where inflation exceeds 40 percent
per annum.

All consecutive years where the
threshold is met or exceded are
counted as a part of the same
inflation crisis.

An annual depreciation versus the US dollar (or the
relevant anchor currency—historically the UK
pound, the French franc, or the German DM and
presently the euro) of 15 percent or more. This is
similar to the Frankel and Rose (1996) approach to
dating crashes.

Currency
crash

26

In parallel treatment to the
inflation crisis dating, all
consecutive years where the
threshold is met or exceeded are
counted as a part of the same
inflation crisis.

bonanzas.13 In line with our dating of bonanzas, Table 6 provides beginning and ending
dates to define each crisis episode. Hence, an entry of a single year denotes that the crises
only lasted that long.

From the crises dates shown in Table 6 and the bonanza dates listed in Table 3,
we constructed a family of country-specific probabilities. For each of the countries, this
implies four unconditional crisis probabilities, that of: default (or restructuring) on
external sovereign debt, a currency crash, an inflation crisis, and a banking crisis. We
also construct the probability of each type of crisis within a window of three years before

13

The missing two are Japan and the Netherlands, which are creditor countries.

27

and after the bonanza year or years, this we refer to as the conditional probability of a
crisis. If capital flow bonanzas make countries more crises prone, the conditional
probability, P(Crisisi│Bonanza) should be greater than the unconditional probability of a
crisis, P(Crisisi), where the subscript i refers to the ith “type” of crisis (default, currency,
etc.).
Table 7 aggregates these country-specific conditional and unconditional
probabilities by three groups (all countries, high income, and middle and low income).

The main results are summarized as follows. For the full sample, the probability
of any of the four varieties of crises conditional on a capital flow bonanza is significantly

29

higher than the unconditional probability. Put differently, the incidence of a financial
crisis is higher around a capital inflow bonanza. However, separating the high income
countries from the rest qualifies the general result. As for the high income group, there
are no systematic differences between the conditional and unconditional probabilities.
These results are not entirely surprising as the high income countries do not
default on their sovereign debts during the sample in question.14 Given that the threshold
that defines an inflation crisis is 20 percent per annum, it is also hardly a surprise that this
cutoff is seldom surpassed by wealthy countries—whether experiencing a capital flow
bonanza or not. It is less obvious, a priori, that there is no discernable increase in the
likelihood of a banking or currency crisis for the advanced economies. The bottom row
of Table 7 provides the share of countries for which P(Crisisi│Bonanza) ≥ P(Crisisi) as
an additional indication of how commonplace is it across countries to see bonanzas
associated with a more crisis-prone environment. For sovereign defaults, less than half
the countries record an increase in default probabilities around capital flow bonanzas.
(Here, it is important to recall that about one-third of the countries in the core sample are
high income.) For currency, banking, and inflation crises, the majority of countries
register a higher propensity to enter into crisis around bonanza periods.
Beyond the aggregate results presented in Table 7, Figures 5 to 8 for debt,
currency, inflation, and banking crises, respectively, present a comparison of conditional
and unconditional probabilities for individual countries, where the differences in crisis
probabilities were greatest. (Hence, the country list varies across figures). As noted
earlier, no high-income country turns up in Figure 5 on debt crises. The same cannot be

incarnations (see Reinhart and Rogoff, 2008a for a full chronology of these episodes).

said of Figures 6 through 8. While the advanced economies register much lower
(conditional and unconditional) crisis probabilities than their lower income counterparts,
the likelihood of crisis is higher around bonanza episodes in several instances. Notably,
Finland and Norway record a higher probability of a banking crisis during the vicinity of
a capital flow bonanza, while Greece, Italy, and the United Kingdom show a greater
predisposition to an inflation crisis when bonanzas are present.

2. Bonanzas as a predictor of sovereign defaults
Beyond the country-by-country comparisons described in the preceding section,
we wanted to refine further the relationship between bonanzas and sovereign defaults. As
discussed in Reinhart and Rogoff (2008a) in the context of the evidence from 1800 to
2007, there is an intimate connection between the global capital flows (as measured
annually in terms of U.S. dollars) and default (exactly as measured here, by the incidence
of sovereign default). A variant of this relationship is presented in Figure 9, which plots
the annual incidence of capital flow bonanzas during 1960-2007 for the core sample and

the comparable incidence on sovereign default. The overall incidence is higher and more
variable than that shown in Figure 1 for the 181 countries, as the core sample
predominantly represents countries that have access to international capital markets and,
in particular, private flows. A cursory inspection of this figure is suggestive that the
incidence of bonanzas possibly “leads” the incidence of default. This temporal pattern
would seem plausible in light of the fact that capital inflows to developing countries have

35

historically been predominantly debt-creating flows.15 As the bonanza continues,
leverage (usually public and private) increases.16
To investigate this possibility formally, we ran a series of logistic regressions
where the dependent variable is the aggregate or global probability of sovereign default
against the aggregate or global probability of a capital flow bonanza, either
contemporaneous or lagged anywhere between one year and six years. As in the prior
section, this functional form respects the limited range of the dependent variable. These
results are summarized in Table 8 along the column headings for lags up to six years. As
the results indicate, the fit of regression improves steadily as the lag length is extended up
to six years. The single bonanza regressor is statistically significant at the one percent
level for the regressions where the t-statistics appear in italics. The preferred
specification (six lags) yields an R2 of about 0.50. Similarly, the QPS statistic falls. As
in the previous discussion on determinants, the global factors behind bonanzas, this
exercise is meant to be illustrative rather than a self-contained model of sovereign default.
It is worth mentioning that this external default time series registers a contemporaneous
correlation with world real interest rates of 0.59, underscoring that there are multiple
factors beyond bonanzas that determine the likelihood of a sovereign debt crises. These
results would not be unfamiliar to the reader on Mendoza and Terrones (2008), who
conclude that not all credit booms end in financial crises, but most emerging markets
crises were associated with credit booms.

15

It is important to reiterate that the incidence of sovereign default during the period in question owes to
emerging markets.
16
On the basis of the historical track record, it is plausible to expect a higher chance of a sovereign default
after a bonanza even in cases where government debt is not increasing. This is because the government
sooner or later has usually ended up guaranteeing private sector debts.

3. Bonanzas and macroeconomic volatility
Crises, like bonanzas, are discrete, traumatic, and (in the more stable countries)
relatively rare. Yet another possibility where capital flow bonanzas would be less than a

37

blessing might be if these bouts of capital inflows lead to an overall increase in
macroeconomic volatility, even if it did not increase the odds of a financial crisis outright.
To shed some light on this issue, we performed some simple exercises involving the
volatilities of real GDP growth, consumer price inflation, and the current account-GDP
ratio. Needless to say, this only skims the surface of the potential links between
bonanzas and macroeconomic volatility.
We measure volatility as the 66th percentile of the absolute annual change in each
macroeconomic variable. Table 9 reports for the full sample the simple pairwise
correlations between the incidence of capital inflow bonanzas from 1981 to 2007 and the
volatility (as described above) of real GDP growth, inflation, and the current account to
GDP. For all three variables the correlation is positive (ranging from a low of 0.25 fo
inflation to a high of 0.43 for real GDP growth) and statistically significant. Of course,
this exercise does not speak of causality or how representative this “global” bonanzavolatility link plays out for individual countries.

5. Anatomy of Bonanza Episodes
The macroeconomic developments associated with surges in capital inflows are a
mixture of anecdotal evidence from case studies and more systematic analyses which (to
our knowledge) have no standardized definition of “a capital inflow episode” or
bonanza.17 The collective evidence from this literature suggests that capital inflows are
most often associated with both a deterioration in the current account and an
accumulation in international reserves, ostensibly from the central bank’s persistent
efforts to avoid or mitigate the tendency towards a nominal and real exchange rate
appreciation that usually goes hand-in-hand with the capital inflow.18 As Calvo,
Leiderman,and Reinhart (1993) document in several papers, the pressures for the
exchange rate to appreciate stem both from an increased demand for the local assets
(which may or may not lead to an asset price boom or bubble) as well as from an increase
in aggregate demand for both traded and nontraded goods. As long as the supply of the
nontraded good is not perfectly elastic, the relative price of nontradeables increase (i.e., a
real exchange rate appreciation).
In an attempt to analyze the cyclical behavior of fiscal policy in advanced and
emerging market economies, Kaminsky, Reinhart, and Vegh (2004) present evidence for
emerging markets of the “when it rains, it pours” phenomenon; that is to say that the
cyclical components of GDP, net capital flows and real fiscal spending all reinforce each
other. Periods of cyclically high capital inflows are associated with an expansion in real
government spending—fiscal policy is procyclical both in relation to output and capital
inflows.
17

See Reinhart and Reinhart (1998) for a discussion of the stylized facts and the references cited therein.
See Reinhart and Reinhart (2008) for evidence of fear of floating or, in the recent context, fear of an
appreciation.

18

39

Some of these macroeconomic trends, notably the worsening current account,
appreciating real exchange rates, and rising asset prices, regularly present themselves on
the eve of currency and banking crises (Kaminsky and Reinhart, 1999) and sudden stops
(Edwards, 2004 and 2007). In the remainder of this section, we extend such comparisons.
1. Growth, inflation, and the current account
Capital flow bonanzas—as with sudden stops, current account reversals, and
financial crises—each have their own idiosyncrasies. However, these episodes also tend
to share common threads that cut across time and national boundaries, which we exploit
by opening a wide window of comparison.
Our strategy is to examine the behavior of key macroeconomic and financial
indicators in the run-up and aftermath of the identified bonanza episodes, starting with
the “big picture.” Figure 10 presents four panels showing medians across episodes
during 1980 to 2007 for key macroeconomic indicators: real GDP growth, inflation, the
current account balance-to-GDP, and the real exchange rate. We plot each series from
four years (-4) before the bonanza (year 0) to four years (4) after. Because of the
enormous diversity in our 181-country sample, the medians are plotted separately for
high-, middle-, and low-income countries (denoted by a solid, dashed, and dotted lines,
respectively). In line with the findings of several papers on capital account reversals and
sudden stops, the average path of the current account balance to GDP (top right panel) is
distinctly V-shaped, with the current account deteriorating into the bonanza year and

40

Figure 10. Growth, inflation, the current account, real exchange rate around
bonanzas: 181 countries, 1980‐2007

improving steadily thereafter. Note that this is not an artifact of our selection criteria.
We do not select for big changes, only big levels. Current account deficits are, on
average, largest for the low-income countries and smallest for the advanced economies,
consistent with the evidence reported earlier on cut-off values. The path of the real

41

exchange rate (bottom left panel) shows that there is a cumulative appreciation (a decline
denotes an appreciation) up to the bonanza year and a sharp depreciation afterwards. The
analysis of Goldfajn and Valdes (1999) presents compelling evidence that in the
overwhelming majority of cases, the cumulative real appreciation unwinds through a
swift nominal depreciation (perhaps through a full-fledged currency crisis) rather than
through a downward adjustment in prices.
GDP growth rises into the bonanza but then slows, settling back to a roughly prebonanza growth rate for middle- and low-income countries and a markedly lower growth
rate for high-income economies. As to inflation, the trajectory is so diverse across the
three income groups that it is impossible to draw any conclusion as to a fixed behavioral
pattern. This suggests that the efforts of central banks in anchoring expectations are more
important than the stage of the capital-flow cycle.
This association holds across individual countries as well. Figure 11 provides
reinforcing cross-episode evidence via scatter plots that compare the real GDP growth
and inflation performance for the year before and after the bonanza. Observations above
the 45 degree ray indicate that growth (inflation) is higher one year after the bonanza than
the year before the bonanza episode; the converse is true for observations below the
diagonal. Taken together these scatter plots confirm that for the most part (63 percent of
the episodes) growth is lower after the capital inflow boom, while no clear pattern
emerges for inflation.

181 countries, 1980‐2007

43

The narrative illustrated in Figure 12 for the core 66 countries for the longer
sample spanning 1960 through 2007 intimately mirrors the broader post-1980 experience;
the current account registers a V-shaped pattern, inflation is markedly different for the
wealthy and not-so-wealthy countries, and real growth picks up in the run-up to the
Figure 12. Growth, inflation and the current account around bonanzas:
66 countries, 1960‐2007

bonanza but does worse in the aftermath—particularly for high-income countries.
Whatever growth benefits accrue during the bonanza phase are but short-lived.

44

2. External sector: Reserves, exchange rates, and trade
There is a blossoming recent literature trying to explain why many emerging
market countries have been amassing international reserves at an unprecedented clip.
Some studies have stressed a “precautionary” motive in which countries build their war
chests in good times to provide liquidity if need be in bad times.19 What the upper panel
of Figure 13 makes plain is that the practice of accumulating reserves, especially in
developing countries during capital inflow years (which characterizes the current juncture
for many emerging markets) is far from new, as the episodes depicted in this figure span
1960 to the present. Reluctance to allow for a sustained nominal or real exchange rate
appreciation is a constant that has withstood the test of time in emerging markets.
Tendencies to lean against the wind are seldom more pronounced than when there is a
capital inflow bonanza underway. The forty-percent-plus increase in reserves in the runup to the bonanza is no trivial change for the middle and low income countries, who as of
2007 held about twice as much in reserves as their high-income counterparts (bottom
panel).

19

See for instance, Bastourre, Carrera, Ibarlucia (2008), and Carrol and Jeanne (2008).

45

46

There is little surprising in Figure 14, which displays the same graphs for the
external indicators (trade balance, exports, imports, and real exchange rate) for the 66country sample. The trade balance follows the same path of the current account, as
imports expand more rapidly than exports at the outset of the bonanza. The real
exchange rate initially appreciates and subsequently depreciates in the years immediately
following the capital flow bonanza. The only incremental evidence revealed by
Figure 14 is that the real depreciation shown in the bottom right panel is noticeably
smoother than that shown in Figure 9 for the 181 country average post-1980; possibly,
this difference may reflect that crises are more severe (Kaminsky and Reinhart, 1999) and
reversals more acute (Eichengreen and Adalet, 2005) in the more recent period or that the
addition of lower-income countries in the larger sample adds to volatility.
3. Fiscal policy: amplifier or stabilizer
Managing surges in capital inflows poses nontrivial policy challenges, particularly
if the inflows are persistent and/or if the orders of magnitude are staggering; these policy
challenges are discussed in detail and examples provided in Reinhart and Reinhart (1998).
Policy responses can mitigate the down-side of capital flow bonanzas (recall the main
conclusion from the preceding section is that bonanzas are historically associated with
higher odds of a financial crises) or amplify their more worrisome tendencies. The
mismanagement of capital flow bonanza-commodity price boom episodes (see
Cuddington, 1989) more often than not has its roots in the authorities’ premise that the
“good times” are permanent and, as such, can fully support a full-fledged expansion in
real fiscal spending. This is the essence of fiscal procyclicality as documented by Gavin
and Perotti (1997) and Kaminsky, Reinhart, and Vegh (2004) (or KRV henceforth).

47

Figure 14. External indicators and bonanzas: 66 countries, 1960‐2007

Figure 15 presents, in a comparable format, the evolution of real government
spending and revenues and the fiscal balance (all indexed to the level four years prior to
the bonanza). The deeply entrenched pattern of procyclical fiscal behavior by middle and
low income countries emerges unambiguously from the three panels that make up the
figure. Government spending from two years prior to the year of the bonanza rises by
about 20 percent in real terms at a time during which growth is accelerating, as discussed.
Despite even faster growth in government revenues (than in expenditures), the fiscal
balance deteriorates markedly into the bonanza year. (This deterioration materializes

48

Figure 15. Fiscal Indicators and Bonanzas: 66 Countries, 1960‐2007

because, while revenues are growing more rapidly, they are doing so from a lower base
than expenditures four years prior to the bonanza.) The lax expenditure during the boom
phase (and the associated deterioration in the fiscal balance) sets the stage for a “nonvoluntary” fiscal tightening when the economic downturn sets in. Hence, as KRV (2004)
illustrate, the magnitude of the swing in real fiscal spending during the cycle from boom
to bust can be as large as 25 to 35 percentage points (as in the case of Uganda and Liberia,
respectively.)20

20

To be clear, the amplitude of the swing is calculated as the percent growth in real government spending
during an expansion minus the growth in government spending in downturns. In the case of an extremely
procyclical government, real spending would grow during good times (as shown in Figure 15), perhaps by

49

KRV rank the government’s procyclicality propensity by two measures: the
correlation between the cyclical component of real GDP and real fiscal spending (if
positive, it implies procyclicality) and the amplitude of the swing in real spending (as
described). Using these two indicators, we conducted a simple exercise to shed light on
the plausible conjecture that the procyclical nature of government spending may help
explain why the odds of a financial crisis increase around capital flow bonanzas, as
illustrated in the preceding section. On a cross-country basis, we correlated the
difference between the conditional, P(Crisisi│Bonanza), and unconditional probability,
P(Crisisi) for each of the four types of crises (as shown for selected countries in Figures
4-8) and the two KRV measures of fiscal procyclicality (one at a time). The eight
correlations were positive ranging from 0.25 to 0.46; six of the correlations were
statistically significant. The results of these preliminary exercises are, thus, consistent
with our conjecture about the destabilizing role of fiscal policy around capital flow
bonanzas—and possibly more generally.
4. Asset markets
The last indicators we examine around bonanza periods are asset prices,
specifically, real equity prices for the 66-country sample and real house prices for a
subset of 18 high income countries for the period from 1970 through 2007. There has
been discussion and some anecdotal evidence to suggest that asset prices boom during
some famous capital inflow bonanzas (as in Calvo, Izquierdo and Talvi, 2003). Such a
phenomenon appears reasonable, as a capital inflow represents an increased demand (by
the rest of the world) for a particular country’s assets, which would include equity and

15 percent; and in downturns it would contract by about 10 percent. Thus the amplitude of the swing
during the business cycle would be 25 percent.

50

real estate. As to asset prices and crises, one cannot read Kindelberger (1989) without
drawing a tight link between the two.
Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999) present evidence to suggest that equity price
bubbles are systematically present in the eve of banking crises—indeed, they are a good
leading indicator of these. Reinhart and Rogoff (2008b) present evidence that real house
prices boomed on the eve of the worst post-World War II banking crises in emerging
market economies.
Figures 16 and 17 suggest a three-way link between capital inflow bonanzas, asset
price booms, and financial crises. For both asset markets (for equities in Figure 16 and
houses in Figure 17), there is a marked rise in inflation-adjusted prices that peaks at the
time of the bonanza and is followed by a sustained decline during the four years
following the bonanza. Taking together the evidence on the higher likelihood of a
sovereign default in particular (and other types of financial crises in general), the
slowdown in real GDP growth, and the protracted decline in asset values following the
capital bonanza, the swift corrections in the twin deficits (current account and fiscal)
observed after the bonanza may likely be a matter of necessity rather than choice.

6. Conclusion
Conversations revolving around international financial adjustment sometimes
have an aspect similar to the climactic scene in a few Hollywood crime movies in which
the villain lures the hero in a hall of mirrors. It is not clear which is the originating action
and which is the reflection, so that left can be right, or right left. Invariably, the initial
target turns out to be glass. In international finance, one country’s current account
surplus can correspond to many countries’ deficits, and a surplus is mirrored in a deficit
in the capital account. As a consequence, the considerable literature on international
adjustment overlaps to a significant degree, even though the studies adopt different
selection criteria for what constitutes an event.
We have adopted a back-to-basics approach toward understanding some of the
features of episodes of heavy capital inflows which, given double-entry bookkeeping, has
usually meant periods of large current account deficits by historical standards. By
focusing squarely on the perspective of the recipient of capital inflows (wherever or
however poor or wealthy that country may be), our analysis does not extend to issues
pertaining to lending countries or the broader and currently popular discussion of global
imbalances. Nearly all the areas we have touched upon, both as to the causes and
consequences of the bonanzas, merit further scrutiny, particularly as relates to the links
between asset prices, bubbles, crises, and capital flows.
As to the policy responses to capital inflow bonanzas, our analysis has been silent
in all dimensions but one. Namely, we present evidence on the infamously procyclical
and destabilizing reaction of fiscal policy (specifically government spending) to the

54

capital flow bonanza in nearly all but the high income countries.21 The expansionary
fiscal policy unfolds against a backdrop of higher growth in output and government
revenues associated with the bonanza. It is not unreasonable to conjecture that these
government spending practices in “good times” set the stage for a multi-decade pattern of
serial default.
During the past few years, international interest rates have remained low (by
historical standards), and real interest rates have turned negative on a sustained basis for
the first time since the late 1970s. Commodity prices have surged. Once again,
investors in the financial centers of the world and elsewhere are tripping over themselves
in the eternal quest for higher yields in emerging markets and other higher-risk
investments. From an emerging market perspective, the external scenario of the past few
years can be best characterized as “benign.” Yet, as of 2007, 85 percent of countries in
our core sample have recorded increases in real government expenditures. Perhaps once
again, authorities view the favorable global environment as permanent). Fully two-thirds
of the 181 countries covered in the IMF’s latest World Economic Outlook recorded
higher inflation in 2007 than in 2006, and an equal share recorded even higher inflation
on a year-end basis in 2007 than on a year-average basis—pointing to even higher
readings for 2008. If this is what is to be expected in good times, where capital bonanzas
are plentiful, it is perhaps time to start re-reading Kindleberger.

21

It is important to recall that there is a positive association between the degree of fiscal procyclicality and
the incremental odds of a financial crisis around capital flow bonanzas.
