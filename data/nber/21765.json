    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper examines to what extent agency rulemaking is democratic. It reviews theories of administrative rulemaking in light of two normative benchmarks: a \u201cdemocratic\u201d benchmark based on voter preferences, and a \u201crepublican\u201d benchmark based on the preferences of elected representatives. It then evaluates how the empirical evidence lines up in light of these two approaches. The paper concludes with a discussion of avenues for future research.\n\n",
