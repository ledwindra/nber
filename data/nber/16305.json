    "abstract": "\n\nAlthough international programs for carbon offsets play an important role in current and prospective climate-change policy, they continue to be very controversial.  Asymmetric information creates several incentive problems, include adverse selection and moral hazard, in offset markets.   The current regulatory focus on additionality tends to paint all these problems with a broad brush without proper consideration of the context or their implications.\n\n",
