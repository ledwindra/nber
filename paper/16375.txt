The World Distribution of Productivity: Country TFP Choice in a Nelson-Phelps Economy
Erika Färnstrand Damsgaard and Per Krusell
NBER Working Paper No. 16375
September 2010
JEL No. F43,O1,O33,O4
ABSTRACT
This paper builds a theory of the distribution of TFP across countries. The theory is based on the hypothesis
that TFP improvements in a given country follow a Nelson-Phelps specification: they derive from
past investments in the country itself and, through a spillover term, from past investments in other
countries. Within a stochastic dynamic general equilibrium model of the world, each country invests
in TFP and internalizes the dynamic effects of its investments, while ignoring any effects on others.
Small symmetric idiosyncratic shocks can lead to large long-run differences in TFP levels and the
world TFP distribution may become twin-peaked.

Introduction

What explains the relative levels of riches across countries? Building on the approach used
in Klenow and Rodrı́guez-Clare (1997) and Hall and Jones (1999), Jones (2008) offers a recent account attributing the bulk of observed income-per-capita differences among countries
to “TFP”, or Total-Factor-Productivity, i.e., essentially to residually measured productivity
differences. TFP differences are residual in that they capture the productivity differences
that remain after differences in physical and human capital (per capita, or per worker) have
been measured and taken into account, using the assumption of an aggregate Cobb-Douglas
production function. Thus, under the assumptions maintained in these accounting analyses,
to understand differences in income across countries it is not sufficient to understand differences in rates of accumulation of physical or human capital, at least if the available measures
of physical and human capital are accurate. Therefore, much of the growth theory that analyzes such accumulation may “miss the point”, if the purpose is to explain relative income
differences across countries quantitatively. In conclusion, it seems reasonable to concur with
the way Prescott (1998) puts it: “Needed: A Theory of Total Factor Productivity”. The
present paper proposes one direction in which theories with this aim might be built.
We also take the point of view that a theory of the world distribution of TFP should,
ideally, display two features. One is that long-run world TFP growth is endogenous, i.e.,
“nontrivially” determined within the model. Thus, in this sense we very much take the
view of the endogenous growth literature (Romer (1986), Lucas (1988), Rebelo, (1991), and
others). Whether the long-run world growth rate (or perhaps just the level increments) is
endogenous is perhaps not central; for simplicity here though, we assume that it is. The
second feature that we view as essential is that whereas each given country can influence its
relative TFP level, it can do little to influence its own long-run rate of TFP growth. More
precisely, we view countries as small and their long-run growth rates as determined by the
rate at which “world TFP” (i.e., some average, or perhaps the frontier) grows. This view
is partly based on there only having been rather minor increases in the dispersion among
countries during the period over which there is reliable country income data (essentially,
Heston, Summers and Aten (2006)). In addition, modern economies are arguably (i) highly
dependent on world technological developments, as evidenced by, among others, Benhabib
and Spiegel (1994), who find productivity catch-up to be statistically significant for growth of
TFP; and (ii) open in the sense that even if conventional trade is not entirely free, technology
spillovers flow rather freely across countries in the world. In sum, we view the world average
growth rate as endogenous but, conditional on this rate, any individual country’s growth
rate as exogenous.
Given this perspective, we construct a theory of the world TFP distribution that has at
its core the specification of technology advancement proposed in Nelson and Phelps (1966).
They hypothesized a form of technology, or human-capital, catch-up: in a country context,
the growth rate of technology, or human capital, in a given country can be increased if
this country invests, and the further is the distance from the technology frontier, the more
2

productive is such an investment. That is, if a country is further behind, the potential
for rapid growth is higher, since the country can “free-ride” on technologies/human capital
accumulated elsewhere. A Nelson-Phelps view of development is indeed taken explicitly in
Jones’s (1998) textbook on economic growth: he embeds the Nelson-Phelps formulation into
a developing-country growth model, and uses it as a framework for productivity accounting
and growth dynamics. In this paper we thus take the Nelson-Phelps-Jones perspective on
development but then go on to ask a further question: if countries are subject to this “technology for productivity growth”, and each country operates the technology optimally from
the viewpoint of maximizing the utility of its citizens, what is the implied equilibrium world
distribution of country TFP ? Since the catch-up term by definition means that countries
benefit from spillovers, there is an obvious force for convergence, but how does this force
play out in equilibrium?
Our main findings can be described as follows. Although convergence forces are always
present in the model, if the catch-up term is weak enough, the stable long-run world distribution of TFP is not single-peaked but bimodal. There is one group of countries with high
TFP in relative terms, with the remainder of the countries operating at a much lower TFP
level. All countries grow at the same rate, but the high-TFP countries invest more in technology than do low-TFP countries. The catch-up term thus allows the low-TFP countries to
grow at the same rate and not fall further behind in relative terms. The bimodality is first
derived using a model without idiosyncratic (country-specific) TFP shocks, and with this
setting bimodality means that the long-run TFP distributions have two (and exactly two)
groups of countries, within each of which all countries have the same TFP level. In the model
with shocks, in contrast, there is a “smooth” long-run distribution, and this distribution can
have two visible peaks or just one. However, even when there is a single peak in the TFP
distribution, and where the corresponding long-run, no-shocks outcome has a single group
of countries with identical TFP, the distribution can have significant dispersion around the
mode. Thus, the theory embodies strong forces pulling countries apart.
Formally, in our model, individual countries can invest in a technology-enhancing input,
e, in order to increase their TFP, T . We think of this investment input as a traded one
(such as educated workers), which can thus be allocated across countries, and there will
be an equilibrium world price for this input. The accumulation of TFP, as mentioned, is
of the Nelson-Phelps (1966) form: TFP growth in a given country depends positively on
investment in TFP and, in addition, on the country’s distance to the world technology
T
= ( TT̄i,tt )γ H(ei,t ),
frontier, which generates catch-up. The formal specification is that Ti,t+1
i,t
where i is a country index and t stands for time; T̄ is world average (or frontier) TFP, and the
function H, which is increasing, describes how e units translate into TFP growth units. In
the model, all countries are symmetric; they have identical technologies and only potentially
differ by their initial conditions. The distribution of countries over TFP levels is determined
by two counteracting forces. First, the technological catch-up of less developed countries
generates convergence. Second, the internalization of country-specific dynamic gains from
TFP investment generates divergence. Thus, in terms of this specification, we find that the
3

distribution of TFP can be bimodal, provided that the weight on the catch-up factor in the
Nelson-Phelps equation, γ, is sufficiently close to zero.
The intuition why catch-up is a force for convergence is straightforward. Why, though,
is there a force for divergence if γ is small? Consider the extreme case, i.e., γ = 0. Here,
we can write the TFP technology as Ti,t+1 = Ti,t H(ei,t ), and it is clear that, as a dynamic
technology for accumulation, the system has increasing returns to scale, as long as H is
increasing: if Ti,t and ei,t both double, Ti,t+1 more than doubles, or doubles exactly if H
is flat. Thus, when individual country planners operate technologies of this sort, there are
dynamic increasing returns to scale, and thus internalizing these gains is important and
leads to a force for divergence: those countries with initially (or, by idiosyncratic stochastic
events) high Ti levels have an advantage in further growth.
How can our findings be used to interpret the available country data? Aside from providing a theory of relative TFPs in the world (and a potential for bimodality), we use the
theory to speculate on the findings in Acemoglu (2009). He plots a sequence of distributions
of countries according to GDP per worker, for 1960, 1980, and 2000, and it reveals some visible changes in the shape of the distribution and, in particular, in the “degree of bimodality”.
Thus, the 1980 and 2000 distributions are “more bimodal” than is the 1960 distribution. In
terms of the model, a move toward bimodality can for example be due to (i) a decrease in
effective spillovers (a lower γ); (ii) a decrease in the cost of trading e; (iii) increases in the
extent to which e affects TFP (a change in the shape of H); or (iv) transitional dynamics.
We interpret and compare these channels in Section 8 of the paper.
Our present setting is not designed as a full-fledged quantitative assessment of the kind of
theory we propose; among other things, we abstract from capital accumulation (thus, TFP
and labor productivity are synonymous). Perhaps more importantly, a serious quantitative
model of world TFP would require more geographic detail than our setting with (ex-ante)
identical countries, since we envisage the critical distinction here—between which TFP investments are internalized and which are not—to coincide with country borders. Thus, for
example, γ should in principle be determined based on how large countries are, and it would
arguably also be more appropriate with a model which has heterogeneity in γ across countries. Such an extension, and a full quantitative investigation, would be an interesting one to
pursue. Thus, our present analysis is to be interpreted as a first pass at how “rational TFP
accumulation decisions on the country level”, in combination with technology spillovers as
proposed by Nelson-Phelps, deliver a model of relative riches in the world.
The paper is organized as follows. The related literature is presented in Section 2. Section
3 describes the model. The balanced growth equilibrium of the model is defined in Section
4. Section 5 describes the symmetric balanced growth equilibrium, and analyses its stability.
Asymmetric balanced growth equilibria and their stability properties are characterized in
Section 6. In Section 7, the model is extended to allow for country-specific shocks to TFP.
Section 8 entails an analysis of what model parameters might change the distribution of
relative TFPs over time, and Section 9 concludes.

Related literature

In an influential article, Nelson and Phelps (1966) argued that in an economy with technological change, the more educated the workforce is, the faster new technologies of production will
be introduced. The argument was formalized in a model where advancement of technology
depends positively upon investment in education and upon the gap between the best-practice,
or frontier, technology and the technology currently used. Parente and Prescott (1994) incorporate a similar mechanism into a model of an economy featuring firms, households, and
a government. They propose that differences in barriers to technology adoption can account
for the observed income disparities across countries. In the model, a firm can invest in
adoption of more productive technologies, and the amount of investment needed depends on
the barriers to technology adoption in the country where it operates. Parente and Prescott
calibrate the model and argue that the differences in barriers required to account for the
observed cross-country income differences are not implausibly large. Similarly, Jones (1998)
endogenizes technology diffusion in the Romer model, by introducing the model proposed by
Nelson and Phelps. He assumes that a country’s human capital or skill accumulation depends
on investment in education as well as technological spillover from the technology frontier.
While Parente and Prescott (1994) and Jones (1998) introduce the Nelson-Phelps framework
into growth models, both explore the implications for income levels and growth rates in a
partial equilibrium setting. In this paper, we extend the analysis to general equilibrium.
Large differences in per capita income across countries as well as a “twin-peaked ”distribution of world income has been documented by for example Quah (1993), Quah (1997),
and Kremer, Onatski, and Stock (2001). Several economists have constructed models aimed
at explaining these empirical findings. An example is Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan (1997)
which uses a neoclassical growth model to determine how much of the variation in incomes
across countries that can be explained by distortions to capital accumulation. The distortions
are modeled as a stochastic process for the price of investment relative to consumption. Similarly, Acemoglu and Ventura (2002) explain the world income distribution by accumulation
of capital in combination with international trade and specialization. However, technology,
rather than physical or human capital, appears to be the main determinant of the differences
in incomes. For example, Klenow and Rodrı́guez-Clare (1997) find that about 50 percent
of cross-country variation in GDP per worker is explained by differences in productivity.
Similarly, Jones (2008) finds that approximately one-third of differences in income across
countries can be explained by differences in capital per person, while differences in TFP
explain the remaining two-thirds. Therefore, along with Parente and Prescott (1994), a
number of models have been developed to explain income differences by modeling differences
in productivity rather than in accumulation of capital.
Several models constructed to explain the differences in income across countries have
used the Schumpeterian growth model as a point of departure. For example, Howitt (2000)
analyzes a multi-country version of the Aghion-Howitt endogenous growth model with technology transfer across countries. Under the assumption that the countries differ in their R&D
5

productivities, R&D subsidy rates, or investment rates, the model can generate “club convergence”, whereby countries which invest in R&D will converge to parallel growth paths, and
countries which do not will stagnate. Howitt and Mayer-Foulkes (2005) use a similar model
with technology transfer across countries. However, the extent to which a country benefits
from technology transfer depends on its “absorptive capacity”. In that model, countries sort
into three convergence groups characterized by R&D, implementation and stagnation, respectively. Aghion, Howitt and Mayer-Foulkes (2005) introduce credit market imperfections
in the multi-country Schumpeterian model. The model exhibits technology transfer, where
an investment in R&D is a prerequisite for the receiving country to benefit from the transfer.
It is assumed that R&D requires access to external finance, at a cost which depends on the
level of financial development. The model predicts that countries above a certain threshold of
financial development will converge to a high growth rate, whereas other countries converge
to strictly lower growth rates. Lucas (2000), finally, also analyzes a model of world income
based on technology diffusion. He calibrates the model and finds that the predictions are
consistent with “club convergence” over the postwar period.
The present paper also models investments in productivity, but aside from taking an
explicit Nelson-Phelps view on technology diffusion, it differs from the models described
above in two additional ways. First, rather than assuming that countries have different
characteristics, it treats all countries symmetrically. In addition, it models internalization of
the dynamic gains from productivity investments at a country level.

Model

The world consists of a continuum of countries indexed i. Each country produces output,
and invests in TFP accumulation in order to increase future output. The investment in TFP
can be R&D, technology adoption, improving institutions etc. Each country is endowed
with both low-skilled and high-skilled labor, where low-skilled labor is used in production
of output and high-skilled labor in the accumulation of TFP. The number of high-skilled
workers employed in country i at time t is denoted ei,t . It is assumed that low-skilled labor
is immobile while high-skilled labor flows freely across countries. The total amount of highskilled labor in the world is fixed, and it is equal to eW . All countries are of the same
size. Country i’s endowment of low-skilled labor is normalized to one, and its endowment of
high-skilled labor is equal to the world total (and average), eW .
Country i’s income Yi,t is the output produced net of TFP investment costs:
Yi,t = Ti,t · 1 − wt ei,t + wt eW .

(1)

In (1), Ti,t is country i0 s level of TFP. Since the amount of low-skilled workers is normalized
to 1, it is also equal to country i0 s output. wt is the world wage rate for high-skilled workers,
and the investment cost constitutes of wage payments to foreign high-skilled workers. This
formulation for income is admittedly simple, but it is a starting point for the analysis.

3.1

TFP accumulation

All countries have the same technology for TFP accumulation but possibly different starting
levels of TFP. In each country, the TFP investment is chosen by a country planner.
In the model by Nelson and Phelps (1966), advancement of technology depends positively upon investment in education and upon the gap between the best-practice, or frontier,
technology and the technology currently used. This paper follows their formulation, but
views the investment as a general investment in TFP, and allows the importance of technological catch-up to vary by a parameter, γ. Consequently, TFP in country i is accumulated
according to

γ
T̄t
Ti,t+1
=
H(ei,t )
(2)
Ti,t
Ti,t
where the distance to the world TFP frontier is captured by the term TT̄i,tt , and T̄t is the
world average, or frontier, TFP level. Common access to the frontier TFP generates a faster
catch-up the further behind a country is. The parameter γ ∈ [0, 1] measures the strength
of the catch-up effect. The investment in TFP is captured by H(ei,t ), the TFP production
function.
It is assumed that H(ei,t ) is strictly increasing and strictly concave in ei,t . In addition, it
must satisfy the following conditions: H(0) = 1, H 0 (0) = ∞, and H(ei,t ) is bounded above
by b, where b is not too large. The following functional form for H(ei,t )
−κ

1
+1
(3)
H(ei,t ) = (b − 1) 1 +
ei,t
satisfies the conditions while being relatively simple, and this specification of H(ei,t ) will be
used throughout the analysis.
The world TFP average, T̄t , has the form
Z
T̄t ≡

ψ
di
Ti,t

1/ψ

The parameter ψ determines the extent to which T̄t depends on the leading, or frontier, TFP
level in the world. For ψ = 1, T̄t is the arithmetic average of all countries’ TFP levels, and
for ψ = ∞, it is equal to the highest TFP level. The world TFP level grows according to
T̄t+1 = T̄t (1 + gt )
where gt is endogenously determined.
A rewriting of the TFP accumulation function in (2) gives
1−γ γ
Ti,t+1 = Ti,t
T̄t H(ei,t ).

7

(4)

From this expression, it is clear that investments in TFP have dynamic effects, some of
which are specific to the country, as captured by the term Ti,t and others which are international, as captured by T̄t . The parameter γ governs the share of these dynamic effects
which is country-specific. For example, if γ = 1, dynamic gains of TFP investment arise
only through technological catch-up. If γ = 0, dynamic gains of TFP investment are completely internalized within the country. The parameter γ shows to be crucial for the model’s
results, and will be discussed at length below. For comparison, Jones (1998) uses the same
formulation as (2) but views Ti,t as human capital and ei,t as education investment.

where β is the discount factor. The consumer is endowed with 1 unit of low-skilled labor
and eW units of high-skilled labor.

3.3

Country planner problem

The aim of this paper is to explain the distribution of TFP across countries. Therefore, the
model focuses on inter-country relationships and is solved in general equilibrium, while intracountry relationships are given a cursory representation. We do not consider the aggregation
of individual firms’ TFP into country TFP in a given country, and output is specified only
at the country level, as given by the expression in (1). Hence, it is assumed that technology flows freely within countries, and all dynamic effects are internalized within a country.
Therefore, we will characterize the country planner’s solution of the individual country’s
optimization problem. The country planner chooses a sequence of consumption allocations
and investments in TFP so as to maximize consumer utility, taking the sequence of world

prices and average TFP, pt , wt , T̄t t=0 as given. The problem can be stated as follows.

where pt is the time-0 price of the time t good and p0 = 1. The country planner maximizes
utility of consumption given two constraints. The first is the resource constraint, and the
second governs the accumulation of TFP. Since each country is assumed to be small, its TFP
8

choice has no effect on the average TFP level and therefore the country planner takes T̄t as
given.

World equilibrium

A world equilibrium consists of sequences of allocations {Ti,t , Ci,t , ei,t }∞
t=0 for all i and

Condition 2 states that average TFP in the world is consistent with individual countries’
TFP choices. Condition 3 ensures that there is market clearing in the market for high-skilled
labor.

3.5

Initial characterization of a country’s investment decision

In the model, it is assumed that there are perfect world capital markets. This implies that the
interest rates pt /pt+1 are exogenous from the point of view of an individual country. Given
this assumption, each planner’s utility maximization problem can be separated into two
independent problems: an income-maximization problem, and an intertemporal consumption
allocation problem. We state each of them in turn.
In the income-maximization problem, the country planner chooses a sequence of future
investments in TFP so as to maximize output net of investment costs,

in (7) is obtained by inserting the expression for ei,t from (4) into (1) . The term wt eW can
be dropped since it is constant from the individual country’s point of view.
Next, we turn to the intertemporal consumption allocation problem. Given sequences of
prices and country income, {pt , Yi,t }∞

In a world equilibrium, country and world consumption growth between t and t + 1 equals

thus be redefined as follows.
A world equilibrium thus consists of sequences of allocations {Ti,t , Ci,t , ei,t }∞

In Section 5, the world equilibrium will also be defined recursively, for the special case of a
distribution consisting of two groups of countries.

Balanced growth equilibria

This analysis will focus on the long-run world distributions of TFP. Therefore, we restrict
our attention to balanced growth equilibria. A balanced growth equilibrium is a world
equilibrium, as defined in Section 3.5, in which all variables grow at constant rates. There
is a common world growth rate g of T̄t , Ti,t ,Ci,t and wt . The common growth rate allows us
to define a TFP-adjusted wage for high-skilled workers, ŵ:
ŵ ≡

for all t.
Similarly, the relationship in (8) can be rewritten as

Before defining the balanced growth equilibrium, we restate the optimization problem in

Using (9) and the variables thus defined, the country planner’s income-maximization problem
in a balanced growth equilibrium can be stated as follows. The country planner chooses a

(11)

As can be seen from (11), there are three effects of an increase in the relative TFP level on
income. First, there is an increase in investment costs at time t, as captured by the term
on the left-hand side. Second, there is a increase in output at time t + 1, corresponding
to the first term on the right-hand side. Third, there is a decrease in investment costs at
time t + 1, as given by the second term on the right-hand side. The last effect depends
directly on γ. For low values of γ, a large part of the dynamic gains to TFP are countryspecific, and investment in TFP today generates large decreases in future investment costs.
As γ increases, the country-specific gains decrease, and catch-up with the frontier becomes
relatively more important.

4.1

Definition of a balanced growth equilibrium

Formally, a balanced growth equilibrium, a BGE, is a world equilibrium, as defined in Section
3.5, such that pt = β t , ei,t = ei ∀i, t and Ti,t = Ti (1 + g)t ∀i, t for g > 0.
What is the distribution of countries over relative TFP levels in a balanced growth equilibrium? Let this distribution be described by Γ(z), a probability measure on (S, β s ) where
S ∈ [zmin , zmax ] and β s is the associated Borel σ-algebra. This measure will be discussed
further below. Using Γ(z), we can redefine the balanced growth equilibrium in recursive
notation.
11

A balanced growth equilibrium consists of a stationary probability measure Γ(z),
variables ŵ and g, and functions v(z) and E(z) such that

The first and second conditions give the value function and policy function, respectively.
The third condition states that the integral over all relative TFP levels must equal 1. The
fourth condition is the market-clearing condition for high-skilled workers. The last condition
ensures that the probability measure Γ(z) is stationary. Γ(z) is stationary if, for each set
B ∈ β S , the distribution of countries over relative TFP levels is time-invariant.
The astute reader has noticed that the consumption allocation is absent from the definition of the balanced growth equilibrium above. The reason is twofold. First, the relationship
between consumption growth and prices, as specified in (9), is already embedded in the definition of v(z). Second, given the assumption of perfect capital markets, the distribution
of consumption across countries is independent of the relative TFP levels z. In a balanced
growth equilibrium, the level of consumption for a country is given by the consumer’s intertemporal consumption allocation problem. Although consumption growth is identical in
all countries, the level of consumption in a given country depends on initial conditions.
An obvious candidate for a balanced growth equilibrium is one in which all countries
behave identically: a symmetric one. In a symmetric BGE, or SBGE, the measure Γ(z) is
degenerate with all its mass at z = 1. For any other shape of Γ(z) it must be the case that
the function E(z) implies multiple stationary points.1 We will discuss the different possible
outcomes in turn, starting with the SBGE.

Symmetric balanced growth equilibria

A candidate for an SBGE has the following two characteristics. First, all countries choose a
level of employment of high-skilled labor equal to the world average, eW . Second, the world
distribution of country relative TFP levels, Γ(z), is degenerate at zi = 1 for all i, thus it is
trivially unimodal.
In an SBGE, the world growth rate g is determined by (10), which evaluated in zt+1 =
zt = 1 gives
g = H(eW ) − 1.
Is this allocation optimal for each country? The TFP-adjusted wage rate for high-skilled
workers, ŵ, will be such that the first-order condition from the country planner’s optimization
problem is satisfied. Therefore, the Euler equation, (11), gives the wage rate as
ŵ =

βH 0 (eW )
.
(1 + g) (1 − β (1 − γ))

As a result of the symmetry across countries, both g and ŵ are determined by eW , the average
number of high-skilled workers in the world. In addition, ŵ is decreasing in γ whereas g is
independent of γ.
Through the determination of the wage rate, the necessary condition for optimality is
thus satisfied. However, the first-order condition is not automatically sufficient, as the objective function is not necessarily concave. In fact, the concavity of the objective function is
determined by the parameter γ. We resort to numerical solutions for v(z) and E(z) which
show that below a threshold level of γ, the second-order conditions for optimality are not
satisfied at z = 1 and an SBGE does not exist. The following sections contain this analysis.
In Section 5.3, we then consider stability analysis and transitional dynamics.

5.1

A numerical example

To illustrate the characteristics of the balanced growth equilibrium, we provide a numerical
example. The parameter values have been set as follows. The parameter b, which governs
the upper bound of the TFP production function function, is set to 4.5. κ, which governs the
concavity of the function, is set to 0.4. The consumers’ discount factor, β, equals 0.9. The
total number of high-skilled workers in the world, eW , is set to 0.1. Finally, the parameter
governing the weight of frontier countries’ TFP in average TFP, ψ, is set to 1 which implies
that T̄ is an arithmetic average of all Ti ; we briefly discuss the effects of varying ψ in Section
6. Note that at this stage, the parameter values are not chosen to match real-world data.

5.2

Existence in an SBGE: a country’s policy function

Using the numerical example described above, we calculate an individual country planner’s
optimal policy function zt+1 = f (zt ). Figures 1-4 below show the properties of the policy
13

function for different values of γ, under the assumption that all other countries are in a
symmetric balanced growth equilibrium.2 The stationary points depicted are those for which
sufficient conditions for optimality are satisfied.
Figure 1 depicts the case when γ is high, i.e., when technological catch-up is important
for TFP growth. The policy function has a unique stationary point which is the symmetric
equilibrium z = 1.

As γ decreases, the policy function starts to bend downward to the left of z = 1 and
upward to the right of z = 1. This case is shown in Figure 2.

will be discussed in the stability analysis below.

point ceases to exist, while the two asymmetric points remain, albeit further apart.

A more detailed account of how existence of the SBGE depends on γ in our numerical
example is given in Table 1 below.

5.3

Stability and transitional dynamics

The previous section showed that for high values of γ, an SBGE exists. The one-group
model does not exhibit any transitional dynamics around this SBGE. That is, if the initial
distribution of relative TFP levels, zi,0 , is identical for all countries i, then all countries will
15

choose the same investment in TFP in the initial period, eW , and the resulting growth rate
will be identical to that of the SBGE, g, from the beginning of time. If all countries start in
a symmetric equilibrium, the consumption levels of all countries are identical in all periods.
If a country starts with an initial level z0 higher (lower) than 1, it will have a higher (lower)
level of consumption in every period than a country with z0 = 1.3 Next, we want to ascertain
whether the symmetric equilibrium is stable.
There are several kinds of perturbations of countries, or groups of countries, with respect
to which the equilibrium could be stable (or unstable). First, one can determine the stability
with respect to a perturbation of one single country. Thus, one country is given a relative
TFP level z that is slightly different from z = 1, while the rest are at z = 1. What path
will that country then follow? If, and only if, it converges back to z = 1, then the SBGE
is stable with respect to perturbations of a single country. In addition, one can determine
stability with respect to perturbations of groups of countries, where the groups could be of
any size. Now, suppose countries are divided into n groups, of arbitrary size; within a group,
all countries have the same level of z. Suppose that all groups are given initial relative TFP
levels z that are slightly different from z = 1. If all groups converge back to z = 1, then
the SBGE is stable with respect to perturbations of groups of countries. In this analysis, we
will determine the stability of the equilibrium with respect to two kinds of perturbations;
to a perturbation of one country, which we denote measure-zero stability, and to a 2-group
perturbation, denoted 2-group stability.
In order to perform the stability analysis, we define a 2-group recursive world equilibrium in which transitions are possible, i.e., where the equilibrium does not have to exhibit
balanced growth. This definition will also be the point of departure for a characterization of
asymmetric balanced growth equilibria, which are discussed the next section.
Let the two groups have relative TFP levels z1 and z2 . Within a group, all countries are
identical. As in the numerical example, ψ is set to 1, which implies that T̄t is an arithmetic
average of all Ti,t . Let ϕ be the share of countries belonging to group 1, which we denote
the low-TFP group. The group with relative TFP level z2 is denoted the high-TFP group.
1
. Consequently,
The sum of relative TFP levels must equal 1, which implies that z2 = 1−ϕz
1−ϕ
the programming problem can be defined using only one aggregate state variable; z1 . A
recursive 2-group world equilibrium can be defined as follows.
A recursive 2-group world equilibrium consists of v(z, z1 ), E(z, z1 ), w(z1 ), f (z1 ), and
g(z1 ) such that (subscripts i omitted for convenience)

The first and second conditions give the value function and the policy function, respectively, for a country which faces an aggregate relative TFP level z1 and chooses its individual
relative TFP level z. The third condition states the law of motion for the aggregate state
variable z1 . The function f (z1 ) determines the gross aggregate growth rate 1 + gt . The last
condition is the market-clearing condition for high-skilled workers.
5.3.1

Measure-zero stability

To determine whether the symmetric equilibrium is stable with respect to measure-zero
perturbations, we analyze the behavior of an individual country whose relative TFP level
differs slightly from the symmetric steady state value, z = 1. Using the notation introduced
in the definition of the 2-group world equilibrium above, (10) can be restated as
z 0 = z 1−γ

H(E(z, z1 ))
.
f (z1 )

(13)

Measure-zero stability can then be established based on the derivative of (13):

f (z1 )

(14)

where E1 (z, z1 ) is the derivative of the policy function E(z, z1 ) with respect to its first
argument. It is possible to deduce E1 (z, z1 ) from the recursive version of the Euler equation,
(11). By taking the derivative with respect to z, one obtains a second-order equation in
0
E1 (z, z1 ). The two solutions for E1 (z, z1 ) result in a pair of expressions for ∂z
. Saddle-path
∂z
stability corresponds to one expression larger than 1 in absolute value and one expression less
than 1 in absolute value. Evaluating (14) at z1 = z = 1, f (z1 ) = H(eW ), and E(z, z1 ) = eW
yields
∂z 0
H 0 (eW )
E1 (1, 1).

Here, we see that the stability properties of the SBGE will depend heavily on γ.

The roots to the equation in (16) determine the stability of the system with respect to
measure-zero perturbations around the value z = 1. The product of the roots is equal to
1/β, which implies that at least one of the roots is larger than 1. Again, as seen from (17)
the values of the roots depend on γ. We show, using our numerical example, that for high
values of γ, one root is less than 1 in absolute value and one root larger than 1. Hence, the
SBGE is saddle-path stable. This is the case depicted in Figures 1 and 2. For intermediate
values of γ, both roots are larger than 1 in absolute value and, consequently, the SBGE is
unstable. Figure 3 corresponds to this case. Any country with a relative TFP level smaller
than z = 1 will converge to the stationary point to the left of z = 1 and any country with
a relative TFP level larger than z = 1 will converge to the stationary point to the right of
z = 1. For low values of γ, the roots are complex, which contradicts optimality and there
is no SBGE, as shown in Figure 4. Hence, for values of γ below some threshold, a country
whose initial level of TFP is slightly different from z = 1 will not converge to the SBGE.
The measure-zero stability of the numerically calculated examples is listed in Table 1 below.
The stability analysis established that for some values of γ, a single country perturbed
away from the SBGE will not converge to it. The next step is to determine to what relative
TFP level the country will converge. In terms of figures 1-4, these levels correspond to the
stationary points other than z = 1 appearing in some cases. For this purpose, we examine
the stationary version of (11)
z 1−γ =

H 0 (eW )
.
H 0 (H −1 (z γ (1 + g)))

(18)

First, note that this equation is satisfied for z = 1, the symmetric BGE. Moreover, both the
left-hand side and the right-hand side of the equation are increasing in z, indicating that
the equation can have multiple solutions. In our numerical example, we found that when γ
is low, there are at least two additional solutions to (18). This case is depicted in Figures 3
and 4.
Why do the asymmetric stationary points arise? The model exhibits two countervailing
forces; the catch-up effect, which generates convergence, and the dynamic increasing returns,
18

which generates divergence. When technological catch-up is less important, i.e., γ is low, the
divergence effect dominates. Countries with a higher relative TFP level will find it optimal
to invest more in TFP than countries with a lower relative TFP level.

5.3.2

2-group stability

In this section, we examine whether the SBGE is stable with respect to 2-group perturbations.
As in the definition above, all countries are divided into two groups, denoted by their relative
TFP levels: z1 and z2 . The SBGE is stable if a group of countries, when given initial values
of z slightly different from 1, converges back to the SBGE. Suppose that group 1 is given
a TFP level slightly different from z1 = 1. Whether the countries in group 1 will converge
back to z1 = 1 is determined by g(z1 ). The derivative of g(z1 ) is
H 0 (E(z1 , z1 )) (E1 (z1 , z1 ) + E2 (z1 , z1 ))
H(E(z1 , z1 ))

(20)

In Appendix 1, we show that both f 0 (1) and E2 (1, 1) are equal to zero. Hence, (20) is
identical to (15) and, consequently, the 2-group stability analysis yields conclusions identical
to those of the measure-zero stability analysis; for values of γ below a certain threshold,
a group of countries whose initial levels of TFP are slightly different from z = 1 will not
converge to the SBGE. The 2-group stability of the numerically calculated examples is shown
in Table 1.

The table shows computed SBGE for values of γ ranging from 0.216 to 0.226. The
growth rate g is equal to 1.34 for all symmetric BGE since it is independent of γ. This
rate is very high, but is a result of the choice of parameter values for the function H(e).
The TFP-adjusted wage rate ŵ is decreasing in γ. Symmetry across countries implies that
the amount of high-skilled labor employed in TFP accumulation is 0.1 , which is equal to
the average amount of high-skilled workers in the world. The two last columns in Table 1
indicate whether the equilibrium is stable or not. For γ = 0.224 or higher, the equilibrium
is stable. However, as γ decreases, it becomes unstable, and finally, for γ = 0.214 or lower,
the equilibrium ceases to exist.

Asymmetric balanced growth equilibria

An asymmetric balanced growth equilibrium, an ABGE, is one in which all variables grow
at constant rates and there is more than one level of relative TFP chosen by the country
planners. We will focus on a particular type of ABGE, namely 2-group BGE. These are
“natural” outcomes (as opposed to outcomes with more than two groups), as will be argued
below.

6.1

2-group balanced growth equilibria

The 2-group BGE is a specific case of the 2-group world equilibrium defined in Section 5,
in which the growth rate is constant: Ti,t = Ti (1 + g)t ∀i, t for g > 0. Since there are no
transitional dynamics by definition in a BGE, we can omit the aggregate state variable z1
from the optimization problem.
A recursive 2-group balanced growth equilibrium consists of v(z), E(z), w(z1 ),
f (z1 ), and g(z1 ) such that

The first and second conditions give the value function and the policy function, respectively. The third condition ensures that the 2-group distribution is stationary. The function
f (z1 ) determines the constant gross aggregate growth rate 1 + g. In the ABGE, the world
growth rate is determined by the division of high-skilled labor into the low- and high-TFP
groups, and the relative size of the two groups. In addition, it depends on γ, whereas the
growth rate in the SBGE is independent of γ. The last condition is the market-clearing
condition for high-skilled workers.
Let e1 and e2 be the amount of high-skilled labor employed in the low-TFP group and
the high-TFP group, respectively. The unknown parameters e1 , e2 , and ϕ are determined
by combining the Euler equations in steady state, (18), for both groups

with the market-clearing condition for high-skilled labor ( condition 5 in (21)). This system of
two equations is underdetermined; it has one more unknown than equations. Consequently,
if one solution exists, there are infinitely many solutions, indeed a whole continuum. Each
solution has a corresponding distinct world growth rate, and TFP-adjusted wage rate for
high-skilled labor.
Equation (22) allows us to identify a key necessary condition for a 2-group ABGE to
1−γ
exist: what is required is non-monotonicity of H(e) γ H 0 (e). Whether or not there is nonmonotonicity depends on the primitives γ and H(e). Since H is increasing and strictly
concave, there are opposing forces, as a straightforward derivative of this expression reveals.
We do not attempt to provide general conditions on H and γ that satisfy the necessary nonmonotonicity here; for the specific functional form for H we consider in this paper, however,
non-monotonicity is satisfied in a range (0, γ̄), with γ̄ < 1.
Also, note that for ABGEs with more than 2 groups, when there is non-monotonicity,
for a generic e, there is an odd number of solutions to (22). Here, stability arguments (like
those discussed in Section 5.3) make us focus on 2 (as opposed to 3) groups. We have not
fully analyzed the case where (22) would admit more than 3 (say, 5) solutions, but such a
possibility does at least not seem feasible with the functional form for H used here.

The assumption of free movement of high-skilled labor across countries ensures that
the wage rate paid to high-skilled workers is identical in the two groups. Therefore, the
TFP-adjusted wage rate can be obtained from the Euler equation for either group. In the
asymmetric equilibrium, the wage rate depends on the relative TFP levels as well as the
division of high-skilled labor across the two groups.
As in the symmetric one, the asymmetric equilibrium has consumption growth that is
identical for both groups and thus for all countries, but the level of consumption in a given
country depends on its total income and on initial conditions. All countries in the low-TFP
group will have a lower total income, and hence a lower level of consumption than countries
in the high-TFP group. If all countries start in the asymmetric equilibrium, countries within
the same group will have identical consumption levels.

Table 2 displays, for each value of γ, the characteristics of the symmetric and asymmetric
BGE. For the symmetric BGE, it shows whether the equilibrium is stable along with its
growth rate g. For the asymmetric BGE, it shows the resulting values for the “gap”, i.e., the
ratio of TFP between the low-and high-TFP group, as well as ŵ, g, and ϕ. The indeterminacy
of the system of equations in the 2-group BGE implies that the numerical solutions entail
22

ranges of values for the parameters. The table shows that for values of γ of 0.226 or higher,
only the symmetric BGE exists, and it is stable. For γ equal to 0.220, the symmetric BGE
is unstable, and a there exists a continuum of asymmetric BGE.4 As γ decreases to 0.214
or less, the symmetric BGE ceases to exist, while the asymmetric BGE remain. Within the
group of ABGE, the table shows that the growth rate g decreases in γ.
From Table 2 we can conclude that if technological catch-up is important for TFP growth,
i.e., γ is high, the distribution of TFP is symmetric. If, instead, technological catch-up is less
important, i.e., γ is low, the distribution of TFP is asymmetric: twin-peaked. As mentioned
above, the intuition for the rise of asymmetric BGE is that for sufficiently low values of
γ, the dynamic increasing returns effect (which creates divergence) dominates the catch-up
effect (which creates convergence). This implies that countries with a higher relative TFP
level will find it optimal to invest more in TFP than countries with a lower relative TFP
level. The former are technological leaders while the latter are technological laggards that
benefit from technology spillovers from the leaders. If the countries have different initial
TFP levels, then countries with lower initial relative TFP will invest less, such that they
eventually reach z1 , which constitutes the low-TFP group of the ABGE. Similarly, countries
with higher initial relative TFP will invest more, such that they eventually reach z2 , which
constitutes the high-TFP group.5
Let us return to the parameterization of ψ, which governs the weight of frontier countries’
TFP in the world average TFP level. In our numerical example, ψ = 1 and T̄ is an arithmetic
average of all Ti . It is conceivable that frontier countries’ TFP could have a larger weight in
world average TFP, which would correspond to ψ > 1. How would that affect the equilibria
of the model? In an SBGE, all countries have identical TFP levels, and the value of ψ has
no effect on the average world TFP. In an ABGE, countries’ relative TFP levels differ, and
ψ does affect the world average TFP, T̄ , and its rate of growth, g. An increase in ψ increases
g which, in turn, decreases ŵ as seen in (23). However, an individual country takes T̄ as
given and therefore ψ does not affect the country’s optimal choice of e, the amount of skilled
workers to employ. The system of equations determining the 2-group ABGE, given by (22)
and condition 5 in (21), is unaffected by ψ and so are the range of ABGE calculated in our
numerical example. Since an increase in ψ affects g and ŵ it also affects the out-of-steadystate dynamics, but we have not analyzed this effect in any more detail.
4

For a small range of values for γ, symmetric and asymmetric BGE coexist. Within that range, as γ
decreases, the symmetric BGE goes from being stable to unstable.
5
If all countries start at the same initial TFP level, our conjecture is that they will split up into two
groups, one which starts to invest less, such that it eventually reaches z1 , and one which starts to invest
more, such that it eventually reaches z2 . In the initial period, the sequence of wages and relative TFP levels,
∞
{wt , zt }t=0 , must be such that the countries are indifferent between joining the low- and the high-TFP
groups, and that they choose to split up into groups of relative size which is consistent with the ABGE.

Stability properties of the ABGE

To ascertain whether the asymmetric balanced growth equilibria are stable, we perform the
same type of stability analyses as for the symmetric balanced growth equilibria: measure-zero
stability and 2-group stability.
6.3.1

Measure-zero stability

An ABGE characterized by the triplet e1 , e2 , and ϕ is stable with respect to measure-zero
perturbations if a single country, which is given an initial relative TFP level slightly different
from z1 , converges back to z1 , and a single country perturbed away from z2 converges back
0
, as given by (14),
to z2 . Whether the country converges back or not is determined by ∂z
∂z
evaluated at z = z1 and z = z2 , respectively. As in the case of the measure-zero stability
analysis of the SBGE, the derivative of the recursive version of (11) with respect to z gives
0
a second-order equation in E1 (z, z1 ) which results in a pair of expressions for ∂z
. This pair
∂z
is then evaluated at both z1 and z2 . We compute measure-zero stability for the ABGE in
the numerical example characterized above, and Table 3 below displays the results.
6.3.2

2-group stability

An ABGE characterized by the triplet e1 , e2 , and ϕ is stable with respect to 2-group perturbations if the following holds: when the low-TFP group is given an initial relative TFP level
slightly different from z1 , it converges back to z1 . (Since a perturbation of one group affects
the remaining group, it is sufficient to analyze perturbations of one group only.) Suppose
that the low-TFP group is perturbed away from z1 . Whether it will converge back to z1 is
determined by the derivative of g(z1 ), as given by (19).
Unlike the in SBGE, the derivatives f 0 (z1 ) and E2 (z1 , z1 ) are not equal to zero, and must
therefore be solved for in order to evaluate g 0 (z1 ). To that end, we compute the derivative
with respect to z1 of the recursive version of (11), and evaluate it at z = z1 and z = z2 ,
respectively. Combining the resulting two equations with the expressions for f 0 (z1 ), g 0 (z1 ),
and the derivative with respect to z1 of condition 5 in (12), we obtain a system of 5 equations.
There are five unknowns; f 0 (z1 ), g 0 (z1 ), E2 (z1 , z1 ), E2 (z2 , z1 ), and w0 (z1 ). The system yields
a second-order equation in E2 (z1 , z1 ) and therefore has two solutions. We solve the system of
equations, and for each solution obtain an expression for g 0 (z1 ); see Appendix 1 for details.
If one of the expressions is larger than 1 in absolute value, and one is less than 1 in absolute
value, there is saddle-path stability. We compute the values of g 0 (z1 ) for the ABGE in the
numerical example characterized above, and the results are reported in Table 3.

TFP shocks

In this section, the model is extended to allow for country-specific shocks to TFP. The
motivation for this extension is twofold. First, it is to create a more smooth and realistic
world TFP distribution where individual countries can move between groups and potentially
experience both growth miracles and growth disasters. Second, it is an attempt to eliminate
the indeterminacy of the asymmetric steady states obtained in the baseline model.

7.1

Model

The following assumptions are added to the model described in Section 3. Each country is
subject to a TFP shock εi,t , ε ∈ {εL , εH } where εL < εH . The probability of a good shock
is denoted P (εH ) = π. The shock ε is iid across countries and across time. The country
planner sets ei,t before observing the shock εi,t . With TFP shocks, the accumulation of TFP
has the following form
1−γ γ
Ti,t+1 = (1 + εi,t ) Ti,t
T̄t H(ei,t )
which is (4) with the addition of the shock εi,t .
It is also assumed that the world has perfect consumption insurance and frictionless
borrowing and lending. This ensures that a separation of the optimization problem into
an income-maximization problem and an intertemporal consumption allocation problem is
still valid. The intertemporal consumption allocation problem is the same as the one in the
model without technology shocks, and the resulting allocation will be the same, given total
income. However, the income-maximization problem is different, as will be described below.

25

7.2

A country’s investment decision

As in the model without shocks, we restrict our attention to balanced growth equilibria. In
the income-maximization problem, the country planner chooses an investment in TFP so as
to maximize output net of investment costs. The recursive formulation of the optimization
problem is
0
v(z) = max z − ŵe + β(πv(zH
) + (1 − π)v(zL0 ))

The country planner employs an amount e of high-skilled workers in a given time period.
With probability π the country is hit by a positive shock, and the resulting next period

and the corresponding value function is v(zH
relative TFP level is zH
1 − π the country is hit by a negative shock, and the resulting next period relative TFP level
is zL0 , associated with the value function v(zL0 ).

7.3

Definition of a balanced growth equilibrium

A balanced growth equilibrium is a world equilibrium, where all variables grow at rate g
on average. Individual countries can have a TFP growth that is faster or slower than this
average rate g. The distribution of z is constant. As in the model without shocks, let Γ(z)
be a probability measure on (S, β s ) where S ∈ [zmin , zmax ] and β s is the associated Borel
σ-algebra. ψ is set to 1, which implies that T̄ is an arithmetic average of all Ti .6
A balanced growth equilibrium consists of a stationary probability measure Γ(z),
variables ŵ and g, and functions v(z) and E(z) such that

Readers familiar with the contributions of Bewley (undated), Huggett (1993), and Aiyagari (1994) will
recognize a similarity of the steady-state analyses of consumer inequality there with the balanced growth
equilibrium with country inequality here. A technical difference between these is that there are two unknown
long-run quantities here—the real wage and the endogenous growth rate—as opposed to only one—the real
wage (or, alternatively, the real interest rate)—in those settings.

The first and second conditions give the value function and policy function, respectively.
The third condition states that the growth rate g must be such that the integral over all
relative TFP levels equals 1. The fourth condition states that the wage ŵ must be such that
there is market clearing in the market for high-skilled workers. The last condition ensures
that the probability measure Γ(z) is stationary.

7.4

A numerical example

The model with TFP shocks is solved numerically using the parameterization in the example
applied to the baseline model. There are three additional parameters values to be set; π,
εL , and εH . π is set to 0.5, implying that the TFP shock is high and low with equal
probability. The size of the shock is chosen such that the shock is symmetric; εL = −0.05
and εH = 0.05. Numerical solutions are then obtained for different values of γ; the solution
method is described in Appendix A2. Figures 5-7 below depict the world distribution of
relative TFP levels zi corresponding to γ=0.24, 0.225, and 0.22, respectively. From the
results obtained in this numerical example, the equilibrium appears to be unique for a given
value of γ.

27

Figure 5 shows the world distribution of zi for γ=0.24. The distribution is single-peaked.
As a result of the TFP shocks, there is significant dispersion around the center value z = 1,
creating the smooth symmetric shape of the distribution.
Figure 5: γ = 0.24

When γ is decreased to 0.225, as displayed in Figure 6, the distribution is still singlepeaked but the dispersion has increased, some countries lag behind, while others are at much
higher relative TFP levels.
Figure 6: γ = 0.225

Figure 7 shows that for γ as low as 0.22, the distribution of TFP is asymmetric; it is
twin-peaked. One group of countries has settled at a low TFP level, and another at a high
TFP level. As countries are hit by shocks, it is possible for a given country to move from one
of the groups to the other. However, the distribution of countries over TFP levels remains
constant. We can conclude that for high values of γ, the distribution is single-peaked, while
for sufficiently low values of γ the distribution of countries is twin-peaked.

28

Figure 7: γ = 0.22

Even though an individual country’s TFP grows at rate g on average, its consumption
grows at rate g for all t. The relative levels of consumption are determined by initial conditions. All countries which start at the same initial relative TFP level z0 have the same
consumption level. A country which starts at a higher (lower) initial level has a higher
(lower) level of consumption in each time period.
How do the results from the model with TFP shocks compare to the model without
shocks? The numerical results show that with shocks, the balanced growth equilibrium
appears to be unique for a given value of γ, whereas without shocks, the model produced
a continuum of asymmetric equilibria. However, the main results from the baseline model
remain; if technological catch-up is important for TFP growth, (γ is high), the distribution
of TFP is symmetric. If, instead, technological catch-up is less important, (γ is low), the
distribution of TFP is asymmetric: twin-peaked.

Changes in the distribution of world TFP

The distribution of world TFP is not constant over time. Three snapshots of the distribution
of labor productivity, measured as log (PPP-adjusted) output per worker, from Acemoglu
(2009) are depicted in Figure 8 below.7

The distributions are based on kernel density estimates.

also that these numbers refer to PPP-adjusted quantities, thus diﬀerences in consumption do
not (at least in principle) reflect the fact that the same bundle of consumption goods costs
diﬀerent amounts in diﬀerent countries. The PPP adjustment corrects for these diﬀerences
and attempts to measure the variation in real consumption. Therefore, the richest countries
are not only producing more than thirty times as much as the poorest countries, but are
also consuming thirty times as much. Similarly, cross-country diﬀerences in health are quite
remarkable; while life expectancy at birth is as high as 80 in the richest countries, it is only
between 40 and 50 in many sub-Saharan African nations. These gaps represent huge welfare
diﬀerences.
Understanding how some countries can be so rich while some others are so poor is one
of the most important, perhaps the most important, challenges facing social science. It
is important both because these income diﬀerences have major welfare consequences and
because a study of these striking diﬀerences will shed light on how the economies of diﬀerent
nations function and sometimes how they fail to function.
The emphasis on income diﬀerences across countries implies neither that income per
capita can be used as a “suﬃcient statistic” for the welfare of the average citizen nor that it
is the only feature that we should care about. As we will discuss in detail later, the eﬃciency
properties of the market economy (such as the celebrated First Welfare Theorem or Adam

We observed marked twin peaks in 1980 and more dispersion in 2000, though here the
peak on the left is less clear, whereas the 1960 distribution shows only weak signs of bimodality. Whether there are two peaks or not, these distributions are different, and the
general question we ask here is what fundamental determinants lie behind the shape of the
distribution of TFP generated by our model. We will, in turn, and very briefly, discuss
some of the determinants: changes in γ, changes in trading costs for e, changes in H, and
transitional dynamics.8

8.1

The value of γ

7

First, we saw above that γ is a key determinant of whether bimodality is an outcome in our
model; low values are required, ceteris paribus, for bimodality, and generally speaking a lower
γ tends to make the distribution more dispersed. Thus, a move toward bimodality/more
dispersion might be interpreted as a decrease in γ. What, then, is γ exactly? We have
remained deliberately vague on this, and the Nelson-Phelps setting indeed is “ad hoc”: it is
not derived from first (technological) principles. As specified, γ captures two features at once.
First, it captures something that we might label a technology (either physical technology or
information technology), i.e., how easily transferable TFP knowledge is from the world to a
given economy. With this interpretation, a fall in γ means weaker transferability. Given the
rise of IT technology and, more generally, globalization, this interpretation would suggest
that γ has risen, as opposed to fallen. The other feature γ captures, however, is how much of
the TFP investments are internalized, as opposed to how much they are treated as exogenous.
Here, in contrast, at least to the extent that countries are able to better coordinate action
across countries, and perhaps also better internalize TFP externalities that occur within a
given country, one would argue that a fall in γ over this period is a reasonable assumption.
A conclusion from this discussion is that one would, perhaps, want a model that goes beyond
8

Other primitives, such as β and eW or the nature of the shocks to TFP, can also influence TFP distributions, but we include no analysis of them here.

30

the simple Nelson-Phelps formulation by making the distinction between transferability (a
technology/information concern) and the degree of internalization of the dynamics of TFP
(a concern about how well countries are able to do this locally and how well they are able
to coordinate between them).

8.2

Trading costs

Globalization was argued above to at least potentially be a determinant of γ. However,
since γ also captures other important model features, a cleaner experiment is to consider a
decrease in the costs of trading. Our theory so far assumes that e is an input that is traded
in world markets at a competitively determined price. Consider instead the polar opposite
case, namely that where e cannot be traded at all. Thus, with symmetric endowments, all
countries would invest the same amount, eW , in TFP accumulation. The TFP accumulation
equation thus reads
1−γ γ
T̄t H(eW ),
Ti,t+1 = Ti,t
which can be rewritten as
Ti,t+1
=
T̄t+1

since T̄ grows at rate H(eW ). Thus, relative TFPs converge to one: there is global convergence. More generally, based on the comparison of the extreme cases, with trade costs in
the fundamental input into the accumulation of TFP, we would thus expect to see a force
toward convergence. A fall in trade costs would then produce a force away from convergence
and toward the bimodal distribution of world TFP.

8.3

Other model parameters and transitional dynamics

We saw in Section 6.1 that the function H, which translates TFP investment input, e, into
TFP growth, is an important determinant behind the distribution of world TFP; recall, e.g.,
that aγ necessary condition for bimodality in an ABGE based on interior solutions is that
H(e) 1−γ H 0 (e) be non-monotonic. First, notice that if H is flat, i.e., H(e) does not depend on
e, asymmetric outcomes are never possible. Thus, if “R&D has become more productive”,
perhaps due to basic exogenous technical change, we would see a force toward bimodality.
The shape of H would matter too, and using our functional form for H, it appears that
higher curvature, i.e., more rapidly decreasing returns, also is a force toward bimodality.
Finally, transitional dynamics can of course explain changes in the TPF distribution.
That is, suppose that there are no changes in primitives but that these primitives imply a
bimodal long-run outcome, and suppose that the initial TFP distribution is a unimodal one
with less inequality in TFP than observed currently. Then we would see something like the
observed changes play out over time. However, this requires additional understanding of the
origins of the initial distribution. These origins, in turn, are likely due to technology, or
31

information, or “country organization” being different in the present than the past. Again
take the trade costs as an example: if no trade is possible, we would see an outcome of equal
TFP in all countries, and if trade were made possible, there would then be gradual movement
from an equal to an unequal TFP distribution. A similar history would likely be generated
if TFP shocks were very minor in the past but have become significant now, or if H was flat
in the past (R&D was unproductive) but is upward-sloping in modern economies.9

Concluding comments

This paper tries to answer the question: if there is technological catch-up, as proposed
by Nelson and Phelps (1966), and each country takes this into account while maximizing
the utility of its citizens, what is the resulting equilibrium distribution of TFP? To this
end, the paper presents a general equilibrium model in which individual countries invest
in a technology-enhancing input that is traded in world markets, and the accumulation of
TFP is modeled according to the Nelson-Phelps specification. Even though all countries are
treated symmetrically, the model can generate a nontrivial long-run world distribution of
TFP. The model predicts that if technological catch-up is important for TFP growth, the
distribution of countries over relative TFP is symmetric. If, instead, technological catch-up
less important for TFP growth, the distribution is asymmetric: twin-peaked. There is one
group of countries with high TFP in relative terms, with the remainder of the countries
operating at a much lower relative TFP level. All countries grow at the same rate, but the
high-TFP countries invest more in technology than do low-TFP countries. The catch-up term
thus allows the low-TFP countries to grow at the same rate and not fall further behind in
relative terms. More generally, independently of whether bimodality is an important feature
of the data, the present model does produce equilibrium world distributions of TFP that
display more or less dispersion depending on the fundamental parameters of the model, and
the same parameters that tend to generate bimodality tend also to produce more dispersion.
The analysis we present is only a first attempt at a theory of the world distribution of
country TFP. A serious quantitative analysis would require moving toward a model with
(i) capital accumulation; (ii) some extent of incomplete insurance against TFP shocks; and,
last but not least, (iii) geographical detail, so that large countries are different than small
countries (and, say, there is heterogeneity in γs). Such extensions would be very interesting
to pursue in future work.
9

Looking at a recent period, and based on a model similar in spirit to that in Greenwood and Yorukoglu
(1997), Beaudry, Collard and Green (2005) conclude that demographic change accounts for a large part of
the transitional changes in the distribution of world income. This is likely to be an important factor also in
an extended version of the present model.

2-group stability of the ABGE

As in the case of the SBGE, 2-group stability is given by (25). In order to evaluate g 0 (z1 )
in a given ABGE, the derivatives E1 (z1 , z1 ), E2 (z1 , z1 ), and f 0 (z1 ) must be computed. We
solve for E1 (z1 , z1 ) and E1 (z2 , z1 ) by evaluating (28) at z = 1 and z = 2, respectively. The
expression for E1 (z1 , z1 ) corresponding to the stable root is inserted into g 0 (z1 ). Inspection
of (26) reveals that when evaluated at z = z1 it does not imply that E2 (z1 , z1 ) = 0. Consequently, f 0 (z1 ) is not zero, and both E2 (z1 , z1 ) and f 0 (z1 ) must be computed. In order to
solve for g 0 (z1 ), we construct the following system of equations. The first two equations are
the derivative with respect to z1 of the recursive version of the Euler equation, (27), evaluW
= 0. Combining
ated at z = z1 and z = z2 , respectively. The third equation states that ∂e

these equations with f (z1 ) and g (z1 ) yields the following system of five equations:

The system has five unknown variables: f 0 (z1 ), g 0 (z1 ), E2 (z1 , z1 ), E2 (z2 , z1 ), and w0 (z1 ).
This system yields a second-order equation in E2 (z1 , z1 ). Therefore, it has two solutions,
and two corresponding expressions for g 0 (z1 ). If, for a given triplet e1 , e2 , and ϕ, one of the
expressions is larger than 1 in absolute value and the other one smaller than 1 in absolute
value, then the ABGE exhibits saddle-path stability.

Appendix A2
Solution method for the model with TFP shocks
The solution method used is similar to the one in Aiyagari (1994) albeit with two unknown
variables, g and ŵ. The value function is obtained using global search over a discrete grid.
Between grid points, the functions are interpolated with a cubic spline. The method involves
the following steps. Start with an initial guess for g and ŵ. Solve the dynamic programming
problem using the guess and obtain the policy function E(z). Simulate an individual country’s choice of e and the resulting z for T time periods, where T is very large. Use the data
generated to check whether condition 4 in (24) is satisfied. If not, update the guess for ŵ
using the bisection method and repeat the procedure until condition 4 holds. Then, check
whether condition 3 in (24) is satisfied. If not, update the guess for g using the bisection
method. Given the new guess for g, find the ŵ for which condition 4 is satisfied. Given this
combination of ŵ and g, check whether condition 3 holds. If not, update the guess for g.
Repeat the procedure until both conditions 3 and 4 in (24) are satisfied.
