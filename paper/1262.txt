Incentive Effects of Taxes on Income from Capital:
Alternative Policies in the 1980's

ABSTRACT

In this paper, we evaluate existing tax law as of 1980, President
Reagan's tax reform initiatives as enacted in the Economic Recovery Tax
Act of 1981 (ERTA) and the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of

1982 (TEFRA), as well as other proposals that were not enacted. For
each law, we measure marginal effective total tax rates for capital in
the corporate sector, the noncorporate sector, and the owner-occupied
housing sector. These rates include taxation under the corporate income
tax, the personal income tax, and property taxes, in order to capture
the full distortion of individuals' choices between present and future
consumption as well as the distortions in the choice of investment.
Effective tax rates in 1980 were perceived as high in the corporate

sector, at least partly because of inflation, and especially when
compared to the tax-free treatment of imputed rents from owner-occupied
housing. In contrast, we find that (1) the total effective tax rate in
the corporate sector was only 35 percent, about half of the rate in some

previous estimates; (2) the total effective tax in the noncorporate
sector was 36 percent, higher than in the corporate sector; (3) the
total effective tax in owner-occupied housing was 19 percent, because of
a higher relative property tax rate; and (4) under either 1980 or 1982
law, the marginal effective total tax rate does not rise with inflation
in any sector or for the economy as a whole. By 1982 the rate in the
corporate sector fell to 30 percent, by more than in other sectors.

I. Introduction

A major goal of tax policy in recent years has been to increase
saving, investment, and the productivity of American workers.

To a

great extent, the perceived success of President Reagan's tax program
will depend upon its long run effects on total capital formation. Many

economists and an increasing number of policymakers, however, are
becoming concerned not just with the total amount of capital but with
the efficiency of its use.

The amount of capital formation is influenced by the overall rate of

taxation of capital income. By imposing a wedge between the gross and
net returns to a capital asset, taxes lower the incentives to save and

invest. Taxes thus impose an intertemporal distortion, since a given
sacrifice of current consumption provides less return in the form of
future consumption than would be true in the absence of taxation.

Examination of the effectiveness of the Reagan tax cuts, however,
should also focus on their impact on the efficiency of the allocation of

capital across assets and industries. If there were no taxes, investors

would tend to seek the most productive investments and combine them
efficiently. By contrast, the current tax system contains many diverse

features that create very high effective rates of tax on some
investments and very low rates of tax or even subsidy on others.
Investors are attracted to lightly taxed investments at the expense of
highly taxed investments, and the otherwise efficient use of capital is

disrupted. Tax differentials tend to change the allocation of capital
away from its most productive allocation. As a result, the total value

of output is reduced. Moreover, these efficiency costs arise even if

-2-

overall incentives increase the total stock of capital in the long run.

Some of these distortions involve the allocation of financial
capital. Corporations receive deductions for interest payments but not
for retained earnings or dividends, so they have an artificial incentive

to use debt rather than equity finance.

Within equity, because of

additional personal taxes on dividends, corporations may have an
artificial incentive to retain rather than distribute their earnings.
Individuals have incentives from the tax system to invest in municipal

rather than corporate bonds and to save through pensions rather than
regular savings accounts. All of these misallocations bear costs, as do
misallocations in terms of who saves and who bears risk.

In this paper, we largely ignore these distortions in the allocation
of financial capital, in order to concentrate instead on distortions in

the allocation of real capital.

We investigate corporate and

noncorporate firms' or individuals' decisions regarding the use of
various kinds of equipment, structures, inventories, land and rental or
owner-occupied housing.

Differential tax rates on •such assets arise

because only equipment receives an investment tax credit, because
inventories and land receive no special allowances, and because there is

no taxation on the imputed return to owner-occupied housing. Effective

tax rates may differ even within one of these categories, as when the
same rate of investment tax credit is granted to machines with different
useful service lives, or when the same depreciation schedule is assigned

to assets that actually wear out at different rates.

Because of

different taxes in the corporate and noncorporate sectors, further
distortions arise in the allocation of real capital between sectors or

-3-

among the various industries.

In this paper, we evaluate existing tax law as of 1980, President
Reagan's tax reform initiatives as enacted in the Economic Recovery Tax

Act of 1981 (ERTA) and the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of

1982 (TEFRA), as well as other proposals that were not enacted.

For

each law, we measure marginal effective total tax rates for capital in

the corporate sector, the noncorporate sector, and the owner-occupied
housing sector. These rates include taxation under the corporate income

tax, the personal income tax, and property taxes, in order to capture
the full distortion of individuals' choices between present and future
consumption as well as the distortions in the choice of investment.'

A. General Results about the Taxation of Capital

We obtain four rather surprising results regarding the taxation of
capital.

First, we find a lower effective tax rate on capital than

might have been predicted on the basis of previous studies. The average
effective total tax rate in the corporate sector, including all observed

taxes on past investment, has been estimated at about 70 percent prior

to the Reagan tax cuts.2 Several studies have indicated that the
marginal effective corporate tax rate in 1980, including only corporate
taxes on equity-financed marginal investments, was about 33 percent.3 In

This study emphasizes changes in capital cost recovery and in the
investment tax credit under ERTA and TEFRA. These laws also lowered
marginal personal income tax rates and affected other features of the
tax law regarding saving. We do not consider these other effects in
this study.
2 See Feldstein, Dicks-Hireaux and Poterba (1983) and also Feldstein and
Summers (1979).

-4-

the current study we add personal taxes and property taxes and we assume

that the marginal investment is financed by the average mix of equity

and debt. Here, the corporate sector has an overall rate of about 35

percent in 1980," but the low taxation of the large owner-occupied

housing sector pulls the marginal rate for the economy down to 29
percent. Under 1982 law, these rates are 30 percent for the corporate
sector and only 26 percent for all capital income in the economy.

Second, while any given asset would be taxed more in the corporate

sector than in the noncorporate sector, the mean rate in the
noncorporate sector is higher than the mean rate in the corporate
sector. This reversal occurs because the noncorporate sector has more
weight on highly taxed assets such as land and structures.

Third, we find a tax rate on owner-occupied housing of 19 percent.
This is contrary to the common perception that owner-occupied housing

faces zero taxation as a result of exemption of imputed rents. While
this feature certainly serves to lower the effective tax rate in this
sector, property taxes are levied at a higher rate on housing than on
industrial capital. With the lower-than-perceived tax rate on corporate

capital and the higher-than-perceived tax rate on housing, our study
suggests that the differential between tax rates in the two sectors was
less dramatic than some architects of ERTA might have believed.

See Gravelle (1982), and Hulten and Robertson (1982), and Fullerton
and Henderson (1983).
'4

Our finding for the corporate sector is close to the 37 percent rate
found by King and Fullerton (1984). Fullerton (1984) catalogues
reasons why average total tax rates may differ from marginal total tax
rates.

-5-

Fourth, inflation adds to taxes in the corporate sector because of
historical cost depreciation, taxation of nominal capital gains, and tax
rules for insurance companies, but it subtracts from total taxes because

the corporate rate for nominal interest deductions exceeds the personal
rate at which nominal interest is taxed. Here, as in King and Fullerton

(1984), we find that taxes on corporate equipment and structures
increase with inflation.

When we add assets that do not receive

depreciation allowances, such as corporate land and owner-occupied
housing, we find that nominal interest deductions are important. Total
taxes in the economy are invariant to inflation, even though disparities

in the tax treatments of different assets increase with inflation. The
approximate constancy of capital taxation contrasts with the findings of

Feldstein and Summers (1979), who found sharp increases in tax rates as
a result of inflation.

B. Summary of Tax Rates in the 1980's

We find that the 1981 law, if it had been left in place through 1986,

would have greatly reduced the cost-of-capital in all industries except

owner-occupied housing. This law would have caused major reductions in
intertemporal distortions, thus promoting expansion of the capital stock

in the long run.

Capital costs for most types of equipment, however,

would have been reduced much more than costs for structures, land, or
inventories.

interasset

As a result, the 1981 law would have introduced major

distortions which

increase with

the elasticity

of

substitution among assets. The 1982 law abortd the transition to lower

capital costs. Effects are similar to those of the ultimate 1981 law,

but they are smaller.

Nevertheless, the reductions in the cost of

-6-

business capital are still significant.

The overall reduction in

taxation should help to spur investment in the long run, as intended by
the architects of the Reagan program.5
Our study also examines tax reforms that have been advanced by others

in recent years. The Auerbach-JorgenSOfl (1980) proposal, because it

allows economic depreciation at replacement cost, would result in
uniform capital costs across assets.

Interasset distortions would be

eliminated1 and the efficiency gain from this reform could be expected

to increase with the assumed substitution elasticity among assets.

Corporate firms would still be taxed differently from noncorporate
firms, so intersectoral distortions would

remain dependent on the

intersectoral substitution elasticity.

If the corporate income tax were repealed, corporations would no

longer receive investment tax credits,

accelerated depreciation

allowances, interest deductions, or property tax deductions. As in King

and Fullerton (1984), we find that elimination of the corporate tax
would reduce taxes in the corporate sector by 2 percentage points under
l98O law, but it would raise effective tax rates and capital costs under
1982 law.

Thus the corporate "tax" is really a marginal subsidy, but

variations in capital costs remain high.

Integration with personal

taxes, on the other hand, does not eliminate credits and deductions.

Our aim is to measure the long run consequences of tax reform.
Changes in monetary policy between 1980 and 1982 might have altered
observed interest rates and inflation rates, and therefore might have
offset (or reinforced) the impact of the accelerated cost recovery
provisions on effective tax rates. We are not concerned with such
factors, however, because we do not attempt to measure tax rates in
1982 as opposed to 1980. Rather, we look at the difference between
the tax laws, holding all other economic variables constant.

—7—

All taxable corporate income would be passed through to the stockholders

and would be taxed only at their personal rates. Overall capital costs

would fall slightly, but the variation among capital costs would fall
dramatically.

C. The Rest of the Paper
Section II discusses each alternative tax regime in more detail.

It

refers to the Technical Appendix for a discussion of the uses of costof-capital data in examining economic efficiency and for a derivation of

capital cost formulas for each asset in each sector.

These capital

costs, or required pre-tax rates of return, are sometimes difficult to
interpret by themselves. For this reason, when we report the results of

our calculations we always compare this pre-tax return to a fixed real

after-tax return. The difference, as a fraction of the pre-tax return,

is an effective tax rate measure which includes corporate taxes,
personal taxes, and property taxes. Section II includes results for all

assets in the corporate sector under each tax regime, and Section III

goes on to consider the noncorporate sector and housing. Section IV
then investigates the sensitivity of results to alternative assumptions.
We measure the effect of inflation by plotting the overall effective tax

rate as a function of the inflation rate. Section V is a conclusion.

II. Alternative Tax Regimes

We use cost-of-capital formulas like those in Hall and Jorgenson
(1967) to measure the marginal cost of capital for each asset under each

tax regime. These formulas are derived in the Technical Appendix, but

-8-

they can be summarized here. We also introduce notation in the text, in

order to discuss the values of the parameters needed to calculate
capital costs.

In general, we consider a hypothetical firm that is trying to decide

whether or not to buy a particular asset. This asset may be any one of
the 38 assets listed in left-hand column of Table 1. These definitions

are combinations of more diverse asset types, but they still provide
considerable disaggregation.

We treat each of these assets as

individually homogeneous, in the sense that each has a single tax
treatment and economic depreciation rate (ô). The first 20 assets are
types of equipment, the next 15 are types of structures, and the last
two are inventories and land.6 Our values for 5 are shown in column 1 of

Table 1.

These rates of depreciation were estimated by Hulten and

Wykoff (1981), and their availablity provides the major reason for using

this particular set of asset definitions.1 The estimated depreciation

rates range from a low of .015 for housing to a high of .333 for
automobiles. Inventories and land do not depreciate (nor are they given
depreciation allowances under any tax regime).

Upon purchasing the asset, our hypothetical firm receives an
investment tax credit at rate k. Discussion of these values is deferred

6 The firm may also earn income on intangible assets such as knowledge
acquired through research, or goodwill acquired through advertising.

Because we do not have adequate estimates for the stock of these
assets in each industry, they are excluded from this study.

For assets 27 through 31, the depreciation rates come from Jorgenson
and Sullivan (1981). They use the Hulten-Wykoff methodology to obtain
estimates for these additional assets. The rate for housing is an
unpublished estimate of Hulten and Wykoff.

to the section for each tax regime, but we always assume that the firm
has enough tax liability to make use of the credit.

Out of the return to the asset, the firm must pay a wealth tax (at

rate w) on the value of the asset each year. These state and local
property tax rates vary among thousands of jurisdictions, so we estimate

average rates based on data from the Advisory

Commission on

Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR), as found in Harriss (1974). These

data provide property taxes paid in 1972 on business realty (land and

structures), business personalty (equipment and inventories), public

utility structures, and household realty (rental and owner-occupied

housing). We scale each of these tax amounts upward to 1977, using
Commerce Department data on total property taxes in 1977 and 1972; we
then divide each 1977 estimate by the corresponding 1977 capital stocks

as described below.

The resulting rates, applied either to the

corporate or noncorporate sector, are

.00768 for equipment and

inventories, .01126 for business land and structures, .01550 for public
utilities, and .01837 for household realty (land and structures).

On its return net of property taxes, the corporation is taxed at the
statutory rate u. We use .46 for the federal statutory rate on marginal

corporate income, since this top bracket rate applies to the largest

firms with essentially all of the corporate capital stock.

The

weighted-average of the statest top-bracket rates is .0655, including
zeros for states without corporate taxes and using personal income to

weight the fifty states.

We

use

.365 for this parameter, obtained as the weighted average of marginal
statutory tax rates on entrepreneurial income of 25,000 individual tax

returns in the TAXSIM data file of the National Bureau of Economic
Research (NBER).

The after-tax return to this hypothetical firm is expected to grow in
nominal terms at the rate of inflation (it),

generally

set at 7 percent.

For most tax -schemes, the firm also receives future depreciation
allowances that are specified in nominal amounts for a fixed number of
years. We calculate the present value of these depreciation allowances
(z), and the present value of the nominal after-tax returns, using the
nominal after-tax discount rate for the firm. These discount rates are

discussed in the Appendix, but they are derived such that the real
after-tax return to the average investor is a parameter s, set to 5
percent.

In considering this investment, our hypothetical firm compares the

acquisition cost (net of investment tax credits) to the present
discounted value of after-tax returns and tax savings from depreciation
allowances. In equilibrium, the net outlay would just equal the present

value of net returns from the marginal investment. We then use this
equality to solve for the gross-of-tax return that the asset must earn
in order to cover taxes and still yield the minimum required after-tax

return. The required pre-tax return net of depreciation (p) is the
cost-of-capital for that asset.

Because firms can make certain choices about depreciation lifetimes

and schedules, actual capital costs may be affected by those choices.

—11—

When accelerated depreciation was first introduced, for example, Vasquez

(1974) found that firms were slow to adopt the more advantageous
schedules. Because there is no procedure to predict actual choices for

untried tax schemes, however, we compare all schemes under the
assumption that firms make choices that minimize their taxes.

This

approach has the further advantage that it allows us to calculate
comparable capital costs based only on tax provisions rather than on

actual practices. We extend this assumption to firms' choices with
respect to inventory accounting. Under all tax regimes we assume that

firms minimize their taxes by using only last-in-first-out (LIFO)
inventory accounting. This method allows the firm to avoid taxes on
purely nominal accounting profits, but it does not avoid taxes on real
profits associated with investing in inventories.8

Our parameter s, the real return after personal taxes, is defined as

a weighted-average of returns to different individuals who finance the

marginal investment. In the corporate sector, the asset's purchase is

financed by new share issues, retained earnings, and debt, in the
proportions c5, cre, and cd respectively. King and Fullerton (1984)

provide information on these three proportions for each of three
different corporate industry groups.

When we weight by corporate

capital stock, we obtain overall proportions of .0490 for new shares,
.6143 for retained earnings, and .3367 for debt.

An equity-financed investment in inventories must yield a return in
the form of real corporate profits that is at least as high as the
return that could have been earned on an alternative investment.
These real corporate profits are taxed at the .495 corporate rate.

-12-

Investments financed by new shares earn a return which is paid out in

dividends and taxed at rate 't

.

The TAXSIM data file of the NBER

provides a tax rate of .475 for marginal dividend income, including
state taxes and averaged over 25,000 households.

King and Fullerton

(1984) provide additional tax rates and weights for dividends received

by tax-exempt institutions and insurance companies. When marginal tax
rates for these three categories are weighted together, we obtain .356

.

The NBERts TAXSIM file is again used to

find the weighted-average statutory rate on marginal capital gains of
households, incorporating the 60 percent exclusion on long-term capital
gains.

This 28 percent rate is further reduced to account for the

deferral advantage and the increase of basis at death. Following King

and Fullerton (1984), the final 7 percent rate for households is
averaged with zero for tax-exempt institutions and .14 for insurance
companies to obtain .058 for t

The TAXSIM file places the average

householdts marginal rate at .325, including state taxes, but King and
Fullerton (1984) reduce this rate to .284 to account for interest that

is paid to banks and received by households in the form of tax-free
banking services.

Insurance companies' tax rates increase with

inflation because of the complex tienge Formula, but the net effect is

summarized in the estimate (.149 + 3.88ir), where ii is the rate of

-13-

inflation.8 When households, tax-exempts, and insurance companies are

weighted together, the overall value for Td comes to (.196 + .595'n).

This rate changes as we vary n, but td is .238 in the standard case
where inflation is seven percent.

Of marginal investments in the noncorporate sector, a fraction d is

financed by debt, and n is financed by equity of the entrepreneur.
Little evidence

is

available on the complicated financing of

noncorporate business in the U.S., but our rough estimates suggest that

it is not dissimilar in aggregate to the financing of corporate
business, that is, one-third debt.1°

Finally, for owner-occupied housing, we need a fraction hd for debt
and he for equity. New homes are financed with a very large proportion
of debt, but we are considering a permanent change in the steady state

allocation of capital. The loan to value ratio typically falls as the

house ages, and we want total mortgage debt as a fraction of total
market value. Unpublished estimates from the Census Bureau suggest that

this ratio is again very close to one-third.1 As a consequence, we use
the same fraction for debt financing in all three sectors.

The estimate of the effective tax rate on life insurance companies
summarizes a complex set of rules. For a description of this aspect
of the tax code and discussion of modeling choices, see King and
Revisions in the tax treatment of insurance
Fullerton (1984).

companies are under discussion in Congress at the time of this
writing, but we have not included any new proposals in this paper.

10 The ratio of noncorporate interest payments to an estimate of the
share of noncorporate income attributable to capital, from the July
1982 Survey of Current Business, is almost identical to the ratio of
corporate interest payments to corporate income from capital.
We are grateful to Peter Fronczek for providing these numbers.

The weighted-average marginal tax rate for these homeowners is

estimated at .26 by the TAXSIM model of NBER. Data in Fullerton and
Gordon (1983) suggest that 44.8 percent of property taxes are deducted,

the

The required pre-tax returns from each tax scheme are important
parameters in that they summarize the cumulative impact of personal
taxes, property taxes, and corporate taxes. Because they are numbers
like .06 or .08, however, they are sometimes difficult to interpret by
themselves. The parameter s represents the real return after all taxes,

so the difference (p-s) is due solely to taxes.

This difference,

expressed as a fraction of the pre-tax return, is a measure of the
ttmarginal effective total tax rate" in the terminology of Fullerton
(1984). These numbers are presented in the tables below because they

are comparable to tax-inclusive ad valorem tax rates such as the 46
percent statutory corporate rate.

They are reduced relative to the

corporate rate because of investment tax credits and accelerated
depreciation allowances, but they are raised relative to the corporate
rate because of property taxes and personal taxes.

The rest of this section describes relevant aspects of (A.) the tax
law in the United States as it stood in 1980, (B.) the ultimate version

of the 1981 tax law (ERTA), if phased reductions had been allowed to
continue through 1986, (C.) current tax law as it stands after TEFRA,
the 1982 tax law, (D.) an alternative reform suggested by Auerbach and
Jorgenson (1980), (E.) the integration of corporate and personal income

taxes, and (F.) the elimination of the corporate income tax. For each

-15-

tax regime, we present marginal effective total tax rates for each asset
and for each industry.

A. Tax Law as of 1980

The investment tax credit was introduced in 1962, repealed in 1969,
reintroduced in 1971, and raised in 1975. As of 1980, the credit stood

at a ten percent rate for all public utility structures and for
equipment with tax lifetimes of at least seven years; two-thirds of that

for equipment with lifetimes of at least five years; and one-third for

equipment with lifetimes of at least three years. Since we treat each
of the assets in Table 1 as individually homogeneous, column 2 assigns a

ten percent credit to all public utility structures (assets 27-31) and

to any type of equipment that has a tax lifetime of at least seven
years. Tractors (asset 4) and trucks (asset 14) have five year lives
and 6.67 percent credits, while autos (asset 15) have a three year life
and 3.33 percent credit.

Our lifetimes for each asset are shown in column 3.

The 1962

Guideline lifetimes applied to many diverse assets, and these were
aggregated by Jorgenson and Sullivan (1981) to the 35 depreciable asset
types shown here. The Asset Depreciation Range (ADR) System, introduced

in 1971 and still effective in 1980, allowed firms to use 80 to 120
percent of these Guideline lifetimes for equipment and public utility
structures.

Because firms minimize their taxes by assumption, they

would use the shortest available lifetimes unless that choice had the

effect of raising taxes by lowering the investment tax credit.
reduce the Guideline lifetime estimates accordingly.

We

would choose 5 years if not for the credit, but they choose 7 years (as
shown in column 3 of Table 1) in order to receive the 10 percent credit
and minimize taxes.12

The 1980 tax scheme, like most others, has separate depreciation
rules for different kinds of assets. Double declining balance (DDB) and
surn-of-the-years'-digits (SYD) can be used for equipment, public utility
property,
structures.

single-purpose agricultural structures,

and residential

If we define L as the asset's lifetime for tax purposes,

then DDB allows depreciation equal to 2/L of the remaining basis each
year.

Because of the half-year convention, however, all assets are

assumed to have been purchased on July 1. They receive half of the DDB
amount, (i/L), in the year of purchase and 2/L of the remaining basis,

(l-l/L), in the first full year of ownership. At this point, as shown

in Fullerton and Henderson (1983), the firm would minimize taxes by
switching to SYD. If there are 3.5 years left (as for a 5 year asset),
the firm takes the basis remaining at the time of the switch and divides
it over the remaining years according to the fractions obtained by using
a denominator of 8.0 and numerators of 3.5, 2.5, 1.5, and 0.5.

For other structures, firms could use 150 percent of declining
balance (l.5/L of remaining basis each year), with an optimal switch to

straight-line after one-third of the life of the asset. The firm must
begin straight-line depreciation at the start of a tax year, however,
and we assume that they make this choice to take the earliest allowable

deductions (to minimize taxes). We also assume that the firm buys only
new assets and holds them forever, so that we can abstract from problems
with recapture taxes or scrap values.

These depreciation allowances, specified by law over a finite number
of years for each asset, are discounted by the firm's nominal after-tax

rate of return because allowances are based on historical cost. The

present value of allowances per dollar of original basis is the
parameter z in equation (A2) of the appendix. Since the entire purchase
price was depreciable in 1980, we use 1.0 for the parameter a.'3

We have now specified enough information to calculate effective tax
rates under 1980 law for each asset, and rates for the corporate sector

are shown in column 1 of Table 2. Note that the first twenty assets,
types of equipment, have rates that vary from a subsidy of 27 percent

(for computers) to a tax of 22 percent (for ships and boats). Public
utility structures (assets 27-31) also receive investment tax credits,
but they have longer depreciation lifetimes and tax rates that are all

about 33 percent.

Other structures receive no credits, longer

lifetimes, and depreciation at only 150 percent of declining balance, so

in that paper indicate that while the depreciation allowances are
discrete amounts for each year, we discount them continuously over
the course of the year. This procedure recognizes the fact that the
basis declines annually, not continuously, and that deductions
earlier in the year are worth more than those at the end of the year.

their tax rates vary from 44 to 56 percent.

With inflation, these

allowances are sometimes less than economic depreciation at replacement

cost. Business land and inventories, which actually receive economic
allowances since they do not depreciate, have

total effective tax rates

of 40 and 36 percent, respectively. These rates include property taxes

that differ by asset and personal taxes that do not differ by asset.

The wide disparities, from -27 to +56 percent across all assets,
indicate the potential for significant misallocation of capital.

B. The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981

While many provisions of the 1981 Tax Act were to phase-in over
several years, the investment tax credit changed immediately to a six
percent rate for automobiles and ten percent for all other equipment and

public utility property. These credit rates are shown in column 4 of
Table 1.

Because of our assumption of no carryover problems, both sets

of credit rates reflect statutory credits and do not reflect any
increase in availability of the credit through the 1981 law's extended
carryover and leasing provisions.

Column 5 displays lifetimes of each asset under the Accelerated Cost

Recovery System (ACRS), assuming again that each asset is homogeneous.
The law assigns a three year life to autos, light trucks, R&D equipment,

certain racehorses, and personal property with an ADR midpoint of four

years or less. Our level of aggregation shows autos with a three year
life, but none of the other assets has an (average) ADR midpoint of four

years or less.

Thus, all other equipment gets a five year life.

Similarly, for public utility structures, we assigned a ten year life to

any asset category with an ADR midpoint between 18 and 25 years, as
provided in the law. All other structures have a 15 year life, except
mining, shafts, and wells which we reduced from a 6.8 to a 5 year life.

Although these shorter lives were effective immediately, depreciation

of new equipment was scheduled to accelerate from 150 percent of
declining balance to 175 percent of declining balance during a five year

phase-in period. After 1985, new equipment was again to be depreciated
by double declining balance, again with an optimal switch to sum-of-the-

-20-

year's-digits.'5 We evaluate only this final set of rules, originally
scheduled to begin in 1986. All structures immediately received a 175
percent declining balance rate, replacing both the 150 percent rate for

nonresidential property and the 200 percent rate for new residential
property. All structures switch at the optimal time from 175 percent
declining balance to straight-line, after three-sevenths of the life of
the asset.16

The 1981 law also provides phased reductions of personal marginal tax

rates. While the top marginal rate fell from 70 percent to 50 percent
immediately, all other rates are reduced by 23 percent over three years.

After 1985, personal rate brackets are scheduled to be indexed for
inflation. We wish to compare 1980 with the ultimate (1986) version of

ERTA, but we cannot simply reduce personal rates by 23 percent.
Inflation after 1980 will erode at least some of these rate cuts by the

time indexing starts in 1985. In fact, King and Fullerton (1984) find

15 An interesting difference, however, is that depreciation of the last

half year is moved up. The five year asset in the earlier example
receives DDB for 1.5 years as before, but SYD over only 3 remaining
years instead of 3.5. Thus, even where the asset's lifetime was not
shortened (as for assets 5 and 14), the present value of allowances
(z) is still higher under 1981 law.

16 The optimal switch point for 175 percent of declining balance is
calculated as (1.75 - 1.0)/1.75 as shown in Fullerton and Henderson
(1983). Rather than specify allowable schedules and let the firm

choose, however, the 1981 and 1982 laws provide tables with
depreciation amounts for each year. These amounts are calculated for
the tables by using the rules described in the text, assuming that
firms want the earliest possible deductions. We thus effectively use
the tables for the new laws, and we use comparable tax-minimizing

choices for the old law. The new law is less flexible, however,
because it mandates the earliest possible deductions. If the firm
did not expect a steady stream of positive taxable profits, as is
assumed in this paper, it might prefer to delay some deductions by
using a longer life or by making an early switch to straight-line.

over those six years to completely negate the 23 percent cut.

reason, we ignore personal tax changes specified

abstract from changes related to tax-free "all-savers' certificates" for

individuals, charitable deductions for nonitemizers, reductions in the
marriage penalty for two-earner families, and other provisions that do
not pertain primarily to business income from real capital assets.

Effective tax rates under ERTA are shown for each asset in column 2

of Table 2.

Rates for equipment are all negative, while rates for

structures range up to 45 percent. Since land and inventories receive
no credits or deductions anyway, their effective tax rates are unchanged
from 1980.

Because the relatively high 1980 rates for these assets

remain high while the relatively low 1980 rates for equipment are
reduced, it appears that the potential for capital misallocations would
be worse under ERTA.

Previous estimates of the marginal effective corporate tax rate under

ERTA have consistently been negative for all types of equipment. The

implication is that credits and accelerated depreciation deductions
outweigh the corporate tax and provide a net subsidy on income from
marginal investments in these assets. Yet Table 2 indicates that the
marginal effective total tax rates are negative. The implication here

is that the subsidy at the corporate level is so large that it
completely offsets property taxes and personal taxes, even though
personal taxes apply to nominal income.17

This marginal subsidy can be received by any corporation with
sufficient taxable profits against which to take the credits and

-22-

Since depreciation schedules were to be the same in 1986 as they were

in 1980, we can also see how sensitive tax rates are to lifetimes and
credits. When only the lifetime for computers (asset 11) changes from 7
to 5 years, the total effective tax rate changes from a -27 percent to a

-233 percent. When only the credit for autos (asset 15) changes from
.033 to .06, its effective tax rate changes from a positive 11 percent
to a negative 104 percent.'8

The corresponding industry tax rates are shown in column 2 of Table
3.

The fact that all these rates exceed zero reflects weights on

structures, inventories and land in all industries.

These averaged

rates still reflect more variance than they did in 1980.

C. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982

The scheduled increase for depreciation of equipment was never
allowed to take place, since TEFRA effectively repealed the transition
to double-declining balance. It retained the investment tax credits and

the shorter lives of ACRS, but it left equipment with 150 percent of
declining balance and an optimal switch to straight-line.

Structures

had no transition in the 1981 law, so they are left at 175 percent of

declining balance with a switch to straight-line. These specifications

provide enough information to calculate z, the present value of
allowances per dollar of basis. Also, however, TEFRA reduced the basis

for depreciation by half of the investment tax credit.

As a

consequence, we set the depreciable proportion parameter (a) to .95 for

equipment and public utility property with a ten percent credit and to
.97 for autos with a six percent credit.

Again we abstract from other changes in TEFRA that are not related to

the taxation of income from real business assets, including newly
introduced excise taxes, medical and casualty loss deductions, and
individual minimum tax provisions. Since our hypothetical firm always
has sufficient tax liability to use all of its credits and deductions,
it is unaffected by TEFRA's restrictions of safe-harbor leasing.

The resulting tax rates for equipment are mostly negative, as shown

in column 3 of Table 2.

Although they use the ACRS lifetimes of the

1981 law, their overall levels are closer to 1980 law.

In fact, for

many of the assets (e.g., tractors, some types of machinery, computers,

trucks, aircraft, and electric utility property), 1982 tax rates are
higher than 1980 rates (for the same expected rate of inflation). For
these assets, the tax-raising effect of the basis adjustment outweighs

the tax-reducing effect of shortened tax lives. The tendency for tax
rates to be higher under 1962 law is stronger when the comparison is
made under the assumption of low inflation rates in both periods. When
tax rates are computed under the assumption of four percent inflation,

for example, more types of equipment show higher tax rates under 1982
law than under 1980 law. Real depreciatibn allowances (z) are greater

-24-

at low inflation rates, so the tax-increasing basis adjustment is more
important at low inflation rates.

Taxation of structures is the same under the 1982 law as under the
1981 law. Column 3 of Table 3 shows tax rates by industry, reflecting
their asset compositions.

D. The Auerbach-Jorgenson Proposal

Next, our study evaluates other investment incentive plans that were

not adopted. The Auerbach-Jorgenson (1980) first year capital recovery
plan gives the firm one depreciation deduction at the time the asset is
purchased, equal to the expected present value of economic depreciation

at replacement cost. Since future economic depreciation is discounted
at a constant real after-tax discount rate, this proposal effectively
indexes depreciation allowances for inflation.

It treats all assets

symmetrically in the sense that it provides a high first year deduction

for equipment with a high 6, a low deduction for structures with a low
6, and no deduction for land and inventories which do not depreciate.

If a.) there is no investment tax credit, b.) Hulten-Wykoff
depreciation rates are used to determine economic depreciation, and c.)

the firm's real discount rate is used to calculate the first year
recovery, then estimates of the marginal effective corporate tax rate
are equal to the statutory 49.5 percent rate for all assets.

If this

depreciation is well measured, then this plan removes all inter-asset

distortions in the corporate sector.9 Similar allowances in the

Column 4 of Table 2 shows the marginal effective total tax rate for
each asset under this plan. Although corporate taxes and personal taxes
on these assets are uniform, property taxes are imposed at a .8 percent

rate on all kinds of equipment, a 1.1 percent rate on nonresidential

structures, and a 1.55 percent rate on public utility property.
Marginal effective total tax rates vary little, but they are ordered

across these assets according to these property tax rates. Industry
effective tax rates in column 4 of Table 3 vary even less.

E. Integration of Corporate and Personal Taxes.
Because of the potential for distortions when extra taxes are imposed

on the corporate sector, many have suggested integrating the corporate

is taxed only at the personal level. Here, we evaluate only a full form

of integration, and we compare it to current 1982 tax law.

Further

discussion of many such plans and their effects is provided by ticLure
(1979).

Our specification of this reform involves retaining investment tax

credits and depreciation allowances, just as these features exist in
1982 for the noncorporate sector. We then trace all taxable corporate
income through to be taxed only at the level of the individuals who own
the corporations.

Intersectoral distortions

remain to the extent that these personal tax rates differ from the
personal rate of entrepreneurs, and interasset distortions may remain to

the extent that credits and depreciation allowances have differential
impacts on assets.
-

Column 5 of Table 2 shows the marginal effective total tax rates on
assets in the corporate sector with integration. These rates are very
similar to those of the noncorporate sector in 1982. Rates on equipment

are reduced from 1982 corporate numbers which vary around zero to
numbers which are all negative. Thus, with integration, personal taxes

and property taxes are effectively offset by credits and accelerated

depreciation deductions for these assets.

Rates on structures are

reduced from numbers around 38 percent to numbers around 30 percent.

Because industries use these assets in different proportions,
industry tax rates still vary in column 5 of Table 3.

Some inter-

industry distortions thus remain, in contrast to previous models where

-27-

all industry distortions are based on extra corporate taxes and
differential degrees of incorporation. Intertemporal distortions remain
as well.

F. Elimination of the Corporate Income Tax

The last set of calculations does not represent a serious or even
necessarily desirable policy proposal. Instead, we are merely trying to

help evaluate the overall impact of the corporate tax in any of the
first four regimes described above.

Since personal taxes and property

taxes are constant across all of those simulations, any of the first
four sets of tax rates (1980, 1981, 1982, AJ) can be compared to those
from a world with just the personal and property taxes.

Elimination of the corporate tax, by this definition, involves
concomitant elimination of the corporationst investment tax credits (k),

depreciation deductions

(z),

and interest deductions.

The IRS

undertakes no interactions with corporations, but it continues to
collect personal taxes as before on all nominal interest receipts,
dividends, capital gains, and noncorporate income. In equations of the
appendix, these specifications merely imply that k =

u

=

z = 0.

Column 6 •of Table 2 exhibits fairly high effective tax rates,
differing only to the extent that property taxes differ by asset.

Tax

rates for equipment are higher than those for any other tax plan except

the Auerbach-Jorgenson plan.21 These findings are consistent with

investments at the 49.5 percent statutory rate of the corporation, it

-28-

previous findings that the corporate tax system amounts to a net subsidy

for equipment. Other assets, however, receive no investment tax credits

and less accelerated depreciation.

Because inflation may reduce the

real values of allowances to less than economic depreciation, effective
total tax rates on structures under the 1980 law and 1982 law are about

50 and 38 percent, respectively. Under either law, taxes on land and
inventories are 40 and 36 percent. The elimination of the corporate tax

more than offsets the elimination of nominal interest deductions in
these cases, because these rates fall to 33 percent for structures, 33
percent for land, and 30 percent for inventories.

When weighted by the use of assets in each indutry, marginal
effective total tax rates under repeal are shown in column 6 of Table 3
for each of our 18 industries.

III. The Noncorporate Sector and Housing

The noncorporate entrepreneur is taxed by rules similar to those for

the corporation but has a .365 personal tax rate rather than the .495
corporate rate. Effective tax rates therefore vary in a similar manner

across the 38 assets, but the overall level is different.

For this

reason, we do not provide noncorporate rates on all assets under each
scheme.

Instead, table 4 provides some summary statistics on the

corporate tax, on the other hand, would allow no investment tax
credits, no interest deductions, and no allowances for depreciation
—
even economic depreciation. The estimated effective tax rates

reflect the fact that the personal tax applies to nominal interest
receipts, since they are designed to include all taxes as a fraction
of real income from the asset.

overall levels of tax for the twenty kinds of equipment averaged
together, the nine types of business structures averaged together, and

the five public utility structures averaged together, as well as for
land and inventories.

Under the 1980 law, shown in column 1, we obtain the surprising
result that the 35.8 percent overall tax rate in the noncorporate sector

exceeds the 34.5 percent rate in the corporate sector. A noncorporate
firm would not reduce its taxes by incorporating, however, because on
any one activity, the corporate rate exceeds the noncorporate rate.

In

the corporate and noncorporate sectors, respectively, equipment is taxed

at rates of +5 and -2 percent, structures are taxed at iates of 50 and

39 percent, while land is taxed at rates of 40 and 36 percent. The
explanation of the overall tax rates is that noncorporate firms use much
more of the highly taxed structures and land.

Still, the difference between the two sectors is not great. The fact
that the corporate statutory rate exceeds the entrepeneur's rate implies

higher taxes on some assets but higher interest deductions and subsidies

on other assets. Additional personal taxes on corporate income are very
small. The 5.8 percent capital gains rate applies to the large share of

finance through retained earnings, and the 35.6 percent dividends rate
applies only to the tiny share of financing through new issues.

The overall rate in the noncorporate sector includes 39 and 40
percent effective tax rates, respectively, on structures and land in
rental housing. By contrast, the effective tax on structures or land in

owner-occupied housing is only 18.6 percent. This rate represents only

state and local property taxes, reduced to the degree that they are

-30-

deducted from personal taxes. The rate is further reduced to the degree

that mortgage interest is deducted at a rate greater than the rate at
which interest receipts are taxed.

When averaged over the entire economy, the marginal effective total
tax rate in 1980 was 28.8 percent, reflecting an after-tax return of .05

and a pre-tax return of .070.

Though we have not yet measured

misallocations associated with variations of this cum-tax cost-ofcapital across assets and sectors, the weighted standard deviation of
.017 indicates potential for excess burden.

The second and third columns of Table 4 indicate that the Economic

Recovery Tax Act would have reduced corporate taxes dramatically but
that the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act removed about half of

that tax cut.

Equipment in either sector would have been heavily

subsidized under ERTA but is now only slightly subsidized. The tax cuts
for public utility structures were almost completely removed, while the

tax cuts for structures were not touched by TEFRA. In contrast, neither

law provided any changes for taxes on inventories, land, or owneroccupied housing.

Because the largest tax cuts in ERTA applied to equipment, the assets
with the lowest existing tax rates, the standard deviation among capital

costs would have increased from .017 to .020 at the same time that the
average capital cost would have fallen from .070 to .066. TEFRA removed
tax cuts for equipment in particular, so the standard deviation returns
to .017 while the overall pre-tax returns climbs half-way back, to .068.

The Auerbach-Jorgenson plan, in column 4, would leave inventories and

-31-

land unchanged, raise slightly the 1982 tax on structures and raise

significantly the 1982 rate on equipment.

There remain interasset

differences due to the property tax, and intersectoral differences due

to the unintegrated corporate tax system and the exclusion of imputed
net rents. Relative to 1982, effective tax rates rise by 9 percentage
points in the corporate sector, 4 points in the noncorporate sector, and

4 points overall. The cost-of-capital rises to .072, but its weighted
standard deviation falls to .014.

Integration of corporate and personal taxes, the way we have defined

it, does not remove interasset distortions attributable to investment

tax credits and differential allowances.

It does remdve almost all

differences between the corporate and noncorporate sectors, however.

These differences turn out to be important, because the standard
deviation of capital costs falls to .009. Each individual asset would

be taxed at the same rate in either of the two sectors, but the
noncorporate sector includes highly taxed rental housing and therefore
averages to a higher overall tax rate.22

Asset tax differences in the corporate sector would be greatly
reduced by repeal of the corporate tax, as shown in column 6 of table 4.
Asset differences remain in the noncorporate sector, as do intersectoral

differences. Elimination of corporate subsidies raises the corporate

22 Tax rates for noncorporate business and housing are slightly changed
from column 3 to column 5, even though "integration't does not affect
tax rules applicable to those sectors. We use the ceteris paribus
assumption that the weighted-average after-tax return to capital is
constant across tax schemes, however. The higher personal •taxation
of corporate income necessitates a higher interest rate to maintain

that fixed after-tax return, and the higher market interest rate
affects discounting in the noncorporate and housing sectors.

-32-

rate from 30 percent in 1982 to 32.1 percent.23 It raises the overall

tax rate to 30.5 percent, capital costs to .072, and the standard
deviation to .019.

IV. Sensitivity Analysis

A. Inflation

The sensitivity of tax rates to inflation is among the most
significant findings of our study.

Under 1982 law we find that

inflation has far from uniform impact on the taxation of different
assets: it raises some tax rates and lowers others.

Tijese differing

impacts result in interasset distortions that become quite sizeable at

some levels of inflation.

Specifically, we find that double-digit

inflation is associated with sharply higher dispersion in the cost-of-

capital than is inflation in the zero to five percent range. Although
we cannot measure the associated efficiency losses without performing

general equilibrium simulations, these results are indicative of
potential misallocations of captial at high rates of inflation.21'

23 Corporations may not actually experience this subsidy because the
size of their earnings puts a limit on use of deductions and credits.
The assymetric treatment of taxes and subsidies is accentuated when

the tax law allows marginal subsidies as is currently true for
equipment.

21' As we discuss below, there is also some uncertainty about the
robustness of these results on dispersion when we vary modeling
assumptions. The pattern that some tax rates rise with inflation and
others fall seems to be general, however. Finally, although we do
not present inflation sensitivity results for 1980 law in this paper,
they are similar to those for 1982 law (under a given set of modeling
assumptions).

-33-

There are four influences of inflation that our model captures.
First, even though tax lives are sharply reduced under the accelerated
cost recovery system, the basis for depreciation is still original cost
rather than replacement cost.

As a consequence, with higher rates of

inflation, the present discounted value of depreciation allowances
falls, and the cost-of-capital rises.

Second, equity holders are taxed on nominal rather than real capital

gains, and debt holders are taxed on nominal rather than real interest

receipts. A constant rate of tax on nominal income thus results in a
rising real burden as inflation increases. The magnitude of this effect

depends on the hypothesized increase in taxable income for each
additional point of inflation. As described in the Technical Appendix,

our model assumes that the real after-tax rate of return is constant,

when we look at different rates of inflation.

As a result, taxable

income rises by more than point for point with inflation.

A third reason that the cost-of-capital rises with inflation lies in

the taxation of insurance companies. The ?Ienge Formula determines the

deductibility of reserves in such a way that inflation raises the
insurance company's rate of tax as well as its taxable income (see King
and Fullerton, 1984, Chapter 6). After accounting for the proportion of

debt that is held by insurance companies, we find that each point of
inflation adds about 0.6 points to td the tax rate on interest income.

Offsetting the first three influences of inflation is
deductibility of nominal interest payments.

td = .196 + .595ir.

As we vary inflation from zero to fifteen percent in

our sensitivity analysis, the tax rate for interest recipients rises
from .196 to .285, which indicates a subsidy per dollar of interest (u-

td) that diminishes with inflation. Thus, as inflation increases the
nominal interest which receives the subsidy (u_rd), it also reduces the
rate of subsidy.

Because the marginal tax rate of noncorporate entrepreneurs is .365,

there is also a subsidy on the use of debt in that sector. In our third

sector for homeowners, marginal tax rates average 26 percent.

Each

dollar of interest is thus subsidized at rates of inflation below 10.8

percent (where td reaches .26) and taxed at rates of Jnflation above
10.8 percent.

The list of influences of inflation explicitly excludes any bracket
creep for individuals. Since we look at the long-run impact of current
law, we assume the indexing provisions currently scheduled to begin in

1985. In the absence of this measure, inflation would have a greater

tendency to push tax rates upward. We also exclude FIFO inventory
accounting when we look at only the tax-minimizing firm. If FIFO were
required in some way, inflation would increase taxes for this reason as
well.

We use two figures to display the net effects of the four included
influences of inflation under 1982 law.

Figure 1 plots selected tax

rates as a function of inflation, and figure 2 plots the weighted
standard deviation of capital costs across all assets and sectors as a

function of inflation. One striking fact in figure 1 is the relative
constancy of aggregated marginal tax rates on capital.

-35-

tax rate is .282 at zero inflation, reaches a low of .262 at about ten
percent inflation, then rises back to .270 at 15 percent inflation. The

corporate rate is even more constant, staying between 29.5 and 30.5
percent!

This remarkable stability of mean tax rates,

however, masks

underlying differences in the effect of inflation on the taxation of

various individual assets.

Figure 1 provides a glimpse at this

diversity, since it includes a plot of the tax rates in the corporate
sector for the aggregate of the twenty types of equipment, for the nine

types of structures, and for inventories. The effective tax rate on
equipment rises monotonically from -.359 at zero inflaton to +.312 at
15 percent inflation.

In the cost of equipment, then, the erosion of

depreciation allowances is more important than the net addition to
nominal interest deductions. Inflation also reduces the real value of

depreciation on structures and raises the effective tax rate on that
asset.

Because of the relatively long tax lives for structures,

however, a given inflation-induced increase in the discount rate has
less impact on the present value of allowances than it does in the case

of equipment. For assets that do not depreciate, such as inventories in
figure 1, inflation adds to the nominal interest which is deducted at a

rate greater than the rate at which it is subsequently taxed. This
subsidizing effect of further inflation eventually offsets the tax on
this asset.

Finally, figure 1 indicates that the tax rate on owner-

occupied housing is a U-shaped function of inflation. Initial inflation

increases the nominal interest subsidy since Th is greater than td but
subsequent inflation raises the latter rate for interest receipts above
the former rate for interest deductions. Inflation then adds to the net

-36-

tax in housing. Because this sector comprises a third of the total
capital stock, the rate for the economy also exhibits a slight U-shaped
pattern.

Figure 2 summarizes information about the effect of inflation on the

spread in the cost-of-capital among assets and sectors. The standard

deviation of p is about 1.5 percentage points when inflation is 5
percent and under. At 10 percent inflation it is one-fourth greater,
and at 15 percent it is fully twice as great. In section D below, we
explore the sensitivity of these results to specifications of the model.

To summarize, high inflation seems to add more to interasset and
intersectoral distortions than it adds to intertemporal distortions via

overall capital costs. Because of offsetting effects from the taxation
of interest and historical cost depreciation, a rise in inflation does
not affect the overall tax rates on capital.

A rise in inflation does,

on the other hand, discourage investment in depreciable assets, thereby
affecting efficiency in the use of capital.

B. Debt Finance
As the previous section on inflation points out, investments financed

by debt are subsidized because firms that deduct interest payments are

in a higher marginal tax bracket than the individuals who include
interest receipts. Because the debt-to-capital ratio is about one-third

in each of our three sectors, this subsidy can have a major impact on

the cost of capital. This hypothesis is confirmed in our analysis of

the 1982 law assuming all equity finance. These results employ the
standard seven percent inflation rate and are reported in column 2 of

-37-

table 5. Without debt, the overall tax rate in the economy would rise

from 26 to 38 percent. The largest increase, from 30 to 64 percent,

would occur in the corporate sector for two reasons.

First, the

differential between the statutory corporate rate and the personal tax

rate on interest is a large 26 percentage points.

Second, in the

absence of debt, a larger fraction of the corporate capital stock would

be taxed at the high rate for dividends. Under the assumption of no

debt finance, the combination of the investment tax credit and
depreciation allowances for equipment (in both the corporate and
noncorporate sectors) would no longer be sufficient to offset other
features of the income tax system, and these assets woul face positive
rates of tax.

Column 3 of table 5 presents, for contrast, marginal tax rates under

the assumption of 100 percent debt finance at the margin. We find that
the subsidies to investment in the corporate sector and in noncorporate
equipment are sizeable, and that investment in other depreciable assets
in the noncorporate sector faces very low rates of taxation.

C. Property Taxation

In column 4 of table 5 we show estimates of current law tax rates in

the absence of the property tax. These may be useful for two purposes.

First, the results highlight the relatively large importance of the
property tax in measuring the cost-of-capital. This point is especially

striking in light of the fact that many published measures of marginal

tax rates on capital do not include taxes on wealth.

Second, the

estimates provide an alternative assessment of the tax system, under the

view that property taxes are exactly offset at the margin by additional

local public services.

If taxpayers are sufficiently mobile and have

sufficient choice among jurisdictions, then local property taxes are
merely voluntary payments for local services and thus do not distort the

marginal investment decision. We apply this Tiebout hypothesis to both
residential and nonresidential capital.

For homeowners, whose implicit rents and capital gains go untaxed,
the property tax is the only source of taxation. Without the property
tax, the effective tax rate on owner-occupied housing drops from +18.6
percent to -2.1 percent. The remaining subsidy is due to the fact that

mortgage payments are deducted by owner-occupants at a rate slightly
higher than the rate at which they are included by holdrs of mortgage
debt.

Nonresidential property taxes were estimated to be a lower fraction

of the value of capital than were residential property taxes: rates

ranged from 0.77 percent for equipment to 1.55 percent on public
utilities, as opposed to 1.84 percent for housing.

As a result,

elimination of the property tax has a somewhat smaller effect in nonhousing sectors. Still, the impact is large enough to produce a drop in
the overall tax rate in the economy from 26 to 9 percent.

In addition,

without differential property tax rates, the standard deviation in the
cost-of-capital would fall from 0.17 to .015.

D. Assumptions about Arbitrage

Our standard model assumes that arbitrage takes place at the firm
level: firms in all sectors compare the return to debt with the return

on real capital, and they use the after-tax interest rate as the

-39-

required after-tax return on all investments. The rate of return, net
of personal taxes, averages .05 in the economy, but differences in the

taxation of equity capital across the three sectors precludes the
possibility of the same return, net of personal taxes, to all forms of
investment. As described in the Appendix, an alternative model assumes
arbitrage at the personal level. An investment in any sector would then

earn a common return of .05, net of all taxes. In column 5 of table 5,
we present the tax rates under this alternative model, using a universal

net return of .05.

All provisions of the tax law and all other

assumptions are identical to those used in our standard estimates for
1982 law, which appears in column 1.

The most important message from this exercise is that the set of

rates of return or rates of taxation is not invariant to model
assumptions. We cannot find "the" 1982 marginal tax rates. Tax rates
under the alternative model are somewhat higher than under the standard
model: 33 percent as opposed to 26 percent for the economy as a whole.25

The previously reported subsidy of corporate equipment becomes a tax of

17 percent. It is encouraging, however, that the ranking of tax rates

for different assets and sectors is invariant to the choice of
assumption about arbitrage. Equipment still faces the lowest tax rates,
for example, and corporate inventories and land the highest.

Two other differences in results are worth mentioning briefly.
First, in the alternative model, elimination of the corporate income tax
results in a 2-point cut in the rate of taxation in the corporate sector

25 At other rates of inflation, however, the alternative model implies
tax rates that are less than those in the standard model.

-40-

(as opposed to a 2-point increase).

Second, the variability in the

overall cost-of-capital as a result of inflation is much less than in
our standard model.

E. Assumptions about the Rate of Return

In another set of experiments, we use the standard model and vary s,

the mean net-of-tax return. These results do not appear in the table.

The overall tax rate falls from 36 percent at s.02 to 25 percent at
s.06, which in part reflects the division of the tax wedge by a larger
value of p. This result again underscores the fact that the measurement

of tax rates is not unique. The sensitivity of the tax rate to the
assumed after-tax rate of return appears to be especially large in the

case of a subsidy: the tax rate on corporate equipment varies between
-128 percent at s.02 to - .3 percent at s.06.

The study of sensitivity to s reveals a couple of pitfalls in judging

relative tax rates for different assets. In a result reminiscent of the
earlier inflation sensitivities, relative tax rates change as s changes.

For example, while the tax rate for corporate land is 2 percentage
points higher than the tax rate for corporate structures at our standard

value for s, it is 45 percentage points lower when s is .02. Another
case illustrates dramatically the sensitivity of the dispersion of asset

tax rates to the choice of s. When s is .04, we find that all corporate
equipment depreciated over five years is taxed at exactly the same rate,

even though economic depreciation still varies among these assets. This

anomalous result occurs because the corporate discount rate associated
with an s of .04 happens to produce an equality between (1-u) and (1-k-

uaz). Equations of the Appendix indicate that 6 no longer enters in the

determination of p under this condition.

V. Conclusion

This paper has examined the marginal effective total tax rates on
capital as they have changed in the early 1980's. It has also looked at

these rates under alternative reforms and under alternative rates of
inflation. Our study covers many diverse assets and industries, as well

as aggregates for the corporate, noncorporate, and owner-occupied
housing sectors and the economy as a whole.

The tax law of 1982 results in a lower overall effective tax rate on

capital than existed under 1980 law.

It thus provides a larger

incentive to invest in real capital. At 26 percent, this overall tax
rate is also significantly lower than would be predicted by previous
studies that looked at average rather than marginal tax rates or that
emphasized equity finance at the margin.

An equally important aspect of recent tax changes is that they have
not, on the whole, reduced tax differentials among different assets and

industries. Our measure of the weighted deviation in the costs-ofcapital across the economy remains unchanged from 1980 law. In other
words, there has been no apparent improvement in the efficiency with
which capital is allocated across its various uses, despite the fall in

overall tax rates. We also find that the corporate tax system makes
significant contributions to tax rate differences, even though it makes
negative contributions to the overall tax on marginal investments under

our standard set of parameters. Additional inflation also contributes

-42-

to tax rate disparities without adding to the overall tax burden. There

is a lower weighted deviation, however, for reforms such as the
Auerbach-Jorgenson first year capital recovery plan and integration of
personal and corporate taxes.

TECHNICAL APPENDIX

Part A of this appendix describes potential uses of the tax rates of

this paper in examing intertemporal, intersectoral, and interasset
features of tax reforms in the 1980's.

Part B describes the exact

computation of the tax rates presented in this paper.

A. The Use of Tax Rates to Measure Efficiency Gains and Losses

It is easiest to explain the applicability of our study in the
context of previous efforts to measure the effects of tx distortions.

In particular, we follow the tradition of Harberger (1962,1966), who

used an analytical general equilibrium model

to measure

the

misallocation of real capital between the corporate and noncorporate

sectors. He found that the cost in efficiency from this distortion
amounts to about a half of one percent of GNP. This cost is a small
fraction of a number as large as gross national product, but it amounts

to between ten and twenty percent of the revenue obtained from the
additional tax on the corporate sector.

Shaven and Whalley (1972) showed how to incorporate taxes in a
computational general equilibrium model with more consumer groups and

production sectors, and this method is used in the larger more recent
general equilibrium model of Fullerton, Shaven and Whalley (FSW, 1978,

-44-

1983). This model measures the misallocation of capital among eighteen
industries, where tax differences arise because corporations make up a

larger fraction of firms in some industries, and because corporations

use different combinations of interest, dividends, and retained
earnings. The model also measures the misallocation of resources over
time that are due to extra taxes on saving for future consumption.

Tax rates in the FSW model are measured by the total of observed
corporate taxes, property taxes, and personal taxes as a fraction of

capital income in each industry. These tax rates can be revised to
capture the effects of each alternative tax scheme, but rates are then
held constant as the model calculates a new (counterfactua1) allocation

of capital among industries.

For this reason, the model does not

capture firms' efforts to affect their taxes by changing their mix of
assets or by changing their corporate status.

Another problem is that these "average" effective tax rates, measured

for existing assets, are applied to marginal uses of capital. Fullerton
and Henderson (1983) amend the FSW model to measure "marginalt' effective

tax rates explicitly for each asset, using the cost-of-capital approach

of Hall and Jorgenson (1967). A further advantage of these marginal
rates is that they can easily reflect changes in investment tax credits

and depreciation allowances such as those introduced with the
Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS) in 1981. Yet the model in that

paper assumes that each industry uses the different assets in fixed

-45-

proportions. Thus, while it measures intertemporal and interindustry
distortions, it still omits interasset distortions.

Misallocations among assets are measured in papers by Hendershott and

Hu (1980) and Gravelle (1981, 1982). They calculate the marginal costof-capital in the corporate sector for each asset, and they assume Cobb-

Douglas demands. By changing the cost-of-capital to reflect a new tax
law, or even to remove all asset distortions, they can simulate the new
economy-wide demand for each asset and measure the gain or loss in total

output. The new allocation reflects equilibrium in the market for real
capital but it is not a general equilibrium. Their models apply only to

corporate capital, not total capital.

They do not cature industry

misallocations, and they do not capture intertemporal misallocation
associated with the overall taxation of income from capital.

In this paper we compute tax rates that could be used in a more
general model that incorporates all of these decisions simultaneously.

When efficiency costs from all of these misallocations are combined,
they can add to substantially more than a half percent of GNP.

First, in such a model, a marginal effective total tax rate
(including corporate, personal, and property taxes) affects individual

choices between present and future consumption.

Saving for future

consumption affects the total available supply of capital in subsequent

periods. Second, in any one period, a marginal cost-of-capital formula

is used to determine the demand for capital in each of the eighteen

-46-

industries.

Third, within each industry, separate cost-of-capital

expressions are used to determine the division between corporate and
noncorporate sectors.

Fourth, within each sector of each industry,

individual cost-of-capital calculations are used to determine demand for
each of the different asset types.

We could simulate the change in any tax parameter such as a statutory

rate, credit rate, or depreciation lifetime, and we could calculate new

user costs for each asset in the general equilibrium model that we
envisage. These user costs depend endogenously on the real after-tax
rate of return determined in equilibrium. A composite of those costs
applies to each sector of a given industry, and an additional composite

of corporate and noncorporate costs applies to the overall use of
capital for that industry. Each industry has a different mix of assets

in each sector, as well as a different mix of sectors, all determined
endogenously. When the total use of capital equals the total available

supply, we have equilibrium in the capital market; when other markets
clear as well, we have a general equilibrium.

In a generalized model, we would not be limited to a unitary
elasticity of substitution among assets, as implied by the Cobb-Douglas
functional form.

Instead, capital in the corporate sector or in the

noncorporate sector of each industry would be a different Constant

Elasticity of Substitution (CES) composite of the 38 assets.

would also be pre-specified. When these elasticities are set to

zero, the generalized model would reduce to the one in Fullerton and
Henderson (1983). When they are unity, the model would be very similar

to that of Gravelle (1981,1982).

This generalization is important

and c have much bearing on the relative

attractiveness of alternative proposals.

B. Measurement of the Cost of Capital and Effective Tax Rates

We start with a cost of capital formula like that developed by Hall

and Jorgenson (1967). The underlying premise behind this formula is
that the profit maximizing firm will undertake a marginal investment
project if it earns a return net of tax such that the present value of

cash flows is at least equal to the initial outlay. Under competitive
equilibrium conditions the two will be exactly equal.

Consider a marginal investment with an acquisition cost q, a rental
price c, and wealth tax rate of w per dollar of asset. The rental price

is the amount for which the asset could be rented if the owner covers

maintenance, depreciation, and taxes.

If the statutory marginal

corporate income tax rate is u, and if the property tax is deductible,

-48-

then the rental net of property taxes and corporate taxes is (l-u)(c-

wq). This return is treated as certain, and it grows in nominal terms

at the rate of inflation, ir.

Further assume that the quantity of

capital embodied in the investment declines at the economic depreciation

rate .

As a consequence, the net-of-tax rental receipts from the

investment at time t will equal (l_u)(c_wq)eó)t. To derive the
present value of such a stream, these nominal cash flows would be
discounted at the nominal after-tax rate, r.

Capital cost recovery provisions affect the equilibrium rental rate

in two ways. First, an investment tax credit at rate k lowers the
acquisition cost of the asset from q to (l-k)q.

Se1cond, the firm

receives a reduction in taxes as a result of depreciation allowances.
Let

a denote the fraction of purchase price that is eligible for

depreciation allowances. The present value of this deduction per dollar

of basis will be denoted by z, so the total tax reduction is uazq. The
particular value for z will reflect the discount rate, the tax lifetime

for the asset, the depreciation schedule, and whether allowances are
based on historical or replacement cost.

With the inclusion of all

these features of the tax code, the equilibrium condition is expressed
as:

(1 —

k)q

=

J(l — u)(c — wq)e

tetdt + uazq

(Al)

From this expression we can solve for the rental rate c/q as a function

-49-

of the tax parameters as well as r, 6, and n. Finally, since cjq is
gross of depreciation, we subtract 6 to obtain the corporationt s real
rate of return net of depreciation:

q

(A2)

(1_k—uaz)+W6

1—u

This crucial expression is used to find the cost to the corporate firm

of employing any of the 38 assets. The discount rate, inflation rate,
and corporate tax rate do not vary by asset, but parameters such as 6,
k, a, z, and w are asset-specific. None of these parameters is specific
to any industry.

I

In the noncorporate sector, we assume that the firm must earn at
least its own discount rate r in nominal terms, after taxes at rate tnc

on any alternative investment. The noncorporate firm may use any of the

38 assets, and each has an equilibrium condition analogous to equation
(Al) above.

Corporate and noncorporate parameters are identical for depreciation

Discount rates differ,

however, so the present value of depreciation for any one asset (z)
depends on the sector.

A final cost-of-capital forumla applies to owner-occupied housing.
This asset earns a rental rate c, minus property taxes, of which X are

deducted from the personal income tax at rate Th•

The return

is not subject to income tax, but the investor receives no

credits or depreciation allowances. The return grows in nominal terms

at rate ir, depreciates at its own rate ó and is discounted at the
individual's- nominal after-tax rate r. Logic similar to that of (Al)
and (A2) implies the equilibrium condition:

and the required rate of return:

phC6=r+(1_AT)w

(A5)

The deductibility of mortgage interest is captured in the fact that
these flows are discounted by an after-tax rate of return.

1. Arbitrage at the Firm Level

Next we outline two possible models for the choice of discount rates.

In one model, as in Bradford and Fullerton (1981), we assume that the
firm arbitrages between debt and real capital. Instead of making this

investment, the firm can always use the marginal dollar of funds to

-51-

retire a dollar of debt, an action which would earn the after-tax
interest rate for the firm.

Therefore, each alternative asset must

yield the after-tax interest rate. If i is the nominal market interest
rate, then the discount rate in the corporate sector is i(l-u), in the

noncorporate sector it is i(l-t), and in owner-occupied housing it is
i(l_'rh). In any one sector, the discount rate does not depend upon the
actual sources of finance.

A proportion cns of corporate investment is financed by new shares
sold to individuals with tax rate r

ns

.

These investments earn i(l-u)

after corporate taxes, and this return is paid as dividends to the
owners who receive i(l-u)(1-t

)

after

all taxes. A prDportion cre is

financed by retained earnings, and the return i(l-u) is retained by the

corporation. Individual owners are taxed at t

re ,

the

effective accrued

rate on capital gains, and they receive i(l_u)(1_tre) after taxes. A
final proportion Cd is financed by debt sold to individuals with tax
rate td The firm pays interest at rate i and the individual receives
i(l_td) after taxes. When these different individuals are aggregated,
however, the average real net-of-tax return in the corporate sector is
defined as:

Sc

cd[i(lTd)] + Cre[1(1_U)(1_Tre)] + C [i(l—u)(l_T5)} —

Tr

(A6)

When we compare the pre-tax return pC to this average value of sC, we

implicitly assume that the marginal investment is financed by the

-52-

average proportions of debt, retained earnings, and new shares.

In the noncorporate sector, a fraction rid of investment is financed

through the market for debt.

The noncorporate firm pays the same

interest rate i, it deducts interest at rate tnc ,

and the interest

recipient earns i(l_td) after taxes. The remaining share ne is financed

by equity of the entrepreneur, who earns i(l-c) after taxes. The
average real net return in the noncorporate sector is

S

d11 — Td)]

—

+ et1(1 —

(A7)

Owner-occupants finance a fraction hd through debt, pay the market
interest rate i, and deduct interest payments at their statutory rate

th. The equity-financed share he must therefore earn i(lth) and the
average real net return is

hd[i(l —

Td)] + h[i(l - Th)]

(A8)

The average real net return for the economy is

hh
cc +Kncnc
Ks
S
+Ks
S=

KC+K+Kh

where K refers to the stock of capital in each sector.

(A9)

-53-

All calculations could proceed by setting the single market interest
rate i.

In the corporate sector, for example, the discount rate would

be i(l-u), the pre-tax return would be given by (A2), and the after-tax

return would be given by (A6).

Instead, we wish to use the ceteris

paribus assumption that the average real net return s is constant across

alternative tax regimes and different inflation rates. For this reason,

we set s at .05 in each case and then calculate the interest rate
compatible with above equations. We substitute (A6)-(A8) into (A9) and

solve for i as a function of s,

n, tax rates, finance shares, and

capital stocks. Under 1982 law with 7 percent inflation, for example, i

is .181. Because nominal income is subject to tax, infltion adds more
than proportionately to nominal interest in order to maintain the fixed
real after-tax return s. This relationship between 'ii and i is not based

on empirical observations but is a necessary consequence of the ceteris
paribus assumption on s.

2. Arbitrage at the Individual Level

The assumption of arbitrage at the firm level precludes the
possibility of arbitrage at the personal level.

i(l_td) if they purchase debt, i(l_u)(l-c)

Individuals receive

if they purchase new

shares, i(l-t) if they invest in a noncorporate firm, or i(l_th) if
they invest in housing. In an alternative model, we could assume that
individuals would adjust their portfolios until all these returns were

equal to the real net return from holding debt, s, redefined as

-54-

i(l_td) -

r.

The corporation's discount rate for debt is still i(l-u),

but a new share issue would have to earn a return after corporate taxes
such that dividends could be taxed at rate 'r

and still provide i(l_Td)

The discount rate for new shares thus

to the saver.

equals

iLtd/(lt)• By a similar logic, the discount rate for retained
earnings finance is i(l_rd)/(l'r). A weighted-average discount rate
for the corporation may be defined as:

Cd[l(l -

u)J

+ c[i( rs + e[i('

(AlO)

We can set s at .05, calculate i as (s+Tr)/(.l_Td), and use (AlO) for
corporate discounting.

By analogy, the entrepreneur's cost of deductible debt finance is

i(1-t). The equity-financed investment must earn enough that the
entrepreneur as an individual can pay taxes at rate

and still match

the return to holding debt, i(l_td). The weighted discount rate in the
noncorporate sector is thus:

—

To)]

+

—

Td)]

By further analogy, the weighted discount rate in housing is

(All)

-55-

hd[i(l —

Tb)] + h[i(1 — Td)]

(A12)

This second model has the advantage of a single after-tax return, but

this time the assumption of arbitrage at the personal level precludes

the possibility of arbitrage at the firm level.

The corporationTs

marginal investment earns a certain return after taxes given by (AlO),

an amount which exceeds 1(1-u). The firm thus forgoes the opportunity
to make pure profits by issuing one more unit of debt and undertaking
one more unit of investment.

It would be possible to reconcile these alternative models by
introducing a risk premium on equity and a portfolio choice model for
individuals.

Instead, for this perfect certainty model, we choose

reconciliation through market segmentation.

Firms arbitrage between

debt and real capital, as in the first model, and equilibrium is
established as in Miller (1977). Because some individuals hold only
debt and others hold only equity, there is no arbitrage at the personal
level.

Thus we use the first model for primary calculations in this

paper, but we test the sensitivity of these results by providing
calculations based on the second model.

A final note regards the presentation of each tax law in our tables.
The relevant information is embodied in various values of p, the gross-

-56-

of-tax returns, but we sometimes find it easier to interpret effective

tax rates. Since the various values of s represent the returns net of
all taxes, the differences p-s represent the combination of corporate

taxes, property taxes, and personal taxes.

If this difference is

expressed as a fraction of p, we have a marginal effective total tax

rate. These effective tax rates can be measured for each corporate

notational simplicity, we suppressed the index for assets (i1.. .38) in

all expressions above. If we use p to denote pC for asset i, and use

K. to denote the stock of that asset in the corporate part of industry

j,

then the effective tax rate for the corporate part of industry j may

be defined as:

We calculate similar tax rates for the noncorporate sector, replacing

all a superscripts with nc superscripts.

An overall rate for that

industry is defined as the sum of the numerators from t and
divided by the sum of the denominators. (The housing industry combines
rental and owner-occupied housing instead of corporate and noncorporate

sectors.) An overall rate for the economy is similarly defined as the
sum of the numerators from all industry tax rates divided by the sum
the denominators.
