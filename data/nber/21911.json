    "abstract": "\n\nWe demonstrate the central importance of creditors\u2019 ability to use \u201cmovable\u201d assets as collateral (as distinct from \u201cimmovable\u201d real estate) when borrowing from banks. Using a unique cross-country micro-level loan dataset containing loan-to-value ratios for different assets, we find that loan-to-values of loans collateralized with movable assets are lower in countries with weak collateral laws, relative to immovable assets, and that lending is biased towards the use of immovable assets. Using sector-level data, we find that weak movable collateral laws create distortions in the allocation of resources that favor immovable-based production. An analysis of Slovakia\u2019s collateral law reform confirms our findings.\n\n",
