An Assessment of the Benefits of Air Pollution Control:
The Case of Inf ant Death

ABSTRACT

This paper contains estimates of the impacts of air pollutants on
race—specific neonatal mortality rates based on data for heavily popu—

lated counties of the U.S. in 1977. Unlike previous research in this
area, these estimates are obtained from a well specified behavioral
model of the production of health, which is estimated with the

appropriate simultaneous equations techniques. The results suggest
that sulfur dioxide is the dominant air pollutant in newborn survival

outcomes. There is also evidence that an increase in sulfur dioxide
raises the neonatal mortality rate by raising the percentage of low—

birth weight births. Based on marginal—willingness—to—pay computations, we estimate that the benefits of a 10 percent reduction in
sulfur dioxide levels range between $54 million and $1.09 billion in
1977 dollars.

AN ASSESSMENT OF THE BENEFITS OF AIR POLLUTION CONTROL:
THE CASE OF INFANT HEALTH

I. Introduction
-

The controversy surrounding the work of Lave and Seskin (1970, 1973,

1977) on the negative effect of air pollution on aggregate mortality has
continued unabated for well over a decade. The debate has sharpened the
focus of succeeding research by calling attention to such issues as
simultaneity (Gerking and Schulze 1981; Crocker et al. 1979), confounding
(Schwing and MacDonald 1976; Lave and Chappie 1982), functional form (Smith
1976), and the impact of priors on model specification (Atkinson, Crocker,

and Murdock 1985). Moreover, efforts to place a monetary value on the
benefits of reduced pollution have also evolved. Emphasis on lost productivity (Lave and Seskin 1977) has given way to the theoretically more

appealing measure of willingness to pay (Rosen 1981; Gerking 1983). Cross—
sectional mortality studies are not a substitute for micro—level data based

on individually monitored exposure. Nevertheless, a well—structured ecological study can provide evidence of potentially causal relationships bet-

ween pollution and mortality. In addition, aggregate studies remain a
practical means of "observing large numbers of people and environments in

less than 'real time.'" (Lave and Chappie 1982, p. 348).
This paper is an attempt to incorporate many of the insights from past
studies of pollution and mortality in order to measure the impact of air
pollution on race—specific neonatal mortality rates (deaths within the first
27 days of life per thousand live births) across heavily populated counties

—2--

in the U.S. In 1977. Our study differs from previous research in the
pollution area in that it is the first one that simultaneously (1) adopts a
behavioral model of the production and demand for health, (2) employs a
health indicator (neonatal mortality) that has a well documented relation
to a set of medical and nonmedical inputs,' (3) recognizes that the inputs

are endogenous variables and therefore uses the proper econometric techniques to obtain the best available estimates from which willingness—to—pay
figures can most justifiably be approximated, (4) uses more recent data

than Lave and Seskin (1977) and Crocker et al. (1979), and (5) performs an
ecological analysis on a larger sample than has previously been attempted.
Since the data are more recent they are more relevant to present policy

discussions. Moreover, the recent automation of the Environmental
Protection Agency's Storage and Retrieval of Aerometric Data (SAROAD)
system has improved the accuracy with which data on the pollutants are
collected and measured.

The advantages of focusing on neonatal mortality in research on the

health effects of air pollution are also worth stressing. The infant mortality rate (deaths of infants within the fIrst 364 days of life per
thousand live births) is approximately equal to the mortality rate of 55 to

64 year olds and much higher than age—specific death rates of persons bet-

ween the ages of 1 and 54. The neonatal mortality rate is twice as large
as the postneonatal mortality rate (deaths of infants between the ages of

28 and 364 days per thousand live births). Moreover, accidents, which
clearly are not related to pollution, are an important cause of post—
neonatal deaths.. Expectant mothers are unlikely to move during their

—3—
pregnancies. Thus, studies of the relationship between pollution and
neonatal mortality are not subject to the criticism that adults who die in
one location may have been exposed to pollutants at other locations during
their lifetimes.

In spite of the differences between our research and prior work in this

area, previous research provides a basis for applying our framework to

study the impacts of air pollution on infant health. Lave and Seskin
(1973) fit dose—response functions in which the neonatal mortality rate
(not race—specific) for 117 Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSAs)

in 1960 or 1961 is the dependent variable. These rates are positively
related to total suspended particulate and sulfate concentrations in their
ordinary least squares multiple regressions in 1960, and they are positi-

vely related to particulate concentrations in 1961. The 1960 sulfate
effect and the 1961 particulate effect are statistically significant. Lave
and Seskin (1977) use the same data set to study the effects of air pollution on total infant mortality (deaths of infants within the first 364 days
if life), race—adjusted infant unrtality, and race—specific infant mor-

tality. In general, the particulate regression coefficient is positive and
statistically significant, while the sulfate coefficient is positive and

insignificant. Futhermore, in a smaller sample of SMSAs, in which additional pollutants were also examined, sulfur dioxide evidences a statisti-

cally significant association with infant mortality. Crocker et al.
(1979), in a sample of 60 u.s. cities in 1970, report a positive and significant effect of sulfur dioxide concentrations in the air on deaths from
early infant diseases (not race—specific), most of which occur within the

—4—
first 27 days of life. The particulate coefficient in their regression is
positive and not significant, and the nitrogen dioxide coefficient is nega-

tive and not significant. Mendelsohn and Orcutt (1978) find that nitrates
and particulates have a statistically significant effect on white male
infant mortality rates but no effect on female rates across 404 county

groups in 1970. These results are not consistent with their primary
finding that sulfates are positively related to mortality among adults and
that the effect increases with age.

II. Analytical Framework
Following Grossman and Jacobowitz (1981), Rosenzweig and Schultz (1981,
1982, 1983a, 1983b), Corman and Grossman (1985), Corman, Joyce, and
Grossman (1985), and Joyce (1985), we assume that the parents' utility
function depends on their own consumption, the number of births, and the
survival probability of each of their offspring (assumed to be the same for

each infant in a given family). Both the number of births and the survival
probability are endogenous variables.

In particular, the survival probabi—

lity production function depends upon such endogenous inputs as the quantity and quality of medical care, maternal cigarette smoking, the use of
abortion services, and the use of family planning services.2 In addition,
the production function is affected by the reproductive efficiency of the
mother, including the unobserved biologically endowed probability that her
infant will survive the first month of life, and other aspects of her effi-

ciency in household production. Finally, the production function depends
on the quality of the environment as reflected by the levels of various
3
pollutants.

—5—

Maximization of the parents' utility function subject to production and
resource constraints generates a demand function for survival in which the
survival probability or its complement, the neonatal mortality rate, is
related to input prices (whose direct and indirect cost components are
negatively related to input availability), efficiency, income, environmen-

tal quality, and tastes. The interaction between the survival demand and
production function determines demand functions for medical care and other

endogenous inputs. These demand functions depend on the same set of
variables as the demand function for survival. Environmental quality is a
relevant argument in the input demand functions because high levels of
pollution may, for example, induce individuals to obtain larger quantities
of preventive or curative medical care or to smoke less.
The

preceding ideas are formalized in a structural equations model that

incorporates the relationship between neonatal mortality and its two most
proximate determinants — low birth weight and prematurity.

there

En particular,

is an overwhelming amount of evidence that low birth weight (less

than or equal to 2,500 grams or 5.5 pounds) is the most important endoge—
nous risk factor in neonatal survival outcomes (for example, Harris 1982;

Lewit 1983; Institute of Medicine 1985). There also is a considerable
amount of evidence that prematurity, reflected by gestational ages of 36
weeks or less, is the most important and most proximate endogenous risk
factor in birth weight outcomes (for example, Taffel 1980; Rosenzweig and

Schultz 1981, 1982, 1983b; Harris 1982; Lewit 1983). The system of
equations is designed to obtain estimates of the direct and indirect
(through low birth weight) effects of five basic health inputs and air

—6--

pollution on neonatal mortality. These inputs are prenatal medical care,
perinatal and neonatal care, the use of abortion services, the use of

contraceptive services, and maternal cigarette smoking. The equations in
the model have meaningful interpretations both at the family level and at

the county level. The latter is the unit to which the empirical analysis
in this paper pertains.

The basic model consists of the following nine equations:
1 — it

f1(n,

m, a, c, q, b, e)

(1)

b =

f2(m, a, c, q, s, g, e)

(2)

g =

f3(m, a, c, q, r, e)

(3)

r =

f4(a,

(4)

(7)

c

f8(p, y, q, x, e)

(8)

s =

f9(p,

(9)

c, x, e)

y, q, x, e) .

Equations (1), (2), (3), and (4) are production functions, while equations

(5)—(9) are input demand functions. In equation (1) the probability that
an infant dies within the first month of life or the neonatal mortality
rate at the county level (1—IT, where ii

is

the survival probability) is

shown as a vector of perinatal and neonatal care inputs (n), a vector of
prenatal medical inputs (m), the use of abortion services (a), the use of
contraceptive services (c), environmental quality (q, which rises as the
level of air pollution falls), the probability that the infant is born

light (b), and the infant's biological endowment (e).4 In equation (2) the

—7

probability of a light (2,500 grams or less) birth or the fraction of light
births in a county is a function of the variables in equation (1) except
neonatal care and also depends on maternal cigarette smoking (s) and the
probability that the birth is premature (g, which represents the probabi-

lity that gestational age is less than 37 weeks). In equation (3) the probability of a premature birth or the county—level fraction of such births
is related to the variables in equation (2) except cigarette smoking and
also an endogenous risk factor in prematurity such as mother's age at birth

(r).5 In equation (4) the endogenous risk factor is expressed as a function of its determinants, including an observed exogenous risk variable (x,

a measure of which is specified in Section III). In equations (5)—(9) the
inputs depend on a vectot of price and availability measures (p), socioeconomic characteristics that reflect command over resources and tastes (y),
the exogenous risk measure, environmental quality, and the biological
endowment. Each of the- nine equations contains an unspecified disturbance
In addition each

term (u1, 1=1,..., 9) that is uncorrelated with
is1

is

uncorrelated with the set of right—hand side variables in the

equation that contains it.

The four production functions are structural equations because they

show relationships among endogenous variables. Substitution of the input
demand functions and equations (3) and (4) into (1) and (2) yields demand
functions for survival and birth weight:

= f10(p,

1 —
b

y, q, x, e)

f11(p, y, q, x, e) .

(to)

(11)

These are reduced form equations because only exogenous variables appear on

—8--

their right—hand sides. Together with the input demand functions, they
constitute the reduced form of the model.

Given our interest in obtaining marginal—willingness—to—pay measures
(see below), we focus on the estimation of the structural neonatal mortality rate production function (1) and the quasi—structural mortality production function obtained by substituting equations (2), (3), ankd (4) into
equation (1):
1 —

it = f12(n,

m, a, c, q, s, x, e).

(12)

This procedure enables us to calculate the direct and indirect (through low
birth weight) effects of the basic health inputs and environmental quality
on neonatal mortality.
If the infant's biological endowment (a) were an observed variable,

unbiased estimates of the production function could be obtained by ordinary

least squares. Since this is not the case, the endowment must be treated
as one component of the disturbance term in each equation. Hence, our
model generates a recursive system of equations whose disturbance terms may

be correlated. In particular, although the researcher has no information
about the endowment, the mother and her physician have at least some infor-

mation about it. This information is likely to lead mothers with poor
endowed birth outcomes and their physicians to try to offset these unfavorable prospects by choosing a different mix

of

inputs than other mothers

(Rosenzweig and Schultz 1981, 1982, 1983a, 1983b; Harris 1982).

To be specific, mothers with poor endowments have incentives to seek
prenatal care earlier in their pregnancies than other women, and their phy-

sicians are likely to obtain larger amounts of neonatal care for them. In

—9—
addition, such women are more likely to smoke less, to abort their pregnan-

cies, or to use contraceptive services. Under these circumstances, ordinary least squares estimates of the parameters of the production function
are biased and inconsistent because the inputs are correlated with the

disturbance term, which reflects in part the endowment. In particular, the
effects of the inputs on favorable infant health outcomes are understated.6
To circumvent the above problem, production functions are obtained by

two—stage least squares. In the first stage of this procedure, the input
demand functions and the reduced form birth weight equation are fitted with
explanatory variables that are uncorrelated with the endowment by assump-

tion. In the second stage the predicted values of the inputs and low birth
weight rather than the actual values are used as regressors.
It should be noted that the biases that arise when equation (12) is

estimated by ordinary least squares are likely to be more severe than the

biases that arise when equation (1) is estimated in a similar manner. This
is because equation (1) includes birth weight, which may be a very useful

proxy for the infantts endowed probability of survival. Put differently,
it is possible that the endowment has no effect or a smaller effect on

neonatal mortality with low birth weight held constant. We explore this
proposition in empirical tests discussed in Sections III and IV.
Certain restrictions oust be imposed to insure that each equation in

the system satisfies rank and order conditions for identification. The

most important restrictions are: (1) neonatal care has no impact on low
birth weight; (2) cigarette smoking affects neonatal nurtality only through
its effect on low birth weight; (3) prematurity affects mortality only

— 10 —

through low birth weight; and (4) cigarette smoking has no effect on prematurity. With regard to the first restriction, decisions to use neonatal
care services are made after birth, and low birth weight causes more use of

these services.7 For the other assumptions, there is considerable supporting evidence.8

To allocate scarce resources among competing goals, policy makers
require information about the dollar values of the potential health benefits associated with improvements in environmental quality (reductions in

pollution). The benefits of a small (incremental) reduction in pollution
is given by marginal willingness to pay, defined as the amount of income
that nvst be taken from an individual to leave him as well off as pre-

viously (to hold his level of utility constant) when the level of pollution

declines. Marginal willingness to pay can be obtained directly from the
health production function and is independent of the demand function
(Freeman 1979; Rosen 1981; Gerking 1983; Harrington and Portney 1983).

It

is given by the marginal product of environmental quality in the production
function multiplied by the ratio of the price of an endogenous health input
such as prenatal medical care utilization to the marginal product of that

input. The ratio just mentioned coincides with the marginal cost of producing health.

In the context of our model, the marginal willingness to pay (dy,

defined to be positive) for an increase in environmental quality of dq is
dy =

(13)

nq(p/it)dq.

here a subscript denotes a partial derivative, flq

is

the marginal product

of environmental quality (the increase in the survival probability caused

— 11. —

by a snail increase in environmental quality), and

is the marginal pro-

duct of prenatal care. In equilibrium the ratio of the price of an input

solely to produce infant health to its marginal product is the same

used

for all inputs. Therefore, if

p' is

the price of neonatal care and it is

its marginal product, an alternative estimate of marginal willingness to
pay

is given by

dy =

7rq(P'JTt)d.

(14)

Marginal—willingness—to—pay measures based on equations (13) and (14)
are presented in Section IV.9 Particularly in the case of prenatal care,

the quasi—structural production function is the most relevant one to

the

computations. This is because prenatal care has its main

neonatal

use in

effect on

mortality via low birth weight (for example, Corman, Joyce, and

Grossman 1985).

10

Note that in a somewhat more general model where other aspects of
health in addition to the survival of neonates enters the utility function,
the formula for marginal willingness to pay given by equation (13) or (14)

would be the correct theoretical construct if and only if environmental
quality, prenatal care, and neonatal care affected neonatal mortality outcomes alone. However, if environniental quality affects the health of
children, adolescents, and adults and other aspects of their well being
such as cognitive development, then we understate willingness to pay.

Finally, if medical care also affects those outcomes, which is plausible
since

of

they are known to depend on birth weight and health in the first year

life (for example, Edwards and Grossman 197.9; Shakotko, Edwards, and

Grossman 1981), the direction of the bias is indeterminant. These caveats
should be kept in mind when the estimates are presented.

Empirical Implementation

A. Measurement of Variables
The neonatal mortality rate production functions are estimated with a
data set that pertains to the 677 most populated counties of the United

States. These are counties with a population of at least 50,000 persons in
1970.11 We have constructed this data base from a variety of sources and
have described it in detail in Corman and Grossman (1985), Corman, Joyce,

and Grossman (1985), and Joyce, Grossman, and Goldman (1986). Table 1 contains definitions, means, and standard deviations of the variables used in
this study.

The mortality production functions focus on the neonatal mortality rate
as opposed to the postneonatal mortality rate or the total infant death

rate. This strategy is adopted because most neonatal deaths are caused by
congenital anomalities, prematurity, and complications of delivery. These
conditions are more sensitive to improved prenatal, perinatal, and neonatal
care than are the infectious diseases and accidents that contribute to

postneonatal mortality. Moreover, accidents clearly are not related to
pollution, and expectant mothers are unlikely to move during their pregnancies.

Separate regressions are fitted for white and black outcomes. Black
infant health levels are much lower than white levels. For example, in
1977 the black neonatal mortality rate was roughly twice as large as the

white rate. In a non—race—specific regression, one would enter the percentage of black births to control for race differences. But this variable
would be highly correlated with the use of prenatal care and other inputs.

By fitting race—specific regressions, unlticollinearity is reduced, and the
coefficients of the inputs and the pollutants are allowed to vary between

races. Moreover, in preliminary regressions we tested and rejected the
hypothesis that slope coefficients but not intercepts are the same for whites and blacks.

Counties are our units of observation rather than Standard Metropolitan
Statisitical Areas (SMSAs) or states because counties tend to be more homogeneous with respect to key variables such as income, schooling, medical

resources, and pollution. Some counties are so sparsely populated,

that people may

receive

medical care outside the county. Also,

small counties, with few

births,

experience large fluctuations in birth

however,

rates

simply due to random movements. The problems with county data are

reduced by including only counties with a population of at least 50,000

persons In 1970. A county nust also have at least 5,000 blacks for inclusion in the black data base. There are 677 counties in the white sample
and 357 counties in the black sample. The counties in the white data set
accounted for approximately 80 percent of the white population of the U.S.

in 1970, and the counties in the black data set accounted for a similar

percentage of the black population of the U.S. in that year. In addition
to selecting large counties, we attenuate random elements by employing a
three—year average of the race—specific neonatal mortality rate for the

period

1976—1978 as the dependent variable.

The air pollution variables were taken from the Environmental
Protection

ency's Storage and Retrieval of Aerometric Data (SAROAD).

This is an automated data processing system used by EPA for the storage of

— 16 —

data

concerning concentrations of the six criteria air pollutants in the

atmosphere: carbon monoxide, lead, sulfur dioxide, total suspended par—
ticulates, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone. These are pollutants for which
National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) have been established as

part of the Clean Air Act. All major cities and one—third of all counties
have at least one monitoring station, although a number of stations are not

operative, and many others do not monitor all the pollutants. In preliminary regressions (not shown in Section IV), ozone never had a positive and

statistically significant coefficient. Therefore, it was discarded from
the set of pollutants.

The raw data in SAROAD take the form of hourly concentrations of carbon
monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and weekly concentrations of
lead and total suspended particulates.12 To obtain county—specific estima-

tes of pollution the following algorithm was used. Counties in the data
base were divided into census tracts or minor civil divisions in counties

with no census tracts. Exposure measures for these smaller units by pollutant and year were computed as weighted (by the number of readings) avera-

ges of the monitor averages. Then county averages were obtained as
weighted averages of the tract or the division averages, where the weight
was the population density (population per square mile in 1980) of each

tract or division in a given county. Finally, the pollutant—specific four—
year average for the county was calculated as a simple average of the four
annual averages.'3 If data were missing for one or two years, a three— or

two—year average was computed. If an annual average was available for a
14

single year alone, that figure was used.

— 17

—

Complete data on the five pollutants are available for 102 of the 677
counties in the white sample and for 86 of the 357 counties in the black

sample. Instead of limiting our production functions to these two sub—
samples, we define six subsamples for each race. The first five include
counties in which a given pollutant measure is available, regardless of

whether data on the other four pollutants are present. Each of the five
subsamples is used to estimate a production function in which the pollutant

at issue alone and the health inputs are included as regressors. The sixth
subsample includes counties with data on all pollutants and is used to fit
a production function in which the five pollutants are entered as explana-

tory variables. It is worth noting that the means and standard deviations
of the neonatal mortality rate and the health inputs are very similar in
the seven samples for each race (the total sample and the six subsamples).

The five basic inputs used in the production of infant health are
neonatal intensive use, prenatal care use, the abortion rate, the use of

family planning clinics by teenagers, and adult per capita smoking. Except
for

smoking, all the inputs should be negatively related to the measures of

infant health described above.'5 Low birth weight, the endogenous risk fac-

tor in

the structural neonatal mortality rate production function [equation

(1)] is given by a three—year average of the percentage of births of 2,500
grains or less centered on 1977. The final explanatory variable represents
the exogenous risk factor (x) in the quasi—structural production function

[equation (12)]. For this variable, we use the number of women who are
either teens or in their forties as a fraction of all women of childbearing

Estimation and Functional Form
The neonatal mortality equations (1) and (12) are fitted using a two—

stage least squares procedure for the reasons discussed in Section II.
Specifically, the unobserved health endowment, which is captured in the

error ten of the production function, is believed to be correlated with
the use of the health inputs. Rosenzweig and Schultz (1982) refer to this

problem as population "heterogeneity." Such 'heterogeneity" causes ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates to be biased and inconsistent. If
income and input availability measures are uncorrelated with the health
endowment, however, these variables can serve as instruments in a two—stage
least squares (TSLS) estimation procedure.

We test for the significance of the correlation between the production
function residuals and the health inputs, using Wu's T2 statistic (Wu 1973)

as described by Nakamura and Nakamura (1981). If the null hypothesis of
zero correlation between the error term and the regressors is not rejected,

then OLS is an appropriate technique. For this reason, we perform OLS as
well as the two—stage least squares technique on equations (1) and (12).
A comparison of Wu statistics for equations (1) and (12) allows us to examine whether birth weight is a reasonable proxy for the health endowment.
In the first stage of our two—stage estimation procedure, birth weight,

prenatal care, neonatal intensive care, abortion, and organized family
planning use are predicted on the basis of the pollutants, female
schooling, female poverty levels, the fraction of high—risk women, neonatal
intensive care availability, abortion availability, organized family
planning availability, maternal and infant care project availability, corn—

— 19 —

munity health center availability, and the Medicaid program. With the
exception of the pollutants, these right—hand side variables are similar to
those used in Corman and Grossman's (1985) reduced form estimates.
Predicted values of the five endogenous variables are then entered into the

neonatal mortality equations. We do not estimate values for the smoking
variable in a first stage because the smoking variable was already estimated on the basis of income, price, education, age, sex and race, as

described in Joyce, Grossman, and Goldman (1986). Our procedure is based
on the reasonable assumption that prenatal and neonatal input availability
measures have zero coefficients in the cigarette demand function.'6
Since the neonatal survival probability Cr) ranges between zero and
one, we specify the production function as a logistic equation:
it

= [1

+

exp(—a—1ln q—2ln m—S31n n—4ln

w)].

(15)

Here q is environmental quality, m is prenatal ndical care, n is neonatal
intensive care, w is a vector of additional explanatory variables, ln

stands for natural logarithm, and the disturbance term is suppressed. By
solving for the logarithm of the odds of survival relative to death
one transforms the logistic function into a linear equation:
ln[ic/(1—it)1 =

a + S1ln q +

2ln

m +

1331n

n +

41n

w,

which is called the logit function. The logit coefficient ,

(16)

for

example,

shows the percentage change in the odds of survival for a one percent

change in the quality of the environment. Given that the production func-

tion is logistic, the marginal—willingnesstOPay measure [see equations
(13) and (14)] becomes17

dy =

p(1/2)(mIq)dq

=

p'(1/3)(n/q)dq,

(17)

— 20 —

where p is the price of prenatal care and p' is the price of neonatal
intensive care. According to equation (17), marginal willingness to pay
falls as the quality of the environment rises or as the level of pollution

falls. Moreover, willingness to pay rises as prenatal care or neonatal
intensive care rises. These extremely appealing theoretical properties are
the result of the assumption that the logit function is linear in the

logarithms of in, q, and n, and justify this assumption.'8 In addition, if
interactions among pollutants are ignored, it is logical to define the
level of pollution (z) as

Z =

q.

(18)

Since we take ln[(l—n)/it] as the dependent variable, the final form of the
equation to be fitted is:
ln[(1—ir)/ir] = —a ÷ S1ln z —

S21n

ru —

631n

n —

E4ln w. (19)

Note that the marginal willingness to pay for a percentage increase in
environmental quality (dln q) is exactly the same as the marginal
willingness to pay for a percentage reduction in pollution (din z):
dy =

p(S1/2)m

dln q =

—p(1I2)m

dln z = —p'(S11S3)n dln z. (20)

Equation (19) is estimated with all explanatory variables except the
percentage of teenagers who use organized family planning services and the

fraction of high—risk women in natural logarithms. The former variable is
entered in arithmetic form because it equals zero in certain counties,

while the latter is entered in arithmetic form because it is not an endoge—

nous health input. The logit coefficients of prenatal care, abortion,
family planning, and neonatal intensive care are expected to be negative,

and the coefficients of the pollutants, cigarette smoking, low birth

—21—

weight, and high—risk women are expected to be positive. Maddala (1983)
shows that a weighted least squares procedure should be employed to fit a

logit model to grouped data. The weights are given by

where B is the number of race—specific births in the th county. Results
obtained with such alternative function forms as the linear and log—linear
models do not differ in a qualitative sense from those presented in Section

v. 19
IV. Results
Ordinary least squares (OLS) and two—stage least squares (TSLS) estimates of the white and black logit neonatal mortality rate production func-

tions are contained in Tables 2 and 3. Panel A in each table pertains to
the full white and black samples. No pollution measures are included in
the four regressions in panel A. The first two regressions (2—1, 2—2, 3—1,
and 3—2) exclude the endogenous risk factor of low birth weight while the
ensuing two (2—3, 2—4, 3—3 and 3—4) include the percentage of low—birth

weight births as an explanatory variable. Panel B of Tables 2 and 3 pertaIns to the white and black sulfur dioxide samples. We present detailed
results for the sulfur dioxide èainple because, unlike the other four pollu-

tants, sulfur dioxide has a consistently negative and statistically signi-

ficant impact on newborn survival. As shown below, this is true regardless
of whether sulfur dioxide is the sole pollutant or one of five in the

production function. As with Panel A, Panel B contains OLS and TSLS estimates of the production functions with and without the endogenous risk fac-

tor. Finally, Panel C of Tables 2 and 3 presents the production function
estimates with all five pollutants. Panel C follows the same format as

Ordinary Least Squares and Two—Stage Least Squares Estimates of Logit Neonatal Mortality Rate Production Functions
B lack 9a

— 25 —

Panels A and B.
An overview of the results in Panel A of Tables 2 and 3 indicates that

all the health inputs have the anticipated signs. In particular, in the
specifications that omit the percentage of low—birth weight births, the
logit coefficients of teenage family planning use, abortion, prenatal care,

and neonatal intensive care are negative, while the logit coefficient of

cigarette smoking is positive. In the case of whites, 14 out of the 18
coefficients are significant at the 5 percent level, With respect to the
blacks, 13 of 18 coefficients have t—ratios greater than one. In most
cases the magnitudes and significance levels of the input coefficients do

not vary dramatically among the three samples (Panels A, B, and C). A
Chow test was used to determine whether the neonatal mortality regressions
in the samples that contain pollutants differed from the regressions in the

non—pollution samples. The null hypothesis of no difference was never
rejected when comparing the four sulfur dioxide regressions with the

regressions from counties that have no sulfur dioxide monitors. When the
same test was performed with the five pollutant sample, the null hypothesis
of no difference was rejected in two out of the four cases at the 5 percent
level.

20

A comparison of the TSLS and OLS estimates reveals that the TSLS coefficients of prenatal care, abortion, and family planning are substantially

larger than the corresponding OLS coefficients. These findings reflect
decisions by women with unobserved poor endowed birth outcomes to initiate

care earlier in their pregnancies than other women. In addition, such
women are more likely to abort their pregnancies and use organized family

— 26 —

planning services. The existence of these relationships biases OLS estimates of the production function parameters of prenatalcare, abortion, and
family planning toward zero. Furthermore, the result that this difference
is greater for blacks underscores the argument by Rosenzweig and Schultz
(1983a) that OLS and other direct correlational estimates of prenatal
care's effect on early infant deaths may be seriously underestimating its
true impact on infant health.

Based on the Wu test, the null hypothesis of zero correlation between
the health inputs and the disturbance term is rejected at the 5 percent

level in the full—sample, white regressions (2—1, 2—3). In the case of
blacks, the null hypothesis is rejected at the 10 percent level in

regression (3—1). In the smaller samples which contain data on pollutants,
the null hypothesis can only be rejected once (regression 3—7). It is
noteworthy that in the full sample the Wu statistic falls whea birth weight

is held constant. Similar results were obtained by Rosenzweig and Schultz
(1982, 1983b), Corman, Joyce, and Grossman (1985) and Joyce (1985). This
suggests that in the estimation of infant health production functions the
relevant intermediate birth outcome may be an effective proxy for endowed

health. Based on this result and the previous work just cited, we emphasize the TSLS estimates in specifications that exclude the percentage of
low—birth weight births and the OLS estimates in the equations that include
this risk factor.

The results from including sulfur dioxide as an exogenous determinant

of neonatal mortality are presented in Panel B of Tables 2 and 3. In all
eight specifications the coefficient of sulfur dioxide is significant at

— 27

—

the 5 percent level or better. Each of the other four pollutants was also
treated as an exogenous determinant of neonatal mortality. Table 4 presents the coefficients and t—ratios of each pollutant estimated by OLS as

well as TSLS for both the white and black samples. These results reveal
that carbon monoxide and total suspended particulates have the most con-

sistently negative impact on early infant survival. However, when all five
pollutants are employed as regressors, sulfur dioxide is the only significant predictor of neonatal mortality (Panel C, Tables 2 and 3).
The environmental quality effects in Panel C of Tables 2 and 3 are our
most refined estimates because they include the full set of pollutants.
The conclusion that sulfur dioxide is the dominant pollutant should be
interpreted with some caution due to the intercorrelation among the five

measures. Nevertheless, this result is consistent with the regressions
that consider each pollutant one at a time, for the logit coefficients of
sulfur dioxide are the only ones that are always significant at conven-

tional levels. Note that the positive and significant sulfur dioxide coefficients in regressions (2—10), (2—11), and (3—10) are not artifacts of

the negative coefficients of some of the other pollutants. In specifications not shown, we deleted the pollutants with negative coefficients in

Panel C. The magnitude and significance of sulfur dioxide was unaltered.
There is also evidence that sulfur dioxide impacts on early infant

deaths by raising the percentage of low—birth weight births. Comparing
regressions 2—6 with 2—7 and 3—6 with 3—7, one sees that the inclusion of
low birth weight lowers the white sulfur dioxide coefficient by 21 percent

and lowers the black sulfur dioxide coefficient by 39 percent. The same

Pollution Coefficients from Ordinary Least Squares Estimates and Two Stage Least Squares Estimates of

comparison in the five pollutant sample reveals an even greater decline

(regressions 2—10 with 2—11 and 3—10 with 3—11). Nevertheless, since the
decrease in the magnitude of the sulfur dioxide coefficient is less than
fifty percent, the direct effect of this pollutant on neonatal mortality is
greater than its indirect effect through low birth weight in every case but
one.

In sum, the significance of our results is underscored by model which

generated them. By including measures of prenatal care and neonatal care
as well as abortion, we have controlled for three health inputs that have a

well—documented relationship to neonatal mortality. Moreover, these same
inputs have experienced dramatic increases in use during the 1970's, a
period during which the decline in neonatal mortality accelerated substan-

tially. Stated in Bayesian terms, we posses strong priors for the inclusion of these inputs (Atkinson, Crocker, and Murdock 1985). Furthermore,
by examining the impact of pollution on mortality holding the percentage of
low—birth weight births constant, we have effectively controlled for the

major socioeconomic risk factors (such as births to teenagers and unmarried

mothers) that operate through birth weight. In other words, the possibility that the association between sulfur dioxide and early infant deaths

represents a spurious relationship due to the omission of other health
inputs or risk factors is unlikely.

We conclude this paper by calculating the marginal willingness to pay
for declines in sulfur dioxide levels that result in increases in neonatal

survival rates. The computations are based on equation (20). Two alternative estimates are presented. In the first the marginal cost of

— 30 —

improving infant health outcomes is given by the ratio of the price of pre—
natal care to its marginal product. In the second marginal cost is given
by the ratio of the price of neonatal intensive care to its marginal pro-

duct. For reasons spelled out in Section II and the preceding portion of
this section, both computations are based on the TSLS estimates of the

quasi—structural production function. The logit coefficients are taken
from the sulfur dioxide sample rather than from the five pollutant sample
because the former is larger than the latter and because its input coefficients do not differ significantly from those of the full sample.
When prenatal care is used to measure the marginal cost of improving
the probability of infant survival, five pieces of information are required

to obtain marginal willingness to pay. These are the logit coefficient of

environmental quality (), the logit coefficient of prenatal care
the specified level of prenatal care (in), the percentage increase in

environmental quality divided by 100

(dln

q) or the percentage decline in

pollution (—dln z) divided by 100, and the price of prenatal care (p). For

whites, i equals .038, and
and

equals .516. For blacks, f equals .049,

equals .162. The specified value of prenatal care is the mean in

the sulfur dioxide sample: .784 in the case of whites and .599 in the case

of blacks. Since the marginal—willingness—to—pay formula pertains to small
changes, a 10 percent reduction in sulfur dioxide concentrations for each

race is considered (dln q =

.1).

If all expectant mothers began prenatal care in the first or second

trimester of pregnancy, the price or cost of starting care in the first
trimester approximately equals the total cost of three physician visits.

— 31 —

In

turn total cost is given by the direct (money) cost of the visits (the

payment to the physician) and the indirect cost (transportation cost plus
the sum of travel and waiting time multiplied by the opportunity cost of

time). Most physicians charge more for an initial visit than for a follow—
up visit. Fee information provided by the American Medical Association
(1984) reveals that obstetricians/gynecologists, who are the primary

suppliers of prenatal care, follow this pricing policy. Since a woman who
begins care in the second trimester uvst have an initial visit, we multiply

the price of a follow—up office visit to an obstetrician/gynecologist —

$17 in 1977 —— by three visits to obtain a direct cost component of $51.21
Colle and Grossman (1978) estimate the indirect cost of a pediatric

care visit at $3 in 1970. This is the sum of round—trip travel time and
waiting time multiplied by the hourly wage rate of a mother who works or
the potential hourly wage of a mother who does not work.22 Based on trends
in the hourly wage rate between 1970 and 1977, the comparable figure for

the latter year amounts to $5 per visit. Since Colle and Grossman ignore
transportation cost, we expand the indirect cost per visit to $7 based on

data given by Goldman and Grossman (1978). When multiplied by three

visits, this gives an indirect cost of $21. Consequently,the cost of
beginning prenatal care in the first trimester rather than in the second
trimester is $72 in 1977 dollars.

Along the same lines, the cost of beginning care in the first trimester
rather than the third trimester amounts to the total cost of six follow—up

visits: $144 in 1977 dollars. The cost of beginning care in the first trimester rather than obtaining no care at all involves the total cost of an

— 32 —

initial

visit and eleven follow—up visits. The AMA data indicate that the

direct cost of an initial visit was $29 in 1977. Therefore, cost of this
option comes to $276.

For each race, the total cost of beginning care in the first trimester
is defined as a weighted average of the cost of each of the three options.
The weight applied to, for example, the first option is the race—specific
number of births in which prenatal care began in the second trimester
divided by the race—specific number of births with no prenatal care in the

first trimester. This gives a total cost of $94 for whites and $100 for
blacks.

In the model outlined in Section II, parents in a given family allocate

the same quantity of resources to each birth. Therefore, the figures just
given are multiplied by the race—specific total fertility rates in 1977 ——

1.7 children for white women and 2.3 children for black women.23 This
yields a price of prenatal care equal to $160 for whites and $230 for

blacks. To the extent that prenatal care is financed by private health
insurance and Medicaid, the private price or marginal cost is overesti-

mated, although the social marginal cost is not. Under reasonable conditions, this implies that social marginal willingness on pay exceeds

private marginal willingness to pay.24 We focus on the former measure.
Based on the above data, the social marginal willingness to pay of a
typical white woman between the ages of 15 and 44 or her husband comes to
$1 and the corresponding figure for a typical black woman between the ages

of 15 and 44 comes to $4. In 1977 there were 34 million white woman in
childbearing ages in the 677 countries in our data base and 5 million black

— 33 —

women,

Collectively, these women or their families would have been willing

to pay $54 million (social marginal willingness to pay). in 1977 dollars for

the improved neonatal survival prospects associated with a 10 percent
reduction in sulfur dioxide concentrations.

When neonatal intensive care is used to measure the marginal cost of
raising the probability of infant survival, the logit coefficients of
neonatal intensive care (.147 for whites and .093 for blacks) replace those

of prenatal care in the computation of willingness to pay. The specified
levels of neonatal intensive care are .646 white patient days per birth and

1.591 black patient days per birth. Budetti et al. (1981) report that the
cost per case in a Level II or III neonatal intensive care unit was $8,000
in 1978 and that the average length of stay in such a unit was 13 days.

Based on trends in the medical care component of the Consumer Price Index
between 1977 and 1978, the cost per patient day in a neonatal intensive

care unit was $568 in 1977. Multiplying by the race—specific fertility
rates, one obtains a price of neonatal intensive care of $966 for whites
and $1,306 for blacks.25
The above data generate nuch larger values of social marginal

willingness to pay than those based on prenatal care. To be specific, the
social marginal willingness to pay of a typical white woman comes to $16

and that of a typical black woman comes to $110. The collective marginal—
willingness—to—pay—figure of $1.09 billion is approximately 20 times larger
than the $54 million sum associated with prenatal care.

The divergence between the two estimates of marginal willingness to pay
suggests that the same infant survival probability could be produced at

— 34 —

lower cost by spending less on neonatal intensive care and more on prenatal
care. This does not necessarily mean that pregnant women or their physi—
cians are selecting a non—optimal input mix. Given that neonatal intensive
care is financed to a very large extent by private health insurers, the
Federal government, and other third parties, the present input mix may well
be optimal (cost minimizing) front a private point of view. Of course, it
may also be the case that the differential impacts of neonatal care and
prenatal care on health outcomes beyond the first month of life justify the
current allocation of resources.

We want to emphasize that the main contribution of this paper is not
that we have obtained an upper—bound estimate of the benefits of a 10 percent reduction in sulfur dioxide levels of $1.09 billion in 1977 dollars

and a lower—bound estimate of $54 million. Instead, the main contribution
is that these estimates are obtained from a well specified behavioral model
of the production of health, which has been estimated with the appropriate

simultaneous equations techniques. They stand in sharp contrast to
existing figures that apply extraneous estimates of the value of life or
the earnings foregone by premature death to dose—response functions
obtained by ordinary least squares.

2The amount of time worked by the mother during pregnancy and her use
of alcohol are excluded from the theoretical model because of lack of data.
Rosenzweig and Schultz (1981, 1982, 1983b) exclude the number of months the
mother worked while pregnant from their final estimates of infant health
production functions because its coefficient was insignificant in prelimi-

nary regressions. In a recent report on low birth weight, the Institute of
Medicine (1985) concludes that the association between maternal alcohol use
and unfavorable birth- outcomes is ouch less uniform than that -between

maternal cigarette smoking and these outcomes. Heavy alcohol consumption
during pregnancy raises the risk of delivering a baby with fetal alcohol

syndrome. The empirical evidence is less clear, however, with respect to
the effects of moderate or light alcohol use.

3Following the literature on the estimation of dose—response functions

by economists and epidemiologists, we treat pollution as exogenous. In a
more complete model this variable would have an endogenous component
because the amount of exposure to multimedia pollutants and the ingestion
of these pollutants depend on decisions with regard to location, diet, and

occupation. In addition, at a more aggregate level, state and local
governments in areas with high initial mortality and morbidity rates and
high pollution levels may allocate resources to reducing these levels.
Note that there exist theoretical and empirical micro—epidemiological studies in which pollution is viewed as endogenous (for example, Spengler et
al. 1981; Duan 1982), but these studies do not contain estimates of dose—
response functions.

4Note that an increase in e is associated with a more favorable
endowment.

5other endogenous risk factors in the prematurity production function

include parity and legitimacy status of the birth. These factors are not
incorporated into the model because we do not estimate the prematurity pro-

duction function, as explained below. Clearly, we do not ignore the risk
indicators just cited because they are caused to a large extent by abortion
and contraceptive services at the county level.
6th the case of cigarette smoking, the detrimental impact of this input
is understated in absolute value.

7Given the advanced state of perinatal science, infants requiring

neonatal intensive care services may be identified prior to birth. Even in
this situation low birth weight still causes neonatal intensive care, and

F—3
causality from use to birth weight can be ruled out.

8The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (1980) summarizes

numerous studies supporting restriction (2). Restriction (3) is consistent
with research of the Institute of Medicine (1985) and Harris (1982).

Restriction (4) is supported by ltosenzweig and Schultz (1982, 1983b). In
part prematurity is excluded from equation (1) because gestational age is
difficult to measure and was not reported on the birth certificates of a

number of states during the period of our empirical analysis. If equation
(1) is viewed as the one that is obtained by replacing g and r by their

determinants, then cigarette smoking must be excluded from the prematurity

equation. This is necessary for the quasi—structural mortality and birth
weight production functions to satisfy the rank condition. These equations
are

-

it = d(n,

a, c, q, b, x, e)

If s enters the equation for 1 —

it, the

rank condition is satisfied for the
violated for the mortality produc-

tion function. Empirical estimates of the above mortality function (not
shown) do not differ from the ones presented in Section IV, which exclude
x.

9lnputs that affect arguments in the utility function besides infant
survival cannot be used to compute willingness to pay (Rosen 1981).
Therefore, abortion use, family planning use, and maternal cigarette
smoking are not employed.

'°Conceptually, neonatal care has no causal impact on birth weight.

F—4
Therefore, if birth weight is an ideal measure of the endowment, there are

two equivalent estimates of the neonatal care coefficient. One is obtained
from the structural production function fitted by ordinary least squares.

The second is obtained from the quasi—structural production function fitted

by two—stage least squares. In the latter case the use of instrumental
variables corrects for the correlation between neonatal care use and the
disturbance term, while in the former case the inclusion of low birth
weight accomplishes the same goal.
110ne county with a population of at least 50,000 persons in 1970 was

eliminated from the sample because it was the only such county characterized as an isolated rural county with no incorporated place with a popu—

lation of at least 2,500 persons in 1970. In addition, the District of
Columbia was excluded because of difficulty in defining its relevant market

area. In particular, many nonresidents use its sophisticated neonatal
intensive care hospitals, and these facilities are not likely to be widely

available to its relatively large black population. A second reason for
excluding the District of Columbia is that Stanley K. Henshaw, who estima—
tes resident abortion rates for the Alan Guttmacher Institute, informed us
that figures for the District of Columbia are very unreliable.
'2Certain monitors in SAROAD, called source monitors, are located very
near to factories and other large sources of industrial pollution.

Exposure readings from these monitors are misleading indicators of the
environmental quality of a typical resident of the county in question.

Consequently, source monitors were not used in the development of pollution

measures at the county level. There are no zeros in the SAROAD

data.

F—5
Instead, each pollutant has a minimum detectible level. If readings fall
below this point, then the observation is given the value of its particular
minimum detectible level.
13We experimented with a second algorithm that did not divide counties

into census tracts or minor civil divisions and did not employ population

density as a weighting factor. In this algorithm county averages were
obtained directly as weighted (by the number of readings) averages of the

monitor averages. Our results were unaltered. For a more detailed
discussion, see Joyce, Grossman, and Goldman (1986).

'4Two types of averages resulted from the algorithm: an arithmetic
average and a logarithmic average (the antilogarithm of which gives the

geometric mean). In addition the logarithmic standard deviation was

obtained. Since pollution measures typically have a log—normal distribution (for example, Tanner, D'Ottavia, and Gorber 1978), the logarithmic
mean plus two standard deviations was used to test and reject the hypothesis that the maximum pollution level is a more important determinant of

neonatal mortality than the mean level. The logarithmic means are employed
in the production functions employed in Section IV, but the estimated
effects are similar to those obtained with the logarithms of the arithmetic

means. The arithmetic means of the pollutants are presented in Table 1 to
underscore the close correspondence between the estimated pollution levels
in our data base and published figures for the U.S. as a whole during the
period from 1975 through 1978 (for example, Bureau of the Census 1983,
Table 355).

'5We focus on teenage family planning use because neonatal death rates

F—6
associated with births to teenage mothers are substantially higher than

births to women beyond the age pf 20 (for example, Joyce 1985). Moreover,
Forrest (1980) finds that the use of organized family planning services by

teenagers has a sizable negative effect on teenage birth rates. It follows
that the use of family planning services by teenagers may have a larger
impact on neonatal mortality than the use of these services by older women.
'6Although cigarette consumption is labeled as an endogenous variable in
Section IV, it should be noted that the same variable is used in OLS and
two—stage estimation procedures.

18Put differently, the assumption guarantees that an isoquant between

'91n preliminary regressions we experimented with measures pertaining
to population density, climate, and the percentage of employed persons who

work in manufacturing industries. The inclusion of these regressors had
very minor impacts on the coefficients of the pollutants and the health

inputs. Therefore, they are excluded from the regressions in Section IV.
20The two cases in which the null hypothesis was rejected were the white
specification including low birth weight and the black specification

excluding low birth weight. The F—statistics were 2.16 (6,665 df) and
2.79 (7,343 df), respectively.

F—7
21The reader is cautioned that obstetricians typically charge pregnant
women a flat fee for prenatal visits and the delivery of the child, rather

than a fee for each prenatal visit. This suggests that the AHA fee data
pertain to visits to obstetricians/gynecologists for services other than

prenatal care. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that the real
resource cost of a prenatal care visit is similar to the cost of a gyneco-

logical visit. It also is reasonable to assume that an obstetrician will
charge a lower flat fee to a woman who begins prenatal care after the first
trimester.

22The potential wage is estimated from a race—specific regression of
the natural logarithm of the hourly wage rate of working mothers on
mother's years of formal schooling, mother's years of experience in the
labor market, years of experience squared, and the number of children in the

family. Colle and Grossman present separate indirect cost estimates for
whites and blacks, but the two figures are very similar.
23The total fertility rate is the number of children a woman would
have in her lifetime if, at each year of age, she experienced the birth

rate occurring in the specified year. The total fertility rate of blacks
indicated in the text actually pertains to nonwhites.

24Price is multiplied by the quantity of prenatal care in the

marginal—willingness—to—pay formula (20). Therefore, social marginal
willingness to pay exceeds private marginal willingness to pay if the price
elasticity of demand for prenatal care is less than one in absolute value.

While there are no estimates of thisparameter, Ghez and Grossman (1980)
summarize a number of studies in which the price elasticity of demand for

F —8

physician visits by adults or children is less than one. Note that social
marginal willingness to pay is not necessarily overstated if social inargi—

nal cost is multiplied by the observed quantity of prenatal care in

equation (20). This depends on whether the observed quantity exceeds,
equals, or falls short of the socially optimal quantity. For a detailed
discussion of the latter concept, see Ghez and Grossman (1980).
25The indirect cost component of neonatal intensive care is ignored. To

be sure, a mother with an infant in a neonatal intensive care unit will

spend much more time in the hospital than otherwise. But she probably
would not have returned to her usual activities even if her infant had not

been hospitalized. It should be noted, however, that the psychic cost of
the hospitalization clearly is substantial.
