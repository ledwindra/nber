ABSTRACT
Psychological evidence indicates that decision quality declines after an extensive session of
decision-making, a phenomenon known as decision fatigue. We study whether decision fatigue
affects analysts’ judgments. Analysts cover multiple firms and often issue several forecasts in a
single day. We find that forecast accuracy declines over the course of a day as the number of
forecasts the analyst has already issued increases. Also consistent with decision fatigue, we find
that the more forecasts an analyst issues, the higher the likelihood the analyst resorts to more
heuristic decisions by herding more closely with the consensus forecast, by self-herding (i.e.,
reissuing their own previous outstanding forecasts), and by issuing a rounded forecast. Finally,
we find that the stock market understands these effects and discounts for analyst decision fatigue.

1. Introduction
The literature on the determinants of analyst forecasting behavior (e.g., Clement
1999; Bradshaw 2011) emphasizes the errors that derive from conflicts of interest (e.g.
Kothari, So, and Verdi 2016; Mola, and Guidolin 2009; Ljungqvist et al. 2007; Kirk
2011; Christophe, Ferri, and Hsieh 2010), and psychological bias (see Ramnath, Rock,
and Shane 2008 for a review of the literature). We test here whether analyst decision

fatigue (i.e., a decline in decision quality after an extensive session of decision-making)
affects forecasting behavior. Specifically, we investigate whether the number of forecasts
an analyst has already made during a given day affects the accuracy of the next forecast
the analyst makes on that same day. We also test whether analysts who have issued
more forecasts during a given day behave more heuristically in the form of herding in
their forecasts toward the consensus forecast, self-herding (i.e., reissuing their own
outstanding forecasts) or providing a rounded forecast (forecast that ends with zero or
five).
A large body of evidence in psychology suggests that judgments and decisions
made under greater pressure, distraction, or fatigue tend to be made more heuristically.
The distinction between heuristic and non-heuristic decision-making can be understood
using the classification of judgments and decisions emphasized by Kahneman (2011) and
initially introduced by Stanovich and West (2000). In this model, decisions arise either
2

from System 1, in which the decision is made using quick and easy intuitive cognitive
processes, or from System 2, in which decisions are the result of slow, rigorous reasoning
processes. System 2 thinking (i.e., non-heuristic decision-making) requires more mental
resources, so individuals tend to switch to System 1 thinking (i.e., heuristic decisionmaking) after an extended period of System 2 thinking.
We expect that analysts who use System 2 thinking will produce higher-quality
forecasts than System 1 thinking. We also predict that when analysts become mentally
fatigued, they will exhibit a reduced ability to issue an accurate forecast and are more
likely to use heuristics (System 1 thinking) when issuing a forecast. These heuristics
include techniques such as conforming to the consensus or reiterating a previous
forecast.
Baumeister et al. (1998) describe decision fatigue as a consequence of “ego
depletion,” defined as a draining of mental resources. They argue that the self-control
required for careful cognitive processing and systematic decision-making requires mental
resources that are in limited supply. Self-control is typically impaired when the
cognitive resources available for decision-making are low. Thus, when people devote
effort to complex decisions over a given period of time, the resulting decision fatigue
temporarily reduces the quality of their subsequent decisions. Many subsequent studies

3

in psychology have provided further evidence in support of decision fatigue (Baumeister
and Tierney 2012).
There is also anecdotal evidence that professionals are aware and concerned
enough about the negative effects of decision fatigue to take active steps to counteract
it. For example, President Barack Obama has explained that he minimizes his food and
clothing choices to improve his other decisions (Lewis 2012). Steve Jobs and Mark
Zuckerberg famously wear only limited styles and colors of clothing. Managers at hedge
fund Voss Capital wrote to investors that they encourage their employees to take
frequent breaks, even intraday naps or meditation, to prevent overuse of System 1
(“thinking fast”) and to avoid making mistakes (Wadhwa 2016).
However, the recent controversy over the reproducibility of experimental studies
in social psychology and other fields has also engulfed the large experimental literature
on ego depletion. For example, a large-scale multi-lab experimental study finds no
discernible ego depletion effects (Hagger et al. 2016). 1 Nevertheless, even Hagger and
Chatzisarantis (2016) in their rejoinder state that, “For the record, we think that egodepletion is a ‘real’ phenomenon analogous to cognitive fatigue.” They conclude with a
call for further study of the topic. One of the contributions of our study is to evaluate

This triggered commentaries on the study by Baumeister and Vohs (2016) and Sripada et al. (2016)
criticizing the strength of the treatments used to induce fatigue and raising other statistical issues in the
Hagger et al. (2016) paper. See also the rejoinder by Hagger and Chatzisarantis (2016).

decision fatigue using archival data on analyst forecasts instead of laboratory
experiments.
Our study is not the only one to use archival data to test for decision fatigue.
The effects of decision fatigue on decision-making have also been documented in a wide
variety of settings in other literatures such as political science (e.g., voting in
Augenblick and Nicholson 2015) and, more recently, in economics (e.g., purchasing a car
in Levav et al. 2010). Decision fatigue has also been shown to be important in major
life-changing decisions; for example, Danziger, Levav, and Avnaim-Pesso (2011) report
that parole judges rule less favorably toward prisoners as the morning approaches
lunchtime and as the afternoon approaches the end of the workday.
However, evidence as to whether decision fatigue affects professionals in the
capital market setting is very limited. Hirshleifer, Lim, and Teoh (2009) provide
evidence that on days when relatively more firms announce earnings, there is a stronger
post-earnings announcement drift which can be interpreted as consistent with investor
decision fatigue. However, the authors interpret this finding as a result of limited
attention. Our goal is to test specifically for decision fatigue effects in a professional
capital market setting.
For several reasons, analyst earnings forecasting provides an attractive context
for studying decision fatigue. First, analysts’ errors can be directly measured, allowing
5

us to test for degradation of decision quality. Second, analysts often make forecasts of
multiple firms in a single day, so it is feasible to test how the forecasting behavior of an
analyst varies with the number of forecasts she has already issued that day. Therefore,
the number of recently issued forecasts provides a proxy for analyst decision fatigue.
Third, firms are often followed by several analysts. This allows us to measure forecast
accuracy for the analyst relative to the consensus forecast. By using a measure of
relative forecast accuracy, we can mitigate firm characteristic effects on forecast
accuracy to isolate decision fatigue effects more successfully.
During the period for which data on the time issuance of individual analyst
forecasts are verified (i.e., 2002–2015), we find strong evidence that is consistent with
the negative effects of analyst decision fatigue on the accuracy of one-year-ahead EPS
forecasts. Forecasts by analysts are less accurate when they are issued after the analysts
have issued a greater number of forecasts for other firms that day.
We further investigate whether forecasts are made more heuristically as the
analyst issues more forecasts that day. We find that forecasts of decision-fatigued
analysts exhibit greater herding toward the prior consensus forecast. There is also
greater self-herding, which means that the forecasts are also more likely to be
reissuances of the analyst’s own previous forecast of a firm. We also find that decisionfatigued analysts are more likely to issue a rounded forecast (one whose last digit is zero
6

or five), although owing to sample size, this finding is less robust. These results are
consistent with fatigued analysts switching to System 1 thinking, i.e., decisions that are
more non-reflective.
Finally, we study whether investors understand and discount for the lower
accuracy of forecasts issued when analysts are more fatigued. We do this by testing how
the sensitivity of cumulative abnormal returns to forecast revisions by the analyst varies
with the number of forecasts of other firms the analyst has already issued that day. We
find that the market understands the potential effect of decision fatigue on analyst
forecasts: The market reacts less strongly to analysts’ forecast revisions that are made
when the analysts are decision-fatigued.
In our tests of decision fatigue of analysts, we assume that fatigue increases with
the number of forecasts the analysts have already issued that day, and that the
forecasts are issued in the same order that they are being worked on during the day.
The first assumption is highly intuitive. The second is consistent with past evidence
that suggests that analysts work in a highly time-sensitive environment, which would
pressure analysts to issue forecasts as soon as they are finalized (O’Brien and Bhushan
1990; Hansen 2009; Altinkilic, Balashov, and Hansen 2010; Groysberg and Healy 2013).
It is possible that a forecast issued after other forecasts have been issued that
same day may actually have been developed earlier in the day (or week) before the
7

analyst became fatigued, or by other non-fatigued analyst team members. Any such
time lags between an analyst’s work and the issuance of her forecast biases against
obtaining non-null findings (i.e., that decision fatigue has no effect).
Yet another alternative explanation, one that we cannot rule out entirely, is that
analysts choose to structure their workday by first working on forecasts for which they
have high-quality information relative to the consensus. This would explain both the
higher accuracy of early forecasts and the lower tendency in such forecasts toward
herding or self-herding. However, it is not obvious why analysts would follow such a
work strategy. It may make sense for an analyst to prioritize making forecasts for firms
for which the analyst has better information. However, this could just as easily entail
making a well-informed forecast at the end of a workday or deferring the ill-informed
forecast for the start of the next workday. Nevertheless, to mitigate this concern, in our
robustness tests we remove all forecasts that follow an earnings announcement, and we
find that our results are similar, both qualitatively and quantitatively. This suggests
that our results are not driven by new public information about firms that is not
embedded in the consensus.
As contrasted with decision fatigue, physical fatigue might also influence the
ability or willingness of an analyst to exert effort and produce an accurate forecast. We
address this possibility by including the time of day as a control variable to proxy for
8

physical fatigue. Our main results also hold in subsamples that include only forecasts
that were issued before or after noon.
This paper draws from the literature on decision fatigue (e.g., Levav et al. 2010)
and analyst forecast accuracy and herding (e.g., Clement and Tse 2005) to examine
whether and how decision fatigue affects analyst forecast behavior and to examine the
resulting stock market implications (e.g., Givoly and Lakonishok 1979). Our study
contributes to three strands of literature. The first strand is the scant literature on
decision fatigue in professional settings, which we expand by showing that information
intermediaries are affected by decision fatigue. Second, we contribute to the literature
on analyst forecast accuracy and herding by showing that analyst forecasting behavior is
influenced by the number of forecasts she issued during the same day. Third, we provide
evidence about market efficiency by documenting that the market understands the effect
of decision fatigue on analyst forecasts.

2. Hypotheses
Extensive evidence from psychology indicates that judgments and decisions that
are made under greater pressure, distraction, or fatigue tend to be made more
heuristically. This can be described in the terminology of Kahneman (2011) as greater
use of System 1 thinking. Baumeister et al. (1998) propose that willpower is required to
maintain attentional focus for decision-making and, like muscle strength, willpower is
9

temporarily depleted by use. Self-control and judgment are impaired when available
psychic resources are low.
Several papers have documented the effects of decision fatigue on decisionmaking. In four laboratory studies, Vohs et al. (2008) find that participants who made
choices among consumer goods or college course options suffered from reduced selfcontrol (i.e., less physical stamina, reduced persistence in the face of failure, more
procrastination, and lower quality and quantity of arithmetic calculations). However,
others who thought about these same options without making choices did not suffer this
reduction in self-control. Augenblick and Nicholson (2015) conducted a field study and
found that voters who face more decisions before a given vote are significantly more
likely to abstain or to rely on decision shortcuts, such as voting for the status quo or
voting for the candidates who are listed first on the ballot. Similarly, Levav et al. (2010)
show that consumers who are purchasing a car are more likely to choose default levels of
attributes when they begin with attributes that offer a greater number of configuration
options than when they begin with attributes that offer a smaller number of options.
The psychology literature on ego depletion describes a limited mental resource
(ego) analogous to energy or strength, which is consumed by actions that require
application of self-control and/or decision-making. Effort consumes this limited resource
while using System 2 for decision-making.
10

A further question that arises in the literature is whether the observed decline in
performance after a session of decision-making (decision fatigue) stems from the
exhaustion of the limited resource or from a need to preserve the remaining stock of the
resource. 2 If decision fatigue stems from the exhaustion of the resource, then effort and
decision fatigue are exclusive concepts, and a decision fatigues analyst would not be able
to exert more effort to improve the quality of his work. If, however, decision fatigue
stems from the need to preserve a limited resource, then decision fatigue and effort are
not exclusive concepts, and a decision-fatigued analyst might be able to exert more
effort and improve the accuracy of his forecast if properly incentivized. Our paper is not
able to distinguish between these two possible sources of decision fatigue.
To our knowledge, the only paper to examine the effect of decision fatigue in a
professional setting is that of Danziger, Levav, and Avnaim-Pesso (2011). The authors
studied the proportion of parole requests approved by eight parole judges in Israel in
relation to the time since their last meal break. This proportion spikes after each meal,
when about 65% of requests are granted (relative to an average of 35%). During the
roughly two hours before the judges’ next meal, their approval rate drops steadily to
about zero just before the meal. It seems that tired and hungry judges tend to fall back
on the easier default position of denying requests for parole. This evidence does not,

(2016).

however, distinguish among decision fatigue, physical fatigue, and hunger as sources of
heuristic decision-making.
Previous studies of decision fatigue examine nonprofessionals who face a task
either for the first time or infrequently, and their level of motivation to perform well in
the task successfully is debatable. In contrast, professionals are experts in the task at
hand are highly motivated to perform well. There are reasons to believe ex-ante that
professionals might be less subject to decision fatigue. First, they might develop the
mental resources required to perform the task to a degree that the fatigue would not
play a role (like building a muscle; see Muraven and Baumeister 2000). Second, they
might develop a system of heuristics that leads to the right decision (“a sixth sense”, as
described by Kahneman 2011). Third, they or their firms might be aware of their
decision fatigue and implement a system of checks or supports to ensure that decision
quality does not drop. So whether professionals are subject to decision fatigue is an
interesting empirical question.
The equity analyst setting has some distinctive features that are especially wellsuited for testing the effects of decision fatigue. Different analysts will issue different
numbers of forecasts earlier in a given day; therefore, the presence of other analysts who
cover the same firm at the same time offers a counterfactual benchmark to the forecast
being evaluated. Unlike most professions, the outcome of an analyst’s decision can be
12

reliably measured: We can observe ex post how close the forecast was to the actual
result. Finally, analysts work in a highly time-sensitive environment. As such, it is likely
that most of their work is performed sequentially, forecast by forecast, with work on any
given forecast closely followed by the issuance of that forecast.
Several findings provide support for this interpretation. O’Brien and Bhushan
(1990) describe a customer–supplier relationship between financial institutions and
brokerage houses. To the extent that institutional investors demand timely information
to make trading decisions, financial analysts have incentives to provide prompt forecast
revisions to financial institution clients. The evidence in Hansen (2009) and in Altinkilic,
Balashov, and Hansen (2010) suggests that analysts release recommendations soon after
the release of new information that has a material effect on the stock price. Groysberg
and Healy (2013) report that analysts issue on average 12 notes to every one report, and
each note only requires a few hours to write. It is important to note that even if the
research is conducted by teams (i.e., associate analysts take part in the process of
analyzing a company), a bottleneck is still created by the senior analyst, who signs off
on the report and is responsible for communicating the report to the public. When the
senior analyst is fatigued and unable to invest the necessary mental resources to
reviewing the work done by the team, the senior analyst might resort to more heuristic
behavior.
13

Clement (1999) shows that factors such as analysts’ ability, available resources,
and portfolio complexity significantly influence forecast accuracy. For example, the
author shows that forecast accuracy increases with experience (a proxy for ability) and
with employer size (a proxy for available resources), and that accuracy decreases with
the number of firms followed (a proxy for portfolio complexity). We contribute to this
literature by testing how mental resources affect forecast accuracy, controlling for past
known determinants wherever possible. We predict that, with each additional forecast in
the sequence, the analyst becomes more fatigued. This fatigue causes the analyst to rely
more on System 1 thinking than System 2 thinking when making a decision that reduces
forecast accuracy. Accordingly, we hypothesize:

H1: An analyst’s relative forecast accuracy decreases with the number of forecasts
the analyst has made earlier in the day.

An analyst who is fatigued can resort to some natural heuristic procedures for
generating a forecast. One is to herd by issuing a forecast that is close to the consensus
forecast. This is a reasonable shortcut to follow when the analyst lacks the cognitive
resources to generate much incremental information relative to the consensus. This
hypothesis is new to the herding literature, which has focused primarily on information
14

transmission or agency problems. 3 We build on this literature by testing how analysts’
mental resources are also a determinant of herding behavior. This leads to our second
hypothesis:

H2: The likelihood that an analyst herds increases with the number of forecasts
the analyst has made during the day.

Another possible heuristic is to stick closely to the analyst’s previous outstanding
forecast about the firm. When decision fatigue prevents an analyst from generating
much useful new information, another reasonable shortcut is to rely more heavily on
previous analyses. In the extreme case, the analyst would self-herd by not updating the
previous forecast at all. This leads to our third hypothesis:

H3: The likelihood that an analyst reissues an outstanding previous forecast
increases with the number of forecasts the analyst has made during the day.

Welch (2000) documents herding behavior among analysts. Hong, Kubik, and Solomon (2000) show that
herding is economically rational given analysts’ career concerns: being wrong when everyone else is wrong
is preferable to being wrong when others are correct. Clement and Tse (2005) find that analyst
characteristics, especially those that reflect analyst forecast abilities, affect herding behavior.
3

15

Herrmann and Thomas (2005) provide evidence that rounded forecasts (forecasts
ending with zero or five) are less accurate than other forecasts. Dechow and You (2012)
show that rounded forecasts are more likely to indicate that the analyst is exerting less
effort. Decision-fatigued analysts may be tempted to provide a rounded forecast instead
of exerting the mental effort required to provide a more accurate estimate. This leads to
our fourth hypothesis:

H4: The likelihood that an analyst issues a rounded forecast increases with the
number of forecasts the analyst has made during the day.

Past research indicates that sell-side analysts’ forecast revisions are important for
investor expectations about firms’ earnings and for making investment decisions (e.g.,
Hodge 2003). This conclusion is supported by the substantial average stock market
reaction to the release of forecast revisions (e.g., Brown, Foster, and Noreen 1985;
Gonedes, Dopuch, and Penman 1976; Givoly and Lakonishok 1979). Furthermore, there
is evidence that market reactions to forecast revisions take into account past forecast
accuracy and other correlates of current forecast accuracy (e.g., Bonner, Walther, and
Young 2003; Clement and Tse 2003; Gleason and Lee 2003; Michaely and Womack
1999).
16

This literature suggests that if the market is efficient, it will take into account
the effects of decision fatigue on analyst forecast accuracy. For example, investors may
directly take into account the number of previous forecasts the analyst has issued during
the day. Alternatively, sophisticated investors understand that analyst herding occurs,
and they take this into account when evaluating forecasts. Decision-fatigued analysts
are more likely to offer forecasts that are similar to the consensus, and this may also
lead to more discounting of their forecasts. This leads to our fifth and final hypothesis:

H5: The more forecasts an analyst has issued earlier in the same day, the weaker
the reaction of investors when the analyst issues a forecast revision.

We discussed earlier the possibility that analysts intentionally issue their most
well-informed forecasts early in the workday. To consider this in more depth, suppose
that especially precise information signals arrive uniformly throughout the workday, and
that the analyst tends to work on a firm forecast whenever a precise signal about that
firm first arrives. If so, then precise forecasts will be distributed evenly throughout the
workday. Now, if we instead suppose that precise signals arrive only toward the end of
the workday (perhaps because these signals are the product of analyst effort during the
day), then the most precise forecasts will tend to be issued late in the day. This would
17

bias against finding the results we document, and it strengthens our inference from our
evidence that decision fatigue is a factor.
Another possible concern arises in a scenario in which analysts generate their
most precise signals overnight or over the weekend, and therefore they issue their most
precise forecasts at the start of the workday. We cannot rule out this possibility because
it would generate results similar to the implications of decision fatigue. For example,
firms often make voluntary disclosures outside of trading hours. This encourages the
revision of forecasts, which may occur at the start of the next day. However, this is by
no means always the case. Zhang (1998) documents that around half of analysts revise
their forecasts in the three days following an earnings announcement, so it is clear that
such revisions often occur later than the morning of the first day after the
announcement. Nevertheless, we perform robustness checks to ensure that our results
are not driven by morning revisions the day after earnings announcements.
Also, although morning forecast revisions are issued in response to news received
overnight or during the previous weekend, forecasts issued during the rest of the day are
also in response to the arrival of public information. So, although this news is
informative, the fact that morning forecast revisions make use of new information does
not imply that morning forecasts are more informative than forecasts made at other
times of the day.
18

3. Data and descriptive statistics
Data on analysts’ EPS forecasts were collected from the Institutional Brokers’
Estimate System (I/B/E/S) database over the period 2002–2015. 4 The starting year of
2002 was chosen because this was the first year that the announcement time of the
forecast was verified (Hoechle, Schaub, and Schmid 2012). Similar to prior literature
(e.g., Gleason and Lee 2003; Clement and Tse 2005; Kumar 2010), we focus on one-yearahead earnings forecasts.
The focus of this paper is on timely forecasts that are issued during the workday.
So, we focus on forecasts that were prepared or at least partially prepared during a
single day and were released on that day in sequence. Accordingly, we limit our sample
to days when the analyst only issued forecasts between the working hours of 9:00 a.m.
and 7:00 p.m. 5 Each forecast issued during the day is marked as a decision by the order
in which it was issued.
Table 1 shows the number of analyst’s decisions in our sample and the partition
between the number of forecasts in a day. On average, analysts make 1.3 forecasts per
day (on days when forecasts are issued), and our sample consists of 386,924 total
forecasts. On most of the analyst–days in the sample (255,613), the analyst only made
one forecast. On 27,975 analyst–days, the analyst made two forecasts, resulting in
Following previous literature, we exclude utilities and financial services firms (SIC codes 4900-4999 and
6000-6999).

Changing the length of the workday provides qualitatively similar results.

55,950 forecasts; the number of analyst–days that have a larger number of forecasts
continues to decrease with the number of forecasts.
Our main dependent variables of interest are ACCURACY, HERDING,

REISSUE, and ROUNDING. Following prior research, we compare the accuracy of an
analyst’s one-year-ahead EPS forecasts for a particular company at a given time to the
mean level of accuracy for all analysts who make forecasts for the same company and
time period within a comparable forecast horizon (Jacob, Lys, and Neale 1999; Clement
1999; Hong and Kubik 2003; Cowen, Groysberg, and Healey 2006). This controls for any
firm- or time-specific factors that affect forecast accuracy. We therefore define

analysts who cover firm j within the same 90 days. The denominator standardizes across
firms by dividing by the standard deviation of EPS forecast errors across all analysts
who cover firm j at time t.

Following Clement and Tse (2005), we define 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 as a binary variable

that receives the value of 1 if analyst i’s forecast of company j at time t is between the

20

consensus forecast at time t and the analyst’s own previous forecast, and 0 otherwise.
(All other variables are defined in Appendix A.)
We also estimate a new measure, 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 , which is a dummy variable that

takes the value of 1 if a forecast is reissued (self-herding), and 0 otherwise. When an

analyst reissues a forecast, I/B/E/S does not create a new record in its dataset. Instead,
I/B/E/S collects information on the date (REVDATS) and time (REVTIMS) the
analyst reissued the outstanding forecast. 6 We use this date and time to ascertain when
a forecast was reissued.
Following Dechow and You (2012), we define 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 as a dummy

variable that takes the value of 1 if a forecast ends with zero or five in the penny digit,
and 0 otherwise.
Table 2 shows descriptive statistics by number of forecasts made by the analyst
for the given day. As expected, ACCURACY declines and HERDING increases as the
analyst makes more forecasts throughout the day. ROUNDING is relatively stable and
has no clear pattern. The size of the brokerage house and the forecast age (the number
of firms the analyst follows) are decreasing (increasing) with each sequential decision.
The analyst’s experience with the firm and the level of effort invested in a firm do not
If an analyst’s report does not contain a revision to the forecast, then I/B/E/S does not keep that
forecast as a separate record. It retains the original record for that forecast, but updates the review date
(REVDATS) and time (REVTIME) for the forecast to make it current. If the forecast is changed, only
then does I/B/E/S enter a new record in its database but with a new announcement date (ANNDATS).

seem to follow any specific pattern. The type of firm seems to be related to the decision
order as well. Firms that are forecasted earlier in the day tend to be smaller, followed
by fewer analysts, have lower ROA, higher sales growth, higher R&D, higher fraction of
intangible assets, and a lower earnings-to-price ratio.
One possible reason for this phenomenon is that analysts try to first issue
forecasts for firms for which the forecasting problem is more complex, or for which the
information environment is sparser. This may be valuable to investors who want to
trade during the day and who will have the most trouble evaluating such firms until the
analyst provides a new and timelier forecast. Alternatively, an analyst may recognize
that she will be fatigued later in the day, and therefore try to complete the most
challenging tasks much earlier in the day when she is not fatigued. 7

4. Results
4.1 Accuracy
To assess whether analysts’ forecast accuracy decreases as a function of the
number of earlier forecasts they have made during the day, we estimate the following
regression model:
𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 ( 1 )
If this is occurring, and to the extent that our controls for determinants of decision accuracy are
imperfect, it would tend to cause us to find that earlier forecasts are less accurate than later forecasts. It
would therefore bias against the results that we actually find.
7

22

Where our key independent variable 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 is the logarithm of the

number of forecasts an analyst has issued before the focal forecast plus one. 8 Our

controls for other determinants of analysts’ relative accuracy include the number of
companies covered by the analyst, the brokerage house size, the analyst’s firm-specific
experience, the age of the forecast, the forecast frequency, and the number of analysts
who cover the firm. Finally, we control for the time of day being a measure of physical
fatigue rather than decision fatigue.
To test our hypotheses, we estimate Model 1 using three different specifications.
The first specification excludes analyst fixed effects. It estimates whether the accuracy
of a forecast deteriorates, on average, as a function of the number of forecasts an analyst
has previously issued during the day under the implicit assumption that analyst
accuracy is ex ante identical across analysts. The second model includes analyst fixed
effects to control for analyst differences in accuracy. Thus, the model examines whether
on average for a given analyst, the accuracy of the forecast deteriorates as a function of
the number of forecasts the analyst has previously issued during the day. Finally, we
include in the model analyst–day fixed effects, which compare whether for a given
analyst–day the accuracy of the forecast deteriorates as a function of the number of

8

We winsorize the variable at 5. Results are robust to not winsorizing.

23

forecasts the analyst has previously issued during that day, which controls for the fact
that accuracy may be greater on some days than on others.
The results presented in Table 3, Columns 1 and 2, indicate that on average the
accuracy of the forecast deteriorates as a function of the number of forecasts the analyst
has previously issued during the day. In Column 2, the coefficient on our key
independent variable, DECISION RANK, is −0.225 and is significant at the 1% level.
This suggests that on average a one-unit increase in DECISION RANK leads to a
forecast that is 0.225 standard deviations less accurate relative to the consensus. This is
an economically meaningful effect.
Columns 3 and 4 indicate that, for a given analyst, the accuracy of the forecast
deteriorates as a function of the number of forecasts the analyst has previously issued
during the day. In Column 4, the coefficient on our variable of interest, DECISION

RANK, is −0.169 and is significant at the 1% level. This suggests that on average a
one-unit increase in DECISION RANK leads to a forecast that is 0.169 standard
deviations less accurate relative to the consensus for the same analyst, regardless of
what day or for what type of firm the forecasts were issued.
H1 is formally tested in Columns 5 and 6. By adding analyst–day fixed effects to
the regression specification, we test whether for a given analyst–day the accuracy of the
forecast deteriorates as a function of the number of forecasts the analyst has previously
24

issued during that day. In Column 6, the coefficient on our variable of interest,

DECISION RANK, is −0.067, significant at the 5% level. This implies that on average a
one-unit increase in DECISION RANK leads to a forecast that is 0.067 standard
deviations less accurate relative to the consensus for the same analyst and the same day.
A different way to interpret the economic magnitude is by examining Table 2. The
average accuracy decreases from the first forecast to the second forecast by 0.089, which
is equivalent to a decrease of 18.5%.
The results in this section suggest that forecast N is on average more accurate
than forecast N + 1 and suggests that the quality of decisions deteriorates as a function
of the number of previous decisions the analyst has made during that day. This is true
for our three test specifications. First, analyst i’s forecast N is more accurate than
analyst j’s forecast N + 1. Second, analyst i’s forecast N is more accurate than the
forecast N + 1 on a different day. Third and most importantly, analyst i’s forecast N is
more accurate than forecast N + 1, which was issued on the same day. All of these
comparisons hold constant across firms, and therefore the results are independent of
firm characteristics.
4.2 Herding
We now turn to the question of whether analysts who are more decision fatigued
resort more to heuristic decision-making. We therefore test whether analysts are more
25

likely to issue a herding forecast as a function of the number of forecasts the analyst has
previously issued during the day. We use the following logistic regression:
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃�𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 � = 𝑓𝑓�𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 � ( 2 )

Table 4 summarizes the relationship between herding and decision fatigue. We

present two regression specifications (logit and fixed effects logit). Both specifications
include our set of controls from Model 1. Columns 1 to 6 indicate that an analyst’s
issuance of a herding forecast is positively associated with the number of earlier sameday forecasts made by the analyst. This is true for all analysts on average (Columns 1
and 2) and for an analyst who covers a specific firm (Columns 3 and 4).
To formally test H2, we use the conditional form of the logit regression and
control for analyst–day FE. 9 The results are presented in Columns 5 and 6. Consistent
with the hypothesis, within a specific analyst–day, the analyst is more likely to herd
with each sequential decision. The coefficient is equal to 0.086, significant at the 5%
level. The marginal effect at the mean is 0.02, meaning that a one standard deviation
increase in DECISION RANK corresponds to a 0.7% increase in the probability of
herding. A different way to interpret the economic magnitude is by examining Table 2.

We use conditional logit in order to estimate the fixed effects model consistently. By conditioning the
likelihood on the number of successes in each panel, we avoid estimating the coefficients of the fixed
effects themselves. As a result, this procedure produces consistent estimates of the remaining coefficients.

9

26

The probability of herding increases from the first forecast to the second forecast by
0.023, which is equivalent to an increase of 8.27%.
4.3 Reissued forecasts
Another possible heuristic is that the analyst would self-herd by not updating the
previous forecast at all. We therefore test whether analysts are more likely to reissue an
outstanding forecast as a function of the number of forecasts the analyst has previously
issued during the day. We use the following logistic regression:
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃�𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 � = 𝑓𝑓�𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 �

(3)

The results are reported in Table 5. Consistent with the hypothesis, the

coefficient of DECISION RANK is positive and significant across all specifications. H4 is
formally tested in Columns 5 and 6. The results suggest that within a specific analyst–
day, the more forecasts the analyst has issued previously during the same day, the more
likely the analyst is to self-herd by reissuing an outstanding previous forecast. The
marginal effect at the mean is 0.262, meaning that a one standard deviation increase in

DECISION_RANK corresponds to an 8.2% increase in probability of reissuing the same
forecast within a given analyst day. A different way to interpret the economic
magnitude is by examining Table 2. The results show that the probability of reissuing
the same forecast increases from the first forecast to the second forecast by 0.064, which
is equivalent to an increase of 11.1%.
27

4.4 Rounding
As decision fatigue increases, the analyst might be tempted to be heuristic in
other ways as well. One example is providing a rounded estimate instead of devoting the
additional mental effort required for a more accurate estimate. We therefore test
whether analysts are more likely to provide a rounded forecast as a function of the
number of forecasts the analyst has previously issued during the day. We use the
logistic regression:
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃�𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 � = 𝑓𝑓�𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑅𝑅𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 �

(3)

We split the sample into earning forecast below $1, and forecasts in the range of

$1 to $10. (There are less than 60 cases with earnings forecasts above $10.) Consistent
with Dechow and You (2012), we find no effect when the level of earnings forecast is
below $1, probably since rounding the penny digit would lead to considerable forecast
inaccuracy for such stocks. In other words, even an analyst who is behaving heuristically
is unlikely to make such an extremely crude estimate.
The remaining sample of earning forecasts between $1 and $10 is considerably
smaller than for our main sample, reducing statistical power. The results for this sample
are in Table 6. The coefficient of DECISION RANK is generally positive and increases
in both magnitude and significance as we improve the model specification to include
controls and analyst-day fixed effects. H4 is formally tested in Column 6.
28

These results suggest that within a specific analyst–day, the more forecasts the
analyst has issued previously during the same day, the more likely the analyst is to
provide a rounded forecast. The marginal effect at the mean is 0.033, so that a one
standard deviation increase in DECISION_RANK corresponds to a 0.7% increase in
probability of rounding the forecast in a given analyst-day. The economic magnitude
can also be estimated using Table 2, which shows that the probability of rounding a
forecast increases from the first forecast to the second forecast by 0.003, an increase of
1%.
4.5 Market Reaction
To examine whether investors react differently to forecast revisions issued by
analysts as a function of the number of earlier forecasts they have made during the day,
we estimate the following regression:
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡

+ 𝛽𝛽3 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 ∗ 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽4 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶
+ 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡

(4)

where 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 is the 3-day market-adjusted excess return for firm j centered on the

forecast revision issued by analyst i at time t. The variable 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 is a
measure of the difference between the current annual earnings forecast for analyst i
following firm j at time t and the annual earnings forecast issued immediately before the
29

current annual earnings forecast, scaled by the standard deviation of forecasts of all
analysts who cover firm j at time t.
To calculate the forecast revision, we require that the analyst issue both a
current and a prior annual earnings forecast for the same firm and year. We choose the
analyst’s prior forecast to calculate the forecast revision, because it is more informative
to the market than the consensus forecast (Gleason and Lee 2003; Stickel 1991).
Table 7 reports the results from estimating Equation (3). As expected, the
estimated coefficient on FORECAST REVISION is positive and statistically significant
regardless of the specification used, which indicates that the market reaction to the
release of the revised forecast is associated with the signed magnitude of the forecast
revision. Consistent with Hypothesis 3, the estimated coefficient on FORECAST

REVISION∗DECISION RANK is negative and statistically significant in all
specifications. The coefficient on our variable of interest ranges from −0.007 without
control variables and fixed effects to −0.001 when including all control variables and
analyst–day fixed effects. The economic significance seems large; for example, in Column
5, the coefficient of FORECAST REVISION∗DECISION RANK is −0.002, and it is
equal to 20% of the coefficient of FORECAST REVISION.
This finding indicates that the market reacts less strongly the more prior
forecasts the analyst has made during the day. This result is compatible with the results
30

in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 that analysts are less accurate and are more likely to herd the
more prior forecasts they have made during the day. The market seems to understand
these relationships and reacts accordingly. 10
4.6 Alternative Explanations, Robustness, and Additional Tests
Our tests are based on the ordering of forecasts exogenously inducing variation
in decision fatigue. However, the ordering might not be random; analysts may rank
firms and prioritize some over others for earlier forecasts. This might induce variation in
the accuracy of forecasts in relation to rank for reasons other than decision fatigue. Of
course, a non-random ranking rule is not in itself inconsistent with decision fatigue. But
we now consider whether such prioritization affects the inferences from our tests.
We explore two types of potential ranking rules:
1. A ranking rule with a constant firm ordering, meaning that some specific firm A
always ranked ahead of firm B for forecasts by a specific analyst. In other words,
if information about the two firms arrives at about the same time, the analyst
issues a forecast for firm A before firm B. Examples for such ranking rules
include starting with firms which are more (or less) complex, firms that have

There are rational settings in which herding or cascading is a rational means of exploiting the
information possessed by earlier decision-makers Banerjee, 1992; Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, and Welch,
1992). However, irrational herding as induced, for example, by decision fatigue, will tend to reduce the
quality of decisions.
10

31

relationships with the analysts’ employer, firms that are more important to
investors, or firms in which the analyst specializes.
For the sake of specificity, we consider first ranking more important firms higher.
Crucially, analysts issuing forecasts of more important firms earlier in time does

not imply that they will issue such forecasts earlier in the day. To see this,
suppose, for example, that there was no decision fatigue, and that as new
information arrived, analysts issued timelier forecasts for more important firms.
This would in some cases push a forecast earlier in the day, if news arrived early
in the day. But in other cases, it would push forecasts to late in the day if news
arrived late in the day, instead of deferring to early the next day. Overall,
prioritization of more important firms has no obvious implication for whether
important firms on average receive updates earlier or later in the day.
Consider now the case in which there is decision fatigue, and analysts understand
this. In this case, there is a reason for analysts to push more important firms to
earlier in the day (perhaps even by deferring the update for an important firm
from late in the day to early the next day). However, this argument is premised
on the idea that there is decision fatigue. So, this argument does not seem to
provide a counterargument to the conclusion of the paper that there is decision
fatigue.
32

Nevertheless, to verify robustness, we explicitly tested if analysts follow a
constant decision rule and found close to zero autocorrelation coefficient for a
given analyst-firm pair. 11
Also, our relative accuracy measure, which compares the accuracy for a
particular company and time period to the median accuracy for all analysts who
make forecasts for the same company and time period within a comparable
forecast horizon, mitigates any firm characteristic effects (Jacob et al., 1999;
Clement, 1999; Hong and Kubik, 2003; and Cowen et al., 2006). Nevertheless, for
robustness, we repeat our main analysis with analyst-firm-year fixed effects.
Results are summarized in Table 8. The results for the effects of decision fatigue
on the accuracy, herding, and reissuance are robust to the inclusion of analystfirm-year fixed effects. The coefficient of DECISION RANK in the rounding
regression (column 4) is positive but not significant, but this is not surprising
given the smaller sample size and resulting lower power of this test. So, our
results are robust to non-random ranking caused by firm and analyst
characteristics.

We tested the autocorrelation coefficient using a sample which includes only days in which an analyst
made two forecasts. We regress DECISION RANK on lagged DECISION RANK, including analyst and
firm fixed effects. The autocorrelation coefficient is -0.006 with a t-statistic of -0.88.
11

33

2. A ranking rule with a non-constant firm ordering. In such a rule, an analyst
follows some state variable which determines whether firm A is ranked before
firm B. For example, an analyst might order his forecast based on when new
information about each firm arrives.
To implement this, we perform tests based on the state variable being the timing
of information arrival. We find that our results are robust to excluding forecasts
that are made in the early morning, pre-noon, and post-noon.
We also repeat our main analysis omitting all forecasts in which firms announce
earnings in the preceding day (possibly outside of trading hours). If analysts
preferentially issue forecasts earlier in the day for firms that announced earnings
on the preceding day, then the results might be driven by the increase in
accuracy deriving from use of the new public signal that was not yet embedded in
the consensus. In Table 9, we find that the results are basically unaffected by
omitting the forecasts made following the day of an earnings announcement of a
firm. 12 The inferences are identical, and the magnitudes of the coefficients are
very similar.
Since all analysts can observe public information when it arrives, the timing of
the arrival of public information does not explain the relative forecast accuracy
The results are also similar when removing forecasts that are made within three and five days after the
earnings announcement.
12

34

across analysts. Private information can arrive at different times of the day
across analysts. However, Reg FD prohibits managers from providing private
information to analysts. Given this, we view it as especially unlikely for an
analyst to be able consistently to generate private information (for example, by
developing relationships with multiple investor relations officers) about different
firms and for that information to arrive systematically at the beginning of the
day for all those firms.
Since we do not have an experiment with a random assignment of forecast
ordering for the analysts, we cannot fully rule out all alternative explanations. However,
alternative explanations are relatively implausible. A viable alternative explanation
must provide both a ranking rule that is neither firm- nor analyst-specific and explain
the decline in decision quality relative to self and to peers as the rank increases (later
forecast).
In addition to our main results, we also tested the effect of decision fatigue
among analysts during earning announcements season. During earning season, analysts
are overloaded with information, so it might seem plausible that decision fatigue effects
might be stronger. The higher workload is likely to reduce the amount of time and
attention that an analyst devotes to each forecast. However, it is less obvious whether it
predicts a stronger decline in accuracy throughout the day.
35

We repeat all the tests for days following earning announcements (intervals from
the day of the forecast to 5 days). In all specifications, we obtain results similar to those
for the non-post announcements day sample. A statistical test indicates no significant
differences between the two samples.
We also tested if there are cross-sectional differences in the impact of decision
fatigue across analysts or across forecasts based on factors that might influence the
difficulty of forecasting. We find no cross-sectional difference in decision fatigue based
upon the brokerage house size, the experience of the analysts, the existence of managers’
guidance, the quality of managers’ guidance, or the analysts’ company’s specific
experience. Again, it is plausible that these factors would predict overall level of forecast
accuracy or the probability of using heuristics, but not necessarily a greater rate of
decline in performance throughout the day.

5. Conclusion
We investigate whether decision fatigue is systematically associated with the
forecasting behavior of sell-side security analysts’ annual EPS forecasts. Our results
suggest that analysts become decision-fatigued during the day, which is consistent with
views of cognitive processing developed by Baumeister (1998) and Kahneman (2011).
When mental resources are high, analysts use System 2 thinking and make wellreasoned decisions. However, when mental resources are low, analysts begin to use
36

System 1 thinking and make more intuitive, heuristic decisions. Our archival data test
design helps address the potential irreproducibility problems that plague laboratory
experiments that are most commonly employed to study ego depletion. We provide a
distinct form of evidence about the negative consequences of decision fatigue as
predicted in the psychology literature.
Specifically, we use the number of forecasts an analyst has issued earlier in the
same day as a proxy for decision fatigue, and we find that analysts become less accurate
as they become more decision-fatigued. We also find that analysts become more
heuristic in their forecasting strategies as they become more decision-fatigued; they are
more likely to herd toward the consensus forecast, to self-herd by reissuing their own
previous outstanding forecast, and to issue a forecast that is rounded to end with a 0 or
5. Finally, we test how the market reacts to these forecasts in relation to the extent that
decision fatigue affected the development of the forecast. We find that the stock
market’s reaction to a forecast revision is weaker when the issuing analyst is more
decision-fatigued.
We can rule out several alternative explanations. First, by controlling for the
time of day, we can be confident that we are examining decision fatigue rather than
physical fatigue. Second, our difference-in-difference design mitigates firm characteristic
effects and focuses instead on the variation in the degree of decision fatigue across
37

analysts in our tests. Third, by removing forecasts that follow earnings announcements,
we mitigate the concern that our results are driven by new information.
Most behavioral accounting research focuses on cognitive constraints or illusions
that are implicitly assumed to be constant for any given individual. For example,
empirical findings are often interpreted in terms of some assumed traits of an investor
such as limited attention, overconfidence, or loss aversion. Often (though not uniformly)
behavioral models assume that these investor traits are static. Our findings differ by
focusing on how the judgment of economic decision-makers varies as a function of past
actions. In our study, the past actions are the decisions made earlier in the day that
result in decision fatigue. Our evidence suggests that there may be other important
managerial and capital market contexts in which the decision-maker’s performance
varies over time in predictable ways that depend on the decision-maker’s cognitive
resources and past decisions.

The dependent variable is as follows: 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑈𝑈𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 is analyst i’s EPS forecast error of
company j at day t. This EPS forecast error is compared to the median EPS forecast error for all
analysts issuing EPS forecast error for company j up until day t (consensus). The relative accuracy is
standardized across firms by deflating the standard deviation of EPS forecasts error across all analysts
who cover the firm. The independent variables are as follows: DECISION RANK is the log value of the
number of forecasts an analyst has made before the forecast being evaluated, plus 1. Definitions of the
control variables are provided in Appendix A. t-statistics are provided in parentheses with
heteroskedastic-consistent standard errors clustered at the analyst level. *, **, and *** indicate
statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

The dependent variable 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 is the 3-day market-adjusted excess return for firm j centered on the
forecast revision issued by analyst i at time t. The independent variables are as follows: DECISION
RANK is the log value of the number of forecasts an analyst has made before the forecast being
evaluated, plus 1. FORECAST REVISION is a measure of the difference between the current annual
earnings forecast for analyst i who follows firm j in time t and the annual earnings forecast issued
immediately before current annual earnings forecast, scaled by the standard deviation of forecasts of all
analysts who cover firm j in time t. Definitions of the control variables are provided in Appendix A. tstatistics are provided in parentheses with heteroskedastic-consistent standard errors clustered at the
analyst level. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

The sample used in this Table does not include forecasts that are made following the day after an
earnings announcement of a firm. The dependent variables are as follows: 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 is
analyst i’s EPS forecast error of company j at day t. This EPS forecast error is compared to the median
EPS forecast error for all analysts issuing EPS forecast error for company j up until day t (consensus).
The relative accuracy is standardized across firms by deflating the standard deviation of EPS forecasts
error across all analysts who cover the firm. 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 is a binary variable with a value of 1 if
analyst i’s forecast of company j at time t is between the consensus forecast at time t and her own
previous forecast, and 0 otherwise. 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 , is a binary variable with a value of 1 if analyst i’s
forecast of company j at time t is the reissuance of her own previous forecast, and 0 otherwise. The
independent variables are as follows: DECISION RANK is the log value of the number of forecasts an
analyst has made before the forecast being evaluated, plus 1. Definitions of the control variables are
provided in Appendix A. t-statistics (z-statistics) are provided in parentheses with heteroskedasticconsistent standard errors clustered at the analyst level. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at
the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Appendix A
Variable Name

Description

ADVERTISING

Log value of advertising expense plus 1.

BROKER SIZE

A measure of the size of analyst i’s brokerage house. It is calculated as
the number of analysts employed by the brokerage that employs analyst
i following firm j in year t minus the minimum number of analysts
employed by brokerages for analysts who follow firm j in year t, with
this difference scaled by the range of brokerage house sizes for analysts
who follow firm j in year t.

CAR

The 3-day market-adjusted excess return for firm j centered on the
forecast revision issued by analyst i at time t.

CFF

Cash flows from financing at year t deflated by the absolute value of
operating cash flows at year t.

DECISION RANK

The log value of the number of forecasts an analyst has made before the
forecast being evaluated, plus 1.

E/P

Earnings per share (basic) at the end of year t deflated by price per
share at the end of year t.

EFFORT

A measure of analyst i’s effort in forecasting firm j. It is calculated as
the number of forecasts issued by analyst i following firm j in year t
minus the minimum number of forecasts issued by analysts who follow
firm j in year t, with this difference scaled by the range of forecasts
issued by analysts who follow firm j in year t.

FIRM EXPERIENCE

A measure of analyst i’s firm-specific experience. It is calculated as the
number of years of firm-specific experience for analyst i following firm j
in year t minus the minimum number of years of firm-specific experience
for analysts who follow firm j in year t, with this difference scaled by the
range of years of firm-specific experience for analysts who follow firm j
in year t.

FIRMS FOLLOWED

A measure of the number of companies that analyst i follows in year t.
It is calculated as the number of companies followed by analyst i
following firm j in year t minus the minimum number of companies
followed by analysts who follow firm j in year t, with this difference
scaled by the range in the number of companies followed by the analysts
who follow firm j in year t.
53

FORECAST AGE

A measure of the time from the forecast date to the earnings
announcement. It is calculated as the number of days from the forecast
date to the date of the earnings announcement for analyst i in year t
minus the minimum number of days from the forecast date to the date
of the earnings announcement for analysts who follow firm j in year t,
with this difference scaled by the range of days from the forecast date to
the date of the earnings announcement for analysts who follow firm j in
year t.

FORECAST REVISION

A measure of the difference between the current annual earnings forecast
for analyst i following firm j in time t and the annual earnings forecast
issued immediately before the current annual earnings forecast, scaled by
the standard deviation of forecasts of all analysts who cover firm j in
time t.

HERDING

A dummy variable that receives the value of 1 for forecasts that are
between the analyst’s own prior forecast and the consensus forecast, and
0 otherwise.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Intangible assets at the end of the fiscal year deflated by total assets at
the end of the fiscal year.

MVE

Price per share at the end of the fiscal year multiplied by number of
shares at the end of the fiscal year.

NUMEST

The number of analysts who cover firm j at time t.

R&D

A dummy variable that receives the value of one if the firm has an R&D
expense at the end of the year and zero otherwise.

REISSUE

A dummy variable that takes the value of one if a forecast is reissued
(self-herding) and zero otherwise.

RELATIVE
ACCURACY

A measure of analyst i’s EPS forecast error for company j at time t
subtracted from the median EPS forecast error for all analysts who
cover firm j within the same 90 days. This difference is standardized
across firms by dividing it by the standard deviation of EPS forecast
errors across all analysts who cover firm j at time t.

ROA

Income before extraordinary items deflated by total assets at the end of
the fiscal year.

SALES GROWTH

The value of (sales in fiscal year t – sales in fiscal year t - 1), deflated by
sales in fiscal year t - 1.

54

STD RET

Standard deviation of monthly returns in year t.

TIME OF DAY

An ordinal measure that receives the value of 1 for the first hour of the
workday (9:00 a.m.), the value of 2 for the second hour of the workday
(10:00 a.m.), and so on.

VOLUME

The mean monthly share volume for year t deflated by market value of
equity.
