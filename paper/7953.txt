1 Introduction
It is a truism that monetary policy operates under considerable uncertainty about the state
of the economy and the size and nature of the disturbances that hit the economy. This is a
particular problem for a procedure such as in‡ation-forecast targeting, under which a central
bank, in order to set its interest-rate instrument, needs to construct conditional forecasts of
future in‡ation, conditional on alternative interest-rate paths and the bank’s best estimate of
the current state of the economy and the likely future development of important exogenous
variables.1 Often, di¤erent indicators provide con‡icting information on developments in the
economy. In order to be successful, a central bank then needs to put the appropriate weights on
di¤erent information and draw the most e¢cient inference. In the case of a purely backwardlooking model (both of the evolution of the bank’s target variables and of the indicators), the
principles for e¢cient estimation and signal extraction are well known. But in the more realistic
case where important indicator variables are forward-looking variables, the problem of e¢cient
signal-extraction is inherently more complicated. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the
principles for determining the optimal weights on di¤erent indicators in such an environment.
In the case where there are no forward-looking variables, it is well known that a linear
model with a quadratic loss function and a partially observable state of the economy (partial
information) is characterized by certainty-equivalence. That is, the optimal policy is the same as
if the state of the economy were fully observable (full information), except that one responds to an
e¢cient estimate of the state vector rather than to its actual value. Thus, a separation principle
applies, according to which the selection of the optimal policy (the optimization problem) and the
estimation of the current state of the economy (the estimation or signal-extraction problem) can
be treated as separate problems. In particular, the observable variables will be predetermined
and the innovations in the observable variables (the di¤erence between the current realization
and previous prediction of each of the observable variables) contain all new information. The
optimal weights to be placed on the innovations in the various observable variables in one’s
estimate of the state vector at each point in time are provided by a standard Kalman …lter (see,
for instance, Chow [3], Kalchenbrenner and Tinsley [14] and LeRoy and Waud [16]).2
The case without forward-looking variables is, however, very restrictive. In the real world,

the output gap in purely backward-looking frameworks. Since the …rst version of this paper was written, Swanson
[39] has examined the monetary-policy consequences of output-gap uncertainty in a backward-looking model.

many important indicator variables for central banks are forward-looking variables, variables
that depend on private-sector expectations of the future developments in the economy and
future policy. Central banks routinely watch variables that are inherently forward-looking, like
exchange rates, bond rates and other asset prices, as well as measures of private-sector in‡ation
expectations, industry order-‡ows, con…dence measures, and the like. Forward-looking variables
complicate the estimation or signal-extraction problem signi…cantly. They depend, by de…nition,
on private-sector expectations of future endogenous variables and of current and future policy
actions. However, these expectations in turn depend on an estimate of the current state of the
economy, and that estimate in turn depends, to some extent, on observations of the current
forward-looking variables. This circularity presents a considerable challenge for the estimation
problem in the presence of forward-looking variables.
It is well known that forward-looking variables also complicate the optimization problem.
For example, optimal policy under commitment ceases in general to coincide with the outcome of
discretionary optimization, as demonstrated for the general linear model with quadratic objectives in Backus and Dri¢ll [2] and Currie and Levine [6]. With regard to the estimation problem,
Pearlman, Currie and Levin [21] showed in a linear (non-optimizing) model with forward-looking
variables and partial symmetric information that the solution can be expressed in terms of a
Kalman …lter, although the solution is much more complex than in the purely backward-looking
case. Pearlman [20] later used this solution in an optimizing model to demonstrate that certaintyequivalence, and hence the separation principle, applies under both discretion and commitment,
in the presence of forward-looking variables and symmetric partial information.
The present paper extends this previous work on partial information with forward-looking
variables by providing simpler derivations of the optimal weights on the observable variables, and
clarifying how the updating equations can be modi…ed to handle the circularity mentioned above.
We also provide a simple example, in a now-standard model of monetary policy with a forwardlooking aggregate supply relation and a forward-looking “expectational IS” relation. We believe
this example clari…es several issues raised by Orphanides [17]. He argues, for instance, with
reference to real-time U.S. data from the 1970s, that it is better that monetary policy disregards
uncertain data about the output gap and responds to current in‡ation only. Our …ndings are
di¤erent and in line with the conventional wisdom. First, we …nd that the monetary-policy
response to the optimal estimates of the current output gap is the same as under certainty, that
is, that certainty-equivalence applies. Second, the optimal weights put on the noisy observations,

2

the indicators, used in constructing the optimal estimate of the output gap depends on the degree
of uncertainty. For instance, when the degree of noise in an indicator of potential output is large,
the optimal weight on that indicator becomes small.3
Section 2 presents a relatively general linear model of an aggregate private sector and a
policy-maker, called the central bank, with a quadratic loss function. It then characterizes
optimizing policy under discretion, demonstrates certainty-equivalence, and derives the corresponding updating equation in the Kalman …lter for the estimation problem. Section 3 does the
same for the optimal policy with commitment.4 Throughout the paper, we maintain the assumption of symmetric information between the private-sector and the central bank; the asymmetric
case (for which certainty-equivalence does not hold) is treated in Svensson and Woodford [37].
Section 4 discusses the interpretation of the Kalman …lter. It shows how the Kalman …lter
can be modi…ed to handle the simultaneity and circularity referred to above, and that the
current estimate of the state of the economy can be expressed as a distributed lag of current
and past observable variables, with the Kalman gain matrix providing the optimal weights on
the observable variables. Section 5 presents an example of optimal monetary policy in a simple
forward-looking model, where in‡ation is forward-looking and depends on expectations of future
in‡ation, on a partially observable output gap (the di¤erence between observable output and
a partially unobservable potential output), and on an unobservable “cost-push” shock. Since
the observable rate of in‡ation both a¤ects and depends on the current estimates of potential
output and the cost-push shock, this example illustrates the gist of the estimation problem with
forward-looking variables. Finally, section 6 presents some conclusions, while appendices A–E
report some technical details.
3
Since the …rst version of this paper was written, we have received papers by Lansing [15] and Tetlow [40]
which consider the consequences of partial observability of potential output for monetary policy in forward-looking
models. Lansing considers learning about a shift in trend output. Tetlow examines the performance of alternative
simple instrument rules. He uses a Kalman …lter for the estimation of potential output, as we do, but as far as
we can see without considering the complications for such estimation caused by the existence of forward-looking
variables.
4
The demonstration of certainty-equivalence under commitment raises some special di¢culties which are
treated in a separate paper, Svensson and Woodford [38].

(2.5)

where ± (0 < ± < 1) is a discount factor (to be introduced below). This incorporates the case
when some or all of the predetermined and forward-looking variables are observable.5
5

Note that the predetermined and forward-looking variables can be interpreted as deviations from unconditional means and the target variables can be interpreted as deviations from constant target levels. More generally,
constants, non-zero unconditional means and non-zero target levels can be incorporated by including unity among
the predetermined variables, for instance, as the last element of Xt . The last row of the relevant matrices will
then include the corresponding constants/means/target levels.

Note that (2.1) assumes that the expectations xt+1jt in the second block of equations are
conditional on the information It . This corresponds to the case when the private sector and the
central bank has the same information It , so information is assumed to be symmetric. The case of
asymmetric information when these expectations are replaced by a private sector expectations
E[xt+1 jItp ] where the private-sector information Itp di¤ers from It is treated in Svensson and
Woodford [37].
Assume …rst that there is no commitment mechanism, so the central bank acts under discretion. Assume that central bank each period, conditional on the information It , minimizes the
expected discounted current and future values of the intertemporal loss function,

(2.6)

As shown in Pearlman [20] and in appendix A, certainty-equivalence applies when the central
bank and the private sector has the same information. Certainty-equivalence means that the
estimation of the partially observed state of the economy can be separated from the optimization,
the setting of the instrument so as to minimize the intertemporal loss function.
The equilibrium under discretion will be characterized by the instrument being a linear
function of the current estimate of the predetermined variables,

and we assume that the matrix A22 ¡ EGA

~ W and ±, but (corresponding to the certainty-equivalence referred
A, B, C ´ C 1 + C 2 , Ci , E,
to above) not on D1 , D2 , §uu and §vv .

5

Now, the lower block of (2.1) implies
A121 (Xt ¡ Xtjt ) + A122 (xt ¡ xtjt ) = 0:

(2.11)

Combining this with (2.8) and assuming that A122 is invertible gives
xt = G1 Xt + G2 Xtjt ;

(2.12)

G1 = ¡ (A122 )¡1 A121 ;

(2.13)

G2 = G ¡ G1 :

(2.14)

where G1 and G2 ful…ll

~ W and ±,
The matrices G1 and G2 depend on G and A1 , hence also on B, C ´ C 1 + C 2 , Ci , E,
but (because of the certainty-equivalence) they are independent of D1 , D2 , §uu and §vv .
It follows from (2.7) and (2.12) that the dynamics for Xt and Zt follows
Xt+1 = HXt + JXtjt + ut+1 ;

(2.15)

Zt = LXt + MXtjt + vt ;

(2.16)

where
H ´ A111 + A112 G1 ;

J ´ B1 F + A112 G2 + A211 + A212 G;

(2.18)

L ´ D11 + D21 G1 ;

M ´ D21 G2 + D12 + D22 G;

(2.20)

where Dj = [D1j D2j ] (j = 1; 2) is decomposed according to Xt and xt . (Note that the matrix L
in (2.19) should not be confused with the period loss function Lt in (2.3).)
We note that the problem of estimating the predetermined variables has been transformed to
a problem without forward-looking variables, (2.15) and (2.16). This means that the estimation
problem becomes a simpler variant of the estimation problem with forward-looking variables that
is solved in Pearlman, Currie and Levine [21]. The derivations below is hence a simpli…cation
of that in [21].6
6

Pearlman [20] refers to the complex derivation of the Kalman …lter in Pearlman, Currie and Levine [21] but
doesn’t report that the derivation is actually much easier than in [21].

6

2.1 Optimal …ltering
Assume that the optimal prediction of Xt will be given by a Kalman …lter,
Xtjt = Xtjt¡1 + K(Zt ¡ LXtjt¡1 ¡ MXtjt );

(2.21)

where the Kalman gain matrix K remains to be determined. We can rationalize (2.21) by
observing that Zt ¡ MXtjt = LXt + vt , hence,
Zt ¡ LXtjt¡1 ¡ MXtjt = L(Xt ¡ Xtjt¡1 ) + vt ;
so (2.21) can be written in the conventional form
Xtjt = Xtjt¡1 + K[L(Xt ¡ Xtjt¡1 ) + vt ];

(2.22)

which allows us to identify K as (one form of) the Kalman gain matrix.7 From (2.15) we get
Xt+1jt = (H + J)Xtjt ;

(2.23)

and the dynamics of the model are given by (2.15), (2.12), (2.22) and (2.23).
It remains to …nd an expression for K. appendix B shows, by expressing the problem in
terms of the prediction errors Xt ¡ Xtjt¡1 and Zt ¡ Ztjt¡1 , that K is given by
K = P L0 (LP L0 + §vv )¡1 ;

(2.24)

where the matrix P ´ Cov[Xt ¡ Xtjt¡1 ] is the covariance matrix for the prediction errors Xt ¡
Xtjt¡1 and ful…lls
P = H[P ¡ P L0 (LP L0 + §vv )¡1 LP ]H 0 + §uu :

(2.25)

Thus P can be solved from (2.25), either numerically or analytically, depending upon the complexity of the matrices H, L and §uu . Then K is given by (2.24).
Note that (2.24) and (2.25) imply that K only depends on A1 , D1 , §uu and §vv , and
hence is independent of C 1 , C 2 , Ci , W and ±. Thus, K is independent of the policy chosen.
This demonstrates that the determination of the optimal policy given an estimate of the state
of the economy and the estimation of the state of the economy can be treated as separate
problems, as in the case without forward-looking variables treated in Chow [3], Kalchenbrenner
and Tinsley [14] and LeRoy and Waud [16]. This is no longer true under asymmetric information,
as demonstrated in Svensson and Woodford [37].
7
Harvey [12] de…nies the Kalman gain matrix in this way, whereas Harvey [13] de…nes it as the transition
matrix (yet to be speci…ed in our case) times K.

3 Optimal policy with commitment
Consider again the model described by equations (2.1)–(2.4), but suppose instead that the
central bank commits itself in an initial ex ante state (prior to the realization of any period
zero random variables) to a state-contingent plan for the inde…nite future that minimizes the
expected discounted losses

t=t0

± t Lt 5 :

Here E[¢] indicates the expectation with respect to information in the initial state in period t0 ,
in which the commitment is made. It is important to consider optimal commitment from such
an ex ante perspective, because, in the case of partial information, the information that the
central bank possesses in any given state depends upon the way that it has committed itself to
behave in other states that might have occurred instead.
As shown in Pearlman [20] for a slightly less general case, certainty-equivalence applies in
this case as well. A more intuitive proof of certainty-equivalence is supplied in Svensson and
Woodford [38]. Svensson and Woodford [38] show that the optimal policy under commitment
satis…es
it = F Xtjt + © ¥t¡1 ;

(3.1)

xtjt = GXtjt + ¡ ¥t¡1 ;

(3.2)

¥t = SXtjt + § ¥t¡1 ;

(3.3)

for t ¸ t0 , where F , G, S, ©, ¡ and § are matrices of appropriate dimension, and ¥t is the
vector of (the central bank’s estimate of) the nx Lagrange multiplier of the lower block of (2.1),
the equations corresponding to the forward-looking variables. Furthermore, ¥t0 ¡1 = 0.
Woodford [45] and Svensson and Woodford [36] discuss a socially optimal equilibrium in a
“timeless perspective,” which involves a stationary equilibrium corresponding to a commitment
made far in the past, corresponding to t0 ! ¡1. Then, (3.1)–(3.3) apply for all t > ¡1. Here,
we consider this stationary equilibrium.
Note that (3.3) can then be solved backward to yield
¥t¡1 =

1
X

¿ =0

§¿ SXt¡1¡¿ jt¡1¡¿ :

Thus, the most fundamental di¤erence with respect to the discretion case is that, under the
optimal commitment, xtjt is no longer a linear function of the current estimate of the predetermined variable alone, Xtjt , but instead depends upon past estimates Xt¡¿ jt¡¿ as well. The
8

inertial character of optimal policy that this can result in is illustrated in Woodford [44] and
[45] and in Svensson and Woodford [36].
Svensson and Woodford [36] also show that the socially optimal equilibrium can be achieved
under discretion, if the intertemporal loss function in period t is modi…ed to equal
Et

¿ =0

±¿ Lt+¿ + ¥t¡1 (xt ¡ xtjt¡1 ):

(3.4)

That is, the central bank internalizes the cost of letting the forward-looking variables, xt , deviate
from previous expectations, xtjt¡1 , using the Lagrange multiplier ¥t¡1 for (5.1) in period t ¡ 1,
thus determined in the previous period, as a measure of that cost.8
As explained in detail in Svensson and Woodford [38], the matrices F , G, S, ©, ¡ and §
depend on A; B; C; Ci ; W and ±; but that they are independent of §uu : Thus, these coe¢cients
are the same as in the optimal plan under certainty. This is the certainty-equivalence result for
the case of partial information.
Using the same reasoning as in the derivation of (2.12) and substituting in (3.2) for xtjt , we
obtain
xt = G1 Xt + G2 Xtjt + ¡ ¥t¡1 ;

(3.5)

where G1 and G2 again are given by (2.13) and (2.14). Again, the matrices G1 and G2 , like the
others, are independent of the speci…cations of D, §uu ; and §vv :
Substitution of (3.1), (3.2) and (3.5) into the …rst row of (2.1) furthermore yields
Xt+1 = HXt + JXtjt + ª ¥t¡1 + ut+1 ;

(3.6)

where H and J are again given by (2.17) and (2.18), and
ª ´ A12 ¡ + B1 ©:

(3.7)

Equations (3.3) and (3.5)–(3.6) then describe the evolution of the predetermined and forwardlooking variables, Xt and xt , once we determine the evolution of the estimates Xtjt of the
predetermined variables.
3.1 Optimal …ltering
Substituting (3.5) into (2.4), we obtain
Zt = LXt + MXtjt + ¤ ¥t¡1 + vt ;

(3.8)

Adding a linear term to the loss function is similar to the linear in‡ation contracts discussed in Walsh [42]
and Persson and Tabellini [24]. Indeed, the term added in (3.4) corresponds to a state-contingent linear in‡ation
contract, which, as discussed in Svensson [29], can remedy both stabilization bias and average-in‡ation bias.

where L and M are again given by (2.19) and (2.20), and
¤ ´ D2 ¡:

(3.9)

Equations (3.6) and (3.8) are then the transition and measurement equations for an optimal
…ltering problem. Again the transformation into a problem without forward-looking variables
allows us to derive the estimation equations in a manner that is simpler than that used in
Pearlman, Currie and Levine [21].
The optimal linear prediction of Xt is again given by a Kalman …lter,
Xtjt = Xtjt¡1 + K(Zt ¡ LXtjt¡1 ¡ MXtjt ¡ ¤ ¥t¡1 );

(3.10)

analogously to (2.21). From (3.6) we get
Xt+1jt = (H + J)Xtjt + ª ¥t¡1 ;

(3.11)

and a complete system of dynamic equations for the model is then given by (3.3), (3.5), (3.6),
(3.10) and (3.11).
It remains to …nd an expression for the Kalman gain matrix K: Again, as in appendix B, it
is practical to work in terms of the prediction errors Xt ¡ Xtjt¡1 and Zt ¡ Ztjt¡1 , and equations
(B.1)–(B.13) and (2.24)–(2.25) continue to apply, exactly as in the discretion case. Note that
this implies that the Kalman gain matrix K is exactly the same matrix as in the discretion
equilibrium; in fact, it depends only upon the matrices A1 , §uu , D1 and §vv :

4 Optimal weights on indicators: General remarks
In this section, we o¤er some general conclusions about the way in which the vector of observed
variables Zt , the indicators, is used to estimate the current state of the economy. As in sections
2 and 3, we assume that the central bank and the private sector have the same information, but
our comments apply both to the discretion equilibrium and the commitment equilibrium. In
either case, the observed variables matter only insofar as they a¤ect the central bank’s estimate
Xtjt of the predetermined states.
Let us restate (2.4) and (3.8),
Zt = D11 Xt + D21 xt + D12 Xtjt + D22 xtjt + vt
= LXt + MXtjt + ¤ ¥t¡1 + vt ;
10

where we note that the second equation applies also in the discretion case, if we set ¤ ´ 0 in
that case. When D21 6= 0, the observable variables include or depend on the forward-looking
variables. Then there is a contemporaneous e¤ect of Xtjt on Zt , due to the e¤ect of Xtjt on both
expectations xt+1jt and the equilibrium choice of the instrument it . If D12 6= 0, there is a direct
e¤ect of Xtjt on the observable variables; if D22 6= 0, there is an e¤ect of Xtjt on the observable
variables via xtjt . In the commitment case, if ¤ 6= 0, there is also a lagged e¤ect, through the
e¤ect on ¥t¡1 of Xtjt¡j on for j ¸ 1 (due to (3.3)), which in turn a¤ects Zt through its e¤ect
upon it and xtjt (due to (3.1) and (3.2)).
In order to estimate Xt using a Kalman …lter, we would like to …nd an indicator with the
property that its innovation is a linear function of the forecast error, Xt ¡ Xtjt¡1 , plus noise.
The contemporaneous e¤ect on Zt means that its innovation does not meet this condition, since
Zt ¡ Ztjt¡1 = L(Xt ¡ Xtjt¡1 ) + M(Xtjt ¡ Xtjt¡1 ) + vt ;
which also includes the terms M(Xtjt ¡ Xtjt¡1 ) (we have used that ¥t¡1 = ¥t¡1jt¡1 ). Thus, the
contemporaneous e¤ect enters via MXtjt . In order to eliminate these e¤ects of the estimated
state upon the indicators, we might consider the vector of “ideal” indicators Z¹t , de…ned by the
condition
Z¹t ´ Zt ¡ MXtjt ¡ ¤ ¥t¡1 ;

(4.1)

where the contemporaneous e¤ect is subtracted (the redundant component ¤ ¥t¡1 is also subtracted to get a more parsimonious indicator). These ideal indicators then have the desired
property that their innovation is a linear function of the forecast error of the predetermined
variables plus noise,
Z¹t = LXt + vt ;
Z¹t ¡ Z¹tjt¡1 = L(Xt ¡ Xtjt¡1 ) + vt :
However, these ideal indicators do not provide an operational way of eliminating the contemporaneous in‡uence. Indeed, (4.1) is only an implicit de…nition, in the sense that the estimates
Xtjt that depend on the observable variables still enters into the identity and is assumed to
be known. The ideal indicators can nonetheless provide a useful representation of the …ltering
problem for computational purposes, as we illustrate in the next section.
To get a recursive updating equation that is operational, we instead need one that only has
current observable variables and previous estimates on the right side. We can use the prediction
11

equation (3.10) ((2.21) in the discretion case) and solve for Xtjt to get
Xtjt = (I + KM)¡1 [(I ¡ KL)Xtjt¡1 ¡ K¤ ¥t¡1 + KZt ];

(4.2)

where the matrix I + KM must be invertible. We can then use (3.11) and (3.3) (where ¥t¡1 ´ 0
in the discretion case) to express the dynamic equation for Xtjt in terms of Xt¡1jt¡1 and ¥t¡2 ,
Xtjt = (I + KM)¡1 f(I ¡ KL)[(H + J)Xt¡1jt¡1 + ª ¥t¡2 ] ¡ K¤ (SXt¡1jt¡1 + §¥t¡2 ) + KZt ]
= (I + KM)¡1 f[(I ¡ KL)(H + J) ¡ K¤ S]Xt¡1jt¡1 + [(I ¡ KL)ª ¡ K¤ §]¥t¡2 + KZt g:
(4.3)
Solving the system consisting of this equation and (3.3) backwards, we can express Xtjt as the
weighted sum of current and past observable variables,
Xtjt =

in the commitment case. The consequence of the contemporaneous e¤ect via the matrix M only
shows up in the premultiplication of the matrix (I + KM)¡1 above.
Thus, the evolution over time of the central bank’s estimate of the predetermined states, and
of the Lagrange multipliers needed to determine its action under the commitment equilibrium,
can be expressed as a function of the observable variables. Furthermore, the Kalman gain matrix
K gives the optimal weights on the vector of observable variables.. Row j of K gives the optimal
weights in updating of element j of Xt . Column l of K gives the weights a particular observable
variable Zlt receives in updating the elements of Xt .
Since the estimate is a distributed lag of the observable variables, the estimate is updated only
gradually. Thus, even under discretion, the observed policy will display considerable inertia, the
more the noisier the current observables and the less the weight on current observations relative
to previous estimates.
The elements of the Kalman gain matrix K depend upon the information structure (by (2.24)
and (2.25) they depend on L, which by (2.19) depends on D1 , and on the covariance matrix
12

§vv ). They also depend on part of the dynamics of the predetermined variables (by (2.25), they
depend on H, which by (2.17) and (2.13) depends only on A1 , and on the covariance matrix
§uu ). However, the elements of K are independent of the central-bank’s objective, described by
the matrices C 1 , C 2 , Ci , W and the discount factor ±, or, alternatively, of the central bank’s
reaction function (F; ©) in (3.1) (where © = 0 in the discretion case). This again illustrates the
separation of the estimation problem from the optimization problem that arises under certaintyequivalence.
Suppose that, in row j of L, only one element is nonzero, say element (j; j). Then
Zjt = Xjt + Mj¢ Xtjt + ¤j¢ ¥t¡1 + vjt
corresponds to an observation of Xjt with measurement error vjt (we let

j¢

denote row j of a

matrix, and we assume that element (j; j) of M, mjj , ful…lls mjj 6= ¡1; this is now a necessary
condition for the matrix I + KM to be invertible). Suppose the variance of the measurement
error approaches zero. Then the elements of row j in the Kalman gain matrix will approach
zero, except the element (j; j) which approaches unity. This corresponds to Xjt being fully
observable, resulting in Xjtjt = Xjt . Suppose instead the variance of vjt becomes unboundedly
large. Then Zjt is a useless indicator, and the Kalman gain matrix will assign a zero weight to
this indicator; that is, all the elements in column j of K will be zero.

5 Example: Optimal monetary policy with unobservable potential output
Consider the following simple model, a variant of the model used, for example, in Clarida, Galí
and Gertler [4], Woodford [44] and [45] and Svensson and Woodford [36]. The model equations
are
¼t = ±¼t+1jt + ·(yt ¡ y¹t ) + º t ;

(5.1)

yt = yt+1jt ¡ ¾(it ¡ ¼t+1jt );

(5.2)

y¹t+1 = ° y¹t + ´ t+1 ;

(5.3)

º t+1 = ½º t + "t+1 ;

(5.4)

where ¼t is in‡ation, yt is (log) output, y¹t is (log) potential output (the natural rate of output), º t
is a serially correlated “cost-push” shock, and it is a one-period nominal interest rate (the central
bank’s monetary-policy instrument). In our speci…cation of the exogenous disturbance processes,
the shocks ´t and "t are iid with means zero and variances ¾2´ and ¾2" , and the autoregressive
13

coe¢cients ° and ½ satisfy 0 · °; ½ < 1. In our structural equations, the coe¢cient ± satisfying
0 < ± < 1 is also the discount factor for the central bank’s loss function, and the coe¢cients ·
and ¾ are positive.9
We assume a period loss function of the kind associated with ‡exible in‡ation targeting with
a zero in‡ation target,10

Lt = [¼2t + ¸(yt ¡ y¹t )2 ]:
2

(5.5)

We assume that there is an imperfect observation, y~t , of potential output,
y~t = y¹t + µt ;

(5.6)

where the measurement error µ t is iid with zero mean and variance ¾2µ . We also assume that
in‡ation is directly observable. Then the vector of observables is

(5.7)

Since we assume that there are no unobservable shocks in the aggregate-demand equation,
(5.2), in equilibrium output will be perfectly controllable. Then, we can consider a simpli…ed
variant of your model, with output as the control variable and consisting of the equations (5.1),
(5.3) and (5.4). For the resulting equilibrium stochastic processes for yt , yt+1jt and ¼t+1jt , we
can then use the aggregate-demand equation to infer the corresponding interest rates according
to

Furthermore, current in‡ation and output are here forward-looking variables, whereas they are predetermined
one period in [36]. The assumption that in‡ation and output are predetermined is arguably more realistic, but in
the present context would not allow us to present a simple example in which one of the observables is a forwardlooking variable. A more elaborate example (for instance, along the lines of Svensson [35]), that would be more
realistic but less transparent in its analysis, would allow in‡ation and output to be predetermined, but introduce
other forward-looking indicator variables, such as the exchange rate, a long bond rate, or other asset prices.

which allows us to identify D1 and vt . Once again the thin lines denote the decomposition of
D1 into D11 and D21 . We observe that D2 = 0.
In this model, the central bank needs to form an estimate of the current potential output
and cost-push shock, y¹tjt and º tjt , in order to set policy, the output level yt . It observes an
imperfect measure of potential output, y~t , and in‡ation, ¼t , exactly. Since potential output
is predetermined and independent both of current expectations and of the current instrument
setting, noisy observation of it does not raise any special problems. In contrast, the observed
in‡ation is here a forward-looking variable, which depends both on current expectations of future
in‡ation and the current instrument setting. Current expectations and the instrument setting,
furthermore, depend on the estimates of both current potential output and the current cost-push
shock. These depend on the observation of in‡ation, completing the circle. Thus the central
bank must sort through this simultaneity problem. Consequently our special case, in spite of its
simplicity, incorporates the gist of the signal-extraction problem with forward-looking variables.
5.1 Equilibrium under discretionary optimization and under an optimal commitment
Due to the certainty-equivalence, in order to …nd the optimal policy, we can directly apply
the solution of the full-information version of this model in Clarida, Galí and Gertler [4] and
Svensson and Woodford [36]. Under discretionary optimization, the solution is11

11
See section 3.2 of Svensson and Woodford [36]. Recall that yt ¡ y¹t and º t here corresponds to xt and ut ,
respectively, in [36]. Since the present model has an output target equal to potential output in the period loss
function, (5.5), it corresponds to the case x¤ = 0 in [36].
12
See section 2.1 of Svensson and Woodford [36]. Note that ¥t¡1 here corresponds to 't¡1 in [36]. Because
the present model corresponds to the case x¤ = 0 in [36], '¤ = 0.

(5.11)
(5.12)

In the commitment case, ¥t is the Lagrange multiplier of the constraint corresponding to (5.1)
(the last row of (5.9)), and ¹ (0 < ¹ < 1) is a root of the characteristic equation of the di¤erence
equation for ¥t that results from substitution of the …rst-order conditions into (5.1).
5.2 An optimal targeting rule
The above characterization of the optimal commitment allows us to derive a simple targeting
rule, a rule for the central bank’s target variables ¼t and yt , which represents one practical
approach to the implementation of optimal policy, as discussed in Svensson and Woodford [36].
By (5.10) and (5.12), we have
yt ¡ y¹tjt = ¡

·
¥t ;
¸

(5.13)

and by (5.11) and (5.12), we have
¼t = ¥t ¡ ¥t¡1 .

(5.14)

These are just the …rst-order conditions under commitment, the combination of which with
the dynamic equations (5.1), (5.3) and (5.4) then result in (5.10)–(5.12). We can furthermore
eliminate the Lagrange multipliers from (5.13) and (5.14) and get a consolidated …rst-order
condition,
¸
¼t = ¡ [(yt ¡ y¹tjt ) ¡ (yt¡1 ¡ y¹t¡1jt¡1 )]:
·

(5.15)

In the full-information case, y¹t and y¹t¡1 would be substituted for y¹tjt and y¹t¡1jt¡1 in (5.15).
As discussed in detail in [36], the full-information analogue of (5.15) can be interpreted as
a targeting rule, which if followed by the central bank will result in the full social optimum
under commitment (when the intertemporal loss function with the period loss function (5.5) is
interpreted as the social loss function). Thus, in‡ation should be adjusted to equal the negative
change in the output gap, multiplied by the factor ¸=·.
This targeting rule is remarkable in that it only depends on the relative weight on output-gap
stabilization in the loss function, ¸, and the slope of the short-run Phillips curve, ·. In particular,
the targeting rule is robust to the number and stochastic properties of additive shocks to the
aggregate-supply equation (as witnessed by the lack of dependence on the AR(1) coe¢cient
of the cost-push shock, ½, and the variances of the iid shock, ¾2" ) and (as long as the interest

16

rate does not enter the loss function) completely independent of the aggregate-demand equation
(5.2).
An alternative formulation of the targeting rule is in terms of a target for the price level,
rather than the in‡ation rate. We observe that (5.15) implies that
¸
pt ¡ p¤ = ¡ (yt ¡ y¹tjt );
·

(5.16)

where pt is the (log) price level (¼t ´ pt ¡ pt¡1 ) and p¤ is a constant that can be interpreted as
an implicit price-level target. Similarly, (5.16) implies (5.15), so these are equivalent targeting
rules, each equally consistent with the optimal commitment. (It is worth noting that under
our informational assumptions, pt is also public information at date t.) This illustrates the
close relation between in‡ation targeting under commitment and price-level targeting, further
discussed in Vestin [41], Svensson [33] and [30] and Woodford [44] and [45]. We also note that
under the optimal commitment, the Lagrange multipliers satisfy
¥t = pt ¡ p¤ :

(5.17)

This is useful below as an empirical proxy for variation in the Lagrange multipliers.
An interesting feature of both of these characterizations of optimal policy is that, under
partial information, the targeting rule has exactly the same form as under full information,
except that the estimated output gap, yt ¡ ytjt , is consistently substituted for the actual output
gap, yt ¡ y¹t . Thus, policy should respond to exactly the same extent to the estimated output
gap under partial information as to the actual output gap under full information. This is a clear
illustration of the certainty-equivalence result demonstrated earlier in the paper.
However, it is important to note that the targeting rules (5.15) and (5.16) are written in
terms of the optimal estimate of the output gap, yt ¡ y¹tjt , not in terms of the output-gap measure
yt ¡ y~t implied by the imperfect observation of potential output, y~t . As we shall see, the optimal
degree of response to an imperfect observation of the output gap does indeed depend on the
degree of noise in the observation.
5.3 An optimal instrument rule (in terms of the optimal estimate of the predetermined variables)
We now consider instead the nature of an optimal instrument rule, specifying how the central
bank’s instrument, the nominal interest rate it ; should be set each period, both as a function
17

of the optimal estimate of the predetermined variables (corresponding to (2.7) or (3.1)) and
as a function of the observations of the observable variables up through the current period
(corresponding to (2.7) or (3.1) when (4.4) are substituted for Xtjt ). We shall give particular
attention to the question of how the coe¢cients of such a rule are a¤ected by the presence of
measurement error in the observable measure of the output gap, y~t :
We …rst must compute the evolution of the nominal interest rate under the optimal commitment characterized above. We recall that output and in‡ation evolve according to equations of
the form
yt = y¹tjt + fº tjt + ©¥t¡1 ;

(5.18)

¼t = gº tjt + ¡¥t¡1 ;

(5.19)

where the coe¢cients f; g; © and ¡ are identi…ed in (5.10) and (5.11). Substituting these
solutions for output and in‡ation into (5.8), and using (5.3) and (5.4) to forecast y¹t+1jt and
º t+1jt as multiples of y¹tjt and º tjt ; we obtain

it = ¡ (1 ¡ °) y¹tjt + [½g ¡ (1 ¡ ½)f] º tjt + [¡ + ©] ¥t ¡ © ¥t¡1 :

(5.20)

It remains to express the variables on the right-hand side of (5.20) in terms of observables.
We next recall that in the optimal equilibrium, the values of ¥t and º tjt can be inferred from
the (observable) path of the price level, using (5.17) and inverting (5.19) to obtain

It still remains, however, to express y¹tjt as a function of the observables. This requires consideration of an optimal …ltering problem.
18

Note that if we were content to derive an instrument rule in terms of the optimal estimate of
potential output, y¹tjt , rather than the noisy observation of that variable, y~t ; then (5.22) would
serve. In this case, certainty-equivalence applies once again; one observes that the coe¢cients
#; ¹0 ; and ¹1 are all independent of the degree of noise in the observation of potential output.
However, the evolution of the optimal estimate y¹tjt as a function of the observables does depend
upon the degree of noise in the observation y~t :
5.4 The …ltering problem
We turn next to that …ltering problem, which requires us to determine the law of motion for
Xtjt , a problem treated in sections 3 and 4. Note that equations (5.10) and (5.11) have already
allowed us to identify the matrices F , ©, G, ¡, S and § in (3.1)–(3.3). We are then able to
compute the matrices

Thus, the …ltering problem may be reduced to one of observing a noisy measure of potential
output, y¹t + µt , along with a linear combination of potential output and the cost-push shock,
¡·¹
yt + º t . That observation of the forward-looking in‡ation rate implies the observability of
this linear combination of the potential output and cost-push shock is quite intuitive. From the
aggregate supply equation (5.1) we see that, in equilibrium, observability of ¼t , ¼t+1jt and yt
implies that the remainder, ¡·¹
yt + º t , must be observable as well.

19

The ideal indicators are not operational, as their de…nition above involves y¹tjt and º tjt , which
we seek to determine. However, consideration of the simple problem that would result if these
indicators were available is useful as a way of determining the Kalman gain matrix K. This
estimation problem consists of the simple transition equation,

is, A112 = 0, A211 = 0, A212 = 0, B1 = 0.
In appendix C, we derive an analytical expression for the Kalman gain matrix,

as a function of the coe¢cients ·, °, ½ and the variances ¾2´ , ¾2" and ¾2µ . We furthermore show
that the elements of K satisfy

k12 ´ ·k11 < 0;

k21 ´ ·k12 + 1 > 0:

(5.29)

Note that these elements depend on the variances of the shocks. In particular, we can
examine how the response to the noisy measure of potential output y~t depends on the degree of
noise in this measure, i.e., the variance of the measurement error ¾ 2µ . In appendix C, we show
that, in the limit as ¾ 2µ ! 1,
k11 ; k21 ! 0;

k12 ! k12

k22 ! k22

(5.30)

Thus, the optimal weights on the measure of potential output go to zero when its information
content goes to zero. This is an example of the Kalman …lter assigning zero weight to useless
indicators, mentioned in section 4. Again, this does not mean that the response to the optimal
estimate of potential output, y¹tjt , changes. By certainty-equivalence, it stays the same. It is
only that the measure of potential output y~t is disregarded in the construction of the optimal
estimate. Instead, in this case the central bank will rely only on the observed in‡ation rate in
estimating potential output.

20

Having determined the Kalman gain matrix K, we may return to the consideration of an
operational procedure for computing the optimal estimates of the underlying exogenous disturbances. For this the central bank can use the operational recursive updating equations (4.3),
which in the present case may be written

This last equation is simpler than (4.3), because in our example J = 0 and ª = 0.

Furthermore, in writing the updating equation for y¹tjt ; we can use the fact that we have
already solved for º tjt as a function of the history of the price level, in (5.21). The updating
equation for y¹tjt then takes the simple form
y¹tjt = ! y¹t¡1jt¡1 + ®0 (pt ¡ p¤ ) + ®1 (pt¡1 ¡ p¤ ) + ³ y~t ;

5.5 Optimal instrument rules in terms of observable variables
Let us …nally derive optimal instrument rules in terms of observations of the observable variables
up through the current period. Solving (5.22) for y¹tjt as a function of it and the history of the
price index, and substituting that expression for y¹tjt in (5.32), we obtain a law of motion for
interest rates of the form
it = !it¡1 +

2

j=0

¯ j (pt¡j ¡ p¤ ) ¡ » y~t

(5.34)

where the coe¢cients are given in appendix D. This can be interpreted as an instrument rule
for setting the nominal interest rate as a function of the observables, namely the price level and
the potential output measure y~t :
As is explained further in appendix D, the coe¢cients of rule (5.34) depend upon the variances of the various disturbances, so that certainty-equivalence does not apply to this particular
characterization of optimal policy. In particular, it is shown that
» ´ #³ > 0:
21

It then follows from (5.30) and (5.33) that in the limit as ¾ 2µ ! 1; ³ ! 0; from which it follows
that » ! 0 as well. On the other hand, it is shown in appendix D that the ¯ j coe¢cients remain
bounded away from zero. Thus in the limiting case of an extremely noisy measure of potential
output, the optimal instrument rule makes the interest rate solely a function of the history of
the price level.
The instrument rule (5.34) makes the interest rate a function solely of the history of the
price level, and of the measure of potential output, as these have been assumed to be the only
observables. However, we may consider the question of how the interest rate should depend on
a measure of the output gap, if we now assume instead that real output yt is directly observable
as well. This assumption implies no change in the information structure, since (5.2) already
implies that yt must belong to the period-t information set (in the sense that its value can be
inferred precisely from the variables that are directly observed, even if it is not itself directly
observed). However, adding yt to the list of period-t observables does make possible a more
‡exible class of explicit instrument rules, as interest rates may now be made a function of the
history of the price level, of the potential-output measure, or of the level of output.
In this case, there will no longer be a unique optimal instrument rule. The rule (5.34) would
still count as one explicit rule that is consistent with the optimal equilibrium; but because
of the presence of a redundant observable, there would no longer be a unique such rule, as
rules consistent with the same equilibrium could also be constructed with any given degree of
dependence upon the observation of yt . One way of resolving this indeterminacy is to assume
that the rule should depend only upon the history of prices and of the “direct” measure of the
output gap, namely, the quantity yt ¡ y~t ; rather than allowing for any independent response to
either yt or y~t .
It is shown in appendix D that the unique optimal instrument rule of this kind is of the form
it = °it¡1 +

~ (pt¡j ¡ p¤ ) + ~» (yt ¡ y~t );
¯
j

(5.35)

where the coe¢cients are de…ned in the appendix. We note in particular that
~» ´ ¸ ³ > 0:
1¡³
Thus in the case that we do not allow separate responses to current output and potential output,
it is optimal for the interest rate to be an increasing function of the current direct measure of
the output gap.
22

Once again, one observes that in the limit as ¾2µ ! 1; ³ ! 0; so that the optimal coe¢cient

~» ! 0: Extreme noise in the measure of potential output implies that the measure of the output
gap based on it is similarly noisy, and so it is optimal not to respond to such an indicator at all.
Instead, in the limit it is again optimal to respond only to the history of the price level.

6 Conclusions
In this paper, we have restated the important result that, under symmetric partial information,
certainty-equivalence and the separation principle continue to hold in the case of linear rationalexpectations models and a quadratic loss function. Then optimal policy as a function of the
current estimate of the state of the economy is the same as if the state were observed.
However, policy as a function of the observable variables (and the actual, as distinct from the
estimated, state of the economy) will display considerable inertia, since the current estimate will
be a distributed lag of the current and past observable variables (and actual states of the economy). Thus, discretionary policy—which, as discussed in Woodford [44] and [45] and Svensson
and Woodford [36], often lacks the history-dependence that characterizes optimal policy under
commitment—will in this case display a certain inertial character as a consequence of partial
information. It seems likely that this inertial character will be more pronounced the noisier the
information in the observable variables, as this should lead to slower updating of the current
estimate of the state of the economy. To what extent this may a¤ect the welfare comparison
between discretionary policy and the optimal policy under commitment (which represents the
social optimum) is a topic for future research.
Even given certainty-equivalence and the separation principle, the estimation problem with
forward-looking observable variables presents a challenge, due to the circularity in the way that
the observable variables both a¤ect and depend on the current estimate. The optimal operational
Kalman …lter under these circumstances needs to be modi…ed to circumvent that circularity, as
we have shown.
Our results have been derived under the assumption of symmetric information between the
central bank and the aggregate private sector, as a result of which certainty-equivalence and the
separation between optimization and estimation hold. This case seems to us to be of practical
interest, since we believe that any informational advantage of central banks consists mainly
of better information about their own intentions (as in the papers of Cukierman and Meltzer
[5] and Faust and Svensson [9]). Any such private information is nowadays increasingly being
23

eroded by the general tendency toward increased transparency in monetary policy, whether
willingly adopted by the central banks or, in some cases, forced upon them by irresistible outside
demands. Nevertheless, it is of interest to understand how these results are modi…ed when there
is asymmetric information (especially in the direction of central banks having less information
than parts of the private sector); this topic is taken up in Svensson and Woodford [37].
We have illustrated our general results in terms of a forward-looking model of monetary
policy with unobservable potential output and a partially observable cost-push shock, where the
observable variables both a¤ect and depend on the current estimates of potential output and the
cost-push shock. This situation is obviously highly relevant for many central banks, including
the recently established Eurosystem. We note that our analysis of optimal policy does imply
an important role for an estimate of current potential output, and that the proper weight to
be put on such an estimate under an optimal policy rule is una¤ected by the degree of noise
in available measures of potential output. Thus the lack of more accurate measures is not a
reason for policy to respond less to optimally estimated ‡uctuations in the output gap (though
inaccuracy of particular indicators can be a reason for a bank’s estimate of the output gap to
be less in‡uenced by those indicators). This is an important quali…cation of Orphanides’s [17]
suggestion that monetary policy should not respond to uncertain real-time output-gap data. If
those data represent an optimal estimate of the output gap, then the optimal response should
be the same as under certainty. If instead the data represent only a noisy observation of the
true output gap, the optimal response will indeed depend on the degree of noise.
Thus in the case of pure indicator variables—variables that are neither target variables
(variables that enter the loss function) nor direct causal determinants of target variables, and that
accordingly would not be responded to under an optimal policy in the case of full information—
the degree to which monetary policy should take account of them is de…nitely dependent upon
how closely they are in fact associated with the (causal) state variables that one seeks to estimate.
This precept does not always play as large a role in current central banking practice as it might.
As an example, the Eurosystem has put special emphasis on one particular indicator, the
growth of Euro-area M3 relative to a reference value of 4.5 percent per year, elevating this
money-growth indicator to the status of one of two “pillars” of the Eurosystem monetary strategy
(in addition to “a broadly-based assessment of the outlook for future price developments”).13
Money growth in excess of the reference value is supposed to indicate “risks to price stability.”
13

See, for instance, European Central Bank [8].

24

As discussed by commentators such as Svensson [32], Rudebusch and Svensson [22] and Gerlach
and Svensson [11], it is di¢cult to …nd rational support for this prominence of the moneygrowth indicator. Instead, monetary aggregates would seem to be properly viewed as just one
set of indicators among many others, the relative weight on which should exclusively depend on
their performance in predicting the relevant aspects of the current state of the economy; more
speci…cally, how useful current money growth is as an input in conditional forecasts of in‡ation
some two years ahead.
Under normal circumstances, the information content of money growth for in‡ation forecasts
in the short and medium term seems to be quite low.14 Only in the long run does a high
correlation between money growth and in‡ation result. Under the special circumstances of the
introduction of a new common currency, the demand for money is likely to be quite unpredictable
and possibly very unstable, since important structural changes are likely to occur in …nancial
markets and banking. Under such circumstances, the information content of money is likely on
theoretical grounds to be even lower than under normal circumstances. Thus the uncertainty
associated with the introduction of the new currency should provide an argument for relying
less, rather than more, on monetary aggregates as indicators.15
14

See Estrella and Mishkin [7] and Stock and Watson [27]; Gerlach and Svensson [11] …nd, for reconstructed
Euro-area data, information for future in‡ation in another monetary indicator, the “real money gap,” but little
or no information in the Eurosystem’s money-growth indicator.
15
Furthermore, the high long-run correlation between money and prices found in historical data may to some
extent depend on the high money growth and in‡ation that have occurred in the past, dominating ‡uctuations
in output and velocity. Under a low-in‡ation regime of the kind that the ECB is expected to maintain, even the
long-run correlation may well be weaker.

A Optimization under discretion and certainty-equivalence
Consider the decision problem to choose it in period t to minimize (2.6) (with 0 < ± < 1) under
discretion, that is, subject to (2.1)–(2.5) and
it+1 = Ft+1 Xt+1jt+1
xt+1jt+1 = Gt+1 Xt+1jt+1 ;

(A.1)
(A.2)

where Ft+1 and Gt+1 are determined by the decision problem in period t + 1.
For the full information case, Oudiz and Sachs [18] have derived an algorithm for the discretionary equilibrium, which is further discussed in Backus and Dri¢ll [2] and Currie and Levin
[6].16 Following Pearlman [20], but with a more explicit proof, this appendix shows that this
algorithm, appropriately adapted, is valid also for the partial-information case.
First, using (A.2), taking expectations in period t of the upper block of (2.1), and using
(2.10), we get
xt+1jt = Gt+1 Xt+1jt = Gt+1 (A11 Xtjt + A12 xtjt + B1 it ):

(A.3)

Taking the expectation in period t of the lower block of (2.1), we get

Third, since the loss function is quadratic and the constraints are linear, it follows that the

where
Ft ´ ¡ (Rt¤ + ±Bt¤0 Vt+1 Bt¤ )¡1 (Ut¤0 + ±Bt¤0 Vt+1 A¤t )

Finally, the above equations de…ne a mapping from (Ft+1 ; Gt+1 ; Vt+1 ) to (Ft ; Gt ; Vt ). The
solution to the problem is a …xpoint (F; G; V ) of the mapping. It is obtained as the limit of
(Ft ; Gt ; Vt ) when t ! ¡1. The solution thus ful…lls the corresponding steady-state matrix
equations. Thus, the instrument it and the estimate of the forward-looking variables xtjt will be
linear functions, (2.7) and (2.8) of the estimate of the predetermined variables Xtjt , where the
corresponding F and G ful…ll the corresponding steady-state equations. In particular, G will

It also follows that F , G and V only depend on A ´ A1 + A2 , B, C ´ C 1 + C 2 , Ci ; E;

± and are independent of D1 , D2 , §uu and §vv . This demonstrates the certainty-equivalence of
the discretionary equilibrium.
It remains to verify the assumption that lt in (A.8) is independent of it . Since by (2.12)–
(2.13), xt ¡xtjt = ¡ (A122 )¡1 A121 (Xt ¡Xtjt ), it is su¢cient to demonstrate that E[(Xt ¡Xtjt )(Xt ¡
Xtjt )0 jIt ] is independent of it . By (2.22),
Xt ¡ Xtjt = Xt ¡ Xtjt¡1 + K(L(Xt ¡ Xtjt¡1 ) + vt = (I + KL)(Xt ¡ Xtjt¡1 ) + Kvt :
Since Xt and Xtjt¡1 are predetermined and vt is exogenous, the assumption is true.

B The Kalman gain matrix and the covariance of the forecast errors
It is practical to express the dynamics in terms of the prediction errors of Xt and Zt , relative to
period t ¡ 1 information,
~ t ´ Xt ¡ Xtjt¡1 ;
X
Z~t ´ Zt ¡ Ztjt¡1 = Zt ¡ (L + M)Xtjt¡1 ;
where we have used (2.16). Then the prediction equation can be written

Xtjt = Xtjt¡1 + K(LX

(B.1)

First, (2.16) implies that
Ztjt¡1 = (L + M)Xtjt¡1
and hence that
~ t + M(Xtjt ¡ Xtjt¡1 ) + vt
Z~t = LX
Substitution of (B.1) into this then yields

Z~t = (I + MK)(LX

(C.19)

Using the notation in (5.27) for the elements of K, we observe from (C.18) that
k11 > 0;

k21 > 0:

We note furthermore that (C.7) and (C.12) imply that jP¹ j > 0; and that this together with

¡1
> 0: It then follows from (C.17) that
(C.13) implies that P¹12

k12 < 0;
completing the derivation of (5.29).
Finally, we observe that
jP¹ j(k22 ¡ k11 ) = jP¹ j(1 + ·k12 ¡ k11 )

Here the …rst line uses (C.19), the second line uses (C.5), (C.6) and (C.17), and the …nal
inequality follows from (C.15) and the fact that q > 0: Hence
k22 > k11 ;
34

completing the derivation of (5.28).
It remains to consider the limit of K when ¾2µ ! 1, that is, when y~t becomes an unboundedly

noisy indicator of y¹t . We divide (C.8) by ¾2µ and observe in (C.9) and (C.11) that
a

~ ´ ·2 (½ ¡ °)2 > 0;
! ~b ´ ·2 (1 ¡ ½2 )¾2´ + (1 ¡ ° 2 )¾2" > 0;
! c~ ´ ¡¾2´ ¾2" > 0;

when ¾2µ ! 1. It follows that q ! q~; where q~ is bounded and positive. Thus it follows from
(C.18) that k11 ! 0, and from (C.19) that k21 ! 0 as well.

On the other hand, we note from (C.6) and (C.17) that k12 depends on ¾2µ only through

its dependence upon q, so that the limiting value of k12 is obtained by replacing q by q~ in the
formula. Furthermore, the same argument that is used above to establish inequality (C.13)
implies that the same inequality holds in the case of q~, so that (C.6) continues to imply that
¡1
P¹12
> 0 when q is replaced by q~. Hence k12 remains bounded away from zero as ¾2µ ! 1.

Similarly, the argument that is used above to establish (C.15) implies that the same inequality
is satis…ed by q~; so that the formula for k22 ¡ k11 remains positive when q is replaced by q~: It
then follows that k22 also remains bounded away from zero as ¾2µ ! 1.
This completes the derivation of (5.30). Thus, in this limit both estimates y¹tjt and º tjt are
functions solely of the history of observations of the price level.

D Optimal instrument rules for the example economy
Here we present the details of the derivation of the optimal instrument rules (5.34) and (5.35),
for the example of section 5. We begin by evaluating the matrices of coe¢cients in the updating
equation (5.31). Since we wish to extract from this matrix equation only the …rst row, the
updating equation for y¹tjt ; we need only evaluate the …rst row of each of the matrices. We …rst
observe from (5.24) and (C.19) that the …rst row of (I + KM)¡1 K is given by
·

k11
k22

¸

k12
:
gk22

We then observe that the …rst row of (I + KM)¡1 K¤ is given by
¡

1 ¡ ¹ k12

g k22
35

and that the …rst row of (I + KM)¡1 (I ¡ KL)H is given by
·

¸

k12
:
k22

In these expressions, g ´ ¹=(1 ¡ ±½¹) as before, while k11 ; k12 and k22 are the elements of the
Kalman gain matrix characterized in appendix C.
The …rst row of (5.31) can then be written in the form
yt¡1jt¡1 + $º º t¡1jt¡1 + $p (pt¡1 ¡ p¤ ) + ³ y~t + $¼ ¼t ;
y¹tjt = !¹

Substituting (5.21) for º t¡1jt¡1 , and

¼t ´ (pt ¡ p¤ ) ¡ (pt¡1 ¡ p¤ )
for ¼t ; this can be rewritten in the form
y¹tjt = ! y¹t¡1jt¡1 + ®0 (pt ¡ p¤ ) + ®1 (pt¡1 ¡ p¤ ) + ³ y~t ;
where ! and ³ are de…ned as above, while
1 ¡ ½ k12
;
g k22
´ ¡¹®0 :

®0 ´
®1

We thus obtain (5.32) and (5.33 in the text.
We next observe that we can solve (5.22) for y¹tjt , obtaining
1
y¹tjt = ¡ [it ¡ ¹0 (pt ¡ p¤ ) ¡ ¹1 (pt¡1 ¡ p¤ )];
#

(D.1)

where the coe¢cients #; ¹0 and ¹1 are de…ned as in (5.22). Substituting this for y¹tjt in (5.32),
we obtain a law of motion for the nominal interest rate of the form
it = !it¡1 +

¯ 2 ´ ¡ !¹1 :
We thus obtain an instrument rule of the form (5.34).
The derivation of (5.35) proceeds along similar lines. We note that (5.18) implies that the
“direct measure” of the output gap, yt ¡ y~t ; will be given in equilibrium by
yt ¡ y¹tjt ) + f º tjt + © (pt¡1 ¡ p¤ );
yt ¡ y~t = ¡(~

(D.2)

where once again

Subtracting ³ y¹tjt from both sides of (5.32), and then solving (D.2) for y~t ¡ y¹tjt as a function of
the output-gap measure and substituting this expression into the updating equation to eliminate
the term y~t ¡ y¹tjt , we obtain the alternative updating equation
(1 ¡ ³)¹
ytjt = ! y¹t¡1jt¡1 + ®0 (pt ¡ p¤ ) + (®1 + ³©) (pt¡1 ¡ p¤ ) + ³f º tjt ¡ ³ (yt ¡ y~t ):
Dividing both sides by 1 ¡ ³ (which is necessarily positive because of (5.28)), and again
substituting out the º tjt term using (5.21), this becomes
y¹tjt = ° y¹t¡1jt¡1 + ®
~ 0 (pt ¡ p¤ ) + ®
~ 1 (pt¡1 ¡ p¤ ) ¡ ³~ (yt ¡ y~t );

Here we have written the updating equation as a function of the measure of the output gap,
rather than the measure of potential output as in (5.32). (The coe¢cient ° appears in (D.3)
because ! ´ °(1 ¡ ³):)
We can then derive a law of motion for the nominal interest rate from (D.3), by substituting
(D.1) for y¹tjt , just as we did above in the case of (5.32) in order to derive (5.34). We thus obtain
37

This is an explicit instrument rule of the form (5.35), in which the nominal interest rate is set
as a function of the history of the price level and the “direct” measure of the output gap.

E The Kalman …lter
As a convenient reference, we restate the relevant expressions for the Kalman …lter (see Harvey
[12] and [13]) in our notation. Let the measurement and transition equations be, respectively,
Zt = LXt + vt ;
Xt+1 = T Xt + ut+1 ;
where E[ut vs0 ] = 0 for all t and s. De…ne the covariance matrices of the one-period-ahead and
within-period prediction errors by
Ptjt¡1 ´ E[(Xt ¡ Xtjt¡1 )(Xt ¡ Xtjt¡1 )0 ];
Ptjt ´ E[(Xt ¡ Xtjt )(Xt ¡ Xtjt )0 ]:
The covariance matrix of the innovations, Zt ¡ Ztjt¡1 , ful…lls
E[(Zt ¡ Ztjt¡1 )(Zt ¡ Ztjt¡1 )0 ] = LPtjt¡1 L0 + §vv :
The prediction equations are
Xtjt¡1 = T Xt¡1jt¡1 ;
Ptjt¡1 = T Pt¡1jt¡1 T 0 + §uu ;

38

and the updating equations are
Xtjt = Xtjt¡1 + Kt (Zt ¡ LXtjt¡1 );
Kt ´ Ptjt¡1 L0 (LPtjt¡1 L0 + §vv )¡1 ;
Ptjt = Ptjt¡1 ¡ Ptjt¡1 L0 (LPtjt¡1 L0 + §vv )¡1 LPtjt¡1 :
In a steady state, we have
Ptjt¡1 = P;
Ptjt = P ¡ P L0 (LP L0 + §vv )¡1 LP;
Kt = K;
K = P L0 (LP L0 + §vv )¡1 ;
P

= T [P ¡ P L0 (LP L0 + §vv )¡1 LP ]T 0 + §uu :
