It is argued, however, that too little time has passed for conclusions to be drawn, so that tentative evaluations of inflation targeting need to be based on theoretical analysis and more generalized historical experiences.  Accordingly, two alternative rationalizations are considered, one stemming from the literature on dynamic inconsistency and the other based on more pragmatic considerations.  In addition, it is asked whether some other nominal magnitude might be preferable as a target variable and the issue of growth-rate versus growing-level target paths is addressed.\n\n",
