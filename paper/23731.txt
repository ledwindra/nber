ABSTRACT
We develop a unique survey that focuses on the job search behavior of individuals regardless of
their labor force status and field it annually starting in 2013. We use our survey to study the
relationship between search effort and outcomes for the employed and non-employed. Three
important facts stand out: (1) on-the-job search is pervasive, and is more intense at the lower
rungs of the job ladder; (2) the employed are about four times more efficient than the unemployed
in job search; and (3) the employed receive better job offers than the unemployed. We set up an
on-the-job search model with endogenous search effort, calibrate it to fit our new facts, and find
that the search effort of the employed is highly elastic. We show that search effort substantially
amplifies labor market responses to job separation and matching efficiency shocks over the
business cycle.

Introduction

Job-to-job transitions are an important feature of the U.S. labor market. They account for onethird to one-half of all hiring (Fallick and Fleischman, 2004) and are an important driver of
reallocation, wage growth, and productivity growth (Faberman and Justiniano, 2015; Moscarini
and Postel-Vinay, 2017; Karahan et al., 2017; Haltiwanger et al., 2018). Despite the critical
importance of on-the-job search for understanding labor market dynamics and the central role
it has in search theories of the labor market, evidence on its extent and nature remains scant,
much in contrast with the abundance of evidence on the job search behavior of the unemployed.
In this paper, we help fill this void with new evidence on the job search behavior and job
search outcomes of the employed and non-employed alike. To this end, we design and implement a
unique new survey that focuses on job search behavior and outcomes for all individuals, regardless
of their labor force status. Existing labor force surveys typically only collect information on the
search behavior of the unemployed. We administer the survey as a supplement to the Survey of
Consumer Expectations and have fielded it annually each October since 2013. The survey asks
an expansive list of questions on the employment status and current job search, if any, of all
respondents, including questions on an individual’s search effort, search methods and outcomes,
the incidence of informal recruiting methods, and demographic information. Consequently, our
survey represents an enormous expansion of available information on the job search process.
Our findings provide the most comprehensive evidence to date on the nature of on-the-job
search for the U.S. While we uncover multiple new facts, three key findings stand out. First, the
employed frequently engage in on-the-job search, with around 20 percent of the employed looking
for work in the prior four weeks, and with similar fractions applying to at least one job in the last
month or searching at least once in the last seven days. Their search intensity declines strongly
with their current wage, consistent with a central prediction of models that include on-the-job
search. In these models, workers with low wages search harder as they attempt to climb the
job ladder. Controlling for observable worker characteristics, we estimate an elasticity of search
intensity with respect to the current wage that is between -0.52 and -0.36.
Second, on-the-job search is more effective than search by the unemployed: employed job
seekers receive a similar number of offers despite exerting a fraction of the search effort of the

2

unemployed. We define search efficiency as job offers received per unit of search effort and
estimate that the employed are about four times more efficient at job search. If we were to
rely only on transition rates—a common approach in the literature due to lack of data on job
search effort—we would find the opposite result: that the unemployed are about seven times
more efficient. The contrast in implications underscores the value of collecting data on search
behavior for both employed and non-employed individuals. The search efficiency of the employed
is a key statistic in models of on-the-job search and has important implications for aggregate
wage and productivity growth.
Third, the employed appear to sample from a higher-quality job offer distribution than the
unemployed. Unconditionally, the wages offered to the employed are 36 log points (44 percent)
higher than the wages offered to the unemployed. Accounting for observable worker and job
characteristics only reduces the wage offer differential to 19 log points (21 percent). The finding
that employed workers receive better wage offers suggests that factors that are unique to employment status are important determinants of the hiring process. An obvious concern about this
interpretation, however, is that unobserved differences in productivity between employed and
unemployed job seekers may be the reason for what appears to be a wage offer premium. Those
with higher unobserved skills are more likely to be employed and earn higher wages, so a wage
offer premium is a natural consequence of this selection effect. Consequently, an individual’s
prior work history provides a useful proxy for unobserved heterogeneity that may be correlated
with one’s current labor force status. We have survey data on such labor force histories over
an individual’s previous five years, but controlling for these histories only reduces the wage offer
premium to 13 log points (14 percent).
In the second part of our paper, we match our new facts to an on-the-job search model
with endogenous search effort. The model is in the spirit of Christensen, Lentz, Mortensen,
Neumann, and Werwatz (2005), though we enrich the framework with various additional features
supported by our data. These include differential search efficiency and search costs, unobserved
heterogeneity in worker productivity, and differential censoring of job offers among the employed
and unemployed. We parameterize the model carefully by matching it to a number of key moments
from our survey data. Our model provides a good fit to the various features of the data: search
behavior, search efficiency, and wage offer differentials between employed and unemployed job
3

seekers. Two implications follow immediately from our calibration exercise. First, the unemployed
are willing to accept low-paying job offers despite a relatively high value of nonemployment.
Given the high relative search efficiency of the employed we identify in the data, the unemployed
are better off accepting a low-paying job so they can enjoy the efficiency of on-the-job search.
Second, most, but not all, of the residual wage offer premium enjoyed by the employed is due
to differences in unobserved heterogeneity by labor force status. Our calibration suggests that
about one-quarter of the residual wage offer premium (4 log points), and only ten percent of the
unconditional wage offer premium, is attributable to factors outside of our model.
We also calibrate our model to replicate the negative empirical elasticity between search effort
and wages. This elasticity uniquely identifies the elasticity of search costs in the model and has
direct implications for how search intensity responds to changes in aggregate labor market conditions. In particular, we find that job search effort is more elastic than suggested by a quadratic
search cost function—the most common assumption in the literature (e.g., Christensen et al.,
2005; Hornstein, Krusell, and Violante, 2011).1 To quantify the macroeconomic implications of
this higher elasticity, we consider the economy’s response to a recession where job separations
increase and matching efficiency decreases. Both shocks reduce the return to search and lower job
search activity. We find that the decline in search effort in our experiment is about 50 percent
larger relative to a model with quadratic search costs, leading to substantial amplification of
the declines in the job-finding rate and job-to-job transitions. Search effort also responds more
strongly as labor market conditions improve, increasing the speed of reallocation to better jobs
on the job ladder.2 Our experiment thus highlights the importance of modeling job search effort
endogenously and with the appropriate degree of responsiveness to business cycle shocks.
In sum, our paper breaks new ground along several dimensions: First, we design and implement a unique new survey, which administers questions about job search behavior and job
search outcomes regardless of employment status. Second, we use the survey to document several new stylized facts on the search process of the employed relative to the unemployed. Our
findings speak to margins that are at the heart of on-the-job search models but have been mostly
1

Christensen et al. infer the value of the elasticity from how job-to-job transitions relate to the current wage,
which is challenging due to the fact that not all transitions are related to movements up the job ladder. Our
approach is different as we relate search behavior directly to the current wage of the job.

Highly elastic search effort would likely lead to further amplification in the presence of feedback effects of
search behavior on vacancy postings, as in Eeckhout and Lindenlaub (2019).

unobservable in data available thus far. We find that on-the-job search dominates search while
unemployed along several key dimensions. Finally, we examine our findings through the lens of
a job-ladder model and show that search effort is more elastic than typically assumed in the
literature, with important implications for the response of the economy to aggregate shocks that
affect the returns to search.

1.1

Related Literature

The majority of the literature has typically focused on the unemployed, primarily because of
limited availability of on-the-job search data. Some studies that focus on the unemployed use
the number of job search methods as a measure of search effort (Shimer, 2004), while others use
direct measures of time spent looking for work (Krueger and Mueller, 2010; Aguiar, Hurst, and
Karabourbanis, 2013; and Mukoyama, Patterson, and Şahin, 2018) or job applications sent by
a survey group (Krueger and Mueller, 2011). Notable exceptions that have examined on-thejob search include earlier work by Kahn (1982), Holzer (1987), and Blau and Robins (1990), all
of which use older, discontinued surveys. Recent studies use the American Time Use Survey
(ATUS) to document on-the-job search behavior (Mueller, 2010; Ahn and Shao, 2017), but the
diary-based structure of the ATUS and its lack of data on job offers do not allow it to provide a
complete picture of on-the-job search. A growing literature studies job search behavior using job
application data from online job search platforms (Kuhn and Shen, 2013; Kroft and Pope, 2014;
Marinescu, 2017; Hershbein and Kahn, 2018; Faberman and Kudlyak, 2019; Banfi and VillenaRoldan, 2019, among others). While this literature has started to provide novel insights into the
job search process, the data are not based on detailed surveys, so they typically lack information
on labor force status and job search outcomes, such as the incidence and characteristics of job
offers.
Despite a lack of supporting data, the literature on labor search theory has recognized the
importance of on-the-job search as far back as early work by Parsons (1973) and Burdett (1978).
More recently, Christensen et al., (2005), Cahuc, Postel-Vinay, and Robin (2006), and Bagger
and Lentz (2019), among others, have documented the importance of on-the-job search and its
related job ladder dynamics. There is also a natural connection between our paper and a growing
literature that emphasizes the importance of on-the-job search for macroeconomic outcomes.

5

Eeckhout and Lindenlaub (2019) provide an elegant theory where the search behavior of employed
workers generates large labor market fluctuations even in the absence of other shocks through
a strategic complementary between on-the-job search and vacancy posting. Elsby, Michaels and
Ratner (2015) carefully characterize the implications of on-the-job search for the Beveridge curve,
and Moscarini and Postel-Vinay (2019) and Faccini and Melosi (2019) link on-the-job search to
inflation. The latter two studies argue that when employment is concentrated at the bottom of
the job ladder, typically following a recession, employed workers search harder to find a better
job. As workers climb the job ladder, the labor market tightens and generates inflation pressures.
We conclude that, given the growing interest in the job ladder implications of business cycle
fluctuations, our finding of highly elastic on-the-job search effort is particularly relevant.
The next section describes our survey. Section 3 presents our evidence concerning on-the-job
search behavior and job search outcomes by labor force status. Section 4 presents a model of onthe-job search with endogenous search effort and discusses its quantitative implications. Section
5 concludes.

Survey Design and Data

Our data are a supplement to the Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE), administered by the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The SCE is a monthly, nationally-representative survey of
roughly 1,300 individuals that asks respondents their expectations about various aspects of the
economy.3 We designed the supplement ourselves and first administered it in October 2013. We
have administered it annually since then, and present results for a sample that pools the 2013-17
data together. Our supplement asks a broad range of questions on employment status, job search
behavior, and job search outcomes. Demographic data are also available for respondents through
the monthly portion of the SCE survey.
The survey asks a variety of questions that are tailored to an individual’s employment status
and job search behavior. For the employed, the survey asks questions about their wages, hours,
3

See Armantier et al. (2017) for a description of the survey design of the SCE. The survey draws from a
nationally-representative sample of households. Respondents are paid to complete the survey online. They remain
in the sample rotation for 12 months. Armantier et al. (2017) report an initial survey response rate of 54 percent,
with response rates in subsequent months ranging between 59 and 72 percent. They also report that the sample
closely mirrors the demographics of the American Community Survey. We also evaluate the representativeness of
the sample with a comparison to the Current Population Survey in Table 1.

benefits, and the type of work that they do, including questions on the characteristics of their
workplace. For the non-employed, regardless of whether they are unemployed or out of the labor
force, the survey asks a range of detailed questions on their most recent employment spell and
their reasons for non-employment. The survey also asks questions related to the type of nonemployment, including those related to retirement, school enrollment status, and any temporary
layoff. It also asks individuals about their prior work history. This includes detailed information
about the preceding job of the currently employed.
Regardless of employment status, the survey asks all individuals if they have searched for work
within the last four weeks, and if they have not searched, whether or not they would accept a job if
one was offered to them. Among the employed, the survey distinguishes between those searching
for new work and those searching for a job in addition to their current one. For individuals who
have searched or would at least be willing to accept a new job if offered, the survey asks a series
of questions relating to their job search (if any), including the reasons for their decision to (not)
search. It then asks an exhaustive set of questions on the types of effort exerted when seeking
new work (e.g., updating resumes, searching online, contacting employers directly). It also asks
about the number of job applications completed within the last four weeks and the number of
employer contacts and job offers received. It probes further to see how those contacts and offers
came about, i.e., whether they were the result of traditional search methods or whether they came
about through a referral or an unsolicited employer contact. For those who received an offer,
including any offers within the last six months, the survey asks about a range of characteristics
of the job offer, including the wage offered, the expected hours, its benefits, as well as the type of
work to be done and the characteristics of the employer. It also asks what led, or may lead, the
respondent to accept or reject the offer, and asks a range of questions about whether there was
any bargaining with either the current or future employer. Since only a fraction of respondents
in our sample report a job offer in the months leading up to the survey, we ask those who are
currently employed a range of additional, retrospective questions about the search process that
led to their current job.
Many of the survey questions follow a format similar to the Current Population Survey (CPS),
with some notable differences. The survey identifies the labor force status of respondents at
several different points in their employment history: at the time of the survey, at the time of their
7

hiring (if currently employed), and at the time of their job offer (if they reported receiving one).
We also impute a labor force status for individuals four weeks prior to the survey. Our ability
to identify labor force status at these different points allows us to deal with time aggregation
and related issues when comparing the search and job-finding behavior of the employed and
non-employed.
We define a respondent’s labor force status at the time of the survey in a manner similar to
the CPS, but because we ask about search effort more broadly than the CPS, we can generate two
measures of unemployment. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) definition classifies someone
as unemployed if they “do not have a job, have actively looked for work in the prior four weeks,
and are currently available for work.” Those on temporary layoff are also included regardless
of search effort or availability. We employ the same definition, but due to the skip logic of the
CPS survey design, there are some non-employed in the CPS who are never asked whether they
searched for work. These are primarily retired individuals who state that they do not want a job
(and are therefore assumed to be unavailable for work). Our survey, however, captures search
effort regardless of whether a non-employed individual states that they want work. We define a
respondent’s labor force status at the time of the survey using the broader “job search” definition
of unemployment since we aim to capture overall search activity and its effectiveness within the
aggregate economy. In online Appendix A, however, we show that we obtain similar results using
the BLS definition.4
At the time of their hiring or receipt of a job offer, we identify individuals as either employed or
non-employed. The survey allows for some greater disaggregation of these labor force statuses and
we obtain results similar to those in our main analyses when using the more detailed definitions.5
4

The difference in definitions is that the “job search” definition includes non-employed individuals who stated
that they actively searched and are available, while the stricter “BLS definition” includes only those who additionally state that they want work. The results in the appendix show that those included in the broader “job search”
definition represent about 10 percent of those considered out of the labor force under the BLS definition. Given
the well-known observation that even individuals who have not searched and state that they are not available for
work transition from nonparticipation to employment in the CPS, we view our broader “job search” definition of
unemployment as a reasonable one.
5
Specifically, the labor force status at the time of hiring distinguishes between those who quit from a previous
job and those who lost their job immediately prior to starting the current job. The majority of the employed quit
from their current job, so the results for this group are very similar to those reported in our analysis. The labor
force status at the time of job offer distinguishes between those who were employed either full-time or part-time at
the time of the offer. Most individuals were employed full-time, and consequently their results are similar to what
we report in our analysis. The vast majority of the non-employed under both definitions report actively searching.

Notes: Estimates come from authors’ tabulations from the SCE Job Search Supplement and the Current
Population Survey (CPS) for data pooled across October 2013 through 2017. Both samples are for heads
of household ages 18 to 64. Job search definition of unemployment includes all non-employed who actively
searched and are available for work, regardless of reporting whether they want work. Standard errors are
in parentheses.

We also impute a labor force status four weeks prior to the survey for individuals using a range of
their responses on employment status, job tenure, non-employment duration, job offer incidence
and timing, etc. We detail our imputation methodology in online Appendix B. Having a labor
force status for individuals one month prior to the survey is useful for when we apply our empirical
findings to the model because the model characterizes a job seeker’s search behavior using their
labor force status prior to exerting search effort or receiving any job offers.6
Our analysis uses a sample from the SCE of individuals aged 18 to 64 pooled across the 201317 surveys. This provides just under 4,700 observations. Individuals are only in the SCE for,
6

We evaluate the performance of our measure of labor force status along several dimensions in the online
appendix. We also merge the SCE labor market module to the SCE monthly survey, which does allow for some
longitudinal analysis, and use the labor market status from the most recent monthly survey data available for a
given individual, in either September or August of the same year. The results using prior labor force status from
the SCE monthly survey are very similar. See Table B2 in the appendix.

at most, one year, so our sample is a panel of repeated cross sections rather than longitudinal.
Our survey does not ask the self-employed about job search, so the self-employed are generally
excluded by construction throughout the job search portions of our analysis. Table 1 presents
basic summary statistics for our analysis sample and a comparable sample using the same months
of data from the CPS. The demographic makeup of the samples have some notable differences,
which are discussed in more detail by Armentier et al. (2016). Notably, the SCE sample overrepresents white, married, and older individuals. Since these individuals tend to have greater
labor force attachment, the SCE also has a higher employment-to-population ratio and labor
force participation rate, and a somewhat lower unemployment rate (under its comparable BLS
definition) than its CPS counterpart. Consequently, we control for differences in demographics
where appropriate in our analysis, and report a replication of all of our empirical results that
control for observable characteristics in online Appendix C. These results differ little from those
reported in the main text. It is also worth noting that including the additional job seekers in the
“job search” definition of unemployment increases the unemployment rate considerably, from 4.5
percent to 6.8 percent, suggesting that the BLS definition of unemployment misses some search
activity in the economy.
In addition to our main sample, we also focus on a subsample of all individuals who received
a job offer within the last six months. By construction, some of these offers will reflect the
respondent’s current job, which we identify through a separate question in the survey. After
removing offers with only partial data, the sample has 1,054 observations. We use this sample to
examine a range of job offer characteristics, including the offer wage distribution, as well as the
characteristics of accepted job offers. Note that we first ask respondents whether they received
any offer in the last month, and only if not, do we ask about offers received in the last 6 months.
Thus the data allow us to determine the monthly offer rate.

Evidence

We now turn to our empirical analysis. We can summarize our main findings as follows: (i) the
employed frequently engage in on-the-job search and the intensity of on-the-job search declines
with the current wage; (ii) employed job seekers search less than the unemployed but receive just

10

as many offers, implying that their search is more effective per unit of effort; (iii) the employed
receive better offers with higher wages and benefits, even after controlling for their observable
characteristics, but despite receiving higher-quality offers, the employed are less likely to accept
them.

3.1

Extensive and Intensive Margins of Job Search

We begin with evidence on the basic characteristics of individual job search effort. It is useful to
analyze the extensive and intensive margins of job search separately since the distribution of total
search effort along both dimensions is informative for thinking about the efficiency of job search.7
Table 2 reports the incidence of job search by labor force status at the time of the survey interview,
which we interpret as the extensive margin of job search. By definition, all unemployed, save for
those on temporary layoff, search. Since we employ a search-based definition of unemployment,
only a minimal amount of those out of the labor force engage in search.8 Among the employed,
over 21 percent can be classified as searchers regardless of the criteria we employ to define job
search. Over 22 percent of the employed looked for work in the last four weeks, with 21 percent
applying to at least one job and a similar amount searching at least once in the last seven days.
Around 22 percent of those searching on the job report looking for only part-time jobs. Among
the employed, 36 percent of those actively searching (representing 9 percent of all employed)
report only looking for an additional job, with no intention of leaving their current job.
According to our survey responses, dissatisfaction with pay and benefits is the main reason
for on-the-job search, with 55 percent of employed searchers indicating it as a reason for search.
Other important reasons include dissatisfaction with job duties (46 percent), poor utilization
of one’s skills or experience (36 percent), or simply ”wanting a change” (34 percent). Only 15
percent of the employed reported that they searched because they had been given advance notice
or otherwise expected to lose their job. This is consistent with the notion that workers move to
more productive, better paid jobs through job-to-job transitions.
Empirical evidence on the incidence of on-the-job search is scarce and mostly comes from
outdated surveys, so it is hard to provide a good comparison for our estimates of search intensity.
7

We borrow this distinction from the well-established literature on labor supply.
By both the “job search” definition and the BLS definition of unemployment, no one outside of the labor force
is available for work.

Notes: Estimates come from authors’ tabulations from the October 2013-17 waves of the SCE Job Search
Supplement, for all individuals aged 18-64, by labor force status. Standard errors are in parentheses.

The American Time Use Survey (ATUS) is a recent, timely survey that measures time spent
on job search, but there are reasons to believe that the ATUS understates job search intensity,
particularly for the employed. First, the survey is based on a time diary for a single day, so it may
miss intermittent search activity. Second, the time diary only captures time spent on primary
activities. If the employed literally search while on the job, then it would be a secondary activity
and not captured by the ATUS. In our online Appendix A.2, we compare the estimates of time
spent looking for work from the ATUS to our estimates from the SCE. ATUS data pooled over
the 2013-2017 period suggest that, on average, only around 0.6 percent of the employed actively
search for work. The corresponding fraction is only 16.5 percent for the unemployed, revealing
the difficulty of comparing daily diary-based measures with traditional surveys.9 The ATUS
data suggest that the employed only spend about 0.8 minutes per day looking for work, while the

comprehensive comparison of the SCE and ATUS measures of job search activity.

unemployed spend 26.7 minutes per day looking for work, implying that on-the-job search is only
about 3 percent as intensive as search while unemployed. In contrast, we find that 21.3 percent
of the employed and 97.4 percent of the unemployed searched in the last seven days in the SCE.
Furthermore, the total reported time spent searching in the SCE implies that on-the-job search is
10 percent as intensive as unemployed search. This is more than triple the ATUS implication and
suggests that the ATUS misses a great deal of on-the-job search because it is likely a secondary
activity for many ATUS respondents. Such a misspecification of relative search intensity can have
considerable aggregate implications, made clear in models such as Moscarini and Postel-Vinay
(2019) and discussed in our Appendix A.2.
The SCE estimates are more in line with older studies of job search activity that do not use
diary-based information. For example, according to Black (1980), around 14 percent of white
workers and 10 percent of black workers reported on-the-job search in the 1972 interview of the
Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). Similarly, Blau and Robins (1990) report that employed
search spells represent about 10 percent of all employment spells in the Employment Opportunity
Pilot Project (EOPP) in 1980. Unfortunately, the main source of labor market statistics for the
U.S., the CPS, does not ask questions about job search to employed individuals, but its recent
Computer and Internet Use Supplements asked all respondents, regardless of their labor force
status, whether they used the internet to search for a job in the past six months. Around 28
percent of the employed reported using the internet for job search in the last six months in the
2015 survey. We also asked a question about whether an individual searched in the last twelve
months. Around 45 percent employed reported searching in the last twelve months using any
active search method, including online job search. Given that we designed our survey to cast a
wide net to identify any “search activity,” we find our estimates of search intensity reasonable.
Table 3 reports the amount of effort spent on the job search process, the intensive margin
of job search. We categorize the employed by whether or not they actively looked for work.10
This distinction emphasizes the stark differences in search activity among the employed. The
unemployed send substantially more job applications and dedicate more hours to search than the
other groups. They put in roughly twice as much effort as the employed that actively look for
work. On average, unemployed workers spent around 9.2 hours per week on job search and sent

The estimates exclude the self-employed.

8.5 applications in the last four weeks. These findings are remarkably similar to the statistics
reported by Barron and Gilley (1981), who use a special survey of the unemployed in the CPS
from May 1976. They find that the typical unemployed individual contacted over three employers
per week and spent approximately eight and two-thirds hours per week to make such contacts.
Figure 1 shows the distributions of search time within the last seven days and the number of
applications sent within the last four weeks for employed and unemployed job seekers, conditional
on searching in the last four weeks.11 About 44 percent of the employed and about 31 percent
of the unemployed apply to either one or two jobs. About 11 percent of employed job seekers
sent more than 10 applications, while just over 26 percent of the unemployed sent more than 10
applications. The right panel of the figure shows the distribution of search time. The differences
between the employed and unemployed are more pronounced when we consider the distribution
of search time. Over 42 percent of employed job seekers report searching for one hour or less
within the last seven days, but over 81 percent of the unemployed searched for two hours or
more. Moreover, searching for longer than 10 hours a week is relatively more common among
11

Recall from Table 2 that around 22 percent of the employed report actively searching. The remainder is
excluded from the analysis to provide a more relevant comparison of distributions.

the unemployed than the employed (37 percent vs. 13 percent). Interestingly, 25 percent of the
employed and 13 percent of the unemployed did not search at all within the last seven days.
This observation highlights the intermittent nature of search effort and reinforces our view that
the ATUS, which is based on a time diary reported at the daily frequency, greatly understates
the extensive margin of job search. Given that the employed are likely to search as a secondary
activity (and therefore not report it in the ATUS), the bias is likely to be more pronounced for
the employed.

3.2

Search Intensity and Wages

A key implication of related job ladder models is that workers near the bottom of the job ladder
search harder for a better job while those near the top of the job ladder do not search as hard since
their chances of obtaining an offer better than their current job are smaller (see, for example,
Christensen et al., 2005; Bagger and Lentz, 2019, and Moscarini and Postel-Vinay, 2019). While
this relationship is at the heart of job-ladder models, one could not measure it empirically with
a direct, reliable measure of search effort until the development of our survey.12 Measurement
error and unobserved worker heterogeneity in wages make it difficult to assess the exact position
12

An exception is Mueller (2010), who documents a negative relationship in the ATUS data, though it is subject
to the caveats on measuring on-the-job search with the ATUS that we noted earlier.

Notes: The table reports the estimated relationship from an OLS regression between the dependent variables listed
in each column and the (log) real current wage for all employed individuals in the October 2013-17 waves of the
SCE Job Search Supplement. “Active Search” equals one if an individual actively looked for work in the last four
weeks. “Applied” equals one if an individual applied to at least one job in the last four weeks. “Applications”
refers to the number of applications sent in the last four weeks. “Search Time” refers to the number of hours spent
looking for work in the last seven days. Regressions are sample weighted and control for gender, age, age squared,
four education dummies, four race dummies, a homeownership dummy, marital status, marital status×male, the
number of children aged 5 and younger, and fixed effects for state and year. Standard errors are in parentheses.

of a worker on the job ladder, but a worker’s wage relative to her peers with similar observable
characteristics should still provide a useful proxy. Therefore, we estimate a linear regression of the
relationship between a worker’s search behavior and her current wage controlling for observable
worker characteristics. Our estimates are in Table 4 and show that workers with lower wages in
their current job are more likely to engage in search regardless of the definition of search activity
that we use. In addition, the overall intensity of search activity, measured by the total number of
applications in the last four weeks or the total hours spent searching the last seven days, is higher
for workers with lower wages.13 The estimates in the right columns of Table 4 imply a search
effort-wage elasticity of -0.36 using applications sent and -0.52 using hours spent searching.
We also explore potential non-linearities in the search-wage relationship. Figure 2 shows the
estimates from a locally weighted regression (LOWESS) between the different measures of search
effort and the residualized current wage, i.e., the wage conditional on the controls from Table 4.
The figure highlights the negative wage-search effort relationship in Table 4 for both the total
number of applications and hours of search, and illustrates the quantitatively large decline in
search effort from low to high residual wages.14 There is some nonlinearity in the relationship for
low wages, but otherwise the relationship is close to linear. These plots provide direct evidence
13

In results available on request, we report the effect of various observables on the incidence and intensity of
search. Females, more educated workers, and workers who identify as black and Hispanic search harder.
14
Figures C1 and C2 in the Appendix show that similar patterns hold for measures of the incidence of search as
well as when we do not control for observable characteristics in the wage.

models with endogenous search effort mentioned earlier. We will return to this topic in the model
section.

3.3

Search Outcomes by Labor Force Status

We have shown that there is considerable job search activity among the employed. We now move
on to show how search effort translates into employer contacts, job offers, and new job matches.
The fact that our data contain exhaustive information on both search effort and search outcomes
at different stages of the process puts us in a unique position to assess the relative effectiveness
of employed versus unemployed search.
The top panel of Table 5 reports search outcomes by labor force status at the time of the
survey and shows that those who are employed and looking for work receive the greatest number
of employer contacts and interviews, and nearly the most offers, despite the fact that their search
effort is about half that of the unemployed. They also receive the most unsolicited employer
contacts. These are employer contacts that did not result from a job seeker’s search efforts.
Overall, those searching on the job receive about 5 percent more contacts and 14 percent fewer
job offers than the unemployed. Those who are employed but not looking for work receive nearly

17

one-quarter as many contacts and offers as the unemployed despite exerting no search effort.
They receive about one-quarter of the offers of those searching on the job as well.
A potential concern with our estimates is that the outcomes are based on retrospective questions and the respondents’ current labor force status may not reflect their labor force status
at the time of the outcome. Non-random job acceptances by those unemployed at the time of
a job offer can create a selection issue.15 We address this issue by constructing a measure of
labor force status for the prior month using a wide range of survey questions from the SCE labor
supplement. In the middle panel of Table 5, we report offer outcomes by the prior month’s labor
force status. The results show that the fraction with at least one offer over the last four weeks
decreases slightly for the employed, from 11.7 percent to 10.6 percent, but increases substantially
for the unemployed, from 22.3 percent to 34.2 percent, when considering labor force status in the
prior month instead of at the time of the survey, reflecting the selection of some unemployed at
the time of the job offer into employment by the time of the survey. Another concern is that a
substantial fraction of employed workers only seek an additional job. Job-to-job transitions, as
measured in the CPS and most other household surveys, only capture changes in an individual’s
main job. Nearly all models of labor market search only consider this type of job-to-job transition
as well. In the bottom panel of Table 5, we report offer outcomes ignoring the offers of those
who reported only looking for additional work. The fraction of the employed receiving at least
one offer falls to 8.1 percent in this case. We use this estimate of the offer rate in our model
calibration below.
It is possible that some individuals simply do not pursue offers that they are likely to reject.
In this case, the job offers we observe in the data would be censored. Most importantly, this type
of censoring could be correlated with employment status, since the employed may be more likely
to prefer their current labor market situation. To address this issue, our survey asks respondents
whether a potential employer was willing to make an offer but the respondent indicated that he or
she was not interested. We label these offers as unrealized rejected offers as respondents rejected
these offers even before a formal offer was made. We indeed find that these unrealized offers are
more common for the employed. Among those who did not report a formal offer over the last
15

This selection issue is similar to the time-aggregation issue that plagues calculations of the separation rate
using CPS data.

four weeks, 4.4 percent of the employed indicated that they rejected or did not pursue such an
unrealized offer, compared to only 2.8 percent of the unemployed. The middle panel of Table
5 reports the fraction of individuals who received at least one offer, including these unrealized
offers. Accounting for unrealized offers raises the fraction receiving a job offer to 15.0 percent for
the employed (12.3 percent when excluding offers for additional work) and to 37.0 percent for the
unemployed. The share of unrealized offers among all offers is thus substantially higher among
the employed (28 percent) than among the unemployed (8 percent).
Table 6 reports the acceptance rate for offers received within the last four weeks by labor force
status in the prior month. The results show that the unemployed are much more likely to accept
a given offer, with 45 to 49 percent of their offers accepted, depending on whether we include their
best formal offers, or their best offer including any unrealized offers in the denominator of the
acceptance rate. In contrast, the employed accept 20 to 33 percent of their offers, depending on
the measure used. Note, however, that despite accepting a substantially higher fraction of their
job offers than the employed, the unemployed still reject nearly half of all offers received. This is
notable because most models of labor market search imply that, in equilibrium, the unemployed
accept all job offers. Our evidence suggests that a sizable number of unsuitable offers do in fact
exist. In our calibration, we focus on the acceptance rates of the best offers, excluding offers for
additional work, which is 30.9 percent for the employed and 49.3 percent for the unemployed.
Finally, we present the distribution of search effort and search outcomes across the differ20

ent labor force categories. Examining these distributions provides another way of assessing the
relative efficiency of employed and unemployed job seekers. Table 7 reports the distribution of
respondents, job applications, and job search outcomes by labor force status. The unemployed
make up just over 6 percent of our sample, but account for nearly 40 percent of all job applications sent. At the same time, they only receive 16 percent of all offers made. In stark contrast,
the employed who report not looking for work send no applications by construction but account
for nearly 33 percent of all employer contacts and receive around 33 percent of all job offers.
This is due, in part, to the fact that they also account for 47 percent of all unsolicited employer
contacts and 57 percent of all unsolicited offers. Those actively searching on the job account
for another 42 percent of all job offers. Thus, the job search behavior of the unemployed can
be characterized by high effort, but relatively low returns in terms of employer contacts and job
offers. The employed, on the other hand, do fairly well regardless of whether they are actually
looking for work. Though the unemployed are seemingly less effective in their job search efforts,
they are also more likely to accept the offers that they do receive.

3.4

Search Efficiency by Labor Force Status

Having detailed data on all stages of job search allows us to quantify the relative efficiency of
the employed in job search, which is a key input for search and matching models with on the job
search. Let the offer arrival rate be λi for a worker with labor force status i, where i ∈ {e, u}
denotes the employed or unemployed, respectively. Let it depend on search effort, s, according

21

to λi (s) = αi + βi s, where αi represents unsolicited offers and βi is search efficiency, defined as
the offers generated per unit of search effort. This generalized specification applies to a broad
range of labor search models going back to Mortensen (1977) and detailed in Pissarides (2000).16
Thus, our data and generalized offer arrival rate allow a calculation of relative search efficiency
for a broad range of search models.
We define the relative search efficiency of the employed as the ratio, βe /βu . Before we quantify
this measure, however, it is useful to illustrate how wrong an estimate one obtains from data
available prior to our survey. The most common way of imputing search efficiency is to use
data on transition rates.17 In our data, transition rates are the product of the offer arrival rate
and the job acceptance rate. Let EE denote the job-to-job transition rate and U E denote the
unemployment-to-employment transition rate. Applying this calculation, we get:
βe /βu =

(0.081)(0.309)
0.025
EE
=
=
= 0.148.
UE
(0.342)(0.493)
0.168

The underlying assumptions in this calculation are that the employed and unemployed exert
the same level of search intensity and have identical job acceptance rates—neither of which are
supported by our data. The calculation implies that the employed are only 15 percent as efficient
as the unemployed in job search, or inversely, that the unemployed are 6.8 times more efficient
at search.18
It is arguably better to infer search efficiency from offer arrival rates alone, which allows for
differences in acceptance rates but still assumes that search intensity is equal for the employed
and unemployed. In this case, the calculation of relative search efficiency is:
βe /βu =

0.081
λe (s)
=
= 0.237.
λu (s)
0.342

The calculation implies that the employed are now 24 percent as efficient as the unemployed at
job search, or that the unemployed are 4.2 times as efficient.
Since we can measure the search effort directly, and can identify unsolicited and unrealized
offers, we are in a unique position to disentangle the differences in search efficiency from search
16

Exceptions are offer arrival rates that allow for substitutability between search effort and market conditions,
as in Shimer (2004) and Mukoyama, Patterson, and Şahin (2018).
17
See Eeckhout and Lindenlaub (2018), Moscarini and Postel-Vinay (2019).
18
Transition rates from the CPS suggest an even higher level of search efficiency for the unemployed over this
period. In the CPS, the job-finding rate of the unemployed is 24.0 percent while the job-to-job transition rate is 1.9
to 2.3 percent (depending on the estimation method used, see Fujita et al., 2019), implying that the unemployed
are 10.4 to 12.6 times more efficient at search than the employed.

22

effort. Now consider the relative search efficiency in the generalized formulation for the offer
arrival rate, λi (s) = αi + βi s and add unrealized offers to the observed offer arrival rate assuming
that these offers are part of search efficiency. In this case, we subtract unsolicited offers and
calculate the relative search efficiency as

This calculation shows that taking account of differences in search intensity (measured here as job
applications sent), unsolicited offers, and unrealized offers paints a very different picture of search
efficiency. The employed are now four times more efficient than the unemployed at job search.
If we were to interpret the receipt of unsolicited job offers as part of search efficiency, it would
imply an even higher relative search efficiency of the employed, increasing the estimate further,
to 4.49, since the employed receive a higher share of these as well. Therefore, using our data to
gain a proper estimate of relative search efficiency shows that the unemployed have an incentive
to accept low wage offers, since, once employed, they will be able to search more efficiently while
on the job and therefore move up the job ladder more quickly to better job offers. One would
wrongly get the opposite implication if they relied on an estimate of search efficiency implied by
transition rates alone.

Characteristics of Job Offers and Accepted Jobs

The employed are more effective at generating job offers, but our evidence thus far is silent on
whether the employed receive better offers than the unemployed. We examine this next. Our
survey asks individuals about any offers they received in the last four weeks. For those who
received no offer within the last four weeks, it probes further to elicit information on any offers
received within the last six months. The survey also elicits the respondent’s labor force status
at the time of the job offer. It asks a variety of questions about the characteristics of the job
offer, including information about the search and bargaining process. It also asks if the offer was
accepted (and if it represents their current job).
Table 8 presents the characteristics of best job offers received within the last six months
by labor force status (employed vs. non-employed) at the time of the job offer.19 Note that

Starting in 2014, we added a question to the survey that identifies those who searched prior to the receipt

Notes: Figures report kernel density estimates of residual log(real wage offer) by labor force status after
controlling for observable worker and job characteristics. Estimates are for all (best) job offers received within
the last six months by individuals in the October 2013-17 waves of the SCE Job Search Supplement.

72 percent of job offers in our sample go to those who were employed at the time of the offer.
The results consistently show that the employed also receive much better job offers than the
non-employed. Unconditionally, the employed receive wage offers that are about 36 log points
(44 percent) higher than the wage offers of the non-employed.20 Even after conditioning on the
observable characteristics of the worker and the job offer, the employed enjoy wage offers that
are 19 log points (21 percent) higher than the wage offers of the non-employed.21 The left panel
of Figure 3 shows that, even after accounting for these controls, the distribution of wage offers
for the employed stochastically dominates the distribution of wage offers for the non-employed.
The middle panel of Table 8 shows that job offers received by the employed are superior on
other margins as well. Their hours are 13 log points higher, and they are 21 percentage points
more likely to include at least some benefits such as retirement pay or health insurance. The
employed are nearly 60 percent more likely to have received their offer through an unsolicited
of the job offer. Most of the non-employed report actively searching, and in unreported results, we find that the
residual wage offer differential that we document is even larger if we restrict the non-employed to those who were
searching prior to the job offer.
20
The offer wage, as well as all other wages in our analysis, refers to the real hourly wage. Respondents report
their nominal earnings as an hourly wage, or as a measure of weekly or annual earnings. In the latter cases, we
measure the wage as earnings per hour, based on the reported usual hours worked. We convert all wages used into
real terms using the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
21
Our conditional estimates of the offered wage and the subsequent accepted wage control for worker and job
characteristics, as well as state and year fixed effects. Our worker controls include sex, age, age squared, marital
status, marital status×sex, education, race, homeowner status, and number of household children. Our firm and
job controls are the two-digit occupation of the job and the size of the offering firm. We report estimates of the
other job offer characteristics that control for observable characteristics in online Appendix C.

Notes: Estimates come from authors’ tabulations from the October 2013-17 waves of the SCE Job Search Supplement, for individuals aged 18-64, excluding the self-employed, with at least one job offer in the last six months.
Observable characteristics controlled for in the conditional wage estimates include fixed effects for survey year
and state as well as a vector of demographic controls: sex, age, age squared, four education categories, four race
categories, a dummy for homeownership, the number of children under age 6 in the household, marital status, and
marital status×sex. They also include the two-digit SOC occupation of the job and six categories of the firm size
of the potential employer. Standard errors are in parentheses.

contact. The employed and non-employed are roughly equally likely to have had a “good idea” of
what the job paid prior to receiving the offer. Potentially contributing to the differences in offer
wages between the two groups, the employed are significantly more likely to bargain over their
offers, with 38 percent of their offers involving some bargaining, compared to 26 percent for the

25

non-employed.22 Counter-offers by the current employer, defined as anything from matching the
outside offer to offering a promotion, pay raise, or some added job benefit, occurred for about 12
percent of the employed who received an offer from an outside firm.
Despite their relatively poor job offers, the non-employed are nearly one-and-a-half times
more likely than the employed to accept a job offer, with 51 percent of offers accepted by the
non-employed versus 35 percent by the employed. These acceptance rates are very close to those
we obtain using the prior month’s labor force status. A primary reason the non-employed are
more likely to accept their relatively poor job offers is a perceived lack of alternative options–
about 27 percent of the non-employed cite a lack of other alternatives as the main reason for
accepting an offer, while only 8 percent of the employed cite that as their primary reason. The
right panel of Figure 3 shows that, even after controlling for observed worker and job characteristics, the accepted wage distribution of the employed stochastically dominates the accepted wage
distribution of the non-employed.
The bottom panel of Table 8 reports prior-job wages, with and without controls for observable
characteristics. The prior-job wage is a rough proxy for unobserved heterogeneity. For the
employed, it is the wage earned prior to their current job, while for the non-employed, it is the
wage earned in their most recent job. Unconditionally, the prior wages of the employed are 12 log
points (13 percent) higher, but conditional on observables the difference is essentially zero. That
is, despite our finding of a large differential in offered wages by labor force status, we find almost
no difference in residual prior wages. In our model calibration, we use the negligible residual
wage differential in prior wages to discipline the degree of unobserved heterogeneity in the model.

3.6

Accounting for Differences in Job Offers

We can dig deeper into the wage offer differential between the employed and non-employed using
responses to a rich set of questions from our survey. Table 8 shows that observable worker and
job characteristics explain 46 percent of the raw wage offer difference. Differences in education,
occupation, and age are the most important observables in accounting for this difference. The remaining differential may arise simply because we cannot control for differences that are observed
22

These estimates are consistent with Hall and Krueger (2012), who find that around a third of all workers
engaged in some bargaining over their pay with their current employer.

26

by employers but are unobserved in our data. For example, workers may differ in unobserved
characteristics such as communication or time-management skills. Those with better skills of
this nature would be more likely to be employed and earn a higher wage. This creates a selection effect that naturally generates a wage gap between the job offers received by the employed
versus the non-employed. An individual’s prior work history can provide a useful proxy for such
unobserved heterogeneity because it reflects repeated labor market outcomes determined at least
partly by their unobserved skills. Our survey has detailed questions that allow us to control for
an individual’s labor force history over the previous five years. As Table 9 shows, controlling for
the fraction of the last five years that an individual was employed reduces the residual wage offer
gap from 0.194 to 0.132. When we additionally control for the share of the last five years spent
unemployed and the share spent as a student, the difference goes down somewhat more to 0.127,
implying that labor force history can account for an additional 19 percent of the wage offer gap.
Even after these controls, about one-third of the unconditional wage gap remains unexplained.
As we noted earlier, prior wages of workers can also provide additional information regarding
workers’ unobserved skills. We add the prior wage of workers as an additional control in Table 9.
We find that the prior wage does not close the gap. On the contrary, the gap widens. We discuss
this issue below in the model section.
The remaining gap may also arise because of differences in the job search process between
the employed and non-employed. Employed workers may have better access to more rewarding
job search channels (see, for example, Arbex, O’Dey, and Wiczer, 2016). Our empirical analysis
shows that the employed are more likely to receive an offer through an unsolicited contact than
the non-employed. If these informal offers represent higher-quality jobs, then the higher incidence
of unsolicited offers should also contribute to the wage offer gap. Alternatively, non-employed
workers may be more likely to pursue jobs with lower wages but better non-wage benefits. In
the last row of Table 9, we control for how a job offer came about using dummies for whether
the offer was the result of a direct contact by the worker, whether an intermediary (such as an
employment agency) was involved, whether it was the result of a referral, or whether the offer was
unsolicited. We also control for the (log) hours of the job offer and the incidence of any benefits
(categorized into health, retirement, or other benefits). These controls result in little change in

Notes: Estimates come from authors’ tabulations from the October 2013-17 waves of the SCE Job Search Supplement, for individuals aged 18-64, excluding the self-employed, with at least one job offer in the last six months.
See note to Table 8 for the included observable characteristics. Employment history controls for the fraction of
the prior five years spent employed. Labor force history additionally controls for the fraction of the last five years
spent unemployed or in school. The (log) real prior wage is the wage of the previous job for the employed and the
most recent job for the non-employed. Additional job controls include (log) hours and dummies for the incidence
of health, retirement, or other benefits. Controls for how the job offer came about include dummies for whether it
was through a direct employer contact, an intermediary, a referral, or an unsolicited contact. Standard errors are

our estimate of the wage offer differential.23 Thus, while controlling for observable worker and
job characteristics, prior labor force history, and the source of the job offer reduces the offered
wage gap by about two-thirds, a substantial gap between the wages offered to the employed and
non-employed remains.
Another possibility is that human capital depreciates during periods of non-employment. In
this case, the employed and non-employed may have a similar wage (and potentially similar skill
levels) when they separate from their previous job, but the skills of the non-employed depreciate,
leading them to have lower-quality job offers, on average. Accounting for the work history of the
employed and non-employed would reduce the gap. We already showed that controlling for the
previous five-year work history (specifically, the fraction of the prior five years spent employed,
unemployed, etc.) reduces the wage gap from 0.19 to 0.13. This suggests that human capital
depreciation can explain only a limited fraction of the wage offer gap. Moreover, questions about
five-year work histories also capture fixed unobserved differences in worker productivity even in
23

If we re-estimate the last row of Table 9 excluding the prior wage, we obtain a wage offer gap of 0.119.

28

the absence of human capital depreciation.
Finally, the presence of bargaining and counter-offers represents another way the search process can affect the wage offer gap. We find that 38 percent of offers to the employed, while only
26 percent of offers to the non-employed, involved some bargaining between the individual and
the potential employer. In general, a greater propensity to bargain with the potential employer
should increase the reported wage offer, all else equal. Moreover, 12 percent of the employed
with an outside offer received some form of counter-offer from their current employer. While
the latter estimate falls short of the rate of counter-offers in models such as Postel-Vinay and
Robin (2002) and Cahuc, Postel-Vinay, and Robin (2006), it is possible that the threat of such
counter-offers raises the mean wage offers for the employed even when no such offer occurs in
equilibrium. Regardless of its source, any such penalty on job search while unemployed would
imply that the employed and unemployed draw from seemingly different wage offer distributions,
an issue we take up in the next section.

Job Search On and Off the Job: A Theoretical Framework

In this section, we set up a partial equilibrium model of on-the-job search and analyze the
responsiveness of aggregate search effort to changes in the value of employment, a key elasticity
that arises in the presence of search and matching frictions in the labor market. When we calibrate
our model to match the new evidence from our survey, we find a more prominent role for workers’
job search effort than is typically assumed, which provides empirical support for recent papers
such as Eeckhout and Lindenlaub (2019), Moscarini and Postel-Vinay (2019) and Faccini and
Melosi (2019). These studies highlight on-the-job-search behavior as a driving force of business
cycles or as a propagation mechanism of aggregate shocks. Moreover, our model provides insights
on the implications of efficient on-the-job search and the employed wage offer premium, and does
remarkably well in generating a plausible amount of frictional wage dispersion.

4.1

Framework

Our model builds on earlier models of on-the-job search with endogenous search effort in the
spirit of Christensen et al. (2005) and Hornstein et al. (2011), with four important extensions

29

to accommodate the salient features of our survey.24 First, we allow for differences in search
efficiency by employment status. Second, we allow the employed and unemployed to draw from
potentially different wage offer distributions. Third, we allow workers to differ in ex ante productivity. Fourth, we allow for censoring of potential job offers by workers—that is, we allow
workers to reject offers before they are realized in line with a question that we directly asked our
survey respondents.
In the model, workers are either employed or unemployed. We denote their employment status
with the subscript i ∈ {e, u}. Workers are ex ante heterogeneous in their productivity, x. This
reflects the unobserved heterogeneity that remains in our data after controlling for observable
characteristics. Time is discrete and its discount rate is r.
As in our exercise on search efficiency, individuals receive a job offer with probability λi (s) =
i
αi + βi s, where s ∈ [0, 1−α
βi ] is the endogenously-chosen level of search effort. The constant αi

reflects the probability of an unsolicited offer, which occurs absent any search effort, and the
constant βi reflects search efficiency, i.e., the probability of an offer per unit of search effort.
Both the unsolicited offer rate and search efficiency may vary by employment status.
Search effort has an increasing, convex cost that depends on ex ante worker productivity and
may also vary by employment status. We assume that search costs are proportional to unobserved
productivity, ci (x, s) = xci (s), with c0i , c00i > 0 and ci (0) = c0i (0) = 0. Existing matches end
exogenously at an average rate δ(x), which also depends on ex ante worker productivity. The
piece-rate wage, w, is drawn from a wage offer distribution, Fi (w), which we assume depends on
employment status, is identically distributed across worker types x, and has upper support w̄.
Given this setup, the Bellman equation for the employed is

Richer models with similar features exist, such as Bagger and Lentz (2019). Our model provides a parsimonious
framework to evaluate the quantitative importance of our empirical findings and can be extended to accommodate
richer features.

for the potential separation to either a new job or unemployment and the last term reflects the
expected value of a separation to unemployment. It is easy to show that the value of employment
is increasing in the wage and derive the first order condition for an employed worker.25 Since
the cost of search effort is increasing and convex, search effort will decline with the wage, i.e., as
workers move up the job ladder.
The Bellman equation for the unemployed is similar in structure:

R(x)

and b(x) = bx is the flow value of unemployment.26 The first term on the right-

hand side reflects the flow value net of search costs and the second term on the right-hand side
reflects the continuation value of unemployment, accounting for the probability of finding a job.
The unemployed of type x have an optimal reservation wage, R(x), that solves W (x, R(x)) = U (x)
and represents the wage at which the unemployed are just indifferent between a job that pays
R(x) and unemployment.
Finally, we allow for censoring of job offers. We model censored offers by assuming that job
seekers observe the terms of the offer prior to receiving a formal offer with probability χi , and
do not pursue the offer further (i.e., reject) if the wage is below their reservation wage.27 This
is consistent with our finding in the SCE data that the employed appear to reject many offers
before they are made, on the order of 50 percent of formal offers made, compared to 8 percent
for the unemployed. Note that we do not allow for censoring of unsolicited offers. For a worker
with productivity x and reservation wage Ri , one can thus write
λ̃i (x, Ri ) = αi + βi si (x)(χi (1 − Fi (Ri )) + 1 − χi ),

(3)

where si (x) is the optimal search effort and λi (si (x)) = αi + βi si (x) is the “true” probability of
25

We derive the first-order conditions for both employed and unemployed workers in online Appendix D.
Similar to our assumption for the employed, we posit that the flow value of unemployment net of search costs is
proportional to unobserved productivity, i.e. b(x) − cu (x, s) = (b − cu (s))x. This is consistent with the observations
that job-finding rates differ little by skill group (Mincer, 1991; Elsby, Hobijn and Şahin, 2010) or by prior wages
(Mueller, 2017). It also consistent with our evidence in Appendix Table C2, which shows that controlling for
observable characteristics does little to affect the likelihood of receiving a job offer.
27
Hall and Mueller (2018) introduce censoring of offers in a similar way in their appendix to capture partially
directed search.

receiving an offer, including unrealized offers, λ̃i (x, Ri ) is the probability of receiving a formal
offer, and 1 − Fi (Ri (x)) is the likelihood a potential offer is above the reservation wage threshold,
which is Re = w for the employed and Ru = R(x) for the unemployed.

4.2

Parameterization and Targeted Moments

We calibrate our model to the 2013-2017 period and parameterize our model as follows. We set
its frequency to be monthly and match the monthly discount rate to an annual interest rate of
4 percent. We match most parameters directly to key moments computed using our survey, as
shown in Table 10. Where relevant, we use the moments based on labor force status in the prior
month and search behavior and outcomes that exclude search for an additional job only.
We take the unsolicited offer rates and formal offer rates of the employed and unemployed directly from the estimates in Table 5. We match the average rate of censored offers by employment
status, E(βi si (x)χi Fi (Ri (x))|i), to the average rate of unrealized offers by employment status in
our data. Given that the offer arrival rate is of the form λi (s) = αi + βi s, we can calculate βi
directly from the offer arrival rates, λi (s) and αi , and average search intensity, s, in the data.
We assume a search cost function of the form ci (s) = κi s1+(1/γ) , as in Christensen et al. (2005)
and Hornstein et al. (2011). We calibrate each κi to match the average search effort by labor
force status in Table 3. The high level of search efficiency and low level of search effort among the
employed implies a high cost of search for the employed in our calibration. We set γ to match a
search effort-wage elasticity of -0.36, which is estimated from the empirical relationship implied
from results in Table 4 for applications. This results in a value of 2.8 for γ. This is substantially
higher than what is typically assumed in the literature, which is γ = 1 (i.e., a quadratic cost
function). The estimated elasticity of search hours with respect to the current wage is −0.52,
which implies an even higher estimate of γ. We set γ to 2.8 and present robustness results in
Table D2 and Figure D1 for models with higher levels of γ.
We define the flow value of unemployment as a fraction of the average wage net of average
search costs, z =

b−cu (s)
E(w)−ce (s) ,

and set it to match the average acceptance rate of the unemployed,

implicitly pinning down a value for the parameter b. This allows our model, by construction, to
match their job-finding rate, as both the acceptance rate and the offer rate of the unemployed

are targets in the calibration.28
We parameterize the extent of heterogeneity in our model by assuming that there are 10 types
of workers who differ by a wage-shifting parameter x. The distribution of types approximates a
normal distribution with standard deviation σx over the interval [−3σx , 3σx ]. We parameterize
σx to match the standard deviation of our residual wage offer estimates since our goal is to
quantify the role of unobserved heterogeneity. Specifically, we assume that our observed offered
wage, ỹ, satisfies log(ỹ) = log(y) + log(x) + εy , where log(y) ∼ N (µi , σy ), log(x) ∼ N (0, σx ),
q
and εy ∼ N (0, σεy ) are independently distributed, and thus, σỹ = σy2 + σx2 + σε2y . We assume
that the wage offer distribution is log normal, normalize the mean of the log offered wages to
the unemployed to zero, and calibrate the standard deviation of the wage offer distribution to
be 0.24 as in Hall and Mueller (2018).29 We parameterize the mean of the offer distribution of
the employed to match the gap in residualized wages between the employed and non-employed.
We assume a moderate degree of measurement error equal to 13 percent of the unconditional
28

We could have alternatively assumed a specific value for z, as in Shimer (2005) or Hall and Milgrom (2008),
but we prefer to infer it directly from our data because there is little consensus on the appropriate value for z.
Moreover, our findings on search efficiency have direct implications for the value of z, and our approach allows the
model to speak to these implications.
29
This estimate is close to other estimates of frictional wage dispersion, see, e.g., Low, Meghir, and Pistaferri
(2010) and Tjaden and Wellschmied (2014). We choose this estimate of wage dispersion over one derived from the
SCE data because of the relatively small sample of wage offers that we observe in the SCE data.

variance in offered wages, consistent with Bound and Krueger (1991). Given our calibration of
q
both σε2y and σy2 , we get an estimate for σx = σỹ2 − σy2 − σε2y .
We target the average separation rate to match an unemployment rate of 0.068, which is the
sample average for 2013-2017 in the SCE, but allow separation rates to vary by worker type x in
the calibration. This yields an average separation rate across all types of 0.0123. This is consistent
with the well-known fact that differences in unemployment rates across skill groups are driven
by separations and not job finding. We linearly interpolate the separation rates for the 8 types
between the lowest and highest type, xmin and xmax , and parameterize the difference between
δ(xmin ) and δ(xmax ) by matching the difference in residual prior wages between the employed
and unemployed. Intuitively, as the difference between δ(xmin ) and δ(xmax ) gets larger, there
is greater negative selection among the unemployed, which lowers the average prior wage of the
unemployed. We use an estimate of this difference from Table 8, which reports prior wages for
those who received a job offer in the last six months. The estimated log difference in residual prior
wages within this sample is 0.008, i.e. prior wages are nearly the same between the employed
and unemployed.30
30

If we were to ignore negative selection and set δ(xmin ) = δ(xmax ), the simulation of our model would predict

Before moving on to the results, note that the offer rate and the acceptance rate of the
employed that we target from the SCE data imply a target job-to-job transition rate of 2.5
percent (Table 10). This rate is above the average employer-to-employer transition rate in the
CPS, which is 1.9 percent for our sample period. However, Fujita, Moscarini, and Postel-Vinay
(2019) provide convincing evidence that the CPS understates the job-to-job transition rate during
our sample period. Their corrected measure implies a job-to-job transition rate of 2.3 percent
which is very close to the SCE estimate.

4.3

Model Fit and Micro Implications

The main goal of our quantitative analysis is to analyze the responsiveness of aggregate search
effort to changes in labor market conditions. But first, we highlight the success of our model in
fitting the data and several of its micro implications.
Fit of the Search Effort-Wage Relationship. A key implication of on-the-job search models
with endogenous search effort is that employed workers will reduce their search effort as they climb
the job ladder. We explicitly target the search-wage elasticity, which identifies the elasticity of
search costs with respect to search effort through γ. The evidence in Figure 2 shows that the fit
of the relationship is clearly negative between different measures of search effort and the current
wage of the worker. In Figure 4, we compare the relationship implied by a simulation of our
model to its counterpart from our survey data. The model produces a good fit to the data with
the model-implied relationship generally lying within the 95 percent confidence interval. Note
that the fit is particularly good for applications, which is our target measure of search effort.
Adjusting γ to further improve the fit in Figure 4 would imply an even higher value for γ. This
would make search effort even more responsive to labor market conditions, strengthening one of
our key findings.31 Overall, we view this as clear evidence in support of models with endogenous
search effort.
Wage Offer Premium of the Employed. In Subsection 3.6, we examined how much of the
wage offer differential between the employed and unemployed could be accounted for by a rich set
that prior wages are higher for the unemployed by about 10 log points. This is because the employed tend to
transition up the wage ladder, so their prior wages tend to be from jobs further down on the wage ladder, while
the prior wages of the unemployed are from jobs prior to a separation and thus further up on the wage ladder.

See Appendix Figure D1 and Appendix Table D2 for results with higher levels of γ.

of controls. We match this differential in our model by incorporating unobserved heterogeneity
and censoring, and calibrating them to match the moments in the SCE data. This allows us to
decompose the differential into three parts: the part due to unobserved heterogeneity, the part
due to censoring of the wage offer distribution, and a residual, unexplained component. Panel
I of Table 12 shows that the model attributes 15.3 log points (78 percent) of the 19.4 log point
residual wage offer differential to unobserved heterogeneity. This represents 42 percent of the 36.2
log point unconditional wage offer differential. The contribution of censoring is small because
job offers are concentrated among employed workers who are at the bottom of the ladder. The
exogenous, residual offer differential is estimated to be positive but only at 4 log points. This
represents 21 percent of the residual wage offer gap and 11 percent of the unconditional wage offer
gap. The important takeaway is that selection into unemployment by workers with relatively low
unobserved productivity accounts for a large fraction of the wage offer differential observed in
the data, leaving only a small unexplained part.
Additionally, our model predicts a correlation between ex ante unobserved heterogeneity and
labor force histories, which can provide guidance for addressing unobserved heterogeneity in
empirical work. The model implies that low-x workers are not only more likely to be currently
unemployed, but also less likely to have worked in the past. This suggests that an individual’s
work history is a useful proxy for unobserved heterogeneity. As we showed in Table 9, controlling
for the fraction of the last five years that someone was employed reduces the residual wage offer

Notes: Panel I decomposes the wage offer differential in the model into three sources shown in the Table. Panel II
reports the coefficient estimates of a dummy for employment status at the time of the offer in regressions without

or the fraction of time unemployed, in school or otherwise non-employed (labor force history). See Table 9 for
further details on the regressions in the data.

gap from 0.194 to 0.132, and to 0.127 when we additionally control for the share of time spent
unemployed or as a student. We can implement the same regression analysis on model-generated
data from a simulation and compare it to these results. Panel II of Table 12 shows that when
we do so, the model-generated wage offer gap falls from 0.195 to 0.118, which is very similar to
what we observe empirically. Controlling for work history in our simulation-based regressions
thus accounts for about half of the 15 log point contribution of differences in x and shows the
usefulness of labor force history as a control for unobserved heterogeneity.32
The Flow Value of Unemployment and Frictional Wage Dispersion. Our model also
performs demonstrably well in matching the amount of wage dispersion observed in the data.
Hornstein et al. (2011) argue that a standard model of frictional search and matching in the
labor market can only account for a tiny fraction of the wage dispersion observed in the data.
They show that extending the model to include on-the-job search can generate a higher degree
of wage dispersion but the success of the model depends on the efficiency of on-the-job search
relative to unemployed search—for which we did not have data until our survey. Consistent
with their intuition, our model generates a mean-min ratio of 1.54, within the range of empirical
values for the mean-min ratio (see Hornstein et al., 2006, who estimate a range between 1.48
and 1.83). Moreover, our model generates empirically consistent wage dispersion while yielding
32

The congruence of the regression results in the data and the model is particularly noteworthy because the
calibration of our model targets variation in prior wages rather than employment histories.

37

a reasonable value for the flow utility of unemployment (net of search costs) of 0.64, comparable
to the 0.71 value found by Hall and Milgrom (2008). Attempts to match the observed wage
dispersion typically require very low or even negative values for this parameter (see Hornstein et
al., 2011).33 Intuitively, our model does well in this respect because the higher search efficiency of
the employed implied by our findings limits the option value of unemployment. The unemployed
perceive little value in waiting for a better offer if they can continue to sample better offers and
search more efficiently while employed. Consequently, they are willing to accept lower-wage offers
despite a relatively high value of unemployment. This increases the dispersion of realized wages
from below.

4.4

Search Effort as an Amplification Mechanism

Finally, we use our model to quantify the responsiveness of search effort to changes in labor
market conditions. In particular, we consider how changes in the job separation rate and matching efficiency affect aggregate search activity and the job-to-job transition rate. We find that
fluctuations in search effort amplify the effects of these shocks.
To illustrate the amplification of business cycle shocks through search effort, we expose our
model to a large unexpected shock to search efficiency and job separation for a period of six
months and then assume the parameters return to their previous levels, which again is not anticipated by agents in the economy. More precisely, we assume that all search efficiency parameters
αi and βi decrease by 33 percent (40.6 log points) and the separation rate increases by 50 percent
(40.6 log points) during the six-month period.34
Figure 5 shows the effect of the six-month recessionary period on the search effort of the
employed and job-to-job transitions for three different specifications: (1) our baseline specification
with γ = 2.8, (2) a specification with γ = 1 (i.e., quadratic search costs), and (3) a specification
with exogenous search.35 The parameters in our alternative specifications are recalibrated to
33

We evaluate the performance of alternative models for the wage dispersion puzzle in online Appendix D3. To
underscore our point, shutting down endogenous search effort and other features implied by our empirical results
yields a mean-min ratio of 1.39 and a flow value of unemployment (net of search costs) of 0.13.
34
We abstract from compositional changes in the pool of unemployed over the business cycle and simulate the
model for the median type x.
35
In Appendix Figure D2, we show the effects of these shocks on the job-finding rate and search effort of the
unemployed, the unemployment rate, and the average wage in the economy. All four measures have an amplified
response to our shocks when we use the search cost elasticity implied by our empirical findings. Notably, movements
in the average wage reflects compositional changes in wages earned that occur as workers move across the job ladder.

match the same data moments reported in Table 10.36 The response of the job-to-job transition
rate varies considerably across specifications during the recession and the subsequent recovery.
While the job-to-job transition rate goes down in all specifications, endogenous search effort
amplifies the decline in job-to-job transitions. The strength of amplification depends on the
value of γ because the decline in search efficiency and increase in the separation rate both reduce
the returns to search. Higher values of γ imply a more elastic response of search effort to
this reduction (see online Appendix D for a formal exposition). The value of γ implied by our
empirical results (2.8) produces a decline in the job-to-job transition rate that is about 1.5 times
larger than the decline implied by quadratic search costs (γ = 1). Note also that these are
partial equilibrium responses. Recent work by Eeckhout and Lindenlaub (2019) suggests that
equilibrium vacancy-posting behavior would amplify the response of job-to-job transition rates
even further by reducing a firm’s incentive to post vacancies.
Once search efficiency and the job separation rate return to their pre-recession values, the jobto-job transition rate and employed search effort gradually overshoot their previous levels, peaking
36

The parameters and model fit for model (2) are reported in column 1 of Table D2. Model (3) sets κi =
βi = χi = 0 for both the employed and unemployed and calibrates the remaining parameters to match the same
transition rates (separation, job finding and job-to-job) as in the other two models.

eight months after the recession’s trough then gradually converging back to their steady-state
level. The overshooting and gradual convergence occur because of changes in the distribution of
workers across positions along the job ladder. As the economy recovers, more unemployed workers
find jobs, but they are predominantly at the bottom of the ladder. This shifts the distribution of
job seekers towards low-paying and consequently high-search effort jobs (Figure 5). These workers
search for and gradually find better jobs, moving up the job ladder and eventually returning the
distribution of job seekers to its steady state. The key takeaway is that a job ladder model
with highly elastic search effort—as implied by our empirical evidence—considerably amplifies
the business cycle swings in aggregate search effort and job-to-job transitions. On the positive
side, highly elastic search effort also suggests that workers reallocate to better jobs more quickly
than what is implied by quadratic search costs or models that ignore endogenous search effort
altogether.

4.5

Robustness and Further Results

In this subsection, we briefly describe a series of robustness analyses we conducted and relegate
the details to online Appendix D. First, we evaluate how different model features affect the fit
of our model. Table D1 shows that the search-wage gradient is similar for versions of the model
that do not allow for censoring or an exogenous wage offer differential. Of course, without these
features, the model does not fit the observed wage offer differential between the employed and
unemployed as well. Second, Table D2 shows how different values of γ affect the search-wage
gradient in the model. The model with γ = 1 implies an elasticity of −0.25, which is clearly above
our target range of [−0.52, −0.36], whereas a model with γ = 10 implies an elasticity of −0.45,
which is closer to the lower end of the target range. The table also shows that these conclusions are
robust to assuming a slightly lower value for the degree of frictional wage dispersion, σw = 0.20,
which is more in line with some other estimates in the literature (Tjaden and Wellschmied, 2014).
Finally, we also explore the sensitivity of our results on amplification by looking separately at
shocks to search efficiency (Figure D3) and shocks to separations (Figure D4) and find that
the amplification channel responds very similarly to both shocks. We also report results with
both shocks, but with a value of γ = 10 (Figure D5). The results are as expected, with the
higher search cost elasticity implying greater amplification. We also consider experiments with

40

permanent shocks to parameters instead of temporary shocks: a permanent decline in search
efficiency, a permanent increase in the job separation rate, and a permanent decline in offered
wages (see Table D4). Relative to the case of quadratic search costs (γ = 1), our estimates with
γ = 2.8 imply a larger response of search effort, job-to-job transitions and the unemployment rate.
In summary, our model’s implications for the fit of the search-wage gradient and the amplification
of shocks to the returns to search are robust to various alternative specifications.

Concluding Remarks

In this paper, we design and implement an expansive new survey on job search behavior and job
search outcomes for all individuals and document a wide range of new empirical facts. Though
job search is the centerpiece of search and matching models of the labor market, the literature
has lacked comprehensive evidence of the nature and extent of on-the-job search and its relation
to labor market outcomes until our study. We view our contribution as an important step in
deciphering the black box of job search, especially among the employed. Since our survey has
an established history and is ongoing, we expect it to be crucial in assessing the labor market
impacts of future downturns, including the current and unprecedented Covid-19 crisis.
Among our empirical findings, three main results stand out. First, on-the-job search is
pervasive—over 20 percent of the employed look for work each month—and it declines sharply
with one’s current wage. We estimate an elasticity of search effort with respect to wages between
-0.52 and -0.36. Second, we find that job search while employed is about four times as efficient
in generating job offers compared to job search while unemployed. Third, the employed receive
better offers than the unemployed, and a significant wage offer premium for the employed exists
even after applying a variety of controls. In summary, our results show that on-the-job search is
pervasive, elastic and dominates job search while unemployed along several margins.
We end our paper by developing a model of on-the-job search that incorporates key features
related to our empirical findings. The model provides a good fit of the data and has several
notable micro implications. Namely, the model suggests that much of the observed wage offer
premium enjoyed by the employed reflects a negative selection of those with low unobservable
skills into unemployment. Only a small fraction of the gap is left unexplained. The model also

41

highlights the importance of a high relative search efficiency among the employed by showing that
it leads the unemployed to accept relatively low wage offers despite a relatively high flow utility
of unemployment. This finding itself provides a simple resolution of the wage dispersion puzzle
introduced to the literature by Hornstein et al. (2011). The model also highlights important
macroeconomic implications. Most models of labor market search ignore the responsiveness of
job search effort to aggregate shocks because of a lack of data, or they use stylized assumptions,
such as quadratic search costs, to examine the issue. In our model, our estimate of the search
effort-wage elasticity identifies this responsiveness directly. The model suggests that aggregate
search effort is more elastic than implied by a quadratic cost function. Consequently, we obtain
greater amplification of on-the-job search effort and job-to-job transition rates in response to
shocks to search efficiency and the job separation rate. Clearly, the responsiveness of search
effort affects labor reallocation in the economy through its impact on transition rates. Therefore,
variations in worker search effort provide an important amplification mechanism. Given the
growing interest in the job ladder implications of business cycle fluctuations such as Moscarini
and Postel-Vinay (2019), Faccini and Melosi (2019) and Eeckhout and Lindenlaub (2018), and
the focus on their implication for the Beveridge curve (Elsby, Michaels, Ratner, 2015), these
findings are particularly important.

Comparison of SCE Labor Survey to External Data

A.1

Results using CPS Definition of Unemployment

Our survey allows for a broader measure of job search among the non-employed than what is
possible using the Current Population Survey (CPS). In the CPS, the unemployed are the nonemployed who either were on temporary layoff or had actively searched within the last four weeks
and were available for work. We use the same definition. The difference in scope between the two
surveys is that the CPS does not follow up with certain non-employed individuals (predominantly
the retired and disabled) who report that they either do not want work or cannot work, to ask if
they had searched.
Our survey suggests that many of these individuals actively search and are available for work.
Table A1 shows that they represent just over 12 percent of those counted as out of the labor
force under the CPS definition. A similar fraction of those out of the labor force sent at least one
application in the prior four weeks or spent some time searching in the previous seven days. As
Table 1 in the main text shows, including these individuals in our job search measure increases
the measured unemployment rate by 2.4 percentage points. Further analysis (not reported here)
suggests that the majority of the difference is due to retired individuals seeking only part-time
work. In fact, almost half of all individuals actively searching from out of the labor force are only
seeking part-time work. Conditional on actively searching, just under 9 percent are looking for
work similar to their most recent job.
Tables A2 and A3 replicate our job search analysis using the CPS scope and definition of
unemployment using the SCE data. This counts those non-employed who do not explicitly
report wanting work as out of the labor force, regardless of whether they later report that they
actively searched and are available. The tables correspond to Tables 3 and 5 in the main text,
though we only report the replicated results by labor force status at the time of the survey since
the difference in the unemployment definition only matters for this period. We determine labor
force status in the previous month using responses from a variety of other survey questions that
do not directly correspond to the CPS definition. Note also that the results for the employed
(regardless of whether they actively searched for work) are the same under both definitions.
The tables show that moving from our job search measure to the CPS measure of unemployment has only a minor effect on our estimates for the intensive margin of search effort and

search outcomes for the unemployed. The CPS definition implies a somewhat higher level of
search effort. The number of applications rises by 22 percent, to 10.35 per month, and time
spent searching rises by 25 percent, to 11.47 hours per week. The number of employer contacts,
job interviews, and job offers received all rise somewhat as well, though the differences between
the estimates in Table A3 and Table 5 in the main text are not statistically significant. The
job search definition and the CPS definition of employment also imply similar ratios of employer
contacts per application and mean job offers per application.
Finally, note that the definitions used here have no bearing on our model calibration since it
uses job search effort and outcome estimates based on labor force status in the prior month.

Search Effort Estimates in the SCE and ATUS

Next, we compare our estimates of the time spent searching for work to comparable estimates
from the time diaries of the American Time Use Survey (ATUS). We use the ATUS because

unemployment for determining labor force status.

existing measures of search effort are rare, particularly when one wants to measure on-the-job
search.
Table A4 reports our results. We focus on individuals age 18-64 in both surveys and report
the average time spent searching for work by labor force status (employed, unemployed, or out of
the labor force). We use the CPS definition of unemployment to maintain consistency across the
surveys. There are differences between the frequencies over which each survey measures search
time, for which we cannot control. The ATUS measures search time for a single day using a
detailed time diary, while the SCE asks respondents the number of hours they spent searching
for work over the previous seven days.
The differences are clear for both the extensive and intensive margins of search. Only 0.6
percent of the employed report any time spent searching on a given day in the ATUS, but 21.3
percent of the employed report searching within the last seven days in the SCE. Even among
the unemployed, who are defined as actively looking for work, the ATUS estimates suggest that
only 16.5 percent looked for work on the previous day, while the SCE estimates suggest that 97.4
percent searched within the last seven days. The ATUS also suggests that the employed only
spend less than 1 minute per day on job search, while the SCE data suggest they spend nearly
70 minutes per week on job search. Among the unemployed, the ATUS suggests they spend 27
minutes per day on job search, while the SCE data suggest they spend 11 hours per week on
4

job search. There are reasons to believe that the ATUS misses a large degree of search activity,
particularly among the employed. First, if search activity is intermittent, then a daily time diary
will fail to capture some job search. Second, the ATUS only records a respondent’s time spent on
their primary activity. Thus, if an individual is literally searching while on the job, it will likely
show up as work time rather than search time. Given these issues, we believe that our estimates
of search effort provide a more comprehensive and reliable measure than the ATUS.
This latter point has aggregate implications since it suggests that the ATUS may give biased
estimates of the relative search intensity of the employed to the unemployed. Indeed, we find that
the ATUS estimates of job search imply that the employed search only 3 percent as intensely
as the unemployed, while the SCE estimates of job search imply that they search 10 percent
as intensely as the unemployed. Define S as the total aggregate efficiency units of job search,
which is computed by weighting individuals in each labor force state E, U , and N by their search
intensity relative to the unemployed se and sn . Aggregate efficiency units of job search in this
case are
S = se E + U + sn N.
In the CPS over the 2013-17 period, there are 148.7 million employed, 8.8 million unemployed,
and 93.0 million out of the labor force, on average. If we combine these numbers with the relative
search intensities from the ATUS, it implies that on-the-job search makes up only 25 percent of
aggregate search effort, while search among the unemployed makes up 49 percent of aggregate
search effort. If we instead use the relative search intensities from the SCE data, it implies that
on-the-job search makes up 52 percent, and search by the unemployed makes up 31 percent,
of aggregate search effort. Thus, our broader and more direct measure of search intensity not
only suggests an overall greater level of on-the-job search, but also a greater degree of relative
search effort for the employed. If one wants to calculate effective labor market tightness taking
into account the number and search intensity of employed and nonparticipant workers—such as
in Eeckhout and Lindenlaub (2018) and Abraham et al. (2020), our estimates provide a direct
measurement.

Measuring Labor Force Status in the Previous Month

B.1

Prior Month’s Labor Force Status Based on the SCE Labor Supplement

This appendix details our methodology for determining labor force status in the prior month and
evaluates our measure along several comparable dimensions. We derive a labor force status for
individuals four weeks prior to their survey interview using a range of survey responses from the
SCE labor supplement. We use this measure in our model calibration because it treats the search
effort and offer arrivals reported in the survey as subsequent outcomes based on this initial labor
force status.
To determine labor force status in the prior month, we first check to see if an individual
received an offer in the four weeks prior to the survey. If so, we assign the labor force status at
the time they received their job offer (employed or non-employed). This approach assumes that
labor force status did not change between the time they received their job offer and four weeks
prior to the labor supplement survey. We believe that this is a reasonable assumption given
the relatively short time interval. In the 2014 and 2015 waves of the survey, we have additional
information on whether an individual was actively searching at the time they received their offer.
If so, we count them as unemployed, and if not, we count them as out of the labor force. For those
in the 2013 wave, we have to make some modest assumptions to determine whether someone was
unemployed or out of the labor force. If an individual who was non-employed at the time of the
job offer was employed at the time of the 2013 labor survey, we assume that they were actively
searching and count them as unemployed. If they were unemployed at the time of the survey
and have been searching for over four weeks, we also count them as unemployed. Otherwise, we
count them as out of the labor force in the previous month.
For the remaining individuals (who are the vast majority of respondents), we determine their
prior month’s labor force status starting with their labor force status at the time of the survey. If
an individual did not receive a job offer in the last four weeks but was employed at the time of the
survey, we determine their prior month’s labor force status as follows: if they report that their
current job tenure is at least one month, or if they report tenure of less than a month but with
less than two weeks between jobs, we count them as employed in the previous month. Otherwise,
we assume that these individuals were actively searching for work and count them as unemployed
in the previous month.
If an individual was unemployed at the time of the survey and did not receive an offer in the
last four weeks, we count them as employed in the previous month if they were on temporary
6

layoff for less than one month or if their current non-employment spell was one month or less.
We count them as unemployed in the prior month if they were on temporary layoff for more than
one month or if they report actively searching for work for more than one month. Otherwise, we
count them as out of the labor force.
Finally, if an individual was out of the labor force at the time of the survey and did not receive
an offer in the last four weeks, we count them as employed if their current non-employment spell
is one month or less. We count them as unemployed if they report actively searching for more
than one month and they are not currently disabled. Otherwise, we count them as out of the
labor force.
Evaluation of this approach suggests that our methodology produces a sensible measure of
the prior month’s labor force status along several dimensions. First, our estimates imply an
employment-to-population ratio of 0.779, an unemployment rate of 4.2 percent, and a labor force
participation rate of 81.8 percent. All are roughly comparable to the CPS estimates and the SCE
labor supplement estimates (using the CPS definition of unemployment) in Table 1 of the main
text.
Second, Table B1 reports labor force transition rates for two data sources. The first source
is the SCE labor supplement, which estimates the transition rates using our measure of labor
force status in the prior month and labor force status at the time of survey (using the CPS
definition described in Appendix A). The second source is the monthly CPS, which measures the
transition rates between September and October of each year (2013-17) for individuals in the
survey during both months. The transition rates for the SCE are generally very comparable to
the transition rates for the CPS. The job-separation rates into unemployment and out of the labor
force are nearly identical. The SCE labor supplement has a slightly lower job-finding rate for
the unemployed and a notably lower job-finding rate for those out of the labor force. Transitions
between unemployment and being out of the labor force are roughly comparable between the two
surveys.

B.2

Prior Month’s Labor Force Status Based on Monthly SCE Data

Another way to test the validity of our estimates of labor force status in the prior month is to
compare it to results based on labor force status for individuals in the regular, monthly SCE for
the previous month. The monthly SCE data’s measure of labor force status in the previous month
is generally not consistent with the timing of the SCE labor supplement because individuals may
respond to the labor supplement anywhere from a few days to nearly two months after their

Notes: The top panel reports the labor force transition rates using the October 2013-17 waves of the SCE Job
Search Supplement. It uses the methodology described in the appendix to determine the previous months’ labor
force status and uses the CPS definition of unemployment for labor force status at the time of the survey. The
bottom panel reports the labor force transition rates from the CPS using data matched across September and

most recent monthly SCE interview. To deal with this, we assign a prior month’s labor force
status to individuals in the labor supplement based on the timing between the supplement and
their September SCE interview. If the gap between interviews is 22 days or more, we use their
September labor force status. If the gap is 21 days or less, or if the September data are missing,
we use their August labor force status. We adjust all estimates of search outcomes so that they
can be interpreted as monthly rates.
Table B2 replicates the bottom panels of Tables 3 and 5 of the main text using the prior
month’s labor force status measure derived from the monthly SCE data. The table shows that
the estimates are very similar to those estimated using our prior month’s labor force status measure derived from the labor supplement. Some minor exceptions exist for the unemployed. For
example, application and offer rates are somewhat lower using the monthly SCE measure. Otherwise, the two measures produce nearly identical estimates of search effort and search outcomes.

Results Conditional on Observable Characteristics

In the main analysis, we explore how much wage differentials between the employed and nonemployed change when we add controls for observable worker and job characteristics to the
offer wage, the wage at the time of hiring, and the previous wage of the currently employed.
This subsection examines how much of a gap exists for other job characteristics, and how much
differences in search effort and search outcomes by labor force status persist, after controlling for
observable worker and job characteristics for these estimates as well.

Notes: Estimates come from authors’ tabulations from the October 2013-17 waves of the SCE Job Search
Supplement, for all individuals aged 18-64, excluding the self-employed, by detailed labor force status. The top
panel reports results by labor force status at the time of the survey, while the bottom panel reports the results by
labor force status in the prior month. Standard errors are in parentheses. See appendix text for set of observable
worker characteristics used as controls. Observable job characteristics include two-digit SOC occupation, two-digit
NAICS industry, and six categories of firm size. Controls also include fixed effects for survey year and state.

We begin by examining the differences in search effort and search outcomes by labor force
status after controlling for observables. Throughout the exercise, our worker controls include sex,
age, age squared, four education categories, four race categories, a dummy for homeownership, the
number of children under age six in the household, marital status, and marital status interacted
with sex. The job controls include the two-digit SOC occupation of the job, six categories of the
job’s firm size, and, when available, the two-digit NAICS industry of the firm. State and year
fixed effects are included throughout as well.

controlling for observable characteristics does little to alter the original results in the main text.
Table C1 shows that search effort is practically unchanged regardless of the measure used or
timing of the measurement of labor force status. The search effort of the employed relative to
the unemployed, ignoring search for additional work (our preferred measure of relative effort for
our model calibration) is essentially unchanged, at 0.92, compared to 0.91 unconditionally.
Tables C2 and C3 show that search outcomes and acceptance rates also change little after
controlling for observables. If we ignore the effects of censoring, we can infer the relative search
efficiency of the employed to the unemployed directly from the data as λi (s) = αi +βi s. Using the
unconditional estimates from Table 5 in the main text suggests that relative efficiency measured
this way is about 2.48. If we were to instead use the estimates from Table C2, the estimates
suggest that the relative efficiency under this method is somewhat higher, at 3.23.
Finally, Table C4 reports the characteristics of the best job offer for the employed and nonemployed after controlling for observable characteristics. Controlling for observables leads to
only modest reductions in the observed gaps in job offer characteristics between the employed
and non-employed and a somewhat larger gap in job offer acceptance rates.

Differentials between the Starting and Previous Wage

As an auxiliary analysis of the differences in prior job’s earnings observed in Table 8, our survey
allows us to examine job search retrospectively for those employed at the time of the survey
interview by asking them how they came about their current jobs. We perform this analysis
using the sample of the currently employed, excluding the currently self-employed. After removing
respondents with missing data, this sample includes 2,892 respondents. The advantage of this
approach is that we are able to examine their starting wages and previous earnings as a function
of their labor force status at their time of hiring.
Table C5 presents the characteristics of the current job and the previous job’s wage by labor
force status at the time of hire. We focus on the comparison of the non-employed to those who
move directly from employment to their current job. At the time of the survey interview, those

hired from non-employment are paid lower wages, have fewer work hours, and are much less likely
to have any benefits than those hired from another job. Controlling for observables in this case
leads to reductions in the observed gaps in job characteristics, but most gaps remain statistically
significant. The residual gap in current wages falls from 24 to 10 log points, while the residual
gap in current hours falls from 15 to 10 log points.
Estimates reported in the middle of Table C5 show that most of the current wage differences
stem from wage differences at their time of hiring. The real starting wage of those hired from
non-employment is 25 log points (28 percent) lower than the real starting wage of those hired
from employment, on average, and about 14 log points (15 percent) remains after conditioning on

observable characteristics.37 Similar to the evidence from prior wages in Table 8, the differences
in previous jobs’ wages between those hired from employment vs. non-employment are small
and statistically insignificant. This is true for both the unconditional real wage and the wage
that controls for observable characteristics. Note that the smaller difference in the premium in
starting wages compared to the premium in offered wages is likely due to selection: poor job
offers are less present in the cross-section of current jobs, as individuals accepting these jobs are
more likely to quit and to move to better-paying jobs. If the non-employed get worse offers than
the employed, this explains why the gap is smaller among starting wages compared to job offers.
Finally, Figure C3 illustrates the wage differences between those hired from employment and
those hired from non-employment for their full wage distributions. It plots the (log) differences
in the real starting wage, relative to the real previous wage, for each group, after controlling
for observable worker and job characteristics. The relative wage distribution of those hired from
employment stochastically dominates the distribution of those hired from non-employment. The
left panel of the figure shows that, after conditioning out our controls, those who transition
directly from employment receive an 9 log point increase in their wage, on average, while those
who were non-employed receive a 7 log point decrease in their wage, on average. The right panel
shows that, without any controls for observable worker and job characteristics, the average (log)
wage increase for those hired from employment rises from 9 to 10 log points and the average (log)
wage decrease for those hired from non-employment changes from 7 to 9 log points.
Figure C3: Distribution of Starting Wages Relative to Previous Wage among the Currently
Employed Conditional on Observables (left panel) and Without Controls (right panel)

Notes: Figure reports kernel density estimates of the residual of log(real starting wage/real previous wage), where
the previous wage refers to final wage of the prior job and the starting wage is for the current job. Estimates are
for the sample of the currently employed (excluding self-employed) in the October 2013-17 waves of the SCE Job
Search Supplement.
37

Our conditional estimates of the starting wage and previous wage use the same worker characteristics as our
conditional estimates of the offer wage. The starting wage uses the same firm and job controls, and additionally
controls for two-digit industry. The previous wage only includes the two-digit occupation as a job or firm control.

First Order Conditions

The first order condition for an employed individual’s search effort, se (x, w), is

[W (x, y) − W (x, w)]dFe (y),
xce (se (x, w)) ≤ βe

xcu (su (x)) ≤
[W (x, y) − U (x)]dFu (y).
1 + r R(x)

(D2)

The first order condition differs from (D1) in three ways: (i) the search cost function, (ii) the
search efficiency parameter, and (iii) the discounted expected gain from accepting a job, which
is determined by the reservation wage R(x) and the shape of the wage offer distribution for the
unemployed.

D.2

Main Results and Robustness

Table D1 shows the full set of results for the baseline model. In addition, it also shows the
results for 4 restricted versions of the baseline model: (1) a model without an exogenous wage
offer differential; (2) same as (1) but without censoring of wage offers; (3) same as (2) but
without endogenous search effort; and (4) same as (3) but without worker heterogeneity in x.
All parameters are re-calibrated to match the targeted moments except for γ, which is kept at a
value of 2.8.
Going from the baseline model to the restricted model (1), which sets the exogenous wage
offer differential to 0, shows that the model continues to match the search-wage gradient well,
and if anything would require a slightly higher level γ to fit our target range in the data. All
other targeted moments are still fitted (nearly) exactly, whereas the fit of the acceptance rate is
somewhat worse as employed workers receive worse job offers than in the baseline model.
Going from the baseline model to the restricted model (2), which sets the exogenous wage
offer differential to 0 and features no censoring, shows that the model continues to fit the searchwage gradient well, and if anything would require a slightly higher level γ to fit our target range
in the data. All other targeted moments are still fitted (nearly) exactly, whereas the fit of the
acceptance rate is substantially worse as all offers are uncensored and thus paying lower wages.
Going to the restricted model (3) without endogenous search effort shows how the model
does even worse in terms of fitting the acceptance rate of the employed. The main reason is that

without endogenous search effort even those at the very top of the job ladder continue to receive
many offers, which they are likely to reject. Interestingly, the residual wage offer differential
attributed to worker heterogeneity is substantially lower in the model without endogenous search
effort. The reason is that in the absence of worker heterogeneity (see model 4), prior wages
between unemployed and employed workers are more similar (−0.06) and thus the model needs
less negative selection among the unemployed to fit the prior wage differential of 0.01 in the data.
The comparison of column 3 and 4 also shows that the role of heterogeneity is purely to fit the
prior and offered wage differential and does not affect any of the other moments and parameters.
Table D2 shows the parameter estimates and results of the baseline model and compares them
to alternative models with different values of γ and σy . All other parameters are re-calibrated
to match the data targets, except for the exogensous wage offer differential, which is kept at
0.04 as in the baseline model. The results show that the search-wage elasticity is clearly above
the target range [−0.52, −0.36] in the model with γ = 1, with a value of −0.25. The baseline
model with γ = 2.8 matches exactly the upper bound of our target range, whereas a model
with γ = 10 is closer to the lower end of the target range with a value of −0.45. Figure D1
also shows that the model with γ = 10 fits the patterns in Figure C2 well for both applications
and hours of search. Finally, columns (4) and (5) show that the search-wage elasticity is lower in
models with less frictional wage dispersion (i.e., lower σy ). The reason is that with our calibration
strategy a lower value of σy is associated with a higher dispersion in x to match the (residual)
wage dispersion in the data. The higher dispersion in unobserved heterogeneity x attenuates the

relationship between wages and search effort and thus requires even higher values of γ to match
the search-wage gradient in the data.

Frictional Wage Dispersion

Table D3 shows the implications of our model for the wage dispersion puzzle. Hornstein, Krusell,
and Violante (2011) pointed out that search models suffer from an inherent tension between
matching transition rates and wage dispersion in the data with reasonable values for the flow

value of unemployment. As already hinted at by Hornstein, Krusell, and Violante (2011), on-thejob search, particularly when combined with endogenous search effort, attenuates this tension
because it allows a relatively high offer rate for those at the bottom of the job ladder while
implying few transitions for the average employed person (i.e., those further up on the ladder).
Table D3 shows that our model with endogenous search resolves this tension as it generates a
reasonable flow value of unemployment (net of search costs) of 0.64, which is in the range of
estimates in the literature, all while matching the key moments in our data and generating a
Mean-min ratio (conditional on x) of 1.54. The latter is in the range of estimates in the working
paper version of Hornstein, Krusell, and Violante.
The table also shows how different components of our model contribute to the resolution
of the wage dispersion puzzle: (1) a model with a lower value γ does somewhat worse as it
implies a lower flow value of unemployment, as does model (2) without the exogenous wage offer
differential. Model (3) without censoring of wage offers performs substantially worse, mainly
because it implies a lower overall offer rate while employed. Model (4) without endogenous
search effort performs worst, with a flow value of unemployment of 0.13, which is clearly below
reasonable estimates in the literature.

Responses to Changes in Returns to Search
Permanent Changes in Returns to Search

In addition to the experiment discussed in the main text, we consider here three experiments to
emphasize the aggregate implications of our findings: a permanent decline in search efficiency;
a permanent increase in the exogenous separation rate and a permanent decline in wages. All
three experiments result in a decline in return to search and affect the search behavior as the first

Notes: The table shows steady-state elasticities with respect to an aggregate search efficiency shock and an aggregate
separation rate shock. The aggregate search efficiency shock is a uniform percent decrease in the parameters αu , αe ,
βu and βe . The aggregate separation rate shock is a uniform percent increase in the separation rates δ(x) for all x.
The aggregate wage offer shock corresponds to a uniform decline in the average wage offer for both employed and
unemployed individuals.

order conditions in the Appendix D suggest. We consider the elasticity of the search effort of the
employed and unemployed as well as the job-to-job and job-finding rates with respect to changes
in search efficiency, the separation rate and the average wage offer in Table D4 and compare it
with the common assumption of quadratic search costs in the literature.
The first two columns of Table D4 show that when search efficiency declines by 10%, the
unemployment rate rises by about 15 % under the quadratic cost assumption while it rises more
than twice as much with γ = 2.8, which is our preferred estimate. A useful benchmark is the
mechanical response of the unemployment rate to a 10% decline in matching efficiency that does
not account for the endogenous response of search effort. If search behavior had not respond
the job-finding rate would decline by 10% and the unemployment rate would have increased
from 6.8% to 7.5%, which is a 10% increase and is close to what the quadratic cost specification
implies. The difference is due to the higher responsiveness of search effort of the unemployed. The
response of employed workers’ search effort is also substantially muted under quadratic search
cost assumption.
The middle two columns Table D4 shows that when the separation rate increases by 10%.
Similarly, to the experiment with a decline in search efficiency, search effort of the employed and
unemployed declines, but somewhat less since separation rates have a less direct impact on the
return to search (through the value of an employment relationship). The last two columns of Table
D4 considers an experiment when there is a one percent decline in offered wages in the economy,
which also discourages search behavior for both employed and unemployed workers. Similar to
the experiment with search efficiency, we find that job-finding and job-to-job transition rates

22

both exhibits almost three times stronger response relative to implied by quadratic search costs.
To summarize, the response of flows and the unemployment rate depends critically on this
elasticity when labor market conditions change. The quadratic cost specification—γ = 1—
underestimates the decline in search effort, the decline in transitions and the rise in the unemployment rate substantially.
D.4.2

Temporary Changes in Returns to Search

We provide here some additional results regarding the experiment conducted in Section 4.4.
First, Figure D2 shows the effects of the experiment on additional variables. It shows that the
unemployed worker’s search effort is highly elastic in the economy with γ = 2.8 and so the job
finding rate and the unemployment rate respond much more compared to the economy with γ = 1
or the economy with constant search effort. The average wage in the economy also moves much
more in the economy with γ = 2.8. Note that all changes in the average wage are due to changes
in the distribution of job seekers along the job ladder (the wage for a given position on the ladder
is assumed to be constant). At the beginning of the recession, the average wage increases because
the reservation wage increases. As a result, workers in jobs with low wages separate, leading to
an increase in the average wage. After the end of the recession, the average wage drops gradually
and substantially, as more and more workers find new jobs, many of them at the bottom of the
job ladder. Over time, these workers find better jobs and thus the average wage starts to increase
again, moving back to its steady state value.
Figures D3 and D4 show the effects on job-to-job transitions and employed job search effort
separately for shocks to matching efficiency and shocks to separations (but of the same magnitude
as the experiment in the paper). The figures show that both shocks have similar effects on the
employed job search effort.
Finally, Figure D5 shows the effects on job-to-job transitions and employed job search effort
for the same experiment as in the paper but in an economy where we set γ = 10. As discussed
earlier on, with γ = 10 we obtain a search-wage gradient of −0.45, which is closer to the lower
end of our target range. The figure shows that with γ = 10, we get even more amplification as
the employed job search effort drops even more sharply than in the economy with γ = 2.8.
