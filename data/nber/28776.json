    "abstract": "\n\nThe \u201cdebt-overhang hypothesis\u201d \u2013 that households cut back more on their spending in a crisis when they have higher levels of outstanding mortgage debt (Dynan, 2012) \u2013 seems to be taken for granted by macroprudential authorities in several countries in their policy decisions, as well as by the international organizations that evaluate and comment on countries\u2019 macroprudential policy. New results for Australian microdata are presented that reject the debt-overhang hypothesis. The results instead support the \u201cspending-normalization hypothesis\u201d of Andersen, Duus, and Jensen (2016), what can also be called the \u201cdebt-financed overspending\u201d hypothesis \u2013 that the correlation between high pre-crisis household indebtedness and subsequent spending falls during the crisis reflects high debt-financed spending pre-crisis and a return to normal spending during the crisis. As discussed in Svensson (2019, 2020), this is consistent with the above correlation reflecting debt-financed overspending through what Muellbauer (2012) calls the \u201chousing-collateral household demand\u201d channel and Mian and Sufi (2018) the \u201ccredit-driven household demand\u201d channel.\n\n",
