ABSTRACT
The cross-national intragenerational income mobility literature assumes within-country mobility is
invariant over the period measured. We argue that a great social transformation—German reunification—
abruptly and permanently altered economic mobility. Using standard measures of mobility (with panel
data for the western states of Germany and the U.S.) over the entire period 1984-2006, we find the
conventional result that income mobility is greater in Germany. But when we cut the data into moving
five-year windows and compare mobility before and after reunification, income mobility declines
significantly over the years immediately following reunification in Germany but not in the U.S.

Introduction
The empirical literature comparing the rate of intragenerational income mobility across countries
either implicitly or explicitly assumes it is invariant over the time period measured (See
Burkhauser and Couch 2009 for a review of this literature). Here we provide evidence that while
it is likely to be so in ordinary times, great social transformations can abruptly alter a country’s
rate of income mobility. This paper focuses on one such social transformation, the reunification
of Germany, and argues that it is associated with the substantial differences in the measured
levels of income mobility in Germany across time periods considered in this literature. We do so
by examining the rate of income mobility among a representative panel of residents living in the
western states of Germany before and after reunification using data that span a quarter of a
century, and contrasting it with a similar representative panel of United States residents over the
same time period. We find that income mobility among residents of the western states of
Germany during 1984-1988 fell significantly in the years following German reunification, while
the income mobility of U.S. residents during this same period either remained constant or rose
depending on the measure used.1
In our analysis, we make use of data from 1984-2006 in both the western states of
Germany and the U.S. Analyses of these data prior to reunification indicated that despite higher
cross-sectional income inequality in the U.S., it was characterized by relatively lower income
mobility than found in the western states of Germany (Burkhauser and Poupore 1997; Maasoumi
and Trede 2001). This finding was surprising since it contrasted sharply with the popular view

1

The process that ended the separation of the residents of the western and eastern states of Germany began in May
1989 with the removal of the Hungarian border barriers and the subsequent flow of eastern residents into the western
states. The Berlin Wall fell in early November 1989 and German Chancellor Kohl quickly announced a 10-point
plan calling for German reunification. In May 1990 a treaty of monetary, economic and social union was signed,
and in July 1990 the Deutsche Mark once again became the common currency for all of Germany.

1

that while the U.S. has higher levels of cross-sectional income inequality, this is offset by greater
income mobility.
In extending this research over longer time spans, it is important to consider whether the
most commonly used measures of income mobility converge to a stable rate as more years of
data are added to the analysis. The most commonly used measure of economic mobility, the
Shorrocks R (Shorrocks 1978), is simply the ratio of permanent to total inequality with higher
values signaling a less mobile society. The movement of individuals through an income
distribution associated with mobility reduces the extent of permanent inequality. So as years of
data are added to the analysis, if the “paths of mobility” are stable, the measure should converge
to a constant.
We consider this point using the Shorrocks R as well as a measure employed by Gangl
(2005) based on the Gottschalk and Moffitt (1994) method for decomposing the variance in
earnings (G-M decomposition). To do so, we use U.S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics and
German Socio-Economic Panel income years 1984-2006. Using both measures we find that the
rate of long-term income mobility does not converge to a constant over this 23-year time span.
The fact that neither of these income mobility measures asymptote to a constant value
suggests that income mobility may be period specific and hence could change appreciably over
different calendar time periods if the paths of income mobility change. To test this hypothesis,
we divide our single balanced panel into moving five-year balanced panels. Doing so allows us
to obtain a clean measure of the rate of income mobility through the five-year window just prior
to German reunification (1984-1988) for the population living in the western states of Germany,
contrast it with the income mobility of those same individuals observed in all subsequent five-

2

year windows including those that begin after reunification, and compare those outcomes with
similar measures of income mobility for residents of the U.S. over the same time periods.
Using both measures, we find, as did the original literature, that income mobility among
residents of the western states of Germany was higher than among residents of the U.S. just prior
to reunification (1984-1988). But we then show that economic mobility fell significantly among
the German but not the U.S. population in the years following reunification.
Below we provide a fuller description of the literature that most directly relates to our
analysis, the methods we use to estimate income mobility, and the data samples for each country.
We then present our empirical results and conclusions.
Literature Review
Cross-sectional measures of income inequality include both transitory and permanent
components. Researchers have long sought to quantify their relative importance. Shorrocks
(1978) provides one of the first methods for doing so. We formally define this measure in the
methods section, but note here that it conceptualizes immobility as a ratio of inequality over time
due to permanent influences to total inequality from all sources over that same period. Using
data on residents of the western states of Germany and the U.S. from 1983 to 1988, Burkhauser
and Poupore (1997) confirmed that the disposable (post-tax, post-transfer) household sizeadjusted income of Americans was more unequally distributed than was the case in the western
states of Germany over the years just prior to reunification. But surprisingly, they also found
that immobility based on their Shorrocks R measure was also higher in the U.S.
Maasoumi and Trede (2001) provide an important re-examination of Burkhauser and
Poupore (1997). They developed a distributional theory for calculating appropriate standard
errors for the Shorrocks R and formally test the significance of observed differences in their

3

estimates across residents of the western states of Germany and the U.S. Using the same data
and time period, but recasting the Shorrocks R as a measure of mobility (M = 1 – R), Maasoumi
and Trede state (p. 557): “Our main finding is that mobility estimates are statistically
significantly higher in Germany than in the United States.”
Several other studies have made use of samples of data for the western states of Germany
and the U.S. that span the event of reunification to examine individual mobility in the
distribution of household size-adjusted disposable income (Gottschalk and Spolaore 2002; Van
Kerm 2004; Jenkins and Van Kerm 2006). Van Kerm (2004) uses the Maasoumi and Trede M
measure over the years 1985 to 1997 and also finds that individuals in the U.S. were significantly
less mobile than those in the western states of Germany. Gottschalk and Spolaore (2002) and
Jenkins and Van Kerm (2006) use alternative measures of mobility but do so with samples
beginning before and ending after reunification and also find evidence of greater income
mobility in the western states of Germany than the U.S.
Other studies focus on the years since German reunification (Ayala and Sastre 2002;
Gangl 2005; Chen 2009) to examine income mobility in the entire country following
reunification. Ayala and Sastre (2002, p. 5) make use of data from 1992 to 1997 to examine
mobility of individuals in the distribution of household size-adjusted disposable income for the
U.S. and reunified Germany along with a number of other countries. One measure they consider,
which is similar to the Shorrocks R, is the trace of a transition probability matrix they construct
for movements across deciles over time. In Table 4 (p. 39), they report higher income mobility
in reunified Germany than in the U.S. despite Germany’s lower levels of cross-sectional income
inequality. These findings suggest that mobility trends for those living in reunified Germany over
the 1990s were not much different from those found in the earlier literature focusing on those

4

living in the western states of Germany prior to reunification, with both these German population
groups experiencing greater income mobility than similarly defined U.S. sample populations
over these time periods.
Gangl (2005) also examines the experiences of reunified Germany and the U.S. using
data from 1992 through 1999 along with many other countries. He also considers the movement
of individuals through the distribution of household size-adjusted disposable income. But based
on the Shorrocks R (Table 1, p. 150), he finds that Germany and the U.S. have similar levels of
mobility. He concludes that, “Comparing the evidence for the 1990s with Burkhauser and
Poupore’s (1997) data for the 1980s, it seems that income mobility has increased in the United
States but declined sharply in reunified Germany (p.151).”2 But he does not compare similar
German populations before and after reunification.
Chen (2009) also makes use of panel data from 1991 through 2003 to examine
differences in mobility in the U.S., reunited Germany, and other countries. The study also
examines the movement of individuals through the household size-adjusted distribution of
disposable income. Using the Maasoumi and Trede M measure, the study finds that mobility in
the U.S. in the period from 1993-1996 is greater than in reunified Germany. Chen notes (p. 88):
“This suggests that income mobility has increased considerably in the United States between the
1980s and 1990s, while it declined in Germany.” But once again this study does not compare
similar German populations before and after reunification.
Hence, in samples drawn prior to reunification, there is considerable evidence based on
the work of Burkhauser and Poupore (1997) and Maasoumi and Trede (2001) that residents of
the western states of Germany lived in a relatively more mobile society characterized by less

Gangl also makes use of the ratio of permanent to total variance of log incomes (G-M decomposition) as a measure
of permanent income inequality and rigidity as we do in this study. This is explained in detail in the methods
section.

cross-sectional and permanent inequality than in the U.S. In samples that span the time of
reunification (Gottschalk and Spolaore 2002; Van Kerm 2004; Jenkins and Van Kerm 2006) and
focus on residents of the western states of Germany both before and after reunification,
consistent evidence continues to emerge that the U.S. is less mobile. However, studies using
samples of residents of all the states of Germany following reunification report rates of mobility
that are the same or lower than for those residing in the U.S. over this period, although there is
some disagreement on this finding (Ayala and Sastre 2002). So, is the apparent inconsistency in
the findings of studies focusing on the mobility of those living in the western states of Germany
before unification, even when they are followed into the 1990s, and the mobility of all those
living in reunified Germany associated with reunification itself?
In our analysis, we focus on residents of the western states of Germany prior to
reunification and show that simply extending the years that this population is followed to
measure their income mobility results in findings similar to the previous literature even when the
observational period is extended to 2006. But when the assumption that measures of
intragenerational mobility are invariant over the time period measured is dropped and tested
using moving five-year windows that allow us to measure mobility before and after reunification
for this population, we find evidence that a great social transformation, in this case German
reunification, is coincident with a significant decline in their income mobility. This finding is
consistent with post-reunification studies of the entire population of reunited Germany. We then
provide some evidence that this significant drop in income mobility in our German population is
not the result of more general world economic conditions by comparing income mobility for a
similar population—residents of the U.S. in the years 1983-1988. We find no such income

6

mobility decline. In doing so, we provide an explanation that consolidates this literature.
Methods
The relationship between intragenerational economic mobility and the relative magnitudes of
permanent and transitory inequality are described in Burkhauser and Couch (2009). Over time,
standard measures of permanent income for individuals average or sum multiple observations in
order to reduce the contribution of transitory error at any point in time. Thus, a ratio of
permanent to total variation in income shows how static individual positions are in the income
distribution. Here our main measure of income mobility is the Shorrocks R. We also use the GM decomposition measure as a robustness check of our principal findings.
The Shorrocks R defines mobility as the ratio of a multi-year inequality value I (Y ) to the
weighted average of single-year inequality values I (Y t ) where the weights ( wt ) are the ratio of
mean income in year t (  t ) to the mean income over all t years (  ).

The value of the numerator, which represents permanent inequality, cannot exceed the
weighted average of the single year inequalities in the denominator. R can take values between
zero and one where zero indicates a completely mobile society and one indicates a completely
immobile society. The values between zero and one show the extent to which the income
distribution is equalized as the time interval is extended. Since longer time periods
accommodate more opportunities for relative income movements and smooth out life cycle
effects, R measures the extent to which cross-sectional inequality declines by extending the
accounting period. Hence, the R measure reflects the proportional contribution of permanent to
total income inequality over time.
7

The calculation of the Shorrocks R requires the use of inequality measures that are strictly
convex functions. The estimations presented here make use of the Theil index, I1 , which
satisfies the strict convexity property. Moreover, it is additively decomposable, mean
independent, and it satisfies the Dalton-Pigou principle of transfers. The Shorrocks R is
calculated using the following formula:
I 1 (Y ) 

Y
1 Yi
log i


n i 

Where: n is the number of individuals,  is mean income and Yi is the income of individual i.
Total income of an individual over t years is obtained by Yi   Yi t . Earlier studies demonstrate
t

the robustness of patterns in cross-national differences using alternative inequality measures
(Burkhauser and Poupore 1997; Maasoumi and Trede 2001; Chen 2009). This analysis focuses
only on calculations based on the Theil index.3
In addition to the Shorrocks R, we examine trends in intragenerational mobility using
decomposition methods developed by Gottschalk and Moffitt (1994). In our G-M decomposition,
permanent income, ‫ݕ‬௜ is the mean of log income measured over a given calendar window for
each person i. In other words, it is the average income for each individual over the time frame of
the study. Transitory log income for a person in year t is the difference between the person’s log
income in year t and their permanent income, i.e. ‫ݕ‬௜ െ ‫ݕ‬ഥ.
ప Hence, the transitory component is the
deviation of each observation from the individual averages.

where: y is the mean of log income across the whole sample and T is the mean years over the
individuals in a time window. Using these estimates of transitory and permanent variance, we
construct ratios of permanent to total variance to estimate the degree of immobility in the income
distribution based on the G-M decomposition measure of mobility. Burkhauser and Couch
(2009) discuss the conceptual correspondence between the ratio of permanent to total variance of
income based on the G-M decomposition method and the Shorrocks R which is a ratio of
permanent to total inequality. Gangl (2005) also makes use of the ratio of permanent to total
variance in log incomes as an alternative measure in his comparative study of mobility.
We use the Biewen (2002) method to construct confidence intervals for tests of
differences in mobility over time within both our German and U.S. samples. That is, we use the
method of bootstrapping to construct confidence intervals where an estimate of the sampling
distribution of a mobility index is obtained by re-sampling from the original sample. One
advantage of this method is that it takes into account the intertemporal covariance structure of
incomes without explicitly dealing with covariance calculations. Hence, this method accounts for
the longitudinal correlation in panel data for a country. To obtain more precise estimates, we
construct 95 percent confidence intervals of income mobility differences by using Biewen’s
bootstrapping scheme. Our estimates are based on 10,000 bootstrap replications.
Maasoumi and Trede (2001) use the delta method and the theory of method of moments
to build the asymptotic sampling distribution of our Shorrocks R values estimated here. We use
their procedure to calculate standard errors for our t-tests of differences across our point
estimates of these values as well as those of our G-M decomposition values, in a given time
period, for our German and U.S. samples.

Data
We use data from the Cross-National Equivalent File (CNEF), a multi-national longitudinal
micro-database distributed by Cornell University. The CNEF supports comparative research by
providing comparably defined cross-national variables from the raw data. The CNEF uses the
German Socio-economic Panel (GSOEP) and the U.S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID).
We focus on survey years 1985 to 2007 (or income years 1984 through 2006) for both countries,
using information from every second year.4 We omit alternative years of data from the analysis
because the PSID started collecting data biannually in 1997. Consistent data usage over time
makes the omission of the alternating years necessary.5 Moreover, because of the differences in
income inequality in the eastern and western states of Germany and the lack of data coverage for
the eastern states of Germany prior to reunification in the GSOEP-CNEF, the analysis is
restricted to the western states of Germany (Grabka, Schwarze, and Wagner 1999).
We focus on the disposable (post-tax, post-transfer) size-adjusted household income of
individuals.6 Disposable income is the sum of labor earnings, asset flows, private and public
transfers, the imputed rental value of owner-occupied housing and other income sources of all
individuals in a household minus taxes. The TAXSIM programs provide disposable income for
the U.S. Disposable income estimates for German households are based on the method
developed by Scharwze (1995). The unit of analysis is the person. We assume that disposable
income is shared equally within the household and we adjust for differences in household size

4

Kim and Stafford (2000) examine changes in income measures in the PSID over time. Their analysis identifies
two regimes of stability for these measures, one prior to 1980 and one afterwards, with a change in the top code on
income in the survey. Since this analysis examines income from 1984 onwards, the analysis occurs within one of
the periods of stability in measurement in the PSID.
5
To check the sensitivity of the results to the potential concern of using alternating years, where possible,
comparable estimates are calculated using contiguously available years of data. Both trends and estimates based on
contiguous and alternate years of data lie close together, indicating this potential problem is unlikely to have had an
important influence on the analysis.

The data is adjusted for inflation using CPI indices. Base income year is 1991 for both countries.

using an equivalence scale elasticity of 0.5. These equalized incomes are assigned to each
person in the household.
The analytical assumptions we make here are standard in the cross-national income
inequality literature (see Atkinson, Rainwater, and Smeeding 1995) and are similar to those in
the other studies of mobility discussed in the review of prior literature. Only survey respondents
who live in households with positive income in all relevant years are included in our sample.
Samples are appropriately weighted to represent the population and also to take into account the
effect of attrition in both surveys. Appendix A contains a more detailed discussion.
Finally to test our main hypothesis that a great social transformation—the reunification of
Germany—can explain the substantial differences in the measured level of income mobility over
the years 1984-2006 we create a single balanced panel of those living in the western states of
Germany in 1984-1988 as well as in all subsequent five-year time windows through 2002-2006.
We then compare our results with results based on a similar balanced panel of those living in the
United States over this same time period. We also explored alternative methods of arranging our
data. For example, we dropped our single balanced-panel design and compared five-year
windows that only require individuals to have positive income values over that five-year window
rather than over the entire period from 1984-2006 with virtually identical results.
Results
Table 1 shows yearly cross-sectional income inequality levels for our samples of persons living
in households with positive disposable income over the period 1984 to 2006 in the western states
of Germany and the U.S. based on a Theil I 1 (Y ) income inequality measure. Standard errors are
in parentheses.

11

Income inequality increases in both our German and U.S. samples between 1984 and
2006 but is always higher in the U.S. The final row in Table 1 shows the Shorrocks R values for
the period beginning in 1984 and ending in 2006. Over this 23-year period (using data for all
even years), the value of the Shorrocks R for income is 0.645 in the western states of Germany
and 0.673 in the U.S. Assuming that these two country samples are independent, income
mobility is significantly higher for residents of the western states of Germany than for similar
residents in the U.S. population. This finding is consistent with all previous studies focusing on
these pre-reunification populations.
The Shorrocks R values for our German and U.S. samples in Table 1 were computed over
the 23-year window from 1984-2006 using the 12 years of data described in that table. Figure 1
contains Shorrocks R values estimated sequentially for all possible time windows. The resulting
stability curves show the influence of including additional years of data on the updated estimates
of the Shorrocks R value. By definition, R is equal to 1 when the accounting period is composed
of one year. For any successive combination of years beginning with 1984 through 2006, our
German sample has a lower R value than is the case for the U.S.
*** [Insert Figure 1 Approximately Here] ***
This pattern is consistent with Germany having a more mobile structure of disposable
income than the U.S. Assuming that the samples of the two countries are independent, the R
measures are statistically significantly different for all time horizons. For example, the value of

R that spans the period of 1984-1988, the five-year period just prior to reunification, is 0.788 for
the residents of the western states of Germany and 0.869 for U.S. residents. Incorporating all
years of data, the Shorrocks R values decline to 0.645 and 0.673 respectively, the values reported
in the last row of Table 1. The immobility curves keep declining as the accounting period is

12

extended and additional years of data are added to the calculation of the Shorrocks R. However,
there is a slowdown in the pace of the decline beyond the early 1990s for both residents of the
western states of Germany and the U.S.
We repeat our construction of these immobility curves using G-M decomposition values
and also plot them in Figure 1. Because the G-M decomposition values require two data points
to calculate, our first value is for 1986. The G-M decomposition values for the western states of
Germany are consistently below the U.S. values for all time periods and decline continuously
between 1986 and 2006. Researchers using either of these methods would draw the conclusion
that while the level of immobility falls in both samples as additional years are added to the
panels beginning at the point where they were comparable (1984 income year), residents of the
U.S. are consistently found to live in a less mobile society than residents of the western states of
Germany. However they would also conclude that contrary to expectations, these measures of
immobility do not appear to asymptote to a stable value.
Researchers using different panel data sets may not always be able to temporally align the
data from different countries as we have done here. However, the underlying mathematics used
in developing the Shorrocks R and the G-M decomposition values suggest that with a sufficiently
long collection of panel data, their values should converge to a constant. If this convergence
occurred quickly in different panel data sets, as some have suggested might be the case for the
U.S. (see Gittleman and Joyce 1999), researchers might be able to conduct analyses of mobility
making use of panel data sets that start in different calendar years. The long-run immobility
measures in each individual country would converge to the same constant regardless of the
starting point of the analysis. But in Figure 1, using data that span 23 years, we find that neither
the Shorrocks R nor the G-M decomposition values appear to quickly asymptote to a constant.

13

The fact that neither of these income mobility measures quickly asymptote to a constant
value suggests that income mobility may be period-specific and hence could change appreciably
over different calendar time periods if the paths of income mobility change. We now investigate
this possibility of a change in the path of mobility by explicitly testing whether or not the rate of
intragenerational income mobility is always invariant over the time period measured by focusing
on one such potential “path of mobility” changing event, the reunification of Germany, and argue
that it may explain the substantial differences in the measured levels of income mobility in
Germany and the U.S. across time periods considered in this literature.
To test this hypothesis, we divide our single panel into moving five-year windows of the
same individuals and estimate Shorrocks R and G-M decomposition values for each panel.
Doing so allows us to observe a clean measure of the rate of income mobility through the fiveyear time window just prior to reunification (1984-1988) of the population living in the western
states of Germany, contrast it with the income mobility of those same individuals observed in all
subsequent five-year intervals including those that begin after reunification, and compare those
outcomes with similar measures of income mobility for residents of the U.S. over the same time
periods.7
Figure 2 contains the Shorrocks R values for our German population. Over the 10 fiveyear windows of data that span calendar years 1984-2006, German income immobility rises from
0.788 for the post-reunification period 1984-1988 to 0.829 for the first full post-reunification
period 1992-1996, as post-reunification years replace pre-reunification years in our five-year

7

In an appendix available on request, we provide a collection of Shorrocks R and G-M decomposition values for the
U.S. and the western states of Germany similar to those contained in Figure 1. These series are based on 11 samples
for each country that employ different initial years. In principle we could have used any of these time windows that
vary in length from two to 23 years in our analysis. We chose a five-year window here because it best allows us to
examine pre- and post-reunification periods for Germany.

windows. Thereafter, our Shorrocks R values are relatively stable. In 2002-2006, the last fiveyear window of our data, the R value of .848.
*** [Insert Figure 2 Approximately Here] ***
Figure 2 also contains the G-M decomposition values for these same five-year windows.8
Again, we observe a substantial rise in German immobility from 0.562 in our five-year prereunification period 1984-1988 to 0.689 in 1992-1996, as post-reunification years replace prereunification years in our five-year windows. Mobility values vary more over the remaining
windows than is the case with the Shorrocks R values but never return to 1984-1988 levels and
reach a value of 0.719 during 2002-2006.9
To determine the statistical significance of the marked increase in income immobility in
this population before and after German reunification, we bootstrapped confidence intervals for
pair-wise differences in Shorrocks R values for our clean pre-reunification five-year window
(1984-1988) and all other five-year windows based on the method developed by Biewen (2002).
As can be seen in column 1 of Table 2, as soon as post-reunification years replace prereunification years in 1986-1990, the increase in the Shorrocks R observed in Figure 2 is
significant at the 95 percent level—significance at this level is obtained when the confidence

Gottschalk and Moffitt (2009) provide estimates of transitory variance in the disposable household size-adjusted
income of persons. However, they do not provide estimates of permanent variance which would allow us to directly
compare their estimates to ours. We have compared the component of transitory variance used in our calculations
with their work and observe similar trends.

Bartels and Bonke (2010) capture, in five-year windows starting in 1984, the earnings volatility of prime-age men
(aged 20-59) who live in the western states of Germany, using an alternative formulation of Gottschalk and Moffitt
(1994) methods. They also look at the household size-adjusted disposable income of this subsample of the
population. They find a sustainable increase in earnings volatility over these windows but little difference in income
volatility. Since they exclude persons living in households without males aged 20-59, their finding cannot be
directly related to the traditional income mobility literature discussed here which focus on the entire population. In
addition, they create new populations in each of their five-year windows rather than follow the same population over
all years. In contrast, Biewen (2005), who does focus on the entire population of the western states of Germany
using Gottschalk and Moffitt methods, depending on his measure, finds either constant or declining household sizeadjusted disposable income mobility for residents of the western states of Germany from 1990-1998.

15

intervals do not span the value zero—and remains so over all subsequent five-year windows,
thus confirming that the immobility in Germany has increased in the post-reunification years.

*** [Insert Table 2 Approximately Here] ***

In column 2 of Table 2 we repeat this exercise for our German G-M decomposition
values . Again, these calculations are performed using Biewen’s method. As post-reunification
years replace pre-reunification years, the increases in the G-M decomposition values observed in
Figure 2 for the western states of Germany become closer to being significant at the 95-percent
level. German immobility is significantly higher in 1988-1992 than measured in 1984-1988 and
remains so over all subsequent five-year windows, reinforcing our Shorrocks R findings that
immobility among residents of the western states of Germany significantly increased at the time
of reunification.
Hence when we cut our data into five-year windows and compare mobility before and
after reunification for residents of the western states of Germany, we find income mobility is
significantly lower in Germany than in the years (1984-1988) prior to reunification using either
measure. But is this simply the result of general world conditions before 1989 and after 1990 or
can this significant change in mobility be attributed to German reunification? While this is far
from a strict difference-in-difference analysis, in Figure 2 and Table 2 (columns 3 and 4), we
compare our outcomes in our German population with residents of the U.S. over the same time
periods to look for common patterns.
Figure 2 also contains the Shorrocks R values for our U.S. population. In contrast to our
German sample, U.S. income immobility fell from 0.869 for the pre-reunification period 1984-

16

1988 to 0.823 for the first full post-reunification period 1992-1996. As in our German sample,
immobility remained relatively constant over the rest the period.
Figure 2 also contains the G-M decomposition values for these same five-year
windows.10 Again, we observe in contrast to our German sample, a substantial fall in U.S.
immobility from 0.718 in our five-year pre-reunification period 1984-1988 to 0.613 in 19921996, as post-reunification years replace pre-reunification years in our five-year windows. As
with our German sample, mobility values vary more over the remaining windows than is the case
with our Shorrocks R values. In this case however they continue to fall through 1994-1998
before rising in subsequent windows, but never return to 1984-1988 levels.
Again, we conduct tests of the differences in measures of mobility in the U.S. in the first
five-year window relative to later periods. Columns 3 and 4 of Table 2 verify that, unlike in
Germany, income mobility in the U.S. rose from 1984-1988 levels and was significantly higher
by 1990-1994 based on both the Shorrocks R measure and the G-M decomposition value.11 It
remained significantly higher in all subsequent years using the G-M decomposition measure and
in all years except 2004-2006 using the Shorrocks measure.
As a result of these different patterns of movement across the 10 five-year windows we
find, consistent with Maasoumi and Trede (2001), when we use their methodology to calculate
standard errors for each Shorrocks R value, that mobility among residents of the western states of
Germany was significantly greater in pre-reunification years 1984-1988 than in the U.S. But
10

Gottschalk and Moffitt (2009) provide estimates of transitory variance for the disposable household size-adjusted
income of persons. However, they do not provide estimates of permanent variance which would allow us to directly
compare their estimates to ours. We have compared the component of transitory variance used in our calculations
with their work and observe similar trends.
11
In order to explore the differences in mobility patterns over longer time spans, we also constructed confidence
intervals which cover an 11-year time span. We observe that the value zero is contained in all 95-percent intervals
for the United States which implies that the differences in the pairs of mobility measures are not statistically
significant. This result is consistent with the finding of Gittleman and Joyce (1999). They also do not find any
apparent trend in mobility measures with a 10-year time span. However, our results using these extended time
periods in Germany are consistent with those of five-year time periods.

17

when these same residents are compared in subsequent years, there typically is no significant
difference in the R values except in 2000-2004 where the U.S. has greater mobility. The
estimates and standard errors that support these comparisons are contained in Appendix B Table
B.1. Making similar comparisons using standard errors calculated for our individual G-M
decomposition values (Appendix B Table B.2) we also find that mobility in 1984-1998 is
significantly higher in our German sample than in our U.S. sample. But there is no significant
difference in mobility between the two samples in the post-reunification period.
Conclusions
The empirical literature comparing intragenerational income mobility across countries assumes
within-country mobility is invariant over the period measured. When we make this same
assumption and use the two most common classes of income mobility measurement (Shorrocks

R and the Gottschalk and Moffitt Decomposition) with panel data on residents of the western
states of Germany and the U.S. over the entire period 1984-2006, we find the conventional result
found by others who have tracked these populations over shorter periods since 1984. Income
mobility declines steadily in both populations as additional years of information are added to our
calculation. But income mobility is significantly greater in Germany than the U.S in all periods.
Hence our research is consistent with past research using this method of estimating income
mobility. However, even after nearly a quarter of a century (1983-2006), income mobility does
not appear to asymptote to a stable value in either country.
This suggests that either period effects are delaying this movement to a stable outcome in
both populations or are so important that rather than simply delaying movement to a stable value,
they have significantly changed the underlying path of mobility in a country. We provide
evidence that such an exogenous shock initiating a “great social transformation” occurred for

18

residents of the western states of Germany in 1989-1990, significantly altering their income
mobility—the reunification of Germany.
When we test for this possibility by cutting our data into five-year windows and
comparing mobility within our before- and after-reunification windows on the population of
residents of the western states of Germany in 1984-1988, we find income mobility is
significantly lower in our post-reunification five-year windows than in the pre-reunification
window (1984-1988) using both the Shorrocks R and G-M decomposition measures. In contrast
when we do the same with the U.S. sample, we find no significant decline in mobility. Such a
German-specific shock is consistent with the substantial differences in the measured levels of
income mobility in Germany using standard (Shorrocks R or G-M decomposition) methods on
this pre-reunification sample of residents of the western states of Germany up to present times,
and with those studies using these same methods, but on the residents of both the western and
eastern states of Germany beginning post-reunification.
It is also consistent with the differences in mobility found in the cross-national
comparative literature for Germany and the U.S. We find income mobility is significantly greater
in Germany than in the U.S. in the five-year window (1984-1988) prior to reunification. But
when we look at these same populations in subsequent windows as post-reunification years
replace pre-unification years, there is no significant difference in their mobility rates using either
of our measures of mobility. In fact, using the Shorrocks R measure, we find in one recent fiveyear period in our data (2000-2004), income mobility is significantly lower in Germany than in
the U.S. population.
It is beyond the scope of this paper to determine the specific sources of the change in
income mobility among our German population that accounts for the significant decline in

19

mobility in post-reunification Germany. However, when we use our same methods and focus on
the mobility of prime-age men (aged 25-59) in Germany and the U.S., we find that earnings
mobility in this population follows patterns similar to those for income mobility.

Appendix A
We use data from the Cross-National Equivalent Files (2010 release). Cross-sectional estimates
in Table 1 are based on our balanced panel of those living in households with positive income in
the western states of Germany and in the U.S. over the entire period of 1984 to 2006.
Total household income is equivalence-scale adjusted using the following formula:
D
EI  0.5
H
where: EI is equivalent income, D is total disposable household income, H is the household size
and 0.5 is the elasticity of scale with respect to household size.
Our measure of economic well-being is disposable (post-tax, post-transfer) household
income. In the CNEF, there are two measures of U.S. household disposable income. Their only
difference is in how household taxes are estimated. (I11102XX) uses PSID-generated household
tax payments while (I11113XX) uses the NBER TAXSIM model to estimate household taxes.
Since PSID-generated household tax payments are not available after income year 1990, we use
I1113XX. The tax burdens include federal and state income taxes as well as federal payroll
taxes.
Household disposable income is the sum of labor earnings, asset flows, private and public
transfers, the imputed rental value of owner occupied housing and other income sources of all
individuals in a household minus taxes.
Labor earnings in both countries include: wages and salary from all employment
(including self-employment income), as well as irregular payments such as: bonuses, holiday
pay, and in Germany 13th and 14th month pay.
Asset flows in both countries include: income from interest, dividends and rent.
Private transfers in both countries include: child support, alimony, and income from nonhousehold members.
Public transfers in the U.S. include: AFDC payments, supplemental security income,
unemployment compensation, worker’s compensation and the face value of food stamps.
Public transfers in Germany include: housing allowances, child benefits, subsistence
assistance and special circumstances benefits from the Social Welfare Authority, government
student assistance, maternity benefits, unemployment benefits and assistance and unemployment
subsistence allowance.
Private pensions in the U.S. include: retirement income from private pension plans,
Veterans Administration pensions, and annuities.
Private pensions in Germany include: retirement income from private pension and
annuities.
Social security pensions in the U.S. include: social security payments received by the
head, partner and other family members.
Social security pensions in Germany include: payments from old age, disability and
widowhood pension plans.
The data is adjusted for inflation using CPI indices with a base year of 1991 for both
countries.
