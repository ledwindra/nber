The Medical Care Costs of Youth Obesity: An Instrumental Variables Approach

NBER Working Paper No. 23682
August 2017
JEL No. D62,I1,I14,I18
ABSTRACT
This paper is the first to use the method of instrumental variables to estimate the causal impact of
youth obesity on U.S. medical care costs. We examine data from the Medical Expenditure Panel
Survey for 2001-2013 and instrument for child BMI using the BMI of the child’s biological
mother. IV estimates indicate that obesity raises annual medical care costs by $1,354 (in 2013
dollars) or 159%, which is considerably higher than previous estimates of the association of youth
obesity with medical costs; thus, the cost-effectiveness of anti-obesity interventions have likely
been underestimated. The costs of youth obesity are borne almost entirely by third party-payers,
which is consistent with substantial externalities of youth obesity, which in turn represents an
economic rationale for government intervention.

1 Introduction
Over the last several decades, the prevalence of youth obesity in the U.S. has increased
significantly.2 For example, the prevalence of obesity among youth aged 6-11 years rose from
11.3% in 1988-94 to 17.4% in 2011-14 (Ogden et al., 2016). It is well-established that obesity
worsens health among adults, but even among youth it raises the likelihood of Type II diabetes,
gallbladder disease, sleep apnea, joint problems, and cardiovascular risk factors (Han et al.,
2010; Guo and Chumlea, 1999; Dietz and Robinson, 2005; Ogden et al., 2002). The purpose of
this paper is to provide the first estimates of the causal effect of youth obesity on medical
expenditure in the U.S.
Previous research has estimated the correlation of youth obesity with annual medical
costs (John et al., 2012; Trasande and Elbel, 2012; Pelone et al., 2012). For example, Finkelstein
and Trogden (2008) found that, on average, obese children and adolescents incur $220 more
annual medical expenditures than healthy weight children. Monheit et al. (2009) estimated
separate models by gender and found that adolescent girls who become obese incur $790 more
per year in medical expenditures than healthy weight girls; they found no significant increase for
boys. These marginal effects represent a roughly 10-40% increase in average annual medical
expenditures for children, which were $1,914 for children aged 0-17 in 2009 (Berdahl et al.,
2013).
Other studies have focused on specific categories of expenditures. Trasande et al. (2009)
estimated that childhood obesity was associated with $237.6 million in hospitalizations in 2005,
up from $125.9 million in 2001. Trasande and Chatterjee (2009) estimate that obese children
For youth, obesity is defined based on percentile rank in gender-age specific CDC growth charts, which are based
on historical distributions of body mass index (BMI), which is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height
in meters squared. A child whose BMI is above the 95th percentile in their respective BMI distribution is classified
as obese, and one whose BMI equals or exceeds 120% of the 95th percentile is classified as severely obese; see U.S.
DHHS (2010); WHO (2000).

aged 6 to 19 years had higher utilization of inpatient and outpatient care, as well as higher
prescription drug expenditures.
A limitation of these prior studies is that they estimate the correlation between youth
obesity and medical expenditures, not the causal effect. This is because they do not explicitly
account for possible endogeneity of weight. For example, poor health may both increase medical
expenditures and cause changes in weight, which would bias estimates of the association of
weight with medical expenditures. Weight may also be correlated with unobserved socioeconomic status (SES) or access to care, both of which are correlated with medical spending
(Freedman et al., 2006). Families with lower SES are more likely to be obese and have higher
incidence of poor health or engage in risky behaviors (Fontaine and Bartlett, 2000). However,
because many of these families have poor access to care, they may have lower expenditures on
medical care, resulting in underestimation of the causal relationship between BMI and medical
expenditures. Furthermore, these studies often rely on self-reported or proxy-reported measures
of height and weight, and reporting error can bias coefficient estimates (Bound et al., 2001;
Cawley, et al., 2015a; Courtemanche et al., 2015).
This paper makes two contributions to the literature. First, provides the first estimates of
the causal effect of youth obesity on medical expenditures. Specifically, it addresses the
endogeneity of youth weight by estimating IV models using the BMI of biological parents to
instrument for their child’s BMI. Second, it uses regression calibration to adjust for nonclassical measurement error resulting from misreported height and weight, which eliminates
another potential source of bias.
Prior research has used the BMI of biological relatives as instruments to estimate the
impact of obesity on labor market outcomes (e.g. Cawley, 2004; Kline and Tobias, 2008). Other

3

studies have used these instruments to estimate the impact of adult obesity on medical care. For
example, Cawley and Meyerhoefer (2012) instrument for adult BMI using the BMI of biological
children and estimate that adult obesity raises annual medical costs by $2,741 compared to just
$656 in models that do not account for endogeneity.
Three recent studies use similar methods to estimate the causal effect of youth obesity on
medical care utilization in other countries. Kinge and Morris (2017) study data for England, use
the BMI of biological parents as instruments, and estimate that childhood obesity increases
doctor visits and medication use. Doherty et al. (2017) use data for Ireland, use the biological
mother’s BMI as an instrument for youth BMI, and find that obesity raises the number of doctor
visits and hospital inpatient stays at age 13 but not at age 9. Black et al. (2017) examine data for
Australia, instrument for child BMI using the BMI of biological parents, and estimate that child
obesity raises the medical care costs associated with doctor visits and prescription drugs (they do
not have data for hospital costs). We complement these studies by producing estimates for the
U.S. using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and by estimating the
impact of youth obesity on total medical care costs (including inpatient, outpatient, and
prescription drug costs).
We find that the impact of youth obesity on medical expenditures is greater than
previously estimated, suggesting that endogeneity of weight and measurement error cause
attenuation bias. We also find that the increase in medical expenditures caused by obesity is
paid almost entirely by third-party payers instead of out-of-pocket by the child’s family members
in the household; as a result, youth obesity imposes negative externalities through health
insurance.
2 Empirical Model

2.1 Instrumental Variables
We follow the previous literature (Cawley and Meyerhoefer, 2012; Smith et al., 2009;
Trogdon et al., 2008; Kline and Tobias, 2008; Cawley, 2004) and address the endogeneity of
weight by using the weight of a biological relative as an instrument. Specifically, we instrument
for child BMI using the BMI of the child’s biological mother.
The first requirement of an instrument is power - that it strongly predicts the endogenous
regressor. Parent BMI is a powerful instrument because roughly half of the variation in weight
across individuals is genetic (Comuzzie and Allison, 1998; Grilo and Pogue-Geile, 1991) and
each parent contributes roughly half of their child’s genes. We test the strength of correlation
between parent and child BMI, and find that first-stage F-statistics in our main specifications
range from 449 to 1,025, which far exceed the conventional standard of F = 10 (Stock et al.,
2002).
The second requirement for an instrument is validity - that the instrument affects the
outcome only through its correlation with the endogenous covariate, and as a result, is excludable
from the second-stage regression. One concern about validity is common household
environment; that is, one might be concerned that the instrument (mother’s BMI) is affected by a
common household environment (related to diet and physical activity) that also affects youth
weight. As always, it is impossible to directly test the exclusion restriction, but there is
substantial evidence from the behavioral genetics literature that any effect of the common
household environment on adult weight is so small as to be undetectable (Nan, 2012;
Silventoinen et al., 2010; Haberstick et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2009; Wardle et al., 2008; Grilo

5

and Pogue-Geile, 1991).3 That is not to say that environment does not matter for obesity – it
clearly does – but what matters is the individual environment (Wardle et al., 2008).
Another potential threat to validity is pleiotropy: the genes that affect BMI may also
affect some other characteristic that directly affects medical care costs. The genetics literature
has studied whether the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with high
BMI are also associated with other characteristics; they find that they are robustly associated
with the components of BMI (weight and height), and obesity-related illnesses such as diabetes,
high blood pressure, and high cholesterol (which are part of the total effect of obesity), but not
characteristics unrelated to obesity that could affect medical care costs (Locke et al., 2015;
Speliotes et al., 2010). Thus, findings from the genetics literature tend to be consistent with the
identifying assumption although we fully acknowledge that such evidence regarding instrument
validity is always suggestive rather than definitive.
2.2 Misreporting of Height and Weight
The data we use in this study, the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) asks a
single adult in the household to serve as the primary respondent. That person is responsible for
reporting not only their own weight and height, but also proxy-reports the weight and height of
everyone else in the household, including the children. If proxy-reports are not accurate, then
reported child BMI and obesity may not reflect the child’s true BMI and weight status. Prior
research has documented that adults tend to under-report their own weight and slightly overreport their height, resulting in understated BMI (Cawley et al., 2015a; Shiely et al., 2013;
Gorber et al., 2007; Villanueva, 2001). Studies of parental reporting of adolescent BMI show

3

Given research on the effect of obesity on earnings and wages for women (e.g. Cawley, 2004), one might be
concerned that maternal weight could affect child weight through the medium of income. However, there is limited
evidence of income affecting child weight in developed countries (see the review in Cawley, 2015) and we have reestimated our IV models controlling for household income and found the results to be robust.

6

slight under-reporting of weight and over-reporting of height that results in under-reports of BMI
(Cullinan and Cawley, 2016; Brettschneider et al., 2012; O’Connor and Gugenheim, 2011;
Goodman et al., 2000; Reed and Price, 1998). In their meta-analysis of parental proxy-reporting
studies, Lundahl et al. (2014) find that over 50% of parents underestimate the weight of their
overweight and obese children.
Measurement error in child BMI is a potential source of bias not addressed in previous
studies of the association of youth obesity with medical expenditures in the U.S. Under certain
conditions, IV estimation can correct for bias due to measurement error in the endogenous
regressor (Bound et al., 2001). However, IV models are not robust to all forms of measurement
error. Correlation between the child’s BMI and the proxy reporting error in child BMI (due to
under-reporting) combined with positive correlation between parent and child BMI may result in
correlation between the IV (parent BMI) and measurement error in child BMI, and a potential
upward bias in IV coefficient estimates (O’Neill and Sweetman, 2013).
To assess the potential bias due to under-reporting, we estimated IV models two ways:
one in which parent and child BMI were not adjusted for reporting error, and a second in which
they were adjusted for such error, using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) as validation data.4 There is negligible difference in the coefficient estimates across
all specifications between uncorrected IV models and those where both child and parent BMI are
error corrected, which suggests that measurement error does not significantly bias the IV
estimates in this specific context.

4

Error correction is performed by regressing true height and weight on reported height and weight and other
observables in the NHANES. The estimated equation is then used to predict true height and weight in the MEPS.
We error-correct reported height and weight using the regression calibration method of Courtemanche et al., (2015).
See Appendix section A.1 for details of the calibration methods used.

7

Measurement error may also diminish the explanatory power of the instrument. There are
clear advantages to selecting instruments which have superior first-stage performance, as weak
instruments can not only lower the precision of IV estimation, but may have considerable finitesample bias (Bound, Jaeger, and Baker, 1995). Even among instruments that are not weak,
instruments with higher first-stage F-statistics are preferable as stronger instruments are less
sensitive to violations in the exclusion restriction caused by moderate error in the instrument
(Small and Rosenbaum, 2008). We find that correcting our instruments for reporting error
improves their first-stage performance, so we use that approach throughout our analysis.
2.3 Model Specification
Medical spending in general, and on children in particular, is highly positively skewed
with a non-trivial number of individuals with zero expenditures, and a small number of
individuals with very high expenditures, in any survey year (Monheit et al., 2009; Finkelstein
and Trogden, 2008). To account for the shape of the expenditure distribution we use a two-part
model of medical expenditures (Jones, 2000). The first part is a Logit model that estimates the
probability of having positive medical expenditures (the extensive margin). The second part
estimates the amount of medical expenditures conditional on having positive spending (the
intensive margin), and is specified as a generalized linear model (GLM) with Gamma variance
structure and log link.5 We conduct the specification tests suggested by Manning and Mullahy
(2001) to confirm the choice of link function and expenditure distribution.6 We also perform a
modified Hosmer-Lemeshow test by regressing prediction error from each model on deciles of
the distribution of predicted expenditures. We fail to reject the null hypothesis that the decile

5

As both the Logit and Gamma models are specified as GLMs, we incorporate instrumental variables into both parts
of the two-part model using the IV-GLM estimator of Hardin and Carroll (2003).
6 Park tests confirm our choice of conditional variance; in particular that the variance is proportional to the square of
the conditional mean. We find λ = 2.03 − 2.06 across our samples.

8

coefficients are jointly equal to zero, indicating the choice of distribution and link function are
appropriate.
Weight status for a child is determined by percentile rank in gender-age specific CDC
growth charts, which are based on historical BMI distributions prior to the obesity epidemic. A
child whose BMI is above the 95th percentile in their respective BMI distribution is classified as
obese, and one at or above 120% of the 95th percentile is classified as severely obese; U.S.
DHHS (2010); WHO (2000). When classifying child weight status, we use child BMI corrected
for reporting error in order to avoid misclassification. In all model specifications, we include
child age in months and gender (when boys and girls are pooled) to account for the different age
and sex specific distributions of BMI.
We measure the impact of obesity as the average marginal effect (AME) of weight gain
that moves a child from healthy weight to obese. To estimate the AME, we follow the method of
Cawley et al. (2015b). Using estimates from the two-part model of medical expenditures, we
predict the level of expenditures associated with the mean BMI among healthy weight children
and the mean BMI among obese children. The difference between these two predictions is the
AME of moving from healthy weight to obese. To estimate the AME of severe obesity, we
analogously subtract the expenditures associated with the mean BMI among healthy weight
children from the expenditures associated with the mean BMI among severely obese children.
As an extension, we estimate the direct medical costs attributable to youth obesity as the average
treatment effect (ATE) of a binary indicator for obesity.
All models are just-identified, using the mother’s BMI as the instrument. We use
mother’s BMI as the instrument because mothers appear in the same household of the child more
often than fathers. As a robustness check, we also estimated IV models that also used higher

9

orders of mother’s BMI (squared and cubed) as instruments and found that the IV estimates of
the effects of obesity were relatively unchanged. However, including higher orders of the
instrument lowered the first stage F-statistics, so we report results for the just-identified model
with higher first-stage power.
Both parts of the two-part model of instrumental variables include the following
regressors. Child characteristics include gender, race/ethnicity (White, Black, Hispanic, other
race), and child age in months. We also control for whether the child self-reported her height and
weight, although less than one percent of children self-reported their BMI when their mother was
the primary respondent. The parent characteristics include education level for mothers and
fathers if they are present in the household (high school graduate, some college, bachelor’s
degree or higher, with no high school diploma as the base category). We do not control for
parent race because it is highly co-linear with child race. The household characteristics include
census region (midwest, south, or west with northeast as the base category), whether the
respondent lives in an MSA, household composition (number of household members age 0–5
years, 6–17 years, 18-64 years and over 65), and year fixed effects. We also include two
indicator variables for insurance coverage; the first indicates whether the child is covered by
public insurance such as Medicaid or CHIP, and the second indicates whether the child is
covered through private health insurance. Health insurance variables are potentially endogenous
in the model, but we include them because they are important determinants of medical spending.
As a robustness check, we re-estimated the models excluding the insurance variables and found
similar results.
Costs of youth obesity are likely not entirely borne by the child’s family, and costs paid
by third party-payers, may represent negative externalities of youth obesity. We extend our

10

analysis by estimating the impact of youth obesity on payments made by third-parties as well as
out-of-pocket expenditures. Estimates of the impact of youth obesity on third-party payments
may obscure important differences in the cost of obesity driven by different insurance coverage.
Of particular concern, medical care rendered to children on public health insurance may not be
reimbursed at the level private insurance would pay for the same service. As an extension, we
estimate models separately by type of insurance coverage: private health insurance or public
health insurance (Medicaid or SCHIP) in which we estimate the impact of youth obesity on
expenditures paid by insurance.
3 Data
The Household Component of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) is a
comprehensive, nationally representative survey of the U.S. civilian non-institutionalized
population. In the MEPS, families are surveyed five times during a two-year period about the
medical care utilization and expenditures of all members of their household. In addition,
information from the household is supplemented by expenditure data collected directly from
participants’ medical service providers and pharmacies through a Medical Provider Component.
For each household, a single individual is the primary respondent; usually the mother. Heights
and weights are not measured in the MEPS, and the primary respondent typically reports the
heights and weights of everyone in the household. This means that the primary respondent selfreports her weight and height, and proxy-reports the weight and height for everyone else in the
household.
We use data from the 2001-2013 MEPS. We limit the sample to children aged 11-17
years in households with their biological mother7, where the mother is under 64 years with non-

7

The restricted-use MEPS biological linkage variables identify step-children or extra-familial children who live in
the household and are not related to the respondent. However, we cannot distinguish adopted children from

11

missing BMI. We do not include children younger than 11 years because of high rates of nonresponse for height and weight. We eliminate two children whose mothers had BMI in excess of
80 out of a concern about extreme reporting error. We omit 210 children who were pregnant.
We exclude 1,890 children who were underweight, because our focus is on estimating the
medical care costs of obesity, and if medical care costs are higher for the underweight because of
illness, that could make it more difficult to accurately predict changes in expenditures at high
levels of BMI.8 We also exclude 54 children with annual medical expenditures in excess of
$50,000, because such costs are likely due to an extreme health shock rather than obesity. The
resulting sample has 36,064 children aged 11-17 years who lived in the same household as their
biological mothers.
For each reported medical event, we observe total medical expenditures (from inpatient
care, outpatient visits, and prescription drugs), as well as expenditures by payer type (e.g.
Medicaid/CHIP, private insurance, out-of-pocket). We omit dental expenditures because it is the
only category of medical expenditures that is not verified with providers, and thus is less
accurately measured. We inflate all expenditures to 2013 dollars using the All Goods, Urban
Consumer Price Index (BLS, 2016).
MEPS data are collected through a stratified multi-stage probability design, which we
account for in the calculation of the standard errors for our marginal effects. In particular, we use
128 balanced repeated replications (BRR) and Fay’s method to estimate standard errors in our
non-IV and IV two-part GLM models. This method accounts for clustering at the PSU-level,
stratification, and person weighting.

biological children. However, adopted children likely represent only about two percent of children (Child Trends,
2012).

4.1 Summary Statistics
Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1 for boys and Table 2 for girls. Among
boys, 75% had positive medical expenditures, which averaged $1,441. Among girls, 78% had
positive medical expenditures, which averaged $1,411. Mean error-corrected BMI was 22.6 for
both boys and girls. The prevalence of obesity (defined as having a weight-for-height that is at
or above the 95th percentile of the historic distribution, with weight and height corrected for
maternal proxy reporting error) was 18% for boys and 15% for girls.9 The prevalence of severe
obesity was 4% for boys and 3% for girls.
4.2 Impact of Youth Obesity on Total Medical Expenditures
Table 3 contains the estimated marginal effects on annual medical expenditures
associated with an additional unit of BMI, as well as the marginal effects of moving from healthy
weight to obese and moving from healthy weight to severely obese. The first columns are from a
two-part non-IV model that does not correct for the endogeneity of child weight, and the second
set of columns are from a two-part IV model that does. The first stage F-statistics for the IV
models range between and 449 and 1,025.
The IV models indicate that, for boys and girls pooled, an additional unit of BMI raises
annual medical care costs by $103, obesity raises annual medical care costs by $1,354, and
extreme obesity raises annual medical care costs by $2,628. These are substantially higher than
the associations estimated by the non-IV model; for example, whereas the IV model indicates
that obesity raises medical care costs by $1,354 per year, the non-IV model indicates that obesity
is associated with $310 higher annual medical care costs. This difference is likely due to omitted
variables bias – the various ways in which obese individuals differ from those who are not obese.

9

These are similar to estimates from NHANES of the prevalence of obesity among children aged 2-19 years in the
U.S. in 2011-14: 16.9% for boys and 17.1% for girls (Ogden et al., 2016).

13

Subsequent rows of Table 3 present results separately for boys and girls. In general, the
estimated impacts of excess weight on medical expenditures are greater for girls than boys.
Obesity raises annual medical care costs by $1,095 for boys and $1,687 for girls, and severe
obesity raises annual medical care costs by $2,149 for boys and $3,256 for girls. However, these
differences across sex are not statistically significant.
The marginal effects reported in Table 3 predict the impact of changes in weight near the
mean, which can be misleading if the relationship between youth weight and medical
expenditures is highly nonlinear. In Figure 1, we use the results of our IV two-part model to
illustrate the relationship between predicted medical expenditures and changes in weight status
as indicated by the percentile of BMI z-scores from CDC age and sex specific distributions for
boys and girls. We use the BMI z-score instead of raw BMI because we are pooling across age,
and youth BMI tends to rise with age.
Figure 1 graphs the relationship between BMI z-score and medical expenditures for boys
and girls pooled. Medical expenditures are indicated by the solid line, and the dashed lines depict
the 95% confidence intervals. A dotted line shows the distribution of BMI z-scores in our
sample.10 The most important conclusion from Figure 1 is that medical care costs are very
nonlinear in BMI z-score; for the vast majority of the range of BMI medical care costs rise only
slightly; however, they rise exponentially for youth with BMI z-scores over the 90th percentile.
Figure 2 graphs the relationship between BMI z-score and medical expenditures
separately for boys and girls; for the sake of clarity we omit the lines for the 95% confidence
intervals and the distribution of BMI z-score, but a version with those is available upon request.
The graph indicates that the relationship between medical care costs and BMI z-score is similar

10

Note that the z-scores are based on the historic distribution of BMI. Because of the rise in weight over time, more
of the sample is at higher z-scores than would be the case if the z-scores were based on the MEPS sample.

14

for boys and girls. However, boys have slightly higher medical expenditures over the range of
lower BMI z-scores. Girls’ medical expenditures rise at a higher rate over the range of healthy
weight BMI z-scores (z<85th percentile), overtaking boys’ medical expenditures just above the
50th percentile and rising at an increasingly higher rate beyond the 50th percentile. Above the
obesity threshold of BMI z-score at the 95th percentile, expenditures rise exponentially with BMI
for both boys and girls.
All of the estimates presented so far are of the increase in expenditures associated with
BMI and obesity. Next, we estimate the total medical care costs associated with different weight
classifications (healthy weight, obese, severely obese). Table 4 contains predicted per capita total
annual medical expenditures for healthy weight, obese, and severely obese children, as well as
directly estimated ratios of predictions across weight classes. For boys and girls pooled,
predicted annual expenditures are $875 among the healthy weight, $2,230 among the obese, and
$3,504 among the severely obese. Thus, obesity raises medical care costs by 159% and severe
obesity raises them by 310%. These are higher for girls than boys; obesity raises medical care
costs by 128% among boys and 200% among girls, and extreme obesity raises medical care costs
by 252% among boys and 389% among girls.
4.3 Externalities of Youth Obesity
We extend the above analysis to estimate the impact of youth obesity on expenditures
paid by third parties, as well as out-of-pocket. In Table 5, the first set of columns show the
impact of weight on expenditures by all third-party payers, and the second set of columns show
the impact of weight on the household’s out-of-pocket expenditures. In every case, the impact of
weight on out-of-pocket expenditures is small and not statistically significant, even for severe
obesity. In contrast, the impact of weight on expenditures by third-party payers is large, and not

15

statistically different from the impact on overall expenditures that was shown in Table 3. In
other words, virtually all of the increases in medical expenditures due to youth BMI are external
costs, borne by third-party payers rather than the household of the child.
As an extension, we examine the impact of weight on medical expenditures paid by
insurance by type of health insurance coverage. Table 6 provides IV results for expenditures paid
by insurance among covered by private insurance or public insurance (Medicaid or CHIP). For
boys and girls pooled, there are no significant differences across payer type in the impact of
weight on medical expenditures, although the impact of weight on insurance payments is slightly
larger for children with private coverage. However, when we separate our samples by gender,
significant differences in the impact of weight across sources of coverage become apparent.
Specifically, obesity is associated with $630 higher medical expenditures per year for boys with
public health insurance, versus $1,306 higher medical expenditures for boys with private
insurance. For girls, the difference is in the opposite direction, though less pronounced, with the
impact of obesity being $1,547 for girls with public health insurance versus $1,165 for girls with
private coverage. In other words, obesity raises insurance paid medical care costs more for boys
with private coverage than boys with public coverage, but the opposite is true for girls. Because
of that difference across boys and girls, when boys and girls are pooled the effect of obesity on
insurance paid medical costs is not significantly different for those with public and private
insurance.
We re-estimate the medical care costs of youth in specific weight classifications, this time
focusing just on expenditures by third-party payers and estimated separately by type of insurance
coverage; the results are presented in Table 7. Among youth with private health insurance,
obesity (relative to healthy weight) raises medical expenditures by the insurance company by

153%, and severe obesity raises them by 305%. Among youth with public health insurance,
obesity raises medical expenditures by public health insurance by similar percentages: 176% for
obesity and 310% for severe obesity.
Controlling for type of insurance coverage, there are two notable differences by gender.
First, among those with private health insurance, severe obesity is associated with a greater
increase in third-party payments among boys (425%) than girls (292%). This is because the
medical expenditures of the severely obese are greater among boys than girls, while the
expenditures of the healthy weight are similar for boys and girls. The second notable gender
difference is that, among those with public health insurance, obesity raises public health
insurance expenditures by 319% for girls compared to 103% for boys, and severe obesity raises
them 625% for girls compared to 171% for boys. This is due to two factors: obesity and severe
obesity are associated with higher costs for girls than boys, and healthy weight is associated with
lower costs for girls than boys.
4.4 Aggregate Expenditures Due to Youth Obesity
The two-part IV model of medical expenditures can also be used to estimate the
aggregate medical costs of youth obesity in the U.S. To do this, we re-estimated our models
using a binary indicator of obesity (based on weight and height corrected for reporting error) in
place of continuous BMI, and calculated the total direct costs attributable to youth obesity that
corresponds to the population of children like our IV sample: aged 11-17 and living in the same
households as their biological mothers who are not underweight or pregnant (which is 76% of all
children). Table 8 shows that from 2001 to 2013, the annual direct cost of youth obesity averaged
$9.33 billion of which $9.31 billion (99.7%) was borne by third party payers. In the most recent
year (2013), the total direct cost of youth obesity was $13.37 billion.

Given the nature of the instrument used in the IV model, the sample consists of children
in the same household as their biological mothers who are not underweight or pregnant. As a
result, our estimates of the direct costs attributable to youth obesity are not those for the full
population of children aged 11-17. Under the strong assumption that the estimated effects of
obesity in our subpopulation generalize to the full population of children aged 11-17 years, we
estimate that the total direct cost of youth obesity from 2001 to 2013 averaged $12.4 billion per
year.11 For the most recent year (2013), it totaled $17.6 billion, up from $10.7 in 2001.
5 Discussion
This paper provides the first estimates of the effect of youth obesity on medical care costs
for the U.S. that are corrected for both for endogeneity and reporting error in weight. We
estimate a two-part model of instrumental variables that exploits the heritable component of
weight by using the BMI of the biological mother as an instrument for the BMI of the child, and
also correct for reporting error in child and adult weight by using external validation data in
conjunction with instrumental variables.
We estimate that youth obesity (relative to healthy weight) raises annual medical
expenditures by $1,349 for boys and girls pooled; when estimated separately by gender the cost
of youth obesity is greater for girls ($1,686) than boys ($1,085). Assuming that the results for our
sample generalize to the population of youth, the results of the IV model imply that obesity
among 11-17 year olds raised annual medical care costs by $17.5 billion in 2013.

11

Using the MEPS sampling weights, we calculated that the population of children aged 11-17 from 2001 to 2013
was an average of 29.4 million per year, while the subpopulation of children in the same household as their
biological mothers was an average of 22.2 million per year. To generalize our direct cost estimate, we multiply our
subpopulation estimate by 29.4/22.2 to inflate it to the full population.

18

We also estimate that severe obesity (relative to healthy weight) raises annual medical
expenditures by $2,618 for boys and girls pooled; when estimated separately by gender the
increase is greater for girls ($3,255) than boys ($2,127).
Virtually all (99.3%) of the increase in medical expenditures associated with youth
obesity is paid by third-party payers. This implies that youth obesity imposes substantial
externalities through the health insurance system. Such externalities represent an economic
rationale for government intervention to prevent and reduce childhood obesity (e.g. Cawley,
2015). However, to some extent this externality may simply represent a transfer; i.e. it may not
result in deadweight loss to society if youth do not exhibit the moral hazard of gaining weight, or
parents do not underinvest in healthy weight for their children, because the costs of youth obesity
are borne by third-party payers (Bhattacharya and Sood, 2011; Cawley, 2015).
We find that the impact of weight on medical care costs is highly nonlinear. For most of
the range of BMI z-score, medical costs rise only modestly. However, above the 90th percentile,
medical costs rise exponentially.
In all cases, the estimates of the IV model are considerably higher than those from the
non-IV model, which suggests considerable omitted variable bias in the non-IV models. Our
finding that the causal effect of youth obesity on medical care costs is greater than previously
appreciated has important implications for policy. Many estimates of the cost-effectiveness of
interventions to prevent or reduce youth obesity are based on estimates of the association of
youth obesity with medical care costs, which underestimate the causal effect (e.g. Gortmaker et
al., 2015; Trasande, 2010; Whitlock et al., 2010; Brown et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2003). For
example, Gortmaker et al. (2015) evaluate the cost effectiveness of seven interventions to reduce
childhood obesity. Their analysis utilizes the estimate in Finkelstein and Trogden (2008) that

19

youth obesity is associated with $282 (2014 dollars) higher expenditures, which is far below our
estimate of the causal effect of youth obesity on medical expenditures of $1,354 (2013 dollars).
As a result, studies may be underestimating the cost-effectiveness of interventions that
successfully prevent and reduce youth obesity.
As with all IV models, one must be cautious about instrument validity. We assume that
the instrument – mother’s BMI – is correlated with the endogenous regressor (youth weight)
because of the genetic variation in weight and not because of a common household environment
effect on the mother’s weight. This assumption is supported by extensive research in genetics
that finds a strong genetic component to the weights of youth and adults, and a negligible
common household environmental effect on adult weight (e.g. Wardle, 2008; Silventoinen et al.,
2010). It is also supported by the genetics literature that finds that the SNPs associated with high
BMI are generally not associated with characteristics unrelated to high BMI (e.g. Speliotes et al.,
2010; Locke et al., 2015). We have also conducted a falsification test in which we used stepparents as an instrument for child weight, and found that it was not a powerful instrument. This
is consistent with previous studies (e.g. Cawley and Meyerhoefer, 2012; Au et al., 2017) that
conducted falsification tests using unrelated individuals as instruments and found insignificant
correlations in weight in the first stage. While one must always be wary because it is impossible
to prove the null hypothesis of validity, the available evidence is consistent with validity of the
instrument.
There are limitations to our approach. As with any model of instrumental variables,
identification relies on an exclusion restriction that is ultimately untestable. Also, the MEPS data
only allow us to compare the medical expenditures of youth at different levels of BMI; it does
not allow us to observe how medical expenditures change with changes in BMI. Another

20

limitation is that BMI is an imperfect measure of fatness (Burkhauser and Cawley, 2008;
O’Neill, 2015). Ideally we would have more accurate measures of fatness such as percent body
fat, but BMI is the only measure of obesity available in the MEPS. A further limitation is that
we are only able to examine short-run effects of youth obesity; although the MEPS contains data
on medical expenditures over a two-year period, we are unable to examine how youth obesity
affects adult medical expenditures, or how one’s long-term weight history affects current-year
medical expenditures. Doherty et al. (2017), however, find that a longer duration of childhood
obesity is associated with a larger increase in health care utilization. Weight and height are selfreported or proxy-reported in the MEPS; necessitating that we adjust for reporting error using the
NHANES as validation data. We are unable to examine the impact of youth obesity on specific
categories of medical expenditures (e.g. inpatient care or prescription drugs) because of the
limited sample size. Finally, our identification strategy requires us to estimate models of youth
who are living with their biological mothers; as a result, caution should be used when
generalizing to the entire youth population. However, an advantage of this study relative to ones
that used similar approaches to study adult obesity is that the sample selection necessary for the
IV model is less restrictive for children than adults; i.e. a higher percentage of youth live with
their biological mother than the percentage of adults who live with a biological child. Thus, these
results for childhood obesity may more easily generalize to the population of children than the
results for adult obesity to the population of adults.
Despite these limitations, our analysis contributes to the literature on the costs of obesity
by providing the first estimates of the impact of youth obesity on US medical expenditures that
are corrected for both endogeneity and measurement error. These estimates are considerably
higher than associations of youth obesity with medical expenditures, and as a result, effective

21

policies and interventions to prevent and reduce youth obesity may be more cost-effective than
previously appreciated.

A Appendix
A.1 Corrected Body Mass Index
Error-corrected BMI is computed using the regression calibrated height and weight measures.12
We follow the regression calibration method of Courtemanche et al. (2015). A summary of their
imputation procedure follows here.
Let 𝑏 ∗ denote the true measures of height and weight, and 𝑏𝑗 denote the reported values in
sample 𝑗 ∈ {𝑀, 𝑁}. In our analysis, the MEPS (𝑗 = 𝑀) is the principle sample and the NHANES (𝑗 =
𝑁) is the validation sample. RC requires there is a surrogate, or matching agent, present in both the
principal and validation samples, as well as the transportability of the surrogate across both datasets. The
first condition is that for true values 𝑏 ∗ , there exists a surrogate (typically the reported values) 𝑏𝑗 such
that the distribution of the outcome 𝑦 given (𝑏 ∗ , 𝑏𝑗 ) is the same as 𝑦 given 𝑏 ∗. Essentially the observed
heights and weights cannot contain information about the outcome that is not already reflected in true
values. Another interpretation is that measurement error cannot be correlated with unobserved variables
that influence the outcome. The second condition is transportability of the surrogate; that the underlying
distributions of true BMI in both datasets are equal conditional on the surrogate. Transportability implies
that,
E(𝑏 ∗ |𝑏𝑀 , 𝑍𝑀 ) = E(𝑏 ∗|𝑏𝑁 , 𝑍𝑁 ), 13
where matrix 𝑍𝑀 contains exogenous covariates shared in both datasets (gender, age, race, etc...).
Like Courtemanche et al. (2015), we use the NHANES as a source of validation data. However,
we are unable to use proxy-reported height and weight as matching agents for children because the
NHANES only includes measured heights and weights for children under the age of 16; Children over the
age of 16 may self-report their height and weight. To impute both child and adult height and weight, we
follow the method in Courtemanche et al. (2015), and use the percentile rank of height and weight as the
matching agent. In this way, misreporting manifests not only as a stochastic process on additive error, but
a shift in the height and weight distributions. Using the percentile rank as the matching agent only
requires that the expected values of true height and weight conditional on reported measures are
monotonically increasing in the reported measures (Courtemanche et al., 2015). For example,
Monotonicity implies that individuals who self-report higher weight are expected to have higher true
12

MEPS public-use files do not contain height and weight for years after 2000, and are obtained from restricted use
files.
13 This is known as weak transportability (Lee and Sepanski, 1995).

35

weight than those who self-report lower weight. Courtemanche et al. (2015) test this monotonicity
assumption in the NHANES, and do not find evidence to reject it.
For both adults and children, we predict height and weight in the NHANES as a function of
gender, race, and their interactions with linear b-splines generated from the percentile rank of height and
weight and higher orders of age (age in months for children). We then use the estimated equations to
predict true BMI for adults and children in the MEPS.14

A.2 Predicted Medical Expenditures
An alternative approach to characterize the non-linear relationship is to use the method of Cawley
and Meyerhoefer (2012) and Cawley et al. (2015b) and predict medical expenditures associated with
different levels of BMI by re-estimating our IV 2PM including child BMI and child BMI squared (we
instrument using both mothers’ BMI and BMI squared). We illustrate the relationship between predicted
medical expenditures over the range of BMI for all children (Fig 2) boys (Fig 3) and girls (Fig 4) using
the more flexible model of expenditures. Predicted medical expenditures are denoted by the solid line and
the distribution of children in the sample is indicated by the dotted line.
For boys and girls pooled, expenditures have a J-shape over BMI, suggesting that medical
expenditures rise more sharply for increases in body weight among higher BMI children. The minimum
of annual expenditures is near a BMI of 22.5, which is around the threshold for overweight for most
children in the sample. Expenditures rise more quickly over BMI > 32.5, which is severely obese for
almost all children in the sample. In Figure 3, the expenditures are much flatter. In Figure 4, the J-shape is
more pronounced, with higher predicted expenditures over the severely obese range.

14

We use the STATA code provided in Courtemanche et al. (2015) to carry out the regression calibration using
percentile rank as the surrogate.
