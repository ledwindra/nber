Information Technology and the Distribution of Inventive Activity
Chris Forman, Avi Goldfarb, and Shane Greenstein
NBER Working Paper No. 20036
April 2014
JEL No. O31,O33,R11
ABSTRACT
We examine the relationship between the diffusion of advanced internet technology and the geographic
concentration of invention, as measured by patents. First, we show that patenting became more concentrated
from the early 1990s to the early 2000s and, similarly, that counties that were leaders in patenting
in the early 1990s produced relatively more patents by the early 2000s. Second, we compare the extent
of invention in counties that were leaders in internet adoption to those that were not. We see little difference
in the growth rate of patenting between leaders and laggards in internet adoption, on average. However,
we find that the rate of patent growth was faster among counties who were not leaders in patenting
in the early 1990s but were leaders in internet adoption by 2000, suggesting that the internet helped
stem the trend towards more geographic concentration. We show that these results are largely driven
by patents filed by distant collaborators rather than non-collaborative patents or patents by non-distant
collaborators, suggesting low cost long-distance digital communication as a potential mechanism.

1. Introduction
Vannevar Bush’s publication Science: The Endless Frontier frames a range of questions about the
localization of information, and about how the costs of knowledge transmission, dissemination, and
collaboration increase in distance (Jaffe, Trajtenberg, and Henderson 1993; Glaeser, Kerr, and Ponzetto
2010; Delgado, Porter, and Stern 2008; Saxenian 1994, etc.). Over the years this conceptualization has
motivated a range of research questions about the collocation of inventive activity. The creation and
maintenance of geographic clusters of invention, and their links to regional economic growth, have been
an important part of innovation policy.
In the years since the publication of that book, several factors have potentially altered the
importance of agglomeration for inventive activity. First, globalization and the vertical disintegration of
supply chains—inwhich increasingly many different companies manufacture the components that make
up a final product—has increased the premium on invention as a source of regional competititiveness,
thereby reinforcing pre-existing differences in the geographic distribution of invention. Second, declines
in communications costs—engendered by the widespread diffusion of the internet—have substantially
reduced the cost of certain kinds of communication, leading to changes in the geographic distribution of
innovation and invention (Agrawal and Goldfarb 2008; Forman and van Zeebroeck 2012). These two
changes push in opposite directions.
In this chapter, we ask whether invention, as measured in patent data, has become more
geographically concentrated between the early 1990s and the early 2000s. We address this topic in
order to explore the overall net effect of the two forces pushing for or against geographic agglomeration
of invention. We also explore the potential role of internet technology in explaining this pattern. Either
an increase or decrease in the geographic concentration of invention is possible. By increase in
concentration, we mean that the places that served as the location for the majority of the inventions in
the past serve as a source for an even greater share in the future. The places rich with inventions
2

become richer. By decrease, we mean the opposite, that the places that are not rich with invention
become richer.
This chapter builds on our research agenda examining how the diffusion of the internet altered
the geographic concentration of activity (Forman, Goldfarb and Greenstein 2002, 2005, 2008, 2012). The
approach of this study resembles our approach in Forman, Goldfarb, and Greenstein (2012), which
examined how geographic variation in business internet adoption shaped US wage growth over the late
1990s. This chapter examines a different outcome, and, hence, a different question, namely, whether
those counties that were leading innovators (as measured by patents) between 1990 and 1995
increased or decreased their relative rate of patenting between 2000 and 2005. Then we explore how
internet adoption correlates with this change, and whether it increases or decreases the rate of
concentration in patenting.
We undertake this exercise with the view that economic theory does not give clear guidance to
the expected result. There are good reasons to expect the internet to have increased the geographic
concentration of invention or to have decreased it.
On the side of increasing concentration: The literature on the economics of IT often finds a
localization of the adoption of IT (Forman, Goldfarb, Greenstein (2008) and Forman and Goldfarb (2006)
reviews the literature). The effective use of advanced internet technology draws on frontier IT skills that
are found disproportionately in urban areas, and it builds on existing links between business use of IT,
support services, and specialized labor markets in urban areas. Furthermore, while the internet reduces
communication costs for both local and distant communication, most communication and most social
contacts are local (Wellman 2001, Hampton and Wellman 2002). Much of the literature on internet
adoption and usage, including much of our own prior work, shows a high geographic concentration of
economic activity in the areas where the internet is most frequently adopted (Blum and Goldfarb 2006;
Sinai and Waldfogel 2004; Forman, Goldfarb, and Greenstein 2005; Kolko 2002; Glaeser and Ponzetto
3

2007; Arora and Forman 2007; Forman, Goldfarb, and Greenstein 2012; Agrawal, Catalini, and Goldfarb
2011; etc.).
On the side of decreasing concentration: the internet is a communications technology, and it
can allow people in isolated areas to plug in to the rest of the economy. Communications scholars and
others have long argued that the internet might overcome geographic barriers to economic (and
political) activities. Cairncross (1997) and Friedman (2005) provide popular summaries of these ideas,
emphasizing the “death of distance” and the “flat world”. Moreover, in the specific context of
knowledge production and invention, the internet can reduce collaboration costs and, potentially, the
importance of collocation in inventive activity. The empirical literature also has some findings suggesting
that the internet might increase cross-institutional and cross-regional collaboration over time (Jones,
Wuchty, and Uzzi 2008; Agrawal and Goldfarb 2008; Ding, Levin, Stephan, and Winkler 2012). The
setting most closely resembling the one we study in this chapter (Forman and van Zeebroeck, 2012) also
shows that internet adoption leads to increased distant collaboration for patents issued to researchers
in a given multi-establishment firm.
Our findings generally favor the view that the internet worked against the concentration of
invention. Studying the growth rate of patenting across counties, we show this in several steps. First, we
show that invention became more geographically concentrated over this period, suggesting a general
trend towards increasing concentration of invention. Specifically, our raw data suggest that patenting
grew 27% during this period. For the top quartile of patenting counties from 1990-95, patenting grew
50%. For those below the median, patenting did not grow at all. We highlight differences between our
setting and findings and a line of research which has found convergence in economic growth rates
across countries and geographic regions (e.g., Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1991; Magrini 2004; Delgado,
Porter, and Stern 2010, 2012). While differences between our results and this research line may reflect
differences in our measure of local economic activity (patents v. economic output or wage growth), we
4

also show that our findings are driven in particular by substantial increases in the concentration of
patenting at the very top of the distribution.
We next demonstrate how county-level growth in patenting is shaped by business internet
adoption and the prior concentration of patents. While the geographic concentration of patenting
increased over the time period we study, the internet appears to have mitigated, rather than
exacerbated, that trend. In particular, the overall concentration of invention rose but, among counties
that were leading internet adopters, we see little change in the concentration of invention.
Furthermore, our results suggest that this relationship is strongest for long-distance collaboration.
Although it is important to recognize that we cannot rule out the possibility that an omitted factor
caused both internet adoption and growth in patenting in the set of internet-adopting counties with
that were behind in patenting in the early 1990s, our results are more consistent with the internet
reducing the geographic concentration of invention than with the internet increasing that
concentration.
To summarize, our chapter provides evidence about the net effects of opposing factors that
have influenced the concentration of inventive activity since the publication of Bush’s book. We
highlight the effects of the Internet. Recent literature has shown that scientific collaboration across
institutions has increased over time and that IT is partly responsible. We contribute the first direct
evidence that the diffusion of the internet is correlated with a reduction in the geographic concentration
of inventive activity, suggesting that the diffusion of the internet has the potential to weaken the
longstanding importance of the geographic localization of innovative activity. Our results also raise
intriguing questions about whether the internet’s impact on the geographic concentration of invention
is distinct from its impact on the geographic concentration of other economic activity, such as wages,
business adoption of IT, hospital productivity, and so on. That is, the internet may be a force for

5

weakening the links between the geography of inventive activity and the geography of other economic
activity.

2. Data
We use a variety of data sources to examine how adoption of advanced internet among firms
will affect local inventive activity. We match data on IT investment from the Harte Hanks Market
Intelligence Computer Intelligence Database with patent data from the USPTO between 1990 and 2005.
We further combine this with data from the US decennial Census. Our sample construction is shaped by
key features of our data and the setting. First, we expect a significant lag between the time when IT
investments are made and when they influence the creation of new invention. Second, there is
significant year-to-year variability in patent output at the county level and particularly at the industrycounty level. Third, as with our prior work, we exploit the historical circumstances that led to the
deployment of the internet. Instead of creating a gradual deployment and adoption, circumstances
created a rather abrupt change in a short time span, leading to a period “before the internet diffused”
and a period “after the internet diffused.” As a result, in our core analyses our base period and
reference period both include six years—that is, we look at the difference in patent output between
1990 and 1995 (before the diffusion of the internet) and 2000 and 2005 (after its diffusion). 1
2.1 Patent Data
Our data on local inventive output are measured using patent data from the USPTO. We use
application rather than grant date to measure the timing of inventive activity because the applicationto-grant delay varies over time, and because the application date is closer to the time when the
invention occurred. 2

1

We have experimented with alternative specifications for the base and reference years. Our results are robust to these
changes, though we do sometimes lose significance for some results in some years.
2
See, for example, Griliches (1990).

6

To measure the effect that internet adoption will have on local inventive activity, we match
patents to counties using inventor locations. 3 For patents with multiple inventors that reside in multiple
counties, we allocate patents to all of the counties where inventors reside. We use county as the unit of
observation rather than MSA to facilitate comparison with prior work that has studied the implications
of internet investment on local economic outcomes (Forman, Goldfarb, and Greenstein 2012). Our
procedure will accurately assign patent output to the correct county to the extent that inventors work
where they reside, but may make some errors in assignment when inventors commute between
counties. 4
In our analyses we use a combination of raw patent counts and five year citation-weighted
patents as our measure of inventive output. As is well known, not all inventions meet the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office (USPTO) criteria for patentability (Jaffe and Trajtenberg 2002). Further, inventors
must make an explicit decision to patent an invention, rather than relying on some other method to
appropriate the value of their invention. There will be incremental inventive activity that is not patented
and therefore is not reflected in patent statistics (e.g., Cohen, Nelson, and Walsh 2000). However, so
long as the propensity of firms in a location to patent does not vary significantly over time in a way that
is correlated with internet adoption, this should not bias our estimates of the key parameters of
interest. It is also well known that patent values are very skewed. Weighting by citations is one way to
address this problem; citation-weighted patents have been shown to be correlated with a firm’s stock
market value above and beyond the information provided by patent counts (Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg
2005).
Our baseline analyses explore whether internet adoption is associated with changes in the
growth of total patents and citation-weighted patents over time. However, we also explore how our
3

Specifically, we match the city and state of the inventor location to ZIP codes, and then match the ZIP codes to counties.
We also believe that using inventor locations, which is often the location of their residence, is superior to the alternative of
using the location of the assignee, which is the location of a firm or corporate building in the vast majority of patents. The latter
does not necessarily correspond with the location of the invention, particularly in corporations that assign all patents to
headquarters, irrespective of their origins.
4

7

results vary by county-industry group. To do this, we utilize the 2011 USPTO concordance between
patent classes and NAICS manufacturing industries. 5 In these analyses, our unit of analysis is countyindustry-year rather than county-year. To facilitate comparisons between our county and countyindustry analyses, all of our patents have a primary class that can be mapped to NAICS using the 2011
concordance. Thus, our measures of patent growth will miss some inventive activity that cannot be used
downstream in manufacturing.
We perform several additional analyses over different subsets of the patent data. First, we reestimate our models over the set of patents with more than one inventor. We label these as
collaborative patents. Second, we define distant collaborative patents as ones in which there exists a
pair of inventors for whom the distance between the centroids of the inventors’ home counties are
greater than 50 miles apart.
We further explore differences based upon the type of institution to which the patent is
assigned. We identify educational institutions based upon a search of key phrases in the assignee name
field of the patent. 6 We further use the assignee role field in the patents to identify whether the patent
is from a U.S. private company or corporation or a U.S. government agency. 7 Last, we examine how our
results vary by technological field, using the Hall, Jaffe, Trajtenberg (2001) technology categories.
A primary question in this paper is whether internet investments by firms contribute to changes
in the distribution of inventive activity. In particular, our interest is in exploring whether internet

5

For more details on the correspondence, see http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/data/
naics_conc/2011/read_me.txt. To perform the correspondence, we use the primary USPTO class in the patent document. In
cases where a given USPTO class is related to several industries, we weight the patent equally across the industries to which it is
related.
6
Specifically, we define educational institutions as those which have any of the following phrases in the assignee name (not
case sensitive): “university”; “institute of technology”; “college”; “school of medicine”; “school of mines”; “school of
engineering”; and some permutations on these phrases. Further, we identified several specific research active institutions for
which these key words were not accurate predictors of educational status. As a result, we also added the following phrases:
“georgia tech”; “cornell research foundation”; “wisconsin alumni”; “board of regents for education”; “oregon graduate center”;
“iowa state research foundation”; and “board of governors for higher education, state of rhode island”
7
We also explored whether our results differed for private firms who were small (below 500 employees) and large using the
small entity status field on USPTO data on maintenance fee payments. We found that many of our main results were
qualitatively similar for small and larger entities, though the economic magnitudes were somewhat weaker among small firms.

8

investments have contributed to more or less concentration in outcomes. To facilitate this, we construct
measures of the total number of patents in the county between 1990 and 1995 to measure
concentration in innovative activity prior to the diffusion of the internet.
2.2 Information Technology Data
As mentioned above, our IT data come from the Harte Hanks Market Intelligence Computer
Intelligence Database (hereafter CI database). 8 9 The database contains rich establishment- and firmlevel data including the number of employees, the number of personal computers and servers, and
adoption of internet applications. Harte Hanks collects these data to resell to the marketing divisions of
technology companies. Interview teams survey establishments throughout the calendar year; our
sample contains the most current information as of December 2000.
Harte Hanks tracks over 300,000 establishments in the U.S. We exclude government, military,
and nonprofit establishments because the availability of advanced internet for these establishments and
the relationship between advanced internet adoption and patent output may be different than for
private firms. Our sample contains nonfarm business establishments with over 100 employees, and
includes a total of 86,879 establishments. Prior work has demonstrated that these data are among the
best establishment-level data about the use of IT in the US, and include half of all establishments with
100 or more employees in the US (Forman, Goldfarb, and Greenstein 2005). While our sample includes
only relatively large establishments, this is not a significant problem because very few small
establishments adopted advanced internet technology during this time.
The construction of our measure of advanced internet is identical to that used in our previous
study of the effects of advanced internet adoption on local wage growth (Forman, Goldfarb, and
Greenstein 2012). It includes those facets of internet technology that became available after 1995 in a
8

These data have been used in a variety of previous studies (including our own) studying the adoption of IT (Bresnahan and
Greenstein 1997; Forman, Goldfarb, and Greenstein 2005), the productivity of IT investments (Bresnahan, Brynjolfsson, and Hitt
2002; Brynjolfsson and Hitt 2003; Bloom, Sadun, and Van Reenen 2012), and the effects of IT investments on local wage growth
(Forman, Goldfarb, and Greenstein 2012).

variety of different uses and applications. The raw data in the CI database include at least 20 different
specific applications, from basic internet access to software for internet-enabled enterprise resource
planning (ERP) business applications.
Our measure of advanced internet adoption involves investment in frontier technologies, often
with significant adaptation costs. As we have done in our prior work, we use substantial investments in
e-commerce or e-business to identify advanced internet investment. Specifically, we looked for evidence
of investment in two or more of the following internet-based applications: ERP, customer service,
education, extranet, publications, purchasing, and technical support. Not all of these applications are
directly involved in the production of new inventions, however all support intra- or inter-establishment
communication and coordination, and often involve significant changes to business processes. Our
measure of advanced internet investment should be viewed as a proxy for a firm’s propensity to invest
in frontier IT that facilitates communication and collaboration, rather than a direct measure of IT
investments that are used as part of the production process in science. As a result, it is possible this will
generate some attenuation bias in our estimates. 10
We aggregate our establishment-level indicators of advanced internet investment to the county
to obtain location-level measures of the extent of advanced internet investment. Because the
distribution of establishments over industries may be different in our sample of firms from that of the
population, as we have done in prior work we weight the number of establishments in our database
using the number of establishments by two-digit NAICS industry in the Census Bureau’s 1999 County
Business Patterns data.
This measure has several attractive properties. 11 For one, industry-level measures of this
variable correlate with Bureau of Economic Analysis measures of industry-level differences in IT

10

Unfortunately, the CI database collects little information on applications that directly facilitate knowledge sharing or
knowledge management. See Forman and van Zeebroeck (2012) for further details.
11
Here we summarize some highlights. For further details, see Forman, Goldfarb, and Greenstein (2012).

10

investments. The measure also highlights significant regional differences in advanced internet use
(Forman, Goldfarb, and Greenstein 2005). Advanced internet adoption is high in locations that include
internet-intensive and IT-intensive industries, such as the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Denver, and
Houston. In such regions, advanced internet adoption is high even for establishments that are not
producing in traditionally IT-intensive industries.
As noted above, variance in our IT measure will come from differences in adoption rates among
large nonfarm business establishments at the county level. Because we do not directly measure the IT
investment behavior of public and educational institutions, our analyses of the effects of IT investment
on patenting behavior in these institutions must be treated with some caution.
2.3 Controls
We combine these IT and patent data with additional county-level information from a variety of
sources. First, we use information from the 1990 US Census on population, median income, and
percentage of population with a university education, high school education, below the poverty line,
African American, and above 64 years old. We further use the 2000 US Census to control for changes in
factors such as population and change in percent African American, university education, high school
education, and over 64 years old. We obtain county-level information on additional factors that will
influence the propensity of a county to innovate such as enrollment in Carnegie tier 1 research
universities in 1990; the fraction of students enrolled in engineering programs; and the 1990 percentage
of the county’s workforce in professional occupations. 12 To control for differences in growth rates based
on the scale of economic activity, we also include controls for employment, establishments, and weekly
wages in the country from 1999 County Business Patterns Data.
Table 1 provides the descriptive statistics. While our Census data include the population and
demographic data of over 3100 counties, as in our prior work we drop several hundred counties for

12

Downes and Greenstein (2007) showed that these three help explain the availability of internet service providers.

11

which we have no IT data. Generally, these are very low population counties with few firms and patents.
There are 2734 counties for which we have IT data. There are also some counties that we drop from our
analysis because there are no patents in either the 1990-95 or 2000-05 period, though results are robust
to assuming that these are zero growth counties. If there are no patents in both periods, we set growth
in patenting to zero. Across our different dependent variables we have between 2519 and 2854
observations. As a result, we have between 2235 and 2833 observations in our combined IT- and patent
data set.
The top part of table 1 shows the average percent change in our dependent variable across
different categories. The average percent change is decreasing for some variables. Because these
variables are the average of the percent changes across counties, this does not mean that total
patenting in the US for that category is decreasing. Some counties in our data have a large percent
change but, due to their small size, do not have a large impact on the total amount of patenting.
3. Empirical strategy and results
Our empirical analysis proceeds in four steps. First, we establish the relationship between
patent levels in the 1990-95 period and growth in patenting between 1990-95 and 2000-05. We show an
increased concentration in patenting. Second, we show that there is no significant relationship between
advanced internet adoption by firms and growth in patenting. Third, we show that the relationship
between prior patent levels and growth in patenting is weaker for counties with high levels of internet
adoption. Fourth, we demonstrate that the effect of internet on weakening the trend to increased
geographic concentration of patenting is driven by changes in distant collaborative patents and private
firms.

3.1 Increased concentration of patenting

12

Figure 1 shows a Lorenz curve for patenting by county comparing 1990-95 to 2000-05. The size
of the area under the 45 degree line measures the degree of inequality across counties in their
patenting behavior. As the curve moves away from the 45 degree line, it suggests that the geographic
concentration of patenting rises in general. Thus, the curve suggests that patenting was somewhat more
geographically concentrated in the 2000-05 period than in the 1990-95 period.
Table 2 shows that the increase in concentration is influenced by a substantial increase in
concentration at the very top of the distribution, with the top 0.1% of counties (i.e. the top three
counties) showing a particularly large increase in the share of patents. That finding suggests that we
should make inferences with some caution, as this finding depends on the performance in a very small
number of locations. We can have more confidence in the inference since, as noted above, other
evidence points in a similar direction. Overall patenting grew 27% during this time period. This suggests
that patenting increased in the top 30th percentile of the distribution of patenting. It stayed roughly the
same between the 30th-70th percentiles, and fell for the remainder of counties.
In Table 3, we show the related result that those counties that had a large number of patents in
the 1990-95 period had a relatively large increase in their level of patenting. In particular, column 1
contains the following regression:
(1)

Log(Patentsi0005)- Log(Patentsi9095) =α+γXi+β1Patentsi9095+εi,

Where Patentsi9095 and Patentsi0005 are the number of cumulative patents in county i from 199095 and 2000-2005, Xi is a vector of controls including county-level business and demographic data (as
listed in Table 1), and εi is a normal i.i.d. error. The positive and significant coefficient in the first row
shows that those counties with higher levels of patenting from 1990-95 had higher rates of patent
growth.

13

The remaining columns of the table show robustness to various alternative specifications.
Column 2 weights the patents by citations over five years. Columns 3 and 4 use only collaborative
patents to define the dependent variable. 13
Columns 5 through 8 show robustness to switching the unit of observation to the industrycounty. This enables the analysis to account for differences across industries in where agglomeration
takes place. The industry-level data is challenging to work with as there are many zeros. Therefore, the
simple logged difference growth equation cannot be used as it will lead to many missing observations. In
addition, the data are highly skewed, with a long positive tail and a fatter-than-normal negative tail in
the difference. Instead of the logged difference, we use an ordered probit, splitting the dependent
variable into nine groups: (∞,-5), [-5,-2), [-2,-1), [-1,0), 0, (0,1], (1,2], (2,5], (5, ∞). The results show that
this alternative specification does not yield qualitatively different results: Those counties that were
leading in patenting from 1990-95 had relatively rapid growth in patenting.
The controls also yield some interesting, though perhaps unsurprising, correlations. The level of
education, and changes in the level of education, are strongly and positively correlated with growth in
patenting. In addition, the fraction of the local students in engineering is highly correlated with growth
in patenting. An increased population is associated with increased growth in patenting while an
increased elderly population is associated with decreased growth in patenting.
To summarize, these results suggest that regions where patenting had previously been
concentrated experienced the greatest increase in patent growth between the early 1990s and early
2000s. That is interesting because these findings differ qualitatively from findings on the literature on
regional growth and convergence (e.g., Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1991; Magrini 2004; Delgado, Porter,
and Stern 2010, 2012), which have documented evidence of convergence in aggregate growth rates
across countries and regions in a range of settings. There may be several reasons for this difference in
13

We maintain total patents 1990-95 as the key covariate as we believe the key measure is the rate of overall patenting in the
pre-period. That said, results are robust to using collaborative patents as the key covariate.

14

findings. Our focus is on growth in patenting rather than growth in economic output or wages. Further
and related, our results are particularly influenced by increases in the concentration of inventive activity
at the very top of the patenting distribution, a result that may have no analog for other measures of
economic activity, such as wage growth. In addition, recent work has found that the presence of clusters
of related industries may have a significant impact on growth in employment and patenting (Delgado,
Porter, and Stern 2010, 2012). These clusters may have been particularly influential in influencing the
top tail of the distribution of inventive activity over our sample. We stress these different effects,
because it highlights the open question motivating our study. There are different mechanisms at work,
and they push in different directions, and it is important to know whether they operate to the same
degree and direction on all economic activity.
3.2 Business adoption of the internet and growth in patenting
Before assessing whether the internet might enhance or reduce the rate of concentration in
patenting, it is important to establish the baseline relationship between internet adoption and growth in
patenting. Table 4 shows that there is no significant correlation between internet adoption and growth
in patenting overall and a weakly significant correlation for collaborative patents. Column (1) shows the
results of the following regression:
(2) Log(Patentsi i0005)- Log(Patentsi9095) =α+γXi+β2AdvancedInterneti+εi,
Where AdvancedInterneti measures the extent of advanced internet investment by businesses in
county i in 2000. Columns (2) through (8) mirror the columns in Table 3, and while the coefficients are
positive, there is no significance in any of the non-collaborative patent specifications. In this table, and
in all remaining tables, we do not report the coefficients on the controls because they are not the focus
on the analysis and the signs and significance are similar to those found in Table 3.

3.3 Business adoption of the internet and the concentration of patenting
Table 5 examines whether internet adoption increases or reduces the rate of concentration in
patenting. Column (1) shows the results of the following regression:
(3) Log(Patentsi0005)- Log(Patentsi9095) =α+γXi+β1Patentsi9095+β2AdvancedInterneti
+β3Patentsi9095 AdvancedInterneti +εi,
The core coefficient of interest is β3, the interaction between pre-period patenting and internet
adoption. The result suggests that internet adoption is correlated with a reduction in the growth in
concentration of patenting (as measured by the correlation between growth in patenting and patenting
in the pre-period). The quantitative importance is not apparent from the coefficient, so we separately
calculate the implied marginal effect. It suggests that an increase in advanced internet by one standard
deviation reduces the increase in concentration by 57%, which is quite substantial. In other words,
among counties that were leaders in internet adoption, the rate of patent growth between the early
1990s and the early 2000s is only weakly correlated with the level of patenting in the 1990 to 1995
period.
Put another way, for a county in the 25th percentile of internet adoption, moving from the 25th
percentile in patenting to the 90th percentile in patenting in the early 1990s yields an implied increase in
the growth of patenting of 5.4 percent. For a county in the 75th percentile of internet adoption, the
same move yields an implied increase in patenting of 2.3 percent. For a county in the 90th percentile of
internet adoption, the same move yields an implied increase in patenting of just 0.4 percent. 14 Thus,
internet adoption is correlated with a reduction in this divergence: High internet adopting locations that
were not leaders in patenting did not fall behind.

14

The increase estimated from the regression is substantially smaller than might be suggested by the descriptive statistics
presented in the introduction because the regressions include controls for county-level demographics that are highly correlated
with growth in patenting, such as education and population growth.

16

As in Tables 2 and 3, the alternative specifications in Columns 2 through 8 are broadly consistent
with column 1. The qualitative results are similar if patents are weighted by five year citation rates, if
only collaborative patents are used, and if the unit of observation is the county-industry.
One potential concern with this analysis is that AdvancedInterneti and Patentsi9095 are highly
correlated and therefore the interaction term captures an unusual part of the distribution. Figure 2
addresses this concern. It presents a scatter plot of AdvancedInterneti on the horizontal axis and
Patentsi9095 on the vertical axis. Figure 2 shows that, while AdvancedInterneti and Patentsi9095 are indeed
highly correlated, there is plenty of variation. There are many locations with high levels of
AdvancedInterneti and low levels of Patentsi9095 and there are many with low levels of AdvancedInterneti
and high levels of Patentsi9095.
Broadly, Table 5 is suggestive that internet overcomes isolation in invention, though we need to
be cautious as it also could be an omitted variable driving both increased invention and increased
internet. Next we provide some suggestive evidence that the internet facilitated communication by
inventors, providing some support for a causal interpretation of Table 5.

3.4 Collaboration, firm type, and local growth in patenting
Table 6 reproduces the first four columns of Table 5, but with alternative dependent variables.
Instead of measuring patents and collaborative patents, Column 1 looks at the growth in the number of
distant collaborators, as defined in section 2.1. Column 2 looks at the growth in the number of
collaborative patents by county in which none of the collaborators are distant from each other. Column
3 looks at non-collaborative patents. Columns 4 through 6 show the same analysis but with citationweighted patents.
In our previous results we documented that advanced internet adoption was associated with
decreasing concentration in innovative activity. One possible explanation for this result is that advanced
17

internet adoption made innovative activity in less innovative places relatively more attractive through a
decline in the costs of collaboration. Another possibility is that the internet increased the productivity of
innovative activity in less innovative regions relative to more innovative ones by, for example, more
easily accessing labor, consultants, or ideas developed elsewhere. While we are unable to identify
between these hypotheses, we view the results of Table 6 as suggestive that advanced internet
adoption reduced the extent of geographic concentration for inventions developed through distant
collaborations more than other types of inventions.
In particular, the internet is primarily a communications technology that reduces the cost of
both distant and local communication, but the impact of patenting by firms is largest for distant
collaborations (Forman and van Zeebroeck 2012). As in Table 5, Columns 1 and 4 (row 3) of Table 6 show
that, for counties with low rates of advanced internet adoption, leading counties in the pre-period
increased distant collaborations much faster than other counties. For counties with high rates of
advanced internet adoption, leading counties in the pre-period did not increase distant collaborations
much faster.
In contrast, for non-distant collaborations (columns 2 and 5 row 3) and for non-collaborative
patents (columns 3 and 6 row 3) we see no difference between counties with high and low rates of
advanced internet adoption, leading counties in the pre-period, and the increase in patenting. Thus, the
correlation in Table 5 between patenting in the pre-period, advanced internet, and patent growth does
not hold for non-collaborative patents and short-distance collaborative patents even though it holds for
long-distance collaborative patents.
Because the role of the internet is likely to facilitate distant collaboration, and because prior
work suggested that the internet increased distant patenting between firms (Forman and van Zeebroeck
2012), this suggests that the results of Table 5 may suggest a causal relationship rather than only a

18

spurious relationship measuring counties that were becoming more innovative overall (and therefore
becoming more innovative in terms of both patenting and internet adoption).
Table 7 separates patents assigned to US-based private firms, patents assigned to educational
institutions, and patents assigned to governments. Consistent with the suggested mechanism, and
consistent with the fact that our data on advanced internet represents US-based private firms and not
educational institutions or government, our results are strongest for US-based private firms.
We have conducted a number of additional robustness checks on our main results. While not
shown here to save space, qualitative results are robust to several alternative specifications including
slightly different years, dropping controls, assigning a value of 1 to counties with zero patents in a given
period to avoid dropping missing values, and to using alternative threshold choices for the ordered
probit in the results at the industry-county level.
3.5 Differences in concentration of patenting across technology categories
Table 8 shows the results by technology category. We use the 6 broad technology categories
defined by Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg (2001). We find that the results are broadly robust across
categories with the exception of Computers and Communication, which does not display increase
concentration in patenting activity over time. While this finding merits additional investigation, it is
interesting to note the recent findings by Ozcan and Greenstein (2013) of decreasing concentration of
inventive activity among firms in this technology category. We see increased geographic concentration
in patenting across all other technological categories, including Chemical, Drugs & Medical, Electrical
and Electronic, and Mechanical. We see that the interaction of internet is associated with reduced
geographic concentration for these categories too. This is particularly interesting in light of the findings
for Electrical and Electronic industries, the area closest to computing and communications. This suggests
no simple explanation will suffice, not one that stresses simple differences between hardware and
software or upstream and downstream industries. This is another important question for future work.

Conclusion
We have explored the geographic concentration of invention. We first find evidence that

suggests that the geographic concentration of patenting increased from 1990-95 to 2000-05. Overall
patenting grew 27% but patenting in the top quartile of counties grew 50%. While this result seems to
contrast with work in the convergence literature, we emphasize the use of different methods and the
importance of the very top of the patenting distribution in our findings. Then we showed that advanced
internet adoption by businesses works against the general increase in the geographic concentration of
patenting, leading to different experiences across the regions of the United States. We find that the
correlation is strong for distant collaborations and disappears for nearby collaborations and for noncollaborative patents, which suggests that the internet’s availability and growth drove at least part of
the overall reduction in the growth in concentration of invention.
As noted above, our analysis helps us understand the net impact of two fundamental changes in
the years since the publication of Vannevar Bush’s Science: The Endless Frontier: (1) globalization and its
implications for innovation and invention as a source of regional competitiveness, and (2) the impact of
the internet and associated reductions in communication and coordination costs. Our results suggest
that while the net effect of these changes on the concentration of innovation is positive, internet
technology has played a role in mitigating this effect.
Our analysis contains a number of limitations that limit the generalizability of our findings. First,
we study one type of invention, patenting, in a particular time period. The internet might have increased
patenting but not invention, for example by simplifying the process of applying for a patent through
internet lawyers rather than causing any increase in invention per se. Hence, our results beg questions
about whether other measures of invention – e.g., non-patented inventions, new product development,
entrepreneurial founding in technologically intensive markets – follow a similar pattern.
20

In addition, and as mentioned, our findings are consistent with two different explanations. First,
it could be the causal explanation, perhaps by allowing relatively isolated inventors to collaborate with
inventors located elsewhere. Second, it could be driven by an omitted variable that caused both
increased patenting and internet adoption. For example, for counties that were not leaders in patenting
in the early 1990s, internet adoption might be a symptom rather than a cause of increased attention to
invention and a growth in the rate of internet adoption by firms. While the results on distant
collaboration vs non-collaborative patents are suggestive, they are not definitive. Hence, our findings
beg questions about how to instrument for internet adoption to identify truly exogenous variation
across the US.
Notwithstanding these limitations, our results here, combined with prior work on the impact of
the internet on the concentration of economic activity, suggest that the impact can depend on the
particular activity and context being studied. It seems to lead to increased concentration in wages
(Forman, Goldfarb, and Greenstein 2012) and hospital efficiency (Dranove, Forman, Goldfarb, and
Greenstein 2013), but a decreased concentration in retailing (Choi and Bell 2011), and, as suggested
above, in patenting and invention. Those findings also raise intriguing questions about whether the
internet’s impact on the geographic concentration of invention is distinct from its impact on the
geographic concentration of other economic activity, such as wages, business adoption of IT, hospital
productivity, and so on. If that is the case, then the internet could act as a broad force for weakening the
links between the geography of inventive activity and spatial patterns of downstream use of it. We
speculate that such a broad trend, if sustained for a long time period, would manifest in numerous
measurable economic activities. Hence, our findings also motivate questions comparing changes in the
geographic concentration of different parts of the value chain over the very long run.
