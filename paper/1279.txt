Optimal Wage Re—Negotiation

ABSTRACT

This paper investigates an economy in which there are short—term wage

contracts that are re—negotiated under certain conditions. This paper
determines the optimal frequency of wage re—negotiation and shows that it

depends positively on asures of aggregate variability and Phillips curve
slope. The role of optimal wage re—negotiation is to mitigate the output
effects of various shocks. In the context of an open economy, it is shown
that the desirable exchange rate regime in an economy with optimal wage
re—negotiation depends on the stochastic structure of the economy.

I. Introduction
Recent analyses, such as those by FIsher (1977) and Gray (1976), have
focused attention on the role of wage contracts in explaining short—term

dynamics. A wage contract builds a short—term rigidity into the system,
fixing the money wage in the short run. To analyze the influence exerted by
the limited flexibility of such contracts some authors have investigated the
role of partial indexation. 1

In these studies, the analysis has been

shifted to more normative aspects, and attention has been given to the
"optimal" flexibility of wage contracts, i.e., to the optimal degree of wage

indexation. One criterion used in these analyses has been to consider as a
benchmark the output in a fully flexible economy, and to derive as optimal the

indexation scheme that would bring actual output "closest" to the fully

flexible economy output. Such a procedure Implicitly assumes the existence of
costs that prevent the instantaneous adjustment of the labor market In order

to regain its equilibrium. However the analysis does not treat the effects of
those costs on the optimal contracting scheme. This paper attempts to model
the role of adjustment costs in the wage scheme by focusing attention on the

possibility of contract re—negotiation. We expect to observe re—contracting
if its benefit exceeds its costs. The analysis will consider the optimal
degree of wage re-contracting, and will contrast it with the optimal degree of
wage indexation.

In a recent contribution, Flood and Marion demonstrated that in an open
economy under optimal wage indexation, In a world of one good, floating rates
are preferred to fixed rates, regardless of the stochastic structure of the

economy. This paper will consider how this conclusion is modified if the
limited wage flexibility is due to optimal wage re—negotiation instead of

optimal wage indexaion. We find that the two wage adjustment schemes differ

—2—

considerably, in the closed as well as in the open economy.

Section LI determines optimai wage re—negotiation in a closed economy.
Section III extends the discussion to an open economy, under both fixed and
floating rates, and investigates the desirable exchange rate regime under

optimal wage re—negotiation. Section IV closes the paper by discussing the
implications of the findings.

II. Optimal Re—contracting in a Closed Economy
Consider a closed economy characterized by the existence of short—term

labor contracts that pre—set the wage. Such contracts occur because the
transaction costs of wage negotiation make them beneficial. This argument
implies, however, that in some circumstances we expect the benefit from re—

contracting to exceed the costs, making re—negotiation desirable. Thus, there
is a cost benefit element in assessing the desirability of wage re-

negotiation. The purpose of this section is to model this case in order to
arrive at an optimal re—contracting scheme.

Consider an economy in which nominal wage contracts for period t are
negotiated in period t—1, before current prices are known, so as to equate

expected labor demand to expected labor supply. Such a contract contains two

parts. First, it pre—sets the wage. Second, it specifies the conditions
under which re—contracting will occur. These conditions exist when the real
wage resulting from the co.ntract deviates too much" from the market clearing
wage in a flexible economy.

More formally, consider an economy where the labor supply (la) is given
by

(1)

l =

(w

—

—3—

where w and t are the money wage and money prices, expressed in logarithms.
The production function is given by:

where

labor market clears at a real wage

Let us denote actual wage, prices, and output by (we,

For each

period, there are two subcases. Let us consider first the case in which the
contract wage is binding. We denote wages, prices and output in this case by

(we, p,

.

Next,

let us consider the case in which re—contracting

occurs. In such a case we denote wages, prices and output by (,

'j, ) .

Suppose that the contract money wage is set such as to equate the
expected real wage resulting from the contract to the expected real wage in a

flexible economy (tn)

The analysis assumes also that in case of re—contracting the real wage is
set at its market clearing level,

II>k

The policy question addressed in this section is the optimal value of
k. Another possible version of such a model allows for partial wage
indexation as part of the contract agreement. This possibility has been
analyzed by previous authors; the purpose of the current analysis is to
consider the difference between optimal indexation and optimal re—negotiation

schemes. Thus, the analysis will assume the absence of wage indexation and
will contrast the different natures of the two schemes at a later point. We
assume that contracts are made because there are real output costs associated

—5—

with re—negotiation, making a continuous market clearing a second best

possibility. If those costs are C, the output in case of re—negotiation is

given by y — C (where y is the output in a fully flexible economy).3 Thus,
actual output

is given by:

— C

if ktI>k

The notion here is that the cost of pre—setting the wage ahead of time (a
wage contract) is negligible relative to the costs of last—minute wage
revision (given by C).4

Next, following Gray, it is also assumed that there are costs associated

with the divergence from the flexible equilibrium output. A possible loss
function to describe these costs is:

where d = (S.h.log h) I ((1—h)+1), d1 = 1/(1—h),d2

The existence of wage contracts implies that unexpected price increases

reduce real wages, increasing employment and output. In such a case, the
price level is given by:

occur. Realized output in such a case is given by

Notice that in case of re—contracting the Phillips curve effect is nil,
and realized output is equal to frictionless output (the first term in eq. 12)

minus the cost of re—contracting. Price level is given in such a case by:

—

A comparison of eq. 11 and 13 reveals that if the contract binds (eq.
11), the effect of the Phillips curve is to mitigate the price effect of a
given monetary shock because of the induced output effect.

reduce the use of re—contracting (a higher k*). A larger slope of the

Phillips curve will magnify deviations from the output target, encouraging re-

negotiation (a lower k*). Notice that if the transaction costs associated
with re—contracting are zero, k* = 0, implying that the labor market clears

continuously, nullifying the role of wage contracts. For the optimal k, the
frequency of wage re—negotiation is measured by

2 cD(—z), where z = k

Suppose that we increase uniformly the volatility of all the shocks
affecting the economy, without affecting the relative importance of the

underlying shocks (i.e. holding V,!Vu given). In such a case we find from
eq.20 that

Higher volatility of the shocks will increase the desirability of re—
contracting, because more frequently the labor market pressure is enough to

justify it. The effect of this adjustment is to increase output volatility
(relative to

,

i.e.

L) by less than the increase in the volatility of the

underlying shocks. In this sense, optimal re—contracting mitigates the
effects of higher aggregate volatility on output variability.

Comparing an optimal re—contracting policy to an optimal indexation7
reveals that the optimal frequency of re—contracting depends on aggregate
volatility (V0) whereas optimal indexation depends only on the relative

importance of the real and monetary shocks (i.e. on Vv/Vu) As a result,
optimal indexation is homogenous of degree zero and output volatility under
optimal indexation is homogenous of degree one with respect to aggregate

—10--

volatility. In contrast we have just demonstrated that a given increase in
aggregate volatility will increase output volatility at a lower rate under the
re—contracting

.

The Appendix considers the case in which we allow for optimal wage
indexation as well as optimal wage re—contracting. It turns out that the
characteristics of possible wage schemes described above stay intact in a

system that allows for both adjustment possibilities. Adding optimal wage
indexation has the effect of reducing aggregate volatility, reducing in turn

the use of re—contracting (dz* > 0). Optimal indexation, however, proves to
be independent of optimal re—contracting.

III.

Optimal Re—contracting in an Open Economy
The purpose of this section is to analyze how optimal re—contracting

works in an open economy. This will enable us to evaluate the desirability of
different exchange rate regimes. A recent contribution by Flood and Marion
has demonstrated that under optimal wage indexation, in a world of one good,
floating rates are preferred over fixed rates, regardless of the stochastic

structure of the shocks affecting the economy.8 As Section II concluded,
optimal wage indexation differs considerably from optimal wage re—contracting.
This section shows that this difference manifests itself also in the choice of

optimal exchange rate regimes. It turns out that under optimal wage re—
contracting regimes, the ranking

of

exchange rate regimes depends on the

stochastic structure of the shocks. Thus, unlike the case under optimal wage
indexation, we cannot rank exchange rate regimes under optimal wage re—
contracting without further information regarding the relative magnitude of

the shocks affecting the economy. This circumstance also suggests that the
ranking of exchange rate regimes might depend on the labor market structure.

Consider the case of a small, open economy under perfect capital

mobility, in a world of one traded good. The labor market has the structure
described in Section II (eq.1—7).

The floating exchange rate regime

Under the floating exchange rate regime the money supply is exogenously

and real shocks increases because under floating rates the exchange rate

adjustment mitigates the effect of those shocks. The relative desirability of
a fixed exchange rate goes up with the volatility of the domestic money supply

output from the volatility of foreign interest rates and the domestic money
supply.

Implications

The existence of wage contracts introduces wage rigidity Into the economy
because it limits the capacity of wages to adjust to contemporaneous shocks.

Two possible channels that allow limited wage flexibility are partial wage

indexation and the possibility of wage re—contracting. This paper has focused

—14—

on the properties of optimal wage re—contracting, contrasting wage re—

contracting with wage indexation. The main difference between the two is that
the optimal frequency of wage re—contracting depends on measures of aggregate

volatility and not on the relative importance of various shocks. In contrast,
optimal wage indexation depends on the relative importance of various shocks,

and not on measures of absolute volatility. The paper shows that the optimal
frequency of wage re—contracting depends positively on aggregate volatility

and the Phillips curve slope. The role of optimal re—contracting is to
mitigate the output effects of various shocks. In the context of an open
economy the difference between optimal wage indexation and optimal wage re—
contracting is manifested in the fact that the desirability of various
exchange rate regimes under optimal wage re—contracting depends on the
stochastic structure of the economy, whereas under optimal wage indexation
Flood and Marion(1982) have shown that in a world of one good floating rates

are preferred, regardless of the stochastic structure. The paper shows that
under optimal wage re—contracting floating rates become more desirable when
the volatility of foreign prices and real supply shocks increases and when the
volatility of the domestic money supply and of foreign interest rates
slackens.

—15—

Appendix

The purpose of this Appendix is to consider how the analysis in the paper

is affected if we allow also for wage indexation.11 It turns out that adding
the possibility of optimal wage indexation to a system with optimal wage re—

contracting has the effect of reducing the frequency of re—contracting. The
value of optimal indexation, however, is independent of optimal re—contracting
(k*), and it is equal to optimal indexation in an economy without re—

contracting. This is a result of the fact that optimal indexation depends on
relative variances in the underlying shocks and not on measures of aggregate
volatility, whereas optimal use of re—contracting depends on aggregate

volatility. Because allowing optimal re—contracting does not affect the
relative importance of the underlying shocks, it does not affect the value of
optimal indexation.

Allowing for a partial indexation in a framework with wage re—contracting
implies that the wage equation (eq. 4) is modified to:

w =

(Tn)

The fixed cost of re—negotiation is, assumed not to affect the
marginal product of labor. Thus, y — C is a logarithmic
approximation of the output around tie non—stochastic equilibrium.

The assumption of an asymmetric cost of negotiation structure is
crucial for the explanation of the wage contract advanced in this
paper. It states that negotiation for setting the current wage
(we) within the period is costly relative to a negotiation which
sets the current wage ahead of time (at the end of t—1). Notice that
because of the stochastic structure used in the paper the contract
wage is time—independent, therefore the above assumption of cost—
asymmetry is natural. In general, the wage contract might be time—
dependent, and the above asymmetry can be the result of the costs of
collecting and processing current information (cost of survey, etc. )
needed for re—contracting. In contrast, pre—setting the wage ahead
of time requires only well—known, costless information. If all
negotiations were equallly expensive, then we would observe no wage
stickiness. The modeling of the nature of the cost asymmetry is left
