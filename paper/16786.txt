The Effects of Tax Shocks on Output: Not So Large, But Not Small Either

NBER Working Paper No. 16786
February 2011
JEL No. E62,H20,H60
ABSTRACT
In a seminal contribution, Romer and Romer (2010) (RR henceforth) estimate GDP tax multipliers
of up to -3 after 3 years. These results have been criticized as implausibly large. For instance, Favero
and Giavazzi (2010) (FG henceforth) argue RR's specification cannot be interpreted as a proper (truncated)
moving average representation of the output process. They show that when the system is estimated
in its VAR form, or its correct truncated MA representation, a unit realization of the RR shock has
much smaller effects on GDP than in RR, typically about - .5 percentage points of GDP. I argue that
on theoretical grounds the discretionary component of taxation should be allowed to have different
effects than the automatic response of tax revenues to macroeconomic variables; existing approaches,
including FG's, that do not allow for this difference, exhibit impulse responses that are biased towards
0. I show that the correct impulse responses to a RR tax shock are about half-way between the large
effects estimated by RR and the much smaller effects estimated by FG: typically, a one percentage
point of GDP increase in taxes leads to a decline in GDP by about 1.5 percentage points after 3 years.
I also create two new datasets of tax shocks, one based on receipts and the other on liabilities; in these
datasets, I distinguish between different types of taxes (personal, corporate, indirect, and social security)
and their subcomponents.

Introduction

In a seminal paper, Romer and Romer (2010) (henceforth, RR) construct measures of tax
changes based on the original documentation accompanying tax bills, and show that they
have large negative e¤ects on output: an exogenous increase in taxes by 1 percentage point
of GDP can lead to a decline in GDP by 3 percentage points after three years.
These magnitudes have been criticized as implausibly large. Favero and Giavazzi (2010)
(henceforth, FG) challenge the speci…cation used by RR, arguing that it cannot be interpreted as a proper (truncated) moving average representation of the output process. They
show that when the system is estimated in its VAR form, or its correct truncated MA representation, a unit realization of the RR shock has much smaller e¤ects on GDP, typically
about - .5 percentage points.
I argue that, on theoretical grounds, one should expect the discretionary component of
tax changes to have stronger e¤ects on output than the component capturing the endogenous
response of taxes to, say, output ‡uctuations. If this is the case, I show that the approaches of
FG (2010) and of Blanchard and Perotti (2002) (henceforth, BP) generate impulse responses
that are biased towards zero. By adopting a VAR approach that allows for a di¤erent impact
of the discretionary and endogenous components of taxation, I show that the estimated e¤ects
of a tax change is larger (in absolute value) than that estimated by FG, although smaller
than that estimated by RR. Now a one percentage point of GDP increase in taxation is
typically associated with a decline in GDP by about 1.5 percentage point after three years.
Following Mertens and Ravn (2009) (henceforth, MR) I decompose the changes to current
taxation into anticipated and unanticipated changes. If individuals are liquidity constrained,
the responses to the two components should be the same. I show that this is indeed approximately the case. I then apply the same decomposition to shocks to future taxation, and I
show that the results of MR on the e¤ects of changes to future expected taxation are mostly
due to the anticipated component.
2

I also extend the RR dataset in several dimensions. Conceptually, for some purposes
data on liabilities are called for, while for other purposes data on receipts might be more
appropriate. I construct two datasets based on these two di¤erent concepts. I also track the
quarterly changes in receipts generated by each tax bill, and I distinguish between di¤erent
types of taxes (personal, corporate, indirect, social security) and several subcomponents of
each of these.
The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the new dataset. Section 3
presents an overview of the construction and properties of the RR measure of discretionary
tax changes. Section 4 presents several speci…cations used to estimate the e¤ects of discretionary taxation, and introduces the speci…cation I use to accommodate di¤erences in the
e¤ects of the discretionary and endogenous changes in tax revenues. Section 5 summarizes
these speci…cations. Estimation results are discussed in section 6. Section 7 presents a
test of the assumption of this paper, that the discretionary and automatic components of
taxation have di¤erent e¤ects. Section 8 discusses the results of decomposing changes to
current taxation into anticipated and surprise changes. Section 9 applies the same decomposition to changes to future taxation. Section 10 presents some robustness checks. Section
11 concludes.

Data description

I extend the RR data in several dimensions, and in some cases I use somewhat di¤erent rules
to record the tax changes. In what follows, I detail the main features of my dataset and the
main di¤erences with the RR dataset.1
1. I collect data on total tax revenues, and also on individual, corporate, indirect, and
social security taxes separately, and on their subcomponents, as described in Table 1.

The detailed dataset is available on my website.

The distinction between the four main categories of taxes is clear and meaningful; data on
the subcomponents are not always as reliable. In this paper, which focuses on methodological
issues, I aggregate all taxes in one measure of total tax revenues.2
2. RR refer to their data as representing "liabilities". They take the …rst full (calendar
of …scal) year e¤ect of the tax change as the e¤ect of a tax measure. However, for many
tax bills only the e¤ects on receipts are documented. In other cases, the sources report
both the change in liabilities and receipts. The di¤erence between receipts and liabilities
can re‡ect slow take-up, information and collection lags, tax evasion, and several other
factors. Depending on the question, receipts or liabilities might be the more appropriate
concept; hence, whenever possible, I collect data on both. When only receipts or liabilities
are available, I convert one into the other using the methodology described below.
In recording liabilities, I follow the same methodology used by RR, i.e. I record the
…rst full year e¤ect as the e¤ect of the tax measure. In recording receipts, I try to track the
exogenous quarterly change. The methodology is described more fully below.
Note that, because I disaggregate the total e¤ect into di¤erent components and subcomponents, and because I record both liabilities and receipts, I had to redo the RR dataset
2

Since the dataset is based on budget documents, obviously it covers, like the RR dataset, only federal
tax revenues.

from the beginning, sometimes using di¤erent sources. This accounts for the di¤erent totals
relative to the RR dataset.
3. The main di¤erences with the RR dataset are as follows.
1) I track the starting date of each individual component within a given tax bill. For
instance, for the 1982 Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act, RR give a single number,
$26.4bn, starting 1983:1. In the liability dataset, I have 17 di¤erent items, with starting
dates varying from 1983:1 to 1984:1.
2) As mentioned, RR typically report the e¤ect of a tax legislation as the …rst full year
e¤ect after enactment, and take it as the starting date of the measure. In some cases,
this procedure does not capture correctly the impact of tax legislation on tax receipts and
liabilities. For instance, changes to depreciation allowances, to the investment tax credit and
to capital gains taxation can present a highly irregular behavior over time. Legislation that
allows for accelerated depreciation causes a large change in the time pro…le of receipts, but
a small change in their present discounted value: receipts decline initially, only to increase
later. Using the …rst full-year e¤ect would therefore provide a distorted picture of the e¤ects
of the tax measure.3
3) Even aside from the cases above, the e¤ect of a tax measure in the …rst …scal or calendar
year after enactment is often much smaller than the e¤ect in later years. On the other hand,
there is a normal trend increase in the e¤ect due to the assumed exogenous increase in GDP
over time. Hence, I adopt the rule that, if in …scal year x+1 receipts are di¤erent from
year x by a factor of more than 30 percent, I display a change in x+1:1. By convention,
the change is assumed to be in the …rst quarter, unless there is speci…c information that
indicates otherwise.
4) By breaking down each tax bill into its components, I can trace which parts of the bill
3

In the …rst 10 to 15 years of the sample, typically the sources report only the full-year e¤ect of the tax
measures; but starting around 1960, they often report receipts (and in some cases liabilities) over a longer
horizon, from 5 years to –in the nineties –up to 10 years ahead.

5

were merely extensions of existing measures and therefore did not lead to an actual change
in receipts or liabilities.
Thus, I end up with the following classi…cation of tax changes, summarized in Table 2.
A tax change is "legislated, unanticipated" ("LU" in the last column of the table) if the tax
change is legislated within 90 days after enactment, and receipts or liabilities start within 90
days after the legislated tax change (row 1). It is "legislated, anticipated" ("LA") if either
the tax change is legislated to go into e¤ect within 90 days from enactment, but receipts
or liabilities start more than 90 days after the legislated change (row 2.); or the legislated
change starts more than 90 days after enactment (rows 2, 3 and 4). A tax change is "non
legislated, anticipated" ("NLA") if it is not associated with a legislated change, and follows
from the application of the 30 percent rule (rows 5 and 6). This classi…cation generates two
datasets: in the …rst I keep track only of changes that are explicitly legislated, i.e. of the
…rst two categories, "LU" and "LA". In the second I also include the third category, "NLA",
i.e. changes in receipts that are captured by the 30 percent rule. The results in this paper
are based on this second de…nition; the di¤erence with the narrower de…nition are minor.
RR (2010) use only legislated changes; MR (2009) also use only legislated changes, and
distinguish between anticipated and unanticipated.

For receipts, I try to track the exogenous quarterly changes determined by a tax
6

measure. Some sources not used by RR, most notably the Survey of Current Business,
display the quarterly e¤ects (as opposed to the annual e¤ects used by RR) of the di¤erent
tax measures. I use these sources to track quarterly changes, and I complement them with
a speci…c methodology to infer quarterly changes in receipts from annual data on liabilities
or receipts.
First, I keep track of changes in withholding rates for individuals. If these change at
the time of enactment, I assume that receipts track liabilities from the time of enactment,
unless receipt data indicate otherwise. If withholding rates are not changed immediately,
some or all of these liabilities are paid in quarter 1 and 2 of the next calendar year, when
tax declarations are …led and net settlements are carried out.4
For corporations, I convert liabilities into receipts, and yearly receipts into quarterly
receipts, using the legislation in place in each year determining the timing of tax payments
by corporations. These rules are complicated, also because they depend on the choice of the
tax year. Most corporations (currently about 85 percent) choose the calendar tax year, and
I will present results for this case. Presently, calendar year corporations are required to pay
their CY x estimated liabilities in four equal installments in CY x. But these rules have
changed over time. Until 1949 corporations paid 25 percent of their year x tax liability in
each of the quarters of year x+1. In 1950 a new system was introduced, whereby corporations
would move gradually to a payment of 50 percent of their year x tax liability in each of the
…rst two quarters of year x+1; the transition lasted until 1954. But in 1954 a new system
was again adopted: by 1959, a corporation would pay 25 percent of estimated tax liability
for year x in each of quarters 3 and 4 of year x, and quarters 1 and 2 of year x+1. Any
di¤erence between estimated and actual tax liabilities would be paid or credited in March
and June of year x+1. In the new system adopted in 1964, corporations would eventually
pay 25 percent of their estimated year x liability in each quarter of year x. The transition
was accelerated in 1966, so that the new system was fully operational in 1967.
4

When the source reports the quarterly pattern of receipts, this is indeed the pattern that one observes.

7

Table 3 summarizes the rules in place in di¤erent years, determining when a dollar of
liabilities on corporate income received in CY x would be paid. There are four regimes,
separated by a transition trajectory from each other. I will assume that Regime 1 lasts until
1950 included, Regime 2 from 1951 to 1957, Regime 3 from 1958 to 1965, and Regime 4 from
1966 onwards.

Each cell displays the percentage of the income earned in the
"Income year" to be paid in the quarter indicated by the cell.

5. These rules are important not only to calculate the correct time path of receipts, but
also the retroactive components. Several tax changes have retroactive components, i.e. they
apply to a period before the time of enactment. RR assume that all retroactive liabilities
8

are paid in one installments in the …rst quarter after enactment. This is the assumption I
also make for the liability dataset. In reality, individuals and corporations pay retroactive
liabilities in a variety of ways.
Individuals typically pay retroactive liabilities in the …rst two quarters of the …rst calendar
year after enactment, when …ling tax returns, although di¤erent laws sometimes specify
di¤erent timings. As an example, suppose a law is signed on October 1 of calendar year
(CY) x, and it is retroactive to January 1 of year x; suppose that the withholding rates
were changed immediately on enactment. The source reports an e¤ect on receipts in …scal
year5 (FY) x+1 of $1400mn, thus FY x+1 contains 7 quarters worth of receipts: the three
retroactive quarters x:1 to x:3, all paid in x+1:1 and x+1:2, and the four non-retroactive
quarters x:4 to x+1:3. Hence, the annualized retroactive component is 1400*(3/7)*(4/2) =
$1200mn, to be attributed to each of x+1:1 and x+1:2, while the annualized non-retroactive
component is 1400*(4/7)*(4/4) = $800mn, to be attributed to each quarter starting x:4.
Suppose instead the tax measure was enacted on July 1 of CY x, retroactive to January 1
of the same year. Suppose again that withholding rates are adjusted immediately. Receipts
in FY x contain one quarter’s worth of receipts, the non-retroactive receipts paid in x:3. The
retroactive part (two quarters’worth of receipts) is again paid in x+1:1 and x+1:2. Hence we
have to sum the e¤ects from FY x and FY x+1: this sum contains again 7 quarters worth of
data. Suppose this sum is again $1400mn. The retroactive part is now two quarters, spread
over x+1:1 and x+1:2; hence it is 1400*(2/7)*(4/2) = $800mn; the non-retroactive part is
5 quarters, spread over 5 quarters: hence 1400*(5/7)*(4/5) = $800mn. The point of this
second example is that sometimes one needs the sum of the e¤ects in the …rst two …scal years
to compute the retroactive component.
Take the case of the 1950 Revenue Act. It was enacted on September 23, 1950, retroactive
to July 1, 1950. In CY 1951, calendar year corporations would pay their CY 1950 liabilities
5

From 1975, …scal year x starts on October 1 of calendar year x-1. Before 1975, a …scal year started on
July 1 of year x-1.

in four equal installments. The e¤ect on full year liabilities was estimated to be $1500mn. I
calculate the CY 1951 e¤ect on receipts as follows. The retroactive component is one quarter,
hence one fourth of $1500mn, to be paid over four quarters of CY 1951. Hence the quarterly
annualized retroactive e¤ect on receipts in CY 1951 is $375mn. The non-retroactive e¤ect is
also $375mn. From 1952:1, the e¤ect on receipts is the full-year e¤ect on liabilities, $1500mn.
Now take the case of the corporate tax rate increases in the 1993 Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act. It was enacted on August 10, 1993, retroactive to January 1, 1993. The
…rst reported e¤ect on receipts is $4400mn for FY 1994. This includes 7 quarters worth of
receipts: 3 quarters of retroactive e¤ects, and 4 quarters of non-retroactive e¤ects. Under the
rules in place in 1993, calendar year corporations would have to pay changes in their CY 1993
tax liability in equal installments in the remaining quarters of CY 1993. Hence, in this case
all the retroactive component would have to be paid in 1993:4. This implies a annualized
retroactive e¤ect on receipts in 1993:4 of 4400*(3/7)*4 = $7550mn. The non-retroactive
component, that also starts in 1993:4, is 4400*(1/7)*4 = $2517mn.
Consider instead another example, from the 2002 Jobs Creation and Workers Assistance
Act. This act was signed on March 9, 2002, and its provisions on accelerated depreciation
applied to all capital put in place after September 10, 2001. The decrease in revenues of
the retroactive component (2 quarters’ worth of receipts) was implemented in three equal
installments in 2002:2, 2002:3, and 2002:4. Over the same period taxes would decrease also
because of the non-retroactive component, over the last three quarters of CY 2002. Because
these quarters span two di¤erent …scal years, one needs FY 2002 and FY 2003 estimates
to compute the e¤ects. The sum of FY 2002 and FY 2003 receipts contains 8 quarters’
worth of receipts: 2 are retroactive (and received in the last three quarters of CY 2003).and
6 are non-retroactive. Since the sum of FY 2002 and FY 2003 receipts is -35239-32738 =
-$67976mn, the annualized retroactive component is (-67976)/8*2*(4/3) = -$22659mn, in
1992:2, 1992:Q3 and 1992:4. The annualized non-retroactive component is (-67976)/8*4 =
-$33989mn, in all quarters from enactment.

Estimates of discretionary taxation

Narrative estimates of tax changes are based on "discretionary" changes in taxation (also
sometimes called changes in "cyclically adjusted" revenues, or "…scal impulse"). Discretionary changes in taxation are meant to capture the intentional action of policymakers, as
opposed to the automatic e¤ects of the cycle on revenues. In this section, I introduce the
notation and describe the construction of measures of discretionary taxation.
To understand this notion, it is useful to start from the following question: what would tax
revenues be if they changed only because of the automatic e¤ects of movements in output?
Denote the log of this hypothetical level of revenues by Set ; the logs of actual revenues and
output by St and Yt ; respectively, and the elasticity of revenues to output by . Then

The di¤erence St

Set = St

1

+ (Yt

(1)

Yt 1 )

Set , which I denote by dt=t ; is the change in revenues we would observe

if output had remained constant at its reference level Yt 1 ; in other words, it is the change
in revenues that is not explained by the change in output from Yt

1

to Yt . This di¤erence

is what is usually referred to as the "discretionary change in taxation". Thus, if Di=j is the
log level of discretionary taxation at date i as estimated at date j; the discretionary change
in taxation dt=t is:
dt=t

Dt=t
= St

(4)

If one has an outside estimate of the elasticity ; the standard procedure to estimate dt=t
is precisely to subtract from the actual change in revenues the change in output, and

11

possibly other determinants of revenues like in‡ation, each multiplied by its own elasticity.
Conceptually, this is what BP (2002) do, except that they use innovations estimated from a
VAR rather than actual changes in revenues and output.
RR (2010) turn this procedure around by starting from estimates of dt=t as provided by
o¢ cial documents, and based on the speci…c provisions of each tax bill enacted by Congress.
Let this estimate be dbt=t ; hence the actual change in revenues can be decomposed into the

discretionary change in taxation plus a second component, consisting of the automatic
response of revenues to changes in output and a white noise error:
St

St

where yt is the log change of output, Yt
2

= dbt=t + yt +
Yt 1 ; and

t

t

(5)

is i.i.d. with mean 0 and variance

: From now on, I will drop the hat "b" from dbt=t ; as it will be evident that I will refer

to the measure constructed using the RR methodology and not to the measure obtained as
the di¤erence between the actual revenue change and yt : Also, and with a slight abuse of
terminology, I will call the term yt +

t

the "endogenous component".

How is dt=t constructed in practice? A law enacted at time t speci…es a path of revisions to
discretionary taxation, from time t onward: Dt=t Dt=t 1 ; Dt+1=t Dt+1=t 1 ; Dt+2=t Dt+2=t

1

up to time t + M; where M is the maximum horizon for a law (of course, many of these
revisions will be 0).6
Let ut=t

i

be the di¤erence between the revisions of the expectation of discretionary

In practice, I set M = 20; this leaves out only a few tax tax changes that occurred more than 20 quarters
after enactment on the bill. Speci…cally, …ve reductions of the telephone excise tax set by the P.L. 91-614 of
1970 for 1976, 1977, 1978, and 1979, each for $160mn; the end of the repeal of the 1985 and 1986 increases
in accelerated cost recovery deductions, set by the 1982 TEFRA for 1988, for a total of $15.9bn; and the
imcrease in the social security tax rate decided in 1972:3 for 1978:1, for $3.3bn.

Alternative models of the e¤ects of discretionary
taxation

The key methodological point of this paper is that, when estimating the e¤ects of changes in
revenues, one should allow the discretionary component dt=t and the endogenous component
yt +

t

to have di¤erent e¤ects on output.

One can think of dt=t as capturing mostly

changes to tax rates, rules about deductions, tax credits, depreciation, etc.; the endogenous
component, yt +

t;

captures instead the automatic e¤ects of deviations of output from its

reference level, which occur without any intervention on the part of the policymaker10 , plus
an error term.
There are at least two reasons why a change to the discretionary component should have
a di¤erent e¤ect on output than a change to the endogenous component. First, it is more
distortionary, since it consists of changes in tax rates and tax rules. Second, it is more
persistent; in fact, if deviations of output from its reference level sum to 0 over the cycle
(such as when the reference level is trend output or potential output), and if agents are
not liquidity constrained, then the non-discretionary component of taxation should have no
e¤ect on the agents’behavior.
An important caveat is that a change in tax rates could also a¤ect the elasticity :
and therefore it could contaminate the estimation of the discretionary and the endogenous
9

In addition, they could easily be serially correlated. In fact, dt 1=t 1 contains terms like ut 1=t 1 which
is likely to be correlated with the term ut=t 1 appearing in the de…nition of dt=t : the same law approved in
t 1 can decide changes in discretionary taxation for t and t 1. Empirically, as we will see dt=t is not
serially correlated, because tax laws are few and far between.
10
Of course, the distinction is not so clear-cut as it might appear: one could object that the policymaker
could always have prevented, by a suitable change in rules, the automatic e¤ect of the deviation of output
from its reference level.

components. Observe, however, that if taxes are proportional a change in tax rates does
not a¤ect the elasticity : Hence, this e¤ect is likely to be second order. One could also
argue that, as output changes over the cycle, so does the elasticity of tax revenues, because
individuals are moved into di¤erent tax brackets. Hence a purely cyclical source of changes
in revenues could impact on the behavior of individuals. This e¤ect too is likely to be second
order. In the end, any measure of the elasticity of tax revenues, whether estimated as here
or constructed from the tax code as international organizations do, is bound to be a¤ected
by measurement error.

4.1

A small model with di¤erentiated e¤ects of discretionary taxation

To put it all together, I consider a minimalist model of output that however has all the
ingredients one needs. As in RR (2010), initially I will assume that there is no anticipation
e¤ect from expectations of changes in future taxation.
Thus, I assume that the "true" model includes an equation for the log change in tax
revenues
st = dt=t + yt +

and an equation for the log change in output11

equation (10) reduces to

Obviously this is a simpli…ed model; in the empirical application I will allow for more endogenous

Under the identifying assumptions of RR (2010), if one estimates equation (13) by regressing yt on yt 1 ; dt=t and dt=t 1 ; the resulting estimates will be biased and inconsistent,
because

t 1

is correlated with yt 1 . One can obtain consistent estimates by taking

its lag out of the error term. An estimated series for

RR (2010) estimate two versions of (12). The benchmark speci…cation includes lags 0 to 12 of dt=t and
no lagged endogenous variable. The second speci…cation includes also lags 1 to 4 of yt : They interpret both
speci…cations as truncated versions of the MA representation; see below for a discussion.
13
MR (2009) estimate a version of this speci…cation that also includes expected changes to future discretionary taxation (see below), in addition to other endogenous variables. They do not allow for di¤erent
e¤ects of discretionary taxation and the remaining component, hence they estimate the equation by OLS.

and past values of

t.

To …x ideas, I will call an OLS estimate of (13), i.e. a regression of yt on yt 1 ; dt=t and
dt

1=t 1

of

t

"OLS estimate of the MR speci…cation"; if the regressors also include the estimates

and

t 1,

I will call this, with some impropriety, "IV estimate of the MR speci…cation".

It should also be clear that in general one would want to estimate a multidimensional
system of equations, instead of just the output equation. Suppose that tax revenues respond
automatically not only to output, but also to in‡ation:
st = dt=t + yt +

t

If there is no equation for in‡ation, the term

t

(14)

and its …rst lag would end up in the

error term of the output equation. Thus, I will estimate a version of the model that includes
also the log change of government spending per capita, the change in the in‡ation rate, and
the change in the interest rate as endogenous variables. These variables also appear in the
revenue equation (14), and their lags 1 to 4 are used as instruments.

4.2

Relation with Favero and Giavazzi (2010)

FG (2010) argue that one should estimate a VAR in yt and st (plus the other endogenous
variables, omitted here and in what follows for expository purposes) with dt=t as an exogenous
term:

I will call (17) and (18) the "FG speci…cation".
If equations (17) and (18) are estimated by an OLS regression of yt and st on yt 1 ; st
and dt=t ; as in FG (2010),14 once again the resulting estimates are inconsistent, because
is correlated with both yt

1

t 1

and st 1 : The …rst source of the correlation is the same as in the

MR speci…cation above. There is now also a second source, instead of using dt

1=t 1

as in the

true model, this speci…cation uses st 1 , which is obviously positively correlated with

t 1:

As I show below, OLS FG impulse responses deliver consistently weaker negative output
e¤ects than OLS MR impulse responses.
Once again, consistent estimates can be obtained by taking

t

and

t 1

out of the error

term, leading to IV estimates of the FG speci…cation. In fact, it is easy to show that the IV
FG responses are identically equal to the IV MR responses if one uses the same instruments
for (9).
Note that when

4.3

Predetermined dt=t

Now assume that dt=t is not unpredictable.

There are at least two reasons why dt=t can

be predetermined. First, as pointed out by FG (2010), by selecting those changes that
were motivated by concerns about the level of debt, RR (2010) have automatically selected
changes that are correlated with variables in the intertemporal government budget constraint.
However, FG also show that in practice this does not seem to be an issue in this sample,
because controlling for debt does not change the impulse responses appreciably. Second,
and quite simply, the selection criterion of RR might prove less than air-tight. Policymakers
might declare that they are solely concerned about the de…cit or debt, while in reality they
are responding to a number of cyclical factors.
If dt=t is predetermined, one can …t a reaction function to it by estimating a VAR that
includes dt=t as an endogenous variable. The true model would then consists of (9), (10) and
dt=t = k1 yt

1

+ k2 dt

1=t 1

+ k20 (st

(19)

and the reduced form VAR is

(20)
(21)

Since by assumption dt=t does not respond to contemporaneous innovations in yt , impulse
responses are obtained from a Choleski decomposition in which dt=t is placed …rst. I call this
the "VAR speci…cation".
As Swanson (2006) points out, however, it is not clear how to interpret a shock to dt=t in
this speci…cation. This is the residual of a regression of the private sector’s estimate of an
innovation in discretionary taxation on lags of itself and other endogenous variables. It is

19

even more di¢ cult to interpret the impulse response to such a shock. Finally, it is inherently
di¢ cult to …t a reaction function to what one could interpret as a series of speci…c policy
episodes; indeed, one could argue that the whole purpose of the RR exercise is to capture
the policy shocks without having to …t a reaction function, as in BP (2002).
Note that in this speci…cation too estimates of the VAR coe¢ cients in general will be
inconsistent, unless one takes the moving average of

t

out of the error terms. Thus, once

again I will distinguish between OLS and IV estimates of the VAR speci…cation.

and where the second line of (22) represents the error term. Like FG (2010), I call (22) the
"augmented RR speci…cation". FG (2010) estimate by OLS the …rst line of (22); RR
(2010) do the same, but omit the lagged endogenous variable yt 2 ; I call (22) without the
term yt

2

the "RR speci…cation".

As FG (2010) note, omitting yt

2

can lead to inconsistent estimates if yt

is correlated

enters the expression

However, the inclusion of yt

t

does not solve all problems: like in the MR and FG speci-

2

and its lags in the error terms causes an additional bias, because

of the correlation between yt

2

and

t 2.

The solution here too is to take the terms

t i

out

of the error term, leading as usual to distinguishing between an OLS and an IV estimate of
the augmented RR speci…cation. In contrast, an IV estimate of the RR speci…cation is still
inconsistent, as the bias emanating from the exclusion of yt

which is the truncated MA representation that FG estimate by OLS. Now the terms in
dt

2=t 2

and

t 2

have disappeared into st 2 , hence there is no correlation between the error

term and the lagged endogenous variables yt

2

15

and st 2 .16

The presence of this correlation is a small sample result, but one that can potentially be important in
practice.
16
FG (2010) notice a large di¤erence in the OLS impulse responses of (24), depending on whether the
lagged endogenous variables yt 2 and st 2 are omitted or included. They attribute this di¤erence to dt=t
being predetermined, so that there is a correlation between dt=t and dt 1=t 1 on one hand and st 2 and yt 2
on the other. However, this is not necessarily so: in small samples, the inclusion of st 2 and yt 2 could have
e¤ects even if they were uncorrelated with dt=t and dt 1=t 1 .
An indication that this is indeed the case is the following. FG (2010) estimate a truncated MA representation using 12 lags of dt=t ; and lags 13 to 16 of st and yt ; and a second MA representation omitting lags
13 to 16 of the endogenous variables. They note that the two impulse responses start diverging precisely
after about 12 quarters. This is when the e¤ects of the lagged endogenous variables would start kicking in,
regardless of whether they are correlated with the shocks dt=t and its lags.

If j 1 j < j 1 j this coe¢ cient implies a smaller (in absolute value) impact multiplier than the
correct one. To this, one should add the bias caused by the same error in variable problem
that is present in the FG approach. However, the FG approach has a smaller forecast error
variance: if one knows the shocks of interest, there is no reason not to use them in estimation.

Speci…cations

In the empirical part, I estimate and compare the speci…cations described above, with more
realistic lag lengths and sets of endogenous variables.
1) The "RR speci…cation":
(30)

yt = A(L)dt=t + "t

where yt is the log di¤erence of real GDP per capita. As in RR, the order of the lagpolynomial A(L) is 13 (that is, A(L) includes powers 0 to 12 of the lag operator L).
2) The "augmented RR speci…cation":
Xt = A(L)dt=t + B(L)Xt

13

+ "t

(31)

where A(L) is of order 13 and B(L) of order 4. Besides yt; the vector Xt includes also the log
change of real primary government spending per capita gt , the …rst di¤erence of the in‡ation
rate

t,

and the …rst di¤erence of the interest rate

it .18 All the speci…cations that follow

will also be estimated in the two versions.
3) The "MR speci…cation":
Xt = A(L) dt=t + B(L) Xt
18

1

+ "t

(32)

These are the variables used by FG, except that they also include the log change of of real government
revenues.

23

where A(L) and B(L) are of order 5 and 4, respectively.
4) The "VAR speci…cation":
Xt = B(L) Xt

1

(33)

+ "t

where Xt now includes also dt=t and B(L) is of order 4.
5) The "FG speci…cation":
Xt =

dt=t + B(L) Xt

1

(34)

+ "t

with B(L) again is of order 4.
All speci…cations also include a constant. To maximize comparability with RR (2010), in
the baseline case I estimate all these speci…cations in …rst di¤erences. All these speci…cations
are estimated by both OLS and IV.
In the latter case, the set of regressors includes also the moving average (lags 0 to 4) of

I estimate all these speci…cations with three sets of data: the original RR dataset, and
the receipts and liabilities datasets described in section 2, using both the legislated changes
and the non legislated changes. In the benchmark case, I use the version of these data that
excludes the retroactive changes. In all cases I use only the exogenous changes as de…ned by

The sample of RR’s data on dt=t is 1947:1 - 2006:2; the sample of my data on dt=t is 1945:1
- 2009:4. The other constraints on the sample are the series on the log change in GDP,
government spending, and revenues per capita, that start on 1948:2 and end in 2009:4,20
while the series on the interest rate starts in 1947:1 and ends in 2007:1.21 With four lags of
the endogenous variables as instruments, the estimated series

t

from (9) starts in 1949:2;

and since at least four lags of the endogenous variables appear in each speci…cation, the
earliest starting date of an IV estimate is 1950:2.

I estimate this equation in two versions, an unrestricted one an a restricted one, in which
the coe¢ cient of dt=t is forced to be 1. The di¤erence between the two versions, and among
the di¤erent datasets, is minimal: the estimate of

ranges between 1.76 and 1.84. As a

comparison, the elasticity calculated by BP (2002) based on the elasticities provided by the
OECD has an average value between 1946:1 and 1997:4 of 2.06.

2 display impulse responses using RR data; columns 3 and 4, using my data on receipts;
columns 5 and 6, using my data on liabilities. In the latter two cases, the data include all
changes, i.e. LU, LA, and NLA in terms of Table 2.

double star "**".22 The change in taxes is scaled by GDP, so that the initial impulse is an
increase in discretionary taxes by 1 percentage point of GDP.
Row 1, columns 1 and 2 of Table 5 display the responses in the original RR speci…cation
with the original RR data. The response at 3 years is extremely large, a decline of almost 3
percent; it falls by 1 percentage point in absolute value as one moves rightward, from the
RR data to the receipts data (columns 3 and 4) and then to the liabilities data (columns 5
and 6), although it remains economically and statistically signi…cant.
The e¤ect at three years is consistently weaker in all other speci…cations. With my data,
either on receipts or liabilities, the e¤ect is about -1.5 in the augmented RR, MR and VAR
speci…cations (rows 2, 3 and 4), and signi…cant at the 5 percent level. In contrast, the FG
response (row 5) is very small, at about -.5 percentage points of GDP, and signi…cant only
at the 32 percent level.
Thus, as FG (2010) remark, a speci…cation that takes into account the correct truncation
of the MA representation, like theirs, would seem to lead to a much smaller tax multiplier
than estimated by RR (2010).
However, if

i

6=

0
i

an OLS estimation of the FG speci…cation su¤ers from attenuation

bias. In fact, consider now Table 6, which displays the IV estimates (because the IV estimate
of the RR speci…cation does not make sense, it is omitted in this table). The augmented RR,
22

Standard errors are computed on the basis of 1000 bootstrap replications.

27

MR and VAR responses are very close (and, with my receipts or liabilities data, virtually
identical) to the OLS estimates. As we have seen, a small di¤erence between the OLS and
IV responses of these speci…cations is consistent with

0
i

being small in absolute value. But

now the FG response increases substantially, and it is almost identical to the MR response.23
A large di¤erence between the OLS and IV responses of the FG speci…cation suggests that
i

6=

0
i

; because when

i

0
i

=

the OLS estimate of the FG response is consistent.

Thus, in all four IV speci…cations, with my data the range of the IV responses at three
years is again surprisingly tight, between -1.30 and -1.7, and substantially larger than the
OLS response estimated by FG (2010).

We have seen that, if

even OLS estimates of the FG speci…cation are consistent,

while OLS estimates of the other speci…cations remain inconsistent. In contrast, if

0
i

= 0;

OLS estimates of the MR, VAR, and augmented RR speci…cations are consistent, while
OLS estimate of the FG speci…cation are inconsistent. Tables 5 and 6 suggest that a
value of

0
i

= 0 is approximately correct, as moving from OLS to IV estimates makes little

di¤erence for the MR, VAR, and augmented RR speci…cations but a large di¤erence for the
FG speci…cation.
Two formal tests of the null

are available. First, in the MR speci…cation one can

and similarly for other speci…cations.

individually.
Second, from (13) or (22), one implication of the joint hypothesis that

23
As noted above, if one used the same instruments in equation (9), the MR and FG responses would be
identically equal. Because I use as instruments all the exogenous and lagged endogenous variables of the
model, in the MR speci…cation I use lags 0 to 4 of dt=t and lags 1 to 4 of yt ; gt ;

speci…cation I use only lag 0 of dt=t and I also use lags 1 to 4 of st :

is that impulse responses to dt=t and to

t

are the same. Figure 1 displays such responses

from the IV estimate of the MR speci…cation with liabilities data, with one standard error
bands (left panel) and two standard error bands (right panel). The solid lines display the
response to

t;

the broken line the response to dt=t : The former is essentially 0, while the

latter is negative and large, reaching a trough of -1.5 after about 2 years.24 At both levels of
signi…cance, after a few quarters the standard error bands of the two responses are entirely
apart. Thus, the evidence suggests that indeed the e¤ects of the discretionary component of
taxation are di¤erent from the e¤ects of at least one part of the endogenous component.

8

Anticipated vs. surprise changes to current taxation

From (8), dt=t can be written as the sum of surprise changes ut=t and anticipated changes
dt=t 1 : The speci…cations displayed in Tables 5 and 6 assume that surprise changes in taxation
have the same e¤ects as anticipated changes. For instance, in a world of hand-to-mouth
consumers as in Galí et al. (2007), ut=t and dt=t

1

should have the same e¤ects: future

changes are irrelevant to agents’behavior, they have an impact only when they occur.
One can test this hypothesis by IV estimation of the following version of the MR speci…cation25
Xt = B(L) Xt

1

+ C(L) ut=t + F (L) dt=t

(36)

+ "t

Figure 2 displays the two impulse responses, from IV estimates of (36) with liabilities data
(the responses at 6 and 12 quarters are also reported in rows 1 and 2, columns 1 and 2 of
Table 9). The solid lines display the response to dt=t

1

with its standard error bands, the

broken line the response and standard error bands to ut=t : The response to dt=t

1

is slightly

stronger and more signi…cant than the response to ut=t , but the di¤erence is not large.
24

This is the same response displayed in row 3, columns 5 and 6 of Table 6.
MR (2009) estimate by OLS the same speci…cation, and they also include the expectation of future
changes to discretionary taxation (see equation 39 below).

Anticipated vs. surprise changes to future taxation

9.1

Changes to future taxation

In their regressions, RR (2010) use the contemporaneous and lagged value of dt=t . But at
each date t we have more information than this. Consider the following decomposition (recall
that M is the maximum forecast horizon of a tax law):
Dt+M=t

Dt

= (Dt+M=t Dt+M

To better understand the rationale behind this equation, Table 7 lists the values of ut+i=t

j

included in each of the variables that appear in (39) and in their lags; it also lists the
coe¢ cients associated with each variable. For illustrative purposes, the table assumes K = 2;
M = 3; while C(L) and F (L) are of order 3. The surprise change to future discretionary
taxation ut+2=t is part of dt+2=t ; and so is the anticipated change to future discretionary
taxation ut+2=t 1 ; similarly, ut+1=t is part of dt+1=t ; and so are ut+1=t

1

and ut+1=t 2 : The

e¤ects over time of a unit realization of ut+2=t are then traced by the coe¢ cients G1 ; G0 ; F0 ;
F1 and F2 : The e¤ects of ut=t are instead captured by C0 ; C1 ; and C2 .
In practice, like MR (2009) I assume K = 6 and set both C(L) and F (L) of order 5.
Figure 3 and columns 3 and 4 of Table 9 display IV responses, with liabilities data, from
equation (39) to ut=t , dt=t 1 , and to dt+1=t up to dt+6=t . The responses to ut=t and dt=t

1

are

virtually the same as those from equation (36), in columns 1 and 2 and in Figure 2; like in

MR (2009), the responses to dt+i=t rise initially above 0; before declining to about -2.5, hence
below the long run response to dt=t estimated in Tables 5 and 6.
Hence, one interpretation of these results, as advocated for instance by MR (2009), is
that there is an initial positive response of output to a positive revision in expected future
taxes, followed by a large decline in output.

9.2

Separating surprise and anticipated changes to future taxation

One problem with this interpretation is that the variables dt+1=t to dt+6=t include surprise
and anticipated changes to future discretionary taxation. Just as dt=t can be decomposed
into ut=t and dt=t

1;

the same reasoning should be applied to changes to future taxation. In

fact
dt+i=t

Dt+i=t

The algebraic sum of the …rst and second term in (41) is ut+i=t ; the innovation in the expected
change in Dt+i ; or the surprise change in the slope of future taxation. The third term is
31

dt+i=t 1 ; the anticipated change in Dt+i , or the anticipated change in the slope of future
taxation.
Thus; I estimate the IV version of:

which derives from (39) after breaking down dt+i=t into ut+i=t and dt+i=t 1 : Like before, it
is useful to summarize the values of ut+i=t

j

included in each variable that appears in (42),

again assuming K = 2 for illustrative purposes. Table 8 makes the important point that now
each surprise change to future discretionary taxation appears by itself as a regressor, so that
its coe¢ cient is not contaminated by an anticipated component. Now a unit realization to
ut+2=t is captured by the coe¢ cient H2 ; then its e¤ects over time are traced by the coe¢ cients
L1 ; F0 ; F1 and F2 :

Figure 4 displays the various responses from equation (42); Table 9, columns 5 and 6
displays the responses at 6 and 12 quarters. The responses to ut=t and dt=t

1

are once again

similar to those from equations (36) and (39). Regarding the responses to future changes
in taxation, here too we observe the same pattern as in the contemporaneous changes: at
least at 3 years, the responses to the anticipated components dt+i=t
32

1

track quite closely the

responses to dt+i=t from equation (39). The responses to the surprise changes ut+i=t display
an erratic behavior; for instance, when i = 5 the response at 3 years is essentially -.9 and
insigni…cant, while when i = 6 it is about -5. In addition, the standard errors are large;
one reason is that, the higher i; the smaller the number of non-zero entries for ut+i=t : for
instance, there are only 5 non-zero values of ut+6=t :
Thus, the responses to changes in future expected taxation estimated from (39) seem to
be driven in large part by the anticipated component.

9.3

Changes in government spending

As several authors have pointed out, it is not obvious how to interpret responses to changes
in taxation. If the present discounted value of government spending changes together with
taxation, then the coe¢ cients Gi ’s, Hi ’s and Li ’s in equations (39) and (42) do not just
capture the intertemporal substitution e¤ect of tax changes. In fact, from the intertemporal government budget constraint, the shock to wealth caused by a change in the present
discounted value of government spending is given by a term that includes

Thus, the terms ut+i=t appear repeatedly in these formula; hence, in the regression they pick
up both substitution e¤ects and the e¤ects of the shock to wealth caused by the change in
government spending. The only way to try to resolve this question is precisely to control for
the change in the present value of government spending on goods and services.
Table 10, columns 1 and 2, displays responses to current anticipated and surprise shocks
to dt=t controlling for the present value of revisions to expectations of government spending
on goods and services; using the Survey of Professional Forecasters.26 Since the available
sample is much shorter (the survey starts in 1981:3), I display only estimates from the
baseline MR speci…cation and from equation (36). Columns (3) and (4) display the same
responses, but not controlling for the change in the present value of government spending,
on the same sample (hence, these responses are the same as those in rows 1 and 2, columns
1 and 2 of Table 9, but on a shorter sample). Note that in this shorter sample the response
at three years to both dt=t and to dt=t

1

is larger than before. But this is entirely caused by

the di¤erent sample: controlling for the revision in the present value of government spending
makes a minuscule di¤erence to the results.

Robustness

Table 11 displays the results of a few robustness checks. For brevity, the table reports only
the RR responses and the IV MR responses. In the …rst panel, the data are in levels, with
a linear and a quadratic trend. As expected, these responses display less persistence than
26

In each quarter t; this surveys presents forecasts up to 4 quarters ahead. I include forecasts both of
federal and of state and local spending.

that the RR responses are signi…cant, statistically and economically, only with the original
RR data.
The next panel displays responses using data that include also the retroactive changes.
In all three speci…cations the di¤erences with the baseline estimates are small.27
Finally, the last panel displays responses over the two subsamples, 1950:1 - 1979:4 and
1980:1 - 2007:1. Perotti (2002) showed that the spending and tax multipliers seem to have
decreased in the second subsamples in the US, UK, Canada and Australia. FG (2010)
also shows some evidence that this is the case for the tax multiplier in their speci…cation.
However, this holds only at 6 quarters; at 3 years, the responses in the two samples are very
similar, although in both the standard errors are larger than in the whole sample.
27

Note, however, that now the RR data display signi…cant negative serial correlation.

Conclusions

RR (2010)’s seminal contribution has been criticized because it implies implausibly large
negative e¤ects of exogenous changes in taxation on GDP - a decline by 3 percent in response
to a one percent of GDP increase in taxation. The contribution of this paper is twofold.
First, I introduce a novel dataset that expands on the RR dataset in several dimensions,
including a breakdown of aggregate taxation into its major components, and a distinction
between receipts and liabilities.
Second, I argue that on theoretical grounds the discretionary component of taxation
should be allowed to have di¤erent e¤ects on output than the endogenous component, namely
the automatic response of tax revenues to macroeconomic variables. Existing approaches to
study the e¤ects of the RR shocks do not allow for this di¤erence. In particular, FG (2010)
correctly argue that the speci…cation estimated by RR is not a truncated MA representation
of any process, and it is likely to be biased; the impulse response from the correct MA
representation delivers much smaller e¤ects on GDP, in some cases insigni…cantly di¤erent
37

from 0.
However, I show that when the discretionary and the automatic components of taxation
have di¤erent e¤ects on GDP, the FG impulse responses are biased towards 0. I derive a
VAR model that accommodates the di¤erent impacts of the discretionary and endogenous
components of taxation, and I then show that the impulse responses to a RR shock implied
by this speci…cation are about half-way between the large e¤ects of RR and the much smaller
e¤ects of FG: typically, a one percentage point of GDP increase in taxes leads to a decline
in output by about 1.5 percentage points after 12 quarters.
