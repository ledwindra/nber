PRICE BEHAVIOR IN JAPANESE AND U.S. MANUFACTURING

ABSTRACT
Relative price changes in Japanese and U.S. aanufacturing are driven by
two forces, productiviry growrh which leads to secular changes in coats and
exchange rate fluctuations which change relative prices between the two
countries.
In sectors where productivity growth is high, reductions in costs
can neutralize exchange rate appreciations to keep prices competitive with
those abroad, at least in the long run, But even in these sectors, exchange
rate fluctuations are the dominant influence on relative competitiveness in the
short run.
Faced with swings in exchange rates, firms adopt defensive measures to
defend their export markets. The paper presents estimates of 'pricing to
market" elasticities which suggest that firma lower their export prices in
domestic currency relative to their domestic prices in order to limit the
effects of currency appreciations.
There is evidence that firma in both
countries pursue such pricing strategies, but pricing to market is more
extensive in Japan.
In response to a appreciation of the yen, Japanese firma
reduce their export prices in yen sharply so as to limit the pass-through of
the appreciation into the dollar prices of their exports.

In

the past twenty

years,

the manufacturing sectors in Japan

and the United States have undergone major transformations.

Both

countries have experienced technological changes which have
shifted production from traditional sectors such as textiles and
steel to more sophisticated products. At the same time, the
relative position of the two countries has changed substantially
because Japan's aggregate productivity growth has exceeded U.S.
productivity growth by a large margin.

Japan has replaced the

United States as the leading exporter in one product after
another despite the fact that over the period as a whole the yen
has appreciated in value.

During this period of rapid change,

the two countries have been continually buffetted by exchange
rate fluctuations which have shifted one country's costs relative
to the other's.

Although these fluctuations are often soon

reversed, in the meantime they disrupt normal trading
relationships between two countries. Thus productivity growth
and exchange rate fluctuations have combined to produce major
changes in the relative competitiveness of the two countries'
manufacturing sectors. This study attempts to explain some of
these changes.
Most studies of international competitiveness in
manufacturing rely on aggregate price comparisons even though
there are many changes in relative prices at the sectoral level.1
Productivity growth varies widely across sectors of
manufacturing, with higher productivity growth holding down price
1

increases in some sectors relative to others.

In Japan's

electrical manufacturing sector, in fact, productivity growth is
so high that Japan's prices in that sector have remained

competitive despite the sizable real appreciation of the yen.
Many studies of competitiveness, moreover, examine broad trends
in relative prices over a decade or more without examining how

manufacturing firms cope with short run changes in exchange
rates.

Studies of purchasing power parity have suggested that

exchange rate changes induce large changes in relative prices in
the short run.2

But only recently have economists examined how

firms set prices in the short run in response to changes in
exchange rates.

Such studies emphasize pass—through and pricing

to market behavior in attempting to understand why price changes
occur at different rates depending upon the manufacturing
sector.

This paper uses sectoral data for Japanese and U.S.
manufacturing to study secular trends in relative prices between
the two countries.

Because productivity growth varies widely

across manufacturing sectors as well as between countries, the
prices of U.S. relative to Japanese goods change at widely
different rates depending upon the sector of manufacturing. The
first section of the paper examines these secular changes in
prices.

Then the paper turns to short term changes in relative

prices induced by fluctuations in exchange rates.

Two types of

price changes are distinquished depending upon how sustained are
the exchange rate fluctuations.

The last section of the paper
2

then examines how manufacturing firms cope with exchange rate
fluctuations. Using sectoral data for export and domestic
prices,

the paper examines pass—through and pricing to market

behavior.

In each country, a period of currency appreciation is

studied to determine whether firms in that country follow pricing
practices designed to neutralize the effects of appreciation on
their relative competitiveness.
I. Principal Determinants of Relative Competitiveness

The relative competitiveness of manufacturing in Japan and
the United States depends primarily on two factors, secular
trends in productivity and changes in relative prices driven by
variations in exchange rates.

Over periods of a decade or more,

trends in productivity can lead to relatively large changes in
relative prices within the manufacturing sector as well as
between countries.

But in the shorter run, changes in exchange

rates exert a dominating influence on relative prices between
countries.

This is true whether relative prices are measured

month—to-month or over periods as long as three to five years.
This section of the paper will compare secular trends with these
shorter term movements in relative prices.
A. Secular Trends in Competitiveness

In the past two decades there has been a major shift in
production within manufacturing in both countries.

These shifts

have been accompanied by surprisingly large changes in relative
prices,

both across industries within each country and between

countries in the same industry.

Just how large these shifts in

production have been can be indicated by a few examples.

In

1970, 29.6 percent of Japanese manufacturing output (GDP in

manufacturing) was in the machinery and equipment sectors (which
includes electrical machinery and transport equipment).4
that share had risen to 51.5 percent.

By 1986

In the United States,

machinery and equipment already constituted 40.2 percent of
output in 1970.

But by 1986, that share had grown to 50.2

percent of output.

During this same period, Japanese textile

production fell from 5.3 percent of inanufactu-ing output to 2.6
percent.

In the United States, textile production fell less than

in Japan,

but basic metal production fell from 10.1 percent to

4.7 percent.

These shifts of production were accompanied by large changes
in relative prices.

In the period from 1975 to 1987,

Japanese

producer prices in manufacturing rose by 18.2 percent.5

But

within manufacturing, the price changes varied widely from sector
to sector.

In the metal products sector,

prices rose by 22.8

percent, but in the electrical machinery sector, prices
15.1 percent.
also large,

ll

by

In the United States, the range of variation was

though less dramatic.

In the U.S. chemical industry,

for example, prices rose by 13.8 percent less than in

manufacturing as a whole (48.7 percent vs. 62.5 percent).
When relative prices change substantially, measures of
competitiveness based on aggregate price indexes can be very
misleading.

In some industries,

a country may experience major
4

changes in the prices of its goods relative to those of other
countries even though aggregate real exchange rates between the
two countries are stable.

The country might gain competitiveness

in some industries while losing competitiveness in others.

In the long run at least, changes in relative prices occur
primarily because of changes in the cost of producing goods.
Although wages can grow at different rates across industries and
some industries can experience greater increases in materials
costs than others, the primary reason why costs grow at different
rates acros3 industries is that productivity gains vary widely
across those industries.
In industries producing electrical
machinery, for example, productivity growth might be two or three
times as fast as in manufacturing as a whole.

As a result the

inflation rate for the electrical machinery sector is much lower
than in manufacturing as a whole or in most other sectors.
If a country experiences large internal relative price

changes, it might be able to remain competitive in particular
industries even if its currency appreciates in real terms (as
measured by broad—based price indexes).

In that case the change

in competitiveness would be apparent only if real exchange rates
were defined for individual industries.

a rise in this real exchange rate represents a real

appreciation of the dollar and a loss of competitiveness for the
United States in that sector or industry.
Figure 1 reports percentage changes in sectoral real
exchanges between the United States and Japan over the period
1975 to 1987.6

At the center of the figure is the percentage

change for manufacturing as a whole; over this twelve year period
the dollar depreciated a total of — 27.7 percent (most of the
depreciation occurring at the end of the period).

This

depreciation, however, was exceeded in four of the industries
illustrated, with the largest depreciations over 40 percent in
metal products and textiles.

At the other extreme, the United

States lost competitiveness in one sector, electrical machinery;

by

4.9 percent relative to

The real exchange rate rose for electrical

machinery primarily because of high productivity growth in
Japan's electrical machinery sector.

Japanese firms in that

sector were able to lower costs sufficiently to keep prices
competitive despite the real appreciation in manufacturing as a
whole.

In the motor vehicle sector,

U.S. prices fell relative to

those in Japan, but only by 4.8 percent.

As in the electrical

machinery sector, the differential growth in productivity kept
Japanese prices from rising much in dollar terms.

In two other

sectors, general machinery and non-ferrous metals, the real

appreciation of the yen was also smaller than in manufacturing as
a whole.7

Thus trends in productivity introduced considerable

variation in real exchange rates across sectors.

B. Effects of Exchange Rate Variability

The overall trend in real exchange rates for manufacturing
as a whole is governed by macroeconomic factors.

Productivity

performance in a particular sector can mitigate the effects of
this overall trend in real exchange rates, but cannot insulate
that sector from exchange rate developments. The relative
competitiveness of countries is even more sensitive to exchange
rate movements in the short run than in the long run.
Two types of exchange rate movements can be distinguished in
the data.
volatility.

The first type is day-to-day or month—to-month
Because exchange rates are determined primarily by

financial transactions, they exhibit the same variability that is
characteristic of prices in financial markets.

The second type

of exchange rate movement is longer in duration, typically

lasting from three to five years.

These medium term swings in

nominal exchange rates, referred to as misalignments, can lead to
changes in real exchange rates by over forty percent, as they did
in the case of

the pound sterling

in the early 1980s and in the

case of the dollar in the mid—1980s.

Each type of exchange rate

variability is considered in turn.
Volatility:

The volatility of exchange rates has been assessed in
7

previous studies by comparing the variances of exchange rates
with the variances of goods prices, on the one hand, and
financial asset prices, on the other hand.

In Narston (1988),

for example, the variances of exchange rates for the major

industrial countries are shown to be far greater than the
variances of goods prices as measured by the wholesale price
index and are comparable in magnitude to the variances of asset
prices.

But such a comparison fails to show clearly enough the

extent to which the volatility of exchange rates breaks the link
between the prices of identical or similar goods originating in
different countries. If exchange rates were stable, the prices
of similar goods from different countries would be closely

related when expressed in a common currency unless international
trade barriers inhibited international competition.

But under

flexible exchange rates, highly volatile exchange rates are used
to convert goods prices into foreign currencies, so the prices of
these goods may fluctuate substantially relative to the prices of
goods originating in foreign countries.
This study uses prices disaggregated to the sectoral level
in manufacturing to examine the following question:

Has

randomness of flexible exchange rates so reduced the integration
of different national markets in any one sector of manufacturing

That is, the random movement in nominal

exchange rates would have made the prices of American "apples"
more closely linked to those of American "oranges" than to those
of Japanese "apples".

To compare internal with external price adjustment, month—
to—month variations in producer price indexes are examined over
the 1975—87 period.

of

In

eight of the sectors, the correlations across countries range
from —0.12 in textiles, clothing and leather to 0.06 in
industrial chemicals.

In only one sector is the correlation

between Japanese and U.S. prices higher than between that
sector's prices and prices in manufacturing as a whole.

In the

non—ferrous metals sector, the external price correlation is
surprisingly high at 0.55.

Unlike other products, the prices for

non-ferrous metals seem to be determined in internationally
integrated markets.

All other external price correlations are

statistically insignificant at the five percent level.
The general conclusion must be that exchange rate volatility
imparts so much variability to the prices of these countries'
10

goods in foreign currency that it disupts the links between the
prices of similar goods across countries. Yet if it were the
case that changes in relative prices across countries had no
discernible trends, manufacturing firms could learn to cope with
this type of variability, just as they cope with other forms of
uncertainty.

On the other hand, if exchange rate movements

persist in one direction or another over the medium term,
adjustment by firms is much more difficult. That is the case
with misalignments of exchange rates.
Misalignment
The term misalignment refers to medium term swings in real
exchange rates away from long—run equilibrium.

Thus

misalignments involve real rather than nominal exchange rates,
and medium term rather than short term changes in exchange rates.
Not all swings in real exchange rates are necessarily
misalignments, since real disturbances such as supply shocks can
lead to changes in equilibrium real exchange rates.

For example,

the appreciation of sterling in the late 1970s has been
attributed,

at least in part, to the discovery of oil and gas in

the North Sea.

But

the swings

in the dollar relative to the yen

(as well as other currencies) have been so large that it is

difficult not to regard them as misalignments, especially in the
absence of any real disturbances affecting the dollar comparable
to the North Sea discovery.8

The swings in real exchange rates from one extreme
another are at least as large as the long run

trends

to

discussed.

Table

2

measures the swings in the dollar relative to

the yen from the trough of the dollar in 1978 to its peak in 1984
and then to the end of the period in 1987.

The figures are based

on average exchange rates and prices in these three years.

According to the table, the real exchange rate of the dollar rose
by 35.7 percent from 1978 to 1984 in manufacturing as a whole.
Then the dollar fell sharply by 41.7 percent in the following
three years ending in 1987.

Similar swings were experienced in

each of the sectors of manufacturing, although in the non-ferrous
metals sector, the swing was only half as large.

In the last two

sectors, electrical machinery and motor vehicles, the underlying
trends in real exchange rates led to a larger real appreciation
of the dollar in the earlier period than in manufacturing as a
whole and a smaller real depreciation in the later period.
The large swings experienced across manufacturing can hardly
be attributed solely to changes in long run equilibrium exchange
rates.

Instead, these swings must have involved substantial

misalignments of exchange rates.

And even to the extent that

equilibrium rates changed, manufacturing firms still had to cope
with changing relative prices requiring many forms of adjustment.
Defensive Actions by Firms

A firm may have difficulty coping with

inisalignments because

it knows neither the size nor the duration of any swing in real

exchange rates.

The firm's exports rise and fall with real

depreciations and appreciations. And so also do the firm's
employment and production at home.

In response to a real
12

appreciation, the firm may elect to transfer production abroad.
But since the duration of the real appreciation is usually
unknown, the firm may find that its transfer of production
abroad is accomplished only after the home currency begins
depreciating back to normal levels.
An alternative strategy is to follow pricing policies
designed to keep the firm competitive in foreign markets despite
an appreciation of the home currency.

to both export and domestic markets.
"Pricing to market", in contrast,

is an active policy

designed to defend the export market of the firm.

Pricing to

market occurs when the firm lowers the price of its exports in
domestic currency relative to the price of goods for the domestic
market.9

The next section studies both of these pricing

phenomena.
II. Pass-through and Pricing to Market

With the competitive position of exporting firms shifting so
sharply in response to changes in exchange rates, it is not
13

surprising that these firms take defensive

-actions.

As suggested

one of the primary ways firms defend their market position

is by limiting the pass-through of exchange rates into the

foreign currency prices of their exports.

But by limiting pass-

through, these firms may open a gap between the prices of
products sold domestically and the prices of their exports
expressed in domestic currency.
A. Different Types of Pricing Behavior by Firms

To be more precise about the behavior involved,

it is

necessary to distinquish between three prices (for the case of
the Japanese good):

This behavior can be

rationalized by appealing to simple profit maximization.

The

appreciation of the domestic currency raises the marginal costs
of the export (calculated

in foreign currency)

proportionally. If

the markup of price over marginal cost were constant, the price
of the export in foreign currency would also have to rise
proportionally to the exchange rate.
demand conditions, however,

a

Under a wide range of

rise in the price of a good leads

to a fall in the markup of price over marginal cost.

So the

price in foreign currency increases less than the rise in the
marginal cost, and the pass—through is therefore only partial.
With partial pass-through into the export price in foreign
currency, the price of the export in domestic currency must fall
relative to the price of the same good sold in the domestic
market.

So "pricing to market" occurs.

Other rationales have been offered for limited pass-through
and pricing to market.

Krugman (1987) shows that in a model of

Cournot oligopoly, the price of the export in foreign currency
rises less than proportionally to the appreciation even when the
demand curve has a constant elasticity.

(If the demand curve has

a constant elasticity, the markup is constant when there is a

monopoly rather than oligopoly in the industry).

Froot and

Klemperer (1988) specify a dynamic model where the future demand
for a product depends on current market share.

In that model,

a

firm facing an appreciation which it perceives to be temporary
may limit increases in the prices of its exports in order to
maintain market share for the future.

So there are several

reasons why firms might modify the degree of currency pass—
15

through by pricing to market.
The degree of pass—through can be measured by the passthrough elasticity,

appreciation beginning in the first quarter of 1985.

Suppose

that it is found that the appreciation led to increases in the
prices of Japanese exports, measured in dollars, which were
smaller than the change in exchange rates (measured as an
absolute value).

The pass-through may be incomplete because

Japanese firms are pricing to market, lowering their export
prices in yen relative to their domestic prices.

But

alternatively, the pass-through may be incomplete for reasons
having nothing to do with defensive actions taken by Japanese
manufacturing firms.

It may be the case that Japanese costs of

production fell because the prices of imported materials fell
when the yen appreciated.-0

(The price index for imported

commodities measured in yen fell in half between February 1985
16

and December 1988).

Or it may be the case that costs fell for

reasons totally unrelated to the appreciation.

In order to

identify pass—through effects, it would be necessary to measure
these cost factors for each of the sectors of nanufacturing
studied.

Instead, this paper looks at pricing to market behavior

where changes in costs are unlikely to be so important.
To determine how firms react to exchange rate changes, it

is

more useful to examine directly how firms change export prices
relative to the domestic prices of the same product.

Most

countries do not report separate price indexes for domestic goods
and exports, but Japan and the United States have developed
export price indexes to match their producer price indexes for
many of their important exports. This makes it possible to
calculate pricing to market elasticities measuring directly
pricing behavior of these countries' firms.
The pricing to market elasticity involves the relative price
of exports to domestic goods,

This elasticity measures the percentage change in this relative

rate,

The real exchange rate rather than the nominal exchange rate is
used because nominal changes matched by offsetting changes in
17

general price levels are unlikely to induce pricing to market
behavior.

If firms vary the relative price of exports to

domestic goods, then the pricing to market elasticity will lie
between zero and one.

If firms do not price to market, then of

course the coefficient is equal to zero.

The advantage

of looking at the ratio of export to domestic

prices rather than export prices alone is that changes in
marginal costs are likely to have less influence on the former.
That is, even though changes in marginal costs normally affect
export prices and domestic prices individually, they need not
affect the ratio of the two prices.

As Marston (1989) shows,

changes in marginal costs leave this ratio unaffected as long as
the markups of prices over marginal costs in the export and
domestic markets are equally sensitive to price changes.11

In

such cases, changes in the ratio of export to domestic prices can
be attributed to exchange rate changes alone,

Even if markups

respond differently in the two markets, the price ratio changes
only in proportion to the difference in the elasticities of the
markups with respect to prices.

So cost factors are not a major

influence on the price ratio except to the extent that markup
elasticities differ substantially in the export and domestic
markets.
To illustrate the difference between pass-through effects
and pricing to market effects, consider Table

for two cases.

The first

case is one in which the markup of prices over marginal costs is
18

constant so there is no pricing to market behavior.

The pass—

through of the appreciation of the yen into the dollar price of
the export is only partial because marginal costs have fallen as
demand for the export falls, thus permitting the yen price of the
export to fall.

Since there is no pricing to market behavior,

the yen price of the export remains equal to the yen price
charged in the domestic market.
The second case is one in which pricing to market breaks the
link between the export price and domestic price.

In response to

the appreciation, exporting firns reduce the yen price of their
exports relative to the domestic price of that same good.

So

there is again partial pass-through into the dollar price of the
export, but this time the partial pass—through is due to changes
in markups rather than just changes in marginal costs.

It is

this second case which is of particular interest.
B. Evidence on Pass-Through and Pricing to Market Behavior

In this section, Japanese and U.S. pricing behavior is
studied in detail.

For each country, pricing to market

elasticities are calculated by comparing changes in the ratio of
export to domestic prices with changes in exchange rates.

For

Japan, pass—through elasticities are also calculated in order to
illustrate the difference between pass-through and pricing to
market.

For each country,

a period of currency appreciation is

studied because pricing to market behavior is more likely to be
found when firms are losing competitiveness in export markets.

19

Japanese Pricing Behavior

For Japan, the period of appreciation begins at the peak
the dollar's rise in February 1985

and ends

of

in December 1988.

This period is long enough so that any observed changes in export
prices measured in yen can be attributed to pricing decisions by
Japanese firms rather than to the translation into yen of export
prices set in dollars.

(If export prices are set in dollars,

then unanticipated changes in exchange rates can lead to
variations in export prices translated into yen.

But since

export prices are unlikely to be set more than a few months
ahead,

observed changes in prices over the period studied must

reflect equilibrium pricing decisions rather than translation
effects).

The Bank of Japan provides export and domestic prices for
number of sectors of manufacturing with significant exports.

a

The

export prices are FOB prices for exports expressed in yen, while
the domestic prices are those reported at the primary wholesale
level for sale in Japan.

Nine sectors are studied in this paper

ranging from textiles to precision instruments. The sectors are
listed in Table 4.
Although the United States accounts for a large share of
Japanese exports in these sectors, the products are exported to a
number of different countries. So the nominal and real exchange
rates appearing in expressions

and

above should be

effective exchange rates defined over prices and exchange rates
for a number of countries which import Japanese products.

The
20

United Nations reports export shares by product in its Comnodity
Trade Statistics. Export shares for 1986 are used to form
weights for sector-specific series for the nominal and real
exchange rates.

For example, there are nominal and real

effective exchange rates for the textile sector based on export
shares for textiles.
To form the nominal exchange rate series for each sector,
the export shares for that sector are used to weight the
corresponding bilateral exchange rates forming a nominal
effective exchange rate for that sector (Sit).

To form the real

exchange rate for each sector (Rit), wholesale prices are first
converted into dollars using monthly average exchange rates.
When wholesale prices are not available, consumer prices are used
instead.

The series for prices and bilateral exchange rates are

drawn from the International Monetary Fund, International
Financial Statistics.12 The real effective exchange rate is
defined as the weighted average of foreign prices converted from
dollars into yen and deflated by the Japanese wholesale price
index.

Twenty-three countries in all are represented in the

exchange rate series.

percent, while in the non-ferrous metals sector

it is 83 percent.

The interpretation of the pass-through elasticities is
straightforward. In the case of textiles, for example, the
elasticity of -0.57 means that a 10 percent appreciation of the
yen leads to a rise in the export price in foreign currency by
5.7 percent.

Since the nominal appreciation was 60.0 percent,

the export price rose by 34.2 percent in foreign currency (a
partial pass-through made possible by a decline in the export
price in yen by 25.8 percent). As noted above, the low degree of
pass—through in this and other sectors may reflect a reduction in
markups by exporters, but it may also reflect reductions in costs
which lower prices in the domestic as well as export markets.
22

The bottom half of the table reports pricing to market
effects.

In

this case,

price changes are compared with changes

in real rather than nominal exchange rates.

The first column of

the table reports percentage changes in the ratio of export to

domestic prices.

Since both of these prices are expressed in

yen, any change in the ratio is evidence of pricing to market.

The changes range from only 4.0 percent in non-ferrous metals to
34.9 percent in chemicals.

To evaluate the size of these

changes, it is necessary to form

a pricing

to market elasticity

obtained by dividing the relative price change by the change in
the real effective exchange rate.

Changes in real effective

exchange rates range from 31.7 percent in the precision
instruments sector to 42.6 percent in the non-ferrous metals
sector.

0.09

The pricing to market elasticities, in turn, range from

in non—ferrous metals to 1.09 in the chemicals sector.

Consider the case of textiles again.

An elasticity of 0.40

means that a 10 percent real appreciation of the yen is followed
by a 4 percent fall in the ratio of export to domestic prices.

In response to a real appreciation for that sector of 37.5
percent the ratio of export to domestic prices falls by 14.9
percent.14

The fall in this ratio dampens substantially the

increase in the foreign currency price of the exports.
In general, pricing to market plays a major role in Japanese
manufacturing.

In the three export sectors representing 70

percent of exports, general machinery, electrical machinery, and
transport equipment, the pricing to market elasticities range
23

from 0.41 to 0.63.

So roughly one—half of the yen's real

appreciation has been neutralized by changing export prices
relative to domestic prices.

pricing to market elasticity is a little over 1.0.

chemicals, the
In only one

sector, non-ferrous metals, is the elasticity negligible in size.
American Pricing Behavior
To examine pass-through and pricing to market in U.S.

manufacturing, producer price indexes and export price indexes
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics were used.

These data are

disaggregated by sectors like the Japanese data, but not all of
the sectors have export prices,

Neither textiles nor metal

products have export prices for the period studied, and in place
of separate series for iron and steel and for non—ferrous metals,

there is a single series for primary metals.

Nonetheless, the

most important sectors have export prices available, including
chemicals, general machinery, electrical machinery, transport
equipment, and precision instruments)-5 As in the case of Japan,
series for effective exchange rates were developed based on U.S.
export flows.
Because pricing to market behavior is more likely to emerge
in a period when a currency appreciates rather than depreciates,
U.S. behavior was examined over the three—year period prior to
rather than following the dollar's peak in February 1985.

Some

export price series are available for shorter periods only, so
the sample period December 1981 to December 1984 applies to only
four out of the six sectors studied)-6
24

Table 5 reports pricing to market elasticities for six
manufacturing sectors.

The elasticities are quite low with the

exception of the one for primary metals.

In the chemical sector,

for example, the elasticity is 0.26, indicating that an 11.3
percent real appreciation of the dollar leads to a fall in the
ratio of export to domestic prices by 3.0 percent.

In four other

sectors the pricing to market elasticities are even lower.
Two sectors have unusual price patterns.

The high

elasticity in the primary metals sector is probably attributable
to the tact that this sector combines iron and steel and nonferrous metals, the latter having a highly volatile price.

The

negative pricing to market elasticity in the transport equipment
sector is a reflection of the unusual pattern of auto trade
between Canada and the United States.

Notice that the 6.3

percent appreciation of the dollar is much smaller than in other
sectors because of the relative stability of the Canadian
dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate.

The movement of the

export/domestic price ratio in this sector is more a reflection
of the particular auto models shipped between the United States

and Canada than more general pricing behavior.
If these two sectors are ignored,

pricing to market behavior

appears to be less pronounced than in the case of Japan.

In

Japan, pricing to market coefficients are generally around 0.50,
while in the United States, the coefficients are between 0.07 and
0.26.
To investigate U.S. pricing behavior further, more
25

disaggregated (four-digit)

data were obtained for three sectors

trade occurs: general machinery, electrical

machinery, and precision instruments.

In these three sectors,

there are ten fourdigit products with both export and domestic
PPI data available beginning in December 1982 or earlier,

These

ten products are listed in Table 6 together with the sample
period for each product.

(No disaggregated data were available

for chemicals or primary metals over this period).

The table

presents the percentage change in the ratio of export to domestic
prices, the percentage change in the real effective exchange
rate, and the pricing to market elasticity.

For each product,

the real effective exchange rate is defined for the corresponding
two—digit sector.
The table shows that seven of the ten products have pricing
to market elasticities smaller than 0.30, three of which are even
negative (though close to zero).

Those products exhibit little

if any pricing to market behavior.

product

For example,

in the case of

3533, oilfield and gasfield machinery and equipment, the

pricing to market elasticity is only 0.14; a real appreciation of
the dollar by 18.8 percent leads to a fall in the ratio of export
to domestic prices of only 2.7 percent.

Three other products

have larger elasticities, but only one product, miscellaneous
electronic components, has an elasticity greater than 0.40
percent.

So this table based on disaggregated data confirms the

earlier evidence that U.S. firms appear to price to market less
than Japanese firms.

Or

it may be because American firms have

diversified their production facilities enough so that pricing to
market is less necessary to preserve export markets.

Many large

American firms have production facilities in a variety of
countries from which they can export,

so an appreciation of the

dollar may lead to a shift in export production from the United
States to a plant or plants abroad.

If this is the case, then

the recent diversification of production facilities by Japanese
firms may lead to less pricing to market there in the future.
III. Conclusion

This paper has provided a variety of evidence on pricing
behavior in Japanese and U.S. manufacturing.

Relative price

movements are dominated by real factors such as productivity
growth in the longer run, but in the short run

changes

in

exchange rates can disrupt normal relationships between

prices.

Since 1975, the yen has appreciated relative to the dollar

when measured

in real terms using prices in the manufacturing

sector as a whole.

But the aggregate figures hide considerable

variation in the relative performance of individual sectors of
manufacturing.

Japan has had such high productivity growth in
27

one sector, electrical manufacturing, that the real appreciation
has been reversed by the relative decline of Japanese prices in
that sector.
These secular trends in relative competitiveness, however,
are overshadowed by fluctuations in exchange rates in the short
run.

The paper has shown that the month-to-month volatility of

exchange rates makes prices in the same sector less correlated
across countries than prices in different sectors within either
economy.

Even medium term movements in exchange rates have major

effects on prices,

since misalignnents aru large enough to offset

any secular movements in relative prices.
Faced with swings in real exchange rates, firms adopt
defensive measures to defend their export markets.

The paper

presents estimates of pricing to market elasticities which
suggest that firms lower their export prices relative to their
domestic prices in order to limit the effects of currency
appreciations. There is evidence that firms in both countries
pursue such pricing to market, but Japanese firms appear to
change their export prices more than American firms.

7. The 27.7 percent real depreciation for manufacturing as a
whole overstates the actual gain in competitiveness for the
United States, since Japanese exports are concentrated in sectors
like electrical machinery and motor vehicles where Japan has
remained competitive despite the nominal appreciation of the yen.

see Williamson (1985).

Consider the following equation relating (percentage changes

the price of the export in yen to the markup of price over
marginal cost, Mxjt, and to marginal cost, Cit:
in)

xit/5'xit

xit/Mxit + dCit/Cit.

In response to the appreciation of the yen, the price of

exports
38

(in yen> could fall because markups are reduced, as a result of
pricing to market, or because marginal costs fall.
11.
If export and domestic prices are tied to the same marginal
cost, but are influenced by different markup factors (Mxit and
can be related to these
Mdit, respectively), then changes in
markup factors as follows:

X

dXit/Xjt

xit/Mxit

-

dit/Mdit.
X,

In order for marginal cost to affect
it must have a greater
impact on one markup than on the other. If the elasticities of
these markups with respect to prices are equal, then Xj is
unaffected by changes in marginal cost.
12. In the case of Hongkong, export prices from WEFA's INLINE
data base are used in place of wholesale prices.
In the case of
Taiwan, the prices and exchange rates are drawn from its

publication, Financial Statistics.

13. Since export prices are reported in yen rather than foreign
currency, the table presents the percentage change in the yen
price. As equation (2) indicates, the pass—through elasticity
can be obtained by subtracting one from the ratio of the change
in the export price in yen to the change in the nominal exchange
rate.

The table indicates that the export price for textiles
expressed in yen falls by 25.8 %. To determine how much the
domestic price changes, simply subtract the percentage change in
the export/domestic price ratio from the percentage change in the
export price, since all variables are expressed in logs. Thus
for textiles, the percentage change in the domestic price is
—25.8% — (—14.9%) = —10.9%.
14.

There is no producer price index for precision instruments,
so the domestic inflation rate for electrical machinery had to be
used in its place.
15.

Export prices are available for the third month of each
quarter only, so it was not possible to end the sample period in
February 1985, the month that the dollar peaked in value.
