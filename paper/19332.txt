To Give or Not to Give: The Price of Contributing and the Provision of Public Goods
Johannes Diederich and Timo Goeschl
NBER Working Paper No. 19332
August 2013
JEL No. C93,D12,H41
ABSTRACT
We examine the relationship between the price of giving and the decision to contribute in a framed
field experiment (n = 2,440). In a departure from previous research using match rates and rebates,
we vary the price of contributing to the public good directly. Treatment groups differ between subjects
by the amount of money subjects have to give up in order to provide one unit of the public good. In
contrast to earlier results, the theoretical prediction of a clear negative relationship between price and
the decision whether to contribute is borne out by the experimental evidence. We estimate the mean
elasticity of the probability to contribute as -0.31. The direct price effect is robust across specifications
including sociodemographic controls for the highly heterogenous, Internet-representative non-student
sample of subjects.

Introduction

The private provision of public goods has been attracting sustained attention from economists
for several decades now. A natural and recurrent question within this field has been how the
price of giving to the public good aﬀects its supply (see e.g. Vesterlund 2006). Answering this
question requires observing variations in the price of giving, and relating those price variations
to observed variations in giving decisions. The empirical literature, starting with Feldstein and
Taylor (1976) and Feldstein and Clotfelter (1976), has been exploiting observable variations in
the marginal income tax rate between households to study the price eﬀect in settings in which
contributions to public or charitable causes are tax deductible and, therefore, subsidized.1 More
recently, the focus of empirical research in this area has shifted to gathering evidence from field
experiments carried out in a fundraising context. These have provided new estimates of price
elasticities of giving (Karlan and List 2007, Eckel and Grossman 2008, Karlan et al. 2011, Huck
and Rasul 2011). A major benefit of field experiments is that the researcher is not restricted
by given variations in marginal income tax rates. Instead, exogenous variations in the price of
giving can be introduced in a controlled manner and independent of subjects’ household income.
The typical vehicle for such exogenous variations have been changes in the so-called “match
ratio”, i.e. the amount of money that some third party will contribute for every unit of money
donated by the subject (Karlan and List 2007, Eckel and Grossman 2008, Karlan et al. 2011,
Huck and Rasul 2011).2 Converted into theoretically equivalent price variations, the evidence
from variations in match ratios forms the basis of our current empirical understanding of the
price eﬀect.
Using variations in match ratios as a measure of the price eﬀect in giving decisions oﬀers a
number of advantages, as it allows randomized assignment to subjects, is a familiar feature of
fundraising, and is easy to implement.3 It is also theoretically straightforward: The conversion
of match ratios into theoretically equivalent price changes is simple. A 1:1 (1:2) match ratio
should have the same eﬀect as a reduction in the price by 50% (67%).
1 See, e.g., Peloza and Steel (2005) for a comprehensive review of empirical estimates of the price elasticity of
giving.
2 For comparative purposes, Eckel and Grossman (2008) also uses rebate rates as a vehicle.
3 Even though one drawback is that matches and rebates only allow the experimenter to reduce the price of
giving, not to increase it.

2

At the same time, getting at the price eﬀect indirectly via match ratios also has drawbacks.
One important drawback is the assumption implicit in the indirect approach that subjects’
response to variations in match ratios can safely be interpreted as those of the theoretically
equivalent price variation. The validity of this assumption has been thrown into doubt by recent
experimental evidence. For example in the case of contributions to public goods, match ratios
and their theoretically equivalent rebate rates give rise to systematically diﬀerent behavior among
potential contributors, both in the laboratory (Eckel and Grossman 2003) and in the field (Eckel
and Grossman 2008). The introduction of a match leads to a greater eﬀect on giving than the
introduction of its theoretically equivalent rebate rate. Similarly, in an experiment involving
private goods, Davis and Millner (2005) compare rebates, matches, and direct price variations
that should be equivalent on theoretical grounds. They find that there are systematic diﬀerences
in the quantity responses to these vehicles. This implies that for private goods, “match rate
elasticities”, i.e. price elasticities derived on the basis of variations in match ratios, are likely
to be biased estimators of the price elasticity in a narrow sense. While we are not aware of
comparable evidence for public goods, these results show at a minimum that the empirical
equivalence of variations in match rates and in prices cannot be taken for granted.
In this paper, we present the design and report on the results of a framed field experiment
that provides a direct measure of the price eﬀect in a decision whether to contribute or not. The
direct price eﬀect arises out of the treatment condition in the experiment: Diﬀerent subjects are
randomly assigned a diﬀerent amount of money that they give up if they decide to supply one
unit of the public good. The observed eﬀect on the probability to contribute therefore closely
relates to the notion of the price eﬀect from the theory of the private provision of public goods
(Bergstrom et al. 1986, Andreoni 1990). The decision whether to contribute or not presents
a useful first target for a study of the direct price eﬀect: While an immediate prediction of
theory is that, all else equal, the share of contributors in a population is a decreasing function
of the price of contributing, a number of papers have found little field experimental support for
the conjecture. Neither variations in match rates (Karlan and List 2007, Eckel and Grossman
2008, Huck and Rasul 2011) nor in rebate rates (Eckel and Grossman 2008) appear to influence
subjects’ decision whether to contribute.4 Similarly, in an empirical paper exploiting variation in
4 However,

there is evidence that the presence of a lead donor in itself has a significant positive impact on the

3

marginal tax rates, Smith et al. (1995) find that the rebate rate does not impact on the decision
whether to contribute to a rural health care facility.
The basic idea of simply using direct price variation as a treatment in an experiment on giving
is, of course, not new. For example, Andreoni and Miller (2002) and Andreoni and Vesterlund
(2001) introduce, in a laboratory-based within-subject dictator game design, a direct variation in
the price of giving by changing how many units of their experimental endowment a dictator has
to give up in order to transfer a unit to the recipient. However, the idea has to our knowledge not
been used in the context of public goods provision and in a framed field experiment (Harrison and
List 2004). The latter enables us to control for a number of subject attributes such as age (e.g.
List 2004), gender (e.g. Andreoni and Vesterlund 2001), education (e.g. Karlan 2005) and culture
(Ockenfels and Weimann 1999, Brandts et al. 2004, Brosig-Koch et al. 2011) that conceivably
interact with the price eﬀect and also to check for the presence of field price censoring among
subjects.
The experiment was administered to a non-student population of 2,440 subjects, employing a
between-subjects design. The real public good used in the experiment was verified CO2 emissions
reductions, a natural choice since they represent a real physical contribution to a public good,
are perfectly uniform and individually traceable. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of fifty
treatments, with the experimental price of contributing one metric ton of emissions reductions
lying between 2 and 100, depending on the treatment group.
Based on this design, we estimate a direct price eﬀect on the probability to contribute to
the public good that is negative and statistically significant: On average, increasing the price
for supplying a unit of the public good by 1 decreases the probability that the individual will
contribute by around 01%. Estimated across all price treatments, the probability to contribute
has a price elasticity of −031. There is some evidence of non-linearity in the price eﬀect, but
the net eﬀect is vanishingly small within the treatment range. The direct price eﬀect therefore
confirms the theoretical prediction that, all else equal, the number of contributors is a decreasing
function of the price of contributing. Our data do not provide evidence for the presence of a
gender, age, or a culture eﬀect in terms of either levels or elasticities. We find, however, support
probability that some positive contribution will be given. See Huck and Rasul (2011) for a careful discussion of
the possible mechanisms at work.

public goods.5
The paper proceeds as follows: We explain the experimental design considerations and procedures in Section 2. Section 3 presents the empirical analysis and discusses the results. Section
4 concludes.

Experimental design

The estimation of the direct price eﬀect on the individual probability of contributing relies on
an experimental design that manipulates the price of giving to a public good. Basic economic
intuition dictates that in a suﬃciently heterogeneous and large population, a higher price of
giving will be associated with fewer individuals deciding in favor of contributing. The intuition
can be confirmed by introducing a unit price for the public good into a variant of Andreoni’s
1989, 1990 classical impurely altruistic model.6 The experimental implementation of the intuition
combines the idea of direct price variation by the experimenter (e.g. Andreoni and Miller 2002,
Andreoni and Vesterlund 2001) with the idea of controlled contributions to a public good or a
charity explored by Kingma (1989), Eckel and Grossman (1996), Karlan and List (2007), Eckel
and Grossman (2008), Karlan et al. (2011), to name just a few. The core feature of the treatment
condition consists of diﬀerent units of experimental pay-oﬀ that subjects have to give up in order
to contribute one unit of the real public good. The real public good are verified CO2 emissions
reductions7 and the unit is one metric ton. The emissions reduction is realized in the form of
the documented and verifiable retirement (“deletion”) of an emissions allowance (EUA) under
the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). Retiring one EUA lowers the total
ceiling of the Scheme, and hence emissions, by one ton.8
5 The same design can be used to draw conclusions about individuals’ willingness to pay for voluntary climate
action. See Diederich and Goeschl (2013) for an implementation.
6 In this model and its variants in the literature, the price of the public good is conventionally normalized to
one along with the private good. We provide a formal proof of the proposition that the number of contributors in
a suﬃciently heterogeneous population decreases in the price of contributing to the public good in the appendix
to this paper.
7 Economists have long noted that voluntary emissions reductions to mitigate climate change constitute a close
empirical counterpart to a contribution in a large public goods game (e.g. Nordhaus 1993). An obvious prerequisite
is that subjects agree with the economists’ characterization. We come to this in the next subsection.
8 Among several possibilities, the regulatory framework of the EU ETS, regulating the bulk of industrial CO
2
emissions across EU member states, provides the most reliable and transparent technology for real contributions
to global greenhouse gas emissions reductions in an experiment. First, retiring EUAs avoids the problem of

5

Subjects are randomly assigned to one of the fifty diﬀerent treatment groups, diﬀerentiated
by the price of contributing. The price of contributing ranges, in increments of 2, from 2 to
100, the upper bound reflecting a current estimate of the maximum marginal cost of emissions
reductions per metric ton of CO2 (Tol 2010). Subjects only decide whether to contribute or
not at the given price. They do not learn about others’ choices before, during, or after the
experiment.
Subjects’ choices are implemented under a random incentive system (RIS) (Grether and Plott
1979, Starmer and Sugden 1991, Lee 2008) in order to limit total cost of the experiment. The
RIS is between-subjects (BS)(Tversky and Kahneman 1981, Baltussen et al. 2010, Abdellaoui
et al. 2011) with odds of one in fifty that the subject’s choice (of either cash or contribution) was
realized. On the experimental screens, the BS-RIS is framed as a lottery in which the winners’
prize choices will be implemented.9
Like in most lab experiments, both financial incentives and public good benefits in the present
design are “on the house”. An alternative procedure that was considered would have involved
requiring subjects to give up own money when choosing to contribute to the public good. Our
choice in favor of the standard lab procedure was mainly due to questions of practicality and
the cost of time and eﬀort to the subject of transferring funds in an Internet experiment from
the subject to the experimenter.10 The latter transaction costs are equivalent to an individual
minimum price on the contribution that would be unobservable and therefore out of control of the
experimenter. In the literature, there is an ongoing debate on potential eﬀects of “house money”
on contributions in public good experiments.11 Based on these results, however, there is little
additionality frequently encountered for project-based carbon oﬀsets as the total cap of the EU ETS is binding
and enforced. Second, each EUA is uniquely identified by its issue number and hence individually traceable.
Third, EUAs are not paper currency and have therefore no curiosity value as a tangible private commodity. Total
EU emissions for the trading period 2008-2012, the relevant one for this experiment, were capped at 1.856 billion
tons.
9 Between-subjects (BS) and within-subject (WS) RIS have been subjected to examination for possible biases.
While BS introduces noise and decreases risk aversion, there is less evidence of a systematic bias for simple tasks
Cubitt et al. (1998), Baltussen et al. (2010). In one example, BS-RIS has been shown to aﬀect behavior in dictator
games Sefton (1992) while for ultimatum games, behavior was unaﬀected Bolle (1990).
1 0 For example, the infrastructure of our cooperation partner is not designed to facilitate payments from subjects
to the company.
1 1 The evidence on a “windfall” (Keeler et al. 1985) or “house money” (Thaler and Johnson 1990) eﬀect in
public goods experiments, and if so in which direction, is mixed. While the classic finding is that with house
money individuals behave less risk-averse Thaler and Johnson (1990), Clark (2002) finds no significant diﬀerence
in contribution behavior in a standard voluntary contribution mechanism (VCM) in the lab. Harrison (2007)
reviews Clark’s analysis of the data and identifies a decrease of contributors at the extensive margin by 8% when
using house money. ? use a panel version of the double hurdle model on the same data and find that house money
increases the probability of being a “potential contributor”. Carlsson et al. (2013) find in a dictator game that

evidence to inform whether price elasticities would be aﬀected by a diﬀerence in contribution
probabilities, if any.

2.1

Subjects and procedures

The choice of subjects and the procedures under which the experimental design is implemented
constitute a “framed field” setting.12 The design is administered to a non-student population
of 2,440 subjects drawn from the approximately 65,000 Internet panel members of the German
section of YouGov and are representative for Germany’s Internet using population of voting age.13
The choice of population has some significance for an experiment that relies on economists’ view of
emissions reductions as public goods contributions: Irrespective of age, sex, education, or political
orientation, previous surveys have concluded that German citizens overwhelmingly accept the
empirical veracity of climate change and its anthropogenic cause in the form of greenhouse gas
emissions (European Commission 2008). An exit questionnaire was administered to all subjects
that confirmed the prior evidence.
The Internet experiment ran in two sessions in May and July 2010.14 Session 1 lasted from
May 25th to June 2nd and generated 1,640 complete observations from 1,817 invitations to
the ‘baseline’ treatment. Session 2 lasted from July 19th to 27th and generated 800 complete
observations out of 888 invitations. The recruitment of subjects followed the standard routine
in which panel members are invited via an email message to proceed to the poll via a hypertext
link. The introductory screen then explained, as common with the pollster’s regular surveys,
the thematic focus of the poll (CO2 emissions and climate change), the expected duration (ten
minutes), and the payment (in form of a lottery).15
subjects behave more generously with house money than with own money both in the lab and in the field.
1 2 Following the nomenclature of Harrison and List (2004), our design falls short of a “natural field experiment”
by virtue of the setting, which is familiar, but not natural, and by virtue of the awareness of subjects that their
choices are being observed.
1 3 We test whether our sample diﬀers from one drawn from the general population of German voters. Using
two-sided t -tests, we reject the hypothesis that the means of the socio-demographic characteristics coincide at the
1% level. Our subjects are slightly more likely to be male, younger, and educated than the average German of
voting age. Income is self-reported, and therefore the lower average income in the sample is unsurprising.
1 4 Prior to the experiment we ran a set of pre-tests and a pilot experiment with 200 economics students at
Heidelberg University to test the online implementation and refine the set of texts and questions.
1 5 The polling company usually incentivizes panel members participating in a in polls through either a piece-rate
reward of approximately 1 for 20 minutes expected survey time or random (lottery) prizes, e.g. in the form of
shopping vouchers.

7

Following the introductory screen, there was a filter screen to focus on German subjects.16
Participants then faced a sequence of 10 to 13 computer screens, depending on their decisions.17
On average, 49 subjects were randomly assigned to each treatment group, diﬀerentiated by
the experimental price.18 The centerpiece of the experiment were two screens, the information
screen that set up and the decision screen that collected the subject’s choice. The information
screen explained three features of the experiment, (1) the choice between a cash prize in Euros and
the CO2 emissions reduction, (2) a succinct explanation of how choosing the emissions reduction
results in a real, reliable, and verifiable reduction in EU CO2 emissions through the deletion of
an EUA, and (3) an explanation of the RIS with odds of 100 in every 5,000.19 Furthermore,
the text reminded subjects of the purely public nature of the contribution. Like in other field
experiments on public and charitable goods, the instructions did not contain further information
on what the precise public goods eﬀects of a contribution are.20 Instructions were kept short
and simple in order to avoid well-known biases and potential misinterpretations that arise when
providing subjects with potentially choice-relevant information about the public good around
the time of the contribution decision (Arrow et al. 1993).
The decision screen of the experiment explained how the subject’s choice would materialize
if the subject was drawn as a winner.21 The screen then collected the subject’s choice of either
the specific cash award or the real emissions reduction, which were presented on the screen in
a randomized ordering. Subjects that chose the cash prize were automatically directed to a
screen that provided them with an non-incentivized opportunity to explain their choice, which
we describe in more detail below.
1 6 Subjects

of other nationalities were redirected to other surveys running at the same time.
screens required an answer for each question by entering text or choosing at least one of the options given
(including “I don’t know” options) before being able to proceed to the subsequent screen. This helps to prevent
subjects from “rushing” through a survey.
1 8 The smallest group contained 31, the largest 66 subjects (standard deviation 6.4 subjects).
1 9 The number of participants implied here is due to additional treatments running at the same time.
2 0 When subjects are invited to contribute to give to a liberal political organization (Karlan and List 2007,
Karlan et al. 2011), a public radio station (Eckel and Grossman 2008), to a children project of an opera house
(Huck and Rasul 2011), or to CO 2 emissions reductions, information about productivity should matter. Despite
this, giving decisions are typically poorly informed (Krasteva and Yildirim 2013). Other authors also find that
when given the opportunity, subjects take only modest eﬀort to access additional relevant information (Berrens
et al. 2004) and no more than one third of subjects have a positive willingness to pay for relevant information
(Fong and Oberholzer-Gee 2011).
2 1 As in other polls by the polling company, all winners would be informed via a personal email message. Cash
prizes were directly credited to the subject’s personal account with the polling company. A member’s account
balance can be converted into a variety of shopping vouchers or, having reached a threshold of  50, wired to the
member’s bank account. The retirement of EUA issue numbers was verifiable through a public-sector Internet
site.

widths of  500.

The experiment concluded22 with a set of follow-up questions eliciting subjects perceptions
and beliefs about EUAs and emission reductions as well as sociodemographics (age, gender,
income, education, residence). Correlation of the latter variables with subjects’ profiles on record
with YouGov was checked. The nature of the Internet experiment also allowed us to observe
when exactly subjects completed the experiment and how much time subjects spent at each
screen. Table 1 presents summary statistics of the sociodemographics.

2.2

Field price censoring

A well-understood challenge created by directly varying prices in order to determine the price
eﬀect is that it can give rise to field price censoring (Harrison and List 2004). Field price censoring, henceforth FPC, arises because prices for goods within the experiment are diﬃcult to
isolate from prices of those same goods or close substitutes in the real world (?Cherry et al.
2004, Harrison et al. 2004). In other words, there is a possibility that subjects perceive an arbitrage opportunity introduced by the experiment, biasing the observable contribution decision.
In the present experiment, subjects who would otherwise have chosen the public good contribution might choose the cash prize instead because they believe that they are able to provide an
equivalent CO2 emissions reduction at a lower total cost (including time and transaction costs)
than the prize oﬀered as an alternative.23
2 2 Between subjects’ choices and the questionnaire, the experiment administered a second choice containing a
treatment condition. This paper focuses on the independent first choice only.
2 3 For our purposes, FPC is present if a subject with a reservation price for the public goods contribution
 accepts the experiment cash prize  even though    simply because the field price of an equivalent
contribution in the field ˆ estimated by the subject (inclusive of transaction costs) obeys   ˆ . In cases
then where     ˆ , the experimenter may mistakenly conclude that the unobservable reservation price 
is smaller than  on the basis of the subject choosing cash instead of the good and therefore systematically
understate the probability to contribute. Since there is no secondary market for retired EUAs, we need not be
concerned about the situation ˆ     in which subjects opt for the EUA despite    in order to pocket

9

Two aspects are relevant for detecting the possible presence of FPC in the experiment. First,
it is relatively costly for private individuals to purchase and delete EUAs at the going spot price
(15 per metric ton at the time of the experiment)–a fact that largely excludes the possibility
of FPC from perfect substitutes.24 A subset of subjects may be aware that a variety of imperfect
substitutes exist at diﬀerent prices and degrees of substitutability. The alternatives range from
close substitutes such as having a EUA retired through a broker25 or purchasing an emissions
oﬀset based on a carbon reduction project26 to more remote substitutes such as making costly
changes in everyday life to reduce one’s own carbon footprint.
The second issue is that the researcher should expect a high degree of heterogeneity in subjects’ knowledge about these substitutes and thus, in the levels of perceived field prices. In fact,
subjects’ information status and FPC may be interrelated phenomena: uninformed subjects may
have an incentive to opt for the cash prize in order to make an informed decision later.27 In
the context of the experiment, therefore, there is no single explicit field price that will censor all
responses. Instead, FPC would be driven by subjects’ possible perception that field opportunities
are available at certain prices (Harrison et al. 2004).
To detect subjects potentially constrained by FPC without interfering with subjects’ information status, we follow the strategy of a debriefing questionnaire as in Coller and Williams
(1999) and ?. Our identification strategy is threefold and consists of several follow-up questions
after subjects chose their desired prize. First, we gave subjects who chose the cash price the
opportunity to agree to three statements following the decision screen. As a result, this FPC
“filter” contained all subjects that did not check the first option (‘Given the two prizes, I did
not want to forgo the chance of winning x Euros’), but checked the second option (‘I believe
that there is another way for me to reduce CO2 emissions by one ton for less than x Euros.’) or
the arbitrage margin ˆ −  
2 4 The EU ETS gives private individuals the opportunity to open an account for a fixed fee of 200. The account
does not include trading, though. Obtaining EUAs in small numbers is not straightforward without an additional
intermediary.
2 5 At the time of the experiment, there existed only very few opportunities via the internet to commission
EUA retirements, none of them in German language. One example is the UK based Carbon Retirement Ltd.
(www.carbonretirement.com) with a price of around 23 per ton of CO 2 at the time of the experiment.
2 6 For example, Certified Emissions Reductions (CER) under the United Nations Clean Development Mechanism
(CDM). Being available at various grades (e.g. the “Gold Standard”, www.cdmgoldstandard.org), prices exhibit
significant heterogeneity. Typically, some grades of CERs were available below and above the EUA spot price at
the time of the experiment.
2 7 Our design prevents this eﬀect to a certain extent since the online survey implementation allows subjects to
search the Internet while doing the survey, or leave the survey and take it up again later. We do not find much
evidence on this behavior, though (cp. footnote 36).

10

made a qualitatively equivalent statement in the open-ended third option (‘I had other reasons
for choosing the cash prize, namely...’). Second, we asked all subjects to estimate current EUA
spot prices and the availability of EUAs to private individuals in the follow-up survey. Third, an
open-ended question in the survey asked all subjects to list existing eﬀorts to mitigate climate
change. Thus, while the first and the third part of the strategy aimed at FPC from both perfect
and imperfect field substitutes, part two targeted perfect substitutes only. Section 3.3 reports
on several robustness checks for our results with respect to a potential bias from FPC.

Results and Discussion

2,440 subjects completed the experiment with a median completion time of 5 minutes.28 A total
of 382 subjects in the experiment contributed to the public good. Of the 2,058 subjects that
decided not to contribute, 86 subjects expressed some form of disbelief about the payment or the
real provision of the public good in answers to open-ended survey questions and were excluded
from the subsequent analysis.29 We observe contributions in each of the fifty price treatments
between 2 and 100. In forty-eight treatments, the share of contributors exceeds zero at the
5% level of significance, using a one sided t-test.30
The parametric analysis of subjects’ discrete choice is based on a probit model. We estimate
five specifications of increasing richness. The most parsimonious estimation of the direct price
eﬀect has the form

Pr( = 1) = 0 + 1  + 
with  = 1 if subject  chose the contribution to the public good and  denoting the cash
prize oﬀered to subject . In several steps, in which additional controls are introduced, we arrive
at the final specification of the form
2 8 Average completion time was 1 hour 17 minutes. The diﬀerence between mean and median is largely driven
by a small fraction of outliers (approx. 3%) in which subjects availed themselves of the opportunity to leave the
survey and continue hours or days later.
2 9 Results are not sensitive to their inclusion or exclusion.
3 0 The two prices at which contributions do not exceed zero in statistically significant way are the treatments
with a price of contributing of 50 and 56.

driven by a vector  of the subject’s attributes as well as for interaction eﬀects between the
price of contributing and the attributes  .
Tables 2 and 3 report the probit coeﬃcient estimates and the marginal eﬀects, respectively, of
the five specifications. The first two columns in both tables report on price-only specifications:
Column 1 corresponds to model 1 while column 2 estimates a linear and a non-linear price
eﬀect. The second three columns augment the price-only model by including sociodemographic
attributes and additional controls for experimental session, day, and daytime. Column 3 shows
the coeﬃcient estimates of the linear price model with controls for the standard suite of subjects’
sociodemographic attributes. Column 4 and 5 report on the results of the final specification
above, with column 4 (5) excluding (including) a possible non-linearity of the price eﬀect.

3.1

The Direct Price Eﬀect

Theory predicts that a higher price of contributing will be associated with a lower probability to
contribute. Our data confirms this prediction: The marginal eﬀects reported in Table 3 imply
that raising the price of the contribution by 1 at the sample mean decreases the propensity
to contribute to the public good by approximately 01%. The eﬀect has the predicted negative
sign and is significant at the 1% level. The eﬀect is also robust: Comparing the magnitude of
the linear price eﬀect across specifications (columns 1, 4, and 5), the magnitude of the price
eﬀect changes only slightly when allowing for both price and non-price eﬀects. Converting the
direct price eﬀect into a measure of elasticity, we calculate the elasticity of the probability of
contributing31 based on column 1 as −031 (standard error 009).
While in line with theoretical predictions, the evidence generated by direct price variation
contrasts somewhat with the reported evidence based on indirect variation. Not all papers on
the topic report on how indirect price variation impacts on the decision whether to contribute

(e.g. Eckel and Grossman 2003). Those that do tend to find that variations in match rates or
rebates do not have a significant impact on the share of contributors in the population. Karlan
and List (2007), Karlan et al. (2011) and Eckel and Grossman (2008) conduct field experiments
for political campaign organizations and public broadcasting services, respectively. Even though
the experimenters oﬀer match or rebate rates that reduce the price of giving by as much as 66%,
response rates in the population do not vary systematically with the indirect price variation.
Likewise, Huck and Rasul (2011) examine contributions to an educational program maintained
by a large opera theater and do not find an eﬀect on the propensity to contribute when introducing
a match.32 . Smith et al. (1995) examine contributions to rural health care facilities in Montana
and do not find a significant eﬀect of the rate of tax rebate on the decision whether to make a
charitable contribution.33
The diﬀerence between the direct price eﬀect on the probability to contribute and the previous
evidence based on indirect price variation could be driven by several diﬀerent factors. One
possibility is a bias in reporting evidence: While previous research has stressed that the drivers
of whether and of how much to contribute may be diﬀerent (Smith et al. 1995), some studies do
not report separately how the decision whether to contribute is impacted by the variation in the
indirect price of giving. Those that report on the contribution decision may do so particularly
because of the surprising result that they do not find an eﬀect. A second possibility is that
experiments using indirect price variations would have found a price eﬀect in the contribution
decision at larger sample sizes. Finally, an explanation could be that indirect and direct price
variation are not behaviorally equivalent when subjects decide whether to contribute to a public
good (Eckel and Grossman 2003, Davis and Millner 2005, Eckel and Grossman 2008).
Before turning to possibility of FPC as a potential bias, one objection to the result that
could be raised regarding the size of the direct price eﬀect is the possibility of an anchoring
eﬀect. When subjects are poorly informed or unfamiliar with the good (Green 1992, List and
3 2 Huck and Rasul (2011), however, find an eﬀect of introducing a lead donor, pointing to the important
confounding eﬀect that arises when matches and lead donors are introduced simultaneously.
3 3 Some observers have related this evidence to similar findings on the irrelevance of stake size on behavior
in dictator games (e.g. Carpenter et al. 2005). For example, in an artefactual field experiment with an all-ornothing design similar to ours, Bekkers (2007) exploits variations in the size of the experimental endowment,
which range between 6 and 11. He finds that the probability that a subject will donate this amount to a
charity is independent of the size of the endowment. A key diﬀerence to our experiment is, however, that the
recipient of the donation there also receives a larger transfer while in our case, diﬀerent stake sizes always results
in the same physical contribution.

15

Shogren 1999), higher prices oﬀered might conceivably lead uninformed subjects to infer that the
good is more valuable, prompting subjects to choose the public goods contribution. Experimental
prices would therefore confound the contribution decision with the result that the true direct
price eﬀect would be even greater. To test for the possibility of such an anchoring eﬀect, we
re-estimate the model with interaction terms between price and variables that are likely to be
associated with greater familiarity with the good such as subjects’ confidence in their knowledge
about the donation context (confidence in own estimate of the carbon “footprint” caused by
personal lifestyle, confidence in own estimate of the going EUA spot price) and their education.
An anchoring eﬀect would mean that better informed subjects should be more price sensitive
compared to less informed subjects, who would be more likely to base their valuation of the
contribution on the cash prize oﬀered in the experiment. We find a non-negative relationship
between the propensity to provide the mitigation eﬀort and the “information-weighted” price:
Contrary to the hypothesis of the confounding price eﬀect, more familiarity does not change the
price elasticity of contributing (for the knowledge variables) or even decreases it (for education,
see columns 4 and 5 in Table 3). This resonates with experimental findings that price elasticity
does not systematically vary with uncertainty about good characteristics Heﬀetz and Shaya
(2009).

3.2

Non-price controls

There are a number of non-price attributes of subjects that have been examined in the literature
as determinants of contributing and that conceivably interact with the price of contributing.
These attributes include mainly gender, age, education, income, and ‘culture’. Column 3 in
Tables 2 and 3 reports the estimated eﬀect of non-price attributes on the probability to contribute
while columns 4 and 5 report on the estimated interaction eﬀects.
List (2004) succinctly sums up much of the experimental evidence on the sociodemographic
drivers of a failure to contribute in public goods games in his dictum of “young, selfish, and
male”. In the present experiment, females seem to be more inclined to opt for the public good
contribution across all tested specifications, but the eﬀect is not significant. The result is in
line with the currently equivocal evidence on gender eﬀects in public goods settings where the

16

evidence on gender diﬀerences is less clear-cut than its behavioral salience in areas such as risk
taking or competition (see Croson and Gneezy 2009, and references therein). As Andreoni and
Vesterlund (2001) point out, however, the lack of a level eﬀect in social dilemmas may mask
interaction eﬀects: In a laboratory setting, they find male subjects to be more altruistic than
female subjects when the price of giving is low, and vice versa. We therefore test for a possible
price-gender interaction term to allow for elasticities to diﬀer between men and women. The
estimates in columns 4 and 5, however, yield no evidence for a gender eﬀect in the present
setting.
Like gender, age has attracted increasing attention as a determinant of behavior in public
goods settings (Harbaugh and Krause 2000, List 2004). List (2004) and Carpenter et al. (2008),
for example, find that social preferences increase with age in laboratory public goods games and
charitable donations experiments. Also, like gender, the age eﬀect is consistently positive but
insignificant in all model specifications. Again, we test for a possible interaction eﬀect with the
price of contributing, but do not uncover a significant relationship.
In contrast to gender and age, education stands out as highly significant across all specifications. As the results in Table 3 show, subjects’ propensity to contribute increases by as much as
1% for every year spent in education. Education also stands out for an interaction eﬀect with
the price of contributing: Additional years of education are associated with a higher probability
of contributing at higher prices. Education therefore makes subjects decision to contribute less
price elastic.
Both the presence and strength of the education eﬀect are interesting. Many papers studying
pro-social behavior do not report on the educational status of participants. Notable exceptions
are List (2004), Karlan (2005), and Bekkers (2007): In three field experiments measuring social
preferences reported by List (2004), education is either insignificant or weakly associated with
higher contributions. In an experimental study in the context of a Peruvian microcredit program,
Karlan (2005) finds that educational attainment is a determinant of observed behavior in a
number of archetypical strategic situations such as the trust game, but is not associated with a
greater willingness to contribute in public goods games. Bekkers (2007) studies dictator behavior
in a survey-based, anonymous, all-or-nothing version of the game. There, educational status is
binary (with or without a university degree) and a high status is associated with a significantly
17

elevated probability of donating.
Pro-social behavior may be acquired through education, but the strong relationship observed
in the data may also arise from a diﬀerent source. One plausible explanation could be that
education and the perception of benefits from public goods provision are positively correlated,
as is the case for climate policy benefits in the U.S. as survey data indicates (Borick et al. 2011).
However, there is less evidence of this type of correlation in EU countries: 89% among those
with a high-school degree or less and 92% of those with tertiary education regard climate change
as at least “a fairly serious problem” (European Commission 2008). The strong education eﬀect
may also be explained by the specific public good used in the experiment: Emission reductions
have long-run public good characteristics in a complex climate system. Patience and cognitive
ability are therefore likely to matter. A number of empirical studies link cognitive ability and
its proxy, education, with lower discount rates when assessing future costs and benefits and
with overall stronger forward-looking behavior by individuals (Bettinger and Slonim 2007, Kirby
et al. 2005, Parker and Fischhoﬀ 2005). Other studies emphasize the lower cognitive cost to abler
individuals of making decisions in complex settings (Peters et al. 2006). Against the background
of self-reported income, another explanation is that education is a possible alternative measure
of income and wealth. Since both tend to be positively correlated with cognitive ability (Banks
and Oldfield 2007), this provides an additional causal channel through which education could
enter as a significant explanatory variable.
The eﬀect of income is insignificant in every model specification and the interaction eﬀect
borderline significant at the 10% level in one specification. While surprising in the context of the
tax rebate literature (Auten et al. 2002), income elasticities of contribution close to zero have also
been reported in a field experiment on charitable contributions by Eckel and Grossman (2008).
However, the authors warn against over-interpreting the result due to the aggregate nature of
their income data. In the present experiment, income data is indeed available on an individual
level. At the same time, caution is advised as income is self-reported and therefore subject to
potential biases, and 482 subjects are excluded that did not report their income. Data speaks
against multicollinearity of income and education as explanation for the persistent insignificance
of the one and strong significance of the other. The correlation coeﬃcient with education is
positive at 0.29, but excluding education from the regression as a robustness check fails to give
18

rise to a significant income eﬀect.
Previous research has stressed the role of culture as a potential determinant (or not) of contribution decisions in public goods. While some experiments fail to find evidence for cultural
diﬀerence (e.g. Brandts et al. 2004), two experiments on contribution behavior conducted in
Germany (Ockenfels and Weimann 1999, Brosig-Koch et al. 2011) find significant and highly
persistent diﬀerences between East-German and West-German residents regarding their behavior in a so-called “solidarity game”. We test for the presence of significant diﬀerences in the
contribution decision between subjects located in East and West Germany both in terms of level
and in terms of an interaction with the price eﬀect. In both cases, there is no evidence for
a significant eﬀect of the place of residence on the contribution decision when considering all
subjects.34

3.3

Field price censoring

As pointed out earlier, one potential drawback of varying the price of contributing directly and
in the field is the possibility of field price censoring (FPC) among subjects. If present, FPC has
the potential of biasing results. In the limit, e.g. in the context of highly familiar goods, the
presence and magnitude of the direct price eﬀect could conceivably hinge entirely on the fact
that subjects know or believe that they can provide the public good more cheaply outside the
experiment.
To identify subjects possibly aﬀected by FPC, we draw on the FPC “filter” statements described in Section 2.2 as well as on answers to the follow-up questions on EUAs and on eﬀorts for
climate change mitigation. A common problem in debriefing questionnaires that are not payoﬀrelevant is that, while easily implemented, they are not immune to contamination through strategic behavior or ex post rationalization (Corrigan and Rousu 2008). In the context of the FPC
identification strategy pursued here, both a subject’s “filter” statements and his or her estimate
of the EUA spot price may be endogenous to the preceding choice whether to contribute or not
at the given price. The conservative strategy we adopt here is to use these answers to identify
the observations that are potentially subject to FPC and test in four diﬀerent ways whether their
3 4 However, excluding younger age groups who would have spent their formative years after German reunification,
we find a location eﬀect: Subjects resident in Eastern Germany have a 5% lower probability of contributing, with
the highest significance ( = 0047) for those aged 33 years or more.

inclusion causes a bias in the overall price eﬀect. Previewing the results, the available evidence
points against a substantive bias in the price eﬀect on account of omitted FPC. In three of four
diﬀerent approaches, the coeﬃcient estimates for the price eﬀect are not aﬀected, in one case
they are aﬀected marginally.
Table 4 summarizes subjects’ FPC “filter” statements and identifies 511 (259%) of 1,973
cash choosing subjects who declare, by not checking statement 1 but checking statement 2, that
at the given experimental price, they would make a contribution, but chose not to because they
believe they can make the same contribution to the public good at a lower price elsewhere.35
The question now is whether the inclusion of these subjects bias the estimate of the price eﬀect
in column 1 of Tables 2 and 3? If FPC played a role, the estimated coeﬃcient of price on the
contribution decision in the full sample would be plausibly biased towards zero since a rational
agent making those statements would always choose cash, irrespective of the price.
Column (1) in Table 5 reports that the price coeﬃcient of the reduced sample that excludes the
511 potentially aﬀected subjects does not diﬀer significantly from the coeﬃcient of the full sample.
The regression replicates the significantly negative price eﬀect on the decision to contribute in
the full sample (cp. column 1 in Table 2) and compares it to that in the reduced sample. The
coeﬃcient of the interaction term is insignificant ( = 069). Naturally, the overall probability
of choosing the reduction is significantly higher if one excludes cash choosing subjects, leading
to a significantly positive coeﬃcient on the dummy for the reduced sample. We obtain a price
elasticity of probability of −033 (standard error 0089) if computed for the reduced sample only,
compared to −031 (standard error 009) derived for the full sample.
3 5 Among

the 1,973 cash choosing subjects, 276 gave an open-ended answer in own words without checking
one of the two statements. 258 answers provided paraphrases of the given statements and could therefore be
reassigned. 249 of them implied an actual comparison of benefits and costs of the prizes (statement 1), 9 answers
corresponded to a preferred opportunity outside the experiment given the choice (statement 2).

Another way of utilizing the “filter” statements is to assume that all subjects identified by
the statements were indeed subject to FPC and then recode their choice from choosing cash to
choosing the reduction. Column (2) compares the original and the recoded sample the same way
column 1 does for the reduced sample. Again, a significant diﬀerence in the coeﬃcients on cash
prize cannot be established. The evidence based on the “filter” statements thus points against a
significant bias from FPC.
Columns (3) and (4) of Table 5 present the results of the second part of the strategy to detect
FPC. This part specifically targets FPC from the potential availability of a perfect substitute and
is based on subjects’ estimates of the going EUA spot price elicited in the ex-post questionnaire.36
3 6 Evidence for endogenous information acquisition during the experiment, e.g. by searching the Internet for EUA
spot prices, comes from a careful examination of the “time stamps” of each screen in each individual experiment.
The time stamp measures the exact time at which the subject moved on to the next screen. As information
collection requires time for targeted search, search activity should be associated with time delay at screens that
ask for relevant information relative to other screens. We impose ambitious assumptions on how quickly a subject
can collect the information: For example, subjects would need to find EUA prices and information on annual per
capita emissions on the Internet in under 2 minutes. We find no more than 1.4% of subjects with time delays
that would be consistent with information collection. In addition, these candidates do not exhibit above average

Table 6 gives a detailed summary of this variable. About 74% of subjects gave an estimate within
the range of the randomly assigned experimental prices ( 2 to  100) while the median subject
gave an estimate of  50, close to the experimental mean and median. Thus, most subjects do
not seem to be well informed about the field price (about  15 at the time of the experiment).
Comparing assigned experimental cash prizes and estimated field prices, we identify 996 subjects
who estimated an EUA price below the cash prize amount they were assigned to. 1,359 subjects
gave an EUA price estimate greater or equal to the cash prize. If subjects implicitly or explicitly
took their perception of a field price into account when pondering their contribution decision, and
not vice versa, then the choice of subjects who anticipate an EUA price below the experimental
price may be aﬀected by FPC.37
As before, we compare the unconditional price coeﬃcient of the full sample with that of a
reduced sample. This time, the reduced sample excludes subjects potentially aﬀected by FPC
due to their EUA price estimate given afterwards. Column (3) in Table 5 reports on the results.
Again, the price coeﬃcient of the reduced sample is not significantly diﬀerent from that of the full
sample. The corresponding elasticity of probability for the reduced sample is −029 (standard
error 0095).
For the final column (4) of Table 5, we split the original full sample into two subsamples,
one consisting of subjects whose EUA price estimate exceeds the cash prize and the other of
accuracy on the factual questions in the experiment. On this basis, we conclude that endogenous information
acquisition does not play a role in explaining the results and confirm results by Berrens et al. (2004) and Fong
and Oberholzer-Gee (2011). Importantly, this result also means that a potential field price censoring is not a
product of endogenous information acquisition by subjects during the experiment, but can at most be generated
by diﬀerences in information prior to the experiment.
3 7 To a rational agent, the choice would also depend on perceived transaction costs.

those whose estimates are below the cash prize. Column (4) reports on the results of a direct
comparison of contribution choices between the two subsamples with respect to price. The
results show that, first, controlling for cash prize, subjects who estimate an EUA price below
their cash prize are significantly less likely to contribute than those who estimate a spot price
above their cash prize. Second, the contribution choice of the former group is not significantly
correlated with price: the interaction term is significantly positive and, regarding magnitude,
oﬀsets the significantly negative main eﬀect.38 The observed eﬀects in this split-sample case are
as one would expect them to arise from FPC. The test using a split-sample approach is weak,
however, as the result can equally well be generated by reasons other than FPC: First, given the
distributions of the cash prize and the price estimate variables, there are only few observations
for low prices where the estimate undercuts the experimental price. This inflates the variance at
low prices for this group and may prevent detection of a significant price eﬀect. Second, the price
estimate reported by the subject may itself not be independent of the choice that the subject
has taken. These competing hypotheses cannot be tested against each other, given the data.
However, even if there is a FPC bias, it is both small and reinforcing the price eﬀect.
In the third and final part of the detection strategy for FPC, we qualitatively analyzed the
answers to the open-ended question on subjects’ existing eﬀorts to mitigate climate change. Most
comments related to behavioral changes or investments into energy saving measures. None of the
subjects mentioned any type of carbon oﬀset or certificate. We take this as further evidence that
close substitutes and their field prices did not play a role in determining subjects’ contribution
choices.

Conclusion

The relationship between the price of giving a the public good and its private provision is a
natural subject of interest to economists. Empirical opportunities in the form of exogenous
variations in marginal tax rates (for tax deductible contributions), laboratory experiments, and
field experiments have provided the basis for important insights into how variations in rebate rates
and match ratios aﬀect the probability that individuals will choose to contribute and how much

a separate regression for the reduced sample gives an insignificant eﬀect of the price.

they contribute if they do. Among the many results of this indirect approach to price variation,
one finding is that the decision whether to contribute appears to be largely immune to variations
in match or rebate rates. While variations in rebate rates and match ratios can be converted
into theoretically equivalent price variations, recent experimental evidence has thrown into doubt
whether this theoretical equivalence also implies behavioral equivalence. Using price elasticities
derived on the basis of their theoretically equivalent match rate or rebate rate elasticities may
therefore be problematic.
This paper presents field experimental evidence from an alternative approach to examining
the relationship between the price of giving and public goods provision, namely through direct
price variation: We compare across thousands of subjects how the decision whether to contribute
varies with the amount of money that subjects have to give up in order to provide one unit of the
public good. The theoretical prediction of a clear negative relationship between price and public
goods provision is borne out by our experimental data. There is a negative and robust direct
price eﬀect on the probability whether to contribute. We estimate its mean elasticity across the
treatment range as −031. The direct price eﬀect is robust with respect to a range of controls
and with respect to the potential problem of field price censoring. This provides strong evidence
that in the present case, making contributing cheaper through, for example, public subsidies has
only a modest impact on the probability to contribute.
Among subjects’ sociodemographic attributes that we use as controls, education stands out as
a key determinant of the decision whether to contribute. Keeping in mind the possible limitations
of self-reported income data and the lack of an established education-social preference channel in
the literature, the role of education could be due to both cognitive and income or wealth eﬀects.
For gender and age, on the other hand, the literature provides reasons for expecting a significant
role, but both eﬀects fail to materialize in the experiment.
Given the diﬀerence between the evidence on the contribution decision by direct and indirect
price variation, an obvious next research step is to directly compare match rates, rebate rates,
and direct price changes in the context of public goods, preferably in a field setting. This would
be important both in order to confirm independently the nature of the direct price eﬀect and to
quantify the diﬀerences between these approaches in terms of direction and magnitude.

A

Formal proof of the direct price eﬀect at the extensive
margin of contributions

We introduce a unit price for the public good into a variant of Andreoni’s (1989, 1990) classical
impurely altruistic model in order to guide the intuition for the eﬀects of a direct price change
and of non-price factors at the extensive margin. Assume  individuals who derive utility from
the amount of private numéraire , the level of a public good , and their own contributions to
the public good of size  (“warm glow”). Let preferences also depend on a vector of individualspecific characteristics, θ  . Thus, we write the utility function as

 =  (      ; θ  )

where   ∈ [0 1] denotes heterogeneous perceptions about the value of the public good (Karlan
and List 2006). Another interpretation of   is incomplete information about the benefits produced by the public good. In our case,   represents any heterogeneous beliefs about the size of
climatic changes and thus the benefits generated by the total provision of emissions reductions.
Let the public good be measured in units which individuals can “purchase” and provide
P
at price . Total provision is the sum of individual provisions,  =
=1  . Also define
P
− = 6=  . Individuals are endowed with wealth  and thus maximize utility subject to
their budget constraint,

max  (      ; θ )
 

st  +  = 

(1)

 = − + 

(2)

 ≥ 0 

(3)

Substituting for  , the problem reduces to

max  (      − − ; θ  )
 

31

st  +  =  + −
 ≥ − 
We assume  to be strictly quasi-concave and increasing in the first three arguments. Thus,
if we ignore the inequality constraint for a moment, this resembles an ordinary consumer choice
problem. The demand function for  solving the problem can thus be written as

 (  + −  −    ; θ ) 
The third argument in  is the warm glow argument. Taking into account the inequality constraint (3), demand for the public good is

 = max { (  + −  −    ; θ  ) − } 
In order to derive first-order eﬀects at the extensive margin, we take the inverse of  with
respect to the second argument,  + − and add  to both sides. Solving for  gives
 =

¤
1£
 −  −1 (  −    ; θ  ) +  


Given (3), the condition to provide a strictly positive amount of public good is

   −1 (  −    ; θ  ) −  
Let ∗ denote the threshold level of wealth at which individual  switches from non-contribution
to contribution. Here, (3) holds with equality and thus,  = − . It follows that
∗ =  −1 ( −    ; θ ) − −

(4)

Note that the third argument of  −1 drops out since at  = 0 the individual does not derive any
utility from warm glow. Also note that ∗ is not identical for all individuals because of   and
θ .

32

We are now interested in how the set of contributors changes if certain parameters change.
From (4) it follows that
∗
= −1 − −  0

if we assume normality for both goods.39 Thus, an increase in price ceteris paribus increases
the threshold level of wealth for individual , which makes it less likely that individual  will
contribute. Similarly, normality of both goods implies that40
∗
= −1  0 
 
Intuitively, if individual ’s perceived benefits from the public good provision increase then it is
more likely that  will provide a strictly positive amount of the public good. With regard to
individual characteristics, we have already demonstrated that ∗ depends on θ .

Instructions (translation of experimental screens into
English)

B.1

Welcome screen
Dear participants,
we would like to invite you to participate in two lotteries and to answer some
questions about CO2 -emissions and climate change.
Your participation will take approximately ten minutes. In the lotteries, you have
the chance to win points worth up to a three-digit amount in Euros.
As usual, all your information will be treated confidentially.

B.2

Citizenship screen
Of which country do you hold citizenship?
In case you hold more than one, please tick all applicable boxes!

3 9 Note
4 0 Note

that normality implies that any increase in wealth will always go in consumption of both goods.
that an increase of   in  −1 ceteris paribus implies lower demand for , hence −1  0.

33

B.3

Information Screen
“In the lotteries, you may choose between the following two prizes:
A cash prize in points
or
the reduction of carbon (CO2 ) emissions by 1 ton
How will the reduction of the CO2 emissions take place? We will make use of a
reliable opportunity provided by the EU emissions trading system: We will purchase
and delete an EU emissions allowance for you. Emissions allowances are needed by
power plants and other large installations within the EU in order to be allowed to
emit CO2 . Since there is only a fixed overall amount of allowances in place, deleted
ones are no longer available to facilitate emissions. Emissions in Germany and other
EU countries decrease by exactly one ton through one deleted allowance.
Because of the way in which CO2 mixes in the air, it does not matter for the
eﬀect on the climate where CO2 emissions are reduced. What counts is only total
emissions worldwide.
In the lotteries, 100 winners will be randomly selected out of about 5,000 participants. The following two lotteries may diﬀer in the prizes oﬀered as well as in the
payoﬀ procedures.”

B.4

Decision Screen
”In this lottery, you have the choice between the two prizes listed below.

• If you choose the cash amount and win, then the corresponding amount of points will be
transferred to your points account within the next few days. All winners will receive a
short notification email.
• The deletion of emissions allowances will, in this lottery, take place as a collective order for
all winners. For every winner who chooses the emissions reduction one additional allowance
will be deleted. Winners will receive a short notification email containing a hyperlink to
Heidelberg University webpages where they can reliably verify the deletion.”
