    "abstract": "\n\nActual and perceived gender norms are key to understanding gender inequality in society. In this paper, using newly collected nationally representative datasets from 60 countries that cover over 80% of the world population, we study gender norms on two distinct policy issues: 1) basic freedom, allowing women to work outside of the home, and 2) affirmative action, prioritizing women when hiring for leadership positions. We establish that misperceptions of gender norms are pervasive across the world. The nature of the misperception, however, is context-dependent. In less gender-equal countries, people underestimate support for both policies, particularly support among men; in more gender-equal countries, people overestimate support for affirmative action, particularly support among women, and underestimate support for basic freedom. Perceptions of gender norms are highly correlated with actual gender norms across countries but are also systematically distorted. Specifically, using a simple framework we document that false consensus, overweighting of the minority view, and gender stereotyping prevail in our data, with the latter two forces driving the aggregate patterns of misperceptions on both policy issues. Misperceptions of gender norms may obstruct progress toward gender equality but may also contribute to sustaining gender policies that are not necessarily favored by women themselves.\n\n",
