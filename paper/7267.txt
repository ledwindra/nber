No Contagion, Only Interdependence:
Measuring Stock Market Co-movements

ABSTRACT
This paper examines stock market co-movements. It begins with a discussion of several
conceptual issues involved in measuring these movements and how to test for contagion. Standard
tests examine if cross-market correlation in stock market returns increase during a period of crisis.
The measure of cross-market correlations central to this standard analysis, however, is biased. The
unadjusted correlation coefficient is conditional on market movements over the time period under
consideration, so that during a period of turmoil when stock market volatility increases, standard
estimates of cross-market correlations will be biased upward. It is straightforward to adjust the
correlation coefficient to correct for this bias.
The remainder of the paper applies these concepts to test for stock market contagion during
the 1997 East Asian crises, the 1994 Mexican peso collapse, and the 1987 U.S. stock market crash.
In each of these cases, tests based on the unadjusted correlation coefficients find evidence of
contagion in several countries, while tests based on the adjusted coefficients find virtually no
contagion. This suggests that high market co-movements during these periods were a continuation
of strong cross-market linkages. In other words, during these three crises there was no contagion,
only interdependence.

1 Introduction
In October of 1997, the Hong Kong market plummeted and then partially rebounded. As shown in

Figure 1, these dramatic movements were mirrored in markets in North America, South America,
Europe, and the rest of Asia. In December of 1994, the Mexican market cratered, and as shown in
Figure 2, this plunge was quickly reflected in other major Latin American markets. Figure 3 shows

that in October of 1987 the crash of the US market quickly affected major stock markets around

the globe. These cases show that dramatic movements in one stock market can have a powerful
impact on markets of very different sizes and structures throughout the world. Does this high rate
of stock market co-movement during states of market turmoil constitute contagion? Or are global

markets so interdependent that they have similar high rates of co-movement in all states of the
world?

Economists have developed a straightforward approach to measuring contagion across stock
markets. They compare the correlation (or covariance) between two stock markets during a rela-

tively stable period (generally measured as a historic average) to that during a period of turmoil
(directly after a shock occurs). Contagion is defined as a significant increase in the cross-market

correlation during the period of turmoil. According to this approach, if two markets are moderately correlated during periods of stability, such as Germany and Italy, and then a shock to one
market has ripple effects and leads to a significant increase in market co-movement, this would
constitute contagion. On the other hand, if two markets, are traditionally highly correlated, such
as the U.S. and Canada, even if they continue to be highly correlated after a shock to one market,

this may not necessarily constitute contagion. It is only contagion if the cross-market correlation
increases significantly. If the correlation does not increase significantly, then any continued high
level of market co-movement suggests strong real linkages between the two economies—what we call

interdependeuce. Based on this approach, contagion implies that cross-market linkages are fundamentally different after a shock to one market, while interdependence implies no significant change
in cross-market relationships.

Evaluating if contagion occurs is important for several reasons. First, a critical tenet of investment strategy is that most economic disturbances are country specific, so stock markets in different

countries should display relatively low correlations. International diversification would therefore
substantially reduce portfolio risk and increase expected returns. If contagion occurs after a nega1

tive shock, however, then market correlations would increase in bad states, which would undermine

much of the rational for international diversification. Second, many models of investor behavior
(which will be discussed below) are based on the assumption that investors react differently after a
large negative shock. Understanding how individual behavior changes in good and bad states is key

to understanding how shocks are transmitted across markets. Third, many international institutions and policy makers worry that a negative shock to one country can have a negative impact on
financial flows to another country—even if the fundamentals of the second economy are strong and

there is little real connection between the two countries. Even if this effect is temporary, it could
lead to a financial crisis in the second country—a crisis completely unwarranted by the country's
fundamentals and policies. If this sort of contagion exists, it could justify I.M.F. intervention and

the dedication of massive amounts of money to stabilization funds. For all of these reasons, it is
important to evaluate if, and under what circumstances, contagion occurs.

While contagion can take many forms, this paper focuses on contagion across stock markets.
The first half of the paper discusses conceptual issues involved in measuring this contagion. Sec-

tion 2 develops a simple framework through which to interpret the propagation mechanisms of
international shocks. It briefly reviews the relevant theoretical and empirical literature and places

it in the context of this framework. Section 3 discusses the conventional technique of measuring
stock market contagion and proves that the correlation coefficient central to this analysis is biased.
The correlation coefficient is actually conditional on market movements over the time period under

consideration, so that during a period of turmoil when stock market volatility increases, unadjusted
estimates of cross-market correlations will be biased upward. We show how to adjust the correlation

coefficient to correct for this bias.

Sections 4 through 6 apply these concepts to test for contagion during three periods of market

turmoil: the 1997 East Asian crises, the 1994 Mexican peso collapse, and the 1987 U.S. stock
market crash. Each section tests if average cross-market correlations increase significantly during
the relevant period of turmoil. For each of the three crises, tests based on the unadjusted correlation

coefficients suggest that there was contagion in several markets. When the same tests are based on
the adjusted correlation coefficients, however, the incidence of contagion falls dramatically (to zero

in most cases.) This suggests that high cross-market co-movements during the recent East Asian
crises, the Mexican peso collapse, and the 1987 U.S. market crash, were a continuation of strong

2

cross-market interdependence instead of contagion. The final section of the paper summarizes these

findings and mentions the new puzzle of "excess interdependence" found in this paper.

2 The International Propagation of Shocks: Theory and Previous
Evidence
As discussed above and shown in Figures 1-3, stock markets of very different structures, sizes,

and geographic locations can exhibit a high degree of co-movement. Since most country risk
is idiosyncratic, this high degree of co-movement suggests the existence of mechanisms through

which domestic shocks are transmitted internationally. This section begins by summarizing the
theoretical work on international propagation mechanisms. It then proposes a general framework
through which to interpret and measure these mechanisms, and discusses the difficulties inherent

in measuring these channels. The section closes with a brief review of previous empirical work
measuring stock market co-movements and testing for contagion.

2.1 Propagation Mechanisms: The Theory
Theoretical work on the international propagation of shocks can be broadly categorized as focusing
on three different mechanisms: aggregate shocks which affect the economic fundamentals of more
than one country, country-specific shocks which affect the economic fundamentals of other countries,

and shocks which are not explained by fundamentals and are categorized as pure contagion.'
The first mechanism focuses on aggregate or global shocks which simultaneously affect the fun-

damentals of several economies. For example, a rise in the international interest rate, a contraction
of the international supply of capital, or a decline in international demand could simultaneous slow

growth in a number of countries. The stock markets in any countries affected by this aggregate
shock would move together (at least to some degree), so that directly after the shock, cross-market
correlations between any affected countries could increase.
The second mechanism explains how a shock to one country (or group of countries) could affect

fundamentals in other countries.2 This mechanism could work through a number of real linkages,

such as trade or policy coordination. Trade could link economies because a devalnation in one
country would increase the competitiveness of that country's goods, potentially decreasing the
competitiveness of other countries. This could not only have a direct affect on a country's sales
and output, but if the loss in competitiveness is severe enough, it could increase expectations of an
exchange rate devaluation and/or lead to an attack on the country's currency. Policy coordination

could link economies because one country's response to an economic shock could force another
country to follow similar policies. For example, a trade agreement might include aclause in which
lax monetary policy in one country would force other member countries to raise trade barriers.

The final international propagation mechanism, contagion, is defined as any increased market

co-movement which can not be explained by the previous two channels.3 Theories explaining
contagion are based on multiple equilibria, capital market liquidity, investor psychology, and/or
political economy. Masson [1997] presents a theory of multiple equilibria which shows that a crisis
in one country can be used as a sun-spot for another. The shift from a good to a bad equilibrium is
driven by a change in investor expectations (and not by any real linkages.) Valdes [1996] develops

a model based on capital market liquidity and argues that a crisis in one country can cause a
liquidity shock to market participants. This could force a portfolio recomposition and drive a sell-

off of certain asset classes, which would lower asset prices in countries not affected by the initial
crisis. Mullainathan [1998] focuses on investor psychology and argues that investors imperfectly

recall past events. A crisis in one country could trigger a memory of past crises, which would
cause investors to recompute their priors (on variables such as debt default) and assign a higher
probability to a bad state. The resulting downward co-movement in prices would occur because
memories (instead of fundamentals) are correlated. Finally, Drazen [1998] proposes that political
economy can drive price co-movements, such as during the European devaluations of 1993. For
example, if political pressure drives central bank presidents to maintain an existing exchange rate
regime, then when one country abandons its regime, this would reduce the political costs of other

countries changing their regimes. This effect could generate bunching in the timing of economic
policy shifts.
Although these theories of contagion are based on very different mechanisms, they all generate
3The obvious problem with this definition is that contagion is treated as the residual. As a result, we might
erronously accept the existence of contagion because we do not understand or capture the real spillovers between
economies.

7

the same critical conclusion: that cross-market linkages during a crisis are different than during
relatively stable periods. For example, in the multiple equilibria, investor psychology, or political
economy cases, a change in cross-market correlations is driven by a change in the expectations or

beliefs of investors (or policy makers). In the capital market example, a change in cross-market

correlations is driven by investor liquidity constraints. In each case, international propagation
mechanisms are strengthened during a crisis and this shift is not driven by real economic linkages.

2.2 Propagation Mechanisms: A Framework
The last section outlined three broad propagation mechanisms: aggregate shocks which affect the
economic fundamentals of more than one country, country-specific shocks which affect the economic

fundamentals of other countries, and shocks which are not explained by fundamentals and are
categorized as pure contagion. These three propagation mechanisms can be expressed in a simple
model:

x,t = a + 13Xt + yat + 6i,t

(1)

where Xjt represents stock prices in country i, X is a vector of stock prices in countries other than
i, at are aggregate variables which affect all countries, and ei,t is an idiosyncratic shock (which is
assumed to be independent of any aggregate shocks.)

In equation 1 the first propagation mechanism, aggregate shocks, is measured by the variable

at, and the direct effect of these shocks on each country i is captured by the vector . The
second mechanism, the country-specific shocks are measured by X (a change in stock prices in
countries other than country i) and the impact of these shocks on the economic fundamentals of
other countries is captured by the vector /3. Since each form of contagion, the third propagation
mechanism, involves a change in cross-market linkages, contagion is captured by a change in either

or 'y.
One problem with the direct estimation of equation 1 is endogeneity. For example, not only
would economic fundamentals and stock prices in country i affect those in country j, but funda-

mentals and prices in country j could affect those in country i. This is immediately apparent in

8

the two country case. Assume that the stock prices in the two countries are ret and yt then the
structural form determining these prices can be written as:

(2)

= a +8xt +'yat +e

(3)

where at is the same aggregate shock as defined above and Lx and e, are idiosyncratic and inde-

pendent country-specific shocks. In order to estimate this structural form in equations 2 and 3, it
is necessary to find exogenous events (such as high frequency news) to identify the parameters. In
most cases, however, this procedure is not feasible, since it depends on finding events which affect

only one equation. In other words, in order to identify [3 it is necessary to find events such that

= 0 and e 0.
There is, however, an alternative procedure to test for contagion. This procedure focuses on
the reduced form (a variant of equation 1 which will be discussed below) and tests for significant
changes in parameter estimates across periods. More specifically, if real cross-country linkages do

not change across time, then the coefficients of equation 1 should remain constant across periods.
If we force the coefficients to be equal across time and estimate equation 1 for the full period under

consideration and for a shorter period of market turmoil, then any changes in actual coefficient
values during the period of market turmoil will be reflected as changes in the variance-covariance

matrix. A significant change in the variance-covariance matrix during this turmoil period would
therefore indicate a shift in cross-market linkages—i.e. contagion. The disadvantage of this test is

that since the actual parameters of equation 1 can not be accurately computed, it is impossible to
estimate the strength of the various real propagation mechanisms. The advantage of this procedure,

however, is that it tests for contagion but does not require us to make any difficult (or impossible)
identification assumptions.

2.3 Propagation Mechanisms: Previous Empirical Work
While empirical papers testing for contagion have utilized both of the procedures outlined above,
the majority have focused on some variant of the second procedure due to the difficulty in finding

9

exogenous events to identify equations 2 and 34 Only two papers have attempted to use news as
the identifying condition for the first procedure. Eichengreen, Rose & Wyplosz [1996] utilize the
collapse of fixed exchange rates in the ERM at the end of 1993 (with one country's collapse taken
as the exogenous event) to compute the probability that one country's crisis affects the probability
of other countries facing a crisis. They find that the probability of a country suffering a speculative

attack increases when another country in the ERM is under attack, and that the initial shock is
propagated primarily through trade. Baig & Goldfajn [1998] study the impact of daily news in
one country's stock market (the exogenous event) on other countries markets during the recent
East Asian crises. They find that a substantial proportion of a country's news impacts neighboring
economies.

Most of the other papers attempting to measure stock market contagion focus on the second
approach: testing for changes in the variance-covariance matrix during periods of market turmoil.

The majority of these papers test for contagion directly after the U.S. stock market crash of 1987.

In one of the first such papers, King & Wadhwani [1990] test for an increase in cross-market
correlations between the U.S., U.K. and Japan. They find that correlations increase significantly
after the U.S. stock market crash. Lee & Kim [1993] extend this analysis to twelve major markets
and find further evidence of contagion: that average weekly cross-market correlations increased from

0.23 before the 1987 crash to 0.39 afterward. Bertero & Mayer [1990] focus on how the shock of
the U.S. crash was propagated across markets. They show that the impact differed by country and
that market vulnerability was not significantly related to market size nor average volume. They do

find, however, that the impact was larger in markets with circuit breakers and/or capital controls.
Chuo [1994] and Hamao [1990] further extend these tests by using an auto-regressive conditional
heteroscedasticity (ARCH) framework to estimate the variance-covariance matrices. They find that

there is evidence of significant spill-overs across markets and that this international transmission
of volatility does not occur evenly across countries.
Finally, several papers take a different approach and focus on the long-run relationship between
markets instead of any short-run changes after a shock. These papers use the same basic procedures

as above, except test for changes in the co-integrating relationship between stock markets instead
4This literature is quite extensive, so the following section will only highlight work closely related to this paper's
analysis.

of in the variance-covariance matrix. For example, Longin & Slonik [1995] consider seven OECD

countries from 1960 to 1990 and report that average correlations in stock market retnrns between

the U.S. and other countries have risen by abont 0.36 over this period.5 This approach is a very
weak test for contagion, however, since it assumes that real linkages between markets (such as trade

flows or monetary coordination) remain constant. If tests show that the co-integrating relationship
has increased over time, this suggests either contagion or an increase in real cross-market linkages
(which is likely given the long time periods under consideration.)

3 Measuring Contagion
3.1 Bias in the Correlation Coefficient
While these empirical tests for stock market contagion have utilized a number of different method-

ologies and procedures, the analytic tool underlying this work is the unadjusted correlation coef-

ficient. This section shows that this unadjusted correlation coefficient is biased, and this bias is
especially large during the periods of market turmoil that are the focus of these tests. This discussion builds on Ronn [1998], which addresses this bias in the estimation of intra-market correlations

in stocks and bonds.6 Ronn, however, utilizes more restrictive assumptions to prove this bias and
does not apply this issue to the measurement of cross-market correlations or to any form of conta-

gion. For simplicity, in the discussion below we focus on the intuition behind this bias in the two
market case. Appendix A presents a more formal proof.
Assume x and y are stochastic variables which represent stock market returns (in two different

markets) and these returns are related according to the equation:

(4)

where E [Ct] = 0,

E [e?] < oo, and E [xtet] = o.7 Note that it is not necessary to make any further

5For further examples of tests based in co-integration, see Cashin et a!. [1995] or Chou et al. [1994].
6Ronn [1998] indicates that this result was first proposed by Rob Stambaugh in a discussion of the Karolyi and
Stulz [1995] paper at the May NBER Conference on Financial Risk Assessment and Management.
7These assumptions are critical to obtain the results reported in this paper. If endogeneity or aggregate unobservable shocks exist, then the Causs-Markov assumptions are not satisfied and the adjustment to the correlation
11

assumptions about the distribution of the residuals. Also, for the purpose of this discussion, assume

that /I < 1.(The appendix shows that this assumption may be dropped.) Then divide the sample
into two sets, so that the variance of Xt is lower in one group (1) and higher in the second group

(h.) In terms of the previous discussion, the low-variance group is the period of relative market
stability and the high-variance group is the period of market turmoil.
Next, since E [xtet] = 0 by assumption, OLS estimates of equation 4 are consistent and efficient

for both groups and 13h = /31. By construction we know that a > a , which when combined
with the standard definition of /3:

h

(5)

implies that cr, > a,. In other words, the cross-market covariance is higher in the second group,
and this increase in the cross-market covariance from that in the first group is directly proportional

to the increase in the variance of x.
Meanwhile, according to 4, the variance of y is:

(J = /32 +
Since the variance of the residual is constant and i/I < 1, the increase in the variance of y across
groups is less than proportional to the increase in the variance of x. Therefore,

(\h (\ul
\?J?JJ

coefficient

(6)

is slightly different than that presented here. We do not use this alternative adjustment in this paper,

however, since it is extremely difficult (and impossible in many cases) to estimate for stock markets. Rigobon [1998]
discusses these issues in more depth. Preliminary results from Rigobon [1998] suggest that any endogeneity and/or
unobservable aggregate shocks have little impact on the results reported in this paper. Alternative test procedures
which address these problems reinforce the results reported below.

12

Finally, substitute 5 into the standard definition of the correlation coefficient:
P

cx
UO

cr

and when combined with 6, this implies that phl > p1.

As a result, the estimated correlation between x and y will increase when the variance of x
increases—even if the actual correlation between x and y does not change. In other words, this
standard, unadjusted correlation coefficient is conditional on the variance of x. The formal proof
presented in Appendix A shows that it is possible to quantify this bias. Specifically:

Pt

where

/1+t

p is the unadjusted (or conditional) correlation coefficient, Pt

(7)

15

the actual (or unconditional)

correlation coefficient, and 5 is the relative increase in the variance of xt:
h

c —
Ut

—

o-xx

Equation 7 clearly shows that the estimated correlation coefficient increases in 5. Therefore,

during periods of increased volatility in market x, the estimated correlation between markets y and

x will be greater than the actual correlation. As a result, estimated correlation coefficients will be

biased upward during periods of market turmoil. Since markets tend to be more volatile after a
shock, this could lead us to incorrectly accept that cross-market correlations increase after a crisis.
This bias alone could generate the finding of contagion reported in the studies discussed above.

It is straightforward to adjust for this bias. Simple manipulation of equation 7 to solve for the
unconditional correlation yields:

Pt=

(8)

1+6 [l_(p)2]
To clarify the intuition and relevance of this adjustment, Figure 4 graphs the correlation in

13

stock market returns between Hong Kong and the Philippines during 1997.8 The dashed line is
the unadjusted correlation in daily returns (pr), and the solid line is the adjusted correlation (Pt).
While the two lines tend to move up and down together, the bias generated by changes in market

volatility is clearly significant. During the relatively stable period in the first half of 1997, the
unadjusted correlation is always lower than the adjusted correlation. On the other hand, during
the relatively tumultuous period of the fourth quarter, the unadjusted correlation is significantly

greater than the adjusted correlation. Tests based on the unadjusted correlations would find a
significant increase in cross-market correlations in the fourth quarter and would therefore indicate

contagion. On the other hand, the adjusted correlations do not increase by nearly as much, so an
analysis based on these unconditional correlations might not suggest contagion.

To summarize, most tests for contagion examine if cross-market correlations increase after a
shock. Since the correlation coefficient central to this analysis is biased upward during periods of
market turmoil, estimated correlation coefficients will increase—even though actual correlations may

remain relatively constant. This could incorrectly lead to the conclusion that contagion exists. The
remainder of this paper examines if this bias in the correlation coefficient has a significant impact
on estimates of cross-market correlations and tests for contagion during the 1997 East Asian crises,

the 1994 Mexican peso collapse, and the 1987 U.S. stock market crash.

3.2 The Data and Sample
Before performing these tests for contagion, it is necessary to briefly discuss our data and sample.
To calculate stock market returns, we utilize daily values of aggregate stock market indices reported

by Datastream. We perform each analysis using market returns measured in U.S. dollars and in

local currency, and in most cases, the currency unit does not affect our central findings. Since
U.S. dollar returns are used more frequently in previous work on contagion, and also to avoid an

unnecessary repetition of results, we focus on estimates based on U.S. dollars in the discussion
below. (We continue to report estimates based on local returns if results are significantly different.)

Moreover, U.S. dollar returns have the additional advantage of controlling for inflation (under
non-fixed exchange rate regimes).
8Correlations are calculated as quarterly moving averages. The exact procedure, definitions, and data source used
to estimate this graph are described in more detail below.

Next, given this data set, it is necessary to choose which markets on which to focus. Most of
the work discussed in Section 2 examines a small sample of countries-often just the three largest
markets or stock markets in industrial countries. This was a logical choice for the time period these
papers covered (around 1987), because stock markets in most emergiug economies were small and

restricted-if they even existed at all. With such a limited sample, however, it is obviously difficult
to draw any conclusions about contagion within emerging markets or between developed economies

and emerging markets. Since we would like to investigate each of these forms of contagion, and
especially since the liquidity of many emerging markets has increased over the past few years, this
paper substantially augments earlier samples. It considers the relative movements of twenty-eight

markets: the twenty-four largest markets (as ranked by market capitalization at the end of 1996),
plus the Philippines (to expand coverage of East Asia), Argentina and Chile (to expand coverage of
Latin America), and Russia (to expand coverage of emerging markets outside of these two regions.)
Table 1 lists these countries with total stock market capitalizations and average market volumes.9

It also defines the regions utilized throughout this paper.

4 Contagion During the 1997 East Asian Crises
As our first analysis of the impact of bias in the correlation coefficient, we test for contagion during

the East Asian crises of 1997. As shown in Figure 1, stock market values in East Asia fluctuated
wildly in the later half of 1997, and many of these movements were mirrored, to varying degrees,in

stock markets around the world. One difficulty in testing for contagion during this period is that
there is no single event which acts as a clear catalyst behind this turmoil. For example, during June

the Thai market plummeted, during August the Indonesian market cratered, and in mid-October

the Hong Kong market crashed. A review of American and British newspapers and periodicals
during this period, however, shows an interesting pattern. The press paid little attention to the

earlier movements in the Thai and Indonesian markets (and, in fact, paid little attention to any
movements in East Asia) until the mid-October crash in Hong Kong. After the Hong Kong crash,

events in Asia became headline news, and an avid discussion quickly began on the East Asian
"crisis" and the possibility of "contagion" to the rest of the world. Therefore, for our base analysis

in this section, we focus on tests for contagion from Hong Kong to the rest of the world during
the tumultuous period directly after the Hong Kong crash. It is obviously possible that contagion
occurred during other periods of time, or from the combined impact of turmoil in a group of East
Asian markets instead of a single country. We test for these various types of contagion in the

we define our period of turmoil as the one month starting on October 17, 1997 (the start

1996 to the start of the period of turmoil.10 While this choice of dates may appear capricious,

aggregate shocks, they are a good proxy for global shifts in real economic variables and/or policies

which affect stock market performance. We also show that excluding interest rates, or including
different combinations of interest rates, will not impact our central results.

Using this specification, we perform the standard test for stock market contagion described in
Section 2. We estimate the variance-covariance matrices during the period of turmoil and the full
period (including both the periods of relative stability and turmoil), and then use these matrices to
calculate correlations between Hong Kong and each of the other markets in our sample. We use the

asymptotic distribution of the standard, unadjusted correlation coefficient and do not adjust this
coefficient to account for the bias introduced by changing market volatility. Finally, we use a t-test

to evaluate if there is a significant increase in these correlation coefficients during the period of
turmoil." If p is the correlation during the full period and p is the correlation during the turmoil
period, the test hypotheses are:

H0 :

H, : p<ph
The estimated, unadjusted correlation coefficients for the period of stability, period of turmoil,

and full period are shown in Table 2. The critical value for the t-test at the 5% level is 1.65, so any

test statistic greater than this critical value indicates contagion (C), while any statistic less than
this value indicates no contagion (N). Test statistics and results are also reported in the table.

Several patterns are immediately apparent. First, cross-market correlations during the relatively stable period are not surprising. Hong Kong is highly correlated with Australia and many
of the East Asian economies, and much less correlated with the Latin American markets. Second,

cross-market correlations between Hong Kong and most of the other countries in the sample in-

crease during the turmoil period. This is a prerequisite for contagion to occur. This change is
especially notable in many of the OECD markets, where the average correlation with Hong Kong

increases from 0.22 during the stability period to 0.68 during the turmoil period. In one extreme

example, the correlation between Hong Kong and Belgium increases from 0.14 in the period of
stability to 0.71 in the period of turmoil. Third, the t-tests indicate a significant increase in this
unadjusted correlation coefficient during the turmoil period for fifteen countries. According to the

interpretation standard in this literature, this implies contagion occurred from the October crash
of the Hong Kong market to Australia, Belgium, Chile, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Korea,

the Netherlands, the Philippines, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. As discussed above, however, these increases in the correlation coefficient might result from a bias due to

increased market volatility and not actually constitute contagion.
To test how this bias in the correlation coefficient affects our tests for contagion, we repeat this

analysis but use the correction in equation 8 to adjust for this bias. In other words, we repeat
the above analysis using the unconditional instead of the conditional correlation coefficients.'2
Estimated, adjusted correlation coefficients and test results are shown in Table 3.
It is immediately apparent that adjusting for the bias from changing market volatility has a significant impact on estimated cross-market correlations and the resulting tests for contagion. In each

country, the adjusted correlation is substantially smaller (in absolute value) than the unadjusted
correlation during the turmoil period and is slightly greater in the stability period. For example,
during the turmoil period, the average unadjusted correlation for the entire sample is 0.53 while
the average adjusted correlation is 0.32. During the stability period, the average unadjusted correlation is 0.20 while the average adjusted correlation is 0.22. In many cases, the adjusted correlation

coefficient is still greater during the turmoil period than the full period, but this increase is signif-

icantly diminished from that found in Table 2. For example, the unadjusted correlation between
Hong Kong and the Netherlands jumps from 0.35 during the full period to 0.74 during the turmoil
period, while the adjusted correlation only increases from 0.35 to 0.40. Moreover, when tests for
contagion are performed on these adjusted correlations, only one coefficient (for Italy) increases
significantly during the turmoil period. In other words, there is only evidence of contagion from
the Hong Kong crash to one other country in the sample (versus fifteen cases of contagion when
tests are based on the unadjusted coefficients.)
These results highlight exactly what we mean by contagion. Many stock markets are highly cor'2We continue to use the asymptotic distribution of this adjusted correlation coefficient.

related with Hong Kong's market during this tumultuous period in October and November of 1997.

For example, during this period the unconditional correlatiou between Hong Kong and Australia is
0.56 and that between Hong Kong and the Philippines is 0.39. These high cross-market correlations

do not signify contagion, however, because these markets are also highly correlated during periods

of relative stability. These stock markets are highly interdependent, both in periods of stability

and turmoil, and are closely linked through trade and/or other real economic fundamentals. A
continued high level of interdependence after a crisis does not constitute contagion.

4.1 Robustness Tests
Since this "no contagion, only interdependence" result is so controversial, and especially since

the adjustment to the correlation coefficient has such a significant impact on our analysis, we
perform an extensive array of robustness tests. In the following sections we test for the impact
of: adjusting the frequency of returns and lag structure, modifying period definitions, altering the

source of contagion, varying the interest rate controls, and estimating local currency returns. In
each case (as well as others not reported below), the central result does not change. Tests based
on the unadjusted correlation coefficients find some evidence of contagion, while tests based on

the adjusted coefficients find virtually no evidence of contagion. Due to the repetition of these
robustness tests, we only report summary results for each analysis.'3 We do, however, discuss any
findings which are significantly different than those reported above.

4.1.1 Adjusting the Frequency of Returns and Lag Structure
As a first set of robustness tests, we adjust the frequency of returns and/or lag structure from that

used above. In our base analysis, we focus on rolling-average two-day returns in order to control
for the fact that different stock markets are not open during the same hours. We also include five

lags of the cross-market correlations (Xe) and the vector of interest rates (It) in order to control
for any within-week variation in trading patterns. We repeat this analysis using daily returns and
weekly returns. We also combine each of these return calculations with zero, one, or five lags (as

possible) of X and I. Note that in each case, estimates are only consistent if there are at least

Table 4: 1997 East Asian Crises: Robustness to Adjusting the Frequency of Returns and/or Lag
Structure

This table shows that adjusting the frequency of returns and/or lag structure does not significantly change our central results. When cross-market correlations are estimated based on the
unadjusted correlation coefficient, there is evidence of contagion from Hong Kong to about half the

sample. When cross-market correlations are based on the adjusted correlation, there is almost no
evidence of contagion. No matter which frequency of returns and number of lags are included in
the estimation of equation 9, there are at most two cases where cross-market correlations increase
significantly after the October crash of the Hong Kong market.

4.1.2 Modifying Period Definitions
For a second set of robustness tests, we modify definitions for the periods of turmoil and relative
stability. In our base estimation, we define the period of turmoil as starting on October 17, 1997 (the

start of the publicized Hong Kong crash) and lasting one month. We repeat this analysis, extending

this turmoil period to either: start on June 1, 1997 (when the Thai market first crashed); start on
"Lags are required because we utilize a moving average to measure returns. Therefore, by construction, observations at time t are correlated with those at t — 1, t — 2, etc. There are two methods of solving this problem.
First, include lags in the regression (as we do). Second, change the frequency of the data and reduce the number of
observations. If there are no holidays, or the holidays are the same across countries then both procedures should be
identical. If the missing observations differ across countries (as they do in our sample), it is easier to control for this
problem using the first technique.
Also note that we do not use more than five lags due to the short length of the turmoil period.

24

August 7,1997 (when the Indonesian and Thai markets began their simultaneous, dramatic onemonth plunge); or end on March 1, 1998 (the end of the sample). Also, in the original estimation,
we define the period of relative stability as lasting from January 1, 1996 through October 16, 1997.
We extend this period by three years and one year. Summary results based on these different period

definitions are reported in Table 5.

5: 1997 East Asian Crises: Robustness to Modifying Period Definitions

Modifying the definitions of the turmoil or stability periods does not change the central result;
there is virtually no evidence of contagion when tests are based on the adjusted correlation coeffi-

cients. Moreover, it is interesting to note that when the turmoil period is extended to before the
dramatic Hong Kong crash, tests based on the unadjusted correlation coefficients indicate much

less contagion. When the turmoil period is extended after the Hong Kong crash, however, tests
based on the unadjusted correlation coefficients do indicate contagion. This is not surprising, given

that market volatility increased significantly after the Hong Kong crash (and it is this volatility
that generates a bias in the unadjusted correlation coefficient.) This also supports our hypothesis
that the Hong Kong crash is the most likely catalyst driving any contagion.

4.1.3 Altering the Source of Contagion
As a third sensitivity test, we examine how altering the defined source of contagion can impact our

results. As discussed above, one difficulty in testing for contagion during the East Asian crises is

that there is no single event acting as a clear catalyst driving this turmoil. For example, during
June the Thai market plummeted, during August the Indonesian market cratered, and in October
25

the Hong Kong market crashed. We focus on the Hong Kong crash as the impetus behind any
contagion due to the sudden change in global sentiment after this event. It was not until the Hong
Kong crash that concerns about Asia became headline news, and the discussion began onthe East

Asian "crisis" and the possibility of "contagion" to the rest of the world. In this section, we test
if events in other countries, or even groups of countries, would be a more accurate catalyst driving
contagion during the later half of 1997.
We begin by testing for contagion from single East Asian markets after a significant downturn

in those markets. For example, we test for contagion from Thailand after its June crash, from
Thailand or Indonesia after their August crashes, or from Korea after its two-month crash starting

in late October.(In each case, we end the stability period directly before the crash.)

Next, since contagion may occur from the combined impact of movements in several East
Asian markets, instead of movement in any one market, we construct several indices of East Asian
markets. For each index, we weight each country by total market capitalization at the end of 1996,

as reported in Table 1. We test for contagion: from Thailand and Indonesia after the August
crashes in both of these markets; from Hong Kong and Korea during several tumultuous periods
in these markets; and from Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand (a five-country
index) during several different periods. Summary results for all of these tests are reportedin Table
6.

Source of Contagion

This table shows that altering the source of contagion during the East Asian crises does not
significantly change our central results.15 Tests for contagion based on single East Asian markets

or indices combining these markets all indicate that there was virtually no contagion from these
sources to markets around the world.

4.1.4 Varying the Interest Rate Controls
For a fourth robustness test, we vary the interest rate controls. As discussed in Section 2, we utilize
interest rates to control for any aggregate shocks and/or monetary policy coordination which could

simultaneously affect different stock markets. Specifically, in the formulation of equation 9 we

control for interest rates in Hong Kong, the U.S. and country j.

We

repeat this analysis using
no controls for interest rates, just controlling for the U.S. interest rate (as a measure of aggregate
shocks) and just controlling for interest rates in Hong Kong and country j (to control for monetary
policy coordination.) Table 7 summarizes these results.
This table clearly shows that our results are highly robust to changing the interest rates controls,
or even eliminating them completely.

4.1.5 Utilizing Local Currency Returns
As a final sensitivity test, we repeat the previous tests utilizing returns based on local currency
instead of U.S. dollars. Test results based on local currency returns, with a number of different lag

Table 8: 1997 East Asian Crises: Robustness Tests Based on Local Currency Returns

Measuring returns based on local currencies instead of U.S. dollars clearly has minimal impact

on our central results.

4.1.6 Summary: Robustness Tests
In our base test for contagion during the 1997 East Asian crises, we find evidence of contagion
between Hong Kong and 15 countries when tests are based on the unadjusted correlation coefficients,

but only one case of contagion when tests are based on the adjusted correlation coefficients. We

perform an extensive array of tests to see if these results are robust. We adjust the frequency
of returns and/or lag structure, modify period definitions, alter the source of contagion, vary the

interest rate controls, and estimate local currency returns. In each case, the central result does
not change. When tests are based on the unadjusted correlation coefficients, there is evidence of
contagion in about half the sample (with the number of cases highly dependent on the specification

estimated), but when tests are based on the adjusted coefficients, there is virtually no evidence of
contagion.

Therefore, these results suggest far less contagion from the East Asian crises than previously
believed. Unconditional, cross-market correlations between Hong Kong and each of the countries

in our sample (with the possible exception of Italy) did not increase significantly after the Hong

Kong crash in October of 1997. High correlations between Hong Kong and any other markets

during this period did not result from a significant shift in cross-market linkages. Instead, any
high cross-market correlations during this tumultuous period reflect continued interdependence,
not contagion, across countries.
28

5 Contagion During the 1994 Mexican Peso Crisis
As our second set of analyses of how bias in the correlation coefficient affects tests for contagion, we

compare cross-market correlations before and after the Mexican peso crisis of 1994. In December
of 1994, the Mexican government suffered a balance of payments crisis, leading to a collapse of the

peso and a crash in the Mexican stock market. This crisis generated fears that contagion could
quickly lead to crises in other emerging markets and especially in the rest of Latin America. This
analysis is more straightforward than that during the East Asian crises due to the existence of one
clear catalyst (the collapse of the peso) driving any contagion.

For our base test, we define the period of turmoil in the Mexican market as lasting from
12/19/94 (the day the exchange rate regime was abandoned) through 12/31/94. We define the
period of relative stability as 1/1/93 through 12/31/95 (excluding the period of turmoil). Next,
we estimate the same system of equations as above (equation 9), but replace returns and interest
rates for Hong Kong with those of Mexico. We continue to calculate returns as rolling, two-day
averages and to utilize five lags for

and (L). Then we repeat the standard test for stock

market contagion: test for a significant increase in cross-market correlations during the period of
turmoil in the Mexican market. Estimates of the unadjusted correlation coefficients and test results
are shown in Table 9.

These unadjusted correlation coefficients show many patterns similar to the East Asian case.

First, during the relatively stable period, the Mexican market tends to be more highly correlated
with markets in the same region (such as other Latin American countries and the U.S.) Second,
cross-market correlations between Mexico and most countries in the sample increase during the
period of turmoil. This is a prerequisite for contagion to occur. Many developed countries which

are not highly correlated with Mexico during the period of stability become highly correlated
during the period of turmoil. Third, the t-tests indicate that there is a significant increase (at the
5% level) in the correlation coefficient during the turmoil period for six countries. According to
the interpretation used in previous empirical work, this indicates that contagion occurred from the
crash of the Mexican stock market in 1994 to Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Korea the Netherlands,
and South Africa. As discovered above, however, these increases in the correlation coefficient might

not actually be contagion. Instead, they may result from the bias due to increased market volatility

during this tumultuous period. Therefore, we repeat the above tests, using equation 8 to correct

Table 10: 1994 Mexican Peso Crisis: Adjusted Correlations in Stock Market Returns

Once again, adjusting for the bias from changing market volatility has a significant impact

on estimated cross-market correlations and the resulting tests for contagion. In each country,
the adjusted correlation is substantially smaller (in absolute value) than the unadjusted correlation
during the turmoil period and is slightly greater in the stability period. In many cases, the adjusted
correlation coefficient is still greater during the turmoil period than during the stability period, but
this increase is significantly diminished from that found in Table 9. For example, for the full period,

the cross-market correlation between Mexico and Argentina is 0.40. In the period of turmoil, the

unadjusted correlation jumps to 0.86, while the adjusted correlation jumps to only 0.50. When
tests for contagion are performed on these adjusted correlations, there is not one case in which
the coefficient increases significantly during the turmoil period. In other words, there is no longer
31

evidence of contagion from Mexico in 1994 to any other country in the sample. Even Argentina
and Brazil, which were frequently cited as examples of contagion after the Mexican peso crisis, are

not subject to contagion.
An extensive set of robustness tests supports these central results. We adjust the frequency of
returns and lag structure, modify period definitions, vary the interest rate controls, and/or estimate

local currency returns. While the evidence of contagion based on the unadjusted coefficient does

vary (from 0 to 7) based on the specification estimated, whenever the coefficient is adjusted to
remove any bias from changing market volatility, there is virtually no evidence of contagion.'6

Therefore, these results suggest that there was minimal (if any) contagion from the Mexican

peso crisis. Cross-market correlations between Mexico and each of the countries in our sample
never increase significantly after the collapse of the peso (when returns are measured in U.S. dollars). Any markets which are highly correlated with Mexico during this period of turmoil are also

highly correlated during periods of relative stability. For example, the Mexican and Argentinian
markets are highly correlated after the Mexican peso collapse—with an unconditional correlation

coefficient of 0.50. This is not contagion, however, because these two markets are traditionally
highly correlated—with an unconditional correlation coefficient during the entire period of 0.40.
Cross-market correlations are therefore not significantly different during the peso crisis. These two

stock markets are highly interdependent, both in periods of stability and turmoil. They are closely
linked through trade and other real economic fundamentals.

6 Contagion During the 1987 U.S. Stock Market Crash
Before the East Asian crises and Mexican peso collapse, another period of stock market turmoil

when investors feared contagion was after the U.S. stock market crash in October of 1987. As
discussed in the literature review of Section 2, this period is the focus of most empirical work on

stock market contagion. To test for contagion during this period, we repeat the test procedure
described above. We define the period of turmoil as October 17, 1987 (the date of the original
crash) through December 4, 1987 (the nadir of the U.S. market) and define the period of relative
"Jn all of these tests based on the adjusted coefficients, there are never more than two cases of contagion. These
cases only occur when returns are measured in local currency, and often occur in unexpected countries, such as India
and South Africa.

32

stability as January 1, 1986 through the October crash. Since many of the smaller stock markets in
our sample of 28 countries were not in existence or were highly regulated at this time, we focus only

on the ten largest stock markets (including the U.S.). Once again, we focus on two-day, rollingaverage, U.S. dollar returns and control for five lags of returns and interest rates. Results based on
the unadjusted and adjusted correlation coefficients are reported in Tables 11 and 12.

Table 12: 1987 U.S. Stock Market Crash: Adjusted Correlation Coefficients
Most patterns are similar to those found after the 1997 East Asian crises and 1994 Mexican peso

collapse. First, tests for a significant increase in cross-market correlations based on the unadjusted
correlation coefficients show a substantial amount of contagion—in almost one-half of the sample.

Second, when the correlation coefficients are adjusted to correct for changing market volatility,
these tests find no evidence of contagion. Third, many of the adjusted cross-market correlations
are relatively large during the period of turmoil, but since there is no significant change in crossmarket linkages, these large correlations indicate a high level of interdependence, and not contagion,

across countries.

Finally, as discussed in Section 4, these results may not be robust to: adjusting the frequency

of returns and lag structure; modifying period definitions; varying the interest rate controls; and
33

estimating local currency returns. We repeat each of these sensitivity tests and find that results are

extremely robust. When tests are based on the unadjusted correlation coefficient, there is always

contagion from the U.S. to several markets after the October crash. When tests are based on the
adjusted correlation coefficients, there is never more than one case of contagion (and usually zero

cases). This is in sharp contrast to the papers discussed in Section 2. Each of these earlier papers
which tested for contagion after the 1987 U.S. stock market crash found evidence of a significant
increase in cross-market linkages during this period. None of these papers, however, adjusted the

correlation coefficient to correct for changing market volatility. The extensive robustness tests
performed for this paper show that after adjusting the correlation coefficient to remove this bias,

there is virtually no evidence of contagion from the U.S. to other major stock markets after the
1987 crash.

7 Conclusions and a New Puzzle
The first three sections of this paper discuss concepts underlying the measurement of stock market co-movements and the conventional techniques of testing for contagion across these markets.
Section 2 develops a simple framework through which to interpret international propagation mech-

anisms and explains how contagion is defined as a significant shift in these mechanisms during

periods of crisis. Section 3 shows that the correlation coefficient underlying these conventional
tests for contagion is biased. This correlation coefficient is actually conditional on market volatility

over the time period under consideration, so that during a period of turmoil when stock market
volatility increases, unadjusted estimates of cross-market correlations will be biased upward. This
can erroneously lead us to accept that contagion occurred. We show a simple method of adjusting
the correlation coefficient to correct for this bias. This adjusted correlation coefficient, while clearly

an improvement over that used in past work measuring stock market co-movements, can still be
biased by the presence of endogeneity or unobservable aggregate shocks.

The final three sections of the paper apply these concepts to test for contagion during three
periods of market turmoil: the 1997 East Asian crises, the 1994 Mexican peso collapse, and the
1987 U.S. stock market crash. Each section performs a number of tests evaluating if average cross-

market correlations increase significantly during the relevant period of turmoil. In each of these

periods, tests based on the unadjusted correlation coefficients suggest that there was contagion in
several markets. When the same tests are based on the adjusted correlation coefficients, however,
the incidence of contagion falls dramatically—to zero in most cases. These results are highly robust

to: adjusting the frequency of returns and/or lag structure; modifying period definitions; altering
the source of contagion; varying the interest rate controls; and estimating local currency returns.

Three key results continually emerge from this battery of tests. First, when testing for contagion across stock markets, it is critically important to measure market co-movements accurately.
Adjusting the correlation coefficient to correct for changing market volatility will not only affect
estimates of cross-market correlations, but can significantly reduce estimates of stock market con-

tagion. Second, when these adjusted correlation coefficients are applied to the standard tests for
contagion, we find significantly less evidence of contagion during the East Asian crises, the Mexican

peso collapse, and the U.S. stock market crash, than previously believed. In fact, in most of these

tests, there is not a single case of contagion. Third, when these results are combined with the
observed high level of market co-movement during these periods of market turmoil, it highlights
exactly what we mean by contagion. Contagion is not simply a high cross-market correlation after a
shock. It is a significant increase in this correlation after the shock. The high levels of co-movement

across many stock markets during these three tumultuous periods reflects a continuation of strong

cross-market linkages, and not a significant shift in these linkages. In other words, during the
recent Asian crisis, the Mexican peso collapse, and the 1987 U.S. market crash, continued strong
cross-market linkages suggest interdependence instead of contagion.
These key results suggest a new direction for research on stock market co-movements. Focusing

on how shocks are transmitted during periods of crisis, or how international propagation mechanisms change after a shock, may not be the most productive approach. Instead, this paper suggests

that we should focus on why markets are so highly integrated during periods of relative stability
(as well as periods of crisis). In other words, we should focus not on why some countries are so vul-

nerable during periods of crisis, but why countries are always so vulnerable to movements in other

countries. Why do so many markets of such different sizes, structures, and geographic locations
generally show such a high degree of co-movement? Are these diverse markets linked by trade and

other economic fundamentals? Or is there an "excess interdependence" across stock markets in all

states of the world?

E [e] < oo, and E [xtet] = 0. Note that it is not necessary to make any further

assumptions about the distribution of the residuals. Divide the sample into two sets so that the
variance of Xt is lower in the first group (1) and higher in the second group (h) .Since E [XtEt] = 0
by assumption, OLS estimates of the above equation are consistent and efficient for both groups,

so that h =
