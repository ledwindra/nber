    "abstract": "\n\nWe provide a simple framework connecting the distribution of excess savings across households to the dynamics of aggregate demand. Deficit-financed fiscal transfers generate excess savings. The poorest households with the highest MPCs spend down their excess savings the fastest, increasing other households\u2019 incomes and their excess savings. This leads to a long-lasting increase in aggregate demand until, ultimately, excess savings have \u201ctrickled up\u201d to the richest savers with the lowest MPCs, raising wealth inequality.\n\n",
