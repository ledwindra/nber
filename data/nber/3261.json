The premise is that a great deal of technical progress takes the form of product innovations, but conventional economic statistics fail by and large to reflect them. The approach suggested here consists of two stages: first, the benefits from innovations are estimated with the aid of discrete choice models, and second, those benefits are used to construct 'quality adjusted' price indices. Following a discussion of the merits of such approach vis a vis hedonic price indices, I apply it to the case of CT (Computed Tomography) Scanners. The main finding is that the rate of decline in the real price of CT scanners was a staggering 55% per year (on average) over the first decade of the technology. By contrast, an hedonic-based index captures just a small fraction of the decline, and a simple (unadjusted) price index shows a substantial price increase over the same period. Thus, conventional economic indicators might be missing indeed a great deal of the welfare consequences of technical advance, particularly during the initial stages of the product cycle of new products.\n\n",
