The purpose of this paper is to explain deviations from PPP in an economy

incur costs. That lead producers to pre—set the price path for

several periods. The paper derives an optimal pricing rule, including the
optimal pre-setting horizon.

It does so for a rational expectation

which the degree of staggering is endogenously determined. The discussion
focuses on the critical role of the degree of domestic-foreign goods

Introduction

Ample empirical evidence demonstrates the persistence of deviations from

purchasing power parity (PPP henceforth).1 The last decade of floating
exchange rates has confronted us with a remarkable contrast between the

behavior of goods prices and that of the exchange rate.2 The exchange rate
between the U. S. and its major trade partners tends to behave according to a
random walk, whereas changes in goods prices demonstrate considerable

autocorrelation. These observations,taken together, describe an economy in
which variations in the nominal exchange rate tend to represent short- and

intermediate— run changes in the real exchange rate. Attempts to explain
exchange rate movements have had limited and questionable success.3 Only in
countries with systematic large discrepancies in monetary expansion rates does
one find a tight relationship between exchange rate movements and the
differential between the rates of money supply growth.
Debate continues, however, on the economic interpretation of these

observations. Do they demonstrate that the PPP doctrine is irrelevant? Do
deviations from PPP follow a random walk?4 Almost any attempt to model
international transmission must use some version of the law of one price, and
the above empirical regularities raise question about the gap between such
regularities and current modeling strategies.
The purpose of' this paper is to demonstrate that the above observations

regarding the real exchange rate are compatible with a long-run version of
PPP, in which intermediate—run deviations from PPP are explained by a market
structure of monopolistic competition with staggered and unsynchronized price

setting. We take the case for which each pricing decision involves real
cost. Those costs reflect, for example, expensive collection and processing
of information and lead producers to reduce the frequency of their pricing

-2-

decisions. Each decision will therefore involve the pre—setting of the path
of prices for several periods. A producer is facing potential competition
both from foreign traded goods and other domestic producers. We start by
evaluating the optimal pricing strategy for each producer.

NJext, we turn to

the derivations of the rational expectation equilibrium resulting from such a

pricing strategy. This allows us to derive the path of both domestic prices
and relative prices (i.e., the average price of domestic goods relative to
imported goods) and various covariances between exchange rate changes and

goods price changes. The discussion focuses on the relevance of the EPP
doctrine and the nature of the short- and intermediate-run deviations from

relative PPP. The doctrine of relative PPP postulates that in a world of
stable relative prices, exchange rate depreciation should match inflation rate

differentials.5 The paper demonstrates that, in a market characterized by
monopolistic competition and costly pricing decisions, we obtain systematic
deviations from relative PPP in the intermediate run, although in the long run

prices adjust according to the relative PPP doctrine. The effective duration
of the "intermediate run" is shown to depend on the degree of substitutability

of domestic and foreign goods, and the volatility of the exchange rate. Both
of these factors affect the degree of price staggering. A larger degree of
substitutability between domestic and foreign goods would reduce the pre-

setting horizon, and consequently also the degree of price staggering. As a
result, we would approach a flexible pricing equilibrium, where exact relative

PPP would hold all the time. A smaller degree of demestic-foreign goods
substitutability would work in the opposite direction, generating systematic
deviations from PPP.

It is important to note, however, that quite apart from

the degree of goods substitutability, relative PPP is the underlying long-run
pricing rule.

Section 2 of the paper describes the model. It starts with a formulation
of the producer problem in a flexible price equilibrium. This equilibrium is
used as a benchmark for the equilibrium obtained in the presence of costs of

pricing decisions. The section ends by determining the rational expectation
equilibrium for the case of a stable covarianee structure where pricing

decisions are made in an unsynchronized manner. Section 3 studies the
stochastic properties of prices and deviations from PPP. Section 4 provides
concluding remarks. The Appendix derives the optimal pricing formula and the
pre—setting horizon.

The Model
Let there be

Z domestic producers, organized in a monopolistic-

competitive manner.6 All of them face the same demand curve and share the

same technology. Demand facing producer k is given by

We assume that the labor input costs P . To simplify presentation, we
neglect both the potential role of traded input in the production process, and
the possibility that labor is paid according to a CPI index, reflecting the

share of traded goods. The country is taken to be small enough to face a
*

given foreign price, assumed to be unity (P 1)

The only source of

uncertainty is the exchange rate. We neglect the potential role of other
sources of uncertainty (for example, productivity and domestic demand

shocks). The above assumptions can be relaxed without affecting the logic of
the subsequent discussion.

Consider a hypothetical flexible equilibrium, under which a producer k
sets its price

at the level that would maximize its profits. Let us

denote the flexible equilibrium price by k This equilibrium will be used
as a benchmark for subsequent discussion. Producer k is assumed to take its
competitorst prices as given. To simplify notation, lower-case letters denote
the logarithmic value of the corresponding upper-case variable (i.e., x

perfect substitutability we find an exact version of PPP: i.e., a given
change in the domestic price of foreign goods will trigger an equal change in
the price of domestic goods (in a flexible-price equilibrium).

If all domestic prices are flexible, our assumptions regarding domestic
producers imply that all producers will charge the same price, p .

We proceed by assuming the presence of gains from pre—setting the price

path for several periods. Those gains represent savings in the costs of
frequent collection and processing of new information. A related discussion,
though in a different context, can be found in Mussa (1981); Rotenberg (1982)

and Sheshinski and Weiss (1977). The main difference between the present

—7—

paper and their approach is that they consider the role of the cost of
changing posted prices, whereas the present analysis focuses on the role of

fixed costs related to each pricing decision. As a result, their analysis
resulted in a policy of pre—setting a price for the relevant pricing horizon,

whereas the present paper sets a price path for the pricing cycle. This
difference is relevant for the rational expectation solution in a staggered

pricing equilibrium. In this respect, this paper is related to Fischer

Suppose that, due to the presence of gains from pre-setting the price

path, producers make a pricing decision each n periods. (The economic
determination of n is studied in the Appendix.) At the beginning of each

Several observations are in order. A relative PEP pricing rule implies
equality between domestic price changes and the expected changes in the

exchange rate. This holds precisely for the pre-setting of prices n-i

Concluding Remarks

The present paper has demonstrated that observable deviations from PEP
can be explained by the presence of optimally staggered prices in a

monopolistic competitive economy. In such an economy, PEP holds as a long
—run proposition.

Among the limitations of the paper are the assumption of exogenously
given path for the exchange rate, and the lack of a dynamic analysis of the
path that brought the economy into a symmetric staggered pricing

equilibrium. Thfirst limitation can be resolved by adding the money-market
equilibrium condition to the discussion. For example, if we assumed an
exogenously given path for the money supply, we can solve endogenously for the

exchange rate path.10 Resolution of the second limitation seems
challenging. Suppose, for example, that we observe in the present period an

unexpected change in the stochastic structure. We can expect such a change to
trigger a resetting of the price path by some producers. The tendency to
reset the price path should be stronger for those producers that had pre-set

prices most recently. Such an attempt would tend to destroy the initial nonsynchronized equilibrium. An interesting task would be to derive the
equilibrium path that corresponds to such an adjustment.

The random walk choice is motivated by the empirical regularities

observed in the last decade. In principle, the path of the exchange rate
can be endogenously determined if one adds the money market equilibrium.

In such an economy, the exchange rate might follow a random walk if the
money supply is generated by the random walk process (see Mussa (1976)).

of optimal labor contract length, as addressed by Gray (1978). The new
aspect of the present discussion is the focus on the role of' market

structure (degree of goods substitutability) and the presence of
endogenous staggered prices.
