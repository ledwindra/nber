JOB TRAINING: COSTS, RETURNS, AND WAGE PROFILES

AZSTRACT

Using information

on time costs of training and gains in wages attributable to

training I computed rates of return on training investments. The range of estimates based
on several data sets generally exceeds the magnitudes of rates of return usually observed
for schooling investments. It is not clear, however, that the difference represents
underinvestment in job training.
Two methods were used to estimate total annual costs of job training in the U.S.
economy, for 1958, 1976, and 1987. The "direct' calculation uses information on time spent

in training and on wages. For 1976 so calculated costs amounted to 11.2% of Total

Employee Compensation and a half of costs of school education. In the "indirect' method
training costs were estimated from wage functions fitted to PSID data. In 1976 the direct

estimate amounted to between 65% and 80% of the indirect estimate based on the wage
profile. This result represents strong support for the human capital interpretation of wage
profiles.

The estimates indicate a slower growth of training than of school expenditures in the

past decades. Substitution of schooling for job training is a likely cause.

Introduction: Background
The emergence of job training as an observable-albeit still a fragmentary one -has

the potential of filling some important gaps in the empirical analyses of human capital
investments and of related wage structures. It enables us to pursue questions which were

not amenable to research in the past. Thus, while a vast literature, accumulated over
several decades, contains a wealth of findings on volumes and on profitability rates of

educational investments, corresponding estimates of job training investment could not be
constructed. Instead, growth of earnings over working age, known as the "experience wage

profiles" was assumed to reflect returns on workers investments in the labor market,

especially in job training. Indeed, a first (and last) indirect estimate of on-the-job training
costs by schooling level and in the aggregate was obtained using this interpretation nearly

three decades ago (Mincer, 1962).
Job training was used as a latent variable not only in analyzing shapes of wage

profiles but also in the study of labor mobility or turnover. In particular, turnover and
slopes of wage profiles were linked in a hypothesis, according to which training affects

both: on the assumption that some degree of firm specificity usually attaches to on-the-job
training, we may conjecture that, on average, the more training a worker receives, the more
of it tends to be specific to the firm. Consequently, with more training the worker's wage

profile is steeper and turnover slower. This "duality hypothesis' was proposed in a paper
coauthored with Jovanovic in 1981. In the absence of empirical data on job training or
learning, the duality hypothesis provides insights into labor market behavior, as was shown

in that paper as well as in a more recent study (with Higuchi, 1988). The latter compares

wage structures and labor turnover in Japan with these in the U.S. The negativerelation
between slopes of wage profiles and labor turnover is shown to hold across industrial

sectors within each country. Much larger investments in job training in Japan were

3
adduced to generate both the steeper Japanese wage profiles and the much stronger

attachment to the firm in Japan.
As usual, the absence of direct information leads to a proliferation of theories.
Thus, the lack of direct evidence on job training stimulated the development of alternative
theories which attempt to explain upward slopes of wage profiles as devices to economize

on costs of supervision (Becker and Stigler, 1974, Lazear, 1979), on costs of turnover (Salop
& Salop, 1976), or as consequences of job sorting or job matching of new hires (Jovanovic,
1979).

The recent growth of information on job training in several data sets led to
empirical studies of the effects of training on wage growth.1 In my own work, information

available, in the PSI]) panels was brought to bear on the duality hypothesis. Job training
magnitudes were explored as a factor in wage growth and in labor mobility in an NBER

Working Paper (1988): Using information on timing and duration of job training among
PSID men, I found negative effects of training on turnover and positive effects on wage

growth in the firm and over longer periods transcending tenure in one firm. The positive
correlation between general and specific training which explains these results also explains
the apparent paradox that frequent movers' wages grow less in the long run than those of
less frequent movers, despite wage gains in moving.

Another effect of job training which was observed is the reduction inthe incidence

of unemployment among workers who receive training. This is a corollary of the reduced
turnover, as (close to half of) firm separations involve unemployment. Finally, two

important observations bearing on determinants of job trainings are: (1) Workers with

1

See section 2 below.

4
more years of schooling are more likely to engage in job training,2 and (2) More training is
provided in industries in which technological progress is faster.3
The potential signiEcance of these initial research accomplishments is of a high

order (1) They indicate that human capital analyses of labor market behavior based on
proxies for post-school training hold up when direct measures of such training are used (2)
The documented link between training, schooling, and technological change directs

attention and opens serious research on the sources of demand for human capital and on
its role in economic growth.
As we reach better, empirically based insights into effects and determinants of job
training, it is necessary to return to a task which I attempted in an indirect fashion in 1962:

To estimate the extent and profitability of private sector job training, this time based on
direct, albeit imperfect information. Although precise estimates cannot be hoped for, given
the quality of current data in addition to conceptual complexities, orders or ranges of
magnitude are feasible, and should yield insights into important issues, and, at least, into

needed refinements of training data.
This is the primary purpose of the present study. At a time when concern is raised
about the quality of the American workforce and statements about underinvestment in
human capital abound in public rhetoric, an attempt at comprehensive estimates of
volumes of investment and of their profitability is a prerequisite for public discussion.

Also, of great interest to labor market analysts who utilize the human capital approach is a
comparison of the directly estimated magnitudes of training investments with indirect
estimates obtained from wage profiles, as was done in the 1962 study. This is another

objective of the present paper. Such comparisons can help in estimating how much of the

growth (slope) in the wage profile is attributable to observable training processes. If the
magnitude is significant, a link between the two estimates can be used to infer changes in

training investments over time.
2.

Data Sources and Related Literature
Direct information on the incidence, timing, and duration of job training is available

in several data sets. The information represents responses mainly in household surveys to

questions about formal or informal job training or learning in the finn or outside the finn
during the preceding year. The questions are phrased differently in the various surveys,

both in detail and in degree of subjectivity. Nevertheless, the elicited information makes
possible qualitative and quantitative estimates, from which a degree of consensus may

emerge.
The available data on job training suffer from poverty amidst plenty. Table 1

indicates both the proliferation and shortcomings of the data. Although concentrating on
one consistent source of data would provide single-valued results, I attempt in addition to
draw on results based on various data sets to gauge a degree of robustness, if any.
The University of Michigan's Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), an annual
survey of about 5,000 households provides usable information on job training for about
1,200 male heads of households in 1976, 1978, and 1985. The information covers the length

of time of training required during the current job, as well as its learning contents in 1976.
Information on intensity (hours per week) of training is available in a supplementary time

One question asked was: 0n a job like yours, how long would it take the average new person to become
fully trained and qualifled? This question followed another about training prior to the current job,
therefore intending to measure training attached to the current job. Another usable question was whether
the current job provides learning which could help in promotion or getting a better job.

study of PSID workers by Duncan and Stafford (1980). The PSII) data were analyzed by
Duncan and Hoffman (1979), Brown (1983 and 1988), Gronau (1982), and Mincer (1988a).
The National Longitudinal Samples (N1..S) surveys covering several thousand

households conducted at Ohio State University contain annual or biannual information on
job training for two cohorts of young men (aged 14 to 24 in 1968, and in 1979), and for

mature men (aged 45 to 59 in 1968). The new (1979) cohort of young men contains

information on the duration of a spell of training. In-house training reported in the 1968
cohorts were studies by Lillard and Tan (1986). The new, young cohort was analyzed by
Parsons (1986) and Lynch (1988).

The Current Population Survey of the U.S. Census, the largest periodic sample of
US households contains the incidence of training in its March '83 survey. The data were
analyzed by Lillard and Tan (1986).
Finally, the 1982 EOPP (Equal Opportunity Pilot Project) is the only survey of
employers (about 2,000 in 31 areas). It provides information on hours of training of new

hires during the first three months on the job. This data was described and analyzed by
Llllard and Tan (1986), Barron, Black, and L.owenstein (1987), and reanalyzed by Hoizer
(1989).

In my work with the PSID (1988), I compared year-by-year wage growth of workers

in the 1976 firm in periods with training with workers and periods without training. The
effect of a year with training on wage growth in the 1976 job was 4.4% using the 1968-82

annual PSID surveys. No other variables had much of an effect on wage growth, except for

a small negative effect of prior experience.
The effect of training on wage growth was greater (9.5%) at younger ages (working

age 12 years or less) than at older ages (3.6%). The difference reflects greater intensity of

7
training among young workers, as is shown in the Duncan and Stafford (1980) time study

(see Table 3).
The findings that wage growth decelerates with age because training does, and that

no other variable appears to affect individual wage growth indicate the importance of jot
training or learning in producing the typical upward sloping and decelerating wage profiles
over working lives.

The same conclusion is reached in a study by H. Rosen (1982). Using the 1976

PSID data Rosen divided the sample into two groups: workers who received training during

the year and those who did not. (Cross-sectional) wage profiles were steep and concave in
the first group, and very flat in the second. Once again this suggests the importance of job
training or learning in creating the typical shapes of wage profiles.

As in the PSID, all of the studies based on other data sets found positive and
significant effects of training on wages and on wage growth.
Barron, Black, and Lowenstein (1989) use the EOPP survey of over 2,000 employers

located in 31 areas across the country. They measure training in hours spent in training by
new hires and by their supervisors and co-workers during the first three months of

employment in the firm. The mean training hours were 151 in the three months. In a two
year period, they report that training raised wages by 15% or 7.5% per year. It will be

recalled that a year of training in the PSID raised wages of young workers, whose average
age was about the same as of the new hires in EOPP, by 9.5%, and by 3.6% for workers

who, on average, were 15 years older, and who had correspondingly smaller intensity (houn

per week) of training. This is also consistent with the 9% effect per year found by Brown
(1988) for new hires, who had no training before.

8

Holzer's (1989) reanalysis of the EOPP data yields a smaller wage growth effect of

4.7%. Lynch (1988) uses the new youth cohort of the NLS. Here information is available
on all training spells of recent male entrants into the labor force during the 3-year period
1980 to 1983. She finds that wages of young workers with job training during the year rose

by 11%, while an additional year of tenure without training increase wages by 4% the net

effect is, therefore, 7%.
Lillard and Tan (1986) also find significant effects of training on wages in the CPS
and in the 1963-1980 youth cohort of the NL.S. In the CPS (their Table 4.1), company
training raises wages by 11.8%; in the NLS (their Table 4.5), job training raises wages of
young workers by 10,8%, initially, but the effect declines subsequently.

In sum, estimated effects of an additional year with training appear to range from
4.4% in the PSID for all new hires, 9% for young workers in the PSID, 7% for the new

youth cohort in the NLS, and 11% for the previous youth cohort in the NLS. The 12%
'effect' for CPS men is a cross-sectional finding, that trainees have higher wages than non-

trainees, but takes no account of the pre-training wage. It is not included in the
profitability analysis in Table 2.
3.

Profitability of Job Training Investments
Prima fade, these estimates of effects of a year with training on wage growth (col. 1)

are comparable to effects of an additional year of schooling at the average level of
schociling. Yet, viewed as measures of profitability, or as rates of return on the cost of job

training (col. 3), these numbers appear to be much too large.
The reason is that job training is not a full time (full year) activity. If it takes 25% of
work-time during an average week of a year with training, the rates of return on worker
opportunity costs are four times higher than the estimated rates of wage growth.

Let k = h/H, be the fractk'- of wori 11.

roted to job training. Here h are hours

of training during the period (week, month, or year) and H average hours of work during

the period. Let w0 be the pre-training and wi the post-training wage. Then the
(uncorrected) rate of return on training r1 = (Wi - w0) H/w0 h, here the numerator is
the annual dollar increase in earnings, the return on the investment, while the denominator

is the opportunity cost of training. Denoting w = wj - w0/w0, the percent increase in
wages due to training, the (uncorrected) rate of return is r = w/k. The first 3 columns of
Table 2 show estimates of w, k, and r1 based on the PSI]), EOPP, and two male cohorts of
the NLS.

The r1 rates appear to be implausibly high. However, they need to be corrected
downward, if skills acquired in training depreciate, and if the payoff period is short. The

latter factor can be ignored as the median age of trainees is about 30, so that, without
depreciation, the median payoff period exceeds 30 years. Depreciation, however, can be
substantial, as suggested by Lillard and Tan (1986). For the earlier N1.S cohort of young
men they estimated an initial wage gain of 10.8% due to training and a subsequent decline

of 1% per year during years since training. This translates5 into a 12% exponential rate of
decline in returns per year due to depreciation.
My attempts to estimate a depreciation rate in the PSI]) using the Lillard and Tan
procedure yielded a barely significant depreciation rate close to 4%. This much smaller
figure in the PSI]) may be due to the broader coverage of all males, compared to younger
males in NLS: if training has substantial elements of specificity, mobility would create
wage depreciation. Since mobility of young workers exceeds substantially the mobility of

older workers, a smaller depreciation rate in the PSI]) may be reasonable. if the training is
largely general, the difference is less plausible. Consequently, I show rates of return
Half of the gain vanishes in 5.4 years according to the incar estimate. A depreciation rate (d) of 12%
produces a half-life of 5.4 years d is solved from (1-d) = .5, where t = 5.4.

corrected for depreciation rates which range from 4% to 12% in columns 4 and 5 of Table

3. To the extent that mobility affects the depreciation rates (d), the higher values of d are
applicable o th& young groups, and the lower ones to the PSI]) which covers all workers.

The estimate of corrected rates of return (r) is obtained as follows: Given the
annual depreciation rates (d), equate costs or foregone earnings while training (kw) to the
present value of the stream of gains (w) the first year following training,

The rates of return vary widely, depending on the assumed depreciation rates and

the data source. On the whole, they exceed the rates usually estimated for schooling
investments, especially if the depreciation rates are relatively low.

These figures reflect the profitability of worker investments in job training.
The profitability of employer investments in training is not necessarily the same. It

clearly depends on the trainees length of stay in the firm. Thus, even if there is no
depreciation of the skills acquired by training so long as the worker remains in the firm for

only T-years, the present value of the firms investment is reduced from w/r' to w/r1 [1

(1/1 + rl)TJ. Thus (1/1 + rl)T is the fraction by which the payoff to the firm is reduced,
compared to the case of "lifetime' employment. Here the corrected rate r is obtained by

11

reducing r1 correspondingly. The last column of Table 3 shows estimates of corrected rates
of return to employers under these assumptions, given estimated average tenure (T) of

trainees. These estimated rates are still overestimates, if depreciation (obsolescence) takes
place during the trainees stay in the firm, as is likely. If so, employers profitability rate may

be reduced substantially below the upper limits in col 7 of Table 2.
We may conclude that, if depreciation on the job is not significant, risks of capital

loss resulting from worker separations would not produce a strong deterrent to investment
in training by firms, nor a long lasting inhibition of worker mobility.
Thus, the question regarding over or under-investment in training by employers

appears to hinge both on labor mobility and on depreciation rates of such human capital.

Underinvestment cannot be diagnosed if both are substantial. Note also that marginal
rather than average rates of return (of Table 3) are required for such diagnoses, and the
marginal rates are likely to be lower. More research is needed on these factors affecting
profitability as well as on proper measures of time and other resources spent in training,

and on proper econometric estimates of wage gains attributable to training. As to the
measures of time and resources, information from much larger samples is needed than that
of the 1976 Time Use Study, and employer information for the same workers need to be

matched.
4.

Estimating Volumes of Annual Job Training Investments
I proceed to estimate economy-wide annual volumes (flows) of worker investments

in job training, measured in opportunity costs. To estimate these costs we need to know
the number of workers engaged in training in the survey period n = p N, where N is the
total workforce and p the proportion of workers engaged in some training or learning on

the job, the time (h = hours) they spend in training during the period, and their hourly pretraining wage w0. The total training opportunity costs of workers are then the product C

12

= w0 h p N. Information on such statistics or a sample of the whole U.S. labor force is
available only in a PSID survey of Time Use at Work during a week ui 1976 (Duncan and
Stafford, 1980) a part of which is shown here in Table 3. Information on hours spent in
training by new hires during the first three months is available in the EOPP survey and in
weeks in the new NLS young worker cohort. Both cover subgroups of new labor force

entrants rather than the whole labor force. The CPS is a large national survey, with
information on the incidence but not on hours of training.
Table 4 applies the data from the 1976 Time Use Survey, to calculate weekly worker
opportunity costs of training on the job, by age groups. The first three columns on wages
(w), hours(h) and incidence(p) of training are taken from Duncan and Stafford (1980), here
shown in Table 3. Column (4) contains BLS national employment figures (by age) for

1976. Column (5) shows total costs per week; it is a product of cot. (1) through (4).
Statistics on time spent in training by trainees both understate and overstate the

time cost of traim

They understate it, because not only the time of trainees, but also

time of co-workers and of (formal or informal) instructors is spent in the process. They
overstate the costs to the extent that training is joint with production and the marginal
product is positive. It is the loss of production during training that represents pure training
costs. Thus if production during training is half compared to production without training,
half the work time with training should be counted as training time. The PSID Time Use
Survey leaves out time spent by workers other than trainees.6 These additional time costs
plus the costs of materials do enter the picture implicitly when we turn to the question of
how total costs are shared by workers and employers. The Time Use Survey does,
however, list separately hours of trainees spent in training with and without production

(cot. 3 and 4 in Table 3).
6 The time contributions of other workers were listed in the EOPP (Bishop, 1989).

13

Weekly hours spent in training by trainees were obtained as a weighted sum of these
two components: Only one third of time spent jointly with production was considered as a

loss of production, hence as pure training. This is a conservative estimate, but not far off
the mark, judging by the work of Bishop (1989). The sum adds up to roughly 4 hours a

week per trainee.7 Thus the average wage in the age group is an approximate estimate of a
pre-training or non-training wage of trainees.8 The estimates are made separately by age
groups, as all components vary systematically with age, then summed to obtain a total
which was $1.11 billion per week or $57.7 billion per year in 1976.

Expressing this figure as a fraction of the total wage bill (Total Compensation)
which was $1.04 trillion in 1976 yields a 5.6% figure. If the fraction of work time spent in

training did not change over time, so that the same ration held in 1987, it would amount to
$148 billion in 1987 dollars.

Worker investments represent a part of total investment on job training. Employer

investments are the other part. How large are these? Accounting data from employers
usually provide costs of formal training programs That these account for a smaller part of
the total is apparent from the findings of a recent survey (Training Magazine, 1988) where
the average time a recipient spent in such a program per year was 32 hours, much less than
the 150 hours in 3 months of EOPP or 11 weeks per year in the NLS, or the close to 200
hours per year in the 1976 Time Use Study. But even if such data were complete and also
covered informal training, it is not at all obvious that these are costs borne by firms, that is,
that they are not offset by reductions in wages or in wage gains of workers. A nearly
complete offset would indeed be expected, if skills enhanced by training received in the
Tisis is an average for all workers, including women. For men alone average hours are closer to 6. The
profitability esrimates in Table 2 were calculated for men for whom wage gains were estimated in the

PStD.
8 Even if all their opportunity costs were financed by trainees, training costs would be underestimated by no
more than 6%; according to the Time Use data.

14

firm were easily transferable to other firms. Firm specificity in training would, of course,

enable and indeed compel firms to bear additional costs to those of workers. In principle,
the best way to assess how much firms invest is to compare increases in productivity

resulting from training with increases in wages. If productivity increases more than wages,

the excess is the return on costs borne by the firm. Two recent studies using very different
data and approaches suggest that the productivity increase is about twice that of the wage
increase caused by training. This is found by Barron et al. in the EOPP data, where a
productivity scale is used to gauge the increase. Blakemore and Hoffman use aggregate
production and turnover data to estimate effects of tenure on wages per hour and compare
these with effects of tenure on output per hour. They too find a similar- doubling of

productivity compared to wages.
If the estimates of productivity effects are correct and rates of return on training
similar for workers and firms, total volumes of job training investments should be doubled
to $115 billion in 1976 and to $296 billion in 1987.

It is of interest to note that the survey of companies (with 100 or more employees)

published in Training Magazine reported expenditures on formal training programs of
about S40 billion in 1987. Based on a Columbia University survey of a national sample of
firms, Bartel (1989) reports a larger figure of $55 billion in 1987. These estimates clearly

leave out the apparently much larger expenditures on informal training processes. Thus
our conservative estimate based on 1976 time use study suggests that trainees spent an
average of 4 hours per week or close to 200 hours in training per year which is over six

times the number of hours (32) reported for formal training by Training Magazine. If the
hourly costs of training were the same for formal and informal training, a global estimate
based on formal training costs alone would be $240 billion or $330 billion, depending on
which survey in used. Our figure of $296 billion for 1987, estimated in an entirely different
manner, is very much within the range of such estimates. We should remember, however,

-

15

that the validity of our estimate for 1987 depends not only on the correctness of the
calculation for 1976 in Table 4, but also on the proposition, based on some empirical
evidence, that costs of training are shared equally by workers and employers, and on the

assumption that average time (per worker) spent in training did not change between 1976
and 1987.
5.

Comoaring Direct with Indirect Estimates of Training
Extrapolating our estimate of 1976 worker training costs back to 1958 in the same

manner as we did in the 1987 extrapolation, that is assuming that the time spent in training
(per worker) did not change, yields a figure of $14.4 billion for 1958. This "direct" estimate
for the whole work force compares closely with the indirect estimate of $13.5 billion

obtained from wage profiles for the 1958 male labor force (Mincer, 1962, Table 2). Adding
another 10 to 15% of costs of women's training would have raised the 1958 indirect

estimate for the whole work force to about $16 billion.
The closeness of the two estimates is rather surprising. It would imply that at least9
90% of the observed growth in the wage profiles (summed by education levels in the 1958

data) is attributable to training on the job! If other factors affect wage growth positively,
and theories to that effect were cited earlier, the extrapolation back to 1958 of the 1976

training ratio is likely to be too high. At the same time, if depreciation of human capital is
important, the indirect (based on wage profiles) estimate may be an underestimate merely
because it estimates net investments, while the direct training costs measure the larger
gross investments.

The basic assumptions that the same fraction of work time was devoted to training
in 1958 as in 1976 may also be questioned, on the following grounds: All studies (listed
9.

According to calculations in PSID data, job mobility accounts for about 15% of the growth in the wage
profiles of males (Mincer, 1988). Thus the figure of $16 billion is an overstatement.

16

earlier) show a net positive relation between education and the incidence or time spent in
training. This relation reflects the fact that persons who have greater learning ability and
better opportunities to finance human capital investments invest more in all forms of
human capital, including schooling and job training. Moreover, schooling is often a basis
from which job training starts and better schooling may impart a greater ability to learn on
the job. if training is affected by schooling we would expect that an expansion of schooling
would bring about an expansion of training. Thus, the expansion of schooling between
1958 and 1976 suggests that training volumes, measured as a proportion of work time

should have been less in 1958 than in 1976 rather than equal as the extrapolation assumed.
Data in the 1976 Time Study also indicate (Table 3) that hours spent in training
increase with schooling.10 Workers with less than high school spent a little over a half the

hours in training that more educated workers did. The size of the two groups in the labor
force was about equal in 1958, but the group with less than 1. years shrank to 25% of the
labor force by 1976. Hence, average hours of training would have increased by over 15

percent, if hours within each education level remained fixed. If so, the $14 billion in 1958
should be corrected downward to $12.2 billion. Even the reduced estimate suggests that
over 75% wage growth observed in the wage profiles can be attributed to job training!

However, a positive relation between education and training does not mean that
they are related in fixed proportions. To the extent that an (exogenous) expansion of
education leads to a substitution of school education for job training, education may grow

faster than job training. Indeed, (direct) educational expenditures grew from 4.8% to 7.1%
of GNP between 1958 and 1976. If substitution was present, job training grew more slowly

than education, suggesting that hours of training declined within school groups. In the

Table 3 shows tILgross relation with schooling, rather than the net effect discussed in the preceding
paragraph. For the purpose of the calculation here, the gross relation is appropriate.

17

aggregate, therefore, time spent in training may not have grown over the period, in which
case the initial extrapolation may be valid.
The comparison of direct and indirect estimates is less problematic if carried out for
the same year. This requires a calculation of job training costs based on the 1976 wage
profile. The use of a parametric wage function (Mincer 1974) makes such calculation much
less laborious than was necessary when the 1958 data were analyzed (Mincer, 1962). The
human capital earnings functions contains among other variables, a years of work

(experience) variable X which enters in a nonlinear fashion. Its coefficients are

interpretable as (post-school) human capital investment parameters. On the assumption
that time spent in investment declines linearly as working age increase, the expression is:
mw = Z + rk0X - (rko/2T)X2 + ln[1-k0 + (k0/T)X]

Here Z is a set of other independent variables while k0 is the fraction of earnings devoted
to human capital investments in the early working age, T the period in the working life at

which investments cease, and r the rate of return on the net investments.
In a recent paper H. Rosen (1982) estimated these parameters from the 1976 PSID for the

male sample. He found k0 = .32, T = 26, and r =

12%.

Assuming that investments of a

typical woman worker (in terms of k, or time) are half as large, k0 for all workers, is a

weighted average of the male and female investment ratio, the weight being total earnings
(N. w) of each. Since the female work force was 2/3 the size of the male workforce, and
earnings per woman worker 60% of male earnings, the weights are ito .4, yielding a k0 of
.27. Since T=26, k falls approximately .01, or 1% point per year. Thus investments cease

at about age 44. Average k in eah age group is shown below:

The ratio of training investments to wage per hour is Nwk/ Nw = 4 1/484 = 8.5%. This

is higher than the direct estimate of 5.6%. We may say that job training costs in 1976
account for 5.6/8.5 = .66 or 66% of observed growth in the wage profile in that year.
Translating the 8.5% ratio to dollar figures, by applying it to total compensation of workers
in 1976 (it was $1,040 billion) yields a figure of $88.4 billion cost of worker training based

on wage profiles. This figure is reduced to $75 billion, if 15% of the estimate based on

wage profiles is attributable to job mobility," rather than training.
The conclusion that at least two/thirds of growth in the wage profile was explained by
worker job training investments in 1976 is supported by another piece of indirect evidence
contributed by Rosen in the same study (1982). The PSID sample was divided into two
parts; workers who received some training in 1976 and those who did not. Wage functions

of the form indicated above were estimated for each group. The estimate k0 for the group
without training was less than a third the size of Ic0 for the group with training. Indeed, the
experience wage profile was very flat in the no-training group.
Since new information on training was provided in the 1978 PS1D survey, I

replicated the procedure for that year. The linear (B1) and quadratic (B2) coefficients on
experience (x and x2) were:

Note: t-ratios in parentheses;

The growth of wages over a yeur is (B1 2B2 x) It is over 3 times as fast for any
given working age in the group with training, compared to the group without training.

It is noteworthy that three entirely different methods of estimatingvolumes of job
training yield comparatively similar figures, as shown in Table5.

It is also interesting to note that by 1976 directly estimated job training costs (col. b)
amounted to about a half of schooling costs (direct and opportunity costs). In the 1962
study the ratio for 1958 appeared to be higher (first row of Table 5). If a decline in the
ratio actually occurred, the substitution of schooling for training mayhave been dominant.
Apparently, increased public expenditures on schools (including especiallythe growth of 2year colleges) moved relative prices against training.
The comparison of direct and indirect estimates of job training investments
summarized in Table 5 for 1976 (where no extrapolation is involved) suggests that Oil'
investments account for (at least?) as much as two-thirds of observed wage growth in

(cross-sectional) wage profiles. This represents strong support for the human capital

interpretation of the wage structure. As suggested in the introduction, an empirically
substantial link between wage profiles and training volumes can be used to infer changes in

training investments over time. Such changes cannot beobserved directly as training data
are reported only sporadically and fragmentarily. Whether and in what way job training
was a factor in the pronounced changes in the wage structures over the past two decades in

the U.S. is a question left for future research.

With information on time costs of training and gains in wages attributable to

training, rates of return to training can be computed. A downward adjustment is required,
however, as the acquired skills erode due to obsolescence, or to job mobility to the extent

that the skills are firm specific. The range of estimates based on several data sets generally
exceeds the magnitude of rates of return usually observed for schooling investments. Given
data on workers' firm tenure, it appears also that training remains profitable to firms, even
in the face of average worker mobility.
The rates of return here calculated may suggest underinvestrnent in training,
relative to that in schooling. However, such comparisons must be qualified, in two
respects: (1) Schooling investments receive heavy public subsidies which may lead to

overinvestment, and (2) returns to schooling contain consumption benefits (skills) not

included in the calculation. Another relevant comparison concerns the trade-off between

training and labor niobth . Optimal allocation of human resources in the labor market
requires equal marginal rates of return in both activities. The image of the U.S. labor
market as one in which mobility is rampant and job training modest (in comparison with

Japan and Western Europe) does not necessarily imply that the marginal rates are far out
of line. The picture is suggestive, but better data and deeper studies are needed.
A second objective of this paper was to estimate total annual costs of job training in

the economy. Three entirely different methods were used to estimate these volumes for
1958, 1976, and 1987. (1) The "direct" method used information on time spent in training
and on wages. For 1976 investments so calculated amounted to 11.2% of Total Employee

Compensation, and about half of the costs of school education. (2) In the 'indirect" method
training costs were estimated from wage profiles, using a wage function fitted to 1976 PSID

data. The indirect estimate provides an upper limit since other factors, job mobility among

21
them..

affect the slope of the wage profile. Indeed, the dit esdma n 1976 was

about two/thirds of the indirect estimate, and close to 80% of it, once gains due to labor
mobility are netted out of the wage growth in the profile. (3) A third method uses
information on costs of formal training programs and on average time spent in them, and

inflates the figures to a total training level. Rather remarkably, the three estimates are not
far apart. Of course, the estimate based on wage profiles represents an upper limit.
The estimates suggest a slower growth of training than of school expenditures

between 1958 and 1976. Substitution of schooling for job training may have been

responsible for the development.
The finding that directly observed training costs account for a large part of the wage

profile represents strong support for the human capital interpretation of wage profiles. It
also permits a time series analysis of job training, based on annually available profiles.
