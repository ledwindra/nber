Household Migration, Urban Growth,
and Industrialization:
the United States, 1850—1860

AB STRACT

This paper utilizes a national sample of nearly 1,600 households
linked in the census manuscript schedules to investigate causes and
consequences of migration to urban areas during the midst of America's
industrial revolution. Although record linkage was limited to the subset of
households that had at least one child in 1850, the data are relatively rich
in socioeconomic information. A regional analysis of migration and
occupational change shows that while established households were generally
mobile, they were extraordinarily reluctant to commit labor to urban—
industrial pursuits. The evidence suggests that the presence of children,
retraining costs, lack of control over fertility, risk aversion, and an
unfavorable view of urban areas by rural residents contributed to their
avoidance of cities and towns. The findings also contribute to debates over
the compression of the wage structure and the extent of socioeconomic
mobility.

Urbanization was unquestionably important for the economic, social,
political, and demographic development of the United States during the 19th

century. The rise of production and distribution centers, the supply of
labor and its geographic distribution, the emergence of labor unions, the
operations of urban political machines, and the public health movement are
examples of familiar themes associated with urbanization in American

history. The importance of migration to urban growth is also indisputable.
Because birth rates were low but death rates were high, migration fueled

urban growth during the 19th century. Indeed, many cities and towns would
have declined in size without an inflow of people that replaced the excess
of deaths over births.

Study of migration and urban growth has been hampered by lack of

suitable data. Systematic registration of births and deaths was scanty
before the end of the 19th century and, unlike some European countries, the

United States never had a system of migration registration. Instead,
scholars have utilized various data collected for other purposes. For
example, a measure of migration called the persistence ratio has been widely
calculated by tracking names through manuscript schedules, city directories,

and other sources. Though popular for its modest data collection
requirements, this measure incorporates amounts of mortality and
underenumeration that are usually uncertain and is silent on where people

went or what happend to them after moving. Moreover, efficiency in data
collection and availability of records have directed efforts toward studies

of particular urban areas, often large cities. Though highly valuable, as a
group these local studies frequently involve diverse data sources, different

time periods, and contrasting methodologies, all of which complicate

comparisons of results. From the ingredients of local studies and the

2

emphasis on cities at the expense of towns and villages it has been

difficult to weave a coherent and complete picture of urbanization. A
national study that included towns and villages as well as cities would help
to unify research on urban development.

This paper utilizes a national sample of nearly 1,600 households
linked in the census manuscript schedules to investigate causes and
consequences of migration to urban areas during the midst of America's

industrial revolution. Although record linkage was limited to the subset of
households that had at least one child in 1850, the data are relatively rich

in socioeconomic information. A regional analysis of migration and
occupational change shows that while established households were generally
mobile, they were extraordinarily reluctant to commit labor to urban—

industrial pursuits. The evidence suggests that the presence of children,
retraining costs, lack of control over fertility, risk aversion, and an
unfavorable view of urban areas by rural residents contributed to their

avoidance of cities and towns. The findings also contribute to debates over
the compression of the wage structure and the extent of socioeconomic
mobility.

I. REGIONAL PATTERNS OF URBANIZATION
Although the United States as a whole urbanized rapidly during the
mid 19th century and a major branch of the development literature stems from
rural—urban two—sector models, evidence on regional patterns of urbanization
and information on regional patterns of specialization and development
suggest that a regional approach to rural—urban migration would be

productive for the United States. Statistical tests on household migration
patterns, reported in later sections of the paper, confirm that a regional

3

approach is appropriate. Data reported in Table 1 convey the overall
picture and the regional contrasts. The proportion of the population living
in urban areas, defined as incorporated places of 2,500 or more residents,
increased more than five fold, rising from slightly over 6 percent early in

the century to nearly 40 percent by 1900. The annual rate of growth of
population in urban areas peaked at 6.5 percent during the decade of the

1840s but was also high (5.6 percent) during the 1850s. The regional
pictures were quite different, however. The share of population living in
urban areas exceeded 18 percent in the Northeast by 1840 but this level was

not exceeded in the North Central states until 1870 and in the South until

1900. The demographic evidence on the regional pace of urbanization accords
well with regional patterns of industrial development. The South was dotted
with commercial towns and also had a few small cities but remained devoted

to agriculture throughout the century. The process of industrialization
undoubtably began in the Northeast, perhaps within a decade or two following
the War of 1812 but surely by the 1840s, depending on one's definition and

emphasis. Mercantile towns were generally numerous in the settled portion
of the North Central region by the 1830s while aspects of industrial
activity were clearly evident in that region by the 1850s.
High rates of urban growth characteristic of the early years of
settlement outside the Northeast are somewhat misleading as an overall guide

to change because the population base was small. The urban population
rapidly reached 16 percent of the total in the West before the Civil War,
for example, but less than 2 percent of the nation's population lived in

that region in 1860. Therefore the number of people who moved to urban
areas in the West was relatively unimportant for the national picture during

the antebellum period. For this reason and because there are few

4

observations in the sample for study of rural—urban movement in the West,
this region is omitted from the analysis of househould migration.

During the sample period of 1850 to 1860 one would expect to find
that rates of household migration to urban areas were highest in the

Northeast, followed by the North Central and the South regions. Moreover,
the Northeast should have been characterized by migration related to
industrial activity, the South by movement for commercial lines of
employment, and the North Central region by a hybrid of purposes.

II. A FRAMEWORK AND PERSPECTIVE
Although several frameworks for the study of migration have been
proposed during the past century, including Ravenstein's "laws," gravity
models, push and pull approaches, and explanations focusing on intervening
opportunities, economic motives are a prominent theme in migration research.
Broadly and properly interpreted, Larry Sjaastad's formulation of migration
as an investment encompasses and recasts what appear to be diverse

approaches to the subject.1 In Sjaastad's view, the money costs of the
investment include expenditures on food, lodging, and transportation, and
the nonmonetary costs include foregone earnings while traveling, searching

for and learning a new job. Psychic aspects include net losses from leaving
family, friends, and associates and also incorporate perceptions and

appraisals of the general environment at the place of origin relative to

potential destinations. Obviously the overall psychic price of a move could
be positive or negative. The returns include a positive or negative
increment to a real earnings stream attributable.to a change in earnings; a

5

change in the costs of employment; or a change in the prices paid by or
received by the migrant.

Variables that may influence the costs and returns and the rate of
return on the investment include:2

(1) Age. Excluding retirement

migration, the probability of movement ordinarily declines after the late
teens and early twenties in part because the horizon over which returns are

realized from migration declines with age. It has also been argued that the
transactions costs of moving, psychic costs and possibly risk aversion may

rise with age; (2) Education. Awareness of and response to economic
opportunities elsewhere and ability to adapt to a new environment rises with

education; (3) Wealth. The ability to finance a move rises with wealth, but
the transactions costs of moving may also rise with wealth so the net effect

of this variable is unclear; (4) Family status. A spouse and children add
to the cost of a move, but it is possible that higher eanings for the
spouse and children of working age could more than offset the higher costs;

(5) Occupation. Highly skilled and specialized occupations tend to have
thin markets, which may increase the costs of finding employment elsewhere.
Higher migration rates may be associated with declining or emerging

occupations; (6) Ethnicity. The foreign—born and particularly recent
immigrants may have had fewer or less effective channels to acquire
information about employment opportunities than native—born and may have

spent more time searching, via migration, for employment. Alternatively,
the number of communities of the same ethnic background but in different
localities that existed to facilitate adjustments to migration may have been
smaller for the foreign compared with the native—born.

6

Georgaphic patterns of wages are obviously relevant for migration

decisions but unfortunately the available information is scanty. Evidence
on the daily wages of common labor across states, examined by Stanley

Lebergott, suggests that migrants responded to wage incentives and that
regional differentials narrowed during the 19th century, pointing to the
creation of a national labor market.3 Reliable data on wage differrentials

for a variety of occupations by areas as small as counties are simply
unavailable, and thus wages cannot be incorporated formally into the

statistical analysis. Instead, migration flows will be used to shed light
on wage patterns.

European immigration, particularily from Ireland and Germany, was
important to American population growth by the middle of the century and

since many foreign—born located in urban areas, any analysis of rural—urban
migration should recognize the impact of this group on urban labor markets.
In this regard, the occupations and geographic patterns of settlement of the
immigrants will be incorporated into the discussion.

Before considering determinants of migration, it is useful to

discuss the overall plausibility of results from the household data. The
extent of movement is an important dimension in this regard. In the sample
of 1,581 households that were matched, 498 or 31.5 percent of those found in
1850 resided in a different county in 1860, which implies a level of

persistence of 68.5 percent. Although studies have reported persistence
rates as low as 20 to 30 percent among some population groups over a 10 year
period during the nineteenth century, Donald Parkerson and David Galenson
and Daniel Levy remind us that persistence measures embody downward biases
of mortality and underenumeration that may amount to 20 to 30 percentage

7

points

or more.4 Moreover, single individuals and young couples without

children generally had higher rates of mobility than established families.

Thus, the implied persistence rate of 68.5 percent falls within a plausible
range and suggests that the households in the sample were neither unusually
mobile or immobile given their socioeconomic characteristics.

Patterns of rural to rural migration are a useful backdrop against

which to study rural to urban movement. Table 2 presents the results of a
logistic regression that explains rural to rural migration from 1850 to

1860.

5

.

The dependent variable is dichotomous and takes a value of 1 if

the

household resided in a different county in 1860 compared with 1850 and is 0

otherwise. The data base includes only those households that resided in a
rural area in both censuses and the explanatory variables refer to values

taken in 1850. Although the direction of effect of an independent variable
on the dependent variable is the same as the sign of its coefficient,

because the estimated relationship is nonlinear the practical significance
of a variable may be difficult to discern from the magnitude of a

coefficient. Therefore, a variable's impact will be assessed by evaluating
other independent variables at their sample means and converting the

information into expected probabilities. As anticipated, the chances of
migration declined systematically with age and with wealth (value of real

estate). The expected probability of migration fell from 36.8 percent at
age 25 to 23.0 percent at age 50 while it was 32.5 percent among households
with $100 of real estate, 21.8 percent at $5,000, and only 13.8 percent at

io,ooo.6 The probabilities of movement were not significantly different
among the foreign—born compared with native—born whites. Nor were free
blacks less mobile than native-born whites; one might have hypothesized that

registration requirements and other impediments would have acted to reduce

the movements of free blacks. Though negative as expected, the coefficient
on illiteracy was not statistically significant.

Children may have

increased the costs of migration, but apparently the expected returns to
their migration were such that no net systematic effect prevailed on the

probability of household migration. Among occupational groups, only blue
collar workers (expected probability equalled 37.0 percent) were
systematically more mobile than farmers and other occupations (expected

probability equalled 28.7 percent).7 The chances of movement differed
substantially across regions, taking on values of 15.7 percent in the
Northeast, 43.4 percent in the North Central, 33.7 percent in the South, and

28.1 percent in the Vest. About 45.1 percent of these households resided
less than 100 miles from their place of origin in 1850.8 Rural to rural
mobility was understandably low in the Northeast because most sites suitable

for farming were already taken by 1850 and many of those who were interested

in expanding farm operations had left the region by that date. The
probability of movement was about 10 percentage points lower in the South
compared with the North Central states, which contradicts, or at least does

not support, claims that antebellum southern farmers were notorious for
exhausting the soil and moving to new lands.

The technique of comparing expected probabilities by changing the
value of one variable while holding others constant is useful for appraising
practical significance, but it obscures the diversity within the sample.
The wide range of expenience is made clear by changing the values of several

variables. For example, among native—born, literate whites the chances of
movement were 62.1 percent for a 25 year old, blue collar worker who had

9

$100 in real estate and resided in the North Central region, whereas it was
only 7.5 percent for a 50 year old farmer who had $5,000 in real estate and
resided in the Northeast.

Although the 1950 census defined an urban area as an incorporated
place of 2,500 or more residents, there are several reasonable definitions

of the term "urban." Because the major structural change in the 19th
century was the transition from agriculture to industry, however, it is

appropriate to focus on the exodus from agriculture. The existence of small
manufacturing operations in what would be called "rural" areas by the 1950
census definition also suggests that a broad definition of "urban" is
reasonable for study of change during the era of industrialization.

Accordingly, "urban" is defined in this paper as a village, town, or city of
any size that was enumerated by the census and rural to urban migration is
defined as movement from a rural area to an urban area of any size.
The focus on the decline of agriculture is legitimate but obscures

the interesting phenomenon of movement within urban areas. Which urban
areas grew most rapidly? To what extent was there increasing concentration

of populaton in major cities? Did small towns and villages act as feeders
for larger urban areas? Though not the focus of analysis in this paper,
Table 3 gives some perspective on these questions and on the definition of

rural to urban migration. The first row of the table shows that those who
no longer resided in rural areas after 1850 tended to avoid large cities;
about 42 percent went to villages (under 2,500) while only 11 percent went

to places of 25,000 or more. Though qualified by the fact of small sample
sizes, the available evidence supports the hypothesis of upward movement to
larger urban areas; over one—half of those who resided in an urban area of
less than 2,500, for example, resided in a larger urban place in 1860.

The

10

feeder pattern occurred in striking contrast to reverse migration; virtually
all of those who did not move up or remain within the same category moved to

a rural area. Almost without exception the smaller cities and towns were
not repositories for those who departed from larger urban areas.

The finding that 43 percent of those who resided in urban areas in
1850 resided in rural areas in 1860 appears to be consistent with Frederick
Jackson Turner's hypothesis that the frontier acted as a safety—valve for

urban labor. However, none of those who left eastern urban areas moved to
the frontier.9

Rural areas may have been an outlet for urban labor but

the frontier was tangential to the process, at least for established
households during the time period from 1850 to 1860.

III. RURAL TO URBAN MIGRATION
Of the 1,429 households residing in rural areas in 1850, 6.9

percent resided in urban areas in 1860. Though rural to urban migration
rates were low throughout the sample, the extent of movement differed by

region, varying from 9.2 percent in the Northeast, to 6.0 percent in the

North Central, and 6.9 percent in the South)°
Of those who moved from a rural to an urban area, only 30.3 percent
departed from their county of residence in 1850 and of these 63.0 percent

traveled less than 100 miles. The importance of local migration to
urbanization during the decade of the 1850s contrasts with a later era. By
1940 and 1950 the majority of migrants to urban areas probably originated

outside the state)1
Data reported in Table 4 explain rural to urban movement in terms

characteristics of the household head. In this and other logistic

11

regressions in the paper, the dependent variable is dichotomous and takes

a value of 1 if the household moved. The strong negative association of age
and wealth observed for movement from rural to rural areas is absent from

the rural to urban movers. Indeed, the table shows that five out of six
coefficients on these variables were positive. As expected, children
impeded movement to urban areas; all six coefficients on the chilren's
variables were negative, however only two were statistically significant.
Although it is well—known that the foreign—born populated cities, their

migration behavior from rural areas was not systematically different from

that of the native-born.'2 Cities, towns, and villages throughout the
country systematically absorbed white collar and blue collar workers from

rural areas, but the rate of flow was greatest in the Northeast. In that
region the expected probability of migration to an urban area was 1.6
percent for farmers and other occupations but 21.3 percent for white collar

workers and 16.9 percent for blue collar workers. In the South the chances
were 4.5 percent for farmers and other occupations, 17.3 percent for white

collar workers and 10.4 percent for blue collar workers. The behavior of
unskilled workers was not systematically different from farmers and other
occupations in any region.

IV. URBAN TO RURAL MIGRATION
Of the 148 households that resided in an urban area in 1850, 63
households or 42.6 percent resided in a rural area in 1860.13

Though high

compared with the rate of 6.9 percent noted for rural to urban migration,

the base for the reverse flow was small. Since 99 of 1,429 households moved

12

from rural to urban areas, there was a small net gain of established
households in urban areas.

Table 5 depicts the results of logistic regression explaining urban
to rural migration.14

As was the case for rural to urban migraton, but

unlike rural to rural migration, age and wealth had no systematic influence

on urban to rural movement. The evidence on numbers of children and

persistence in urban areas was mixed: only four out of six coefficients on
the number of children were positive and only the one for children under 10

in the North Central states was statistically significant. The systematic
retention of the foreign—born accords with perceptions of cities as
concentration points for emigrants from Europe; in the Northeast, for
example, the chances of outflow were 61.6 percent among native—born but only

5.6 percent among the foreign—born. With the exception of the Northeast
there was no systematic retention according to city size. In that region
the chances of outflow decreased from 77.1 percent for areas under 25,000 to
25.6 percent for cities of 25,000 but under 75,000, to 12.7 percent for

cities of 75,000 and above. White collar and blue collar workers tended to
persist in urban areas (all coefficients on these variables were negative),
but with the exception of blue collar workers in urban areas of the South
there were no statistically significant patterns of departure by occupation.

V. MIGRATION AND OCCUPATIONAL CHANGE
The extent to which 19th century America approached an egalitarian
society has been an enduring source of animated debate.15 One aspect of the
controversy concerns the relationship between geographic mobility and social

and economic mobility. Some insights into the issues are available from

13

data reported in Table 6. The table arranges the occupations reported in
1850 and 1860 of those who moved to or from urban areas and of those who
persisted into a matrix of categories used in the analysis of migration

(unskilled, farmer, blue collar, white collar, and other). Because the
total number of observations is reasonably small, the meaning of

"occupation" as listed by census enumerators is sometimes ambiguous, and the
choice of occupational groupings is partly arbitrary, conclusions suggested
by these data are necessarily tenative.'6 Given these qualifications, the
results are consistent with the hypothesis that upward mobility accompanied

movement to urban areas. About 13.0 percent of the stationary households
moved upward while 21.7 percent of those who moved to an urban area rose in

occupational classification.17 Unfortunately the number of unskilled who
moved to urban areas was very small and cannot be studied separately.

However, it is notable that among those unskilled (essentially laborers) who
did not migrate, 39 percent became farmers and about 23 percent became blue

collar or white collar workers. Recalling that all of the unskilled were
heads of established families in 1850, the finding that nearly two—thirds
improved their position suggests that upward mobility in American society
was not a process confined to the acquisition of skills or wealth in advance
of family formation.

One half of those who were farmers in 1850 and who moved to urban
areas continued to list farming as their occupation, while the other half
were distributed among unskilled (13 percent), blue collar (16 percent),

white collar (16 percent), and other occupations (6 percent). The farmers
of urban residence presumably raised food for export to the city or town by

14

working near the outskirts of the urban area and, in addition, they may have
engaged in nonagricultural pursuits on a part-time basis.

It is not surprising that the farmers who left urban areas usually

remained devoted to farming. However, there was greater occupational shift
among blue and white collar categories when moving away compared with

movement into urban areas. About 43 percent of the former residents of
urban areas who were blue collar workers switched to farming while about
half as many (23 percent) of the white collar workers made this transition.
High rates of outflow from urban to rural areas, the extent of the shift to
farming among those who left urban areas, and the lack of mobility from
larger to smaller urban areas (noted in connection with the discussion of

Table 3) suggest that some of those who moved to urban areas may have had
the intention of accumulating a grubstake for use in agriculture.

VI. IMPLICATIONS
There is widespread agreement that the United States was in the
midst of industrialization during the 10 years after 1850, yet the package
of evidence on the migration behavior of established households during this
decade demonstrates the considerable reluctance of this group to commit

labor to urban—industrial pursuits.18 Evidence on the migration behavior of
households in the sample, given in the last row of Table 7, shows that
established households in rural areas declined by only 2.6 percent.

Although urban households increased by 24.7 percent, total population in
urban areas increased by 73.2 percent, which implies that the share of
established households in the total population of urban areas declined

during the decade from 1850 to 1860. While it is too strong to characterize

15

their behavior as an obstacle to industrialization, the supply of urban—
industrial labor, and presumably the rate of industrialization, was less
than it would have been had established households been more than modestly

involved in urban labor force growth. Industrial expansion in urban areas
was forced to cope with minor participation by a group that dominated the
total labor force.

Why did established households add so little to labor force growth

in urban areas? The answer cannot be found in a general reluctance to move:
Over a 10 year period about 31.5 percent of all households in the sample

resided in a different county. This rate of mobility is several times
higher than the rural to urban rate of 6.9 percent, a pace which understates
the actual contrast because over two—thirds of the moves in this measure

occurred within the county of origin. Admittedly the rate of movement to
urban areas was higher in the Northeast (9.2 percent) where
industrialization was concentrated, but the conclusion that participation
was small also holds for that region.

Instead, the search for an answer should begin in terms of the

economic model that views migration as an Investment. Their behavior
suggests that established households did not perceive the financial and
psychic package associated with movement to an urban area as a good

investment. Exactly which components in the package weighed heavily in the
decision—making process of established households is unclear, but the
regressions and information on regional rates of growth suggest some

insights into their priorities. One consideration is the presence of

children. Data in Table 4 make clear that children, especially those below
age 10, impaired rural to urban migration while information in Table 5 shows

that young children tended to induce an outflow from urban areas. This

16

result can be interpreted in terms of the financial outlays and opportunity
costs of caring for children in relation to their contribution to household

income and services. Children were relatively costly in urban areas on this
score.

A strong negative relationship between age of the household head and

the chances of rural to rural migration was noted earlier. Yet, age did not

systematically influence rural-urban migration: households headed by older
men were about as likely to move to urban areas as those headed by younger

men. Why were mobile households headed by older men relatively more likely
to move to urban areas? One hypothesis consistent with this behavior is
that migrants to urban areas were failures at agriculture or at other

occupations characteristic of rural areas. Since the judgement of failure
was reached after a period of experimentation, trial, and error, the
migrants to urban areas were naturally older.

Opposed to this line of

thought is the finding that wealth, as measured by value of real estate, had
no systematic influence on the chances of moving to urban areas.

While it

is possible that some migrants to urban areas were financial failures, the

group included successful individuals as well. A different approach to the
question highlights the costs and benefits of children in urban versus rural
areas and therefore the importance of control over fertility as an

ingredient in the decision to migrate. Although there is some evidence that
family limitation may have been practiced in parts of the United States by
the mid 19th century, the extent of the practice, and especially its

effectiveness is questionable.19 It is likely that most couples who might
have contemplated a move to an urban area could not have controlled family

size reliably. Under these circumstances some families may have delayed a

17

move until the biological clock either assured that additional children were
not forthcoming or had significantly reduced the chances of conception.
Preferences expressed by rural—urban migrants for continuing a given

line of work may also be understood within the investment framework. In
addition to the costs of moving, changing occupations to a line of work
suitable for urban areas may have required outlays and foregone earnings for
retraining that were not feasible or possible for many prospective migrants.
Risks of earnings loss could be added to the liabilities of moving to an

urban area. Cities were unhealthy places of residence during the mid 19th
century and the possibility of incapacitation through illness and poor
health was probably greater for recent migrants.2°

Households that had

incurred commitments for the care of children would have been understandably
risk averse, and so retraining costs and the possibility of poor health

could have weighed heavily in decisions to avoid urban areas. The finding
that rural residents who were white collar or blue collar workers were more
likely than farmers to move to urban areas is consistent with an important

role for retraining costs and risk aversion. In this context, the
acquisition of skills marketable in urban areas while living in rural areas
may have been an important first step in the use of labor from established
households in urban areas.

Table 7 shows that established households increased at a rate
substantially below total population growth in urban areas of the Northeast
and the North Central states while the rate actually exceeded total

population growth in urban areas of the South. The rate of outflow from
rural areas was also relatively high in the South. Why did the composition
of migration to urban areas of the South include relatively more established

18

households? A complete answer to this question would require information on
expected earnings and living costs by household type and region in rural and

urban areas. While it is conceivable that considerations of cost and
earnings alone could explain these migration patterns, the differences in
migration were so large relative to likely differences in earnings and costs

that other factors were probably involved. Perceptions of cities and the
urban way of life in the mind of rural residents may have been among the

other factors. The late antebellum period witnessed a moral crusade that
intertwined themes of anti—slavery, temperance, and Christian principles of

clean living. Evangelical Protestants were particularily effective in

promoting the movement. Reinforced by anti-Papal sentiments, many northern
rural Protestants saw their cities as dens of iniquity that were inhabited
by foreigners, many of whom were Roman Catholics, and given to places of

drinking, gambling, and vice. In this view cities would have been
undesirable places for raising a family, regardless of the number of

children. Rural southerners were also suspicious of the social and moral
climate of cities but avoidance of urban areas may have been greater among
northerners because their cities were larger and more likely to have been
inhabited by foreigners and Catholics and because the antislavery campaign

in that region strengthened the moral crusade. Although the Protestant
ethic has been cited as promoting the development of capitalism, the ethic
of Protestants may have inhibited the creation of an urban labor force
during America's industrial revolution.

The distribution of income and related patterns of real wages during
the 19th century have been a lively topic of research in recent years.

Jeffrey Williamson and Peter Lindert have argued that inequality of wealth
and income increased in the United States after 1820 through a process of

19

wage "stretching." Although an increase in the ratio of skilled to
unskilled wages could have been caused by relatively rapid increases in the
supply of unskilled labor associated with European immigration, which was

particularily heavy from the mid 1840s through the mid 1850s, their general
equilibrium analysis attributes the widening gap principally to different

growth rates in the demand for labor. Specifically, they argue that capital
accumulation and mechanization displaced the unskilled but favored skilled

labor, which was need as a complement ot machinery. Others have debated the
21

conceptual and the empirical basis of their claims.

The migration

patterns discussed in this paper furnish indirect evidence on the
controversy over whether the skilled wage premium increased.

The phenomenon

of "stretching" the wage structure required relatively inelastic supplies of
skilled labor; the finding that established households were reluctant to

move to urban areas is consistent with this requirement. The fundamental
issue, however, is changes in demand relative to supply. If the rewards to
skilled labor were increasing relative to unskilled labor in urban areas,
then one would expect to observe higher rates of migration to urban areas by
skilled compared with unskilled labor; this pattern of migration existed
throughout the country and was particularily strong in the Northeast.

In

that region the chances of migration were insignificantly different for
unskilled workers versus farmers and other occupations while the probability
of movement was 1.6 percent for farmers and other occupations but 21.3
percent for white collar workers and 16.9 percent for blue collar workers.

VII. CONCLUDING REMARKS

20

Because migrants to urban areas during the 19th century were often
unattached young adults, one may question the contribution of research on
established households to the overall picture of urbanization.22 Even

though their patterns of migration were not studied, by implication and
extension this research sheds light on aspects of young adult behavior.
That larger numbers of children impeded movement to urban areas, for
example, is consistent with the high rates of movement observed among the

young and unattached. Assuming that responses to Incentives were similar,
or at least not perverse, rates of movement among the unattached, though
higher in general, should have followed patterns broadly characteristic of

established households. One would expect, regardless of family attachment,
that rates of movement to urban areas were relatively higher among white
collar and blue collar workers, and rates of urban persistence were
relatively higher among the foreign-born and among those who resided in
larger cities of the Northeast.

21

APPENDIX: THE DATA
A sample of households linked in the 1850 and 1860 census
manuscripts was prepared to study urbanization, spatial patterns of
mobility, and the selectivity of movement and their relationship to the

functioning of labor makets and economic growth.23 To help address diverse
issues, the total sample consisted of parts selected according to criteria

of area and population. The number of counties selected per state was
proportional to the relative population of the state among all states in the
area sample, while in the population sample it was proportional to the

relative population of the state among all states. Ten households were
selected at random from each county and at least one county was selected

from each state for each sample. Households were sought from a total of 300
counties, of which 150 were allocated to each type of sample. All the
information from the manuscript schedules was coded for 2,861 households.

The total number falls short of 3,000 because the schedules for some
counties did not exist, were not legible, or had less than 10 families
meeting the criteria discussed below.

The approach to matching exploited the indexes of household heads

that exist for each state enumerated in the 1850 census. These indexes,
which were prepared by Accelerated Indexing Systems of Salt Lake City, are
arranged alphabetically by last name and include the county of residence and
the page number where the family was recorded in the manuscript schedules.

However, many individuals could have had the same name, approximately the
same age, and the same state of birth, and so additional restrictions were
imposed on the selection of families from the 1860 census to assure

identification in 1850. All households were sought in the same county and,

22

providing there were no more than 10 heads with the same name in the state,
within the same state of residence as located in 1860, but it simply was not
feasible to trace those not found in this way among the indexes for all

states. Instead, those families selected from the 1860 schedules were
required to have a child at least 10 years old. The reported state of birth
of the youngest child greater than or equal to 10 acted as a pointer to the
state where the family was likely to be found in 1850.

Of course, not all families were located by these methods. Of the
2,861 recorded from the 1860 census, 180 or 6.3 percent were not sought for
reasons of a common name, and 59 percent of the remainder were found. In
appraising these results it is important to distinguish losses that occurred
through the equivalent of a random process (not systematically related to

migration) from those that were attributable to the object of investigation

(migration). Random losses merely increased the costs of data collection

while losses attributable to migration could bias results. The incidence of
common names was not systematically related to known determinants of
migration such as wealth, age, and occupation.24 About 25 to 30 percent,

and concieveably more, of the 41 percent not found were unavoidable losses

attributable to underenumeration in the 1850 census. Errors of omission and
transcription in the census indexes and reporting errors in the 1860 census,

which were arguably unrelated to migration, may have been the source of 60

to 70 percent of the matching failures. Approximately 31.5 percent of those
matched in 1850 lived in a different county in 1860, and thus it seems
likely that only a small share of potentially observable intercounty moves
were lost through the matching procedure.

Galenson and Daniel S. Levy, "A Note on Biases in the Measurement of
Geographic Persistence Rates," Historical Methods, 19 (Fall 1986), pp. 171—

5. Based on a likelihood—ratio test, the determinants of rural to rural
migration were systematically different from those for rural to urban

migration at 0.005. The logit model and methodology of testing are
discussed in Gregory C. Chow, Econometrics (New York, 1983), pp. 255—263.

Additional analysis of rural to rural migration will be reported in
subsequent work.

6. The value of -2 log X shown at the bottom of the table, and in other
tables of the paper, is a measure of the significance of the regression

relationship. The term X is the likelihood ratio and equals the value of
the likelihood function obtained when all parameter values are set equal to
zero divided by the value of the likelihood function obtained under the

31

maintained hypothesis. The variable —2 log X has a chi—square distribution
with as many degrees of freedom as parameter values set equal to zero, which
is 13 in the case of Table 2.

Many migration studies have found that migration rates are nonlinear as

a function of age. The chances of movement rise from low rates at ages in
the teens, reach a peak in the mid—twenties, and then fall more or less

regularily at the older ages. See, for example, Hope T. Eldridge and
Dorothy Swain Thomas, Population Redistribution and Economic Growth, United
States, 1870—1950, Vol. 3, Demographic Analyses and Interrelations

(Philadelphia, 1964), pp. 132—138. Given this pattern, one could argue that
a squared term in age should be included among the regressors. However, the
the sample is composed overwhelmingly of household heads whose ages fell on

the declining portion of the age—migration relationship. Only 3.5 percent
of the heads were below age 25 in 1850. Moreover, age and age—squared are
jointly insignificant if included in this equation and are usually

insignificant in other equations involving age reported in the paper. The
exception involves urban to rural migration in the North Central states; in
that instance the chances of movement reached a minimum at age 37.3.
7. The definitions of occupational groups follow those outlined in appendix

B of Stephan Thernstrom, The Other Bostonians. (Cambridge, 1973). Given
the imprecision of occupational listings by the census and the debate over
what constitutes appropriate groupings, the results give only a general

impression of migration flows by occupational categories. In 1850 the white
collar workers consisted primarily of clergyman (3.0%), clerks (5.5%),
doctors and physicians (9.7%), grocers (2.5%), innkeepers (2.1%), lawyers

and attorneys (7.2%), lumber merchants (2.1%), manufacturers (3.0%),
merchants (22.4%), overseers (4.2%), teachers (3.4%), and traders (2.1%).

32

The blue collar workers were composed largely of blacksmiths (8.2%),
bricklayers and masons (4.2%), butchers (2.3%), cabinet makers (3.3%),
carpenters (18.6%), coopers (4.2%), millers (3.3%), shoemakers (10.1%),

tailors (4.2%), wagon makers (3.6%), and wheelwrights (2.3%). Laborers
(89.1%) dominated the unskilled.

8. Distances were measured from centroids of population in each county.
9. Of 124 households that resided in urban areas of the East (defined as
east of the 90th meridian, which is a few miles east of St. Louis), none
moved to rural areas of the West (defined as west of the 90th meridian).
Changing the definition of region to the 88th or the 92nd meridian has no
effect on the results.

10. In this discussion region is defined by place of residence in 1860.
The regional comparisons should be viewed cautiously because methods of

enumerating town and village populations may have varied. The published
census for New England, for example, tended to report separately only the

larger urban areas. The measure of rural to urban migration may therefore
understate the actual extent of movement in the Northeast compared with

other regions. Townships that had populations in excess of 10,000 residents

were arbitrarily counted as urban areas. Even if all concentrations of
population corresponding to towns and villages of size less than 10,000 were
not distinguished from truly rural areas in the New England census, however,
the measured extent of rural to urban migration by established households in
the Northeast (9.2 percent) is remarkably small compared with the extent of
urban growth, however defined, in the region.

Likelihood—ratio tests indicate that determinants of migration differed

systematically across regions. The regression relationships were

33

significantly different at 0.05 (Northeast versus North Central), 0.20
(Northeast versus South), and 0.15 (North Central versus South).

11. Eldridge and Thomas, Population Redistribution, p. 210.
12. Unfortunately, there are insufficient observations to distinguish among

country of birth for the foreign—born. Similarily, observations are lacking
to investigate the behavior of blacks and the illiterate by region.

However, if the regions are combined in a single analysis, the probability
of migration to urban areas was systematically higher for blacks compared

with whites. The finding of higher mobility for blacks reinforces the
point on the mobility of this group made in the section on rural to rural
migration.

13. These figures pertain to the Northeast, North Central, and South only.
High rates of outmigration, which have been documented for specific urban

areas in the United States, also characterized European cities in the 19th

century. See Peter R. Knights, The Plain People of Boston, 1830—1860: A
Study in City Growth (New York, 1971), pp. 103—104; Paul M. Hohenberg and
Lynn Hollen Lees, The Making of Urban Europe, 1000—1950 (Cambridge, 1985),
p. 255.

14. Likelihood-ratio tests indicate that determinants of urban to rural

migration differed systematically by region. The regression relationships
were significantly different at 0.10 (Northeast versus north Central), 0.025

(Northeast versus South), and 0.08 (North Central versus South). In
addition, within each region the regression relationships determining rural
to urban versus urban to rural migration were significantly different at
0.005.

15. The controversy is illustrated by the debate over the "egalitarian

myth." See Robert E. Galiman, "Professor Pessen on the "Egalitarian Myth,'"

34

Social Science History 2(Win. 1978), PP. 194—207; Edward Pessen, "On a

Recent Cliometric Attempt to Resurrect the Myth of Antebellum
Egalitarianism," Social Science History 3 (Win. 1979), PP. 208—227. The

debate extends beyond social and occupational mobility and incorporates the

distribution of wealth. The matched sample of households includes
information on wealth (measured by value of real estate) but my analysis of
these data will be reported in another paper.
16. A critique of the debate over occupational classification and social
mobility is available in Patrick M. Horan, "Occupational Mobility and
Historical Social Structure," Social Science History 9 (Win. 1985), pp. 25—
47.

17. Upward is defined as movement from unskilled to farmer, blue collar, or

white collar; farmer to blue collar or white collar; and blue collar to

white collar. The percentages are significantly different at 0.10.
18. This pattern has been observed in other countries. Young, single adults
also comprised the majority of newcomers to European cities in the 19th

century. However, there were instances of widespread movement of families
to cities in Ireland and Germany. See Hohenberg and Lees, The Making of
Modern Europe, pp. 255-56.
