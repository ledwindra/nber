ABSTRACT
We develop a model of pandemic risk management and rm valuation. We introduce aggregate
transmission shocks into an epidemic model and link valuations to infections via an asset-pricing
framework with vaccines. Infections lower earnings growth but firms can mitigate damages. We
estimate a large reproduction number R0 and transmission volatility for COVID-19. Using these
estimates, we assess the accuracy of deterministic approximations based on R0. Our model
generates predictions consistent with data: unexpected infection resurgence, non-monotonic
mitigation policies, and higher price-to-earnings ratios during a pandemic. Valuations would be
significantly lower absent mitigation and a high vaccine arrival rate.

Abstract
We develop a model of pandemic risk management and firm valuation. We introduce
aggregate transmission shocks into an epidemic model and link valuations to infections via an asset-pricing framework with vaccines. Infections lower earnings growth
but firms can mitigate damages. We estimate a large reproduction number R0 and
transmission volatility for COVID-19. Using these estimates, we assess the accuracy
of deterministic approximations based on R0 . Our model generates predictions consistent with data: unexpected infection resurgence, non-monotonic mitigation policies,
and higher price-to-earnings ratios during a pandemic. Valuations would be significantly lower absent mitigation and a high vaccine arrival rate.

Introduction

Deterministic epidemic models play a valuable role in the study of COVID-19 and its impact
on the economy. On the public health front, epidemiologists recommend lockdown measures
to keep R0 , defined as the expected number of secondary infections generated by a single
(representative) infected individual in a fully susceptible population, below one (see, e.g.,
Ferguson et al. (2020)). On the economic front, economists model trade-offs of mitigation, where agents assume infection dynamics are deterministic (see, e.g., Atkeson (2020),
Gourinchas (2020)).
Yet, both epidemiologists and economists recognize deterministic models are potentially
crude approximations of stochastic epidemic dynamics. Aggregate transmission rate shocks
due to environmental factors can play a large role in the evolution of infection dynamics (see
Andersson and Britton (2012)). A case in point is the resurgence of COVID-19 in a number
of countries during the summer of 2020, including countries with prudent mitigation such as
South Korea. While epidemiologists recognize such stochasticity in fitting statistical models
(see, e.g., Kucharski et al. (2020), Li et al. (2020)), it would be valuable to explicitly model
how transmission volatility influence infection dynamics and optimal mitigation strategies.
This is especially important when one considers financial damage of the sort mentioned
by the Federal Reserve Board Financial Stability Report (2020): “Asset prices remain vulnerable to significant price declines should the pandemic take an unexpected course...” Indeed,
standard asset-pricing theory suggests that aggregate transmission shocks ought to play a
critical role in asset prices through a risk premium channel.
Towards this end, we start with an extension of a widely-used deterministic epidemic
model of COVID-19 (Kermack and McKendrick (1927)) featuring aggregate transmissionrate shocks that are intended to capture that viral contagiousness is unpredictable due to
environmental factors.1 Epidemic models of COVID-19 typically entertain multiple compartments in terms of tracking susceptible, infected, and resistant (including the recovered and
dead). In order to transparently highlight the importance of transmission volatility and for

tractability purposes, we focus on modeling just the infected population It , via a susceptibleinfected-susceptible (SIS) as opposed to a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) setting.2 For
a number of economic and financial applications, the focus is typically on horizons of many
years and the infected population is often the main state variable of interest since damages
are likely to increase with infections. There is also no consensus at this point that COVID-19
infection confers long-lasting immunity.
Following Gray et.al. (2011), who have used this approach for other viruses, we model
the COVID-19 aggregate transmission shocks via a stochastic transmission rate, βet . This
key input is modeled as a random variable with constant mean (predictable transmission
captured by parameter β) and transmission shocks (mean zero but with volatility captured
by parameter σ). The exit rate from the infected state back into the susceptible state
is assumed to be a constant γ. We further introduce a stochastic vaccine arrival into our
epidemic model as a jump with a Poisson arrival rate λ. When the vaccine arrives, we assume
the pandemic is over and infections go to zero. The resulting dynamics of the fraction of
infected then follows a four-parameter non-linear diffusion process.
We then model the financial impact of infection forecasts through the lens of a dynamic
asset-pricing model. The unexpected arrival of COVID-19 directly affect earnings through
three channels. First, there is a significant negative jump in earnings for firms in most
industries, except for a few such as technology (Landier and Thesmar (2020)). Second,
earnings growth is also potentially adversely affected by higher COVID-19 infections since
higher infection rates mean their workers are sick and less productive. Third, stochastic
transmission shocks also increase risk premia.
However, firms have access to a mitigation technology to reduce the drift of infections
by paying both (flow) fixed and variable costs. Taking the stochastic discount factor used
to price earnings as given, a representative firm optimally mitigates infections to reduce
the damage on valuation via earnings, while taking into account the arrival of a vaccine.
For instance, MarketWatch reported on May 2, 2020 that even a technology company like
2

This SIS setting is useful for modeling viruses where recovery does not grant long-lasting immunity,
which includes potentially many types of viruses.

Amazon will spend $4 billion or more on COVID-19 mitigation responses such as testing for
its workers, potentially wiping out the company’s Q2 profit.
Reducing the disease spread incurs costs and hence lowers earnings in the short term
but increases the expected earnings in the future by sufficient amounts so that it is optimal
for the firm even from a value-maximizing perspective. As a result, even absent any health
considerations, there are economic benefits to controlling COVID-19. Our model is a partialequilibrium one and ignores externalities associated with mitigation. Our focus is justified
by a number of studies including Andersen et.al. (2020) and Farboodi, Jarosch and Shimer
(2020) that point to the importance of voluntary mitigation in terms of social distancing
by households and firms even before government imposed lockdowns.3 Our model hence
links risk management and valuation to epidemic data (infections, mitigation, reproduction
numbers, transmission volatility, and vaccine arrival rate).
To relate our model to data, we first estimate our epidemic model by pooling COVID-19
case data from 16 countries (regions) that are at high risk during the period of January February of 2020. These countries had among the most air travel connections to the city of
Wuhan in China and have been the basis of the modeling of the early dynamics of COVID-19
before the onset of mitigation strategies. Given the noisiness and brief time series of the data
and our goal of demonstrating the influence of shocks, we fit one model for all 16 countries.
Our estimate of β is 6.62 per month, which translates to an infected individual infecting
one susceptible on average every five days (≈ 30/6.62.) Our estimate of monthly σ is 1.69,
which translates to a standard deviation of plus or minus 1.69 infected individuals per month.
The exit rate γ is equal to the inverse of the expected duration that an infected is sick and
infective; it is typically not estimated based on aggregate data early in epidemics since there
is a delay in when individuals leave the infected state. For our estimation of a population
average, we simply use 14 days as the duration to infer the exit rate γ at 1/(14 days), which
is 2.17 per month.4
3

Externalities are also modeled in the COVID-19 context in Eichenbaum, Rebelo and Trabant (2020) and
more generally for disasters in Hong, Wang and Yang (2020).
4
This estimate ranges from around 7 days to 14 days at the individual level but with a fat-tail in terms of
an infectious period across individuals. In empirical analysis, this parameter is typically assumed to follow

3

These estimates then imply that our (basic) reproduction number R0 using case data
from January-February is 3.05 and the 90% confidence interval (CI) is (1.12, 6.52) based on
the empirical distribution. Despite constraining one model for all countries (regions), our
estimates are in line with leading studies of COVID-19.5
Along with these estimates that characterize the pre-mitigation COVID-19 process, we
choose the remaining parameters to target asset-pricing moments and the magnitude of the
decline in current earnings, which is nearly 40% for the typical firm (see Landier and Thesmar
(2020)), and a post-mitigation reproduction number of around 1. We assume that the initial
jump in earnings comes about equally from customers, who stop consuming when COVID-19
arrives and will not return until a vaccine arrives, and optimal mitigation on the firm. Our
calibration assumes that the two channels contribute equally to the reduction transmission
rates. We set the vaccine arrival rate λ to one per year, so that the expected pandemic
duration is around one year based on surveys of vaccine experts and scientists.6
Our calibration generates a number of new insights. First, how well a deterministic
model’s infection forecasts approximates those of our stochastic model depends on vaccine
arrival. Deterministic model infection forecasts tend to overshoot our model’s conditional
forecasts. The reasoning is understood by mathematical epidemiologists that introducing
noise into the transmission process will lead to a dampening of stationary distribution of
infections (Andersson and Britton (2012) and Brauer, Driessche, and Wu (2008)). Even if
the reproduction number R0 > 1, the epidemic process might nonetheless die out due to the
uncertainty of transmissions as opposed to in the deterministic setting. The further out the
vaccine, the less good of an approximation is the deterministic model.
Second, our stochastic model yields rich optimal strategies beyond those from purely deterministic considerations. Because our estimated reproduction number is high, the optimal
strategy always involves incurring fixed costs over a large range of infections rates, starting
an Erlang distribution (Kucharski et al. (2020)).
5
Kucharsi et al. (2020) estimate a reproduction number of 2.35 [95% CI 1.15-4.77], while Imai et al.
(2020) estimate that it is 3.1 [95% CI 1.7-4.3].

save the world”.

at even a tiny fraction of the population being infected. However, transmission volatility
generates an option value of waiting reflected by the optimal mitigation policy in the infection rate It on the intensive margin. Optimal mitigation policy can hence be non-monotonic
in infection rates: initially increasing due to this option value of waiting and then declining
due to standard congestion effects, since as infections rise, less of the population will then be
susceptible. These implications match well with a standard epidemiological playbook that
we have observed as we discuss below.
Third, however, the infection process cannot be perfectly controlled due to aggregate
transmission shocks in contrast to deterministic models. Hence, mitigation at the intensive
margin can then fluctuate with infection rates. But the optimally-mitigated COVID-19
infection process will tend to be pulled toward a constant reproduction number over time.
These features match well the experience of a number of countries including the US that
had to deal with unexpected resurgence of COVID-19 in early March, followed by a period
where the reproduction number fell but then unexpectedly rose in the Summer of 2020.
Fourth, we show that the price-to-earnings (net of mitigation costs) can actually be higher
during a pandemic than in a normal period consistent with data assuming there is optimal
mitigation. The median annual price-to-earning ratio in the stock market has risen from
around 19 before the pandemic to 24 during the pandemic. With both optimal mitigation
and an expected vaccine arrival around one per year, mitigation while costly is temporary,
earnings reduction is thus also temporary and moreover earnings is expected to discretely
jump upward (due to both the elimination of mitigation costs and customers return once
the pandemic is over. For these reasons, prices being the present value of all future earnings,
fall much less than earnings do.
Fifth, we calculate a counterfactual for what would happen to stock prices absent any
mitigation. The market would be down 15% relative to the optimal mitigation scenario.
Our counterfactual can provide an account of asset price dynamics around COVID-19 —
dramatic plunge in late February 2020 and equally dramatic rebound in March 2020. For
instance, investors might have thought that society failed to control the virus initially (which
corresponds to our counterfactual of no mitigation leading to lower stock market values) but
5

subsequently learned that they were going to (and hence the market rebounded to the equilibrium prices under optimal mitigation). Finally, we consider comparative statics exercises
that further speak to observed asset price dynamics. Asset valuations are highly sensitive to
the vaccine arrival rate, consistent at least with anecdotes of stock market response to news
on vaccine developments.
Our paper proceeds as follows. We place our paper in related literatures in Section 2.
We present our epidemic model in Section 3 and the valuation and risk management model
in Section 4. We explore the early (pre-mitigation) dynamics of COVID-19 in Section 5.
In Section 6, we highlight the role of stochastic transmission shocks, optimal mitigation
and vaccine arrival for COVID-19’s damage to stock valuations. In Section 7, we conduct
counterfactual and comparative statics exercises. We conclude in Section 8.

Related Literatures

Our paper contributes to several literatures. In epidemiology, aggregate transmission shocks
are used in epidemiological forecasting models to capture deviations of infections from deterministic projections (see Dureau et.al. (2013) for how parameter perturbation is employed).
The analytical treatment of transmission volatility is fully articulated in Gray et al. (2011)
who characterize the stationary distribution of our non-linear diffusion process absent a vaccine. Whereas R0 > 1 determines epidemic outbreak in a deterministic model, the analogous
outbreak condition is R0 > 1, where R0 = (β − σ 2 /2)/γ in our stochastic model. Therefore, even at a reproduction number R0 above one, a sufficiently large value of σ 2 can cause
R0 < 1, which in turn implies that the epidemic becomes distinct in the limit. Zhao and
Jiang (2014) extend the baseline model set-up in Gray et al. (2011) by allowing for a third
compartment for the vaccinated. In their paper, a fraction of the population can become
vaccinated. They explore stationary distributions in this setting.
Given that a goal of our analysis is to analyze the impact of an effective vaccine arrival
on both disease spread and also valuation, we model vaccine via a Poisson jump process and
explore the impact on conditional distributions, particularly how the deterministic model

6

approximations depend on this Poisson arrival rate, and also valuation. Hence, our model’s
contribution to epidemiology is that it simultaneously accounts for a stochastic vaccine arrival, studies conditional distributions through Kolmogorov equations far from steady state,
and derives the optimal mitigation strategy. Our optimally-mitigated stochastic SIS process is new to the epidemiology literature as there is limited work on stochastic control in
epidemics.
There are other approaches to stochastic epidemics using Markov Chains. For instance,
Allen and Burgin (2000) work with Markov Chain models with a discrete state space and
one absorbing state so eventual disease extinction is guaranteed. That is, the stationary
distribution is degenerate. Our model (with no vaccine) has a non-degenerate stationary
distribution, which is better suited to explore implications of stochastic transmission shocks.
Also our model features vaccine while theirs does not. Clancy (2005) also considers a Markov
Chain SIS model set-up with no diffusion shocks where indirect transmissions (e.g., environmental bacteria and from animals to human) are possible. While this channel is relevant for
some types of diseases (e.g., Zika, a mosquito borne flavivirus), it does not seem important
for COVID-19.
In economics, recent theoretical models on controlling epidemics uses deterministic SIR
models. The work closest to ours is Kruse and Strack (2020) where they show using a deterministic SIR model that the optimal solution is typically to act early unless herd immunity is
within reach.7 Our contribution is to show how aggregate transmission shocks significantly
influence optimal mitigation strategies in an SIS setting.
For tractability, we work with an SIS set-up rather than an SIR model as doing so yields
an ODE rather than a PDE for the price-earnings ratio. While R0 is no longer a sufficient
statistic in richer SIR, SEIR, and other even richer models with multiple compartments8
Our SIS model nonetheless captures first-order insights and mechanisms. As the mitigated
I process tends to be low (near zero) most of the time in our calculations, the recovered

fraction (in an SIR model) would also be close to zero. As a result, our approximation
(which is effectively ignoring the recovered population) is likely to be sensible and hence
our insights regarding R0 and deterministic approximations also have implications for SIR
analysis.
In finance, our contribution is to link asset prices to underlying epidemiological data.
Our model is consistent with Gormsen and Koijen (2020) who use a fundamentals-based
asset-pricing model along with dividend futures to isolate a large impact of COVID-19 via
the earnings growth channel. Hong, Kubik, Wang, Xiao and Yang (2020) combine our model
with analyst forecasts to infer market expectations regarding the arrival rate of an effective
vaccine that returns earnings to normal and to estimate the direct effect of infections on
growth rates of earnings.

Stochastic Epidemic Model

In this section, for pedagogical purposes, we construct our stochastic model by starting with
the classic Kermack and McKendrick (1927) model. Time is continuous and the horizon is
infinite. We normalize the total population size to one and there is no birth nor death in
the population. As a key motivation is to design a tractable and parsimonious model to
conduct risk management applications, we only model two compartments (groups): infected
and infectious (I) and susceptible (S) (or equivalently uninfected).9 Within each group, the
population is homogeneous and well mixed. Let It and St denote the mass of the infected
population and the susceptible at time t, respectively. As It + St = 1 at all t, we only need
to keep track of the evolution for It , which is the single state variable in our model.

3.1

Deterministic SIS Model

Transmission rate in classic SIS setting. How does the disease get transmitted from an
infected to a susceptible? The probability that an infectious individual meets a susceptible is
9
In the epidemiology literature, there are various generalized formulations of these compartmental models.
Widely used ones include SIR (susceptible, infected, recovered) and SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infected,
and recovered) models. See Andersson and Britton (2012) and Brauer, Driessche and Wu (2008) for textbook
treatments.

proportional to the product of their population mass, It (1−It ), with an effective transmission
rate, which we denote by β. Thus over the interval [t, t + dt) the total number of new
infections is
βIt St dt = βIt (1 − It )dt .
The infected recovers and becomes susceptible in our model. Let γ > 0 denote the rate
at which an infected recovers. Hence, 1/γ is the duration for an infected to be infective.
Subtracting the mass for the recovered γIt dt over the interval [t, t + dt) from the newly
infected βIt (1 − It )dt, we obtain the following process for dIt , the net change of It :
dIt = βIt (1 − It )dt − γIt dt .

Figure 1: The infected fraction (It ) and the net change (dIt /dt) in a deterministic SIS model
with I0 = 2 × 10−7 based on the US data as of March 1st and γ = 2.173 per month.
Deterministic infection forecasts. In Figure 1, we plot the infected mass It at t in
Panel A and the net change of the infected mass dIt /dt in Panel B with the initial value of
I0 = 66/(3.28 × 108 ) = 2 × 10−7 (as there were 66 infective individuals on March 1st in the
US and the US population as of 2019 is 328 million.) The solid blue lines correspond to the
solution for our deterministic case using our estimate of the transmission rate for COVID-19
that we discuss in Section 5.2. By reducing β by half from 6.616 to 3.308 per month, such
as using economy-wide lockdowns, we lower the basic reproduction number R0 by half from
3.045 to 1.522 (unlike the three structural parameters, R0 is invariant to the time horizon
we choose). As a result, the eventual infected fraction, I∞ , decreases by half from 67.1% to
34.3% of the entire population.
Panel B captures the widely discussed flattening the curve argument (see, e.g., Atkeson
(2020) and Gourinchas (2020)). Here, the curve refers to the net change of the infected
population, dIt /dt, as a function of time t. If the society successfully reduces β by half
via social distancing and other interventions, this deterministic evolution curve is indeed
significantly flattened and postponed. Specifically, this curve peaks at a bit over one year
(t = 12.657 months) if β = 3.308 rather than at a bit over one quarter (t = 3.384 months).
The curve of the net change, dIt /dt, is substantially flattened.
10

Note the very sharp increase of It at the very early stage. This is because early on It is
close to zero and we can thus effectively drop the (1 − It ) terms and approximate It as an
exponential process: dIt ≈ (β − γ)It dt with the approximate solution: It ≈ I0 e(β−γ)t .
Obviously, exponential growth at a large rate β − γ is incompatible with convergence of
It to I∞ = 1 − R−1
0 as t → ∞. This is due to the dampening effect of It on its own growth.
As the fraction of the infected increases, fewer are susceptible, which lowers dIt /It . That is,
the higher the level of I, the lower the infection growth rate dIt /It .

3.2

Stochastic SIS Model

Aggregate transmission rate shock. Following Gray et al. (2011), a simple way to
model stochastic transmission is to replace the constant rate β with a stochastic rate, which
e For expositional purposes, consider a discrete-time setting. The simplest
we denote by β.
choice for a stochastic βe is an independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random
variable. Fix a small time increment ∆, we write
√
βet ∆ = β∆ + σ ∆ t ,

(4)

where both β and σ are constant parameters and t is a mean-zero standard normal random
variable.11 Mapping (4) into our continuous-time formulation, we obtain
βet dt = βdt + σdZt ,

(5)

where Zt is a standard Brownian motion.
By using βe dt given in (5) to replace βdt in (1) and then combining drift and diffusion
terms, we obtain the following stochastic differential equation (SDE) for It :
dIt = [β(1 − It ) − γ] It dt + σ It (1 − It ) dZt .

(6)

The drift term is the same as in the deterministic SIS model, while the diffusion term
captures the uncertainty of the epidemiological evolution process. When no one is infected
11

By assuming t is i.i.d., we make the transmission rate βet stochastic but without introducing an additional state variable for the transmission rate. We leave generalizations of our model to allow for a richer
specification of βet for future work.

11

(It = 0), the disease is extinct: dIt = 0 as both drift and volatility terms in (6) are zero. If
the entire population is infected (It = 1), the volatility has to be zero and the drift has to
be negative so that the model is well posed.12 Unlike It = 0, It = 1 is not an absorbing state
as γ > 0.
Note that both the drift and volatility of the growth rate for the infected population,
dI/I, depend on (1 − I), the population of the susceptible. Specifically, the higher the level
of I, the lower the drift (i.e., the expected infection growth rate) of dIt /It . As the fraction
of the infected increases, fewer are susceptible, which dampens the drift of dI/I.
To complete the description of our compartmental model, below we report the dynamics
for the susceptible population St :
dSt = (γ − βSt ) It dt − σ St It dZt .

(7)

Permanence of initial transmission shocks. The process for It given in (6) is not a
Geometric Brownian motion (GBM) process widely used in Economics and Finance. But
at a very early stage, It is close to zero; therefore, we can effectively drop the (1 − It )
terms in both drift and volatility functions and approximate It via a GBM process: dIt ≈
(β − γ)It dt + σ It dZt . That is, in the early stage, It evolves as

Unlike the exponential growth approximation for It in the deterministic model, in our
stochastic model, It is not only driven by R0 but also by the (exponential) martingale,
the second exponential term in (8). This second term is equally important in driving the
dynamics of It as the first (exponential) term involving R0 .
Because very few are infective early on, the change of It is highly idiosyncratic as the
diffusion term dominates the drift term. A few negative shocks early on have outsized
permanent effects on the evolution of It . On the other hand, if there are few such shocks early
on, then the total infected population stays low for an extended period of time causing the

epidemic models, driving how fast the disease spreads.
Three-parameter non-linear diffusion process. We now have a three-parameter (β, γ,
and σ) non-linear diffusion process. By applying Ito’s Lemma to (6), we obtain:
d ln It = q(It )dt + (1 − It )σ dZt ,

(9)

where the drift for ln It is a quadratic function in It :

Equations (9)-(10) are convenient to work with when we analyze the stationary distribution.
Stochastic Steady State (SS) and Stationary Distribution. Next we turn to the
stochastic steady state and stationary distribution to gain some intuition for why R0 is an
insufficient statistic for managing COVID-19 risks. The long-run distributional properties
of the infected fraction I depend on all three parameters in a nonlinear way. Simply relying
on R0 , which is ratio between the expected transmission rate β and exit rate γ can be quite
misleading.
Unlike in the deterministic model, which generates a single number for It at any t, in
order to fully capture the disease transmission dynamics, we next characterize the time-0
conditional distribution of It for all t. Let f (It , t; I0 ) denote the time-0 conditional density
function for It , the infected mass at t given the initial infected mass I0 .
Conditional distribution. The density function, f (I, t), satisfies the following Kolmogorov
forward equation:

and the last term is the volatility effect on f (I, t). In Section 5.3, we show how uncertainty
substantially alters the transmission dynamics.
13

Next, we incorporate the impact of stochastic vaccine arrival.

3.3

Stochastic Vaccine Arrival

We assume that COVID-19 will disappear following a successful vaccine development.13
Specifically, we use the following SDE to model the evolution of It :
dIt = [β(1 − It− ) − γ] It− dt + σ It− (1 − It− ) dZt − It− dJt .

(12)

We capture this vaccine arrival effect on It via the third term, where Jt is a (pure) jump
process with a constant arrival rate, which we denote by λ. When a vaccine is successfully
developed, i.e., dJt = 1, the pandemic is extinct. We can generalize our model to allow
for a multiple-stage vaccine development process with a gradual reduction of the infected
population without losing much analytical tractability.14

4

Managing COVID-19 Risks

In this section, we develop a parsimonious yet operational model to capture the impact of
pandemic shocks on fundamentals-based valuation. We show how COVID-19 parameters β
(equivalently R0 ) and σ together with asset-pricing specifications impact valuation.
In Section 4.1, we propose a valuation model before unanticipated pandemic arrival. In
Section 4.2, we consider optimal mitigation after an unanticipated pandemic arrival in an
asset-pricing framework. We explicitly allow for stochastic vaccine arrival in our analysis.

4.1

Valuation Before Unanticipated Pandemic Arrival

To ease our exposition and set up the basic apparatus into which we later incorporate
COVID-19 shocks, we first introduce a simple asset-pricing model with no pandemic shocks,
i.e., under normal business-as-usual environment or when It = 0.
13

The assumption that vaccine takes effect immediately is clearly made for simplicity. In reality, it may
take a while for the population to be vaccinated and not everyone will be vaccinated. We can generalize our
vaccine model to allow for a (large) fraction of the population to be vaccinated leaving a (small) fraction
still susceptible (at the cost of additional complexity.) But the core of our analysis will remain valid.
14
For brevity, we leave this extension out.

14

We start by specifying the following process for the widely-used simple stochastic discount
b t , in the normal regime:
factor (SDF), M
bt
dM
= −r dt − η B dBt ,
bt
M

(13)

where Bt is the standard Brownian motion for the aggregate shock. Here, r is the risk-free
rate and η B is the market price of risk for the aggregate shock.15 For simplicity, let r and η B
be constant. Equation (13) implies a one-factor model where the factor can be the aggregate
consumption growth shock as in a representative-agent general-equilibrium model of Lucas
(1978), or the market portfolio return in the CAPM of Sharpe (1964), the option pricing
model of Black and Scholes (1973), or the portfolio choice problem of Merton (1971). Here,
η B is positive as a positive shock dBt to the aggregate consumption growth or market return
b t.
is good news which lowers the investor’s marginal utility or equivalently M
Earnings process. We assume that the earnings process in the normal regime, Ybt , follows:
p
dYbt
= gbdt + ρφ dBt + 1 − ρ2 φ dWt ,
Ybt

(14)

where Bt is the aggregate shock introduced in (13) and Wt is the standard Brownian motion
driving earnings idiosyncratic risk. By construction, Bt and Wt are orthogonal. In (14),
gb is the expected earnings growth (drift) and φ is the volatility of earnings growth, which
p
includes the aggregate component ρφ and the idiosyncratic component 1 − ρ2 φ. That is, ρ
is the correlation coefficient between the aggregate shock Bt and the asset’s earnings process.
For simplicity, we let gb, φ, and ρ all be constant.
Pricing formula. Under the assumption that investors price earnings without expecting
the possibility of a pandemic arrival, the firm’s value in the normal regime (pre- and postpandemic) satisfies the following standard asset-pricing equation (Duffie, 2001):
!
Z ∞ b
M
s
Yb ds .
Pbt = Et
bt s
M
t
15

No arbitrage requires that the drift of Mt is equal to the minus interest rate, −r.

15

(15)

In Appendix C, using (13) and (14) and solving (15), we show that the firm’s value is
proportional to its earnings, Pbt = pb Ybt , where the price-earnings ratio, pb, is a constant:
pb =

1
.
r + ρφη B − gb

(16)


Equation (16) is the well-known Gordon growth model where r + ρφη B is the firm’s constant cost of capital (discount rate) and gb is the earnings growth rate. This firm earns a risk
premium of ρφη B , which is given by the the product of the market price of risk η B and ρφ,
the systematic volatility component of φ and consistent with the one implied by the widely
used CAPM.

4.2

Optimal Mitigation and Vaccine Arrival

Next, we incorporate pandemic shocks into our valuation model and consider the effect of
mitigation responses by both customers (consumers) and firms.
After COVID-19 arrived unexpectedly in the U.S. late February, 2020, a fraction of
consumers voluntarily engaged in social distancing and took various other precautionary
measures reducing the spread of the disease. These voluntary actions by consumers (customers) substantially cut the transmission rate but also lower corporate earnings. Let Yt
denote the earnings process during the pandemic regime. To capture this phenomenon, we
assume that logarithmic earnings drop at the moment of COVID-19 arrival time t0 by a
stochastic fraction n(It0 ). That is,
Yt0 = e−n(It0 ) Yt0 − ,

(17)

where Yt0 − is the pre-pandemic arrival earnings and Yt0 is the post-pandemic arrival earnings.
The transmission rate is also lowered due to people’ change of behaviors, e.g., quarantine,
work from home, and social distancing reduce the speed of disease spreading. Let
βt0 = (1 − ψ)βt0 − ,

(18)

where βt0 − is the disease’s transmission rate β (when the disease is not contained at all, and
in the absence of any behavioral response.) The parameter ψ measures the fraction of β
reduction due to customers’ voluntary behavioral adjustments.
16

Next, we discuss the earnings process in the pandemic regime after t0 .
Earnings process. Before the vaccine arrival at τ , we assume that Yt is given by:
p

dYt
= g(It− )dt + v(It− ) dZt + ρφ dBt + 1 − ρ2 φ dWt + en(It− ) − 1 dJt .
Yt−

(19)

COVID-19 influences Yt as follows. First, the infection shock dZt directly causes additional
earnings growth volatility, v(I). Second, the expected earnings growth rate (absent vaccine
arrival) is changed to g(I) from gb. Third, the stochastic arrival of vaccine (dJt = 1) at
t = τ causes an instantaneous (logarithmic) change of earnings from the pre-jump level,
Yt− , to the post-jump level Ybt at t = τ . For expositional simplicity, we assume that the
percentage of earnings upward jump at the moment of vaccine arrival τ is equal to the
percentage of earnings downward decrease at the moment of pandemic arrival time t0 . That
is, ln( Ybτ /Yτ − ) = n(Iτ − ), where n( · ) is the same as the n( · ) function in equation (17). We
set n(0) = 0 so that earnings is continuous (Ybτ = Yτ − ), when Iτ − = 0.
Now consider a counter-factual case that helps us understand the mechanism of the
model. Suppose τ − = t0 , which occurs if λ → ∞. For this case, earnings is not impacted at
all by the two jumps (unexpected pandemic and vaccine arrivals) as the pandemic becomes
extinct in no time Yτ = en(Iτ − ) Yτ − = en(It0 ) Yt0 = en(It0 ) e−n(It0 ) Yt0 − = Yt0 − .
Additionally, earnings is still subject to the business-as-usual aggregate shock dBt and
p
idiosyncratic shock dWt with volatility ρφ and 1 − ρ2 φ, respectively. All shocks are orthogonal to each other.16 To highlight the role of stochastic transmission shocks on both
earnings and valuation in a simple way, we assume that parameters for the business-as-usual
aggregate variables and idiosyncratic risks, do not change with the unexpected pandemic
arrival. We can of course also allow the business-as-usual parameters to also change as well
without technical difficulties, but leave these extensions out for brevity.
Indeed, [Wt , Bt , Zt ]> is a 3 × 1 standard Brownian motion and is independent of the vaccine arrival
process Jt .
16

17

SDF in the pandemic regime. As COVID-19 is clearly an aggregate shock, it changes
the equilibrium SDF. We model the SDF Mt in the pandemic regime as follows:
dMt
= −rdt − η Z dZt − η B dBt − (1 − eκ ) (dJt − λdt) .
Mt−

(20)

As a positive pandemic shock dZt (which increases I) is bad news for the aggregate economy, investors’ marginal utility (the SDF Mt ) should increase with It , which means η Z < 0,
in contrast to a positive η B for the business-as-usual aggregate shock dBt . The last term
captures the effect of stochastic vaccine arrival on the SDF Mt and this jump term is a
martingale under the physical measure (to be consistent with no arbitrage.17 Upon the successful vaccine development at t = τ , i.e., dJt = 1, the SDF immediately changes discretely
from Mτ − by Mτ = eκ Mτ − . As a vaccine arrival is good news for the aggregate economy,
investors’ marginal utility (SDF) should decrease after vaccine arrival, which implies that
the market price of vaccine arrival risk is negative, i.e., κ < 0.
Optimal stochastic control. Let {Xt ; t0 < t < τ } denote the mitigation process, which
reduces the transmission rate, during the pandemic regime. Recall our assumption that the
transmission rate is immediately reduced from the level of β (absent any behavioral response)
to βt0 by ψ fraction of β (see equation (18)). By spending Xt , the firm further lowers the
transmission rate from βt0 to βt0 − ht , where ht ≥ 0. This additional reduction obtained by
mitigation Xt captures the effects of corporate actions.
Let xt = Xt /Yt denote the scaled mitigation. We assume
ht = h(xt ) ,

(21)

where h(x) is increasing and concave in x. The motivation for the homogeneity (in earnings
Yt ) assumption underpinning equation (21) is that to cut the transmission rate by the same
magnitude h(xt ), one firm whose earnings is twice the size of another needs to spend twice
as much to achieve the same levels of reduction of the transmission rate. This assumption
is reasonable as the benefit scales up with earnings and also makes our analysis tractable.
17

Again, note that the drift rate of Mt is equal to the negative interest rate by no arbitrage (Duffie, 2001).

18

The evolution of It given in (12) with mitigation is:
dIt = [(βt0 − h(xt− ))(1 − It− ) − γ] It− dt + σ It− (1 − It− ) dZt − It− dJt .

(22)

Note that βt0 is the constant transmission rate after customers respond to the pandemic by
taking precautionary measures. That is, absent mitigation but with customers’ response,
the transmission rate is lowered from βt0 − to βt0 . The basic reproduction number is then
R0 (xt− ) =

βt0 − h(xt− )
.
γ

(23)

Additionally, we assume that mitigation is costly and lowers earnings by more than the level
of mitigation X. For simplicity we assume that mitigation incurs a (flow) fixed cost that is
proportional to Y , i.e., πYt where π > 0 is a constant measuring the size of flow fixed costs.
Let Yt∗ denote the firm’s earnings netting out of both fixed and variable costs. With the
above assumptions, the net earnings is
Yt∗ = Yt − (πYt + Xt )1Xt >0 ,

(24)

where 1Xt >0 is an indicator function that equals one if mitigation is strictly positive (Xt > 0)
and zero otherwise.
Next, we state the optimization problem. The firm chooses mitigation X to maximize
the following risk-adjusted present value in the pandemic regime:

Pt = max Et

where τ is the stochastic vaccine arrival time. Inside the expectation operator in equation
(25), there are two terms contributing to the discounted stochastic value of earnings: the
first term is the value before the arrival of vaccine at τ and the second term is the value of
after τ . Note that there is no need to spend on mitigation after τ but anticipation of vaccine
arrival at τ fundamentally impacts the agent’s optimal mitigation before τ .
Let Ct denote the corresponding present value of mitigation costs:

4.3

Solution

Valuation in the pandemic regime. Because the earnings process features geometric
growth, the firm’s value is proportional to its earnings Yt :
Pt = P (Yt , It ) = p(It )Yt ,

(27)

where p(It ) is the equilibrium price-earnings ratio.
As mitigating the disease involves a fixed flow cost πYt , the firm may choose not to
mitigate when the benefit of doing so is sufficiently low. Conditional on choosing X > 0, the
optimal scaled mitigation, x = X/Y , satisfies the following first-order condition (FOC):
1 = −h0 (x(I))I(1 − I)p0 (I) .

(28)

The level of mitigation Xt > 0 at the margin lowers the infected population mass It by
h0 (xt )It (1−It )/Yt . Since the marginal increase of value from a lower level of I is −PI (Yt , It ) =
−p0 (It )Yt > 0, the marginal benefit of choosing Xt > 0 is equal to −PI (Yt , It )×h0 (x(It ))It (1−
It )/Yt = −h0 (x(It ))It (1 − It )p0 (It ), the right side of equation (28). Optimal mitigation is
chosen so that the marginal benefit of mitigation is equal to the marginal cost (which is
one), i.e., x(I) satisfies equation (28).
In Appendix C, we obtain the following ODE for p(I):
0 = max −

(30)

is the risk-adjusted disease transmission rate (i.e., under the risk-neutral measure Q) and λQ
is the risk-adjusted vaccine arrival rate (under the risk-neutral measure Q):
λQ = λeκ .

(31)

We expect the risk-adjusted duration of the pandemic (under the risk-neutral measure Q),
1/λQ , to be longer than 1/λ, which is the expected duration of the pandemic (under the
20

physical measure P). This is because vaccine arrival is good news for the aggregate economy,
which means κ < 0, as we discussed early.
Next, we turn to boundary conditions. First, as the no-infection state is absorbing, the
price-earnings ratio at I = 0 is equal to the value in the normal regime:
p(0) = pb .

(32)

Second, consider the extreme (and counter-factual case) where everyone is infected, I = 1.
In this case, naturally there is no need to spend on mitigation, x = 0. The ODE (49) is then
simplified as




r + ρφη B + v(1)η Z + λQ − g(1) p(1) = 1 + λQ en(1) pb − γp0 (1) .

(33)

This boundary condition ties p0 (I) with p(I) at I = 1.
Next, we go back to the optimal mitigation choice x. As the effective transmission rate
depends on the product of I and S = 1 − I, mitigation is more valuable in an interior region
of I, ceteris paribus. Given the fixed cost πYt of mitigation, it is optimal for the firm to
mitigate only when I is neither too high nor too low.
The preceding reasoning implies that the solution features three mutually exclusive regions: two inaction regions and one mitigation region. Denote I and I as the endogenously
determined cutoff levels of the infected population mass for the three regions. In the regions
0 ≤ I < I and I < I ≤ 1, we have x = 0. In the region I < I < I, x > 0. The ODE for p(x)
in the mitigation region, i.e. I < I < I, is:

Finally, the endogenously cutoff levels, I and I, defining the three regions, satisfy:
p(I − ) = p(I + ),

p(I − ) = p(I + ) ,

(36)

p0 (I − ) = p0 (I + ),

p0 (I − ) = p0 (I + ) ,

(37)

p00 (I − ) = p00 (I + ),

p00 (I − ) = p00 (I + ) ,

(38)

where I − and I + are the left limit and right limit of I, and where I − and I + are the left
limit and right limit of I. That is, p(I) is twice continuously differentiable across all the
three regions over the entire support [0, 1].
In summary, p(I) and the optimal mitigation policy x(I) satisfy ODE (34) and equation
(28) in the mitigation region I ∈ (I, I), and p(I) satisfies ODE (35) in the inaction regions
I ∈ (0, I) and I ∈ (I, 1), where x(I) = 0. Solving equations (34), (28), and (35) subject
to the five sets of boundary conditions given in equation (32) at I = 0, (33) at I = 1, and
(36), (37), and (38) at the endogenously chosen thresholds, I and I, we fully characterize
the model’s solution over the entire support I ∈ [0, 1] including I and I.
PV of mitigation costs. Once we have solved our optimization problem, we can calculate
the present value of mitigation costs, C(Y, I). Let c(I) = C(Y, I)/Y . Taking optimal x(I),
I, and I as given, and using essentially the same reasoning to calculate p(I), we obtain the
following ODE for c(I):

c(I − ) = c(I + ),

c(I − ) = c(I + ) ,

(40)

c0 (I − ) = c0 (I + ),

c0 (I − ) = c0 (I + ) .

Early Dynamics of COVID-19

5.1

Data

Our data on COVID-19 cases comes from COVID-19 Data Repository by Johns Hopkins
available on github. The data keeps track of confirmed new cases, deaths, recoveries each
day starting from January 22nd, 2020. The measure It in our model maps to the net number
of outstanding infected cases at t, which is equal to the sum of the last period’s It−1 and the
newly (reported) infected cases at t and subtracting deaths and recoveries, divided by the
population of that country.
We follow leading epidemiological studies of COVID-19 and focus on China and countries
(regions) that were at high risk due to air travel connected to China (Kucharski et.al. (2020)).
There are a total of 16 countries in our sample. In Asia (Middle East), there are nine
consisting of China, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan (China), Thailand,
United Arab Emirates and Vietnam. Among Western countries, these include Australia,
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, United Kingdom, and United States.18
While all these countries have significant air travel connections to China, they did not
experience the same infection path. This is consistent with our model that each country
experienced idiosyncratic paths (realizations) of transmission shocks at early stages.
In Figure 2, we plot the logarithmic growth rate d ln(It ) for four countries of interest,
China, Singapore, US, and Italy. We can see that the epidemic curve of China reversed in
the second half, while Singapore which had a fairly flat curve in the first half took off in
the second half. The same is true for Italy and the US. Again, most of the countries in our
sample only started mitigation responses later in the second half of the sample and it took
time for them to have an effect.
18

Five of the original high-risk regions, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Philippines and Russia, had no cases
in January-February, so we exclude them from our analysis. These countries are also thought to be the most
problematic in terms of underreporting of cases. See Manski and Monlinari (2020) for a discussion of biases
in estimates of transmission rates associated with underreporting.

Estimation

We fit our model to the data for the January-February period. Given the noisiness and short
time series of the data, we do not attempt to capture the potential heterogeneity in models
across regions. Rather we think it is appropriate to fit one model by pooling the 16 regions.
We pursue a robust estimation strategy as follows. For each region, we can estimate β and
σ using the brief time series. But we use as our estimate the mean of the values across the
16 regions weighted by the number of daily observations in each region. For instance, China
has more observations in the first sub-period and thus gets more weight in our estimate. We
can then judge the sensibility of our estimates by comparing them to leading models of the
early dynamics of COVID-19.
As we have pointed out a couple of times already, most mitigation responses only started

24

in March. Hence, we view our estimates as representative of the underlying epidemic process
or early COVID-19 dynamics absent any mitigation responses.
Calibration of γ. Earlier epidemiological studies typically set γ by targeting the expected
duration for an infected and infective individual to 14 days, which implies that the rate γ is
equal to 1/14 per day, or γ = 365/12/14 ≈ 2.173 per month. (Recall that in our convention,
one period is one month.) Epidemiological studies typically view γ as highly predictable and
relatively easy to estimate. They typically model this parameter as an Erlang distribution
(Kucharski et.al. (2020)). By fixing γ, we leave out the impact of uncertainty of the exit
rate on the disease spread.
Estimate of β. In Appendix A, we derive an OLS estimator for β given γ:

the Introduction, our estimates are in line with leading studies.

5.3

Vaccine Arrival Rates and Conditional Infection Distributions

We now focus on estimates and outcomes for the US, though our discussion equally applies
to the aforementioned regions in our out-of-sample forecast analyses. We compare these
conditional forecasts to the solution for the deterministic SIS model (σ = 0). In Table 2, we
calculate the impact of vaccine arrival on the conditional mean and standard deviation of It
for varying expected arrival rates.
We start at Panel A where there is no vaccine. We report the conditional means and
variances for our stochastic SIS model with 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 weeks and 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 24 months
time horizons. Note that at the very early stage, e.g., from 1 week up to 6-8 weeks, the conditional mean forecast of I in our stochastic model is essentially the same as in the deterministic
model — this is because the stochastic exponential growth approximation works well when
It is very low. Starting from 3 months, this approximation no longer works. Deterministic
model infection forecasts based on R0 overshoot our model’s conditional forecasts by a significant mount (0.104 for the deterministic model and 0.031 for our stochastic model). This
is due to Jensen’s inequality. In around one to two years, the conditional distribution gets
sufficiently close to the stationary distribution. While the conditional distribution results
are new in our paper, the stationary distribution was characterized by Gray et al. (2011).
Furthermore, the conditional volatility is highly nonlinear and non-monotonic in the time
horizon. For example, for the 3-month-ahead forecast, the monthly volatility of It (9.5%) is
more than three times the mean (3.1%). Even with 6 months out, while the expected infected

parameter values are: β = 6.616, γ = 2.173, and σ = 1.689 per month. The implied value of

mass is 51.9% of the population, one standard-deviation is still 25.1%. The volatility declines
once we go beyond 9 months out (Around 9 months, the volatility peaks at 0.321.) In other
words, infection forecasts based on a deterministic model can be poor approximations for
the conditional forecasts of our model for a large range of periods.
Importantly, the degree to which the deterministic model is a poor approximation depends on the vaccine arrival rate. In Panels B, C, and D, we consider the expected vaccine
arrival time of 6 months, 1 year and 2 years. Consider Panel B where the vaccine is expected
to arrive in six months. In this setting, infections at 4 months is 0.323 for the deterministic
model and expected to be 0.084 for the stochastic model. In Panel A where the vaccine is
not available, the corresponding numbers are 0.630 and 0.165.
Intuitively, when the initial fraction of the infected is low, the It process is approximately
a Geometric Brownian motion with outsized drift β and volatility σ parameters. This means
that shocks early on have permanent and very large effects. A vaccine that quickly arrives
significantly truncates the duration of the pandemic substantially dampening the impact of
shocks to this I process, thereby leading to the deterministic model being a better approximation.
More generally, while an eventual vaccine arrival will make the disease extinct, the conditional moments of It vary significantly with the expected arrival vaccine rate λ. Panel B
shows that if the vaccine is expected to arrive soon (e.g., six months and hence λ = 2/12),
the current conditional forecast of It for any horizon t is much lower than without vaccine
arrival and peaks around 6 months at 19%. Panel C shows that if the vaccine is expected
to arrive in one year and hence λ = 1/12, the current conditional forecast of It for any
horizon t is much lower than the forecast without vaccine arrival (see Panel A with λ = 0).
It peaks around 6 months at 31.4%, lower than the six-month-ahead forecast of 51.9% for
the no-vaccine case, but higher than the six-month-ahead forecast of 19.1% for the more
optimistic case with λ = 2/12.
Similarly, as we increase the expected waiting time for vaccine to two years (with a
corresponding value of λ = 0.5/12 in Panel D) or no vaccine (Panel A), the expected infected
fraction can reach as high as 44% and 64% around 9 months. These high numbers indicate
28

that waiting for vaccine to arrive will cause a very large fraction of the population to be
infected absent behavioral responses even though in the long run COVID-19 goes extinct in
our model due to the eventual arrival of vaccine by assumption.

Mitigation, Earnings, and Stock Market Valuation

We now present the solution of our model. We first discuss how we calibrate our model and
then work through the four key predictions.

6.1

Calibration

Table 3 summarizes the parameter values of our calibration.
Earnings process. We set the annual earnings growth rate in normal times, gb, to 5% and
the correlation coefficient between earnings growth and business-as-usual risk, ρ, to one.
Next, we specify the impact of the pandemic shock on the asset’s earnings growth (drift)
function g(It ) as follows:


g(It ) = gb 1 − ζ1 Itζ2 ,

(46)

where gb is the drift in normal times. The two parameters that govern the impact of infection
rates on earnings growth are ζ1 and ζ2 . First, as It = 0 is an absorbing state, we set g(0) = gb
so that our pricing equation model is consistent with that under normal times. Second,
earnings growth g(It ) is decreasing with It but at a slower rate as It increases implying
ζ1 > 0 and 0 < ζ2 < 1. While there is no historical data with which we can nail down these
parameters, for our baseline we choose ζ1 = 3 and ζ2 = 0.25 so that g(0.1) = −2/3 × gb and
g(1) = −2 × gb. These are moderate long-run declines in growth rates absent mitigation. We
set v(I) = 0 for simplicity. That is, infections will only affect the drift but not the volatility
of earnings.
Finally, we specify the n(I) function in the earnings process that appear at t0 and τ as:
n(I) = α1 I α2 ,

29

(47)

where α1 > 0 and α2 > 0. Recall that I = 0 is an absorbing state and n(0) = 0. We
obtain α1 = 18% and α2 =

ln(2/3)
ln(It0 )

by targeting n(It0 ) = 12%, where It0 = 2 × 10−7 , and

n(1) = 1.5 × n(It0 ) = 18% at the moment of COVID-19 arrival time t0 .
Asset-pricing parameters. We set the annual risk-free rate r at 4%, the annual stock
market volatility σm at 20%, and the annual stock-market risk premium (rm − r) at 6%. The
implied annual Sharpe ratio of the stock market η B = (rm − r)/σm , which is also the annual
market price of business-as-usual risk in our CAPM model for the normal regime, is equal to
6%/20% = 30%. The implied asset’s beta is (ρφ/σm )×(rm −r) = ρη B φ = 1×30%×20% = 6%
and the cost of capital for this asset is equal to 4% + 1 × 6% = 10%. As we set gb = 5%, the
price-earnings ratio in normal times, pb, is then equal to 1/(10% − 5%) = 20, given by the
Gordon growth model in equation (16).19
Next we set the pandemic asset pricing parameters. We set the market price of pandemic
risk η Z at −0.4 and the market price of vaccine arrival timing risk κ at −1. As v(I) = 0,
the only effect of η Z is that for pricing purposes we need to use the risk-adjusted β Q , which
is different from β under the physical measure. Equation (30) implies the risk-adjusted
transmission rate is larger than the real transmission rate for the pandemic (controlling for
customers’ voluntary precautionary response): β Q = β(1 − ψ) − η Z σ > β(1 − ψ).
For the vaccine arrival rate λ, we set it at 1.1 per annum, consistent with optimistic
assessment by scientists in the media. With κ = −1, the risk-adjusted vaccine arrival rate is
λQ /λ = 1.1×eκ = 0.404. That is, the risk-adjusted expected duration of the pandemic regime
(under the risk-neutral measure Q), 1/λQ , is about two and half years, which is much longer
than the expected duration of the pandemic regime under the physical measure, 1/λ = .9
years.
Pre-mitigation COVID-19 dynamics, customers’ response, and mitigation technology. We take the parameter values for COVID-19 dynamics absent mitigation from our
19

For expositional simplicity, since we want to focus on the implications of vaccine arrival rates and
stochastic transmission shocks, we have set the risk-free rate and business-as-usual risk to be the same
across the normal and pandemic regimes. Of course, given the government interventions, these risks might
have changed as well and one can adjust the calibration for different parameters in the pandemic regime.

30

estimates. For the period t < t0 , where t0 is the arrival time of the COVID-19, the basic
reproduction number (absent mitigation) is Rt0 − = βt0 − /γ = 6.616/2.173 = 3.045.
After the arrival of pandemic, customers’ awareness and their voluntary cautionary measures automatically lower the speed at which the disease spreads, however, at the cost of
lower earnings. Customers who stop consuming when the pandemic arrives and will not
return until a vaccine arrives is assumed to lead to a decrease of earnings by a fraction of
1 − e−n(It0 ) = 1 − e−0.12 = 11.3%, i.e., n(It0 ) = 12% in equation (17).
The reduction of consumption also reduces the transmission rate of COVID-19. Even
absent the firm’s mitigation, the basic reproduction number decreases from Rt0 − to Rt0 =
βt0 /γ = Rt0 − (1−ψ) due to customers’ voluntary precautionary actions. By setting ψ = 0.26,
customer awareness and precaution lower the basic reproduction number to Rt0 = 3.045 ×
0.74 = 2.25 from Rt0 − = 3.045.
Next, we parameterize the firm’s mitigation technology. We assume that provided that
the firm spends on mitigation, it incurs a flow fixed cost πYt . We set π = 5%. Conditional
on choosing mitigation, the firm mitigation efficacy function takes the following form:
ht = h(xt ) = θ1 xθt 2 .

(48)

We set the parameter θ1 to 20 per year (20/12 per month) and the curvature of firm mitigation
efficacy θ2 to 0.032.

6.2

Asset Pricing Absent Mitigation by Customers and Firms

Before analyzing the impact of mitigation (by customers and firms), we first summarize the
asset valuation results absent any mitigation. This counterfactual exercise helps us better
understand the value of mitigation on valuation.
Absent mitigation, the pricing ODE (34) for p(I) can be simplified as:




(σI(1 − I))2 00
p (I)
(49)
r + ρφη B + v(I)η Z + λQ − g(I) p(I) = 1 + λQ pb +
2



+ β Q + v(I)σ (1 − I) − γ Ip0 (I) .

As neither firms nor customers mitigate, R0 = β/γ and β Q = β − η Z σ as ψ = 0.
31

In Table 4, we focus on the first case where R0 = 3.045 absent any mitigation at all time
and analyze the conditional dynamics of p(I) as we vary the vaccine arrival rate λ.
Panel A shows that without the possibility of vaccine, the price-earnings ratios without and with stochastic transmission shocks are very close and they decrease from for the
one-week ahead forecasts (5.53 and 5.64) to the long-run forecast (5.38 and 5.43), respectively. Absent vaccine and mitigation of any type, the stock market valuation reduction is
catastrophic.
Moreover, absent a vaccine and mitigation, the valuation ratio declines with the forecast
horizon due to a growth rate effect via a Gordon growth formula. We have assumed that
growth rates are adversely affected by infection levels. Since infections are expected to rise
over time, valuation ratios over time reflect increasingly lower growth rates. This result is
easiest to see in the deterministic model—in the steady state, we have a high infection rate,
negative growth and low valuation ratios.
Absent vaccine and mitigation of any type, the predictions for the deterministic and
stochastic models are quite similar. We use the simpler deterministic model to shed lights
on the mechanism. With no epidemic shocks, the It process converges to the steady state

r + ρφη B − g(I SS )
r + ρφη B − g0 (1 − ζ1 · (I SS )ζ2 )

(50)

where g(I SS ) is the long-term growth rate, r is the risk-free rate r, and ρφη B is the risk
premium. This is a version of the Gordon growth model where the sum of the latter two
terms is equal to the discount rate.
Quantitatively, with our baseline parameter values, It gets very close to I SS = 0.67 at
around 4.8 months (0.4 year) and the long-run growth rate is g(I SS ) = −8.58%. Of course.
this negative long-run growth rate is quite counterfactual. Later we show that vaccine
arrival significantly alters the model’s prediction. With r = 4% and ρφη B = 6%, we obtain
p(I SS ) = 5.384 for the deterministic model. This highly counter-factual prediction hints the
importance of the vaccine arrival and/or mitigation.
However, provided that an effective vaccine is expected to arrive and its arrival reverts
32

the economy to the normal, even absent any intervention, the price-earnings ratio becomes
much closer to what we observe in the data. This is true even when investors expect an
arrival of an effective vaccine around two years, which is on the longer end of forecasts,
as shown in Panel D. With an expected vaccine arrival time of one year (Panel C) and
stochastic transmission rates, the expected price-earnings ratio p(It ) is 15.8 (if t maps to
one week), which is 21% lower than the pre-pandemic price-earnings ratio of 20. Intuitively,
the forecasted p(I) in the long run (steady state) is equal to the pre-pandemic value pb of
20. As such, with a vaccine, valuation ratios are rising over time since the vaccine arrival is
expected to be closer the longer the forecast horizon.
Table 4 shows that even without any mitigation, whether the possibility of a vaccine
arrival is priced in or not makes a fundamental difference on valuation. The pricing results
with the possibility of vaccine arrivals are much closer to what we observe in reality. However,
as we show later in this section, purely relying on vaccine without active mitigation by firms
and/or customers, we are still unable to explain a number of other features of stock price
dynamics. Nonetheless, the preceding counterfactual reported in Table 4 serves as a natural
benchmark against which we calculate the value of optimal mitigation.
In Section 7, we conduct the counterfactual for the other case where firms do not mitigate
but customers do. In this case, R0 = β(1 − ψ)/γ. We choose ψ to target R0 = 2.25.

6.3

Optimal Mitigation Policy

In Figure 3, we plot the optimal mitigation policy x(I) as a function of ln(I). Because our
estimated reproduction number is high, the benefit of mitigation is sufficiently high. The
firm’s optimal strategy involves incurring fixed costs over a large range of infections rates
(i.e. I → 0 and I = 0.947). In our calibration, the firm mitigates even when infection rates
are tiny. For example, even when I = 2 × 10−7 , which means 66 infected in the US, the firm
chooses x(I) = 0.02. Adding the fixed cost π = 5%, the initial cost of mitigation is about
7% of the (gross) earnings.
Panel A shows that the optimal mitigation policy x(I) is non-monotonic in infection

rates. It is initially increasing with I due to the option value of waiting. Transmission
volatility implies there is a chance that the infections at very early stage will die out so it is
optimal for the firm not to choose too high x(I) for very low levels of I. Mitigation spending
peaks when the (net) infected population reaches I = 1.8% (corresponding to ln(I) = −4),
at which point it then declines due to congestion effects since the susceptible population
(1 − I) decreases.
In Panel B, we see that mitigation ensures that the basic reproduction number R0 (x)
stays at around 1.56. Only when It ≥ 0.947, the firm no longer mitigates. As a result, R0 (x)
goes back up to 2.25 which is the reproduction number when only customers mitigate and
the firm loses around 11.3% of its (gross potential) earnings as a result.

34

In Panel C, we plot the price-to-earnings ratio pe(It ) = Pt /Yt∗ where Yt∗ is earnings net of
mitigation costs. Because of optimal mitigation and a vaccine arrival rate of 1.1 per annum,
the price-to-earnings ratio is actually higher during the pandemic than the price-to-earnings
ratio pb in the normal period, which is 20 in our baseline specification. The reason is that
earnings are net of mitigation costs which pulls down the denominator in pe(I) but the price
Pt is less affected by mitigation as vaccine arrival effectively shortens the duration of the
pandemic making the COVID-19 shock transitory. Notice that pe(I) first rises and then
decreases with mitigation x, as mitigation x(I) peaks for an interior value of I.
Finally, in Panel D, we also plot ce(It ) = Ct /Yt∗ , the present value of mitigation costs
scaled by earnings Yt∗ (net of mitigation costs) as a function of ln(I). The present value
of these costs peaks also first increases and then decreases with infection rates. Notice
moreover that even when I ≥ 0.947, c(I) remains positive and high since there is a chance
that infections might fall to a lower value, at which point mitigation becomes valuable again.

6.4

Optimally-Mitigated Infection and Earnings Processes

To better understand our model’s mechanism, we simulate a path of outcomes in Figure 4
with the initial value of Y−0.5 = 1 at t = −0.5. At t = 0, the pandemic unexpectedly arrives
with an initial infection level of I0 = 2×10−7 . Panel A show a path of the optimally mitigated
earnings process Yt∗ . It jumps down at t = 0 for two reasons. One is that some customers
withdraw consumption and the other is the firm’s optimal mitigation. As a result, earnings
Yt∗ drops by around 20% at t = 0, remains relatively low during the pandemic (0 < t < 1)
compared with the pre-pandemic period (−0.5 < t < 0), and then rebounds by a discrete
amount when the vaccine arrives at t = 1 for two reasons, customers demand jump back up
and the elimination of mitigation costs.
The infection process It cannot be perfectly controlled due to aggregate transmission
shocks in contrast to deterministic models. While the COVID-19 infection process I is well
managed most of the time, It still once in a while spikes up exceeding 1 × 10−3 , as we see in
Panel B. Panels E and F show that mitigation at the intensive margin Xt and the present
value of mitigation costs, Ct , fluctuates with infection rate It .

Figure 4: In this simulation, the pandemic unexpectedly arrived at t = 0 and the vaccine
arrives at t = 1. Customers’ precautionary responses lower the basic reproduction number
from R0− = β0− /γ = 3.045 (based on our pre-mitigation estimates) to R0 = β0 /γ = 2.25
absent the firm’s mitigation. The simulation starts with Y−0.5 = 1 and the initial level of the
infection rate is I0 = 2 × 10−7 at t = 0. All parameter values are given in Table 3.

6.5

Stock Price and Price-to-Earnings Ratios

We next turn to stock price dynamics. Panel C of Figure 4 shows that the stock price Pt
jumps downward at t = 0 when the pandemic unexpectedly arrives and upward at t = 1
when the vaccine arrives. In the interim, the higher infection realizations lead to lower asset
prices. These features match well the experience of a number of countries including the US
that had to deal with unexpected resurgence of COVID-19 in early March, followed by a
period where the reproduction number fell but then unexpectedly rose in the Summer of
2020.
Moreover, Panel D shows more precisely that the price-to-earnings (net of mitigation
36

of costs), pet = Pt /Yt∗ , is actually higher during the pandemic than in the normal period
consistent with data. The median price-to-earning ratio has risen from around 20 prepandemic to around 23.5 during the pandemic. With both optimal mitigation and a vaccine
expected to arrive around one year, infections rarely get out of hand and the mitigation costs
are temporary. Hence, prices do not fall much even as earnings Yt∗ are temporarily low.

Figure 5: Counterfactual analysis: Comparing simulated paths for earnings (net of mitigation costs) Yt∗ , It , stock price Pt , and price-earnings ratio pet = Pt /Yt∗ with and without
mitigation. All parameter values are given in Table 3.
Finally, we demonstrate the effect of mitigation via a counterfactual in Figure 5 for
what would happen to stock prices absent mitigation by the firm. This is the second case
37

described in Subsection 6.2, where customers’ voluntary and precautionary measures causes
the basic reproduction number R0 to drop from 3.045 to 2.25 once the public becomes
informed about the pandemic at t0 . The red lines depict the no-mitigation counterfactual.
First, notice that at t = 0, earnings (net of mitigation costs), Yt∗ , falls less when the firm
does not mitigate. But Yt∗ nonetheless still falls since some customers would withdraw
purchases. Moreover, because the firm does not mitigate, the infection rate is much higher
as we can see from Panel B. The earnings level with mitigation is initially lower than if
the firm did not mitigate. However, earnings under the no-mitigation scenario deteriorates
more than under the mitigation scenario. This of course is because infections get out of
control with about 80% of the population infected at t = 0.6 in this simulation. This higher
level of infections damages earnings growth. Once the vaccine arrives (in our simulation at
t = 1), earnings actually jump more and end up being higher with mitigation than without
mitigation. Because stock price Pt is proportional to earnings in the post-pandemic regime
with the same coefficient given in equation (16), stock price also jumps more with mitigation
than without at t = 1. In summary, the mitigation strategy outperforms the non-mitigation
counterfactual because earnings and price are higher under the mitigation scenario when the
vaccine arrives.
As a result, the stock market absent mitigation would be down by about 15% relative to
the stock price under the optimal mitigation policy (Panel C). In contrast to the mitigation
scenario, where the pe ratio hovers around 23.5, pe ratio is below 20 in the no-mitigation
counterfactual (as seen in Panel D) due to multiple channels: damage to earnings growth
and higher risk premia for stochastic transmissions. Hence, mitigation leads to less damage
to stock markets.
Our model and this counterfactual in particular can give an account of asset price dynamics — dramatic plunge in the stock market in late February 2020 and equally dramatic
rebound in late March 2020. An-oft cited explanation for the rebound is that unexpected
government intervention help alleviate elevated risk premia due to COVID-19 (Elenev, Landvoigt, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2020)). In our model, an important source of elevated risk
premia and stock market volatility is aggregate transmission shocks.
38

But interventions by the Federal Reserve Bank in credit markets also coincided with a
strong response by society to mitigate via social distancing. As such, our counterfactual also
points to another explanation. Investors might have thought that society failed to control
the virus initially (which corresponds to our counterfactual of no mitigation leading to lower
stock market values) but subsequently learned that they were going to (and hence the market
rebounded to the equilibrium prices under optimal mitigation).

7.2

Comparative Statics

Next, we consider several key comparative statics to gain further insights about our model.
Effect of transmission volatility σ. In Figure 6, we examine how our solution varies
with transmission volatility σ. Our focus is on x(I). First, Panel A shows that when the
infected population is small, the higher the volatility, the lower the mitigation level x(I).
This is due to the option value of waiting at low levels of I. When I is low, the drift of
I is positive and large. When transmission volatility σ is low, the dynamics of I is similar
to a deterministic model. In the case with both low σ and low I, mitigating early and
aggressively is optimal as it is very likely that I becomes large rather quickly (the drift of
ln(I) is exploding). However, when I is low and σ is large, it is possible that the disease may
die out on its own when there are only a few infected.20 This explains why x(I) decreases
with σ when the infection rate I is low.
While the infected population I is large, the effect of σ on x(I) reverses: the higher the
volatility σ, the higher the level of mitigation x(I). The intuition is as follows. When I is
sufficiently high, the drift of I is negative due to the congestion effect (as the susceptible
population S = 1 − I is low) and mitigation decreases with I. Fixing I at a high value, a less
volatile I process is more likely to take I to the left (as the negative drift effect of I plays a
stronger role). As a result, the marginal benefit of mitigating when σ is low is smaller. This
implies that for sufficiently high values of I, mitigation increases with σ.
20

Consider the scenario where a few infected all quarantine themselves. In this case, the disease becomes
extinct.

Figure 7: The effects of vaccine arrival rate λ on mitigation x(I) and R0 (x). All parameter
values are given in Table 3.
Effect of vaccine arrival rate λ. Figure 7 shows that the (scaled) mitigation level xt
decreases with the vaccine arrival rate λ (see Panel A). The intuition is as follows: The longer
40

the (expected) duration of the disease 1/λ, the more valuable it is for the firm to spend on
mitigation as shocks to I are highly persistent. Mitigating today lowers I which in turn
lowers the future I in expectation. The longer the pandemic, the more valuable mitigation
is and hence the higher the level of mitigation. The general non-monotonic pattern of x(I)
remains for a given λ.
Panel B demonstrates the effects of λ on R0 (x). As R0 (x) decreases with mitigation x,
which decreases with λ, it is immediate to see that R0 (x) increases with λ. However, the
quantitative effect is small. This suggests that the firm has a target R0 when choosing to
mitigate. When the firm chooses not to mitigate, its R0 (x) shoots up as we see when I is
near one.

Figure 8: The effects of vaccine arrival timing risk premium κ on mitigation x(I) and R0 (x).
All parameter values are given in Table 3.
Effect of vaccine timing risk premium κ. Panel A of Figure 8 shows that the higher
the vaccine arrival timing risk (a more negative value of κ), the more costly the pandemic
shock is. As a result, the benefit of mitigating the disease increases with vaccine timing
risk |κ| and therefore mitigation x increases with |κ| for a given level of I. The general
non-monotonic pattern of x(I) remains for a given κ.
Panel B demonstrates the effects of κ on R0 (x). As R0 (x) decreases with mitigation x,
41

it is immediate to see that the higher the risk premium (a more negative κ), the lower the
value of R0 (x). However, the quantitative effect is small. Again, this suggests that the firm
has a target R0 when choosing to mitigate. When the firm chooses not to mitigate, its R0 (x)
shoots up as we see when I is near one.

Effect of lower interest rate r in the pandemic regime. In Figure 9, we show that
as we decrease the (annualized) interest rate r (from 4% to 1%), the future earnings carry
a greater weight for valuation, and as a result, mitigation x(I) increases (Panel A). Panel
B shows that the endogenous R0 is about the same for both levels of r. Panel C shows
that the equilibrium price-earnings ratio pe(I) as a result increases as r decreases. That is,
as fiscal and monetary intervention measure were taken, pe(I) naturally increases. Panel D
42

shows that the (scaled) present value of mitigation cost, ce(I), also increases as the interest
rate decreases, again for the same present-value argument: higher mitigation spending x(I)
discounted at a lower rate.

Effect of higher business-as-usual risk premium in the pandemic regime. In Figure 10, we show that as we increase the (annualized) market price of business as usual risk η B
(from 30% to 60%), the future earnings carry a smaller weight for valuation, and as a result,
mitigation x(I) decreases (Panel A). Panel B shows that the endogenous R0 is about the
same for both levels of η B . Panel C shows that the equilibrium price-earnings ratio pe(I) as a
result decreases as η B increases. Panel D shows that the (scaled) present value of mitigation
cost, ce(I), also decreases as the market price of business as usual risk η B increases, again
43

for the same present-value argument (a higher market price of risk discourages mitigation
spending and lowers the present value, ce(I).)

Conclusion

We propose a parsimonious epidemic model that highlights the importance of transmissionrate shocks due to unpredictable environmental factors and the prospect of stochastic vaccine arrival. The model is a four-parameter nonlinear diffusion process amenable for riskmanagement applications in areas such as economics and finance. We integrate the model
into an asset-pricing framework that accounts for a potential vaccine and optimal mitigation so that we can quantify the financial damage of COVID-19 and relate this damage to
epidemic data.
Our model has a number of implications for risk management including (1) the accuracy
of deterministic model approximations depend on the vaccine arrival rate; (2) transmission
volatility introduces an option-value-of-waiting consideration for the firm causing the optimal
mitigation policy to be non-monotonic in infection rates; (3) a pandemic can lead to higher
price-to-earnings ratios; and (4) stock market values would be significantly lower absent
mitigation.

Estimation of β. We use ordinary least squares (OLS) method to estimate the parameter
β for a given value of γ. Discretizing It in (6) gives

Derivation Details for Valuation

Valuation in the normal regime. In the normal regime no arbitrage implies that the
b t Ybt dt + d(M
b t Pbt ) is zero (Duffie, 2001). By applying
drift under the physical measure for M
Ito’s Lemma to this martingale, we obtain

(C.61)

The above equation implies Pb(Yb ) satisfies the following pricing equation:

φ2 Yb 2 b00 b
rPb(Yb ) = Yb + gb − ρφη B Yb Pb0 (Yb ) +
P (Y ) .

(C.62)

By solving the above ODE, we obtain Pb(Yb ) = pb Yb where pb is given by equation (16).
Valuation and mitigation in the pandemic regime. In the pandemic regime, no arbi
trage implies that the drift under the physical measure for Mt− Yt− − (πYt− + Xt− )1Xt− >0 dt+
d (Mt Pt ) is zero. The pricing function depends on both Yt and It . Hence, we write Pt =

into (C.63), we obtain the ODE (49) for p(I). Using the first-order condition (FOC) for the
HJB equation (C.63), we obtain equation (28) for the optimal mitigation x(I).
