ABSTRACT
China’s emerging labor market was buffeted by changes in demand and supply and institutional changes
in the last two decades. Using the Chinese Urban Household Survey data from 1989 to 2009, our study
shows that the market responded with substantial changes in the structure of wages and in employment
and types of jobs that workers obtained that mirrors the adjustments found in labor markets in advanced
economies. However, the one place where the Chinese labor market appears to diverge from the labor
markets in advanced countries is the rapid convergence in earnings and occupational positions of cohorts
who entered the job market under more or less favorable conditions. On this dimension, China’s labor
market seems more flexible than those in other countries. Three related factors may explain this pattern:
(1) the rapid growth of China’s economy; (2) the high rate of employee turnover; (3) the relative weakness
of internal labor markets in China. Bottom line, the Chinese labor market has responded about as
well as one could expect to the changes in the demand and supply factors and institutional shocks in
this critical period in Chinese economic history.

Until China began its post-Mao economic reforms, the country did not have a genuine labor
market. State owned enterprises were the only source of demand for labor. Administrative agencies
assigned workers to firms, so individual choice did not determine labor supply. Then China began the
process of transitioning from a state-run economy to a more market-driven one. The early reforms
focused on agriculture and product markets but slowly the government freed firms to make labor
demand decisions and freed workers to choose their own places of work, creating a genuine labor
market. How did this emergent labor market respond to shifts in the supply and demand for labor as
China's urban economy grew rapidly?
This paper uses data from the National Bureau of Statistics' (NBS) Urban Household Survey1
from 1989 through 2009, which covers the period when China’s labor market developed, to examine
how the emergent labor market altered China's wage structure and occupations attained by workers
with different levels of schooling. It develops a pooled cross-province time series data set from the
NBS files to assess market responses to shifts in supply and demand. We find that:
(1) Replacing administrative decisions with market wage determination widened the wage
structure along several dimensions. Educational earnings differentials increased, then stabilized.
Experience differentials fell through 1990, then rose. The dispersion of earnings grew massively,
especially for older workers whose pay had been constrained during the years of administrative rule.
(2) The wages and employment of young workers varied with the market conditions when they

NBS has conducted the Urban Household Survey yearly since 1986. The aggregate statistics are
published in China Statistical Yearbooks. The NBS urban household surveys use a stratified two-stage random
sampling method. In the first stage, NSB selects cities and counties according to population size to ensure the
sample is representative of the urban population. In the second stage, within each selected location, the survey
samples sub-districts (street committees), resident committees, and households successively. Each year 1/3 of the
households from the second stage are rotated out and replaced by new households, so that the sample is renewed
every 3 years. The NBS urban household survey begins with items on the individual’s demographic and
employment status, followed by various month-end income forms. The rest of the survey records information on
the household’s daily expenditure. Local NBS offices collect the data, which is then aggregated into the annual
data. The NBS urban household surveys did not ask about hours of work until 2002, so we could not calculate
the hourly wage rate and instead used annual earnings. Unlike the U.S. Current Population Survey, the NBS asks
respondents the year when they start working, which allows us to identify different entry cohorts of workers.

first sought work, much as the wages and employment vary with business cycles in the US and other
advanced countries. But whereas in those countries cohort effects persist for over a decade, in china
cohort effects associated with the supply/demand balance diminished within three years.
(3) Direct measures of supply and demand factors impacted the wage structure. Higher cohort
sizes reduced earnings and increased the dispersion of earnings, largely for starting graduates. Rising
GDP raised the level and dispersion of earnings, again more for starting graduates than for more
experienced workers. But the labor market also adjusted to change with changes in the rate of
joblessness and changes in the occupational position of workers with given years of education.
Overall, the adjustments in China to changes in supply and demand are similar to those in the
US (which faced more modest market pressures) while the decay of cohort differentials suggests
greater wage flexibility in China.
Transition to Genuine Labor Market
We start our analysis with a brief summary of the economic reforms that created a functioning
labor market in China.
Prior to the reforms state owned enterprises (SOE) employed nearly all urban workers.
Enterprises could not lay off workers and rarely discharged them for poor performance, effectively
creating “iron rice bowl” life-time employment. The state assigned workers to jobs in work units and
did not permit them to change jobs on their own accord. The labor bureau used the same wage grid to
determine workers’ salaries across enterprises, industries and regions. The grid included 8 grades for
blue-collar workers and 24 grades for white-collar including professional, technical, and managerial
employees. The wage differences across enterprises, industries and regions, were small. The state set
wages at a low level, but work units provided benefits to employees such as free housing, pension,
child care, and medical service. Individual SOEs paid retirees the same salaries as when they were
working. The wage structure was highly compressed.
3

In the 1980s, the central government loosened its grip on the labor market. It allowed SOEs to
set wages for their employees though the government still controlled the total payroll. It allowed SOEs
to fire employees who did not perform adequately, though SOE jobs remained more secure than jobs in
private or foreign and joint ventures. Passage of “the CPC’s Resolution on Economic Institutional
Reform” in 1984 allowed for greater variation in pay across and within establishments (Zhang et al.,
2005).
After 1990, Ministry of Labor started piloting a new job-based pay system in selected state
enterprises. It conducted a job evaluation exercise and then paid employees a base salary according to
the position they hold.2 The base pay also reflects the market value of the job. As cash compensation
became more market-based, the government relieved enterprises from providing housing, medical
service, and pension benefits to their employees. Housing was privatized, and the government
established social funds of pension, health, and unemployment insurance. In these reforms the state
differentiated among workers who retired before 1997, those who started work before 1997 and were
still working then and those who started after 1997 in ways that meant that the reforms had a smaller
impact on the older cohorts than on younger cohorts. For example, the older cohorts receive housing
subsidy if their firm did not provide them apartments, while newer cohorts are not entitled to such
benefits. This policy is described as “New People new rule, old people old rule”.
In the mid and late 1990s state enterprises laid off millions of workers, which raised
joblessness among urban workers. By the mid 1990s the labor bureau no longer allocated college
graduates to jobs; individuals could choose their own workplace (Wei et al., 1997). In the 2000s as
employment shifted to town and country enterprises and eventually to private enterprises, the
government enacted laws that made it easier for the All China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) to
organize workers and encouraged ACFTU unions to represent workers rather than being “transmission

belts” for the state and party. The Contract Labor law, which took effect in 2008, required firms to give
migrant workers written contracts and strengthened worker rights to obtain permanent jobs.
Changes in Demand and Supply
The incipient labor market faced huge shifts in demand and supply associated with China's
transition to a more market-based economy. Demand for labor increased massively due to China's
rapid post reform economic growth. From the late 1980s to 2009, the annual average GDP growth rate
was 9.6% according to official government statistics, albeit with business cycle swings around the
average growth rate (Gong and Lin, 2008; Gao, 2007; Imai, 1996). NBS's China Statistical Yearbooks
show that GDP growth rates plunged to 4.1 and 3.8 percent in 1989 and 1990, reaching the lowest level
since the reform, and experienced another slow-down in 1998-1999. China expanded steadily from
2000 to 2008-2009 when the global financial crisis broke out. Part of China's increased demand for
labor stemmed from exports. From 1989 to 2000 exports increased at an annual average rate of 16%.
After China joined the WTO in 2001, the annual export growth rate increased to over 20%. Rapid
export growth raised the demand for labor, especially low-skilled manufacturing workers. Another
driver of China’s economic growth was domestic fixed capital investment (FCI). The ratio of FCI to
GDP increased from 27% to 65% during 1989-2009.
The result of the strong economic growth was that employment increased from 520 million in
the late 1980s to 740 million in 2009.
On the supply side, China's population of working age persons has varied with the size of birth
cohorts. The size of birth cohorts declined during the Great Famine period 1958-1961, then increased
in the baby boom in the 1960s. There was another birth bust in the late 1970s as the Great Famine
cohort entered reproductive age, followed by a mild baby boom in the early 1980s. The demographic
cycle produced a large increase in supply in the 1980s when the post-famine baby boomers entered the
labor force. Investments in education boosted the supply of skilled workers massively in the 1990s and
5

2000s. The number of persons graduating college annually increased 570,000 in 1989 to about 6
million in 2009. Enrollments in high school increased from 2.4 million in the late 1980s to 8.2 million
in 2009.
Since the major labor market reforms in wage determination took place from the 1990s through
the 2000s (Zhang et al., 2005; Appleton et al. 2005; Knight and Song, 2003), the Urban Household files
provide evidence on the way in which the incipient labor market determined wages and employment in
a period of huge economic change.
Education, Experience, and Cohort Earnings Differentials
Figures 1 and 2 display earnings differentials by education and experience from 1989 through
2008. Figure 1 shows that differentials in earnings between educational groups were small at the outset
of the period and decreased from 1989 to 1991 but then increased after 1992. Figure 2 shows that
experience pay differentials were relatively high at outset, decreased in the 1990s, bottomed out in
1999, then increased after 2000.
Since the data in both figures are averages unadjusted for other attributes of workers, they will
be affected by changes in workers’ characteristics over time and across the groups. To see whether the
pattern of differentials in the figures hold up in the presence of other characteristics of workers, we
estimated earnings differentials for education and years of experience from regressions that included
measures of other characteristics (see regressions in Appendix A). The pattern of earnings coefficients
for education and experience over time resemble those in figures 1 and 2. Together, figures 1 and 2 and
the Appendix regressions suggest that young and skilled workers benefited most from the
transformation of labor market in the early 1990s, but that increased supplies of young educated
workers narrowed the educational differential while widening the experience differential.
In developed countries the wages and employment of younger workers vary more with
economic conditions than do those of older workers. Cohorts that begin their work lives during a
6

recession obtain lower earnings than cohorts that begin their work lives during boom years. Studies
have also found that the earnings differentials due to the temporary conditions of the time of entry into
the job market tend to persist for much of the work life (Rauum and Røed, 2006; Oreopoulos et al.,
2006; Kahn, 2006; Oyer, 2006; Baker et al., 1994; Beaudry and DiNardo,1991; Freeman,1981.) To see
whether cohort starting earnings vary substantially in China and whether cohort effects persist over
time, we tabulated the log earning for workers who just left school to begin work and the earnings of
the same cohorts three and five years later.
Column 1 of table 1 records the annual earnings of graduates who started work in each year
from 1989 to 2009. Since graduation takes place in June, the earnings cover at most one half a year.
Graduates who did not find work within six months of graduation are not included in the sample.
Column 2 records the annual earnings of that same cohort in the first full year after leaving school.
The table also records earnings of that cohort with 3 and 5 years of experience in the job market. For
example, the 1989 figures in column 1 give earnings in the first half year of work life for graduates in
that year, the earnings in column 2 give earnings for the same group in 1990, while the earnings in
column 3 give that cohort's earnings in 1992 and the earnings in column 4 give cohort earnings in 1994.
By inspection starting earnings are more volatile than earnings in the first year, which are more volatile
than earnings in the third and fifth year. Formally, the standard deviation of the annual growth of
earnings in 1989 to 2004, when we have earnings for all of the relevant groups are: 0.125 (starting);
0.081 (first year); 0.078 (third year); 0.078 (fifth year). As in other countries the earnings of new
entrants in China varies more over time than the earnings of the same cohort later in its working life.
Columns 5 to 8 of table 1 record the difference in mean earnings of workers at their first postschooling job and three or five years later. Although the Urban Household Survey does not have
longitudinal data for individuals, we can infer the longitudinal wage growth for a cohort from the cross
section data. The difference in pay between persons of age n in year 0 and age n+t t years in the future
7

is an unbiased estimate of change in earnings for the cohort. This is because the survey is a random
sample in both periods.
To see whether a cohort that starts with relatively low earnings due to a bad labor market when
they first enter the job market catches up with other cohorts or falls further behind, and conversely
whether a cohort that starts with relatively high earnings due to a good labor market loses its advantage
over time we regressed the changes in earnings in columns (5)-(8) on an estimate of whether the
starting salary reflected a good or bad initial market. The estimated market condition was the residual
from a regression of ln starting salary on a time trend. Panel A of table 2 records the regression
coefficients and standard errors for the relation between cohort growth and the residual of the cohort's
starting growth. The results show substantial “regression to the mean” in the form of sizable negative
coefficients on starting or first year earnings. If the starting salary was lower in a year by 10% from the
predicted trend, the growth rate in the first 3-5 years would be 12-14% percent higher than it otherwise
would have been, implying an approximately 3 year catch up period. This is a much faster catch-up
than is found in the US and other advanced countries.
Dispersion of Pay
Figure 3 displays two measures of wage inequality: the variance of ln earnings and the ratio of
the earnings of workers in the 75th percentile to the earnings of those in the 25th percentile of the
earnings distribution for all workers and for those with specified levels of experience. Both measures
show a huge increase in dispersion from relatively low levels at the outset to high levels at the end of
the period, albeit with variation over time. Consider, for example, the pattern of change in the variance
of ln earnings. The variance more than triples from 0.20 in 1989 to peak at about 0.65 in 2008 and then
falls to 0.55 in 2009. Within each experience group, moreover, both the variance and the quantile
measure of inequality increase substantially, especially during the 1990s. And dispersion increased
more for the older groups of workers than for the younger group of workers. This is different from the
8

pattern of increase in wage dispersion in the US, where dispersion increased more for younger workers
than for older workers (Autor et al., 2008; 2005). A likely reason for the greater increase in dispersion
among the older workers is that their pay was still compressed from the pre-reform labor market,
creating exceptionally low dispersion at the beginning of our period.
Quantitative Adjustments
Labor markets do not rely exclusively on price adjustments to deal with shifts in demand and
supply. They also respond through quantitative adjustments in the form of changes in hours worked,
unemployment, conditions of work, and so on. The Urban Household Survey does not identify workers
without of jobs who actively search for work, so we cannot measure the impact of the changing market
conditions on the standard rate of unemployment. Instead we focus on the employment rate – the ratio
of persons in a given group employed – and on the quality of jobs that the employed obtain -- measured
as the proportion of the group who work in jobs that would seem to fit more educated workers –
managerial, professional, technical and clerical jobs. The Urban Household Survey does not have more
detailed information on occupations for a more refined measure of the jobs.
Figure 4 shows that the employment rate fell during the reform period, particularly in the mid to
late 1990s as SOEs displaced workers and again in the early 2000s and late 2000s when economic
growth slowed. The figure also shows the near universal pattern in which the less experienced group of
workers had lower employment rates than more experienced workers.
Figure 5 looks at the quality of jobs that the employed get, in terms of the proportion of workers
in a white collar occupation for workers with different years of schooling. College graduates
experienced a decline in the good occupation rate while high school and junior high graduates had a
slight increase in the rate. Before the reform, the government assigned college graduates to white
collar jobs. Post 2000 the huge increase in the supply of college graduates increased the supply of
graduates so much that market demand was not enough to employ the same proportion in those areas as
9

in the past. This is a normal labor market response to huge increases in the supply of graduates.
Figure 6 shows that the proportion of workers who obtain white collar jobs in a cohort rises
with experience. The line for starting workers is the lowest in most years while the line for workers
with five or more years experience is the highest in almost every year. The proportion of the workers
starting in good jobs varies substantially more over time than the proportion of more experienced
workers in good jobs.3 The figure also shows that the gap between the two groups widened in recent
years.
To see whether workers who started in a less desirable job recovered over time (as occurred
with earnings) we regressed the change in the proportion of workers in a good job of a cohort on the
estimated “excess” proportion of that cohort who started in a good occupation – the deviation of the
proportion from a time trend. The estimates in panel B of table 2 for starting jobs and jobs in the first
year after leaving school show negative coefficients on the starting or first year job similar to the
negative coefficients in earnings in panel A of the table. The results suggest that if the starting
occupation was lower in a year by 10%, the growth rate in the first 3-5 years would be 7-17% percent
higher, and it would take approximately 3-4 years to catch up in terms of occupational attainment.
Again, the effect of entering in a weak or strong labor market decays fairly quickly.
Estimated Demand and Supply Effects from Provincial Data
Our analysis has shown what happened over time, but twenty-one years of time series data is
inadequate to estimate the impacts of shifts in demand and supply on the structure of wages or
measures of quantitative adjustment. Accordingly, we developed a pooled time series cross province
data set from the Urban Household Survey We calculated mean earnings, dispersion of earnings, and
the quantitative measures of labor outcomes for workers entering the labor market at different years for
3
To see whether the pattern of occupation status is affected by personal characteristics, we run
regressions of starting, 1st, 3rd, and 5th year occupation on entry year dummies and measures of
individual’s personal characteristics. The regression results are in the Appendix B. The results show
similar differences by experience and time to those in the figures.
10

each province. We also estimated the size of cohorts and the average education, and experience level of
workers by entry year for each province. We merged these data with China Statistical Yearbook
measures of GDP, exports, and fixed capital investment at the province level. We then estimated the
relation between a measure of the supply of workers -- the ln number of persons in a cohort in a
province-- and a measure of demand -- ln GDP in the province -- on labor market outcomes for cohorts
with different levels of experience.
Table 3 reports the results of this analysis for three groups of workers: workers in the first year
of their career after leaving school; workers with three years of experience; and workers with five years
of experience. Since provinces differ substantially in their economic development, the regressions
under the title “models with province dummies” include dummies for each of the provinces. Since
provinces may also differ in the speed of reforms and adjustments, the regressions under the title
“models with dummy variables and province trends” also include independent trend terms for each
province.
There are three findings in the table. First, the coefficients on the cohort size variable and on
entry year GDP are much greater and statistically significant for the workers in their first year than for
those with three or five years experience. Cohort size has a sizable negative impact on mean ln
earnings, standard deviation of ln earnings, and the log of the quartile differences in earnings
regardless of the model for the workers beginning their careers compared to much weaker effects for
the other groups. Being in a large cohort depresses starting wages and increases the dispersion of pay
for the group but the cohort size effects largely disappear for the older groups. Second, the coefficients
on the entry year ln GDP variable are weaker in the models that include province trends than in those
that do not. Absent province trends, entry year GDP has a significant impact in every calculation for
all of the groups. Higher province level GDP raises earnings, raises dispersion of pay and raises the
employment rate and the proportion of workers in white collar jobs, as shift in demand for labor should
11

do. Addition of the province trends reduces the significance of the estimated coefficients in all the
calculations and essentially eliminates the effect of entry year GDP for workers with five years of work
experience. Third, the calculations show that cohort size and entry year GDP have weaker and less
consistent effects on the employment rate and percentage of workers in white collar jobs than o the
wage variables. The estimated effects for cohort size are significant only on the employment rate for
workers in the first year of their career while the estimated effects for entry year level GDP are strong
for several groups.
In sum, the province level data in table 3 supports the notion that changes in supply and demand
impact starting workers more than others and that cohort effects are short-run only. We interpret the
positive coefficients on the size of cohort and on ln GDP on the measures of dispersion as reflecting
similar phenomenon: an increase in the number of workers spreads workers over a larger number of
firms with differing wages; while an increase in GDP increases in the number of places hiring workers,
which also spreads workers over jobs with differing wages.
Finally, we estimated the impact of changes in demand as a cohort gains experience on changes
in earnings conditional on the initial earnings of the cohort. The dependent variable in these regressions
is the change in mean earnings for a cohort from year 1 to year 3 from year 1 to year 5 by province and
year. The independent variables are the growth of GDP and the ln earnings of the cohort in year 1. The
estimated coefficients on the demand side variables show the sensitivity of longitudinal earnings
patterns to changes in demand as a cohort ages. The estimated coefficients on the ln earnings in the first
year provide another test of the “catch up effect” in longitudinal earnings growth, in this case
conditional on the increase in demand. The estimates provide strong support for both the effect of
demand factors and for catch-up. Workers with lower starting earnings had a greater earnings growth
from year 1 to 3, 3 to 5, and 1 to 5. Stronger economic growth coincided with the greater earnings
growth.

Conclusion
China's emerging labor market was buffeted by huge changes in demand, and supply in the
1990s and 2000s. Our analysis shows that the market responded with substantial changes in the
structure of wages and in employment and types of jobs held that largely mirror the adjustments found
in labor markets in advanced countries. Using province level data over time, we find that wages,
dispersion of wages, employment rates and the percent of workers who obtain white collar jobs are
substantially affected by supply as measured by cohort size and demand forces, as measured by GDP.
The one place where the Chinese labor market appears to diverge from labor markets in
advanced countries is the rapid convergence in earnings and occupational position of cohorts who
entered the job market under more or less favorable conditions. On this dimension China's labor
market seems more flexible than those in other countries. Three related factors may explain this
pattern: 1) the rapid growth of the Chinese economy, which may overwhelm short term fluctuations in
the fortunes of particular cohorts ; 2) the high rate of turnover in China, where prior to 2008 average
turnover rate was over 15% and reached 30% in some sectors, that would create great opportunities for
people to recover or to lose; and 3) the relative weakness of internal labor markets in China, in which
firms place employees through less formal hiring systems and modes of wage setting than in firms in
more developed economies.
Bottom line, the Chinese labor market has responded about as well as one could expect to the
huge changes in supply and demand that impacted it in the period under study.

Note: In Panel A, starting or 1st year earnings are relative earnings, indicating to what extent the
earnings exceed the time trend, equal to the gap between actual starting/1st year earnings and the
predicted ones from time trend, in percent. In Panel B, starting or 1st year occupation is the percentage
of employees starting in good occupation in excess of time trend, equal to actual percentage minus the
predicted value in percent.
