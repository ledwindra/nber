Adjustment and Limited Borrowing:

A Welfare Analysis of Policies to Achieve External Balance

ABSTRACT

This paper develops an analytical framework for the analysis of adjustment to
adverse shocks in the presence of limited access to the international credit market.

We consider an economy producing traded and non-traded goods and experiencing a

permanent, unanticipated drop in the availability of external resources. A direct
effect of the shock is that previous consumption and production patterns are not
feasible any more, and the economy consequently must undergo an adjustment that

will allow it to regain its external balance. We introduce several frictions in the
form of time-dependent reallocation costs and nominal labor contracts. We assess the

welfare consequences of restricted access to the capital market by comparing the
welfare loss induced by the drop in income between the cases of credit rationing and
perfect access to international credit. Our analysis demonstrates that restricted

borrowing has three effects -- the intertemporal cost; the contemporaneous
reallocation cost and the dead—weight loss in the labor market. Restricted access to
international capital markets requires a greater real depreciation, implying 9reater
reallocation of resources and consequently greater loss of output in the short run.

Access to the capital market will require smaller contemporaneous reallocation,
allowing partial postponement of the adjustment to the future, when It will be
associated with lower costs. In general, these costs can have first order effect. With
nominal wage contracts we will observe potential losses in the labor market due to
nominal rigidities. These effects can be (at least partially) overcome by optimal

devaluation. Our analysis demonstrates that the effect of limited access to
international credit is to Increase the welfare loss due to nominal contracts,
consequently necessitating a larger devaluation. We conclude that capital flows and
credit assistance can have substantial benefits in reducing the welfare cost of
adjustment to adverse real shocks.

Most developing countries nave experienced significant (adverse) external shocks

the 1980s. Decline in international transfers, increases in external interest

payments anddeterioration of terms of trade have required painful policy decisions
in

order to reach external balance.

The issue of whether less costly adjustment paths can be identified has arisen.

i.e. , can we identify a more optimal sequencing of policies to achieve external
baLance. Should the country quickly apply switching

policies such as a devaluation?

Should the policy maker also quickly initiate contractional policies to reflect the
drop

real income? Or should one postpone or slow the pace

The intertemporal cost reflects the

change in

borrowing. The second effect corresponds to the intertemporal reallocation effects of
the change in time path of the output of non traded goods.1

The contemporaneous reallocation cost accounts for the

requires

a greater real depreciation, implying greater reallocation of resources and

-42. THE MODEL

in

this section we outline the building blocks of the model. These building blocks

contain a specification of the supply of output and the equilibrium in the goods, labor

and the capital market.

Before turning to the formal analysis It Is instructive to review the economics of
of the shock is
adjustment to an unanticipated adverse income shock. The consequence
that

the economy must undergo a structural adjustment that will raise the size of the

traded sector. The presence of time dependent re-allocation costs Is reflected In the
assumption that Labor is fully mobile only In the long run. In the short run, however,

mobility of Labor is costly and there are effective
reallocation.

limits to the attainable

The key feature determining the cost of moving labor is the planning

time that has been available before the move. Figure One plots a sketch of the
mar9inal costs in such an economy. In the long-run, complete mobility of Inputs
allows expansion of output at a constant mar9inat cost. In the short—run, mobility is

costly

and limited. The planned output for time t is denoted by _1X. The short-run

marginal cost schedule is given by schedule SS, intersecting the long-run schedule at

the planned emplojment level. Access to the international credit market may play an
important

role in determining the cost of adjustment. The consequence of the drop in

income is that we should produce more traded goods to replace the drop In external
income. Access to the international capital market allows us to replace some of the

drop in income in

the transition with international borrowing, paying for the

borrowing in the long-run. The absence of such access will imply
adjustment of production

a greater

access. Thus, access to the capital market will allow intertemporal substitution of

credit market.

2.1 OUTPUT
The formulation of the production function is guided by the notion of the presence
labor reallocation costs. For simplicity of exposition we consider

of

here the extreme version of such
the

a framework - the case of a Ricardian model where

cost of moving labor today is zero if the reallocation has been anticipated

yesterday, but is a concave function if

the reallocation

is unanticipated. A simple

way to capture this notion Is by postulating a time dependent production function,
where in the lonQ run output is given by

where L corresponds to employment of labor, and c represents the rewards to
entrepreneurial

skills,

The case of c = 0 corresponds

to a Ricardlan technology. As In

any Ricardian model, the model abstract from the process of investment in productive

contemporaneous costs of moving labor. Henceforth we denote EtIELt] by _1L
Throughout our discussion we will choose functional forms for the supply and demand
that will yield simple expressions for the percentage changes around the initial
equilibrium .

For example, this concern motivates the choice of the normalization of

the adjustment costs in equation

(Ib). The formulation of (Ib) corresponds to the case

where it takes one period to reach the long run, where the planed employment equals

realized one. This formulation can be extended

alternatively international transfers. For simplicity of exposition, we assume that
the initial equilibrium is characterized by a balanced current account where net

equilibrium where each period has equal weights.

We next examine the adjustment pattern

to an unanticipated permanent drop

for the case of a flexible labor market.

3.1 THE LONG-RUN EQUILIBRIUM

The initial long—run equilibrium has a simple representation at Figure Four. The
presence of transfers 2 implies a wedge between aggregate output and consumption

opportunities. Let curve N1T1 be the long—run production frontier, Consumption

3.2 THE SHORT RUN EQUILIBRIUM

The short-run equilibrium Is characterized by limited labor mobility, as reflected
in the short-run production frontier P15T5

.

In 9eneral, we should distinguish between

two possible equilibria. If the shock to Z or if the reallocation cost (ii) are
relatively small, we will observe an internal equilibrium where production Is at a
. Otherwise, we will observe a corner solution where production Is at

point like
a point on

the vertical portion

of the short-run transformation curve. Henceforth we

assume an internal solution. The location of the production and the consumption
points will be shown to be determined by the access to international borrowing.

Figure Five describes the dependency of the short-run adjustment on the access to

international credit. In the absence of access to the international capital market,

production and consumption

will occur at point

.Access to international

credit

enables equilibrium where production and consumption are at points X and C'
respectively.

The horizontal distance between the two points equals the borrowing.

The dotted curve plots the consumption points obtained for different interest rates. A
lower interest rate (due to a higher financial integration. i.e. a higher r) is
associated

with a consumption point that is farther from the 'credit autarky' point,

)( The higher borrowing associated with the higher access to the international
capital market has the consequence of reducing the needed production of traded

output, allowing thereby a higher production of non-traded and a lower real
depreciation. We turn now for a formal derivation of these results.
Let us denote by lower case letters the percentage change in a variable relative

Several observations are In order. Consider the case where there is a permanent

drop in transfers, (z < 0). This drop Is associated with a net drop in the demand for

non-traded goods. Because in the short run we have limited substitutability in the
production side, equilibrium requires a drop

in

the relative price of

non-traded goods

(see (20)). The needed relative price adjustment is larger the lower the sectorlal

Note that the substitutability in production goes up over time.

Consequently, the resultant drop in output in the short—run exceeds the long—run and

consumption smoothing calls for present borrowing of 'rF' (see (19)). The Induced
change in the consumption real interest rate is the sum of E

+ ocq. Consequently, the

balance between two opposing forces (see 21). The first effect corresponds to the
direct effect of a rise In the interest rate (measured in traded goods, r) induced

new borrowing. The second effect corresponds to the intertemporal reallocation

effects of the change in relative prices. Because the drop in the price of non-traded

goods is transitory, it works to reduce the (consumption) real interest rate. The net
change in

the real interest rate is determined by

the sum of these two effects, as can

be seen from (21). With perfect access to international credit (v = oo),

only

the

second effect is observed, whereas in the presence of credit rationing the first effect

We turn now to an assessment of the welfare effects of limited access to
international credit. To do so we apply a modified Harberger's triangles
the

analysis for

assessment of the welfare Loss due to restricted access to international credit.

We apply the analysis for the case where the policy maker intends to service the
debt fully. This allows us to treat

the welfare Loss due to limited access to

international credit as equivalent to the loss due toa borrowing tax levied by the
creditors on the borrowing nation.7 Using the initial

long-run equilibrium as the

The

channel operates via relative prices. The consumption real

expected future real appreciation. The effect of

rationing is to cause greater current real depreciation Inducing thereby a

higher expected future appreciation and consequently a lower real Interest rate (see
(4). (15). (22)).

These two effects operate in opposite directions, and the net change

in the real interest rate is determined by the balance between these two forces. The

Our previous

discussion assumed away the presence of nominal rigidities In the

short run. Consequently, the discussion was conducted in a real model, and there was

no active role for nominal exchange-rate policies. The purpose of this section is to

extend the analysis to the case where due to transaction cost considerations we
observe in the short run nominal contracts in the labor market. Consider the case
where there are one-period contracts that pre-set the wage at its expected market
clearing level. Actual employment is assumed to be demand determined, implying that

A comparison between the loss with a flexible labor market (23) and the present loss

reveals that the only difference Is the addition of the last term In (23'), reflecting
the dead-weight loss in the labor market. This loss is quadratic in the discrepancy
between the actual and the equilibrium real wage. As was shown in section 3.2, the
equilibrium real wages stag Intact (see equations 10, ii). Consequently, the loss in

the labor market is proportional to the square of the change in real wages, given by

6. CONCLUDING REMARKS

This

paper has demonstrated that time-dependent reallocation costs may play an

important role In explaining the welfare costs of credit rationing in the presence of

adverse

real shocks. While there ls no wag to escape the need for structural

adjustment to real shocks, the desired speed of adjustment is determined by the
nature of the reallocation costs. Whenever the reallocation costs are

negatively

related to the planning time that has been available before the movements of factors,
there is an important role for credit assistance in

reallocation process. In

reducing the resources lost In

the

the absence of credit assistance we will observe much

larger changes In relative prices and a greater drop In welfare due to a greater
reallocation of resources in the short-run, when such an adjustment is more costly. It
Is noteworthy that this effect occurs in addition to the more standard losses induced

by restricted access to international credit. Unlike typical deadweight tosses that

frequently are of a second order of magnitude, the loss due to time-dependent
reallocation costs can be of a first-order magnitude. This will be the case, for
example, if the reallocation costs are proportional to the size of the reallocation. In

such a case the reallocation costs are of a first order magnitude. and

they are

significant even for small deviations from the initial equilibrium.

The

present paper has used the simplest framework for the derivation of the

various results. This was obtained by simplifying several assumptions that can be
relaxed without affecting the logic of the analysis. We considered a Ricardian
economy, modified by the presence of short-run reallocation costs. Thus, we did not
allow for productive capital or for the role of

Investment. Allowance for investment

will further increase the measure of the welfare loss

induced by

credit rationing

(formally it will increase the size of A1 in equation 23). without affecttn9 the key
results, As Appendix B demonstrates, our analysis can be extended for a general n
periods horizon, generating gradual adjustment and a meaningful distinction between

the short, intermediate, and long runs.
White our model did not consider uncertainty explicitly, it can be extended to a

- 27stochastic

framework. Such an extension may imply that the presence of

time-dependent reallocation costs will increase the welfare costs of volatile
relative prices and real interest rates. This may have important policy implication:

if

developed countries differ from developing countries in having lower adjustment

costs,

then there are benefits in

countries

Another

reallocating risk from developing to developed

that are independent of the attitude towards risk in the various countries.

implication may be related to the desirability of stable real Interest rates.

In our framework the resources spent on reallocation costs are determined (among
other

factors) by the volatility of real income. A scheme that would stabilize the

real interest rate applicable to the existing indebtedness of developing countries
would tend to reduce the magnitude of resources lost due to reallocation costs by
reducing the volatility of real income. A superior scheme might optimally tie the

interest rate on past indebtedness to

volatility of

the terms of trade, further reducing the

real income.

Another relevant observation is that there are economic

and political limits to

the capacity and willingness to follow policies of swift adjustment. Frequently, one

is

left with the notion that there is a trade—off between the planned speed of

adjustment and the probability of accomplishing it. Consequently. credit assistance

during the adjustment can have the beneficial effect of rising the probability of
successful accomplishment1 2

APPENDIX A: THE LOSS FUNCTION
The purpose of this Appendix is to review the derivation of the loss function that
underlies our discussion. We do it

by considering an economy where the policy maker

intends to service the debt fully. This allows us to treat the welfare loss due to
limited capital mobility as equivalent to the loss due to a rise in the real interest

rate facing the country. We account for the presence of a nominal contract by
allowing a wedge between the supply price of labor (i.e.

w5 as measured along the

supply of labor) and the demand price of labor, which is the observable wage w. In
deriving the loss function we make use of techniques applied previously in Svensson

and Razin (1983), Aizenman and Frenkel

(1985) and Edwards and von Wijnbergen

(1986).

The third, fourth, and fifth terms measure the change In welfare due to chan9es in

employment. The third term measures the distortive effects of nominal contracts,
given by the distortion wedge between the market real wage and the supply price of

labor, times the change in

employment.

The last two terms measure the changes in

profits resulting from costly reallocation of labor.

We start by considering the case of a flexible labor market. We obtain an
approximation for the welfare loss around the flexible equilibrium by integrating the

last expression in (AT) along a path changing p from p0 to its new level, changing
employment from _1L1 to L1 and recalling that in the absence of nominal contracts
the third term in (A7') is zero. In applying this procedure we assume the absence of

cross effects, yielding that

APPENDIX B: A THREE PERIODS ANALYSIS

The purpose of this Appendix is to describe the operation of our analysis In a
three—periods case. This is done in order to demonstrate that the framework evaluated
in the paper is not restricted to two periods analysis. In fact, one

can extend It to a

general n-periods model following a process similar to the one applied in this
Appendix.

Consider a three periods world, where we start with an initial

long-run

equilibrium, denoted by zero. An unanticipated shock occurs at period one. We
identify period one with the short—run, period two with the intermediate—run, and
period three with the new long-run equilibrium. A production process that fits such
an economy is given by:

112

The economics of the production function are the same as described in the text
for (ib), where the reallocation costs are higher the shorter the planning horizon. In

the long run these costs are zero, where in terms of equation (BI) the long run is

reached after two periods. These costs are higher in the short—run than in the
intermediate—run, as is reflected in the assumption that 0 <

equilibrium

Implies

that starting from a long—run equilibrium in period zero the

changes in employment in periods one and two can be approximated by:

where the lowercase letters denote (as in the paper) the percentage change in a
variable relative to Its pre-shock, initial value. Note that a given change In the real

wage will result in a smaller labor reallocation in the short—run than in the

- 34intermediate—run.

The first—period wealth of consumers in terms of the CPI price index (denoted by

Applying the assumption that adjustment costs are tower when adjustment has been

we can show that:

Consequently, there Is an intertemporal trade—off between price and quantities

adjustment. The shorter the run, the greater the change In relative prices and the
smaller the adjustment of quantities. Applying a similar procedure to the analysis in

the paper, one can complete the description of the adjustment In this more general
case. The main results reported in the text are applicable for the general case, where

the speed of adjustment over time is now determined by the time profile of

FOOTNOTES

1. On the economic consequences of non—traded goods see Bruno (1976), Martin 'and

Selowskg (1981), Oornbusch (1983). Aizenman (1985). Aizenman and Frenkel (1986).

For the effects of relative price adjustment on the demand for adjustment finance,
see Martin and Selowskg (1985).

2. From (Ib) it follows that the horizontal distance between points A and B
(Figure Two) is C/1+211(_jLt) - 1)1 (_1L r) and the horizontal distance between
points B and C Is 1/ (_iLt Ti). Consequently. points A and C converge towards point B
as 11 -' oo• Capital can be added without changing the keg results of our analysis. The

presence of investment will be reflected in an extra term in the welfare loss of
limited access to international credit.

3. Note that 1/Ti is a useful measure of the convexity of the production frontier,
being equal to the short—run elasticity of substitution along the production frontier

(i.e. d log N' XT)/ d log N'

1/11, where XN XT and N' T are the output

and the price of non-traded and the traded goods).

4. The income of the consumer is given by Z +

to net profits ( fl PtNXtN +

+ WtLt where

corresponds

- WtLt). Thus, net income equals the value of

international transfers plus the the domestic output (i.e. Z + t,Nt,N + PtTXtT

where St is the spot exchange rate at time t (being also equal to the domestic price

of traded goods). Equation (4) is obtained by taking a logarithmic approximation of

enough to permit ignoring the consequences of Jensens inequality.

10. We are assuming the same values as in Figure Six ( see footnote 6).

11. It can be shown that (assuming the values specified In footnote 6) with credit

rationing we need an appreciation of 200% to stabilize the real exchange rate, but
with perfect access to international credit an appreciation of 36%. A depreciation of

51% will stabilize the consumption real interest rate in the absence of access to
International credit, whereas an appreciation of 36% wIll accomplish it with perfect

access to International credit. A devaluation of 10.5% will stabilize emploijment in

the presence of credit rationing, whereas a devaluation of 5.8% will accomplish It
with perfect access to international credit.

12. This issue can be addressed successfully in a framework that will analyze

explicitly the
also

role of political and country risk. Unconditional

credit

assistance may

have the adverse effect of postponing the needed adjustment, which may lead

economic agents to attempt to 'roll over' Indebtedness in an attempt to postpone
further adjustment. This observation suggests the need for various conditionality
clauses to enhance adjustment.
