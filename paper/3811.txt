THE REAL EXCHANGE RATE, EXPORTS, AND MANUFACTURING PROFITS:

ABSTRACT

paper

investigates the relationship between

manufacturing profits, exports, and the real exchange rate.

Using Harston's (1990) model of pricing-to-market, we derive a
co-integrated log-linear profits equation that restricts the
long-run relationship among real U.S. manufacturing profits,
domestic sales, the real exchange rate, real unit costs, the U.S.

relative price of output, and foreign sales. We show that the
elasticity of real profits with respect to the real exchange rate
is bounded below by the product of (i) 1 minus the long-run

pass-through coefficient and (ii) the ratio of export revenues to

total profits. Our empirical findings suggest that, even after
taking into account output, costs, and relative prices, real
exchange rate fluctuations have a sizable and statistically

significant influence on real U.S. manufacturing profits. The
framework developed in this paper appears to be of some value in
directing attention towards a heretofore underappreciated channel
through which real exchange rate changes can potentially
influence national savings.

Introduction

In this paper, we investigate the relationship between manufacturing
profits, exports, and the real exchange rate. Traditionally, empirical studies

of aggregate profits (Clark (1986)) focus on the relationship between profits

and product prices, sales, and the cost of production. In fact, it might be
expected that, once such traditional variables are taken into account, there is
little left for the real exchange

rate

to explain, notwithstanding the fact that

real exchange rate fluctuations may be correlated with or contribute to
fluctuations in product prices, sales, and the cost of production. This
conjecture turns out to be wrong, at least in aggregate US manufacturing data
during the floating rate period. In fact,

interpreting

the profits equation to

be derived and estimated below as a co-integrating relationship, we estimate
that,

holding

domestic prices, a permanent

than

relative
10 percent real depreciation results in a greater

constant the volume of domestic sales, unit costs, and

6 percent rise in the real profits of US manufacturers. We demonstrate that

the elasticity of real profits with respect to the real exchange rate is bounded

below by the product of (i) 1 minus the pass-through coefficient and (ii) the
ratio of the dollar value of foreign sales to the dollar value of total profits.

We note that even if dollar revenues from foreign sales are small relative to
total sales, they are likely to be large relative to total profits.
I

If all of a given real depreciation is passed through to foreign currency

prices, dollar profits per unit sold abroad are unchanged, but the volume of
exports rises in response to the decline in the relative foreign currency price
of the US export.

If none of a given real depreciation is passed through to

foreign currency prices, exports rise only at the rate of foreign income growth

multiplied by the foreign income elasticity of demand, but dollar profits per
unit sold abroad rise dollar for dollar with the jump in dollar price of foreign

exchange. Thus, a real depreciation of the dollar should boost the profits of
US manufacturera regardless

of whether pass-through

is complete,

partial, or non-

existent.

Marston (1990) uses this framework to investigate the phenomena of exchange
rate pass-through and pricing-to-market. For example, he demonstrates that if
marginal cost and the demand elasticities are constant, a depreciation of the

exchange rate must result in a complete pass-through to the foreign currency

price, 3logQ/31ogS — -1, leaving the dollar price of exports,
price of domestic sales, bt' unchanged.

and the

If marginal cost is increasing, pass-

through is incomplete, foreign sales rise, and domestic sales fall, as

rise in proportion to the increase in marginal cost.

and

If demand

elasticities are not constant, and markups decline with a rise in product prices,

pass-through is less than complete even with constant marginal cost, and the
dollar price of output sold abroad must rise relative to the domestic price, bt

Our interest is not in pricing behavior, per Se, but rather, in the
relationship between profits and the real exchange rate. As we argued in the
introduction, we would expect a real depreciation to boost the dollar profits
of US manufacturers regardless of whether or not said depreciation is passedthough fully, partially, or not at all. We now derive an equation that can be
used to illustrate this reasoning and that can be investigated empirically.

In

this case, pricing-to-market is complete. Export volume remains unchanged, but
dollar profits from foreign sales, which represent 'y times total profits, rise
in proportion to the rate of depreciation.
Fourth, the elasticity of real profits with respect to a depreciation that

is fully passed-through is given by:

when marginal cost is constant. As summarized above, Marston (1990) shows that
pass-through is complete, and the domestic price remains unchanged, in response
to a nominal depreciation when marginal cost and the elasticity of foreign demand

are constant. It follows that, for this case in which no pricing-to-market takes

place, the channel through which real depreciation boosts profits is through
greater export volumes,

With complete exchange rate pass-through and an

equiproportional decline in the foreign currency price of exports, the percent
rise in exports is given by efdlog(S(/P). From (9) we see that this translates
into a rise in profits of ef(-y -

Fifth, the elasticity of real profits with respect to a depreciation that

is only partially passed-through is easily obtained from (9) and (13). Letting

When pass-through is incomplete, a real, exchange rate depreciation boosts profits

through two channels. The rise in the dollar price of exports boosts profits
by i(l - M)dlog(St/Pht) percent, while the rise in export volumes boosts profits
by pe1(1 -

Given the money wage W and constant marginal coat, the optimal response
of a price setting exporter to a depreciation of the dollar is to let the foreign

price alone absorb the impact of the depreciation.

such as monetary policy -

Of course, the same factors

contribute to the dollar depreciation may

ultimately result in a rise in money wages. If this rise occurs, and there is
no subsequent "correctionTM in the value of the dollar, both domestic and foreign

currency prices of exportables will rise in tandem with the increase in domestic
wages.

Indeed, if wages rise ultimately by the initial tall in the dollar's

value the initial decline in foreign currency prices is completely reversed, and
it is easy to show that the long run elasticity of real profits with respect to

a real depreciation is unity. Of course, if the domestic price level rises in
proportion to the nominal depreciation, the long run real depreciation is zero
as is the ultimate change in real profits.

This being said, a depreciation of the dollar that does not ultimately
result in an equal jump in wages will in general boost the real profits of US
exporters. We now turn to an investigation of the empirical relationship between

the real exchange rate and the real profits of US manufacturers in the floating
rate period.

Our empirical strategy is as follows. Suspecting that many, if not all

of the variables under study are non-stationary in levels, we first perform
Dickey-Fuller (1981) tests of the null hypothesis that each variable included

in (15) is in fact 1(1). Under the identifying assumption that
unobservable shocks to variable and fixed costs, and

and

the

the error in measuring

variable cost, are stationary, a finding that alL of the variables under study

are in fact 1(1) would imply that the profits equation (18) represents a co-

integrating equation, an equation that defines the "long run" equilibrium
relationship among profits, sales, exports, product prices, and the real exchange

rate, The null hypothesis that (18) does not represent a co-integrating equation
is tested using the approach suggested by Cranger and Engle (1987). If this null

hypothesis of no-cointegration is rejected, OLS can be used to provide a
consistent estimate of the co-integrating vector, while Phillips-Loretan Non-

Linear Least Squares (1991) can be used to provide an unbiased estimate with
asymptotically correct standard errors,

Given an estimate of the co-integrating vector, the product of the
parameters y and (I - p) is identified.

However, the co-integrating vector

corresponding to the profits equation (18) does not identify the pass-through
coefficient p.

Note that when pass-through is complete, p — 1, the theory

predicts that the coefficient on the log real exchange rate s +

q

-

is

zero.

In this case, a real depreciation can only boost profits by increasing exports,

since the dollar price of exports remains unchanged. Thus, although p is in
general not identified from the profits equation, it is possible to test the
null hypothesis that pass-through is complete.

in Table 1.

There is no decisive evidence against the null hypothesis that each

variable under study is non-stationary in levels, although in the case of real

profits, production sold domestically, and the relative domestic price the t-

ratios

are sufficiently large so as to indicate at least some evidence against

the null. We proceed under the assumption that all of the variables are 1(1).

just a

t-test on the coefficient 6; the appropriate critical values

are those reported in Phillips and Ouliaris (1989). The results for equation

(18), the specification that imposes the first-order condition (16), are
presented in Table 2.
As can be seen in the Table, the null hypothesis of no co-integration among

real profits, domestic sales, the real exchange rate, real unit costs, the
relative price of output, and exports can be rejected at the 5.0 percent level.

This finding is important, because it means that it is possible to recover the
"long nm relationship among these variables without the necessity of specifying

the

short-run dynamics. Note that according to our

specification, these dynamics arise from stationary shocks to costs. Mother
interpretation that is consistent with the finding of co-integration is that
the profit dynamics arise from sluggish adjustment of prices to real exchange

rate changes, domestic demand, or costs. According to this error correction"
interpretation,

a finding of

co-integration implies that sluggish price

induces a dynamic adjustment of real profits that is stationary about

a long run equilibrium described by equation (18).
The finding of co-integration also implies that an OLS regression of real
manufacturing profits on domestic sales, the real exchange rate, real unit costs,

the relative price., of output, and manufacturing exports is not a spurious
regression in the sense of Granger and Newbold (1974). Tn fact, Stock proves

To estimate the parameters of the co-integrating vector, and to perform

hypotheses

tests, we employ the non-linear least squares approach of Phillips

and Loretan (1991),
Phillips and Loretan (1991) propose a parametric procedure for estimating
the co-integrating vector in an equation in which the variables are in fact known

to be co-integrated. The Phillips and Loretan approach tackles the simultaneity

problem by including lagged and lead values of the change in the regressors.
The approach deals with the autocorrelation in the residuals by including lagged

values of the stationary deviation from the co-integrating relationship.
Phillips and Loretan prove that the estimates of the co-integrating vector
obtained from this approach are asymptotically FIML. They also show that the

which is statistically significant from 0 at the 5 percent level. This implies
that the long run elasticity of real profits with respect to a real depreciation

of the dollar is bounded below by 0.57. This estimate represents a lower bound
because it ignores the pass-through of the real depreciation to foreign currency

prices and the resulting rise in export volumes. According to the theoretical
model, it is possible to test the hypothesis that, in the long run, pass-through

elasticity of real profits with respect to domestic sales in excess of 1 seems
large. A point estimate of fl5 —

5. Assessments and Conclusions

What are we to make of these results? Our findings
after

taking

suggest that,

even

into account output, costs, and relative prices, real exchange rate

fluctuations have a sizable and statistically significant influence on US
manufacturing profits, a finding that is consistent with the version of Marston's

(1990) model of pricing to market derived in this paper. Theoretically, the
eLasticity of real profits with respect to the real exchange rate is bounded
below by the product of Ci) 1 minus the pass-through coefficient and (ii) the

ratio of export revenues to total profits. By contrast, we find that, after
taking into account domestically sold output, costs, relative prices, and the

real exchange rate, fluctuations in export volumes have a statistically

14

insignificant influence on US manufacturing profits.

Taken together, these

finding are not inconsistent with our version of Karston's model of pricing to
market if pass-through is incomplete.
Empirically, real manufacturing profits, domestic sales, unit costs, the
real exchange rate, the US relative price of manufacturing output, and exports
are found to be integrated variables. This fact, along with the profits equation

derived in Section 2, is shown to imply that these variables are co-integrated.
We rejected the hypothesis of no co-integration, and used this result to justify

our estimation and testing of the model with the non-linear least squares
approach suggested by Phillips and Loretan.

The model places two testable

restrictions across the coefficients of the profits equation. We were unable
to reject at the 15 percent level the restriction that the elasticities of real

profits with respect to domestic output and exports sum to unity. We were able
to reject at the 1 percent level the restriction that the elasticities of real
profits with respect to the real exchange rate, real unit costs, and the relative

price of output sum to unity.

Thus, while the framework developed in this paper has been useful in

obtaining an intuitive, co-integrated profits equation that reveals the
significant long-run influence of real exchange rate fluctuations on real US
manufacturing profits, the model underlying the profits equation is sufficiently

well specified so as to be rejected by the data. The source of the rejection

is not the sign or significance of the coefficients, hut rather that three
significant coefficients of the predicted sign fail to sum to unity. From this,
it

would not be unjustified to conclude that this framework is of some value in

directing attention towards a heretofore
exchange

neglected channel through which real

rate changes can potentially influence national savings.

Produci Accounts, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Council of Economic
Mvisers. Tables refer to the NIPA accounts unless otherwise noted. The sample
begins in 1973:2 with the collapse of the Smithsonian Agreement, the advent of

floating rates, and the availability of a real exchange rate series with some

variation. The sample ends in 1989:4 to allow for sufficient leads in the
Phillips-Loretan estimation procedure.
