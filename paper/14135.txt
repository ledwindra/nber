1. Introduction
This note describes some models that may prove useful in thinking about technological change. We think of the technology of an economy as described by a probability
distribution of available costs–in the sense of labor or other resource requirements–
for producing diﬀerent goods. Kortum (1997) calls such a distribution a technology
frontier. An individual producer is characterized by his current cost level–a random
variable drawn from the frontier distribution–and is also subject to a stochastic flow
of new ideas–new cost levels. When he receives a cost idea that is better than the
one he is now producing with he adopts it and this new cost becomes his state. If he
receives a higher cost idea, or no idea at all, his cost state remains unchanged.
The evolution of a technological frontier in this sense can be decribed by an ordinary
diﬀerential equation, the exact form of which depends on the way the flow of incoming
ideas is modeled. We consider two possible formulations. The first is a version of the
basic diﬀerential equation for the technology frontier derived in Eaton and Kortum
( 1999), under the assumption that the arrival of new ideas is stochastic, described
1

by a Poisson process. In the second version, the arrival of new ideas in deterministic.
In both cases, the quality of a new cost idea is modeled as a random variable.
Poisson Idea Arrivals
Consider an economy in which each producer at t has an inherited cost level x
e (the

inverse of TFP, say) drawn from a distribution on R+ characterized by
G(x, t) = Pr{e
x ≥ x}.

(If this distribution has a density, it is −Gx (x, t).) Each producer receives new ideas
from his own economy, characterized by the entire distribution G(x, t), at a Poisson
arrival rate α and also receives ideas ze from an external source, characterized by
H(x, t) = Pr{e
z ≥ x},

at the arrival rate β.
For fixed x, we motivate an ordinary diﬀerential equation for G(x, t) with

G(x, t + h) = G(x, t) × Pr{no lower cost arrives in (t, t + h)}.
We have
Pr{no lower cost arrives in (t, t + h)} = Pr{no ideas arrive in (t, t + h)}
+ Pr{one idea > x arrives from G in (t, t + h)}
+ Pr{one idea > x arrives from H in (t, t + h)}
+ Pr{more than one idea > x arrives in (t, t + h)}
= 1 − αh − βh + αhG(x, t) + βhH(x, t) + o(h)
(where the function o(h) satsfies limh→∞ o(h)/h = 0). Then
G(x, t + h) = G(x, t) [1 − αh − βh + αhG(x, t) + βhH(x, t) + o(h)] .
2

Rearranging, dividing through by h, and letting h → 0 gives
∂ log(G(x, t))
= −α[1 − G(x, t)] − β[1 − H(x, t)].
∂t

(1.1)

Deterministic Idea Arrivals
Now consider a very similar economy in which the internal and external source
distributions G and H have exactly the above interpretations. Again, we fix x and
motivate a diﬀerential equation for G(x, t) by

G(x, t + h) = G(x, t) × Pr{no lower cost arrives in (t, t + h)}.
In this case, we assume that in an interval (t, t + h) a producer gets exactly αh
independent draws from the internal source G and exactly βh draws from the external
source H.
Pr{no lower cost arrives in (t, t + h)} = Pr{all αh ideas from G exceed x}
× Pr{all βh ideas from H exceed x}
= G(x, t)αh H(x, t)βh
Then
G(x, t + h) = G(x, t)G(x, t)αh H(x, t)βh
and it follows that
G(x, t + h) − G(x, t)
G(x, t)αh H(x, t)βh − 1
=
.
G(x, t)h
h
Taking the limits as h → 0, we have
∂ log(G(x, t))
= α log(G(x, t)) + β log(H(x, t)).
∂t

(1.2)

The two equations (1.1) and (1.2) represent two diﬀerent physical realities: They
are not mathematically equivalent, nor is there any reason to expect them to be
3

intimately related. In the rest of this note we develop some of the properties of both
equations. In doing so, we keep in mind the convenience of exponential (or Frechet)
distributions in Eaton-Kortum type trade theory. Section 2 treats equation (1.1)
with an external source only. Section 3 deals with (1.1) with internal sources, and
in general. Section 4 goes over the same ground for equation (1.2). In all cases,
we characterize balanced path solutions completely, and provide conditions on initial
distributions that ensure convergence to balanced path solutions.

2. Poisson Arrivals with an External Idea Source
With α = 0, (1.1) is reduced to
∂ log(G(x, t))
= −β[1 − H(x, t)],
∂t
where H(x, t) is a given source function. We integrate (2.1) to get
Z t
G(x, t) = G(x, 0) exp{−β
[1 − H(x, s)]ds}.

The following examples illustrate some possibilities.
Example 2.1. Rectangular source distribution.

Let 1 − H(x, s) = x/m, 0 ≤ x ≤ m, for some m > 0. Let G(x, 0) be a truncated
exponential with parameter λ :
G(x, 0) = e−λx

if x < m
if x ≥ m

= 0

(That is, the distribution has mass e−λm at x = m.) Then
G(x, t) = 0 for all x ≥ m, t ≥ 0
and for all t, x < m,

Note that mass is piling up near 0; truncation becomes irrelevant. But also note
that
1 dλ
→ 0.
λ dt
A constant source distribution doesn’t work as engine of growth. To get growth, we
need to build it in. We can do this through the arrival rate α(t) or through the source
distribution H.
Example 2.2. A shifting, rectangular source distribution.
In Example 2.1, the technology frontier is always improving, but at a decreasing
rate. We can get sustained growth by introducing an ever-improving source distribition, as follows. Let
1 − H(x, t) = x/m(t) for 0 ≤ x ≤ m(t)
and 0 otherwise, where
m(t) = m0 e−νt .

Let G(x, 0) be a truncated exponential with parameter λ0 :

Example 2.3. Growth in the arrival rate of ideas.
Alternatively, we can get sustained growth by assuming that the rate of arrival of
ideas α (t) grows at a constant rate λ. Consider general stationary external source

Independently of other features of the external source distribution, the asymptotic
distribution of G (x, t) is exponential with parameter −βH 0 (0) .1

3. Poisson Arrivals with an Internal Idea Source

Here we set β = 0 so that (1.1) is reduced to an autonomous equation in G(x, ·):
∂ log(G(x, t))
= −α[1 − G(x, t)].
∂t

(3.1)

We fix x and let y(t) = G(x, t) and y(0) = G(x, 0) = y0 . In this case. (3.1) becomes
dy
= −αy(1 − y),
dt

y(0) = y0 .

The unique solution y : R+ → [0, 1] is
y(t) =

y0 +

y0
αt
e (1

− y0 )

.

(3.2)

In the original notation, the solution is then
G(x, t) =

G(x, 0)
.
G(x, 0) + eαt (1 − G(x, 0))

(3.3)

We ask whether (3.3) has a “balanced growth path,” which is to say whether there
is a function ϕ and a number ν > 0 such that
G(x, t) = ϕ(eνt x)
1

This example is closely related to Proposition 3.2 in Kortum (1997).

7

solves (3.3). If so, then
ϕ(eνt x) =

ϕ(x)
.
ϕ(x) + eαt (1 − ϕ(x))

Diﬀerentiate both sides with respect to t :
ϕ0 (eνt x)νevt x = −

ϕ(x)
αeαt (1 − ϕ(x))
[ϕ(x) +
− ϕ(x))]2
eαt (1

If we choose ν = α, evaluate at t = 0, and cancel we get
1
ϕ0 (x) = − ϕ(x)(1 − ϕ(x)).
x
The solution ϕ : R+ → [0, 1] is
ϕ(x) =

1
1 + φx

(3.4)

where φ is a parameter to be determined. Note that for any value of φ, (3.4) defines
a cdf 1 − ϕ(x) on R+ .We have a one parameter family of balanced growth paths,
depending on the initial condition, analogous to the balanced paths of an Ak growth
model.
[Where has the distribution (3.4) been seen before? The standard logistic distribution has the cdf
ex
1 + ex

F (x) =

If y = log(x) has the distribution ϕ in (3.4), the corresponding cdf for y is
K(y) =

φey
1 + φey

So y = log(xφ ) is a standard logistic random variable. Is this a useful fact?]
We next ask the stability question: Given an initial distribution G(x, 0), when does
lim G(e−αt x, t) =

t→∞

8

1
1 + φx

for some φ > 0 ? From (3.3),
G(e−αt x, 0)
t→∞ G(e−αt x, 0) + eαt (1 − G(e−αt x, 0))
1
= lim
t→∞ 1 + [1/G(e−αt x, 0) − 1] /e−αt

lim G(e−αt x, t) = lim

t→∞

Apply L’Hospital’s rule to get
2

1/G(e−αt x, 0) − 1
1/ [G(e−αt x, 0)] Gx (e−αt x, 0)αe−αt x
=
lim
t→∞
t→∞
e−αt
−αe−αt
= −Gx (0, 0)x

since G(0, 0) = 1. The term −Gx (0, 0) is the density of G(x, 0) at x = 0. We have
proved

Theorem. Suppose the distribution defined by G(x, 0) has a density −Gx (x, 0) with
φ = −Gx (0, 0) < ∞. Then for all x ≥ 0,
lim G(e−αt x, t) =

t→∞

1
.
1 + φx

The asymptotic behavior of G(x, t) is thus determined entirely by the value of the
initial density at 0. The density function corresponding to (3.4) is
φ
.
(1 + φx)2
It does not have a mean. Its mode, φ, is attained at x = 0.
For completeness, we provide the solution to (1.1) in a system with both internal
and external sources. The basic DE in this case is
∂ log(G(x, t))
= −α[1 − G(x, t)] − β[1 − H(x, t)].
∂t
9

Fix x and let y(t) = G(x, t), y(0) = G(x, 0) = y0 , and 1−H(x, t) = u(t). This variable
y satisfies
dy
= −αy(1 − y) − βyu(t),
dt

y(0) = y0 .

(3.5)

As before, we use the change of variable z = y −1 , so that (3.5) is equivalent to

4. Deterministic Arrivals
We turn to the deterministic arrival case described in (1.2). With an external idea
source only, α = 0, (1.2) is reduced to
∂ log(G(x, t))
= β log(H(x, t)).
∂t
where H(x, t) is a given source function. We integrate (4.1) to get
Z t
log(G(x, t)) = log(G(x, 0)) + β
log(H(x, s))ds.

(4.2)

The following examples illustrate some possibilities.
Example 4.1. Suppose G(x, 0) = exp(−λ(0)x) and H(x, t) = exp(−μ(t)x). Then
(4.2) implies
log(G(x, t)) = −λ(0)x − βx

from which it follows that G(x, t) = exp(λ(t)) where
Z t
λ(t) = λ(0) + β

10

With an internal idea source only, β = 0, (1.2) becomes
∂ log(G(x, t))
= α log(G(x, t)).
∂t

(4.3)

The solution is
log(G(x, t)) = log(G(x, 0))eαt .
If G(x, 0) = exp(−λx) then log(G(x, 0)) = −λx, log(G(x, t)) = −λ(t)x, and
λ(t) = λeαt .

(4.4)

Thus exponential distributions are preserved exactly with either external or internal
sources. All exponential distributions with λ(t) given by (4.4) satisfy the balanced
path condition
G(x, t) = ϕ(eνt x)
with ν = α.
We next investigate stability. Under what conditions on the initial distribution
G(x, 0) will it be the case that
¡
¢
lim log G(e−αt x, t) = −λx

t→∞

for some λ > 0? From the solution to (4.3) we have

log(G(e−αt x, t)) = log(G(e−αt x, 0))eαt .
Then

with λ = −Gx (0, 0) > 0. Then for all x ≥ 0,
lim G(e−αt x, t) = −λx.

t→∞

Again, the asymptotic behavior of G(x, t) is determined entirely by the value of
the initial density at 0.
