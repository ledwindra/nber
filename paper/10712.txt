CPI Bias from Supercenters: Does the BLS Know that Wal-Mart Exists

NBER Working Paper No. 10712
August 2004
JEL No. C43, D12, D43
ABSTRACT
Hausman (2003) discusses four sources of bias in the present calculation of the CPI. A "pure price"
index based approach of surveying prices as done by the BLS cannot succeed in solving the
problems of bias. We discuss economic and econometric approaches to measuring the first order bias
effects from outlet substitution bias. We demonstrate the use of scanner data that permits
implementation of techniques that allow the problem to be solved. In contrast, the current BLS
procedure does not treat correctly outlet substitution bias and acts as if Wal-Mart does not exist. Yet,
Wal-Mart offers identical food items at an average price about 15%-25% lower than traditional
supermarkets. The BLS "links out" Wal-Mart's lower prices. We find that a more appropriate
approach to the analysis is to let the choice to shop at Wal-Mart be considered as a "new good" to
consumers when Wal-Mart enters a geographic market. This approach leads to a continuously
updated expenditure weighted average price calculation. We find a significant difference between
our approach and the BLS approach. Our estimates are that the BLS CPI-U food at home inflation
is too high by about 0.32 to 0.42 percentage points, which leads to an upward bias in the estimated
inflation rate of about 15% per year.

CPI Bias from Supercenters: Does the BLS Know that Wal-Mart Exists?

Revised draft, August 12, 20042
I. Introduction
Hausman (2003) discusses four sources of bias in the present calculation of the
CPI. The most often discussed substitution bias is a second order bias while the other
three sources of bias are all first order in their effects: “new good bias”, “quality bias,”
and “outlet substitution bias.” A “pure price” index based approach of surveying prices to
estimate a COLI cannot succeed in solving the three problems of first order bias. Neither
the BLS nor the recent report C. Schultze and C. Mackie, eds., At What Price (AWP,
2002), recognizes that to solve these problems, which have been long known, both
quantity and price data are necessary. We discuss economic and econometric approaches
to measuring the first order bias effects from outlet substitution bias. We demonstrate the
use of scanner data that permits implementation of techniques that allow the problem to
be solved.
Over the past decade, “non-traditional” shopping formats have captured significant
share from “traditional grocery.” P. Little (2004) describes the two categories of
alternative retail outlets as “high-spend” outlets, which are low price, one-stop shopping
destinations, and “low and medium-spend” stores which are mostly convenience stores
that serve a “fill-in” role in between trips to the “high-spend” outlets He includes
supercenters (Wal-Mart, Kmart, Meijer, etc.), warehouse clubs (Sam’s Club, Costco and
BJ’s), and mass merchants (Wal-Mart, Kmart, Target, etc.) as the primary outlets for
these “high-spend” expenditures. 3 Using 2003 data, he estimates that these outlets have
24.8% of food expenditures, with supercenters having 45.6% of the category. Over the

past few years Wal-Mart has become the largest supermarket chain in the U.S. Wal-Mart,
excluding its Sam’s Club, now has supermarket- related revenues approximately 51%
larger than the runner-up Kroger, and larger than Albertsons and Safeway, the third and
fourth largest supermarket chains, combined. Nationwide Wal-Mart has a 14% market
share (in 2003), despite not being in a number of regional markets, and an 18% share
when Sam’s Clubs are included. Within the “medium-low spend” category, Little
estimates convenience stores that also sell gasoline as the fastest growing store type with
85.5% of the 12.4% total share for the category. Little calculates that total traditional
grocery outlets, including conventional supermarkets and superstores (a larger version of
the conventional supermarket), have decreased to a 56.3% dollar share in 2003. He also
forecasts that in 5 years, the “high-spend category” will grow from 24.8% to 31%, with
supercenters comprising 54.8% of the total while traditional grocery outlets decrease from
56.3% to 48.3%. Thus, he expects Wal-Mart to become increasingly important over the
next few years, continuing the trend of change over the past decade.
Wal-Mart began selling food in 1988 and in 2002 because the U.S. largest grocery
chain. Wal-Mart now is larger than Kroger, Albertsons, and Safeway, which are the next
largest supermarket chains. Significant consolidation has occurred in the supermarket
industry, but Wal-Mart continues to grow at a significantly faster rate than these
supermarket chains. The majority of Wal-Mart’s grocery sales arise from its over 1400
(as of April 2004) supercenters which are 180,000 square foot stores that are both
discount stores and grocery stores, although it also has “Neighborhood Market” stores
that are about the size (40,000 sq. feet) of an average supermarket.4 While most of the
stores are in the South and Southwest, Wal-Mart is increasing moving into urban centers
with openings expected in Los Angeles and Chicago, along with other urban centers.4
Over the 10-year period from 1991-2001 margins increased in supermarkets as the
price of food sold at supermarkets grew at approximately twice the rate of the PPI for
3

Sam’s Club is owned by Wal-Mart.
Wal-Mart management has given guidance that it expects to open between 230-240 new supercenters in 2005 for
an increase of about 16%. See Dow Jones, “Factiva,” April 19, 2004. Morgan Stanley reports that Wal-Mart is
seeking 16%-17% growth in supermarket sales compared with 3% industry growth. See M. Wiltamuth and R.
Fariborz, “Food Retail,” June 2004. Wal-Mart has grown at a 16% rate over the past three years.

Wal-Mart has sometimes had difficulty in receiving planning approval for its stores. Currently, Wal-Mart has
either no presence or an extremely limited presence in New England, the New York metro area, California, and the
Pacific Northwest. However, its expansion into new areas has proceeded over the past few years.

food. Over this period the PPI for finished food increased by 13.9% while the CPI for
food at home increased by 27.7%. Various studies have demonstrated that food items at
Wal-Mart are 8%-27% lower priced that at the large supermarket chains, even after
discounts for loyalty card and other special are taken into account.5 After entry by WalMart conventional supermarkets typically decrease their prices (or do not increase them
as much as in non-Wal-Mart markets) because of the increased competition.
Remarkably, the large expansion and continuing expansion of Wal-Mart and other
supercenter food outlets has almost no effect on the BLS calculation of the CPI for food.6
The BLS employs a “linking procedure” that assumes “quality-adjusted” prices at WalMart are exactly equal to prices at conventional supermarkets. Thus, when a Wal-Mart
store replaces, say a Kroger, in the BLS sample of stores from which it collects prices, it
links the lower Wal-Mart price to the higher Kroger price to remove any difference. Even
though packaged food items are physically identical at the two stores, the BLS procedure
does not recognize any price difference between the stores. This procedure is not based
on any empirical study. Rather, it is based on mere assumption. The assumption is
completely inconsistent with actual real world market outcomes where Wal-Mart has
expanded very quickly in markets that it entered. Thus, Wal-Mart and other supercenters
are nowhere in the food CPI so that we find that the BLS does not know that Wal-Mart
“exists” in terms of the estimation of a CPI. We also believe that observed consumer
behavior cannot be explained by the BLS assumption of a compensating “quality
differential.” We specify a theoretical model of consumer behavior that demonstrates this
point below.

II.

Current BLS Procedure
The BLS methodology updates its samples of stores from which it collects prices

periodically. It makes two adjustments. First it updates the products in the market basket
5

A recent December 2003 study by UBS Investment Research found a price gap of 17.3% to 26.2%, “Price Gap
Tightens, Competition Looks Hot Hot Hot.” The previous year UBS found a price gap of 20.8% to 39.1%. For
example for a specified identical market basket UBS finds Wal-Mart supercenters to have an average price 19.1%
less expensive in Tampa and 22.8% less expensive in Las Vegas. In 2002, Salomon Smith Barney estimated the
price gap to be between 5% and 25%. See L. Cartwright, “Empty Baskets, September 12, 2002.
6
When customers shift from conventional supermarkets to Wal-Mart no change occurs in the food CPI. To the
extent that prices at Wal-Mart decrease (or increase) at a different rate than conventional stores, the food CPI will
take account of this change with a lagged effect over time.

that consumers purchase. The BLS also updates the stores at which these purchases are
made. The BLS sometimes takes a very long time to incorporate new products in the
market basket as in the case of cellular telephones, which were not included for 15 years
after their introduction. Hausman (1999) demonstrates the significant bias from the delay
in the introduction of cellular telephone. Cage (1996) describes the current BLS
procedure of the “Continuing Point-of-Purchase Survey” (CPOPS), which provides the
BLS with a sampling frame of outlets visited by urban consumers.7 Approximately 20%
of all sampling units participate in a given year.. In 1999 the BLS began collecting the
CPOPs data using computer assisted telephone interviews (CATI The new procedure,
known as TPOPS, allowed an updated list of commodities in all sample units in each
year, rather than only a 20% rotation per year. While the products can change, note that
the expenditure shares across categories did not change with this procedure. The
expenditure shares are only updated on a considerably less frequent basis since the
CPOPs data does not collect expenditure data or quantity data.
When the BLS collects data, it collects the name and address of the retail
establishment reported by respondents and estimates of the total daily expenditure by
POPS category. The expenditure weights are not used to update the expenditure weights
used in the weighted average of prices, rather they are used in the selection of outlets so
that those outlets with larger expenditure weights receive a greater probability of
selection.8 The use of CATI allows for between 20%-25% of the products and services to
be re-sampled in every sampling unit each year.
TPOPS outlet rotation allows a closer approach to actual consumer shopping
patterns as they change. As more households shop at Wal-Mart, the probability of a WalMart being included in a given market increases. Item rotation also occurs as discussed
above. However, when an identical item is sampled at the new outlet, even if the product
is physically identical to the item sampled in the old outlet, the BLS does not take account
of the lower price. Thus, if a 12 ounce box of Kellogg’s Rice Krispies is purchased at a
Wal-Mart that is newly included to replace a Kroger that has been dropped; the BLS links
7

The following discussion follows Cage (1998) closely.
Note that this procedure may introduce bias because higher priced outlets will have higher expenditure weights
than lower priced outlets in many situations, mainly depending on the expenditure elasticity of the market basket
chosen.

the new lower price to the old higher price so no price change occurs. This linking
procedure creates outlet substitution bias in the estimation of the CPI. In the AWP (2002,
p. 168) discussion of BLS procedures, it is claimed that consumer shopping comprises a
package and that non-monetary benefits exactly balance out the effects of the lower price.
This finding was based on absolutely no empirical evidence whatsoever. The finding is
also completely inconsistent with the real world market facts that expenditures at
supercenters grow quickly when they become available. Indeed, Wal-Mart is now the
largest supermarket chain in the U.S.
This “compensating service effect” explanation is also inconsistent with the
“indirect price effect” that we estimate subsequently, where we find that as expenditure at
superstores increases in a given market, the prices at traditional supermarkets decrease.
For example, after two Wal-Mart supercenters opened in Houston, a nearby Kroger’s
sales dropped 10%, the Kroger store reduced worker hours by 30%-40%, and it decreased
its prices.9 Presumably this price decrease is caused by greater competition. Thus,
consumers demonstrate with their expenditure choice that they prefer lower priced
outlets, and the higher priced supermarket must respond in a competitive manner. The
AWP description of the BLS assumption that markets are in equilibrium is inconsistent
with the real world market data, which find that prices from traditional stores decrease
from the increased competition.
Thus, when a new set of stores are included in the BLS sample, the linking
procedure eliminates all of the price differences. Even though the box of Kellogs Rice
Krispies is identical in all respects, the BLS assumes that the quality of the shopping
experience completely explains the difference in price. Thus, lower prices from increased
expenditure at superstores have no effect on the CPI. In all respects, the BLS assumes
that Wal-Mart does not exist in constructing the CPI.
Reinsdorf (1993) found that food and motor-fuel prices during a two-year overlap
period led to new samples prices being lower by about 1.25% compared to the outgoing
samples. Since sample rotation occurs every 5 years, this finding would create a 0.25%
bias per year. However, Reinsdorf’s quantitative findings have not been totally accepted

P. Callahan and A. Zimmerman (2003) report on these effects. The regional head of Kroger’s stated, “Wal-Mart
made us look at ourselves and reinvent ourselves.”

because of concerns about product quality as well as differences in coverage. The AWP
(2002, p. 176) recommended that the BLS continue its current practice and disregard the
effect of Wal-Mart and other supercenters on prices and price indices.

III. A Utility-Consistent Economic Model of Shopping Destination
The BLS assumes that an exact compensating “quality differential” exists between
shopping at a supercenter store with its lower prices and a conventional supermarket.
Service quality and other factors supposedly allow the BLS to assume that quality
adjusted prices are exactly the same when the BLS links the prices. However, this
assumption is inconsistent with real world market behavior that finds when Wal-Mart
opens a store in a new geographic market, it rapidly gains share while conventional
supermarkets lose share.10 We believe that a better model than the implicit BLS model is
to consider Wal-Mart supercenters as a new choice to consumers. Some consumers find
the choice to be superior while others continue to shop at conventional supermarkets.11
Thus, the arrival of Wal-Mart in a given geographic market is similar to the introduction
of a new good into the geographic market. Hausman (1997, 2003) discusses how new
products should be included in a correct cost of living index (COLI). Here, rather than a
completely new product, e.g. cellular telephones, an existing product is expanded into a
new geographic market. However, the effect on consumers is similar since they now
have increased choice in their shopping trips.
For our economic model we consider the conditional choice of consumers to shop
at either a conventional supermarket or at a lower price, and perhaps lower service
quality, supercenter. For ease of exposition, we use a two-stage choice model in which at
the lower stage the consumer considers his or her shopping behavior conditional on type
of store. The consumer calculates a price index for shopping at either type of store, takes
10

Supermarket chains sometimes exit a geographic market after Wal-Mart enters. Albertsons exited the Houston
market after Wal-Mart entry. However, in our model we assume that consumers continue to have access to
traditional supermarkets, even if a given chain exits the market.
11
As we discussed above, these conventional supermarkets typically decrease price because of the increased
competition from Wal-Mart. If the BLS consistently applied its “quality adjustment” procedure it would ignore
these price decreases at conventional supermarkets because presumably they arise from reduced service quality.
However, the BLS fully incorporates these price decreases, demonstrating that its approach is based on no correct
economic assumptions.

account of service and other quality differences, and then at the upper stage decides
which type of store to shop at.12 We use the two-stage approach of Hausman (1985) and
Hausman, Leonard and McFadden (1995), although neither of the models was designed
precisely for the situation of shopping destination choice.
We allow for consumers choice of shopping at either a conventional supermarket,
j=1, or at a supercenter, j=2. Conditional on choosing to shop at one of these two types of
stores the consumer has a conditional expenditure function
y = e( p 0, p1 , p 2 ,..., p n ; u ) = e( p, u ) solves min ∑ pi xi such that u ( x) = u

} are the prices of the n goods in the two types of outlets

denoted by the superscript j, and u is the utility level of the consumer.13 The conditional

demand for each type of product, depending on the type of outlet j chosen is:

∂v( p 0 , p j , y )

(3.2)

where the indirect utility function v(p,y) is derived from the duality relationship with the
expenditure function. Using duality corresponding to any level of utility in equation (3.1)
and any vector of prices, a price index exists that corresponds to the minimum
expenditure required to achieve a given level of utility u . Indeed, the utility consistent
price index is the level of expenditure needed to achieve the utility level:
Π ( p j , u ) = e( p j , u ) = y j ( p j , u ) = y j = ∑ p i x i
j

j

12

We assume that consumers do not divide their shopping trips between different types of stores, although this
behavior could be incorporated into the model.
13
As written, equation (3.1) assumes that both types of stores carry all goods. To the extent that supermarkets carry
a wider variety of products that supercenters, the prices for supercenters can be entered as virtual prices that set
demand to zero. See Hausman (1997) for an explanation of virtual prices.

7

An “average price” p j can then be calculated by dividing y j by a quantity index x j so
that y j = p j x j . 14
We now move to the top level where the consumer decides whether to shop at the
conventional supermarket or at the supercenter outlet. We expect y 1 > y 2 because most
prices in supermarkets exceed the prices in supercenters. Consider the use of the
binomial logit model for choice between traditional supermarkets and supercenters.15 The
probability of choosing the traditional supermarket is:

pr ( j = 1) =

1
1 + exp( β 0 + β 1 ( p 1 − p 2 ))

(3.4)

where a log price index or other type of price index (e.g. a Stone price index) can also be
used depending on the precise form of the underlying expenditure (utility) and demand
functions in equation (3.1) and (3.2).16
If we can assume that the overall units of a good are the same, e.g. Kellogg’s Rice
Krispies, we can simplify so that the overall demand for good i becomes:
xˆ i ( p 0 , p 1 , p 2 , y ) = pr ( j = 1) xi ( p 0 , p 1 , y ) + pr ( j = 2) xi ( p 0 , p 2 , y ) (3.5)

where the right hand side demands are the conditional demands from equation (3.2) and
have common units. Similarly, to calculate the unconditional price for the representative
consumer we take overall expenditure on good i and divide by the quantity of equation
(3.5):
pˆ i ( p 0 , p 1 , p 2 , y ) = Ξ i ( p 0 , p 1 , p 2 , y ) / xˆ i ( p 0 , p 1 , p 2 , y )

14

(3.6)

Instead of the average price we can also divide expenditure by utility to get a “cost of utils” index.
Because of only two choices, the independence of irrelevant alternative assumption does not create a problem
here. With more than two choices a nested logit or multinomial probit model could be used. See Hausman et. al.
(1995) for a derivation with the nested logit model.
16
An exact aggregation approach when using a Gorman generalized polar form appears in Hausman et. al. (1995).
15

8

where Ξ i is expenditure on good i. If choice j = 2 does not exist in a given geographic
market, then the price index of equation (3.6) is just the traditional supermarket price so
that pˆ i ( p 1 , p 2* , y ) = p 1 where p 2* are the virtual prices, which cause demand at
supercenters to be zero.17 But when supercenters become available, consumers who
choose to shop at supercenters do so to maximize their utility and the correct price index
is an expenditure weighted average of the two prices. This expenditure weighted
approach to price averages is the procedure we use in the empirical work that follows.
Thus, the exact cost of living index becomes
P( p0 , p 2 , p 1 , u ) =

y 2 ( p 0 , p 1 , p 2 , u ) e( p 0 , p 1 , p 2 , u )
=
y 1 ( p 0 , p 1 , p 2* , u ) e( p 0 , p 1 , p 2* , u )

(3.7)

which gives the ratio of the required amount of income when supercenters are present in
the market compared to the situation where supercenters are not present and prices are at
the virtual level p 2* , which causes demand to be zero. Equation (3.7) demonstrates how
the new good approach applies to supercenters when the correct unit of observation is a
geographic market, rather than a new product. Taking the appropriate weighted averages
of equation (3.7) leads to an expenditure share weighted approach.
Thus, we do not find support for the BLS assumption of an exact compensating
quality differential when consumers can choose which type of outlet at which to shop.
Some consumers continue to shop at traditional supermarkets when supercenters become
available, while other consumers shift to shopping at supercenters. In terms of the
representative consumer we calculate the probability weights for each type of choice
multiplied by the demand at each type of outlet and divide this weighted demand into
expenditure to derive the price index. As more supercenters become available in a given

17

To the extent that traditional supermarkets close because of increased supercenter competition, consumers have
decreased choice, which could effect price index calculations. However, in the model we assume that consumers
still have the choice to shop at one or more traditional supermarkets, i.e. that not all supermarkets in a given
geographic market close. In this situation which is consistent with actual market outcomes, the effect on a
theoretical price index would be extremely small. Indeed, supermarkets that close typically have the smallest
customer base, which further decreases the effect of store closings on a price index.

9

geographic market, more consumers choose to shop at supercenters and its expenditure
weight increases. We continuously update the expenditure weights to allow for this
observed market determined change in shopping destination choices. Consumers in their
revealed preference choices determine the appropriate weights to be used in the price
index.
We find that Wal-Mart should exist in the estimation of a price index, contrary to
the current BLS procedure. However, note that as Hausman (2003) emphasized, to
implement this approach both prices and quantities need to be available, which
necessitates the use of scanner data. The BLS approach, which only collects price data,
cannot implement the correct price index approach. Without quantity data, the BLS will
always be required to make one or another arbitrary assumption regarding “service
adjusted” quality levels. Observation of actual consumer choice in terms of quantities
purchased allows us to resolve the problem.

IV. Data Description
This study uses a customized subset of the ACNielsen Homescan scanner panel
data for the four years 1998-2001. The ACNielsen Homescan data is a consumer panel
consisting of approximately 61,500 randomly selected households across the U.S. and
includes purchase as well as demographic information for all households in the sample.
Homescan households are randomly recruited to join the panel using sampling techniques
to ensure household representation for demographic variables such as household income,
family composition, education, and household location. Each household is equipped with
an electronic home-scanning unit, and household members record every UPC-coded food
purchase they make by scanning in the UPC of the food products that they buy from all
retail outlets that sell food for home consumption.
The panel is recruited on a permanent basis, subject to turnover from normal
attrition or adjustments to demographic targets necessitated by Census revisions.18 The
Homescan panel is considered by many in the food industry as the most reliable
household based panel data due to its long-standing reputation in the marketplace and its
utilization of hand-held technology that minimizes the recording burden for participants.

10

The ACNielsen Homescan consumer panel collects consumer shopping and purchase
data from all outlet channels, including grocery, drug, mass and convenience stores. The
panel is geographically dispersed and is demographically balanced so the sample profile
matches the US population as closely as possible. The panel data is also projected to
census estimates that are updated regularly to reflect population changes.
Household panel data allows for observation of the ongoing purchase habits and
practices of household and demographic groups. Tracking and analyzing this
information over time can reveal the dynamics of consumer behavior such as who is
buying what products, what different products are purchased during a given shopping
trip, and how often a product is purchased. Panel data quantifies the composition of
category or brand volume which can be used to measure the impact of store choice on the
purchase level of product quantities and prices. Data are collected after each panelist
shopping trip. Members of the panel record their purchases, capturing not only what is
purchased, but also where the purchase was made, and whether the purchase was a
promotional, sale, or coupon item.
These data are useful in price analysis since we are able to observe actual
purchase choices by consumers. However, in terms of food purchase behavior, the key
missing information is consumer purchases of food away from home (primarily
restaurant meals) so one needs to assume that the unknown levels of food away from
home purchases do not somehow bias the average prices paid by an individual household
for their food at home purchases. Once this assumption is made these data are useful for
analysis of the impact of store choice on average prices paid for food at home items.
Consumer panel information can be used to measure the average prices paid by a
representative group of households over time. This measurement of average price paid
can be aggregated across households and/or across time to measure price change for
different categories of products.
Along with the description of each product, the price and quantity that was
purchased is recorded on a daily basis. National and regional level aggregates can be
calculated using transaction data from households located in 50 local U.S. markets as
well as households in non-metro/rural areas that are included in this data set. For 21 of
18

Households lost through attrition are replaced with others having similar key characteristics.

11

these 50 markets, a large enough number of panelists are included to enable comparisons
across markets for all UPC-coded products. 19
The Economic Research Service (ERS) of the USDA purchased a sub-sample of
transaction level data from the Fresh Foods Homescan Panel20 comprised of households
that not only recorded their UPC-coded transactions, but also recorded their randomweight (non-UPC coded) food purchases over the year(s) that they participated in the
panel. This sub-sample was used for this study in order to be able measure the entire
market basket of household purchases of food for at-home consumption21. Of this group
of 15,000 households per year, the sample was restricted to households that participated
in the panel for at least 10 out of 12 months per year22.
Standard demographic information is collected on an annual basis from each
household and each household’s home market/city and census region is identified for
stratification purposes (see below). Each household is then assigned a projection factor
(weight) based on its demographics in order to aggregate the data to be representative at
the market, regional, and national level. 23
These data were constructed based on a stratified random sample with households
as the primary sampling unit. A stratified random sample is used to ensure that the

The Fresh Foods Homescan Panel contained 12,000 households in 1998 and 1999 and was expanded to 15,000
households in 2000 and 2001.
21
If only UPC-coded products were used to measure food-at-home expenditures, many fruit, vegetable, meat, and
poultry purchases would not be recorded in the data and food-at-home expenditure shares by store type would not
accurately measure true household and market expenditure shares. This is especially true in this situation when
alternative channel stores sell less random weight items than conventional retailers. Leaving out random weight
items would then tend to overstate the shares of food expenditures of alternative retail outlets.
22

In total, there were 9,501 unique households in the data with some subset participating each year creating a total
of 28,996 household by year observations. In 1998 there were 7,624 households, 7,124 households in 1999, 7,523
households in 2000, and 8,216 households in 2001. Some households participated in the panel for more than one
year. Of the 9,501 households in the data, 5,247 households participated for all four years, 1,877 households

There was no known or intentional clustering in the sample construction. The projection
factor (weight) reflects the sample design and demographic distribution within the strata.
The information that is captured on a transaction level basis includes: date of
purchase, store name and channel type identifier25, store department identifier26, item
description, brand name, number of units purchased, price paid,
promotions/sales/coupons used (if any). For retail stores that ACNielsen tracks with their
store-level scanner data27, prices are verified through store-level price and promotion
checks.
Warehouse shipment data are used to supplement scanner-generated data
collected from households or provided to ACNielsen through their store-level scanner
data. Warehouse shipment data is used to estimate the balance of sales moving through
other food retailers. This information is Census data (i.e., non-projected, actual shipment
data) supplied to ACNielsen by wholesale co-operators.
Some question the quality of household panel data when they try to reconcile it
with store-level scanner data. There is the perception that the volumetric data from each
source should be the same. However, panel data and store data are not always equal
because measurement methodologies differ. Store-level data records millions of

shopping transactions while panel data records a specific group of shoppers. In addition,
panel data only represents household-based purchases, so there are no small businesses or
other institutional purchases included in the panel.
Both types of information have their uses, and by combining the two, one can
quantify the composition of volume, understand the reasons behind consumer behavior
changes, and measure the impact of store choice on average prices. Store-level scanning
data may show that sales were down in a particular store for some group of products in a
given time period. Panel data provide insight into whether the lost volume is due to
fewer buyers or if the existing buyers purchased less at the given store or chain of stores.
Panel data also provide information on which competitors gained the lost expenditures of
the store in question.

V.

Effects on Prices
Our empirical approach first investigates the effect of supercenters, mass
merchandisers, and club stores, (hereafter SMC) on prices paid by households. Two
effects are present. The direct effect is that as more of these superstores operate in a
given geographic market, the average prices paid by households will decrease. Prices for
food categories in superstores are typically 5%-48% less than prices for the same product
in supermarkets and other conventional retail outlets. Thus, as a high proportion of
households buy their food at non-traditional retail outlets, the average price paid in a
market will decrease.

A. Price Difference between Supermarkets and Superstores
In Table 5.1 we calculate the ratios of average prices across different types of
outlets for 20food categories. Column 2 compares the prices for the food categories in
traditional supermarkets compared to prices for these same categories in SMCs (nontraditional stores).

The largest difference in average price was for lettuce where SMC prices were about
50% lower than traditional supermarkets over the 48 month period. Bottled water was
the lowest price difference with SMC prices about 5% less expensive. Soda was the only
item with a lower price in traditional supermarkets than in SMCs. When we take an
average across all of the food categories we find that SMCs have prices that are 27%
lower than traditional supermarkets. We find this difference to be quite large.28
In column 3 of Table 5.1 we compare the price in all non-SMC outlets, including
traditional supermarkets, to the price of these food categories in superstores. We find the
results to be quite similar with the main differences occurring in soda and bottled water.
We find the same overall results that SMC stores offer significantly lower prices than
other retail outlets.
We do not find any indication that SMC stores change (increase) their prices at a
greater or lower rate than traditional supermarkets and other retail outlets. However, we
cannot do the comparison of price changes in equilibrium because as the presence of
28

The estimated difference is in line with stock analyst reports who have previously sampled the difference in prices

16

SMC stores increases, traditional retail outlets, and most importantly traditional
supermarkets, decrease their prices as a competitive response.

B. Direct and Indirect Effects on Prices from Superstores
Another important effect exists from the expansion of SMC stores. Their
increasing presence also increases competition among traditional food retailers. These
supermarkets must decrease prices to remain competitive. The well-publicized strike in
the Los Angeles area in late 2003 through early 2004 when traditional supermarkets
wanted to decrease health benefit for their employees demonstrates the effect that
potential entry of supercenters can have on competition. We call this SMC effect on
traditional supermarkets the indirect price effect. Both the direct and indirect price
effects lead to lower average prices for households.
To investigate both the direct and indirect effects on average prices, we do an
econometric analysis using the ACNielsen Homescan data. These data are particularly
useful since they provide household data and allow for a stratified random sample of all
households. Importantly they provide both price and quantity data across all stores.
Since Wal-Mart and some other large superstores no longer participate in the IRI or
ACNielsen store level data collection, household data collection provide a source of price
and quantity data that are not available elsewhere.29
We analyze data at the market level using a fixed effects specification with 48
monthly observations for each market during the period 1998-2001:
pit = α i + δ t + βeit + ε it

i = 1, 34 t = 1, 48

(5.1)

where pit is the average log price paid for a given product, α i is a fixed effect for a
market, δ t is a monthly fixed effect, eit is percentage expenditure for a given product in
superstores, and β is thee elasticity coefficient that wee estimate. We use market fixed

over a very few markets.
29 Since the SMC stores continue to collect the data for internal use, we believe that if the BLS were to begin to use
scanner data these large stores would likely allow use of their data under confidentiality restrictions. However, the
household data provide an adequate source of information for most uses.

17

effects rather than random effects because expenditure in SMC stores is unlikely to be
uncorrelated with the stochastic disturbance, e.g. Hausman (1978). In this situation a
fixed effects estimator yields the efficient estimator. However, we make two further
econometric adjustments. First, expenditure in superstores on a given product may well
not be econometrically pre-determined. Thus, we use instrumental variable estimation
(2SLS) where as the instrument we use the overall proportion of food expenditure in
SMC stores in a given market as the instrumental variable. Also, we use an
autoregressive model for the stochastic disturbance (AR1) to capture the time series
aspect of the data and to achieve more efficient estimates. However, least squares with
robust standard errors leads to quite similar results.
For our econometric investigation of 20 food products we use 34 markets, each
with over 12,000 food transactions per year. The 34 markets are listed in Table 5.1:

For each of these markets we standardized purchases on a physical unit measure and
estimated the effect of increasing purchases in SMC stores. Since we have fixed effects
for each market, persistent cost and price differences should be take account of as well as
seasonal effects given the presence of monthly fixed effects. We give the econometric
estimates for these 20 food categories across the 34 markets in Table 5.2:

All of the estimated elasticity coefficients are negative as expected. Thus as households
spend increasing amounts of expenditure at SMCs, the average prices paid for food items
decrease. While the effects are estimated with varying amount of precision, overall the
results are highly significantly different from zero. No obvious pattern of coefficient size
seems to exist: we find the largest effects for ham, lettuce, butter/margarine, tomatoes,
potatoes, and coffee, which are a mix of branded and unbranded products. Yet, we find
relatively small effects for ground beef, apples and bananas, which are typically
unbranded products, but we also find relatively small effects for cereal and yogurt, which
typically are branded products. Overall, we find a statistically negative effect on
average prices as shopping in superstores increases. Thus, we find the “direct effect”
operates as household shift their expenditure from traditional supermarkets to lower
priced superstore outlets.
In Graph 5.1 we depict the difference in average prices paid by households due to
the spread of SMC stores over the period. During the sample period from January 1998
to December 2001 the expenditure share of SMC stores increased from 10.9% to 16.9%,
a 55.3% increase over the 48 months or 11.6% per year. We take the econometric
estimates from Table 5.2 and use them to estimate the decrease in average price for each
food category. We then average across food categories and plot the results in Graph 5.1,
which demonstrates the increasing effect on average food prices as SMCs become more
available and households increase their expenditures at these retail outlets. We find that
food prices are 3.0% lower than otherwise, or an effect of about 0.75% year.

over the 48 month period. The effect on the price of yogurt is presented in Graph 5.3.

Thus, in Graph 5.3 the effect on the average price of yogurt over the 48 month period is –
1.1%. From Graphs 5.2 and 5.3 we see that significantly different price effects exist for
different food products due to the spread of SMCs and increased expenditure at those
SMCs by households.
We now repeat the econometrics to test for the “indirect effect” of lower
conventional supermarket prices because of increased competition from superstores. In
equation (5.1) we replace the left-hand variable pit, which is the average log price paid
p , which is the average price paid in supermarkets. We give

We estimate 18 of the 20 coefficients to be negative, with the only exceptions being
bread and cereal, neither of which is statistically significant.30 As would be expected
from economic theory, the effects of increased SMC expenditures are smaller for most of
the products. Thus, the “direct effect” on average prices paid by household arising from
substitution to lower priced SMCs typically exceeds the “indirect effect” of decreased
prices in supermarkets. Nevertheless, we do find some quite large indirect effects as in
lettuce, butter/margarine, coffee, ice cream, potatoes, tomatoes, and bottled water. The
spread of supercenters leads to lower prices both for households that shift their food
shopping from supermarket to SMC stores but also for households who continue to shop
at supermarkets because of lower prices caused by the increased competition from
expanding food offerings at SMCs.
In terms of one of the questions we posed at the beginning of the paper, the spread
of supercenters does significantly affect prices paid by households. However, to
correctly estimate the effect both quantities and prices must be utilized. Holding prices
fixed as households shift their expenditures to non-traditional retail outlets, we find the
average prices they pay decrease. However, prices also change because as households
shift their purchasing behavior, the increased competition forces supermarkets to lower
their prices. Both of these effects, the direct effect and indirect effect, lead to lower
average prices paid by households for food items.

VI.

Effect on Price Indices
Since our scanner based data set includes observation on both quantity and price,
we are able to construct a price index that takes account of both increased expenditure at
SMC stores as well as the effects of substitution when consumers face lower prices.

30

We find very similar results if we group the remaining Nielsen categories with supermarket: drug stores,
convenience, and “other”. These other outlet categories have relatively low expenditure levels compared to
traditional supermarkets.

24

Thus, we are to consider a source of first order bias in the CPI, outlet substitution bias, as
well as the source of second order bias, substitution bias that occurs with the lower prices
at the SMC outlets.
Food expenditures at SMC outlets have increased over the years in question. In
January 1998, in our sample of 34 markets, we find an expenditure share of 0.1090. At
the end of the sample, 48 months later, in December 2001 we find an expenditure share
of 0.1693. Thus, the expenditure increased by .0603 or by 55.3% over the 48 months or
11.6% per year. The share has continued to increase as new SMC food outlets have
continued to open and as consumers have increasingly shopped at these outlets.
We estimate the effect of this increased expenditure in lower priced SMC outlets
on the 20 food categories we considered above and an overall food price index. We
consider three indices in Table 6.1: (1) Continuous update: a continuously updated,
Divisia-style, price index where aggregates food expenditure shares across outlets from
the current month are used to construct a share weighted average price for each food
category. Note that since we have scanner data we can update both the food expenditure
shares (quantity data) and the price data each month. This continuous updating allows us
to control for both outlet substitution bias, a first order bias in the CPI, and substitution
bias, a second order bias in the CPI. (2) BLS Constant Weights: we keep the expenditure
shares constant over the 48 months. We use current prices each month, but we take a
weighted average using the expenditure weights as of January 1998. Thus, both outlet
substitution bias and price substitution bias are present in the calculated index. (3) BLS
with updated yearly expenditure weights: In January of each year we rotate stores and
link the prices to the preceding December. We are assuming here that the BLS TPOPS
procedure leads to a correctly reweighted sample each year, but that price linking
removes the lower price effect of the shift by consumers to increasing expenditures at
SMCs (4) Biennial Update which is closest to the current BLS procedure. We now
update the expenditure weights across stores based on the previous December. We
continue to use the BLS linking procedure. Thus, we continue to have outlet substitution
bias but we have reduced price substitution bias because of the yearly updates. While we
cannot tell exactly which method BLS used, we believe method (4) is the closest to
current BLS procedures.

In Table 6.1 we see that Method (1), the Continuous Update procedure, almost
always leads to lower price increases or greater price decreases for all food products over
the 48 month period. For example, apples have a price increase estimated at 1.6%.
Method (2) calculates an increase of 2.8%. The difference is 0.12 percentage points or a
difference of 15.0% per year. Method (3), which allows for yearly updated expenditure
weights, calculates an increase of 3.2% per year, 0.16 percentage points more than
Method (1), or a difference of 18.9% per year. Lastly, Method (4), which uses biennial
updates to the weights, again calculates an increase of 3.2% per year or a difference of
18.9% per year. To our initial surprise, while Method (1) finds the lowest price increase
as expected, Method (2) often estimates a lower price increase than Method (3) or
Method (4). However, we now recognize this outcome as the result of the BLS linking

26

procedure that eliminates the effect of the lower prices when customers switch outlets.
Method (2) captures the “indirect effect” of lower prices when the presence of
supercenters increases, but Methods (3) and (4) eliminate part of this indirect effect
because they update the expenditure weights. Thus, the outcome of a more continual
updating of expenditure weights leads to a perverse result because of the “linking out” of
lower prices in SMCs.
When we take average yearly changes across all food categories we find the
estimated difference between Method (1) and Method (2) to be 0.32% a year. This
estimate is the same order of magnitude, but somewhat higher than Reinsdorf’s (1993)
estimate. In terms of the BLS CPI-U for food at home which averaged 2.29% over this
period, the 0.32% per year difference is 14.0%. Thus, we estimate that the Method (2)
has an upward bias of approximately 14.0% because of its linking procedure, which
eliminates the effect of households shifting their expenditure to lower price supercenter
outlets such as Wal-Mart.
We next compare Method (1) to Method (3), which allows for updated
expenditure weights each year. Here we find an estimated difference between Method
(1) and Method (3) of increase of about 0.36% per year. We find an upward bias in the
Method (3) measure of food at home to be upward biased by 15.7%. If we compare
Method (4), the biennial update method, we find the estimated average difference to be
0.42% per year. In terms of Method (4), which is probably most similar to the
calculation of the BLS CPI-U for food at home, the 0.42% per year difference is 18.3%.
The years 1998-2001 were generally a period of low inflation, but we still find significant
difference in estimates of the food price indices dues to shift towards lower price outlets.
We find an upward bias in the range of 14.0% to 18.3% in the estimate of the CPI for
food at home because of the use of the BLS linking procedure. Thus, updating the
expenditure weights significantly reduces the bias in the estimated price index
In Graph 6.1 we plot the Method (1) price index where January 1998 is set equal
to 1.0. Over the entire period we estimate a price increase of 12.1% or 2.5% per year.

2.29% per year. The estimates are quite comparable, but the CPI-U index is over a much
wider range of food products than the index we have computed. We intend to widen the
range of food categories we for which estimate the effects of shifts to lower price outlets
in future versions of this paper.

Conclusion
Over the past 15 years the largest development in food retailing has been the start

of Wal-Mart supercenters that compete most closely with traditional supermarkets. WalMart has expanded greatly, mostly in the South and Southwest, and become the largest
supermarket chain in the U.S. Wal-Mart is now expanding into additional geographic
markets in California and the upper Midwest, so its effects will become even more

important.31 Wal-Mart offers identical food items at an average price about 15%-25%
lower than traditional supermarkets. Wal-Mart’s entry into a new geographic market
creates a direct price effect by offering a lower price option to consumers and an indirect
price effect by causing traditional supermarkets to lower their prices because of the
increased competition.
The BLS procedure currently does not take account of the lower price option that
Wal-Mart offers when it enters and expands in a given geographic market. The BLS only
captures the indirect price effect. Instead, the BLS “links out” Wal-Mart’s lower prices
by assuming that an exact “compensating service quality differential” exists that exactly
counteracts Wal-Mart’s lower prices. If this assumption were correct, we would not see
the rapid gain in market share by Wal-Mart after its entry into a market.
We find that a more appropriate approach to the analysis is to let the choice to
shop at Wal-Mart be considered as a “new good” to consumers when Wal-Mart enters a
geographic market. Some consumers continue to shop at traditional supermarkets while
other consumers choose to shop at Wal-Mart. For the representative consumer we take a
utility-consistent probability weighted average of the choice of shopping destination.32
This approach leads to a continuously updated expenditure weighted average price
calculation, which we apply to food data in 34 markets over a 48 month period.
However, this approach requires quantity data as well as price data, so the BLS would
need to begin to use scanner data to implement our approach. Currently the BLS collects
only price data, but does not collect quantity (or expenditure) data that it incorporates
into the CPI except at lengthy intervals.
We find a significant difference between our approach and the BLS approach,
even for the relatively low food inflation period of 1998-2001 that we study in this paper.
Our estimates are that the BLS CPI-U food at home inflation is too high by about 0.32 to
0.42 percentage points, which leads to an upward bias in the estimated inflation rate of
about 15% per year. We intend to expand our approach to more food categories in
further research, but we find that the BLS should take account of Wal-Mart and other
non-traditional retail outlets, rather than making believe that Wal-Mart does not exist.

Wal-Mart has announced plans to open 40 supercenters in California in the next 3-5 years, Wiltamuth op. cit.
The BLS approach assumes that consumers are not made better off by an expanded choice set, contrary to almost
