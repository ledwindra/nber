Financial Frictions and the Rule of Law
Ashantha Ranasinghe and Diego Restuccia
NBER Working Paper No. 24546
April 2018
JEL No. O1,O11,O4,O43,O5
ABSTRACT
Using cross-country micro establishment-level data we document that crime and lack of access to
finance are two major obstacles to business operation in poor and developing countries. Using an
otherwise standard model of production heterogeneity that integrates institutional differences in
the degree of financial development and the rule of law, we quantify the effects of these
institutions on aggregate outcomes and economic development. The model accounts for the
patterns across establishments in access to finance and crime as obstacles to their operation.
Weaker financial development and rule of law have substantial negative effects on aggregate
output, reducing output per capita by 50 percent. Weak rule-of-law institutions substantially
amplify the negative impact of financial frictions. While financial markets are crucial for
development, an essential precondition to reap the gains from financial liberalization is that
property rights are secure.

Introduction

Understanding the causes of cross-country income differences is a fundamental question in the
macro-development literature. Recent work has emphasized that the allocation of resources
across heterogeneous establishments is important for understanding cross-country productivity differences (Restuccia and Rogerson, 2008; Hsieh and Klenow, 2009; Bartelsman et al.,
2013).1 What are the frictions, policies, and institutions that create factor misallocation
and hence reduce aggregate productivity in poor countries? In this paper, we focus on two
institutions that are empirically relevant for business operation in poor countries: financial
market development affecting access to credit and the rule of law affecting the potential for
crime. These institutions create idiosyncratic effects across establishments since heterogeneous producers are affected differently by them. We evaluate the quantitative relevance
of institutional differences in financial development and the rule of law in accounting for
resource misallocation and aggregate income differences across countries.
Our focus on the rule of law and financial development as key institutional features is
motivated by their importance for development as highlighted across separate strands in the
literature, (e.g. King and Levine, 1993; Rajan and Zingales, 1998; Shleifer and Vishny, 1998;
Svensson, 1998). The rule of law and financial development are closely linked to crime and
access to credit, two highly relevant distortions in developing countries. While the importance
of access to finance is well documented in the literature, less known is the prevalence of
establishment-level crime across countries. We document that crime is a prevalent and severe
obstacle to business operation in developing countries, at least as prevalent as the lack of
access to finance across a host of countries in several sub-continents. For instance, using data
from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys (WBES), we find that in South America 34 percent
of establishments report crime as a major obstacle to business operation, whereas 23 percent
of establishments report access to finance as a major obstacle. The corresponding percent of

establishments in Africa reporting crime and finance as major obstacles to business operation
are 26 and 41 percent. To provide context, in a developed country such as Germany, less
than 5 percent of establishments report crime as a major obstacle to business operation and
15 percent report access to finance as a major obstacle.2
To study the quantitative importance of institutional differences in the rule of law and
financial development, we consider a unified framework whereby differences in the rule of
law affect the potential for crime at the establishment level and differences in financial market development restricts establishment access to credit. The model is a variant of Lucas
(1978) span-of-control framework. Individuals differ along entrepreneurial productivity and
asset holdings, and choose either to operate an establishment as an entrepreneur or supply
labor as a worker. Two market imperfections are central to our analysis. First, economies
differ along financial market development, which is modelled as an endogenous collateral
constraint that restricts access to finance and is proportional to entrepreneur asset holdings.
Entrepreneurs in less developed financial markets face a more stringent collateral constraint
(financial frictions). Second, economies differ in the strength of the rule of law which affects
the potential for crime. We model crime as the proportion of capital that is expropriated from
an entrepreneur post-production, an outcome determined within the model. The potential
for crime is inversely related to the rule of law and how much protection an entrepreneur
is able to purchase. Differences in the rule of law and financial market development affect
occupational choices and the scale operation of entrepreneurs, generating effects on aggregate productivity and output. Moreover, as we elaborate below, these institutions have the
potential to amplify the effects arising from crime or access to finance individually. Our goal
is to quantify these effects and assess their implications for cross-country income differences.
2

Crime in the data is defined as theft, robbery, vandalism or arson on the establishment’s premises. This
notion of crime is likely an under-estimate of crime more broadly defined to include corruption in the form
of extortion/bribery by government officials as this is a prevalent form of crime in most poor and developing
countries. In this paper, we focus on the narrow notion of crime because of limited data availability on
corruption at the establishment level. However, the economic insights of our analysis holds for the broader
notion of crime likely corresponding with larger quantitative implications.

3

We discipline the quantitative analysis using the WBES dataset, which contains information on crime and external finance at the establishment level. The dataset contains detailed
information related to theft, robbery, vandalism, and arson on the establishment’s premises,
which is our notion of crime. For financial market development we use data on whether an
establishment is able to obtain a loan and whether it is financed through internal or external
sources. Key parameters in the model are calibrated to match relevant micro and macro moments on crime and access to finance in Colombia. In particular, we pin down the parameter
that governs the rule of law in Colombia by targeting the proportion of establishments that
report incidences related to crime in a given year, and pin down the level of financial market
development by targeting the share of capital financed through external sources. Each of
these targets are based on an aggregation of establishment-level observations from the micro
data.3
We show that the model can broadly capture the disaggregate patterns of crime, protection, and external finance across establishments in Colombia. In addition, we provide
some evidence that the model generates reasonable quantitative predictions for these variables in institutional settings that differ from that in Colombia, spanning a portion of the
variation in institutional development across countries. For example, the higher rule of law
in China and India in the model compared to Colombia implies that the share of crime and
protection is much more uniform across establishments than in Colombia, a pattern that is
broadly consistent with the micro data for these countries. The model with lower levels of
institutional development than Colombia, such as in Guatemala and Mozambique, implies
that the across establishment profile of crime and protection is steeper, consistent with the
implications of the micro data for these countries. The evidence suggests that our quantitative framework provides a reasonable setting to evaluate the aggregate implications of
institutional development and the relative merits of institutional reform.
3
We choose Colombia for the calibration because crime and access finance are equally important obstacles
to business operation in this country.

4

Our main findings are as follows. The long-run effects of crime and access to finance
are quantitatively important. The difference in institutional development between Colombia
and the undistorted economy lowers aggregate output by close to 30 percent in Colombia,
lowers TFP by close to 20 percent, and lowers consumption by over 30 percent. In an
economy with the weakest level of institutional development, as implied by the data in our
sample of countries, aggregate output and consumption is about 50 percent lower than in the
undistorted economy. Since institutional development is uniquely identified through separate
parameters in the model, we can assess the relative importance of crime and financial frictions
in generating these effects. Crime lowers aggregate output by 3 percent in Colombia relative
to the undistorted economy—a substantial effect considering that the aggregate losses from
crime is only 0.2 percent of output in Colombia—and financial frictions lower output by 20
percent. Their joint effect exceed the sum of their individual effects implying a substantial
amplification on output. Crime and finance account for about 10 and 70 percent of the total
output losses while the remaining 20 percent is from their joint interaction. Moreover, we find
that including crime into a standard model of financial frictions is quantitatively important;
for instance, including crime generates a doubling of the output losses in the economy with
the weakest level of institutional development.
The intuition for the amplification effect is straightforward. In models that feature financial frictions, constrained entrepreneurs can overcome their financing constraint by reinvesting
profits in their business and gradually expanding, the motive to self-finance (Buera and Shin,
2011; Midrigan and Xu, 2014; Moll, 2014). Crime hinders this process. As entrepreneurs
invest and expand, they become a bigger target for crime. Constrained entrepreneurs face
a trade-off: gradual expansion is a necessary condition to alleviate financing constraints but
doing so exposes them to crime. Resources are lost due to crime and/or spent on protection
which slows re-investment and the process of overcoming the financing constraint. Financial
frictions, in turn, increase the potential for crime. This is because financing constraints lower
entrepreneur profit which reduces how much is spent on protection, thus raising the poten-

5

tial for crime. Taken together, financial frictions increase the likelihood of crime, and crime
impedes the motive to self-finance, both of which amplify output losses.
Our results broadly contribute to the long-standing questions in the macro-development
literature related to institutions and their relevance for development. One strand in the literature stresses the importance of a strong rule of law for development through its effects on
entrepreneurial investment and expansion (Besley, 1995; Shleifer, 1997; Shleifer and Vishny,
1998; Svensson, 1998; Acemoglu et al., 2001) while a separate strand emphasizes that financial market development is critical for the efficient allocation of capital (King and Levine,
1993; Levine, 1997; Rajan and Zingales, 1998; Levine et al., 2000). Our framework, which
incorporates these measures of institutional development is able to assess the importance of
each of these factors. Specifically, we use our framework to ask whether improving financial
market development (i.e. access to finance) or the rule of law (i.e. lowering crime) has a
bigger effect on economic development (as measured by aggregate output), and if the impact
of the policy depends on the level of institutional development. We find that when the rule
of law is weak improving it is more important for development, irrespective of the level of
financial market development. However, when the rule of law is above a certain threshold,
improving financial markets become more important for development.4 Hence, while financial markets are crucial for development, a necessary condition is that property rights are
secure (McMillan, 1997; Johnson et al., 2002). Moreover, we use our framework to inform
which countries are associated with a weak rule of law and financial markets by mapping
relevant moments in the model to the data on crime and access to finance. Based on our
simulations, improving the rule of law is more important for development for about 20 percent of our sample of countries, notably Guatemala, South Africa and Costa Rica, while for
the majority of countries improving financial markets is more important.
Our paper relates to the broad misallocation literature but more closely to the misalloca4

tion literature emphasizing either financial frictions or crime. The macro literature emphasizing financial frictions include Jeong and Townsend (2007), Amaral and Quintin (2010),
Buera et al. (2011), Buera and Shin (2013), Caselli and Gennaioli (2013), Greenwood et al.
(2013), Midrigan and Xu (2014), Moll (2014), among many others. Fewer studies examine
the macro effects of crime, an exception being Ranasinghe (2017) who studies the effects
of extortion in Eastern Europe. Our framework integrates these two relevant institutions
studying their interaction and potential to account for the substantial differences in output
per capita across countries.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides micro-level evidence
relating to the prevalence of crime and access to finance across countries. In Section 3 we
present the model which combines the effects of crime and financial frictions. Section 4
describes the calibration of the model and the cross-country calibration of the rule of law
and financial friction institutions. In Section 5, we report our quantitive results. Section 6
concludes.

Facts

We use data from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys (WBES) 2006-17 to document the
prevalence of crime and lack of access to finance among establishments across countries at
different levels of development. We use the most recent survey for each country within this
timeframe. The survey contains establishment-level information for a sample of 138 countries,
mostly developing and poor countries. See Table A.1 in Appendix A.1 for a comprehensive
list of countries in this sample.
While the importance of access to finance is well documented in the literature, less known
are the key patterns related to crime across countries. The micro data contains information
related to obstacles to doing business at the establishment level. There are several questions

7

in the survey devoted to understanding crime. In particular, establishments report whether
they experienced theft, robbery, vandalism or arson on their premises in the past year—which
we interpret as crime against the establishment—and the value of losses from crime as a share
of sales. Establishments also report whether crime is a severe, major, moderate, minor or
non-obstacle to business operation.5 The WBES also contains information on whether an
establishment paid for private security and the amount paid for these services as a share of
sales. Also included in the survey are questions related to financing, specifically the proportion of establishment capital and investment financed through external sources. Relevant to
our analysis is an establishment’s potential to access finance from financial intermediaries.
We use the proportion of working capital financed through banks as a proxy for financial
market development and access to finance. Establishments also report whether access to
finance is a severe, major, moderate, minor or non-obstacle to business operation.6
Table 1 reports the percentage of establishments that state a given distortion is a severe
or major obstacle to business operation across sub-continents in the world. While our focus
is on crime and access to finance, for comparison we also report two distortions that are
generally viewed as important obstacles for business operation in poor countries: practices
of the informal sector and tax administration. There are two main points that Table 1
highlights. First, access to finance is a major constraint to business operation in many parts
of the world, notably in Sub-Saharan Africa where over 40 percent of establishments report
finance as a major obstacle. Second, crime is also a major obstacle to business operation,
and an equally pressing issue in several sub-continents as the other distortions listed in the
table. For instance, in Central and South America about 30 and 35 percent of establishments
report crime as a major obstacle to business operation.

Corruption is often listed as the biggest obstacle to business operation in poor countries, and like crime,
is closely connected to a country’s rule of law.

See Hallward-Driemeier and Pritchett (2015) for a broader discussion of the relevance of establishmentlevel data to measure costs associated with doing business in a country. Compared to legal institutional
measures in the World Bank’s Doing Business, measures from establishment-level data paint a more accurate
picture of actual costs of operating in a country.

Notes: The table documents the percentage of establishments that report a given obstacle (access
to finance, crime, informal sector, tax administration) is a severe or major obstacle to business
operation by sub-continents. Possible responses include severe, major, moderate, minor or nonobstacle to operation. Sub-continent averages are based on country-level statistics from the most
recent survey for each country from the WBES 2006-17. The country-level data includes 138
countries, see Appendix A.1 for a list of countries and more details.

Next, we examine how measures related to access to finance and crime vary across countries. These measures are shown in Figure 1. Panel A documents average losses from crime as
a percentage of sales, contingent on establishments facing crime, plotted against log GDP per
capita (PPP prices, 2014). There is a negative correlation between these variables (−0.42)
implying that countries with higher GDP per capita have fewer losses from crime. Average
losses from crime as a share of sales among establishments that face crime exceed 10 percent
in several countries, notably those in Africa. While we have focused on average losses from
crime, other measures related to crime share a similar pattern with GDP per capita. In particular, countries that have high average losses from crime report crime as a major obstacle
to operation and have a high frequency of crime. For instance, in Chad, Chile, South Africa
and Venezuela over 35 percent of establishments report at least one incident related to crime
in a given year. Figure 1 Panel B documents the proportion of investment financed by banks,
which is a proxy for access to finance, plotted against log GDP per capita (PPP prices, 2014)
across countries. There is a positive correlation between these variables (0.40) implying that
countries with higher GDP per capita feature a larger share of investment financed through
financial institutions. This pattern holds for other measures related to access to finance as

investment financed through external sources (banks and non-bank financial institutions),
among others.

Notes: Country-level statistics for crime and access to finance are from the WBES 2006-17, most recent year
for each country. GDP per capita, PPP adjusted 2014, is from the World Bank. The sample is based on
138 countries described in Appendix A.1, where two countries do not report the statistic on crime. Crime
refers to losses from theft, robbery, vandalism or arson in the establishment’s premises in a given year as a
proportion of sales, among the sub-sample of establishments that face crime. Access to finance refers to the
proportion of investment financed through banks. Both variables are weighted averages across establishments
in each country.

To further assess the effects of crime and access to finance across countries, Figure 2 plots
the relationship between the percentage of establishments that report crime is a major or
severe obstacle to business operation and the percentage of establishments that report access
to finance is a major or severe obstacle. The correlation between these measures of crime
and access to finance is 0.49 implying that in countries where access to finance is particularly acute, so is crime. Notably, for several countries in Africa a substantial proportion of
establishments report that both access to finance and crime are major obstacles to business
operation. Given the importance and correlation of these variables, evaluating the joint interaction of these institutions may provide key insights in accounting for differences in income
per capita across countries.

Access to finance severe/major obstacle (% of establishments)

Notes: Country-level statistics for crime and access to finance is from the WBES 2006-17, most recent year
in each country. Crime and access to finance refer to the proportion of establishments that report each as
severe or major obstacles to doing business. The sample includes 138 countries as described in Appendix A.1
with one country not reporting the statistic on crime.

So far, we have documented that lack of access to finance and crime are particularly
severe in poor countries. A key feature in models of production heterogeneity is whether
institutions such as financial development and the rule of law at the country level translate
into effects that are idiosyncratic across establishments (i.e. affect establishments differently).
We now evaluate how access to finance and crime vary across the size distribution of establishments. Our general finding is that the effects from lack of finance dissipate as the size of
the establishment increases, whereas the effects of crime are non-monotone on establishment
size, being largest for middle size establishments. To highlight these points, we regress measures related to access to finance and crime on establishment size controlling for industry,
city, country, continent-level and time fixed effects. These regressions are meant to provide
a general pattern and do not have a causal interpretation. To get at the cross-establishment
patterns, we use establishment-level data from the WBES 2006-17 and restrict the sample

11

to countries that have 500 or more establishments surveyed.7 We consider four dependent
variables: (1) whether access to finance is an obstacle to doing business (0 − 4 scale), (2)
proportion of working capital financed by banks (0−4 scale), (3) whether crime is an obstacle
to doing business (0 − 4 scale), and (4) whether an establishment has faced crime in the past
year (yes/no).8 The independent variable is establishment size, a categorical variable based
on the number of employees.
We report the results in Table 2 for all establishments, for small establishments (n ≤ 20),
and for non-small establishments (n > 20). There are two main points we highlight. First,
lack of access to finance is negatively related with establishment size. This conclusion arises
from the negative coefficient in column (1), for all, small, and non-small establishments,
implying that as establishment size rises access to finance is less of an obstacle to business
operation—for instance, a categorical increase in the size variable lowers the likelihood of
reporting finance as a major or severe obstacle by over 12 percent for non-small establishments.9 Also, the positive coefficient in column (2) means that the proportion of working
capital financed by banks rises with size, implying that larger establishments are better able
to access credit, at least relative to smaller establishments.10 The estimates in columns (1)
and (2) clearly point to the effects from lack of access to finance falling with size. This
7

A well-known issue with the WBES dataset is the limited number of observations in many countries,
which can render noisy statistics, especially for indicators that are not populated by many establishments
or when disaggregating by establishment characteristics such as size. In this context, we restrict the sample
to countries that have 500 or more establishments surveyed, which results in a sample of 40 countries. See
Appendix A.2 and Table A.2 for a documentation of countries in the sample, survey year and number of
observations (establishments) of each crime and finance variable for each country. We note that the resulting
patterns hold when including countries that have fewer than 500 establishments surveyed (e.g. a threshold
of 250 establishments).
8
Crime obstacle is our preferred measure for the severity of crime because it captures the broader indirect
consequences of crime among the entire sample of establishments, including non-victims of crime whose
behaviour may yet be adversely affected by its presence. For the same reason we also favour the finance
obstacle variable as an indicator of the severity of access to finance.
9
The standard coefficients from the ordered Logit are reported in Table 2 because their signs point to the
direction of the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Raising the coefficients to
the exponential function (i.e. eβi ) provide the odds-ratio.
10
It is worth noting that the percentage of working capital financed by banks is highly correlated with
the percentage of fixed capital purchased in the current year that is financed by banks (with a correlation
coefficient of 0.52). We focus on the working capital variable because there are more than twice as many
observations than for the fixed capital variable. Nevertheless, the estimates reported in Table 2 are similar
under either variable.

Notes: The table reports point estimates of an ordered Logit regression for all establishments, small establishments (≤ 20
employees) and non-small establishments (> 20 employees), based on the WBES definition for small establishments. Size is
an independent categorical variable based on full-time employees: ≤ 5, 6 − 9, 10 − 14, 15 − 20, 21 − 30, 31 − 40, 41 − 50,
51 − 100, 101 − 250 and 251 − 5000. The dependent variables in columns (1) and (3) are whether access to finance and crime
are not an obstacle, a minor, moderate, major or severe obstacle to business operation (0 − 4 scale). The dependent variable
in column (2) is the percentage of working capital borrowed from banks (0 − 4 scale), and in column (4) is whether an
establishment faced crime in the last year (yes/no). Categories for percentage of working capital borrowed from banks are
0%, 1 − 25%, 26 − 50%, 51 − 75% and > 75%. All estimates include industry, city, country, and continent-level fixed effects,
as well as time fixed effects to account for differences in survey year. Industry-level controls are manufacturing, services and
core industries, and city-level controls are related to population size. Standard errors are clustered at the country-level. ∗∗∗ ,
∗∗ and ∗ denote significance at the 1, 5 and 10 percent level.

does not imply, however, that capital is efficiently allocated across establishments since the
link between establishment size and productivity is tenuous in poor countries (Restuccia and
Rogerson, 2008; Bartelsman et al., 2013).
Second, the effects of crime are non-uniform across establishment size. The regression
estimate in column (3) is positive for all establishments, positive, larger in magnitude and
strongly significant for small establishments, and negative for non-small establishments, implying that the severity of crime initially rises with establishment size and falls thereafter.11
11

In Appendix A.2, we show our estimates across small and non-small establishments in Table 2 are

13

We also find that losses from crime as a percentage of establishment sales falls with size which
may account for the non-monotone effect across size in column (3). The coefficients for all,
small, and non-small establishments in column (4) are positive implying the likelihood of
facing crime rises with size.

Model

Our aim is to evaluate the joint effects of crime and financial frictions on establishment
behaviour and to understand their implications for economic development. To this end,
we consider an otherwise standard span-of-control framework of establishment size as in
Lucas (1978) extended to allow for institutional differences in financial market development
and the rule of law. In the model, individuals differ in entrepreneurial productivity and
asset holdings and choose between operating an establishment as an entrepreneur or being
a worker. We follow a large literature by considering financial market development as a
collateral constraint, which restricts that entrepreneur borrowing is proportional to wealth.
The rule of law influences the potential for crime which affects the returns to entrepreneurship.
Hence, in our framework production and occupation choices are affected by access to finance
and the potential for crime.

3.1

Environment

The economy is populated by a measure one of infinitely-lived individuals who differ in entrepreneurial productivity s ∈ S and asset holdings a ∈ A ≡ [0, ∞). Productivity evolves
over time according to an exogenous Markov process M (s, s0 ). The cumulative distribution
over assets and productivity is denoted by G(a, s). There is no market for consumption insurance which implies that individual asset holdings are the only mechanism for self-insurance
consistent with alternative definitions of small establishments (see Table A.3) and also to using number of
employees rather than the categorical size variable as the independent variable (see Table A.4).

against productivity shocks. Preferences are over streams of consumption,

P∞

t=0

β t u(ct ), are

time separable and β ∈ (0, 1) represents the time discount factor.
Individuals are endowed with one unit of productive time each period, which is supplied
inelastically, and choose between operating an individual specific production technology (entrepreneurship) or working for a wage (worker). Each occupation requires one unit of labor
so that individuals select into one occupation every period. The production technology is
standard, f (s, k, n), which combines the inputs of capital k, labor from workers n, and entrepreneur productivity s to produce output. We assume f (s, k, n) is increasing in all inputs
and features decreasing returns to scale in k and n.
The economy features two distinct distortions. The first is related to financial frictions
arising from underdeveloped financial markets which restricts how much capital entrepreneurs
can borrow. The second is related to crime on entrepreneur capital arising from imperfections
in the rule of law. We describe these in turn.

3.2

Financial frictions

We follow Buera et al. (2011), Midrigan and Xu (2014), and Moll (2014) among others in
modelling financial market development. In particular, financial market imperfections—due
to limited enforcement or monitoring technology—imply that entrepreneurs face a collateral
constraint for borrowing capital given by (1−φ)k ≤ a, where φ ∈ [0, 1] represents the fraction
of capital that can be recouped by financial intermediaries if an entrepreneur defaults. In
this setup, φ serves as a measure of financial market development with higher values of φ
representing more developed financial markets (a higher fraction of capital can be recouped).
This formulation has the intuitive appeal that the amount of capital borrowed depends on
entrepreneur assets a, and is proportional to financial market development φ.12 When φ = 1
1
The collateral constraint can be re-written as k ≤ λ̃a, where λ̃ ≡ 1−φ
, as is more standard. We use φ for
consistency with our modelling of the rule of law and for easier comparison across measures of institutional
development.
12

15

financial markets are fully developed and the collateral constraint is non-binding. Conversely,
when φ = 0 financial markets are non-existent, there is no potential to borrow and capital is
restricted to equal entrepreneur asset holdings. Thus, values of φ ∈ [0, 1] capture differences
in the potential to borrow across economies, and holding φ constant, a captures differences
in the potential to borrow within economies.
We note that the collateral constraint is the only friction in the financial market. In particular, we abstract from issues related to irreversibility and adjustment costs on entrepreneur
capital. Also, the collateral constraint we examine is static and on a per-period basis. While
in reality financial contracts are dynamic, a static one-period contract is sufficient to capture the key features in our analysis—entrepreneur borrowing depends on individual asset
holdings and the level of financial market development in a country.

3.3

Rule of law

The second source of friction arises from the potential for crime against entrepreneurs, which
we model following Ranasinghe (2017). The probability of facing crime depends on two
factors: the rule of law and spending on protection. We think of the rule of law as the
probability with which the state can prevent criminal activity λ ∈ [0, 1], with higher values
of λ representing a stronger rule of law and a lower potential that entrepreneurs face crime.
Entrepreneurs can also reduce the potential of facing crime by buying private protection
p ≥ 0, which supplements the existing rule of law. The cost of private protection p is

bpψ
,
ψ

where b > 0 is a scale parameter and ψ is an elasticity parameter. Taken together, the
probability an entrepreneur faces crime is 1 − F (λ, p), where F (λ, p) = λ(1 + pθ ) ∈ [0, 1],
θ > 0, is increasing in both arguments.13 In this setup, λ has a similar interpretation for
institutional development as φ. When λ = 1 there is no opportunity for crime and when λ = 0
 θ1
It follows that p ∈ [0, p̄] where p̄ = 1−λ
, which ensures that F (λ, p) ≤ 1. We also assume protection
λ
is bought post-production and does not require financing. This allows us to isolate the effects of financial
frictions on capital demand and avoid unnecessary complexity.
13

16

the rule of law is non-existent and criminal activity occurs un-impeded. Values of λ ∈ [0, 1]
therefore capture institutional differences in the potential for crime across countries, and
holding λ constant, p captures differences in the potential for crime across establishments
within countries due to differences in private protection spending.
We now discuss the motivation for our modelling and functional form choices for crime.
The functional form for F (λ, p) allows for an economy-wide component—the rule of law
λ—and an idiosyncratic component—private protection p—which capture differences in the
severity of facing crime across establishments within a country as well as differences across
countries, the strength of which depends on two parameters λ and θ. Note that the assumed
functional form has other implications to capture features of reality. First, the likelihood of
facing crime decreases with the rule of law and private protection. Second, the rule of law
and protection are complementary. Protection spending is more effective in lowering crime
when the rule of law is strong. In particular, λ is the minimum level of protection common
to all entrepreneurs (F (λ, 0) = λ) and protection is ineffective in lowering crime when there
is no rule of law (F (0, p) = 0). In the quantitative analysis that follows, the parameters
λ and θ will be disciplined with data on the prevalence of crime in an economy as well as
crime differences across establishments. In addition, data on losses from crime and protection
spending will inform and put discipline on the values for the parameters on the cost of private
protection.
We model crime as the fraction of entrepreneur capital expropriated by an exogenous
stand-in Crime Group.14 In particular, if an entrepreneur does not face crime, which occurs
with probability F (λ, p), profit from production is

π(a, s, k, n) = f (s, k, n) − wn − (1 + r)k + (1 − δ)k,
14

We could instead assume that crime is related to output with little consequence to our main results. Since
access to finance is related to capital, for consistency, we also model crime as dependant on entrepreneur
capital.

17

and if they face crime, which occurs with probability 1 − F (λ, p), profit from production is

πc (a, s, k, n) = f (s, k, n) − wn − (1 + r)k + (1 − δ − e)k,

where w is the wage paid to workers, r is the real interest rate, δ ∈ (0, 1) is the depreciation
rate (hence, r + δ is the rental rate of capital), and e ∈ (0, 1) is the fraction of capital lost due
to crime. We use e for notational simplicity but note that it is an endogenous outcome which
in equilibrium depends on assets and productivity (i.e. e(a, s)). In each of these scenarios,
entrepreneur choice of capital is constrained by the collateral constraint, (1 − φ)k ≤ a.15
The timing is as follows. Entrepreneurs first make decisions related to production. Then
the Crime Group chooses the fraction of capital to expropriate taking into consideration
entrepreneur capital and protection. In what follows, entrepreneur decisions on capital,
labor and protection are made in anticipation of the Crime Group’s best-response to these
choices.
Note that we focus on crime faced by entrepreneurs, abstracting from crime on individual asset holdings. This is because we focus on the distortionary effects of the rule of
law institution on establishment decisions and hence the data we use on crime is at the
establishment-level. Furthermore, individuals in the model that have the most assets tend
to be entrepreneurs, and hence, asset accumulation and capital are closely linked.
15

The presence of crime can affect financial intermediary lending to entrepreneurs. We abstract from this
effect because it only plays a quantitatively minor role in our framework. Including this channel implies that
the collateral constraint becomes (1 − φ)(1 − ê)k ≤ a, where (1 − ê)k is end of period capital that can be
recouped and ê ≡ (1 − F (λ, p))e is average expected losses from crime, where the over-line represents the
economy-wide average. We assume that financial intermediaries cannot observe entrepreneur productivity
and therefore how much crime they will face. In the WBES data for Colombia, which we use to calibrate our
model for crime, ê is less than one percent and hence this feature would have a limited effect on the collateral
constraint.

18

3.4

Decisions

Entrepreneur decisions are the purchase of protection—which reduces the potential of crime—
and capital and labor inputs in production. Since entrepreneurs face crime with probability
F (λ, p), capital, labor, and protection are chosen to maximize expected profit. Specifically,
the problem of an entrepreneur is

subject to the collateral constraint (1 − φ)k ≤ a. Equation (1) states that with probability
F (·), an entrepreneur does not experience crime and earns profit π(a, s, k, n), and with probability 1 − F (·) faces crime and earns profit πc (a, s, k, n). This expression simplifies to imply
that an entrepreneur earns full profit from production less the fraction of capital lost due to
crime, ek, which occurs with probability 1 − F (·). Expected profit from entrepreneurship for
an individual of type (a, s) is π
e(a, s).
The Crime Group optimizes by choosing how much capital to expropriate from each
entrepreneur of type (a, s), which determines the fraction of capital lost due to crime, e ∈

where the expectation operator is over next period productivity s0 governed by the Markov
process M (s, s0 ). Individuals make a consumption-savings inter-temporal choice and an occupational choice based on max{w, π
e(a, s)}. Since there is no capital irreversibility or adjustment costs, the occupational choice is static which we denote by o(a, s) ∈ {E, W } for an
entrepreneur or worker.

3.5

Stationary competitive equilibrium

A stationary competitive equilibrium consists of an invariant distribution over assets and
productivity G(a, s), policy functions for individuals {c(a, s), a0 (a, s), o(a, s)}, policy functions
for entrepreneurs {k(a, s), n(a, s), p(a, s)}, profits π
e(a, s), policy function for the Crime Group
e(a, s), and prices {w, r}, such that:
(i) Given prices, k(a, s), n(a, s) and p(a, s) solve the entrepreneurs problem in (1), determining π
e(a, s).
(ii) Policy function e(a, s) solves the Crime Group’s problem in (2).
(iii) Given prices and profits, c(a, s), a0 (a, s) and o(a, s) solves the individual’s problem
described in (3).
equilibrium, spending on protection is increasing with establishment capital, consistent with micro-level
evidence. For crime, it is likely that expropriating from high capital establishments is more costly for the
Crime Group. This feature is captured in our framework since protection expenditure rises with establishment
capital, making it more costly to expropriate from high capital establishments due to a lower probability of
success F (·).

Discussion

Prior to evaluating the quantitative implications of crime and financial frictions we discuss
some important insights from the model. In the undistorted economy, when φ = λ =
1, allocations achieve the first-best and productivity is the sole criterion for selection into
entrepreneurship and the scale of production. With lower values for φ and λ, the collateral
constraint tightens and the potential for crime increases, distorting selection and production
decisions. When φ < 1 establishment size depends on both productivity and asset holdings
implying that low asset entrepreneurs operate below the optimal capacity, k(a, s) ≤ k(s).
Likewise, when λ < 1 capital is chosen to maximize expected profit, instead of first-best
profit, which distorts the optimal choice of capital—entrepreneurs who are most vulnerable
to crime choose capital below the optimal scale. Taken together, access to finance restricts
how much capital can be borrowed and crime affects how much capital an entrepreneur wants
to borrow. These distortions affect expected profit from production and have the potential
21

to alter occupational choices.
In our framework each distortion can be analyzed jointly or in isolation, which enables
us to understand how these distortions interact and amplify aggregate output losses. While
we evaluate the effects of these institutions numerically, it is convenient to consider special
cases of the model to highlight the underlying mechanisms at work. Consider the case
when crime is the only distortion in the economy (φ = 1 and λ < 1). When ρ = ψ = 2
and θ = 1, a closed-form solution for crime and protection exists and depends solely on
entrepreneur productivity. This is depicted in Figure 3 for selected values of λ. Note that
as λ increases (stronger rule of law), the incidence of crime and losses from crime decreases
overall, and the pattern across entrepreneurs become flatter, illustrating how the extent
of rule of law in a country can generate idiosyncratic effects across establishments with
different productivity. We show in Section 4.4 that this broad pattern of differences in
crime and protection across entrepreneurs in economies with different levels of institutional
development is consistent with micro evidence for individual countries at the corresponding
levels of institutional development.
In the particular numerical example in Figure 3, protection expenditure is increasing
in productivity and losses from crime—the expropriation of capital—is hump-shaped in entrepreneur productivity, especially so for low values of λ. This pattern arises in this case
because high productivity entrepreneurs purchase sufficient protection to induce lower losses
from crime, whereas low productivity entrepreneurs are not a lucrative target since they use
little capital in production and crime is costly. Moderate productivity entrepreneurs face the
most crime, although the magnitude of this effect depends on λ.

When financial frictions are introduced in the economy (φ < 1 and λ < 1) the potential for
crime rises, especially among high productivity entrepreneurs. To appreciate this point, note
that high productivity entrepreneurs mitigate the effects of crime by spending on protection.
However, when they face financial frictions they choose capital based on their collateral

constraint, which lowers profit and thus spending on protection, raising the potential for
crime. As such, a higher proportion of entrepreneurs become more vulnerable to crime when
financial frictions are present.
Crime amplifies the effects from financial frictions as well. To illustrate this, consider
the case when only financial frictions are present (φ < 1, λ = 1). As highlighted in Buera
and Shin (2011), Midrigan and Xu (2014) and Moll (2014), constrained entrepreneurs can
gradually overcome their collateral constraint through self-financing. By re-investing their
profit, entrepreneurs loosen their collateral constraint which enables them to operate on a
larger scale in subsequent periods. When λ < 1, however, the presence of crime can hinder
this process. Since crime initially rises with capital, as capital rises with productivity, an
entrepreneur that has low assets faces increasing crime since they initially start with little capital in production. While re-investment and gradual expansion is necessary to overcome the
collateral constraint, doing so also increases the potential for crime. As these entrepreneurs
23

expand, more resources are either spent on protection or lost to crime which hinders the
process of relaxing the collateral constraint. These effects are especially severe when the rule
of law is weak (higher potential for crime) magnifying the implied output losses from these
institutions.
We emphasize that our modelling of crime is flexible and can accommodate a variety of
profiles for crime across establishments. The resulting profiles depend on the effectiveness of
private protection on crime and the shape of the protection cost function. It also depends
on the selection of establishments that operate in equilibrium. In particular, because the
peak of the hump-shaped profile expands out as λ falls, as illustrated in Figure 3, losses from
crime can be decreasing, increasing, or non-monotone across establishments depending on
the ability threshold for selection into entrepreneurship and on the parameters for crime. In
the next sections, we show that the model can account for losses from crime across establishments in the calibrated economy as well as for other countries that differ only in the level of
institutional development.

Calibration

To study the effects arising from financial frictions and crime, we take the stance that countries are identical in every respect except for the level of institutional development reflected
in φ as a measure of financial market development and λ as a measure of rule of law. While
countries clearly differ along many additional dimensions, our abstraction enables us to use
our framework to evaluate the quantitative effects arising from these specific institutional
differences.
Our calibration strategy is as follows. We calibrate the model in two steps. First, we
consider an undistorted economy with prefect credit markets and no crime and calibrate
this economy to data for the United States. This allows us to assign values to technology

24

and preference parameters that are well established in the literature. Second, holding the
calibrated parameters for preferences and technology constant, we consider an economy with
financial frictions and crime and calibrate this economy to micro data for Colombia.17 This
allows us to calibrate the remaining parameters on crime and access to finance to match
related moments in the data for Colombia.

4.1

Preferences and technologies

We assume per-period utility features constant relative risk aversion u(c) =

c1−ν
1−ν

and the

future is discounted at a rate β ∈ (0, 1). The entrepreneurial production technology is
f (s, k, n) = s(k α n1−α )1−v , where 1 − v determines returns to scale at the establishment level
and in a competitive economy also determines the share of income accruing to production
inputs (k, n). Then α represents the share of production inputs’ income accruing to capital
and 1 − α to labor. Capital depreciates at the rate δ every period. We assume shocks to the
log of entrepreneurial productivity follow an AR(1) process with persistence ρ and innovation
variance σ 2 . As a result, there are 7 parameters to calibrate at this stage {ν, δ, α, v, ρ, σ, β}.
We consider an economy with φ = λ = 1 and calibrate this economy to U.S. data, which
allows us to pin down these seven parameters without having to take a stance on parameters
related to crime. When φ = λ = 1 the model reduces to a standard span-of-control framework
where there are no financial frictions and no crime. We take this stance not because we think
the U.S. is a crime-free economy but because data on establishment-level crime is mostly for
developing economies which excludes the United States.18
We set ν = 1.5, α = 1/3, δ = 0.08, ρ = 0.95 and σ = 0.2 which are fairly standard
17

In particular, from the WBES 2006-17, we use the latest year for Colombia which is the 2010 survey. In
the Appendix A.4, we consider alternative calibrations to data for Brazil—where crime is more severe than
in Colombia—and to Peru—where access to finance is more severe than in Colombia. Our main results are
qualitatively similar across these alternative calibrations.
18
The data we use is from the WBES which focuses primarily on developing countries and a few developed
countries in Europe. For the most developed countries in Europe, establishment level crime is very small as
is the extent to which establishments face difficulties in obtaining external finance. These facts motivate our
abstraction.

and within the range of values used in the literature. The remaining parameters, v and

entrepreneurs in the working population (entrepreneurship rate), which we target to 7.5
percent (Cagetti and DeNardi, 2006); and (b) the real interest rate which we target to 5
percent. Table 3 reports the model fit for the economy with λ = φ = 1 relative to the U.S.
data and the last column documents the resulting parameter values.

4.2

Institutional development and protection technology

We now turn to the parameters related to institutional development and to establishment
crime and protection. There are two parameters related to institutional development {φ, λ}
and five parameters related to crime and protection {ρ, ψ, h, b, θ}. We calibrate (φ, λ) to the
level of institutional development in Colombia and select crime and protection parameters
to match establishment-level observations related to the severity of crime and protection in
Colombia.19 We choose Colombia for our calibration because crime and access to finance
are equally severe obstacles to business operation. Our data from the WBES discussed in
Section 2 indicates that in Colombia 33 percent of establishments report crime as a major
obstacle to business operation, whereas 41 percent of establishments report access to finance
as a major obstacle.20
19

Throughout, an entrepreneur represents an establishment unit in the data.
For other countries in South America the gap between the proportion of establishments that report crime
and access to finance as major obstacles to operation is more spread, or there are too few observations. See
Appendix A.4 for alternative calibrations of the model to data for Brazil and Peru. Even though crime
and the lack of access to finance is equally or more prevalent in Africa than in South America, we do not
calibrate the model to countries in Africa because there are many missing observations for capital at the
establishment-level in these countries.
20

26

We jointly calibrate the remaining seven parameters by solving the stationary equilibrium
of the model in order to minimize the distance between seven statistics in the model and the
corresponding data moments. While the procedure involves solving all the parameters simultaneously, because each parameter has a first-order effect on some statistic, we discuss them
in turn to motivate the relevance of each data target. We determine φ, the level of financial market development, by targeting the proportion of capital financed through external
sources (bank and non-bank financial intermediaries) which is 35 percent in Colombia (see
Appendix A.3 for details). This target closely mimics the collateral constraint in the model
where higher values of φ imply that a higher proportion of capital is financed through external sources. We determine λ, the rule of law, by targeting the percentage of establishments
that report facing crime in Colombia, which is 24 percent.21 Recall that the probability an
establishment faces crime is 1 − F (λ, p) where λ has a first-order effect on the probability of
crime. Hence, the fraction of establishments that face crime is informative of λ.
Data on crime is used to determine the parameters for the cost function of crime, ρ and h.
The parameter ρ is the elasticity term for engaging in crime with higher values implying that
stealing a larger share of entrepreneur capital is increasingly costly. Hence, ρ is informative of
the share of crime occurring across the establishment size distribution; we target the share of
crime among the top decile of establishments (based on employees), which is 28 percent. The
parameter h is a scale which is useful to target aggregate losses from crime relative to output,
which is 0.2 percent. We pin down parameters for the private protection cost function, ψ and
b, similar to the approach used for the crime cost function. The parameter ψ is the elasticity
term where higher values imply that buying additional protection is increasingly costly and
b is the scale parameter. Therefore, ψ is chosen to target the share of protection spending
among the top decile of establishments, which is 54 percent in the data; and b is chosen to
21
As discussed earlier, our analysis is likely understating the importance of the rule of law since we focus on
a narrow notion of crime by abstracting from corruption. This abstraction is motivated by data limitations
as there is heavy under-reporting and non-response in questions related to corruption and bribe payments.
For example, in Colombia over 50 percent of establishments report corruption is a major obstacle to business
operation but only 3 percent report having to bribe public officials “to get things done”.

Notes: External finance to capital is capital less assets summed across entrepreneurs and divided by
aggregate capital, and prevalence of crime is the percentage of entrepreneurs that face crime. Crime share
is losses from crime in the top employment decile relative to aggregate losses from crime, and crime loss
to output is aggregate losses from crime relative to aggregate output. Protection share and protection
spending to output are defined in like manner. (protection+crime)/output is the sum of protection
spending and losses from crime divided by the sum of output among the top 50 percent of establishments,
by employment decile.

target aggregate spending on protection relative to output, which is 1 percent. Finally, the
parameter θ affects the returns to protection spending and is chosen to target the cost of
protection and crime (total cost associated with crime) relative to output among the top 50
percent of establishments.22
Table 4 reports the target moments from data, the corresponding statistics in the model,
and resulting parameter values associated with a moment. To target the share of capital
financed through external sources the model implies φ = 0.37, which means an entrepreneur
can borrow close to 1.6 times their asset holdings.23 The parameter for the rule of law is
λ = 0.5. In the absence of protection the probability of facing crime is 50 percent (1 − λ),
however, after accounting for protection expenditure, close to 23 percent of entrepreneurs
22
While choosing specific deciles in the distribution of establishments to target ρ, ψ and θ is arbitrary,
we show below that the model with the resulting calibrated parameters does well in matching crime and
protection shares across employment deciles. Our focus on the top decile of the establishment distribution
is motivated by the fact that establishments in this group account for the bulk of production. Similarly,
establishments in the middle of the distribution account for the bulk of protection and crime.
23
Recall that the collateral constraint is k ≤ [1/(1 − φ)]a, where 1/(1 − φ) is the proportion factor of assets
that can be used for borrowing.

actually face crime. It is important to note that this average masks considerable heterogeneity
across establishment’s productivity and wealth: crime rates are hump-shaped in productivity
and decreasing in asset holdings. The elasticities for the cost function for crime and protection
are greater than one, ρ, ψ > 1, implying that stealing a larger share of capital and buying
additional protection is increasingly costly. The scale parameters on the cost functions are
high, especially for crime, to ensure the share of output going to crime and protection is in
line with the evidence.
It is worth noting that the elasticity and scale parameters for the crime and protection
cost functions are non-standard in the literature and there are no direct estimates we can rely
on to gauge whether their values are reasonable. Nevertheless, as we show in Figure 4, panel
(a) and (b), the model does well matching the share of losses from crime and protection
expenditure across employment deciles, despite that we target only the top deciles in our
calibration (and aggregate moments). Furthermore, Figure 4, panel (c), shows that the model
does well matching the share of external finance across employment deciles even though we
target only the aggregate external finance to capital ratio as is common in the literature.
While the model does not match the top decile well, it accounts for the general pattern
that external finance is primarily concentrated among large establishments and negligible
among small establishments. That the model captures closely these features of crime and
external finance across the size distribution of establishments give us confidence in using our
quantitative framework to study the implications of the rule of law for economic development.
Furthermore, in Section 4.4, we show that the disaggregate implications of the model for
economies with different levels of institutional development are consistent with micro evidence
across countries, providing further confidence on the aggregate implications of the model.

Financial development and the rule of law across countries

In our quantitative analysis in the next section, we consider cross-country variations in the
two parameters describing institutional development: financial development φ and the rule
of law λ. What are the plausible ranges for these parameters across countries? In the model,
financial market development maps to the proportion of capital financed through external
sources and the rule of law maps into the prevalence of crime. We therefore, holding all
parameters in the model fixed, re-calibrate φ and λ to replicate these statistics based on the
WBES 2006-17 for countries that have at least 100 observations for both external finance
and crime.24
Figure 5 reports the implied values of φ and λ based on this sample. The proportion of
capital financed through external sources range from 2 to 50 percent and the percentage of
establishments facing crime range from 0 to just over 45 percent. The implied values for φ
and λ given the above ranges are φ ∈ (0.02, 0.55) and λ ∈ (0.35, 0.99). We think the lower
range for λ is conservative. For example, expanding the sample of countries to include all
countries that have over 100 observations for crime (dropping the requirement on observations
for external finance), the proportion of establishments facing crime range from 0 to over 50
percent, where close to 20 percent of the countries in the sample have crime rates in excess
of 30 percent. Accounting for these additional countries implies values of λ as low as 0.3.

4.4

Model outside validation

We have shown that the model calibrated to data for Colombia can broadly capture the
disaggregate patterns of crime, protection, and external finance across establishments. Since
the analysis that follows consists of studying the aggregate implications of variations in the
degrees of crime and financial frictions across countries as reported in the previous section,
24

This renders a sample of 34 countries. See Appendix A.3 and Table A.5 for a list of countries, the number
of observations per country, and the implied values of φ and λ for each country.

Notes: The figure shows the values of φ and λ that generate the external finance to capital ratio and the
percentage of establishments facing crime for a sample of 34 countries in the WBES 2006-17, holding all other
parameters in the model fixed. The sample is restricted to countries that have at least 100 observations on
incidence of crime and external finance. See Appendix A.3 for details of the resulting sample.

we would like to provide some evidence that the model generates reasonable quantitative
predictions for key variables in institutional settings that differ from that in Colombia.
Based on the evidence for φ and λ in Figure 5, we study the implications of the model
in four countries that span a portion of the variation in institutional development across
countries. We study India and China that have a much higher rule of law (higher λ) than
Colombia; and Guatemala and Mozambique with a lower rule of law than Colombia. These
countries also span similar or higher financial frictions (lower φ) than Colombia. In each case,
we modify the values of λ and φ keeping all the other calibrated parameters the same. As
suggested by our discussion in Section 3.6, we expect that the pattern of crime and protection
across establishments becomes flatter for economies with high λ compared to economies with
32

low λ. If so, the key question is whether these patterns are consistent with the micro evidence
for countries with high and low levels of institutional development.
We report the results of these experiments in Figures 6 and 7, along with the corresponding data statistics for each country. These figures are analogous to Figure 4 for Colombia
discussed earlier. The figures show that the patterns implied by the model for differences
in institutional development are broadly consistent with the establishment-level implications
in the corresponding countries. For example, the higher λ in China and India compared to
Colombia implies that the incidence of crime is much lower in these countries, the prevalence
of crime is 3.8 percent of the establishments in China and 3.2 percent in India, whereas it is
23.7 percent in Colombia. Importantly, the higher λ in China and India in the model implies
that the share of crime and protection is much more uniform across establishments than
in the case of Colombia, a pattern that is broadly consistent with the micro data for these
countries, as illustrated in Figure 6. The model with lower levels of institutional development
than Colombia, such as Guatemala and Mozambique, implies that the across establishment
profile of crime and protection is steeper, again consistent with the implications of the micro
data for these countries, as illustrated in Figure 7. In particular, for the level of institutional
development in Guatemala, the model implies that the total cost of crime among the above
median establishment is 3.7 percent of output compared to 3.9 percent in the model, whereas
in the Colombian data this statistic is only 1.2 percent.
We conclude that our quantitative framework provides a reasonable setting to evaluate
the aggregate implications of institutional development in the next section and in particular
to evaluate the relative merits of institutional reform we purse in Section 5.3.

Results

We evaluate the implications of crime and financial frictions by studying economies that are
otherwise identical to our calibrated economy except on the parameters φ and λ representing
differences in the level of institutional development. We study the effects on aggregate outcomes of these institutions jointly and in isolation to assess the importance of each institution
and their amplification effects. We also evaluate the importance for economic development of
policy reforms that improve the rule of law or financial market development across economies
that differ along the level of institutional development.

5.1

Quantitative effects

Table 5 reports relevant statistics such as aggregate output, capital, consumption, and total
factor productivity (TFP) for two economies: an economy with (λ = .5, φ = .37) which was
calibrated to institutional levels and establishment crime and protection data for Colombia,
and an economy with (λ = 0.35, φ = .15), one of the weakest levels of institutional development observed in the cross-country data documented earlier (Guatemala in Figure 5). All
results are reported relative to the undistorted economy (φ = λ = 1) which was calibrated
to U.S. data.
The main result from Table 5 is that institutional differences in the rule of law and
financial market development have substantial negative effects on aggregate variables. In the
Colombia economy, output is 28 percent below the undistorted economy, TFP is 17 percent
lower, and aggregate capital and consumption are 35 and 32 percent lower. These aggregate
effects are magnified in the economy with the weakest level of institutional development where
aggregate output is about half that of the undistorted economy. Hence, for this economy, an
improvement in institutional development alone to levels in the undistorted economy would
increase output by close to a two-fold factor. Consumption is more than 50 percent below

36

the undistorted economy.25 The reduction in these aggregate variables are attributed to
effects along the intensive and extensive margins of production. Along the intensive margin,
entrepreneur capital demand falls both due to the collateral constraint and anticipated losses
from crime. This translates to effects along the extensive margin lowering the number of
entrepreneurs (entrepreneurship rate) and raising average establishment size. Nonetheless,
the average capital to labor ratio used in production—or capital intensity—is lower; relative
to the undistorted economy, capital intensity in production is about five times lower in the
Weakest economy. Importantly, these effects are despite lower equilibrium prices for capital
and labor in the distorted economies.

Next, we isolate the effects attributable to crime and financial frictions. We decompose
the effects of crime and finance in the Colombia economy and the Weakest economy. Table
6 reports the results relative to the undistorted economy. The columns labelled “Crime”
present the scenario where each economy maintains its rule of law and adopts the level
of financial market development in the undistorted economy. In this scenario, differences
between the distorted economies and the undistorted economy are solely attributable to
differences in the rule of law, thereby isolating the quantitative importance of crime. In
the Weakest economy, crime alone reduces output by 24 percent, capital by more than 60

TFP in the Weakest economy is higher than in the Colombia economy due to lower equilibrium prices

percent, and consumption by 30 percent. In the Colombia economy, crime reduces output by
3 percent, capital by 10 percent, and consumption by 5 percent. These effects are substantial
considering that the aggregate losses from crime represent only 0.2 percent of output in
Colombia. Protection plays an important role in accurately accounting for the importance
of crime across establishments by for example ensuring that the share of crime for the top
employment decile of establishments is in line with the evidence.26

Notes: Statistics are reported relative to the undistorted economy, λ = φ = 1. Total reports the effects of
access to finance and crime in each economy. Crime reports the effects if only crime is present (i.e. φ = 1)
and Finance reports the effects if only weak access to finance is present (i.e. λ = 1).

The columns “Finance” isolate the effects arising from financial frictions by considering
the case where each economy maintains its level of financial market development and adopts
the rule of law of the undistorted economy. We find that in the Colombia economy, access to
finance has substantially larger effects on aggregate output, capital and consumption than
crime. Aggregate output falls by 20 percent, capital and consumption by 24 and 20 percent.
In the Weakest economy, the effects of access to finance are similar to those for crime, lowering
output and consumption by about 25 percent. Our results also imply that TFP losses arise
primarily from frictions in access to finance.
It is worth noting that the difference between “Total” and “Finance” represents the ad26

Excluding protection from the model would imply that crime rises with establishment size, producing
substantially larger effects on aggregate variables.

38

ditional quantitative effects of including crime in a standard model of financial frictions with
collateral constraints.27 The quantitative effects of adding crime to the Colombia economy
with financial frictions generates an additional 40 percent reduction in output, 45 percent
lower aggregate capital, and 60 percent lower consumption. These negative effects are much
larger in the Weakest economy where adding crime roughly doubles the negative impact
output, capital, and consumption.

5.2

Amplification

We now turn to the amplification effects that arise from evaluating crime and financial frictions together. As presented in Table 6, the joint effects from these distortions are greater
than the sum of their individual effects. For instance, when examined in isolation crime lowers output by 3 percent and financial frictions lower output by 20 percent in the Colombia
economy; when examined jointly they account for a 28 percent reduction in output—a more
than 20 percent bigger effect on output than the sum of their individual components. Similarly for consumption—examined in isolation crime and financial frictions lower output by 5
and 20 percent respectively, but when evaluated together consumption falls by 32 percent.28
Put differently, about 63 percent of the drop in consumption is accounted for by financial
frictions, about 15 percent by crime and the remaining 22 percent is due to the interaction
of these distortions.
The model provides a simple intuition for the amplification mechanism. As already discussed, in models that feature financial frictions, entrepreneurs can self-finance and overcome
collateral constraints. Crime hinders this process because as constrained entrepreneurs expand they become a bigger target for crime. In equilibrium, the proportion of individuals with
27

Setting λ = 1 and re-calibrating φ to match the proportion of capital financed through external sources
generates a value almost identical to the one in Table 4. Hence, the results reported in column “Finance” in
Table 6 represents the quantitative effects from a model that only features financial frictions.
28
We find similar patterns for alternative calibrated economies to data in Brazil and Peru, see Appendix
A.4.

low wealth rises and the wealth distribution becomes positive skewed amplifying aggregate
losses.
Financial frictions magnify the severity of crime as well. In the model, high productivity
entrepreneurs buy protection to limit their exposure to crime. Financial frictions restrict
establishment size and spending on protection which raises the potential for crime. Figure 8
shows overall protection, 1 − F (λ, p), and the fraction of capital lost due to crime across
entrepreneur productivity in the Colombian economy. The solid line in the left panel shows
overall protection for high asset (or relatively unconstrained) entrepreneurs, and the corresponding line on the right panel shows the fraction of capital expropriated, contingent on
facing crime. High productivity entrepreneurs, who account for the bulk of aggregate output, face minimal losses from crime (the curve is hump-shaped in productivity). In contrast,
low/moderate asset–high productivity entrepreneurs face a higher probability of crime and
lose a larger share of capital (dashed and dotted lines in the figure). For these entrepreneurs,
financial frictions limit their scale of operation, spending on protection and increase the
severity of crime.
Taken together, crime limits entrepreneur self-financing and financial frictions raise the
40

probability of crime. These channels are reinforcing, and account for the amplification effects
on output, capital and consumption.

5.3

Policy reform

A long standing question in economic development surrounds which institutional factors are
most crucial for development. A strand of the literature stresses that a strong rule of law is
critical to incentivize investment and business expansion, thereby spurring development (e.g.,
Besley, 1995; Shleifer and Vishny, 1998; Svensson, 1998). Another strand of the literature
emphasizes that financial markets are essential for the efficient allocation of resources across
establishments and is a key component for economic development (e.g., King and Levine,
1993; Levine, 1997; Rajan and Zingales, 1998). While the underlying mechanisms in both
literatures are important, it remains elusive which institutional factor is most relevant for
development. Our framework allows us to provide some insight into this question by assessing
the relative importance of each institutional factor for development, side-stepping issues
related to identification often encountered in empirical work in this area.29
We ask, do comparable improvements in financial market development (φ) or the rule of
law (λ) have differential effects on aggregate output? If so, how do the differences depend
on the level of institutional development of the country (e.g., the level of φ and λ)? Our
approach is to evaluate the long-run effects on aggregate outcomes of a hypothetical policy
reform that improves either financial markets (φ) or the rule of law (λ). Our analysis focuses
on the long-run benefits associated with a given reform, abstracting from important issues
such as the cost of the reform, the transition to long-run outcomes, the source of reform
or political viability, and the important details of implementation, among others. For this
29

Determining the relative importance of rule of law and financial frictions for development empirically
is challenging since improvements in one source of institutional measure often triggers an improvement in
another institutional measure, preventing identification. An exception is Johnson et al. (2002) who use an
exogenous policy change in post-Communist Europe to evaluate the effects of improved access to finance
across six countries.

41

reason, we refrain from making statements on welfare from these reforms. We assume only
one of these reforms is implemented at a time. Reforms that improve the rule of law can
be interpreted as policies that lower crime and reforms that improve financial markets are
policies that increase access to finance.30
Table 7 reports values for steady-state aggregate output across economies that differ in
the rule of law and financial market development, based on the range of calibrated parameters
from Section 4.3. The numbers reported in the table are relative to aggregate output in the
economy with λ = φ = 0.3. We begin with financial market reform, studying the effects of
improving access to finance from φ = 0.3 across economies that differ in the rule of law λ.
Improving access to finance raises output in each case, with the largest effects in economies
that have a weak rule of law. For example, improving access to finance from φ = 0.3 to
0.9 (roughly equivalent to a policy that raises external finance to capital ratio from 21 to 62
percent) increases aggregate output by 36 percent in the economy with a weak rule of law
λ = 0.3, whereas 28 percent in the economy with λ = 0.9.31 Improving access to finance in
low λ economies not only improves the allocation of resources across entrepreneurs, but also
enables them to negate the potential of crime by spending on protection, amplifying output
gains. We now focus on the reform of the rule of law, evaluating the effects of improving
the rule of law from λ = 0.3 across economies that differ in financial market development
φ. Output increases substantially in each case with the largest gains in economies that have
weak financial markets. For example, a reform that increases λ from 0.3 to 0.9 (roughly
equivalent to a policy that lowers incidence of crime from 55 to 3 percent) generates an
increase in output of 52 percent for the φ = 0.3 economy and 42 percent in the φ = 0.9
economy.
Our results indicate that when the rule of law is relatively weak, i.e. λ < 0.4, improving
30

There are many examples of large-scale economy-wide reforms. Related to access to finance, recent
examples include a major reform in India in 1998 (Banerjee and Duflo, 2014) and in Mexico in 2014. Mexico’s
stance on the drug war in 2010 is an example of a policy reform that aims to improve the rule of law.
31
In the undistorted economy with λ = φ = 1, the crime rate is zero percent and external finance to capital
is 77 percent.

the rule of law is above this threshold, improving financial markets becomes more important
for development. Within the context of the model, in countries where the probability an
establishment faces crime exceeds 33 percent and crime as percentage of output is close to
2 percent, improving the rule of law has larger effects on output than improving access to
finance. To appreciate this point note in Table 7 that the output gains from improvements
in the rule of law mostly occur from 0.3 to 0.5, whereas for financial market development
the gains are spread more evenly over the increase in access to finance. These results imply
that when the rule of law is weak, improving it should take priority over financial market
development; beyond this, improving financial market development becomes more important.
Of course, the costs of improving these institutions could be vastly different and hence these
findings should be interpreted with this in mind.
These results relate to the empirical literature on why access to finance programs can have
muted effects, see for instance Berge et al. (2015) and Karlan et al. (2014). Our framework
emphasizes that in environments where other factors are more pressing concerns, such as
crime, policies that improve access to finance are likely to have smaller effects. In other words,
the rule of law is a precondition to reap the benefits from financial market development. We
note that our results imply that in several countries in the world (for instance, Guatemala,
South Africa, Costa Rica and Chile, where crime rates exceed 35 percent) improving the rule
43

of law (lowering crime) is essential for development, whereas for most countries, improving
financial markets is the most relevant institution for development.

Conclusion

We developed an integrated framework to evaluate the effects of two highly relevant institutions that are prevalent in developing countries: weak access to finance and crime. The
framework is an otherwise standard model of occupational choice and entrepreneurship extended to incorporate financial frictions and the rule of law. A calibrated version of this
framework revealed several key insights. First, weak access to finance and rule of law have
strong negative effects on aggregate outcomes, reducing output by close to two-fold factor
relative to a undistorted economy. Second, we find strong complementarities among the two
institutions we consider, that is we find the amplification effects of crime and access to finance on macro variables to be substantial. In our model output losses are amplified because
weak access to finance lowers the ability of an entrepreneur to buy protection against crime,
thereby raising the possibility for crime. Likewise, crime deters the self-finance motive which
exacerbates the effects on output from financial frictions. Third, we studied the effects of
policy reforms in our framework. When both financial market development and the rule of
law are weak, policies that improve the rule of law have a bigger positive impact on aggregate
output than those that improve financial market development. However, at reasonable levels
of rule of law, polices that liberalize financial markets increase output more than further
improvements in rule of law. An interpretation of our result is that financial markets are
crucial for development, but a necessary condition is that property rights are secure.
Recent empirical studies on micro-finance programs show mixed results and a lack of
consensus whether these programs are an effective tool for promoting development (e.g Karlan
et al., 2014; Berge et al., 2015). Our results highlight that expropriation can influence whether
micro-finance programs have viable long-run effects. In particular, our results indicate that
44

polices that liberalize financial markets have large aggregate output effects in economies
where the rule of law is at least moderate, but much smaller effects when the rule of law
is weak. A relevant extension of our analysis would be to incorporate the rule of law in
macroeconomic studies of micro-finance programs such as the quantitative study in Buera
et al. (2014).
We have focused on the misallocation effects created by weak access to finance and rule
of law. A weak rule of law and the prevalence of crime can help account for why managers
in less developed countries do not utilize the best management practices as emphasized in
Bloom and VanReenen (2010), Bloom et al. (2010), and Bloom et al. (2013). We leave this
potentially useful exploration for future research.

Data sources and countries

The descriptive statistics presented in Table 1 are based on the most recent country-level data
from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys 2006-17 (enterprisesurveys/data). Table A.1
reports country-level statistics on the percentage of establishments that report finance and
crime as severe/major obstacles to business operation. Countries in the sample with year of
survey are grouped by sub-continents. There are 138 countries in our sample.
Statistics reported in Table 1 are simple averages based on the number of countries in a
sub-continent. These statistics differ from the sub-continent averages reported in the WBES
website because we include all countries to calculate averages, whereas the WBES does not
include high-income countries. Also reported are country-level statistics on the proportion
of investment financed by banks and average losses from crime as a share of sales among
establishments that face crime. Figures 1 and 2 are based on the sample of countries reported
in Table A.1 as well. The statistic for crime as an obstacle to doing business is not reported
for Madagascar, and losses from crime as a percentage of sales among establishments that
face crime is not reported for Dominica and Uzbekistan, which accounts for the slight sample
size differences in Figures 1 and 2.

Access to finance and crime by establishment size

Table A.2 documents the sample characteristics for the results reported in Table 2 where we
regress measures of access to finance and crime on establishment size. The table reports the
number of observations for each variable by country and also the proportion of establishments
that are small (less than or equal to 20 employees). The WBES classifies establishment
responses to subjective questions, broadly defined, as truthful, somewhat truthful and not
truthful, and for more objective questions as reliable and unreliable. In generating our
sample, we exclude establishments whose responses are deemed not truthful and unreliable
(about 8 percent of the initial sample), as well as establishments that do not report number
of full-time employees. We then drop countries that survey fewer than 500 establishments,
which leaves a sample of 40 countries from the WBES 2006-17.
Table 2 shows that the adverse effects of limited access to finance falls with establishment
size, the likelihood of facing crime rises with size, and that crime as an obstacle to doing
business is non-monotone across size. Specifically, crime as an obstacle to doing business
rises with size for small establishments (n ≤ 20 employees) and falls among non-small establishments (n > 20 employees), where we use the definition for small establishments from
the WBES. We investigate whether the pattern that crime as an obstacle to doing business
rises with size for small establishments and falls with non-small establishments hold under
alternative definitions of small establishments. We consider two alternate definitions of small
establishments: n ≤ 15 and n ≤ 40. Table A.3 shows the results. The general pattern
highlighted in Table 2 that crime as an obstacle to doing business rises with size for small
establishments, and falls with size for non-small establishments (to an extent), holds for these
alternative definitions of small establishments.
Table A.4 documents that the patterns highlighted in Table 2 also hold when we use the
number of full-time employees as a regressor instead of a categorical variable for establishment

Notes: The table reports point estimates of an ordered Logit regression for alternate definitions of small and non-small
establishments. Establishment size is an independent categorical variable based on full-time employees: ≤ 5, 6 − 9, 10 − 14,
15 − 20, 21 − 30, 31 − 40, 41 − 50, 51 − 100, 101 − 250 and 251 − 5000. Dependent variables in columns (1) and (3) are
whether access to finance and crime are not an obstacle, a minor, moderate, major or severe obstacle to business operation
(0 − 4 scale). The dependent variable in column (2) is the percentage of working capital borrowed from banks (0 − 4 scale),
and in column (4) is whether an establishment faced crime in the last year (yes/no). Categories for percentage of working
capital borrowed from banks are 0%, 1 − 25%, 26 − 50%, 51 − 75% and > 75%. All estimates include industry, city, country,
and continent-level fixed effects, as well as time fixed effects to account for differences in survey year. Industry-level controls
are manufacturing, services and core industries, and city-level controls are related to population size. Standard errors are
clustered at the country-level. ∗∗∗ , ∗∗ and ∗ denote significance at the 1, 5 and 10 percent level.

Data moments

In Section 4.2 we use the most recent year from the WBES 2006-17 for Colombia, which
is the 2010 Survey, to obtain relevant moments in the data to discipline our quantitative
analysis. Here we provide more detail on how these moments are calculated. We exclude
establishments that report negative values for number of full-time employees and sales (valueadded), and set losses from crime and external finance equal to zero for non-responses. We
also exclude establishments whose responses to subjective questions are deemed not truthful
and for objective questions that are deemed unreliable, as reported in the WBES. To ensure
our moments are not sensitive to outliers, particularly for the crime and protection shares

57

we target, we exclude the top one percent of establishments in sales, employees, protection
and crime. We are left with a sample of 803 establishments for Colombia.
Establishments report whether they experienced losses as a result of crime (yes or no,
question i3 in the Surveys). Summing over establishments that report yes relative to all
establishments gives us the percentage of establishments that face crime.32 Also reported
are annual losses from crime as a percentage of sales (i4a) and sales (d2); the product of
these two variables determines monetary losses from crime. Similarly the product of annual
spending on security as a percentage of sales (i2) and sales determines annual protection
expenditure. The aggregate crime to output ratio is the sum of monetary losses from crime
across establishments divided by the sum of value-added sales across establishments. Valueadded sales is calculated as annual sales less intermediate inputs in production (n2b, n2e, n2f ,
n2j and n2i). Following a similar approach, we use establishment spending on security to
obtain aggregate spending on protection relative to output. To target the share of monetary
losses from crime among the top decile of the distribution, we take the sum of losses from
crime in the top decile (by employees) and divide by aggregate losses from crime; similarly
for the share of protection expenditure across the top decile. The sum of losses from crime
and spending on protection, relative to value added sales, among the top 50 percent of
establishments (by employees) is calculated in a similar manner. For value of capital, we use
the replacement cost of machinery/equipment and land/buildings (n7a and n7b). The WBES
also reports the percentage of working capital financed by external sources (commercial banks,
state-owned banks and non-bank financial institutions; k3bc + k3e). We assume that all
establishment capital is financed based on this percentage. Hence, the product of capital
and percentage of capital financed by external sources, summed across all establishments
and divided by aggregate capital is the external finance to capital ratio. Using fixed assets
financed instead of working capital financed by external sources, generates a slightly higher
external finance to capital ratio (0.385). We also note here that our calibrated economy for
Colombia generates an external finance to output ratio that is very close to what is reported
by the World Bank (Beck et al., 2000).
In Section 4.3 we follow the same procedure described above to determine the probability
of facing crime and the external finance to capital ratio across countries. The sample is
restricted to countries that have at least 100 observations for external finance and crime,
and we exclude countries whose implied external finance to capital ratio is below 1 percent
(Congo, Ethiopia and Pakistan), as well as Sweden which is the only high income country
in the sample. After applying this criteria, we are left with 34 countries. We then find the
values of φ and λ that generate external finance to capital ratios and probability of facing
crime in these 34 countries. Table A.5 reports information for this sample of countries.

A.4

Robustness

We calibrate our model to the Brazil and Peru economies to evaluate the sensitivity of our
quantitative results. We choose Brazil because it has a similar external finance to capital
32

Since we clean the data and drop outliers, each observation is weighted equally for consistency. Using
weights generates a slightly higher target value for incidence of crime.

ratio as Colombia but higher probability of crime; Peru has a similar probability of crime
as Colombia but a lower external finance to capital ratio. Target moments for Brazil and
Peru are calculated similarly to those for Colombia. Table A.6 reports target moments from
the data, corresponding moments in the model and parameter values for the Brazil and Peru
economies. The Colombia economy in Section 4.2 is included for comparison. The calibrated
parameters imply a lower value for φ in Peru, relative to Colombia, and a lower value of
λ in Brazil (though the model under-predicts the probability of facing crime and aggregate
crime relative to output in Brazil). Table A.7 reports the quantitative effects from the lack of
finance and crime for the calibrated economies of Brazil and Peru. For Brazil, adding crime
to a model with financial frictions generates an additional 50, 42 and 84 percent reduction
in output, TFP and consumption; in Peru these values are 30, 29 and 50 percent.

Notes: Statistics are reported relative to the undistorted economy. Total reports the
effects of access to finance and crime in each economy. Crime reports the effects if only
crime is present (i.e. φ = 1) and Finance reports effects if only weak access to finance is
present (i.e. λ = 1).
