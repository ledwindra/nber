ABSTRACT
Has there been an increase in positive assortative mating? Does assortative mating contribute to household
income inequality? Data from the United States Census Bureau suggests there has been a rise in assortative
mating. Additionally, assortative mating affects household income inequality. In particular, if matching
in 2005 between husbands and wives had been random, instead of the pattern observed in the data,
then the Gini coefficient would have fallen from the observed 0.43 to 0.34, so that income inequality
would be smaller. Thus, assortative mating is important for income inequality. The high level of married
female labor-force participation in 2005 is important for this result.

Introduction

Has there been an increase in positive assortative mating on the marriage market since 1960?
How does positive assortative mating in the marriage market contribute to income inequality
across households? These two questions are addressed here. To answer them, samples of
hundreds of thousands of households from the United States Census Bureau are analyzed
for the period 1960 to 2005.

2

The Rise in Positive Assortative Mating

Start with the …rst question: Has there been a rise in positive assortative mating in marriage
across U.S. households? To address this question, consider a regression between a wife’s
educational level and her husband’s. In particular, a regression of the following form is run
for the years y = 1960; 1970; 1980; 1990; 2000; 2005:

eduw
my =

+ eduhmy +

X

t

eduhmy

yearty

t2T

+

X

t

yearty + "my , with "my

N (0; ).

t2T

Here eduhmy and eduw
my represent the years of education for the husband and wife in marriage
m for year y. The variable yearty is a time dummy. It is set up so that yearty = 1, if t = y,
and yearty = 0, if t 6= y, where t 2 T

f1970; 1980; 1990; 2000; 2005g. The coe¢ cient

measures the impact of a husband’s education on his wife’s for the baseline year 1960, since
yearty = 0, for all t, when y = 1960. The coe¢ cient

t

gives the additional impact of a

husband’s education on his wife’s relative to the baseline year, 1960. The evolution of

t

over time speaks to changes in the degree of assortative mating. The regression also includes
a …xed e¤ect for each year as measured by the constants

and

t.

The

t ’s

control for the

secular rise in the educational levels for the married population. The lefthand side panel
of Figure 1 plots the upshot of the regression analysis. As can be seen,
implying that the degree of assortative mating has increased.
1

t

rises over time,

The levels of education are collapsed into …ve categories for the rest of the analysis: less
than high school (HS ), high school (HS), some college (C ), college (C), and post college
(C+). Kendall’s

rank correlation is computed between a husband’s and wife’s education

for each year. The changes in Kendall’s

over time are illustrated in Figure 1, righthand

side panel. While the series displays some nonmonotonicity, Kendall’s

is clearly higher in

2005 relative to 1960.
Last, the pattern of assortative mating between a husband’s and wife’s educational levels
can be examined in a contingency table, as the upper panel in Table 1 does. Each cell
in the contingency table has two entries. The …rst entry gives the observed fraction of
married households in the cell, while the second number displays the fraction that would
occur if matching was random. The diagonal of the contingency table describes the matches
that occur when husband and wife have identical educational levels, both for the observed
matches and when they are random. Take sum along the diagonal for each of these two types
of matches, actual and random. Next, compute the ratio of the actual to random matches
and denote it by . This ratio is also plotted in Figure 1, righthand side panel, for the years
1960; 1970;

; 2005. First, as can be seen, there is positive assortative mating. That is, the

ratios are larger than one, implying that the number of matches between husband and wife
with the identical education level is larger than what would occur if matching was random.
Second, they increase over time. Greenwood et al. (2013) present a structural model of this
rise in positive assortative mating.

Assortative Mating and Income Inequality

Turn to the second question: How does marital sorting a¤ect household income inequality?
Interest in this question is not without precedence. For example, Cancian and Reed (1998)
and Schwartz (2010) both conclude that an increase in assortative mating has led to a rise in
income inequality. The current research addresses this question using an accounting-based
methodology, which is quite di¤erent from other studies. Some income statistics for married
households by educational class are presented in the lower panel of Table 1. Again, each cell
has two entries. The …rst number gives the married household’s income relative to mean

2

income in the economy across all households, married and/or single. The second number is
the share of the wife’s labor income in household labor income. In 1960 if a woman with
a less-than-high-school education (HS ) married a similarly educated man their household
income would be 77 percent of mean household income. If that same woman married a
man with a college education (C) then household income would be 124 percent of the mean.
Alternatively, in 2005 if a woman with post-college education (C+) marries a man with a
less-than-high-school education their income would be 92 percent of mean household income.
This rises to 219 percent if her husband also has a post-college education. So, at some level,
sorting matters for household income.

3.1

Constructing Lorenz Curves and Gini Coe¢ cients

Let fij denote the fraction of households in the U.S. that are of type i in income percentile
j and rij represent the income of such a household relative to mean household income.
The percentile index j is expressed in terms of fractions (e.g., 0.10 instead of 10). The
types are classi…ed as follows: There are married and single households. In a married
household each person is indexed by one of the above educational levels. The wife is also
categorized by whether she works or not. There are ten income percentiles (deciles) so j 2
f0:1; 0:2;

; 1:0g. This leads to 550 (i; j)-combinations of households in total for each year.
P
The share of aggregate income that percentile j accounts for, sj , is given by sj = i fij rij .
Pp P
Pp
The cumulative share of income at percentile p is thus lp
j sj =
j
i fij rij . A Lorenz
Pp P
curve plots lp against p = j i fij . The Gini coe¢ cient, g, is twice the area between the

Lorenz curve and the 450 line. If p moves continuously then the Gini coe¢ cient is de…ned by
R1
g = 2 0 jlp pjdp, where 0 g 1. A higher value for g implies a greater degree of income
inequality. The Lorenz curve and Gini coe¢ cient are clearly functions of the fij ’s and the

rij ’s, for all i and j, so write lp = Lorenzp (ffij g; frij g) and g = Gini(ffij g; frij g).
The Lorenz curves for 1960 and 2005 are pictured in the lefthand side panel of Figure 2.
They show a rise in inequality. The Gini coe¢ cient rises from 0.34 to 0.43. The righthand
side panel shows the relative income for each percentile. In 1960 a household at the 10th
percentile earned 16 percent of mean income. This dropped to 8 percent in 2005. A household
in the 90th percentile earned 251 percent of mean income in 1960 versus 317 percent in 2005.
3

Incomes are more polarized in 2005. The change in wages across individuals is the primary
driver of this increase in income inequality.

3.2

Assortative versus Random Matching

Suppose that matching was random instead of assortative. What would have happened to
the income distributions in 1960 and 2005? To do this experiment the observed pattern of
matching for married couples shown in the contingency table is replaced by the pattern that
would occur if matching was random. Let M represent that set of indices for married couples
and S be the set for singles. The experiment involves replacing the observed ffij g’s for (i; j) 2
M with the set that would obtain if matching was random, denoted by ffeij g for (i; j) 2 M.

The counterfactual Lorenz curve and Gini coe¢ cient are given by Lorenzp (ffij0 g; frij g) and
Gini(ff 0 g; frij g), where ff 0 g ffeij gM [ ffij gS .
ij

ij

The results of the counterfactual experiment are interesting. Moving from the observed

pattern of assortative matching in 1960 to a random pattern has little discernible impact on
income inequality. The Gini coe¢ cient drops only slightly to 0.33. Repeating the experiment
for 2005 has a marked impact on the income distribution, that is shown in the lefthand side
panel of Figure 3. As can be seen, the Lorenz curve shifts in and the Gini drops from 0.43
to 0.34. (The analogous diagram for 1960 is not shown since the shift in the Lorenz curve is
not noticeable.) Why does this experiment a¤ect the Lorenz curve for 2005 but not 1960?
This question will be addressed now.

3.3

Matching and Married Female Labor-Force Participation

For positive assortative matching to have an impact on income inequality married females
must work. Married females worked more in 2005 than 1960. The righthand side panel
of Figure 4 shows married female labor-force participation by percentile. As can be seen,
across all income percentiles labor-force participation was higher in 2005 versus 1960, but the
increase is most precipitous at the highest percentiles. For example, at the 80th percentile
42 percent of married women worked in 1960. This rose to 77 percent in 2005. At the 20th
percentile the numbers are 25 and 34 percent. The lefthand side panel of Figure 4 shows the

4

contribution of the wife’s labor income to household labor income, again by percentile. The
wife’s contribution to household labor income is signi…cantly larger in 2005 relative to 1960.
This share rises with the income percentile. At the 80th percentile the share that married
woman provided to household income rose from 16 to 34 percent, and from 13 to 25 percent
at the 20th percentile.
To examine the impact of married female labor-force participation (MFLP) and sorting
on income inequality, undertake this thought experiment. Assume that matching is random
in the years 1960 and 2005 with one twist: assume that in 1960 married woman participate
in the labor force at their 2005 levels and that in 2005 they work at their 1960 levels. The
resulting Gini coe¢ cients are 0.32 and 0.45. When matching is random, married female
labor-force participation has a signi…cant dampening e¤ect on income inequality for the
year 2005. Random sorting works to equalize incomes across households in 2005 because
it diversi…es income across husbands and wives. But, this e¤ect is only operational to the
extent that married women work. (That is, for 2005 compare 0.34 with 0.45.) Random
matching has less of an e¤ect in 1960 than in 2005. Incomes are less polarized in 1960, as
Figure 1 and Table 1 both show.
Another interesting question to ask is what would have happened to income inequality
if couples in 2005 matched as in 1960. That is, replace the 2005 contingency table with the
1960 one. This experiment is somewhat tricky to operationalize. In 2005 people were much
more educated than in 1960. The fractions of wives (husbands) in the various educational
groups can be obtained by summing each column (row) across the rows (columns). In other
words, the marginal distributions for husbands and wives linked with the contingency tables
have changed across 1960 and 2005. The marginal distributions for females are shown in
Table 1, upper panel. The rise in educational attainment for females is readily apparent.
A standardized contingency table for the years 1960 and 2005 can be constructed to
control for this. The essential idea is that shifts in the marginal distributions across nonstandardized contingency tables can distort the comparison of the core patterns of association
between the variables in the tables. Using the iterative procedure outlined in Mosteller
(1968), a contingency table for 1960 can be computed using the 2005 marginal distributions
over educational categories for husbands and wives. Another one can be built for 2005 using

5

the 1960 marginal distributions. (These standardized contingency tables, and the method
for generating them, are presented in the appendix.) A comparison of the 1960 contingency
table from the data with the standardized one for 2005 shows an increase in assortative
mating. The (straight) sum of the diagonals rises from 0.54 to 0.60. (A comparison of 1960
standardized contingency table with the one in the data for 2005 also shows an increase
along the diagonal from 0.44 to 0.48.) The Gini coe¢ cients associated with these two
standardized tables are 0.34 and 0.35. Therefore, if people matched in 2005 according to the
1960 standardized mating pattern there would be a signi…cant reduction in income inequality;
i.e., the Gini drops from 0.43 to 0.35. The inward shift in the Lorenz curve is shown in the
righthand side panel of Figure 3.
Last, take the 1960 standardized table and additionally impose the 2005 levels of married
female labor-force participation. Likewise, force the 1960 levels of married female labor-force
participation on the 2005 standardized contingency table. Now, the Gini coe¢ cients are 0.33
and 0.44. Income inequality rises for 2005 (from 0.35 to 0.44). By shutting down married
female-labor participation for 2005 income inequality worsens. The Lorenz curve for this
experiment virtually lies on top of the one from the data for 2005 (but shifts very slightly
outward), so it is not shown in Figure 3. This illustrates the importance of married female
labor-force participation for understanding income inequality. The results of the experiments
are catalogued in Table 2. So, if people matched in 2005 according to the standardized
mating pattern observed in 1960, which showed less positive assortative matching, then
income inequality would drop because income is more diversi…ed across husband and wife.
For this e¤ect to function females need to work in 2005, as they did, or diversi…cation in
household income can’t operate.

Note: Each cell in the contingency table has two entries. In the top panel they refer to 1) the
observed matching pattern between husband and wife and 2) what would happen if matching was
random matching. In the bottom panel they denote 3) household income relative to mean income
across all households and 4) the share of the wife’s labor income in total household labor income.
Household income is adjusted by an equivalence scale to account for the di¤erences in household
size (including children) in each cell. The row marked marginal gives the fraction of females in

Data

The data used for this paper is freely available from the Integrated Public Use Microdata
Series (IPUMS) website. The samples used in this study are taken from the 1 percent sample
of the Census for the years 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000 and the American Community
Survey (ACS) for the year 2005. The following variables were included for every year: year
or the survey (variable name: year), spouse location ‡ag (sploc), number of family members
in the household (famsize), number of children in the household (nchild), age (age), sex
(sex), marital status (marst), educational attainment (educ), employment status (empstat),
total family income (ftotinc), wage and salary income (incwage). Only singles and married
couples that are 25 to 54 years old are considered. The adults in these households either live
by themselves or with their children, who are less than 19 years old. Households in which
there are other members such as grandparents, uncles/aunts, or other unrelated individuals
are excluded. Households with subfamilies of any other type are also excluded from the
analysis. Finally, widows, widowers and married individuals whose spouses are absent are
excluded as well. Income variables are restricted to be non-negative.
There are 560 types of households used in the analysis. Households are broken down into
…ner categories than are reported in the text. In principle, this doesn’t a¤ect the analysis,
since the …ner classi…cations can be combined to attain the more aggregated ones. Following
a counterfactual experiment, some households are moved into new income percentiles. So,
in practice the …ner classi…cation allows more accurate re-sorting into the various income
percentile when conducting the counterfactual experiments. Households are classi…ed into
di¤erent types as follows:
1. Marital status: married, never married males, never married females, divorced males,
divorced females.
2. Education: less than high school, high school, some college, college, more than college.
For married households, both the husband and wife will have one of these educational
levels.
12

3. Market work: work, does not work. For married households both the husband and
wife will have one of these levels of labor market activity.
4. Children: no children, 1 child, 2 children, more than 2 children.
Finally, households are divided into 10 deciles. So, for every year, there are 5,600 (i; j)combinations of household types/deciles.

4.2

The Lorenz Curve and Gini Coe¢ cient

Think of a sample of di¤erent household types, i 2 f1; 2; :::; mg, situated in di¤erent percentiles, j 2 J , of the income distribution. Again, j is expressed as a fraction. De…ne fij as
the fraction of households that are of type-i in income percentile j. Let rij represent household (i; j)’s income, yij , relative to mean income, y. Each household’s income is adjusted to
a per-adult-equivalent basis using the OECD modi…ed equivalence scale, which counts the
…rst adult as 1, the second adult as 0.5 and each child as 0.3 adults. Equivalized households
incomes are then divided by mean household income across the whole sample.
The share of income earned by percentile j is
sj =

X

fij rij :

i

The Lorenz curve is derived by plotting the cumulative shares of the population indexed by
percentile p,
p=

on the x-axis, against the cumulative share of income indexed by percentile p,

on the y-axis. Suppose that the unit interval is split up into n equally sized segments. Then,
j 2 J = f1=n;

1=n; 1g.

Take the example of n = 4 (quartiles). The Lorenz curve described above is plotted in
Figure 1. The Gini coe¢ cient associated with the Lorenz curve equals twice the area between
the Lorenz curve and the 45-degree line. Alternatively, the coe¢ cient can be calculated as
equaling 1
area

2 , where

is the area below the Lorenz Curve. In the case of quartiles the

is the summation of the areas of the right triangle A, the right trapezoids B, C, and

D. The coordinates on the x-axis are given by 0, p1 = 0:25, p2 = 0:5, p3 = 0:75, and 1:0.
The y-axis coordinates of the Lorenz curve are given by 0, l0:25 , l0:5 , l0:75 , and 1:0.

Figure A1: Lorenz Curve and the Gini Coe¢ cient
Note: The …gure shows the construction of a Lorenz curve when there are four percentiles
(quartiles). The Gini coe¢ cient is twice the area between the 45 degree line and the Lorenz curve.

Then, using the formulas for the geometric areas A, B, C, and D, the Gini coe¢ cient,
g, can be derived as

g=1

After rearranging and canceling out terms, the expression for the Gini coe¢ cient can be
simpli…ed to
g = (p1 l2

p2 l1 ) + (p2 l3
14

p3 l2 ) + (p3

l3 ):

The cumulative shares of the population, the p’s, are based on quartiles; i.e., p1 = 1=4; p2 =
2=4;

. Thus, above expression can be rewritten as
g=

1
[(l2

2l1 ) + (2l3

In the more general case of n percentiles, the Gini coe¢ cient equals

The version of this formula for an arbitrary number of income groups of any size and an
arbitrary number of sub-populations (types) is presented in Rao (1969).

Counterfactual Experiments
Imposing Random Matching

Random matching can be imposed on the demographic structure of the U.S. population for
each of these years in the sample. Counterfactual Gini coe¢ cients can then be computed.
How is this done?
First a bit of notation. Take the distribution of household, ffij g. Recall that married households are indexed by the education of the husband, the education of the wife,
their labor-force participation, and the number of children in the household. Let the sets
MEH contain the indices of all married households with a husband who has the educational level, EH 2 fHS ; HS; C ; C; C+g, where HS

refers to a less-than-high-school

educated person, HS refers to someone with a high-school education, C

is some college, C

is college, and C+ is more-than-college educated. Similarly, the sets MEW contain married
households with di¤erent educational levels for wives, EW . Furthermore, MLF PH (MLF PW )
contain all the married households with a husband’s (wife’s) labor-force participation status
LF PH(W ) 2 fW ORKH(W ) ; ~W ORKH(W ) g. Finally, the set MKIDS contain married households with a particular number of children KIDS 2 f0; 1; 2; 2+g. The set of all married
households with a particular mix of the education, MEH ;EW , for the husband and the wife
15

reads
MEH ;EW = MEH \ MEW :
Let M represent the set containing all of the di¤erent types of married households. Clearly,
M=

[

EH ;EW ;LF PH ;LF PW ;KIDS

(MEH \ MEW \ MLF PH \ MLF PW \ MKIDS );

where the term in parenthesis is the set of all married households of type (EH ; EW , LF PH ,
LF PW ; KIDS).
Here is an example illustrating how the random matching experiment is performed. Take
the …rst element of the matching table in 1960–see Table 1 of the main text. These are the
marriages where both the husband and the wife are less-than-high-school educated. In 1960,
the fraction of such marriages was 0.32. In terms of the current notation,
P

i2MHS

P

i2M

P1

P1

j=0:1

= 0:32:

Now impose the random matching table entry for these marriages–again, see Table 1 of the
main text. The fraction of such marriages, if matching in 1960 was random, is 0.21. Denote
the counterfactual distribution to be imposed in 1960 by fe1960 . The following equation must

hold for the particular marriage group being discussed

The elements in the contingency table refer to the fraction of all married households that
a particular type of match between husbands’and wives’educational levels constitutes. The
elements in the cells are totals across all income percentiles. The fij ’s refer to the fraction of
all households, married and single, that are of type i in income percentile j. Therefore, the
cells in the contingency table are aggregated over income percentiles (as well as the other
non-educational traits characterizing married households). The ratio of the total number of

16

type-(HS ; HS ) marriages under random matching to what occurs in the data is

So, under random matching the number of type-(HS ; HS ) marriages is reduced by factor
of 0:66 = 0:21=0:31. Assume that this reduction is spread out evenly across all of the income
percentiles, or across all of the j’s. Therefore, when undertaking the random matching
experiment, fe1960 should be constructed as follows:
ij

0:21 1960
f
, for i 2 MHS
feij1960 =
0:31 ij

;HS

and all j.

A similar scaling operation is performed for each of the other 24 possible matches. Thus,
there is a scaling factor speci…c to each type of marriage (in the contingency table). For all
single and divorced people, keep the original fractions; i.e., fe1960 = f 1960 .

Imposing Random Matching While Holding Fixed Married Female Labor-

Force Participation
The impact of random matching on inequality can be interacted with changes in the laborforce participation decisions of married females. The procedure for imposing random matching in 1960 is outlined in the previous section. Suppose that in addition to imposing random
matching in 1960, married female labor-force particpation is …xed at its 2005 level. How can
this be implemented?
The married female labor-force participation rate in 1960 when random matching is
imposed is

Denote the desired new counterfactual distribution for married households in 1960 by fbij1960 ,

for i 2 M and all j. This new counterfactual distribution for 1960 must give the 2005

Imposing a labor-force participation rate from 2005 onto the 1960 counterfactual distribution
of random matching amounts to scaling up all (i; j)-combinations of married households in
which women work. On the other hand, the married households in which women do not
work should be scaled down so that the total fraction of married households does not change.
Therefore, the counterfactual distribution, ffb1960 g, should be constructed in the following

Standardizing Contingency Tables

Mosteller (1968) suggests that when comparing two contingency tables they should …rst
be standardized so that they both have the same marginal distributions associated with the
rows and columns. Take a 5 5 table. It can be standardized so that each element of the two
marginal distributions is 1=5. This can be done by employing the Sinkhorn-Knopp (1967)
algorithm, which iteratively scales each row and column. Standardization preserves the core
pattern of association in a contingency table. For example, Tan, Kumar and Srivastava
(2004) note that such standardization does not a¤ect the odds ratios in a contingency table,
a typical measure used to gauge the pattern of association between variables.
4.4.1

Sinkhorn-Knopp (1967) Algorithm

1. Enter an iteration with a contingency table.
2. This contingency table has a marginal distribution associated with the rows (for men)
obtained by summing each row along its columns to obtain a total for that row. Divide
each row through by 5 times its total. The marginal distribution associated with the
rows is now (1=5; 1=5; 1=5; 1=5; 1=5).

19

3. Compute the marginal distribution associated with the columns (for women) by summing each column along its rows to obtain a total for that column. Divide each column
through by its 5 times its total.
4. Recompute the marginal distribution associated with the rows. It has changed following the previous two steps. Check its distance from the desired marginal distribution
(1=5; 1=5; 1=5; 1=5; 1=5). If it has reached the desired level of closeness then stop. If
not, go back to Step 1.
4.4.2

The Standardized Tables

The two resulting standardized tables for 1960 and 2005 are shown in Table A1. The diagonal
elements in the 2005 table are larger than in the 1960 one. Assortative mating has increased.
There is no need to standardize the tables so that each element of the marginal distributions is 1=5. One can standardize the 1960 table so that its marginal distributions
coincide with those in the data for 2005, or vice versa. This way the standardized table for
1960 (2005) can be compared with the one from the data for 2005 (1960). Both tables will
have the same 2005 (1960) marginal distributions. This results are shown in Table A2. By
comparing the standardized table for 1960 with the one in the data for 2005 (see Table 1
in the text) it can be seen that assortative mating has increased. Once again, the diagonal
elements are larger in the table for 2005. Likewise, a comparison of the standardized table
for 2005 with the one in the data for 1960 shows an increase in assortative mating (again,
see Table 1 in the text).

A Brief Literature Review

The increase in assortative mating in the U.S. has also been examined by Hou and Myles
(2008), Lam (1997), Qian and Preston (1993), and Schwartz and Mare (2005) to name a
few papers. Siow (2013) documents an increase in educational homogamy, but not a general
increase in positive assortative matching. Lam (1997) and Schwartz (2010) discuss the relationship between assortative mating and income inequality. Cancian and Reed (1998, 1999)
also focus on the role that married female-labor force participation plays in the relationship
between assortative mating and income inequality.
