Is the Fiscal Theory of the Price Level Learnable?

NBER Working Paper No. 9961

JEL No. E5, E6, D8
ABSTRACT
This paper presents a prototype model for development of the "fiscal theory of the price level." In
this simple setting, the fiscal theory's distinctiveness relies upon adoption of a bubble solution, rather
than the rational-expectations fundamentals solution. The paper then shows that the fiscal solution
is not adaptively learnable, by agents who estimate coefficients relevant for forecasting on the basis
of available data, whereas the orthodox "monetarist" solution exists and is learnable. Finally, it is
argued that similar results should be expected to apply in models that are more general in various
dimensions.

1. Introduction
During the past several years, a striking body of literature has appeared in which
it is argued that general price level determination is essentially a fiscal, rather than
monetary, phenomenon. The most prominent papers have been those of Woodford
(1994, 1995, 2001), Sims (1994, 1997), Leeper (1991), and Cochrane (1998, 2000), but
there are several others of significance.1 If the theory expounded in these papers was
valid in actuality, there would be major implications for the manner in which fiscal and
monetary policies should be conducted, not only in individual economies but also within
monetary unions.2 The purpose of the present paper is to describe this theory and provide
one major reason why I believe that it is not relevant to actual economies, but instead is
basically misleading. That position has been put forth in McCallum (2001a), but the
present argument includes a new, different, and more satisfactory justification. In
addition, the basic exposition is simplified here and several extensions are developed.
At the outset it should be emphasized just how drastically unorthodox or countertraditional the fiscal theory of price level determination is.3 Specifically, it does not
merely suggest that fiscal as well as monetary policy stances are significant for price
level behavior; instead it features a case in which only fiscal policy is relevant. In the
prototype analysis presented below, the price level moves over time in a manner that
mimics the path of government bonds outstanding and is entirely unlike the path of the
stock of high-powered money. Accordingly, it is clearly not the case that the argument

An incomplete list would include Carlstorm and Fuerst (2000), Christiano and Fitzgerald (2000),
Kocherlakota and Phelan (1999), and Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2000). Some of these are not entirely
supportive of the fiscal theory, whereas Buiter (1998, 1999, 2002) is entirely non-supportive.

On this matter, see Bergin (2000), Dupor (2000), and Sims (1997).

In what follows, I shall for brevity often refer to the latter as the “fiscal” or “fiscalist” theory.

involves fiscal behavior that drives an accommodative monetary authority, as when rapid
base money growth is adopted to finance a fiscal deficit.4 Indeed, it is this drastic aspect
of the fiscal theory that has made it a subject of great interest.5 In this regard, an
important point is that the type of model typically utilized in the literature’s analysis is
not of the overlapping generations type, in which the Ricardian equivalence proposition
is known to fail—implying that tax changes will affect price level behavior. Instead, the
model is basically of the Sidrauski-Brock type, in which Ricardian equivalence results
are normally obtained, i.e., results implying that bond-financed tax changes have no
effect on the price level or other macroeconomic variables of primary interest.6 In such a
setting, fiscalist positions are truly startling.
2. Basic Formulation
As a background for illustrating these drastic results, let us begin with an
orthodox analysis of price level determination in an extremely simple and transparent
setting.7 Suppose that the (per capita) money demand function for a closed economy is of
the textbook form
(1)

mt – pt = c0 + c1yt + c2Rt + vt

c1 > 0, c2 < 0,

where mt, pt, and yt are logs of the (base) money stock, price level, and output (income)
for period t, while Rt denotes a one-period nominal interest rate. The disturbance vt is
taken for simplicity to be white noise. It is well known that there are rigorous dynamic
general equilibrium models with optimizing agents that will justify (1) as a linear
4

Thus the theory is fundamentally different from that of Sargent and Wallace (1981).
Woodford (1995, pp. 25-26), too, has emphasized the importance of cases in which monetary and fiscal
impulses diverge so that “it is possible to see which is truly determinative.” Also see Buiter (1999) and
Cochrane (1998). Important points about the nature of traditional or monetarist views are made by Nelson
(2003) while notable attempts to distinguish empirically are made by Canzoneri, Cumby, and Diba (2001)
and Janssen, Nolan, and Thomas (2002).

approximation to a combination of implied Euler equations (first-order optimality
conditions).8 The present exposition is intended to convey the essential features of a full
optimizing analysis while ignoring some of the details.9
Furthermore, let us assume that the economy is one in which output and the real
rate of interest are constant over time. Then (1) collapses to
(2)

mt – pt = γ + α (Etpt+1 – pt) + vt

α = c2 ,

which is the familiar Cagan specification for money demand. And let us for now
consider cases in which the growth rate of the (base) money stock is kept constant by the
central bank, so that
(3)

mt = mt-1 + µ,

where µ is the growth rate of the money stock. These relations plus rational expectations
determine the behavior of pt and mt for time periods t = 1, 2, …. It is possible that the
structure was different prior to period 1.
In this setting, the orthodox bubble-free or “fundamentals” rational expectations
(RE) solution for pt can be found by conjecturing that it is of the form
(4)

pt = φ0 + φ1mt-1 + φ2vt,

since mt-1 and vt are evidently the system’s only state variables. In that case we have
Etpt+1 = φ0 + φ1(mt-1 + µ) so substitution of the latter, (3), and (4) into (2) yields
(5)

mt-1 + µ = γ + α [φ0 + φ1(mt-1 + µ)] + (1-α) [φ0 + φ1mt-1 + φ2vt] + vt.

The latter implies that for (4) to be a solution, i.e., to hold for all realizations of vt and
mt-1, we must have satisfaction of the undetermined-coefficient (UC) conditions

This section is adapted from McCallum (1999c).

Phelan (1999).

(6)

1 = αφ1 + (1−α) φ1
0 = (1−α) φ2 + 1.
µ = γ + αφ1µ + (1−α) φ0 + αφ0.

Thus we have that φ1 = 1, φ2 = − 1/(1−α) and φ0 = µ − γ − αµ, i.e., that the solution is
(7)

pt = µ(1-α) − γ + mt-1 – [1/(1−α)]vt = mt – (γ + αµ) – [1/(1−α)]vt.

Here we see that pt grows one-for-one with mt, i.e., the price level Pt moves on average in
proportion to the money stock Mt, but fluctuates relative to this average position in
response to realizations of vt. Specifically, pt is temporarily reduced by positive money
demand shocks (vt > 0) or boosted by negative shocks (vt < 0). This is clearly an entirely
traditional—one might even say “monetarist”—analysis of price level behavior in the
economy in question.
For an even simpler special case, let us next suppose that the money growth rate is
zero, i.e., that µ = 0 so that mt = m. Then the solution for pt is
(8)

pt = m − γ − vt/(1−α).

Thus, if money demand shocks were absent we would have pt = m − γ.
It must be noted, however, that while (7) and its special case (8) give the wellbehaved, orthodox, bubble-free RE solutions for this model, there are other expressions
as well that satisfy the model (2)(3) with RE. For simplicity, let us consider the special
case with constant mt = m, but now conjecture a solution of the form
(9)

pt = ψ0 + ψ1 pt-1 + ψ2vt + ψ3vt-1,

instead of pt = φ0 + φ2vt. Then working through the same type of analysis as before, one
finds that the UC conditions analogous to (6) are
9

Very recently, Evans and Honkapohja (2002b) have conducted a similar analysis in a fully optimizing

4

(10)

0 = α ψ12 + (1−α) ψ1
0 = α ψ1 ψ2 + α ψ3 + (1−α) ψ2 + 1
0 = α ψ1 ψ3 + (1−α) ψ3
m = γ + α ψ0 + α ψ1 ψ0 + (1−α) ψ0.

By inspection, therefore, we see that the first of these has two roots ψ1(1) = 0 and ψ1(2) =
(α−1)/α. If the former is the relevant root, then we find that ψ3 = 0, ψ2 = −1/(1−α), and
ψ0 = m − γ so that the same solution as in (8) is obtained. But if ψ1(2) is relevant, then ψ3
= −1/α and ψ0 = (m − γ)/α while any value of ψ2 is possible. So an infinity of solution
paths is in this case consistent with the model. Note, moreover, that ψ1(2) = (α−1)/α >
1.0, so most of these solution paths are explosive. One such path is illustrated in Figure
1, where the random component is suppressed.
Of course there are other variables and conditions besides those discussed thus far
in a fully articulated model of the economy under consideration. In particular, let Bt+1
denote the quantity of one-period government bonds purchased in t, with each bond
purchased at the price 1/(1+Rt) and redeemed in t+1 for one unit of money. Then it is
typically true that a fully-specified optimizing analysis would require that
(11)

lim
j→∞

Et βj (Mt+j + Bt+j) /Pt+j = 0,

i.e., that a transversality condition pertaining to real financial wealth must be satisfied.
Here β is a typical agent’s discount factor, β = 1/(1+ρ), with ρ > 0 so that 0 < β < 1.
We are now at last prepared to turn to the fiscalist theory. With government

setup. Their basic result agrees with the one reported here; additional results of theirs are mentioned below.

bonds recognized, we can write the consolidated10 government budget constraint (GBC)
in per capita terms as
(12)

Pt (gt – txt) = Mt+1 – Mt + (1 + Rt)-1 Bt+1 – Bt,

where gt and txt are real government purchases and (lump sum) tax collections,
respectively. In real terms, this constraint could then be expressed as
(13)

gt – txt = (Mt+1 – Mt)/Pt + (1 + Rt)-1 (Pt+1/Pt) bt+1 − bt,

where bt = Bt/Pt. The reader should note the mixed notation being utilized: bt = Bt/Pt
whereas mt = log Mt and pt = log Pt. Condition (13) obtains for t = 1, 2, ….
Now consider the special case of the economy discussed above in which Mt and
thus mt are constant. Also let the random shock vt be absent so that Pt+1 is correctly
anticipated in t and suppose that fiscal policy aims for a constant surplus txt − gt = s > 0
with gt = g. Then with the real rate of interest on bonds rt defined by 1 + rt = (1 + Rt)/(1 +
πt), where πt = (Pt+1 – Pt)/Pt, and with rt = ρ, as would be implied by optimizing behavior
in the absence of shocks,11 the government budget constraint becomes
(14)

bt+1 = (1 + ρ) bt + (1 + ρ) (gt – txt)

t = 1,2,….

But since 1 + ρ > 1.0, if gt – txt is constant the last equation reveals a strong tendency for
bt to explode as time passes. As t grows without limit, bt approaches growth at the rate ρ,
i.e., behaves like (1+ρ)t. Thus the transversality condition (11) tends to be violated since
growth of bt just offsets the shrinkage of βt = 1/(1 + ρ)t, yielding a limit that is a positive
constant.
In fact, in this case there are just two paths for bt that, with gt – tx constant, will
satisfy (14) and also (9)(10)(11) for t = 1,2,…. One of these obtains if the value b1 equals
10

The government consists of a fiscal authority and a central bank.

6

–(1 + ρ) (g – tx)/ρ, for then (14) implies that
(15)

b2 = (1 + ρ) [−(1 + ρ) (g − tx)/ρ] + (1 + ρ) (g – tx)
= (1 + ρ) (g – tx) [−(1+ρ)/ρ + 1] = −(1 + ρ) (g – tx) /ρ

and that same value prevails in all succeeding periods. But b1 = B1/P1, and B1 is the
number of nominal government bonds outstanding at the beginning of the initial period,
t = 1. Thus if the price level in this first period, P1, adjusts to equal the value P1 =
B1ρ/(1 + ρ) (tx – g), then condition (11) as well as (14) will be satisfied. Indeed, this is
precisely what the fiscalist theory predicts: that P1 adjusts relative to B1 and tx – g > 0 so
as to satisfy the individual agents’ optimality condition (11).12
But what about the necessary condition for money holdings, equation (2)? Here
the fiscalist answer is that although the path just described will not conform to the pt =
m − γ fundamentals solution implied by (8), it can and will satisfy the alternative solution
pt = [(α − 1)/α]pt-1 + (m − γ)/α for all t = 2,3,….13 The price level P1, and thus p1, is
determined by B1 and the value of b1 necessary to satisfy (11), with subsequent Pt and pt
values being given by (9) with ψ1 = (α − 1)/α. The price level explodes as time passes,
despite the constant value of Mt, but all of the model’s equilibrium conditions including
RE are satisfied nevertheless. Since Pt and Bt are growing at the same (explosive) rate,
while Mt is constant, the outcome is rightfully regarded as highly “fiscalist.”14

11

See, e.g., McCallum (1999a, 2001a), Kocherlakota and Phelan (1999), or Woodford (1995).
Note that with bt constant but positive, the government’s real revenues from bond sales are negative
(−bρ/(1+ρ)).
13
It might be asked why this relation does not determine p1 in relation to p0. Apparently the answer is
that, in the full stochastic model, it determines the value of ψ2 in (9).
14
There is a serious problem, however, with this solution if B1 is such that the implied value of P1 is
smaller than P* = Me−γ. In this case the fiscalist equilibrium does not exist because Pt approaches 0 leading
to violation of the transversality condition (11). Also, if tx – g < 0, then a negative price level would be
required for satisfaction of (14) by the assumed value of b1. This problem is stressed by Buiter (1998, p.
20).
12

Now let us consider the one other path of bt that will, with g – tx constant, satisfy
the TC (11) as well as (9), (10), and (14). It is that bt+1 = 0 for all t = 1, 2 ,…. Clearly,
(11) will be satisfied with Bt+1 = 0 and in that case places no constraint on Pt values.
Thus these are free to obey pt = m − γ, as in the special case of (9)-(10) given by (8).
Therefore this solution is the orthodox or monetarist solution.
It might be asked how the GBC (14) can be satisfied with this solution, i.e., with
Bt+1 = 0 for t = 1, 2, … and txt − g > 0. The explanation is as follows. In a market
economy, it is not legitimate to specify fiscal policy as controlling both gt and txt (with an
Mt path given) because such a policy could imply that bonds sold to the private sector
are greater than the demand for them. Thus we need to distinguish between bond supply
BSt+1 and bond demand BDt+1, and policy is appropriately specified in terms of Mt, gt, and
BSt+1 with the relevant equilibrium condition being BDt+1 ≤ BSt+1. In the case at hand, the
planned value of txt − g > 0 reflects BSt+1 plans, whereas the realized values involve Bt+1
= BDt+1 = 0 and txt − g = 0. The tx – g values realized are smaller than planned because
real revenues from bond sales are larger—zero, rather than the planned negative value
(which is −ρb1/(1 + ρ)). It is not surprising that some such adjustment is needed since the
experiment at hand has monetary (Mt) and fiscal (gt and BSt+1) policies being set
independently and exogenously. The monetarist and fiscalist solutions reflect two
different ways by which these potentially conflicting policies can be reconciled. 15
In sum, we end up with two RE solutions that represent two competing
hypotheses regarding price level behavior in the hypothetical economy under study. It is
15

For more discussion of this topic, see McCallum (2001a). For an alternative formalization, see
Kocherlakota and Phelan (1999). A somewhat different and perhaps more extreme position is that of

8

an economy in which the money stock is constant over time, all behavioral relations are
constant, and there are no stochastic disturbances impinging upon its agents or productive
processes. According to the monetarist hypothesis, the price level is constant through
time at a value that is proportional to the magnitude of the money stock, and no
government bonds are purchased by private agents.16 By contrast, the fiscalist hypothesis
implies that, despite a constant money stock, the bond stock and the price level both
explode as time passes—but without violating any optimality condition for private
agents. This happens because the initial price level adjusts relative to the initial bond
stock so as to make the real bond stock equal the single non-zero value that will permit
the stock of real bonds to remain constant and the transversality condition (11) to be
satisfied. Under this latter hypothesis, the initial price level is proportional to the initial
bond stock and the price level grows in tandem with the bond stock.
The crucial issue is, which of the two solutions provides the better guide to
reality, i.e., to price level behavior in actual economies? In previous writings (McCallum
1999a, 2001a) I have emphasized that the traditional equilibrium is the “fundamentals” or
“bubble-free” solution provided by the minimum-state-variable (MSV) solution concept
for RE models, whereas the fiscalist solution represents a bubble solution.17 I have
suggested that this is a plausible reason—in addition to the empirical evidence—for
preferring the former, but it must be recognized that for many analysts that argument may
not be persuasive.18 Accordingly, the next section of the present paper will develop a
Buiter (1998, p. 17), who argues that the fiscalist assumptions “violate the normal rules for constructing a
well-posed general equilibrium model.”
16
This does not imply that none are offered for sale by the government.
17
The MSV solution concept is extensively discussed by McCallum (1999b). It is crucial to recognize that
in linear models the MSV solution is, by definition and by construction, unique.
18
For example, Woodford (2001, p. 701) argues that “what constitutes a ‘bubble equilibrium’ is often in the
eye of the beholder….”

9

more substantive theoretical reason to view the traditional MSV solution as economically
relevant, and the fiscalist solution as irrelevant. This reason is based on the intimatelyrelated concepts of E-stability and least-squares learnability.
3. E-Stability and Learnability
Iterative E-stability was developed in the 1980s, principally by Evans (1985,
1986), and then modified in response to work by Marcet and Sargent (1989). Iterative Estability involves a thought experiment in which one conceives of expectational behavior
with anticipated variables such as pet+1 being described by an expression of a form that
would be appropriate under RE, but with parameter values that are initially incorrect.19
This “expectation function” implies, when substituted into the model of the economy, a
law of motion that entails systematic expectational errors. So one can then conceive of
revised values of the parameters of the expectation function that are suggested by the law
of motion. These too will imply incorrect forecasts, but one can imagine continuing with
a series of iterations and consider whether they will converge to a specific RE solution,
be it the MSV or a non-MSV solution.20 If such a process converges to a particular
solution, then the latter is said to be iteratively E-stable.
To illustrate the concept of iterative E-stability, let us consider an example that is
similar to the model of Section 2 with mt = m. Thus suppose that some unspecified
variable yt is generated by the structural model
(16)

yt = a0 + a1 Etyt+1 + ut,

where ut = ξut-1 + εt with ξ< 1 and εt being white noise. With this specification, the
usual “fundamentals” RE solution will be of the form
19
20

Here pet+1 denotes the subjective expectation of pt+1 formed at time t, not necessarily according to RE.
If there is convergence, it will be to some RE solution.

10

(17)

yt = φ0 + φ1ut,

but suppose that agents do not “initially” know the true values of the φj parameters. If at
any date t the agents’ prevailing belief is that their values are φ0(n) and φ1(n), then the
perceived law of motion (PLM) will be21
(18)

yt = φ0(n) + φ1(n)ut,

and the implied expectation of yt+1 will be
(19)

φ0(n) + φ1(n)ξut.

But using this expression in place of Etyt+1 in (16)—which implies temporarily
abandoning RE—gives
(20)

yt = a0 + a1[φ0(n) + φ1(n)ξut] + ut

as the system’s actual law of motion (ALM). Now imagine a sequence of iterations from
the PLM to the ALM. Writing the left-hand side of (20) in the form (18) for iteration n+1
gives φ0(n+1) + φ1(n+1)ut = a0 + a1[φ0(n) + φ1(n)ξut] + ut and therefore implies that
(21a) φ0(n+1) = a0 + a1φ0(n)
(21b) φ1(n+1) = a1φ1(n)ξ + 1.
The issue, then, is whether iterations defined by (21) are such that the φj(n) converge to
the φj values in (17) as n → ∞. For this simple example, it can be seen by inspection that
necessary and sufficient conditions for such convergence are |a1 | < 1 and |ξa1 | < 1. If
these conditions hold, then the solution (17) is said to be iteratively E-stable. Evans
(1986) found that in several prominent and controversial examples the MSV solution is
iteratively E-stable.

21

Here n is being used to index iterations in an eductive process of learning in meta-time.

11

By considering ever smaller “time periods” for iterations of the foregoing type
one can develop a related process that is continuous in notional time (meta-time).22
Evans and Honkapohja (1999, 2001) emphasize this unqualified notion of E-stability
because it is, under fairly general conditions, equivalent to learnability in actual time by
means of a least-squares-based adaptive process.23 Absence of E-stability therefore
implies that a particular RE solution will not be obtained if agents are not endowed with
knowledge of the model’s true parameters, but attempt to learn them by statistical
estimation based on data generated to date, with updating and re-estimation taking place
each period. Of course this conclusion presumes that the statistical processing at each
date is of the least-squares type, but that is a distinctly reasonable way for the agents to
proceed; the general idea is that if this process does not permit agents to acquire
knowledge of the true parameter values then they are unlikely to do so by other
processes. Technical results pertaining to the near-equivalence between E-stability and
least-squares learnability are described in detail by Evans and Honkapohja (1999, 2001).
4. Application to Fiscal Theory
Here our objective is to develop E-stability results for the model of Section 2 with
mt = m. Specifically, we want to determine whether either, or both, of the solutions given
by equations (9)-(10) features E-stability and thus least-squares learnability. We can
make a start by writing the model in question in as
(22)

pt = [α/(α−1)] Etpt+1 + (m−γ)/(1−α) + [1/(α−1)]vt,

which is of the same form as that examined in Section 3 with the parameter a1 in (16)
equal to α/(α−1) and vt = ξvt-1 + white noise. Therefore, with α < 0 we have 0 < a1 < 1, so
22

Evans (1989) and Evans and Honkapohja (1992) adopted the unqualified concept following results
described in Marcet and Sargent (1989).

12

for any ξ such that | ξ | < 1, the MSV solution based on ψ1(1) = 0 in (10) is iteratively Estable. That does not establish, however, that solutions based on ψ1(2) = (α−1)/α, which
include the fiscal solution, are not E-stable.
Fortunately, however, this model is a particular version of one case studied by
Evans (1986), which shows that with 0 < a1 < 1, the MSV solution based on ψ1(1) is
recursively E-stable whereas the non-MSV solutions involving ψ1(2) = (α−1)/α are not
recursively E-stable (1986, p. 153) under parameter values that include ours. These
results were shown also to hold for unqualified E-stability by Evans (1989, pp. 311-312).
Recently, moreover, a very thorough analysis of that model was provided by Evans and
Honkapohja (2002a), who consider still more solutions—ones of the “resonant frequency
sunspot” type. Their finding is that equilibria reflecting this latter type of phenomena
will be E-stable only if the coefficient analogous to α/(α−1) in (22) satisfies α/(α−1) <
−1. But with α < 0, that is not possible in the model at hand.
It remains to be settled whether this case is one for which E-stability goes hand in
hand with least-squares learnability. The basic result, established by Evans and
Honkapohja (2001, pp. 231-235), is that E-stable solutions that are dynamically stable
(i.e., non-explosive) are learnable, whereas E-unstable solutions are not. Therefore, the
traditional monetarist solution is, and the fiscalist solution is not, learnable by adaptive
least-squares procedures in the model of Section 2. This is the basic result of the present
paper.24

23

The link is tighter when the solution in question is dynamically stable, i.e., non-explosive.
More recently, Evans and Honkapohja (2002b) have considered the fiscal-theory issue specifically in a
fully optimizing, nonlinear formulation. Their conclusion for the basic case corresponding to the one of

24

5. Generalization of Basic Result
Ignoring stochastic terms, the linear model that we have used to this point can be
represented graphically as in Figure 1. There the traditional MSV solution is that pt = p*,
as at the intersection point, in each period, t = 1, 2, …. The fiscalist solution, by contrast,
implies pt values given by paths such as that of the thin line in Figure 1. Most of the
literature has, however, utilized explicitly optimizing models that imply an analogous
diagram as shown in Figure 2, where there is a nonlinear Pt to Pt+1 mapping that has an
positive but increasing slope. Such diagrams are featured, for example, by Carlstrom and
Fuerst (2001), Kocherlakota and Phelan (1999), McCallum (2001a), and Christiano and
Fitzgerald (2000). Does the E-stability analysis of the foregoing section carry over to
specifications such as these?
Although there are some qualifications, the answer is basically “yes.” The main
point is that E-stability is a local concept, so that conclusions pertaining to the MSV
solution in Figure 1 carry over to models of the type in Figure 2. Thus the MSV solution
is E-stable. Also, considerable progress toward analysis of non-MSV solutions is
reported by Evans and Honkapohja (2001, pp. 267-314). These results are
predominately, though not entirely, favorable to the notion that non-MSV solutions are
not learnable. In any case, the more recent analysis of Evans and Honkapohja (2002b)
obtains the same result in a nonlinear model, as mentioned in the preceding footnote.
But other kinds of additional generality are needed, as well. The model that we
have used features full price level flexibility and many other simplifications that would
not be found in reality. It is of course impossible to generate strict conclusions under

this section is that “the explosive fiscalist price path is unstable under learning” (2002b, p.7)—i.e., is not
LS learnable.

14

assumptions of great generality, but it would appear that the basic line of argument
provided above would carry over to almost any model that includes a money demand
specification of the same general type as (1), where the essential features are that real
money demand depends positively upon real transactions and negatively upon an
opportunity-cost variable such as Rt that is the difference between the real rates of return
on money and other assets. For in any model that includes such a relationship, the
behavior of the price level will not depart drastically from that of the money stock except
along explosive paths. With non-explosive money supply behavior these will be bubble
paths—i.e., non-MSV paths. But the literature on E-stability indicates that the type of
result found above, that the MSV solution is E-stable and the other solutions are not,
obtains in virtually all cases involving well-motivated, plausible models. Evans and
Honkapohja (1999, 2001) report and emphasize some exceptions, but the main examples
stem from their (1992) paper. In McCallum (2002, 2003), I argue that these examples
reflect implausible economic specifications—models that are not “well formulated.” It is
my impression that there is a very strong association in well formulated models between
E-stability and MSV solutions—which implies that (non-explosive) MSV solutions are
learnable. Non-MSV solutions, by contrast, are typically E-unstable and not learnable by
adaptive least-squares procedures.
In a very recent paper, Evans and Honkapohja (2002b) have examined a broader
class of policy regimes, following the specification introduced by Leeper (1991). In this
case the monetary authority adjusts a one-period nominal interest rate instrument
according to a rule of the form
(23)

Rt = µ0 + (1 + µ1)∆pt + θt

15

while simultaneously the fiscal authority is holding gt = 0 and implementing a (lumpsum) tax rule of the form
(24)

txt = τ0 + τ1bt + ζt.

Leeper (1991) classified monetary policy as “active” if |(1 + µ1)β| > 1 and as “passive”
otherwise, and classified fiscal policy as active if |β−1 − τ1| > 1 and passive otherwise.
Evans and Honkapohja use this terminology, but sensibly focus on cases in which 1 + µ1
> 0 and τ1> 0. It seems somewhat unsatisfactory to represent monetary policy in terms of
an interest rate rule when the purpose of the analysis is to contrast fiscal and monetary
theories of price-level determination.25 But let us continue the discussion nevertheless.
Using a linearized version of their model, Evans and Honkapohja (2002b) find
that there are two types of solutions that correspond in several ways to the notion of
monetarist and fiscalist solutions. For example, in their monetarist solution the inflation
rate depends only upon a constant and θt, the current monetary policy shock, whereas the
fiscalist solution has the inflation rate also depending on the previous period’s real bond
stock. For the most part, the monetarist solution is E-stable and LS learnable when
monetary policy is active and fiscal policy passive, whereas the fiscalist solution is Estable and LS learnable when monetary policy is passive and fiscal policy is active. This
finding supports the position of Sims (1994) and Leeper (1991) that it is possible for
fiscal policy-rule settings to influence the behavior of inflation, and in this sense to
support claims of the fiscal-theory proponents. But the finding does not overturn the
arguments given two paragraphs above. Specifically, when the fiscalist solution is Estable and dynamically stable, it involves stable behavior for real money balances and

16

therefore implies no major divergence in the time paths of the money stock and the price
level. Such solutions evidently represent cases in which monetary policy is
accommodating fiscal policy requirements and therefore represent outcomes that are fully
consistent with traditional monetary analysis. There is a small region of the policy
parameter space that leads to E-stability with explosive solutions, which would imply
explosive behavior of real money balances and thus be inconsistent with monetarist
doctrines. But these solutions also involve explosive behavior of the real bond stock,26
which would seem to imply the failure of transversality conditions that are necessary for
individual optimality.27
From a realistic perspective, emphasis should instead be given to the region in
which (1 + µ1)β > 1 and ρ < τ1 < 1 + ρ, for the following reasons. The former condition
represents the “Taylor principle” in the model at hand,28 while the latter calls for taxes at
a rate that would be nonexplosive in the absence of any government revenue from money
creation and yet not so large as to imply that taxes in a single period would more than

25

This statement does not claim that monetary policy cannot be satisfactorily managed by means of an
interest rate rule, and certainly does not deny that policy is so conducted by most actual central banks.
26
In the analysis of Evans and Honkapohja (2002b), the solution equations pertain to ∆pt and bt so both of
these are explosive.
27
Woodford (2003) suggests that the Evans and Honkapohja (2002b) designation of monetarist and fiscalist
solutions does not always correspond to the solution promoted by advocates of the fiscal theory of the price
level. In this context, Woodford states that “the central contention” of the fiscal theory is “that under
certain policy regimes consistency of the inflation rate with intertemporal government solvency should be
an important factor in determining inflation, in addition to the specification of monetary policy.” In the
present paper, however, the essence of the fiscalist position is taken to be a prediction that the price level
will, under some circumstances, behave like nominal bonds and very differently than the nominal money
supply. It is that type of prediction that has made the fiscalist theory striking and prominent.
28
Considerable discussion of the Taylor Principle is provided by Woodford (2002), who emphasizes that a
smaller value of µ1 will suffice when µ2 > 0. In the analysis of Evans and Honkapohja (2002b),
incidentally, a slightly different condition is found—but it appears that this is merely the result of a loglinear approximation (used commonly but not by them) that serves to eliminate a β term that should appear
in the discrete-time version of the Fisher equation.

fully retire all outstanding government debt.29 The main result is that, over this entire
region, the monetarist solution is E-stable (and the fiscalist solution is not). This result is
especially interesting in that it indicates that desirable outcomes are provided by
monetary and fiscal policy rules that are each sensible on their own terms, with no overt
“coordination” or dependence on the behavior of the other policy authority.
6. Additional Issue
The possibility of price level behavior being dominated by fiscal, rather than
monetary, policy stances is the hallmark of the fiscal theory. But there is an additional
theme in the literature that deserves brief discussion. This is the occasional appearance
of an analysis conducted in the context of a model that does not include any asset with
medium of exchange (MOE) properties, i.e., any money. Such discussions have been
provided, for example, by Cochrane (1998, 2001), Weil (2002), and Woodford (2002,
Ch. 2).
The problem with such analyses is that they undermine the very raison d’etre of
the fiscal theory. Suppose the model economy has two or more paper assets, one of
which is called “money” but has no MOE properties—i.e., does not serve to facilitate
transactions in a resource-conserving manner. Then the model pertains to a non-monetary
economy, in which case there is nothing surprising or interesting about equilibria in
which the price level fails to mimic the behavior of this useless and misnamed asset.
Alternatively, suppose that the model recognizes only one paper asset issued by
the government that can be thought of either as “bonds” or “money” as, for example, in
Weil (2002). In such settings the behavior of the price level, if it is defined as the asset

29

It seems peculiar that Leeper’s (1991) terminology would classify this type of fiscal behavior—retiring
each period a positive fraction of outstanding debt—as “passive,” but it does.

18

price of goods, will be determined by fiscal policy since the latter governs the creation of
that paper asset. But in such a setting there is no distinction between fiscal and monetary
policy, so again fiscalist results lose their interest; one could just as well describe
management of that asset’s supply as representing monetary policy. In short, a necessary
condition for fiscalist results to be of interest is that they occur in models that include
both government bonds and MOE money as distinct assets, so that monetary and fiscal
policies can conceivably push in different directions.30
7. Conclusions
Let us conclude with a brief recapitulation of the paper’s argument. Basically, it
presents a prototype model, in the simplest possible setting, for development and
discussion of the fiscal theory of the price level. In this setting, it becomes clear that the
fiscal theory’s distinctiveness relies upon the analyst’s adoption of a bubble solution,
rather than the orthodox fundamentals solution, in the context of a multiplicity of rational
expectations solutions for the model. It is this step that permits the time path of the price
level to depart dramatically from the time path of the money stock, despite the model’s
inclusion of an orthodox money demand function (as is standard in the literature). To
determine which equilibrium is plausible, the paper adopts the criterion of adaptive, leastsquares learnability (since individual agents could not plausibly be endowed with perfect
knowledge of the economy’s true parameter values). By drawing on results developed in
the extensive writings of Evans and Honkapohja (1999, 2001, 2002a) it is demonstrated
30

Does this argument deny any importance to analyses designed to analyze price level determination in
non-monetary economies? No, but in that context, the meaning of the term “price level” becomes an issue.
Normally it is the inverse of the exchange value of money, so what is the appropriate definition for an
economy without any MOE? It does in fact seem likely that some asset would serve as a common medium
of account (MOA) in such an economy, although we have little or no recent experience with such matters,
and a government-issued paper asset would be a natural candidate to fill that role. But, in any event,
matters of this type need to be explicitly addressed in such analyses.

19

that with the basic policy specification the traditional fundamentals solution is E-stable
and therefore learnable, whereas the fiscal-theory bubble solution is not. It is argued that
similar results are likely to prevail in more complex models that include the same central
ingredients, including policy rules.
With regard to the type of policy specification proposed by Leeper (1991), the
paper discusses some results obtained recently by Evans and Honkapohja (2002b). It is
argued that these results are basically consistent with the message of the paper. One
debatable point is that some writers, including Woodford (2003), identify the central
characteristic of the fiscal theory differently—see footnote 27 above. Our
characterization of the fiscal theory, as emphasized above, is that it leads in some cases to
the prediction of price level paths that are dominated by bond stock behavior and very
different from the path of the nominal money stock. It is this notion, I suggest, that has
been most responsible for attracting attention to the fiscal theory.
Finally, the paper argues that analyses of the fiscal theory of the price level must
be conducted in models with a medium-of-exchange money to avoid undermining the
raison d’etre of the theory.
