Adjusting to Trade Policy: Evidence from U.S. Antidumping Duties on Vietnamese Catfish

NBER Working Paper No. 14495
November 2008, Revised December 2011
JEL No. F13,F14
ABSTRACT
In 2003, after claims of dumping, the U.S. imposed heavy tariffs on imports of catfish from Vietnam.
As a result, Vietnamese exports of catfish to the U.S. market sharply declined. Using a panel data of
Vietnamese households, we explore the responses of catfish producers in the Mekong delta between
2002 and 2004. We study adjustments not only in catfish aquaculture but also in other economic activities.
We find that, over this period, the rate of income growth was significantly lower among households
relatively more involved in catfish farming in 2002. The source of this slower growth is explained
by a relative decline in both catfish income and revenues from other miscellaneous farms activities
such as poultry and livestock farming. Households did not adjust labor supply, most likely because
of off-farm employment limitations. We also document that households more exposed to the shock
reduced the share of investment assigned to catfish, while substituting into agriculture.

Introduction

The number of antidumping (AD) cases filed with the World Trade Organization tripled
between the early 1980s and the late 1990s (Prusa, 2005). The number of AD users has increased as well, and today countries such as India, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, South Africa
and New Zealand have become users as frequent as the United States, the European Union,
Canada and Australia. Forty-six countries adopted AD laws between 1990 and 2001 (Zanardi, 2004). Overall, AD activity is increasing and likely to continue increasing in the near
future.
There is a large empirical literature on antidumping (see Blonigen and Prusa, 2003).
Debaere (2005) and Prusa (1997) study changes in international equilibrium prices, while
Blonigen and Haynes (2002) and Blonigen and Park (2004) explore the pass-through to
domestic prices. Bown and Crowley (2007), Staiger and Wolak (1994), and Prusa (1997)
document changes in trade volumes, trade deflection and trade depression. In turn, Gallaway, Blonigen and Flynn (1999) quantify aggregate welfare costs and Blonigen and Bown
(2003) focus on issues of retaliation and further trade liberalization. In this paper, we are
interested in exploring the impact of AD measures (adopted by developed countries) on
income-generating activities of rural households in developing countries. In light of the increasingly heavy use of AD, our estimates of these microeconomic impacts should become
valuable additions to the set of current evaluations of AD policies.
The concrete case at the core of our paper is the antidumping duties imposed by the
United States on imports of catfish fillets from Vietnam in 2003. After the U.S. lifted the
embargo on Vietnam in 1994, Vietnamese catfish burst into the U.S. market, which by
2

2002 became the main export destination and accounted for 50 percent of total production.
Catfish farming quickly became an important source of income for households in the Mekong
delta in Southern Vietnam. However, such form of aquaculture is also an important industry
in the Southern United States (mainly in Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, and Louisiana).
The Association of Catfish Farmers of America (CFA), faced with an increasing competition
from cheaper Vietnamese catfish, and deeming such competition unfair, initiated a successful
campaign to halt catfish imports. First, the CFA pursued a labeling campaign whereby
Vietnamese products were forced to be sold as ‘tra’ and ‘basa,’ a different product from the
American ‘channel’ catfish. Later, the CFA launched dumping allegations. In January 2003,
the U.S. Department of Commerce (DoC) ruled in favor of the dumping claim of the CFA
and established tariffs ranging from 37 to 64 percent on imports of frozen catfish (that is, tra
and basa) from Vietnam. In July 2003, the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC)
ratified the DoC ruling. As a result, Vietnamese exports of catfish to the U.S. plummeted
to the point of being almost completely shut down.
Our objective in this paper is to explore patterns of household adjustment to this AD
shock among Mekong farmers in Vietnam. In world markets where export barriers abound
(sometimes intertwined with export preferences), one of the main concerns with the trade
policies of developed countries is how such policies affect welfare in trade partners in the
developing world. For this reason, we focus here on adjustments in the process of generation
of household income. We first establish the overall response of household income to the U.S.
AD policy among catfish farmers in the Mekong. We also document how income adjustment
takes place in the presence of potential spillovers from the activities directly affected by the

3

trade shocks (catfish in our case) to other household occupations (such as agriculture). To
do this, we investigate the impact on various sources of household income, and we inspect
household adjustments in input decisions such as labor supply and investment in catfish and
non-catfish activities.
Our identification strategy is based on the comparison of household outcomes before and
after the U.S. AD intervention across catfish farmers with different levels of exposure to the
shock. As our measure of exposure, we use fishing income shares as proxies for catfish income
shares and we exploit the regional variation in exposure generated by the fact that catfish
thrives only in a few provinces of the Mekong delta. This regional heterogeneity in catfish
exposure also allows us to produce several successful validation results lend support to our
identification strategy.
The Vietnamese catfish case is ideal for ex-post analysis. First, the 2003 U.S. decision
is a trade shock which is arguably exogenous with respect to decisions taken by Vietnamese
households. Second, the General Statistical Office in Vietnam collected two household surveys, the Vietnam Household Living Standard Surveys of 2002 and 2004, that span the
period right before and after the U.S. trade policy. The combination of an exogenous policy
change with ex-ante and ex-post data provides a unique opportunity to explore household
responses to trade shocks. There are only few other studies that analyze ex-post the impact of trade policies on household income and production decisions. Edmonds and Pavcnik
(2005) find that the increase in the price of rice that followed market integration in Vietnam
led to declines in child labor, especially in households that were large net producers of rice.
Topalova (2005) studies the impact on poverty and inequality of trade liberalization in India

4

in the early 1990s and finds that rural areas with industries more exposed to liberalization
experienced less poverty reduction. For the same Indian liberalization process, Edmonds,
Pavcnik, and Topalova (2009) find that areas with more concentration of protected industries saw a lower increase in schooling and a lower decline in child labor. Finally, McCaig
(2008) studies the impact of the 2001 U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement on poverty
and finds that areas more affected by U.S. tariff cuts experienced larger declines in poverty.
We find that income growth was significantly lower for farmers more dependent on catfish
income. Our preferred estimates show that, relative to households with only marginal involvement in catfish production, the average catfish farmer faced a 15.8 percent lower growth
in total income (standard error 5.7 percent). The impact was instead 8.7 percent (s.e. 3.3)
for households with low exposure and 23.6 percent (s.e. 8.0) for high-exposure farmers.
Consistently with these results, the growth in catfish income was significantly lower
among farmers more exposed to the AD shock. We also find evidence of spillovers of the
AD shock to non-catfish activities. While growth in wage and agricultural income were not
affected, growth in income from miscellaneous farm activities (such as poultry, livestock and
farm services) was negatively associated with exposure, and such association was both statistically and economically significant. In addition, growth in investment in catfish farming
was significantly lower for households more exposed to the shock. The same was true for
investments in miscellaneous farm activities, although in this case our estimates are large but
not statistically significant. On the other hand, Mekong farmers shifted resources into agricultural investments, and we find that households more exposed to the shock saw relatively
larger rates of growth along this dimension.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we illustrate the timeline of the
U.S. antidumping measures on Vietnamese catfish. In section 3, we describe the production
of catfish in Vietnam and we characterize the catfish farmers of the Mekong delta. In section
4, we introduce our estimation strategy and we document the changes in household income.
In section 5, we explore the pattern of household adjustment to the trade shock. Finally,
section 6 concludes.

The US Antidumping Ruling on Vietnamese Catfish

Catfish is a fresh-water fish that thrives in large, flat rivers. In the U.S., catfish is raised in
man-made ponds mainly in the states of Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, and Louisiana.1
Farmers buy fingerlings (young fish) and feed them for approximately ten weeks. Processing
plants purchase farm-raised catfish and market mostly fresh or frozen fillets in about equal
parts. The catfish industry is by far the largest farm-raised fishing sector in the U.S. In
1999, it accounted for 80 and 64 percent of aquaculture production in volume and value,
generating 440 million dollars of revenue (USITC, 2001). There are over 1,000 catfish farms
and 25 processing plants in the Southeast. Most of the catfish produced in the U.S. is a
high quality variety known as channel catfish, which, before the introduction of Vietnamese
catfish, accounted for almost all domestic consumption (with total imports of less than 1
percent).
The Hau and Tien rivers in the Mekong region of South Vietnam also provide a good
1

There is also some production of catfish in California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Missouri, North
Carolina, and Texas.

6

habitat for catfish. The Vietnamese varieties, known as basa and tra, are raised by small
farmers in cages that are placed in the river itself and later processed in industrialized plants.
While tra is of lower quality than basa in terms of flavor and texture, it is faster, easier,
and less costly to raise and has become the most popular of the two species among Mekong
producers.
In 1995, soon after the end of the U.S. embargo, Vietnam started exporting frozen fillets
of basa and tra to the U.S. market.2 As a first effort to popularize the Vietnamese products,
more appealing names such as River Cobbler and China Sole were used to market the fish.
Later on, retailers labeled basa and tra simply as catfish. They also adopted brand names
that suggested a Mississippi-raised origin, such as Cajun Delight Catfish, and used packaging
similar to the American channel catfish.
During the late 1990s and early 2000s, catfish exports from Vietnam increased significantly. By 2000-2002, approximately 50 percent of the total Vietnamese production of catfish
was being sold to the U.S., and the volume market share in U.S. consumption reached 8.4
percent in 2000 and 19.6 percent in 2002. Vietnamese catfish served mostly food service
distributors and chain restaurants—catfish available in supermarkets, on the other hand, is
mostly fresh instead of frozen and thus of American origin. The average price of domestic
catfish sold by U.S. processors fell by 18 percent between 2000 and 2002, from 2.75 to 2.25
dollars per pound. In turn, during the same time period, Vietnamese production capacity
expanded by 100 percent (USITC, 2003).
2

The embargo was lifted by the Clinton administration in February 1994 as a first step before reestablishing diplomatic relations in July 1995 and signing a bilateral trade agreement in December 2001.
The 2001 trade agreement granted Vietnam the Most Favored Nation (MFN) status.

7

The increasing popularity of Vietnamese catfish together with the decrease in domestic
prices raised concern within the Association of Catfish Farmers of America (CFA), a trade
association of farmers and processors. At first, the CFA blamed the improper labeling of
Vietnamese basa and tra as ‘catfish’ for the lower prices. The allegation was that even
though Vietnamese catfish was a different product from American catfish, it was sold under
misleading labels that allowed Vietnamese exporters to free ride on the significant commercial
campaign and marketing efforts of domestic catfish producers.3 Domestic producers launched
a “raised in America” campaign to raise awareness among clients and consumers.
The CFA also lobbied in Washington. In October 2001, the U.S. House of Representatives
adopted a new bill (H.R. 2964) which established the use of the label ‘catfish’ only for fishes of
the Ictaluridae family (the American catfish), thus forcing Vietnamese exports to be labeled
as tra and basa. Subsequently, the 10-digit Harmonized System line corresponding to frozen
catfish fillets, 0304.20.60.30, was split into three different lines: 0304.20.60.32 for catfish of
the Ictaluridae family; 0304.20.60.33 for catfish of the Pangasiidae family (the Vietnamese
catfish); and 0304.20.60.34 for all other siluriformes. The passing of the bill, however,
did not lead to a significant recovery in prices. While public awareness increased, most
Vietnamese catfish was being sold to American wholesale distributors, not final consumers,
and a change in names was not enough to break the commercial networks that had already
been established.4
3

Strictly, the term “catfish” refers to the order Siluriformes. There are 39 different families of catfish, including the family Ictaluridae and the family Pangasiidae. The American channel catfish (Ictalurus
punctatus) is a species in the Ictaluridae family, while the Vietnamese basa (Pangasius bocourti ) and tra
(Pangasius hypophthalmus) are species in the Pangasiidae family.

For more details on labeling issues and a general description of the evolution of imports of Vietnamese
catfish see USITC (2003) and Seafood Business Magazine (2001).

In June 2002, the CFA filed a dumping lawsuit against Vietnam. A few months later,
in January 2003, the U.S. DoC ruled in favor of U.S. farmers, arguing that Vietnamese
exporters were dumping frozen fish fillets on U.S. markets by margins that varied by exporter
and ranged from 37 to 64 percent of the “normal value.”5 When the exporting country is
a “market economy,” the DoC determines the normal value of an imported product using
either the domestic price or an estimate of the cost of production in the country of origin.
Vietnam, however, is considered as a “non-market economy” by the U.S. government, which
implies the presumption that domestic prices are distorted. As a consequence, prices and
costs in a surrogate country are used instead. In the case of Vietnamese catfish, the surrogate
countries used by the DoC were Bangladesh and India. As the last step of the lawsuit, in July
2003, the USITC found that American catfish processors were materially injured by imports
from Vietnam, confirming the application of antidumping import tax rates equivalent to the
dumping margins of 37 to 64 percent.6
Figure 1 plots the time series of U.S. imports of tra and basa from Vietnam (in tons)
between January 2002 and July 2004. Data are from the disaggregated monthly import series
at the 10-digit level of the Harmonized System.7 The graph shows a striking drop in the
imported quantities of tra and basa immediately following the DoC announcement in January
2003 (left vertical line). Average monthly imports dropped from nearly 380 monthly tons in
2002, to around 180 in the first semester of 2003, a more than 50 percent decline. After the
5

The DoC established margins of 36.84 percent for Vinh Hoan, 45.55 percent for Afiex, CAFATEX, Da
Nang, Mekonimex, QVD, Viet Hai and Vinh Long, 45.81 percent for CATACO, 47.05 percent for Agifish,
53.68 percent for Nam Viet, and 63.88 percent of all other exporters.
6
The USITC decided to exclude American catfish farmers from the investigation on material injury, and
focused only on catfish processors. The argument was that the percentage of unprocessed domestic farmraised catfish that was used as input for frozen fillets, which was about 50 percent, was not high enough.

changes in import are consistent with the literature: Staiger and Wolak (1994) document
similar drops in U.S. imports during the investigation phase in several antidumping cases
and Prusa (2001) estimate overall drops of about 50 percent in U.S. AD-subject imports.

Catfish Farming in the Mekong

Fishing and aquaculture are prevalent all over Vietnam, a country with a dense river network and hundreds of kilometers of coastal areas. While marine fishing, both offshore and
inshore, are important, our analysis focuses on small-scale aquaculture production by Viet-

10

namese farmers. Within aquaculture, there are three major fishing activities in the country:
freshwater aquaculture (river fishing), brackish water aquaculture (medium-salinity waters
as in estuaries) and marine aquaculture (saltwater). Since catfish is a river fish, we will only
study freshwater aquaculture.
To investigate the impact of the U.S. antidumping duties on Vietnamese farmers, we focus
on households residing in provinces where catfish production is concentrated. We will label
these provinces, which are located in the Mekong region of South Vietnam, ‘catfish provinces’.
Data on fish production by species in Vietnam is not easily available to the public. In order
to identify the catfish provinces, we must therefore follow an indirect approach consisting of
two strategies. First, we examine the geography of the country and the ecological conditions
needed for catfish production across regions. Second, we present supporting information on
catfish production by provinces that we obtained from various sources.
Within Vietnam, the production of catfish is geographically concentrated in the Mekong
Delta. This is because catfish only develops in relatively flat rivers with sandy soils, a
prevalent feature of the Mekong area. The Red River Delta, in North Vietnam, is instead
a mountainous region not suitable for catfish, but rather for other fish like carp. The other
regions specialize mostly in brackish and saltwater products. Table 1 supports this claim.
Based on the description of the sector in World Bank (2005)—a comprehensive report on
Vietnam Aquaculture—we assembled evidence on region-specific forms of aquaculture. Two
observations stand out. First, freshwater production is relevant in all North Vietnam and,
within the South, only in the Mekong where 50 percent of the aquatic output comes from
freshwater fishing. In addition, while the Mekong produces tra and basa (along with other fish

11

like tilapia and barb) the North, and in particular the Red River, specializes in carp (common,
Indian and Chinese). The main brackish aquaculture product is shrimp, particularly in the
non-Mekong South, together with mollusks, crabs, mussels, scallops, and clams. Saltwater
aquaculture involves mostly grouper and cobia. These observations establish that catfish is
only produced in the Mekong region.
Even within the Mekong region, there is considerable heterogeneity in the composition
of aquaculture production. While landlocked provinces specialize in freshwater aquaculture,
coastal provinces tend to be more heavily engaged in brackish and saltwater aquaculture.
Also, suitable river conditions for catfish farming are more prevalent in some provinces than
in others. To see why, Figure 2 displays a map of the Mekong area and its provinces. Some
Mekong provinces (Kien Giang, Ca Mau, Bac Lieu, Soc Trang, Tra Vinh, and Ben Tre) have
extensive marine coastlines. Instead, the provinces of An Giang, Can Tho, Dong Thap, Vinh
Long, Long An, and Tien Giang are mostly landlocked. The Mekong river, where catfish
thrives, flows down from Cambodia and enters Vietnam at the border between An Giang
and Dong Thap. The river then divides into the Hau branch, which crosses the Can Tho
province, and the Tien branch, which crosses Tien Giang and Vinh Long provinces. The
Mekong finally empties into the sea mostly in the provinces of Soc Trang and Tra Vinh. The
catfish habitat is concentrated in the provinces more heavily touched by the Mekong River.
Table 2 includes information on aquaculture production for each province in the Mekong
region.8 Columns 1 and 4 show the share of freshwater aquaculture in total aquaculture
8

Data have been gathered from difference sources, which include the Ministry of Fisheries (www.
fistenet.gov.vn) and seafood industry magazines such as Seafood from Vietnam Magazine (www.
seafoodfromvietnam.com.vn) and World of Pangasius (www.worldofpangasius.com.vn).

output in 2002 and 2003. In Dong Thap, An Giang, Vinh Long, and Can Tho, almost 100
percent of the aquaculture production is freshwater aquaculture. The share is much smaller
in coastal provinces, where brackish and marine fishing is more relevant (columns 2 and 5).
In particular, shrimp is prevalent in Bac Lieu, Ca Mau, and Kieng Giang, which are located
on the Southernmost tip of Vietnam (columns 3 and 6). This confirms that landlocked
provinces tend to be much more specialized in freshwater aquaculture than coastal provinces.
Further, column 7 displays information on the share of provincial catfish production in 2003,
calculated from data on total catfish production in the Mekong region. The main producers
of tra and basa in 2003 were An Giang, which accounted for 40.2 percent of total production,
Dong Thap (15.8 percent) and Can Tho (25.5 percent). While Vinh Long and Tien Giang
were also relatively important catfish producers, Soc Trang only contributed 3.1 percent of
the total in 2003. All other provinces produced very little (around 1.6 percent) of tra and

13

basa in that year. Overall, these data confirm that catfish is indeed mostly produced in
landlocked Mekong provinces.
In light of this evidence, our analysis focuses on the six ‘catfish provinces’ identified
above, which we aggregate into two samples (see the last two columns of Table 2). Our
core sample, which we call Mekong 4 (M4), comprises the landlocked provinces that almost
fully specialize in freshwater aquaculture, namely An Giang, Can Tho, Dong Thap and Vinh
Long. For robustness, we also explore results using an alternative sample, which we call
Mekong 6 (M6), that adds the provinces of Soc Trang and Tien Giang. These two latter
provinces are also engaged in catfish farming, but are significantly diversified into brackish
and marine aquaculture as well.

3.1

The Household Survey Data

For the empirical analysis, we use panel data from the Vietnam Household Living Standard
Surveys (VHLSS). The first round of the VHLSS was carried out in 2001-2002, before the
imposition of U.S. tariffs on catfish in 2003. The second round was carried out in August
2004, after the introduction of the trade barriers. The availability of ex-ante and ex-post
panel data makes the AD on Vietnamese catfish an ideal case study.
The VHLSSs were conducted by The General Statistics Office of Vietnam (GSO) with
technical assistance from UN Statistics Division, the World Bank and Statistics Sweden. In
both surveys, GSO used a stratified two-stage sampling design. The primary sampling units
were enumeration areas in urban areas, and supervisor areas in rural areas, identified in the
1999 Population and Housing Census. The surveys are representative at the national level.

14

VHLSS’02 surveyed more than 74,000 households while VHLSS’04 surveyed over 44,000. A
fraction of this sample forms a panel, with a total of 16,518 households surveyed in both years.
The size of the panel is smaller than the initially planned figure of 20,000, both because of
attrition and because errors in recording household identifiers makes it impossible to match
some panel households between the two rounds of the survey. Unfortunately, it is not possible
to establish which or how many of the remaining 3,482 households are lost from the panel
because of attrition or because of the mis-coding.9
The VHLSSs comprise several modules with information on demographics, education,
employment, health, income and labor supply. There is also an expenditure module, which
was however used only for a subsample of the interviewed households, 29,000 in VHLSS’02
and 9,000 in VHLSS’04. In practice, the expenditure module is not usable for our purposes
because there are only a few dozen observations in the panel sample of aquaculture households
in our focus Mekong provinces. Extensive modules record information on farm activities
related to agriculture, livestock and aquaculture. Data include production, sales, input use
and investment. The information on aquaculture activities distinguishes between raising
and catching fish, shrimp, or all other aquaculture products (like mollusks). It must be
emphasized that the data do not explicitly separate catfish from more general fish production.
Hence, although in the rest of the paper we will refer to ‘catfish income’ and to ‘catfish
households’, these are, strictly speaking, ‘fish income’ and ‘fish households’. At the same
time, we have shown that catfish production is largely concentrated in the regions relevant
9

Households who form the panel appear to be very similar to the overall sample in the 2002 survey, so
differential attrition/miscoding should not be a concern. For instance, the mean income share from fish
farming in M4 provinces is 11.2 both among panel households and in the complete 2002 sample. Similarly,
per capita income among these households is 3,537 Dong per year in panel households and 3,578 in the full
2002 sample.

15

for our analysis, in particular in M4 provinces.
Sample size and income levels on the panel sample are reported in Table 3. Panels
A) and B) refer to households in the Mekong Delta in the target samples M4 and M6;
Panel C includes information on South Vietnam (excluding the Mekong), for comparison
purposes.10 The table includes figures for fishing households, all rural households (fishing
and non-fishing), and all households in the panel data, for both 2002 and 2004. Catfish
production is concentrated in the Mekong region. There are 561 and 788 catfish households
in the M4 and M6 panel samples, respectively. This is over half of the overall sample in
the region and around 60 percent of the total rural sample. These catfish households are
the relevant population exposed to the AD shock on which we base our analysis. Fishing
is less prevalent in the rest of rural South Vietnam, where it involves only 384 out of 3185
households (12 percent).
For each of the M4, M6, and South Vietnam (non-Mekong) regions, and for each set of
households (fishing, rural, all), we also report in Table 3 the median level of total annual per
capita income (pci ) in thousand 2002 Vietnamese Dong and in US PPP dollars.11 Income is
defined as the sum of all sources of household income including earnings in agriculture (both
from sale and home consumption), aquaculture, wages, livestock, silviculture, hunting, nonfarm activities and transfers. The median income levels are very similar for catfish households
in the target samples M4 and M6 both in 2002 and 2004. In M4, median pci increases from
3,537 thousand Dong in 2002 to 4,224 thousand Dong in 2004, while in M6 it increases from
10

We exclude North Vietnam from the analysis because of the striking differences in performance between
the North and the South resulting from differences in the political environment up to the mid 1980s. We
thank Quy-Toan Do for raising this issue in previous versions of our paper. See also Brandt (2006).

The numbers reported in the table are in real terms and have been deflated by the general price index
used to measure inflation in Vietnam as well as PPP series from the World Development Indicators.

16

3,544 to 4,281 thousand Dong. Note that, despite the AD shock to catfish income, there is
sizeable growth in total per capita income in the Mekong. These growth rates are, however,
slightly lower than the average growth rate in pci at the national level based on VHLSS data.
Catfish households are relatively better-off than the rest of the households in the Mekong. For
instance, in 2002, the median pci of fishing households was around 4.8 percent higher than
among all rural households and 4.5 percent higher than the overall median in the Mekong.
Note that Mekong households are also better off than South Vietnamese households.
To present an overview of the sources of income in the region, we report in Table 4 the
share of income derived from different economic activities in the two target samples M4 and
M6. Catfish households rarely specialize in fishing and are instead diversified into various
economic activities, including wage labor, agriculture (both for sale in the market and for
home consumption) and miscellaneous farm activities (including poultry, livestock, odd-job
farm services, and silviculture). At the same time, these households were only marginally
involved in other aquaculture activities, such as shrimp or marine fishing. In Table 4, we
see that the share of catfish income declined in the Mekong area after the imposition of the
antidumping duties in 2003. Before the AD shock, the average share of income derived from
catfish in M4 was 11.2 percent. In 2004, we observe the share dropped by almost 40 percent,
to 6.8 percent. Similarly, the share of catfish income in M6 decreased by about one third,
from 9.6 percent in 2002 to 6.5 percent in 2004.

Anti-dumping Duties: Impacts on Household Income

In this section, we describe our empirical strategy and we discuss our estimates of the
impact of the AD duties on household income. In section 5, we provide a more detailed
documentation of household adjustments in the income generation process among fishing
farms in the Mekong delta.

4.1

Empirical Strategy

The target samples in our analysis include households residing in provinces of the Mekong
regions where catfish production is concentrated—the M4 and M6 samples defined above.
In addition, we use the sample of households in South Vietnam for falsification purposes as
well as for robustness. As already explained, we explicitly exclude provinces in Northern
Vietnam because of the historical differences with the South (Brandt, 2006).
In all our models, our estimation strategy relies on comparing household outcomes before
and after the introduction of the U.S. AD duties across households with different levels of
exposure to the shock. Let Yh,t be the outcome of interest in year t, t = 2002, 2004. In our
baseline model, we include all households (i.e., fishing and non-fishing rural farms) in the
target regions, M4 and M6, and we estimate the following regression for the outcome change
∆ ln Yh = ln Yh,2004 − ln Yh,2002 :

(1)

∆ ln Yh = φ + φ0 1(sch = 0) + ∆x0h β + γ ln yh,2002 + g(sch ) + h ,

18

where xht is a vector of household controls, ln yh,2002 is the log of the initial level of household
income and sch is the initial share of income derived from catfish farming. In (1), φ is the
common time trend for fish farmers and the coefficient φ0 allows explicitly for the presence
of a different trend for households with no involvement in aquaculture (measured by φ +
φ0 ). It is important to allow for such difference in trends because catfish farming requires
the availability of distinctive land characteristics which may be associated with unobserved
differences in income trends (Brandt, 2006).12 The function g(·) allows for non-linearities in
the impact of exposure to the shock on outcome changes. We discuss below estimates from
a quadratic functional form as well as semi-parametric estimates where the function g(.) is
left unspecified.
The availability of panel data allows for the presence of year fixed effects (φ) and household fixed effects, where the latter have been differenced out in (1). The inclusion of a year
effect controls for overall trends and aggregate shocks which may have affected all households
equally. The household fixed effects absorb time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity at the
farm/household level such as preferences, farming ability, land quality, or other pre-shock
differences in aquaculture production. In addition, the household fixed effects embed regional, district or otherwise local effects. The vector xht includes a list of household-specific
controls, that is, household size, demographic composition, marital status and education of
the head. The inclusion of ln yh,2002 among the regressors allows us to control for differences
in trends that are a function of initial (log) income (Banerjee et al., 2007).
Exposure to the AD shock is measured by sch , that is, the share of total household income
12
We also estimate models using only fishing farms (with sch > 0). Further, in section 4.3 below, we
estimate a more general model that allows for different trends at different exposure levels.

19

in 2002 derived from fish farming. In Section 3, we have argued that such variable is a good
approximation for the share of income from catfish farming, especially in M4 regions.13 Note
that our estimates are a measure of the differential impact of the shock at different levels of
exposure. It follows that an estimated negative impact of sch on the change in ln Yh does not
literally indicate a predicted decline in the outcome, but rather measures the impact on the
rate of growth relative to a household whose share of income from catfish farming is positive
but close to zero.14 In the remaining of the paper we will refer to such differential changes
as to “relative income losses.”
Figure 3 plots an estimate of the distribution of initial catfish shares (conditional on
catfish participation), using Gaussian Kernel methods, for sample M4. The distribution of
catfish shares is clearly unimodal and right-skewed. The mode is close to 0.025, while mean
and median are respectively 5.5 and 11.2 percent. To reveal different AD effects at different
levels of exposure, below we evaluate the estimated impact of the AD at different values of
sh . Using data from M4, we define three levels of exposure: low, at the median share (5.5
percent); medium, at the mean share of 11.2 percent; high, at a level equal to the median
share among farmers above the sample mean (around 20 percent). These exposure levels are

We have already shown that fish income shares are good proxies for catfish income shares in M6 and
especially M4 provinces, and below we develop several validation exercises to further support this claim.
ish
Nevertheless, the fact that we use sfhish as a proxy for scatf
has implications for the interpretation of
h
our results. In all our regressions, we estimate the predicted change in the growth on an outcome (income,
investment, etc.) associated with differences in exposure, measured by sfhish , with models such as ∆ ln Yh =
ish
φ+g(sfhish )+uh (abstracting for all other regressors). Since sfhish is a proxy, we have that sfhish = fh (scatf
).
h
0
As long as fh (.) > 0, an assumption that we argue is correct in M4 and M6 provinces, our results can be
interpreted as indicating the impact on the growth rate of Yh of an increase in the share of income from
catfish. However, note that the exact quantification of the slope would require knowledge of the shape of
the function f (.).
14
If exposure to the shock were binary, the results in this specification could be intuitively interpreted as
difference-in-differences (DD), with identification relying on the comparison of changes in outcomes between
households with high versus low exposure.

4.2

The Impact on Household Income

We begin by estimating the impact of the AD shock on household income.15 We present
separate results for total and per capita household income (which includes all sources of
income) and for net income (total income net of the cost of inputs in farm activities). Our
basic specification adopts a quadratic polynomial on the initial shares to estimate g(·). For
robustness, we also estimate a more general and flexible partially linear semi-parametric
model as in Robinson (1988).
15

As a reminder, expenditure-based indicators cannot be used as outcomes because the expenditure modules were filled only by a small sample in our panel of aquaculture households in the Mekong.

21

Results from the quadratic regression model are in Panel A of Table 5. We report the
impact on total household income in M4 (column 1) and in M6 (column 2). The corresponding results for per capita household income are in columns 3 and 4 and, for net income, in
columns 5 and 6. All our estimates for the three outcomes are negative and statistically
significant at the 1 percent level. Looking at M4, we find that a farmer with the median
pre-shock share suffers a relative income loss of 8.7 percent (column 1 of Panel A). A farmer
with an average pre-shock share suffers instead a relative income loss of 15.8 percent, while
the relative loss for a high-exposure farmer is 23.6 percent. The impact on per capita income
is similar, 8.9, 16.2 and 24.1 percent, respectively (column 3). Instead, the impact on net
income is slightly larger: 10.5 percent for low-exposure, 18.8 percent for average-exposure,
and 27.6 percent for high-exposure (column 5).
When we estimate model (1) using the expanded M6 sample, the impact on each outcome
is lower in magnitude but still negative and statistically significant at the 1 percent level. In
column 2 of Panel A, the relative decline in total household income is 7.1 percent for lowexposure farmers, 12.9 percent for the average farmer, and 19.2 percent for highly-exposed
farmers. The relative losses in per capita income are equal to 7.3, 13.2 and 19.6 percent, for
low-, average-, and high-exposure households, respectively (column 4). Finally, the relative
declines in net income are estimated at 8.9, 16.0, and 23.6 percent for the three exposure
levels (column 6). The fact that the magnitude of the estimates is lower when the sample is
expanded to include households in M6 relative to M4 was to be expected. In fact, as shown
in Table 2, fish farming was almost completely represented by freshwater aquaculture (such
as catfish) in M4, while it represented a significantly lower share in Tien Giang and Soc

22

Trang, the two added provinces in M6. In other words, sc is a better proxy for exposure to
the AD shock in M4 than in M6 provinces and so we would expect the estimated impacts to
be attenuated in this second sample.
As an alternative specification, we estimate a model analogous to equation (1) but where
we include only households involved in aquaculture, that is, households with sch > 0. Results
from this model are similar to those discussed above, for all levels of exposure, for all three
outcomes and for both M4 and M6.16 As an example, consider the impact on total household
income in M4. The relative income losses are 6.2 percent for low-exposure farmers (vis-à-vis
8.7 percent), 11.3 percent for mean-exposure farmers (vs. 15.8 percent), and 17 percent for
high-exposure producers (vs. 23.6 percent).
In Panel B of Table 5, we estimate the exposure function g(·) non-parametrically.17 In
general, our findings are similar to those from the quadratic model. For instance, in M4 the
impact on total household income change is 9.4, 16.9, and 24.3 percent, at low-, mean- and
high-exposure respectively. In M6, the corresponding figures are 7.1, 13.5, and 20.5 percent.
The estimated impact on the rate of growth of per capita and net income is also similar to
the quadratic specification.18
We can use our semi-parametric estimates to plot the overall shape of the function g(·),
which reveals the different impact for households across different catfish shares. The results

the authors personal Web sites.
17
We estimate the partially linear model of Robinson (1988) with locally weighted non-parametric regressions. Since in this model the scale of the function g(·) cannot be recovered, we adopt the normalization
lims→0 g(sc ) = 0, as in the quadratic specification. The standard errors are computed using the theoretical
formulas reported in Pagan an Ullah (1999).
18
The results for the model based only on aquaculture households (reported in Panel B of Table A1 in the
Supplemental Web Appendix) are comparable as well.

are in Figure 4. Panel A shows estimates for total income, Panel B for per capita income,
and Panel C for net income. For each outcome, the graph on the left is the estimate for
the M4 sample while the one on the right refers to the M6 sample. Consistent with the
parametric estimates, the shape of the function g is non-linear, with a negative sloped and
convex. Given that the quadratic model approximates well the shape of the function g(.),
in the remaining of the paper we only focus on the parametric estimates.

4.3

A Validation Exercise

Our identification strategy relies on the fact that exposure to the AD shock is well approximated by the share of income from fish farming (which, in turn, is a close approximation to
the share from catfish farming in M6 and especially M4 provinces). Central to this hypothesis
is that, conditional on household fixed effects and the other controls included in the model,
households with different involvement in fish farming would not have been characterized by
a systematically different time trend, were it not for the presence of the AD tariff. If that
were instead the case, the impact of the AD tariffs would be confounded by such differences
in unobserved trends.19 To probe further this identification strategy, we perform a validation exercise where we also include in models (1) and (??) observations from non-Mekong
provinces in South Vietnam (arguably the best candidates for this exercise). This strategy
provides a test of our hypothesis that the results are not driven by unobserved differences
in trends at different fish income shares sc . In fact, we find that the predicted changes in
19

One potential threat to our assumption is the outbreak of the avian flu in 2004. Note, however, that
while the initial outbreak took place in January 2004, the epidemic only became sizeable after August 2004
and thus after the collection of data for the 2004 round of the VHLSS. The outbreak of the avian flu is then
unlikely to be an important concern.

The estimates represent the relationship between the growth rate in total household income (panel A),

to the U.S. antidumping shock (measured by the share of income derived from catfish) relative to a
household with marginal exposure. The graphs on the left are estimated using the M4 sample (which
includes the Mekong provinces of An Giang, Can Tho, Dong Thap and Vinh Long); the graphs on the

25

outcomes for households in non-Mekong South Vietnam are positive (and mostly small and
not significant). Nevertheless, the inclusion of non-Mekong South Vietnamese fish farmers in
the estimation allows us to control for any South Vietnam aquaculture-specific trends (even
if they are relatively small).20
Concretely, the modified model becomes:

(2) ∆ ln Yh = φ + φ0 1(sh = 0) + ∆x0h β + γ ln yh,2002 + α0 Mh + α1 sh × Mh + α2 sh 2 × Mh
+ γ1 sh + γ2 sh 2 + φ2 1(sh = 0) × Mh + h ,

where Mh is a dummy which takes a value of one for target households (those residing in
M4 or M6) and sh is the share of income from fish farming. Note that the model includes
both a binary variable equal to one for households with sh = 0 as well as its interaction
with Mh , so that non-aquaculture households are allowed to have region-specific trends.
Under our identifying assumptions, the impact of the AD at a given exposure s for Mekong
catfish producers is then α1 s + α2 s2 . We expect estimates of these effects to be negative and
comparable to those reported in Table 5. The change for South Vietnam fishing households
is instead γ1 s + γ2 s2 .
The results are displayed in Table 6. Estimates of model (2) for Mekong farms are shown
in Panel A, and for Southern (non-Mekong) farms, in Panel B. Two observations emerge
from these results. First, the estimated impact on Mekong catfish farmers is comparable,
although larger in magnitude, to our findings reported in Table 5, for all three income
20

Intuitively, if exposure were a binary variable, this approach would be equivalent to a triple difference
estimator, where identification derives from the comparison of two DD estimates between two groups (in our
case, Mekong vs. rest of South Vietnam.

26

outcomes. For example, in M4 (Panel A), column (1), the relative income losses are 12.8
percent, 22.9 percent, and 33.8 percent for low-, mean-, and high-exposure, respectively.21
Second, the results for non-Mekong Southern farms show that, for all outcomes and for
all levels of exposure, there is no evidence that the pre-AD fishing shares are negatively
associated with income growth. Indeed all estimated impacts for these farms are actually
positive and in some cases large and statistically significant. The fact that such estimated
impacts are positive is in fact the reason why the estimates for Mekong households become
larger in magnitude than the corresponding figures in Table 5. Overall, this falsification
experiment helps validate our empirical strategy: while a relatively large involvement in fish
farming was associated with a relatively higher rate of income growth in the non-Mekong
South (although in most cases not statistically significant), the opposite was true in M4 and
M6 provinces, where involvement in freshwater aquaculture is a proxy for catfish farming.
Similar results are obtained from variations of this validation exercise where the comparison
sample comprises either Mekong households (not in M6) or both non-Mekong South farms
and non-M6 Mekong farms.
Before turning to study in detail how catfish farmers adjusted to the AD shock, we should
mention that our estimates reflect the impact of the anti-dumping after allowing for different
economy-wide responses to the shock. One important such response is trade deflection, that
is, the shift of exports to other non-U.S. markets (Bown and Crowley, 2007). For Vietnamese
catfish, trade deflection is hard to establish or to rule out, due to lack of data.22 Some
21

The estimated relative losses from a model using only aquaculture households, reported in Table A2 of
the Supplemental Web Appendix, are also comparable.
22
The Vietnamese government does not release export data on catfish, while publicly available data on
COMTRADE is disaggregated up to the level of frozen fillets, but not specifically catfish.

27

evidence is offered by COMEXT data on European Union imports, which indicate that
imported quantities of tra and basa from Vietnam increased by 78 percent between 2002
and the first semester of 2004.23 Another factor which may have muted the negative impact
of the U.S. tariffs is government policy. In July 2003, the Vietnamese ministry launched
the Fund for Development of Aquaproduct Export Markets to support aquaculture product
exporters of fish. Further, Agifish and other fish exporters launched a campaign to promote
domestic consumption of basa and tra fish. While these initiatives could have helped catfish
producers directly, they may have also created spillovers on non-catfish household activities.

Household Adjustments to the Anti-Dumping Measures

In the previous section, we reported reduced-form estimates of the impact of the AD shock on
household income. These are, ultimately, the relevant quantities needed to assess the welfare
impact of the trade shock on Vietnamese Mekong households. These impacts, however, do
not directly describe the mechanisms through which households were affected, mechanisms
that we set out to uncover in this section. This exercise should provide useful insights about
the way households cope with large trade shocks, thus allowing us to enrich the still small
literature that analyzes the impact of international trade at the micro level in developing
countries.
A drop in catfish prices has a direct, first order welfare impact via changes in catfish
23

According to data released by the Vietnamese government, the European Union accounted for 29.6
percent of Vietnamese catfish exports in 2004.

28

income.24 These first order effects can be measured with data on catfish income shares,
by using a procedure that has become routine in the literature after the pioneering work of
Deaton (1989)—especially when only cross-sectional data are available. Households can react
to a large change in the relative price of an important agricultural output such as catfish by
reallocating resources away from catfish farming and into agriculture, or may reduce farm
labor in favor of off-farm labor.
In Deaton’s approach, the welfare impact of these adjustments is assumed to be negligible.
This is because if the first order conditions in production hold for each household, even though
all sources of income may change, the marginal return of inputs should be identical across
different activities. Hence, in the margin, these effects net out in the welfare calculations.
However, the standard first order approximation can be inaccurate if there are missing
markets or other distortions, or if the price change is large enough that general equilibrium
effects and second-order effects become important. For instance, general equilibrium effects
may arise if changes in catfish prices cause changes in the local derived factor demands in
the region. In the Mekong, catfish sales are a major source of cash income and lower catfish
prices are thus associated with lower demand for products and services produced locally.
This, in turn, may reduce the income earned in non-catfish activities, such as agriculture,
off-farm work or poultry and livestock raising. In consequence, a catfish producer will be
affected directly by lower catfish prices and revenues and also indirectly by these spillovers
to local markets. On the other hand, local substitution in consumption away from poultry
24

Note that while it is not obvious that the imposition of U.S. AD duties on Vietnamese catfish should
bring about a decline in prices (in particular if Vietnam was originally involved in dumping), there is ample
evidence of such price decline. A comprehensive U.K. Department for International Development report, for
instance, shows that in An Giang basa and tra prices declined by 25-26 percent during 2003. See Nguyen,
Nguyen, and M. Philips (2004).

29

and into now cheaper catfish could dampen the direct impact of the AD.
In addition, second-order effects may become important if complete markets do not exist,
a condition which will generate wedges between shadow and market prices that can affect the
first order calculations. More specifically, our study areas in Vietnam are characterized by
two major market imperfections. First, there is ample evidence of limits to off-farm employment opportunities which generate a discrepancy between the exogenous market wage and
the endogenous shadow family wage (Nguyen, Nguyen and Phillips, 2004; Seshan, 2006; Le,
2008). Le (2008, 2009) builds on Jacoby (1993) and estimates six-fold differences between
shadow and market wages, a finding that is consistent with large limitations to off-farm employment.25 In addition, Do and Iyer (2008) provide strong evidence of credit constraints.
Credit market imperfections can create a cash-in-advance constraint where the cash income
earned from catfish sales is needed to finance household investments, not only in aquaculture
but also in agriculture. In this scenario, changes in catfish prices may affect input choices
and then restrict the production possibilities in current and future seasons. Note that these
imperfections can be interdependent. For instance, the liquidity constraint that forces households to rely on available cash income to purchase inputs can be amplified by the lack of
cash-earning opportunities from labor outside the farm.
We can better illustrate these mechanisms as follows.

Assume, for simplicity, that

households are engaged in two economic activities, catfish and agriculture. Total income
is yh = yhc + yha , the sum of catfish income yhc and agricultural income yha . In turn, these are
equal to the product of prices p and quantities q so that yh = pch qhc + pah qha . The change in
25
Benjamin (1992) describes how the lack of complete labor markets leads to non-separability in consumption and production decision for agricultural households.

30

household income that would take place after a drop in pc is

(3)

dyh = qhc dpch + pch dqhc + pah dqha + qha dpah .

The first term on the right-hand side is the first order approximation in Deaton (1989).
The second and third term comprise household production adjustments in aquaculture and
agriculture. With lower catfish prices, farmers produce less catfish and more agricultural
products (so that dqhc < 0 and dqha > 0). Typically, these two terms cancel out if marginal
products are identical across activities, but can be non-zero with distortions. The last term
illustrate a market general equilibrium effect that would occur if the price of the agricultural
good changes in response to the catfish anti-dumping. This arises if, for instance, lower catfish
income or local substitution effects in consumption lowers the local demand for agricultural
products. In the remaining of this section, we study the reaction to the AD shock of different
components of income.
We begin by assessing the response of income from catfish farming to the AD shock:
we estimate model (1) using the change in (log) fishing income as the dependent variable.
Results are in columns 1 and 2 of Table 7 (Panel A).26 As expected, the anti-dumping had
a large impact on fish income at all levels of exposure and especially for highly-exposed
farmers. For instance, in the M4 sample, the relative catfish income loss is 36.7 percent for
low-exposure farmers, 57.7 percent for the average farmer, and 74.0 percent for the highexposed farmer (the impacts in M6 are 39.8, 61.6 and 77.6 percent respectively). In Panel
26

Note that, with this outcome, we cannot include households not involved in fish farming in 2002, because
for them the dependent variable is missing.

31

B, we report the estimated impacts for Mekong fish farmers when we perform the same
validation exercise as in Table 6, by including aquaculture households from non-Mekong
Southern provinces as well. All estimates remain large, negative and significant at the 1
percent level, although their magnitude decreases by about one quarter. This is because the
inclusion of Southern provinces allows us to control for fish-specific trends and to separate
the actual impact of the AD shock from any mechanical negative correlation between growth
in fishing income and initial fishing income shares.
We can use the estimated changes in catfish income to predict the magnitude of the
implied first order change in total household income that we should have observed if all
other sources of income had remained unchanged. Keeping agricultural income and prices
constant, we have that d ln yh = sch d ln yhc . By multiplying the estimated changes in catfish
income in columns 1 and 2 of Table 7 by the pre-shock catfish shares, we estimate relative
losses in total income yh of 2.0, 6.5 and 14.8 percent for low-, average- and high-exposure
farmers. These magnitudes are smaller than the estimated relative losses in total income
reported above. For instance, in Table 5, our estimates were equal to 8.7, 15.8, and 23.6
percent for the three levels of exposure in M4. These differences are likely accounted for by
changes in non-catfish sources of income that are induced by spillovers from the AD shock.
To explore this hypothesis, we examine the indirect impact of the AD shock on incomegenerating activities other than catfish income. Major sources of household income are
wage income, agricultural sales, agricultural own-production, and miscellaneous farm activities (poultry, farm services and livestock). Results are in columns 3-10 of Table 7, where
estimates in Panel A corresponds to regressions using all observations (aquaculture and non-

32

aquaculture) in the Mekong.27 We find little or no evidence that the anti-dumping shock
caused changes in household income earned from wage labor (columns 3 and 4), from the
sales of agricultural product (columns 5 and 6) or from the value of production for home
consumption (columns 7 and 8). Most estimated impacts, at all level of exposure, are statistically insignificant, although in some cases the point estimates are relatively large.
There is evidence of a decline in income from miscellaneous farm activities such as poultry,
livestock, and farm services (columns 9 and 10). For instance, in column 9 of Panel A (M4, all
farmers), the relative decline in income from these activities is 22.5 percent for low-exposure
farmers, 37.9 percent for mean-exposure farmers, and 51.8 percent for high-exposure farmers.
Similar impacts are estimated using catfish farms only (Supplemental Web Appendix). The
local demand for these products and services could have been affected not only by lower cash
income from catfish sales but also by a substitution in consumption away from poultry and
into cheaper catfish.28
To further investigate the mechanisms that led to these responses in different income
sources, we study changes in hours worked and in investment. Results are in Table 8; in
Panel A, we use all Mekong households, while in Panel B we also include all households
from non-Mekong Southern provinces. We begin by inspecting the impact on hours worked
off-farm for wage, in columns 1 and 2. The results, which are consistent with the lack of
27

We obtained comparable results from a model using only aquaculture observations. See Table A3 of the
Supplemental Web Appendix.
28
It should be noted that there are differences in the samples used in different regressions within this
section. This is because not all households in the core sample (i.e., the pre-shock aquaculture producers in
2002) report positive amounts for all the dependent variables analyzed in this section. An obvious example
is fish income, which is not reported by pre-shock producers who abandoned the market before 2004. The
differences in sample size raise concerns that our inferences from Tables 5 to 7 could be based on potentially
non-comparable samples. In Appendix 2, we carry out a series of robustness checks and we argue that the
results are not driven by different samples used in the regressions.

33

adjustment in wages documented above, reveal that hours worked off-farm were not affected
by the AD shock. This suggests that wage income did not respond mostly because households
did not, or perhaps could not, increase labor supply to the local labor market. The result
is consistent with the evidence of limited opportunities for off-farm employment in Vietnam
documented by Nguyen, Nguyen and Phillips (2004), Seshan (2006), and Le (2008, 2009).
Also, since neither off-farm wage income nor hours worked off-farm were affected by the AD
shock, we can conclude that hourly wages did not respond either so that spillovers via local
labor markets in non-catfish activities do not appear to have played an important role.29
In Columns 3 to 10 of Table 8, we examine rates of growth of different forms of investment, defined here as expenditures in productive activities. The Vietnam Household Living
Standard Surveys compiles detailed information on investment expenditures in agriculture,
aquaculture, silviculture, livestock, farm services and other activities. In the target samples
(M4 and M6), over half of these expenditures on productive inputs is allocated to agriculture.
Aquaculture absorbs around 20 percent, livestock, farm services and silviculture, 19 percent,
and other activities around 10 percent. In columns 3 and 4, we report sizeable relative
declines in catfish investment. In M4, the relative decline in catfish input expenditures in
low-exposure households is 28.3 percent, while the figure is 46.4 percent for medium-exposure
households and 61.9 percent when exposure is high (all estimates are statistically significant
at the 1 percent level). Similar results are estimated in the M6 target sample, or when
households from the non-Mekong South are included (columns 3 and 4 in Panel B). These
findings are consistent with cuts in aquaculture activities following the AD shock. Moreover,
29

In results not reported, we tested this by computing a measure of hourly wages (total wage earning
divided by total hours) and found very small and statistically insignificant effects at all levels of exposure.

34

the results suggest large supply (quantity) responses to the shock.
There is little evidence, instead, that households adjusted total investment following the
catfish shock. Our point estimates in columns 5 and 6 are always negative, but they are
small and we cannot reject the hypothesis that they are equal to zero. When we perform the
usual validation by including households from the non-Mekong South (Panel B) the point
estimates become positive, but they are again small and very imprecisely estimated, so that
even in this case the null of no change for catfish farmers in Mekong cannot be rejected at
standard levels. In contrast, there is evidence that households relatively more involved in
catfish farming saw faster rates of growth in input expenditures in agriculture. In columns
7 and 8 of Table 8, in panels A and B, the relative growth in expenditures in agricultural
inputs is positive, large, and increasing with exposure. Finally, we find that the growth in
input expenditures in miscellaneous farm activities (livestock, poultry, farm services) was
lower for households more exposed to the AD shock. The estimates in columns 9 and 10 are
negative and large, but they are not precisely estimated and we cannot reject the null of no
relative decline in this type of investment across levels of exposure.30
This analysis of the impacts on income sources and investment provides useful insights
on household adjustments, especially in terms of agricultural production, a major activity
in the Mekong. We uncover two opposing forces at play. On the one hand, there was little
overall response in agricultural earnings, both for sale and for home consumption, following
the catfish AD shock. However, the pattern of changes in investments shows clear evidence
of substitution towards agricultural inputs after the shock. We speculate that these two re30

sponses are the result of potential negative market spillovers (whereby lower catfish income
led to declines in agricultural activity in the region) matched by a substitution of household production away from catfish and into agriculture. Ultimately, the catfish shock forced
Mekong farmers to shut off catfish production and expand agriculture to maintain the value
of agricultural production in the presence of negative local market spillovers. Several pieces
of supplementary evidence support these conclusions. First, as in many developing countries,
production of agricultural products, especially for home consumption, provides a safety net
to protect against income shocks. In this setting, an expansion of agriculture, especially
rice production in the Mekong, is not surprising. Second, negative local spillovers have been
documented in various reports. Nguyen, Nguyen, and Philips (2004), for instance, provide
several accounts based on interviews in An Giang province (the main catfish province in the
Mekong) of large losses in catfish and non-catfish activities alike. Likewise, Tu and Nguyen
(2004) describe inter-sectoral linkages in the Mekong delta. Third, the 2004 VHLSS questionnaire included questions on major hazards constraining household production that we
can use to check the role of prices. About 56 percent of Mekong farmers reported low prices
(in general) as one of the “three most frequent difficulties faced in production/business.”
While we cannot be sure from these questions that low prices are due to the AD shock,
these data are at least consistent with the existence of negative general equilibrium effects
on prices throughout the local economy.

Conclusions

Following an anti-dumping lawsuit, the United States imposed tariffs on imports of catfish
from Vietnam in June of 2003. These tariffs, which ranged from 37 to 64 percent, led to
sharp declines in Vietnamese exports of catfish to the U.S. market. At that time, the United
States was the main destination market for Vietnamese catfish, a product which constitutes
an important source of income for thousands of households in the Mekong delta of South
Vietnam. These facts, together with the availability of a panel data of Vietnamese households
for 2002 and 2004, allow us to provide a rich ex-post analysis of the impact of antidumping
policies on household behavior.
We have studied impacts on household income and found that, over the 2002-2004 period, the rate of growth of income was significantly lower among households relatively more
involved in catfish farming. In addition, we have explored how catfish households adjusted
to a large trade shock in a scenario of limited off-farm labor opportunities. We find that the
slower rate of income growth among fish farmers in areas where catfish production was concentrated was explained not only by a sharp relative reduction in income from fish farming
but also by a reduction in the growth of income from miscellaneous farm activities. This
observation is consistent with the existence of spillovers of the AD measures on economic
activities different from those (catfish) directly impacted by it. Finally, although we do not
find evidence that the growth in total investment was slower among catfish farmers, there
is clear evidence that households moved away from fish farming and re-allocated investment
towards agriculture. Overall, our results provide an uncommonly detailed account of the
complex micro-economic impact of trade policies on the livelihood of households involved in
37

the primary sector of a developing country.
Appendix 1: Robustness to Different Samples
In most of the regressions reported in section 5, sample size change. This is because not all
households in the sample report positive numbers for all the variables analyzed. An obvious example
is fish income, which is not reported by pre-shock producers that dropped out of the market by
2004. These differences in sample size raise concerns that our inferences from Tables 7 and 8 are
based on potentially non-comparable samples. To shed some light on this issue, we re-estimated
the model for changes in income (total, per capita, and net) for the various (selected) sample sizes
in Tables 7 and 8 and we compared the results with those for the core samples (from Tables 5 to
6). If these results are similar across samples, then we can claim that our inferences based on the
selected samples are unlikely to be driven by the differences among the samples. After performing
this exercise, we find in general that the impacts on income are indeed similar for all alternative
samples. As an example, we report the results for total income, net of input purchases, in Table
A1, for samples varying by sources of income, labor supply, and various input purchases. We find
that the impact on income are very similar across samples.

Misc. Farm Income

Note: Estimates of income sources: catfish income, wage income, agricultural sales, agricultural own-consumption, and miscellaneous farm
income (poultry, livestock, informal odd-job). The estimates show impacts on Mekong farms estimated with a quadratic polynomial in initial
catfish shares. Panel A) is based on model (1) using all Mekong observations, except for the ‘catfish income’ variable (which uses only fishing
farms). Panel B) is based on model (2) using all Mekong and South observations, except for the ‘catfish income’ variable (which uses only fishing
farms). See Only Appendix for results using only fishing farms. Mekong 4 (M4) and Mekong 6 (M6) refer to two sets of Mekong provinces that
specialize in catfish production: M4 includes An Giang, Can Tho, Dong Thap and Vinh Long, and M6 adds Soc Trang and Tien Giang.
Robust standard errors within parenthesis: ∗, ∗∗ and ∗ ∗ ∗ indicate significance at 10%, 5%, and 1% level, respectively.
