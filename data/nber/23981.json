    "abstract": "\n\nUsing novel contract-level data, we study the recent trend in open-end mutual funds investing in unicorns\u2014highly valued, privately held start-ups\u2014and the consequences of these investments for corporate governance provisions. Larger funds and those with more stable funding are more likely to invest in unicorns. Compared to venture capital groups (VCs), mutual funds have weaker cash flow rights and are less involved in terms of corporate governance, being particularly underrepresented on boards of directors. Having to carefully manage their own liquidity pushes mutual funds to require stronger redemption rights, suggesting contractual choices consistent with mutual funds\u2019 short-term capital sources.\n\n",
