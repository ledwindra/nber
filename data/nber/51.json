    "abstract": "\n\nDuring the past decade, much has been said about the role that on-the-job training plays in augmenting one's stock of human capital.  Up to this point, little has been done to distinguish the effect of on-the-job training from that of aging on the increase in human wealth.  The reason rests primarily on the fact that it is difficult to observe  or even define in some appropriate way the amount of on-the-job training that an individual possesses. In this paper, a method is developed by which one may compare the effects of work experience to those of aging per se. The difference is then attributed to on-the-job training.\n\n",
