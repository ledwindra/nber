Long Horizon Uncovered Interest Parity Re-Assessed

NBER Working Paper No. 18482
October 2012
JEL No. F3
ABSTRACT
We review the evidence for both short and long horizon uncovered interest parity (UIP) and rational
expectations over the period up to 2011, extending the sample examined in Chinn and Meredith (2004)
by nearly a decade. We find that the joint hypothesis of UIP and rational expectations (known as the
unbiasedness hypothesis) holds better at long horizons than at short, although the effect is somewhat
weaker than documented in Chinn and Meredith (2004). Using the formula for the slope coefficient,
we identify potential sources for the difference in slope coefficients at different horizons. We attribute
our weaker findings for long horizon unbiasedness for certain currencies partly to the advent of extraordinarily
low interest rates associated with the zero interest bound in Japan and Switzerland.

1. Introduction
The failure of the joint hypothesis of uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) and rational
expectations is one of the most robust empirical regularities – and puzzles – in international finance.
According to the unbiasedness hypothesis, the interest rate differential between two countries should
be an unbiased predictor of the change in the exchange rate between them. As Chinn and Meredith
(2004) document, in a sample extending up to 2000, this hypothesis holds at longer horizons of five and
ten years, while failing to hold at shorter horizons extending up to a year.
This paper revisits the question of whether unbiasedness holds at long horizons, extending the
Chinn and Meredith (2004) dataset to 2011. Prior to Chinn and Meredith (2004), most papers focused
on the UIP hypothesis over short horizons of less than one year. This reflected the difficulty in obtaining
constant maturity longer term yields and the relatively short sample (relative to bond maturities)
available during the floating rate period.1 We now have a longer sample with which to conduct our
analyses, and therein lies the hope of estimating the relevant parameters more precisely.
However, data issues are not the only, or even primary reasons for this revisit. We believe a reexamination is important for at least four additional reasons. First, the last decade includes a period in
which short rates have effectively hit the zero interest rate bound. While long term rates remain above
zero, they remain quite low by historical standards, particularly for Japan and Switzerland. Second, the
2000’s were an era marked by unprecedented purchases of government bonds by the official sector
(specifically, East Asian and oil-exporter central banks). It is unclear to us that UIP should hold under
such circumstances. Third, there is evidence that some factors that have typically been ignored, such as

1

Fixed or constant maturity yields for specified horizon are synthetic yields derived from yields of bonds with
maturity shorter and longer than the specified horizon. Say we are interested in getting yield of a bond than
expires in exactly ten years from today. It is unlikely that there is a government bond out there in the market
which expires exactly 10 years from today. However there are bonds in the marker that expire in more than 10
years and less than ten years. The constant maturity 10 year yield data is calculated from the yields of these bonds.

default risk, have become increasingly important since the financial crisis of 2008; since covered interest
parity is a prerequisite for uncovered interest parity to hold, there is reason to believe that the behavior
of deviations from parity has changed. Finally, it is of interest to see if our previous conclusions
regarding this hypothesis have been colored by the behavior of Deutschemark. To the extent that the
DM and other legacy currencies no longer exist, the characterization of currency behavior should be
adapted to reflect these new realities.
To anticipate our results, we obtain the following findings. First, we find that UIP still holds
better at long horizons than at short, although the effect is somewhat weaker than documented in
Chinn and Meredith (2004). Second, the results are sensitive to the bond yields used. Third, the failure
of the unbiasedness hypothesis is more pronounced at long horizons when using the pound, instead of
the dollar, as the base currency. Finally, for the currencies characterized by particularly low bond yields
– the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc, interest rates in the mid-1990’s onward do not point in the right
direction for subsequent exchange rate changes. In other words, the advent of extraordinarily low
interest rates associated with the advent of the zero interest bound in Japan and Switzerland seems to
have attenuated the long horizon unbiasedness effect.
In the next section we briefly explore the literature. In Section 3 we review the unbiasedness
hypothesis and the underlying assumptions behind it. In Section 4, we look at the empirical evidence at
short and long horizons respectively. In Section 5 we explore theoretical reasons behind our main
empirical finding. Section 6 includes some robustness tests. In Section 7 we conclude.
2. Theory and Literature
UIP is a parity relationship built up on a number of assumptions. It is convenient to start with the
covered interest parity (CIP) relationship. CIP states that with efficient financial market with no default
risk and no barriers to capital flows, the no arbitrage condition is that the k period ahead forward
2

exchange rate at time t,

) can be expressed as a function of nominal rate of returns on risk free

bonds that matures in period k and the spot exchange rate as follows:

(1)

where

is the spot exchange rate at time t expressed as home currency units per unit of foreign

currency.

is the gross return (one plus the yield) on a default risk free bond denominated in the

home currency that matures in period k, and

is the corresponding gross return denominated in

foreign currency. The above relationship has been found to generally hold empirically.2 Taking logs, the
above expression can be approximated as:
(2)
where the lower scripts signifies logs of the variables described above.
The forward exchange rate is merely the price of foreign exchange set for a trade k periods ahead,
determined in the market at time t, that makes the returns equal when expressed in a common
currency.
How market participants determine the forward rate is not explained in this parity condition.
Under certain conditions, most importantly risk neutrality, the forward rate can be interpreted as the
expected future spot exchange rate.3 If investors are risk averse, the forward rate will differ from the
expected future spot exchange rate by amount of the risk premium, which we can define as follows:
(3)

2

See Dooley and Isard (1980) for discussion, and Popper (1993) for a review of the literature, and long horizon
findings.
3
See Engel (1996) for a discussion of how the forward rate and the expected spot rate might deviate even under
rational expectations and risk neutrality.

3

Where

is the exchange risk premium, and

is the subjective expectation of the future spot

rate based on time t information. Substituting equations (3) into equation (2), one obtains the following
expression:
(4)
Equation (4) relates ex ante depreciation to the interest differential (the term in the parentheses) and
the exchange risk premium.
The UIP hypothesis states, if investors are risk neutral, the return from investing a unit amount
in a risk free bond in the home currency for period k,

, should equal the expected return from

converting the unit amount into foreign currency and investing in risk free bond in foreign currency for
period k, and converting the foreign currency return back into home currency after period k. In equation
(5) this implies that the

term is zero.

Of course this hypothesis is difficult to test since one doesn’t directly observe the market’s
subjective expectations. Hence, researchers typically adopt the rational expectations hypothesis, so that
the subjective market expectation equals the mathematical (conditional) expectation. Under the
rational expectations hypothesis, the actual value of the future spot rate equals the expected value of
future spot rate plus an error term,
,
where

(5)

is an expectation error which is orthogonal to everything that is known at time t. This yields:
(6)

The resulting unbiasedness hypothesis is usually tested using the following specification, often referred
to as the “Fama regression” (Fama, 1984):
4

(7)
where the expected value of

according to the hypothesis is 1. The maintained hypothesis is the null

hypothesis, and under the unbiasedness null, the error
orthogonal to the interest rate differential,

is merely the expectations error, and is

. (Under the alternative,

could be an error

term that does not fulfill the rational expectations criteria, and/or a time varying risk premium, possibly
correlated with the interest differential.) Note in the regressions reported in this paper, the exact
formulas are used instead of the log approximations.
Note that the intercept

may be non zero while testing for UIP using equation (7). A non zero

alpha may reflect a constant risk premium (hence, we are really testing for a time-varying risk premium,
rather than risk neutrality per se) and/or approximation errors stemming from Jensen’s Inequality from
the fact that expectation of a ratio (the exchange rate) is not equal to the ratio of the expectation.
The literature testing variants of the uncovered interest rate parity hypothesis at short horizons
is enormous. Most of the studies fall into the category employing the rational expectations hypothesis;
in our lexicon, that means they are tests of the unbiasedness hypothesis. Estimates of equation (6) using
values for k that range up to one year typically reject the unbiasedness restriction on the slope
parameter. For instance, the survey by Froot and Thaler (1990), for instance, finds an average estimate
for β of -0.88.4 Bansal and Dahlquist (2000) provide more mixed results, when examining a broader set
of advanced and emerging market currencies. They also note that the failure of unbiasedness appears to
depend upon whether the US interest rate is above or below the foreign.5 Frankel and Poonawala (2010)

4

Similar results are cited in surveys by MacDonald and Taylor (1992) and Isard (1995). Meese and Rogoff (1983)
show that the forward rate is outpredicted by a random walk, which is consistent with the failure of the
unbiasedness hypothesis.
5
Flood and Rose (1996, 2002) note that including currency crises and devaluations, one finds more evidence for
the unbiasedness hypothesis.

5

show that for emerging markets more generally, the unbiasedness hypothesis coefficient is typically
more positive.6
The earliest studies that explored the UIP hypothesis over long horizons include Flood and
Taylor (1997) and Alexius (2001). Flood and Taylor (1997) explores the UIP relationship at three year
horizon pooling 21 currencies of mostly developed countries, with the U.S. Dollar as the base currency.
They estimate

to be 0.596 with a standard error of 0.195. However, the bond yields used are

heterogeneous, with varying maturities, so are difficult to interpret. Alexius (2001) finds evidence of UIP
holding at long horizon using 14 long term bonds of varying maturities, using a sample from 1957-97. As
the sample encompasses the Bretton Woods era and the associated capital control regime, those
findings are perhaps not applicable in current times.
Chinn and Meredith (2004) tested the UIP hypothesis at five year and ten year horizons for the
Group of Seven (G7) countries, and found greater support for the UIP hypothesis holding at these long
horizons than in shorter horizons of three to twelve months. The estimated coefficient on the interest
rate differentials were positive and were closer to the value of unity than to zero in general. The sample
used in that paper extended up to 2000. The panel findings are summarized in Figure 1.
Madarassy and Chinn (2002) document additional positive evidence of long horizon
unbiasedness for some non-G7 currencies. In contrast, Bekaert, Wing and Xie (2007) fails to find
evidence that unbiasedness holds better at long horizons.

6

There is an alternative approach that involves using survey-based data to measure exchange rate expectations.
Chinn and Frankel (1994) document that it is difficult to reject UIP for a broad set of currencies when using survey
based forecasts. Similar results are obtained by Chinn (2012), when extending the data up to 2009. These results
echo early findings by Froot and Frankel (1989). While we do not pursue this avenue in this paper (long horizon
expectations being difficult to obtain), it is useful to recall these findings when interpreting rejections of the joint
hypothesis of UIP and rational expectations.

3. Unbiasedness Estimated at Short and Long Horizons
In this paper we extend the sample up to 2011 and re-test the unbiasedness hypothesis using equation 7
both at the short and long horizons.7 Among the G7 countries, Italy, France and Germany adopted the
Euro, so the UIP regression on the Italian Lira, French Franc and German Mark could not be extended.
The Euro has too short a history to be tested at long horizon. Thus we were left with the U.S. Dollar,
Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar and British Pound for our analysis. We include results for the euro at the
short horizon. And to this group of currencies we added the Swiss Franc for which we were able to find
constant maturity yields at long horizons.
3.1 The Short Horizon
The stylized facts regarding exchange rate changes and interest differentials are well known. Ex post
exchange rate changes are highly variable, while interest differentials are not, and visually exhibit almost
no relationship with subsequent changes. For illustrative purposes, we display in Figures 2-4 the interest
rates and exchange rate changes (timed appropriately) for the US dollar-British pound pair at the three,
six and twelve month horizons, starting from 1979:Q1, and running through 2011:Q4. The

taken from Bloomberg. The data are sampled at quarterly frequencies with exchange rate and yield
observations recorded at the end of the quarter. A simple OLS regression line is included. Note that, in
line with the findings in the literature, the best-fit line is downward sloping. This characterization is true
for the other currency pairs.8
In Table 1, we quantify the extent of the downward slope, and present the OLS estimates of
obtained from estimating equation 7 for horizons of three, six months and twelve months. The standard

errors presented are Newey-West standard errors, correcting for moving average serial correlation in
the error term up to 2×(k-1) lags, following Cochrane (1991). This means we have used the most
conservative assumptions in terms of the degree of serial correlation.
The interest rate data start from the first quarter of 1979 for the U.S. Dollar, the Canadian
Dollar, the British Pound and the Japanese Yen. For the Swiss Franc the 3-month data begins from
1991:Q2, the 6-month data begins from 1996:Q4 and the 12-month data begins from 1997:Q1. The euro
data begins in 1999Q1.
The two panels contain the regression results with different base (home) currencies. In Panel A
the base currency is the U.S. Dollar. In Panel B the base currency is the British Pound. Note that when
testing the unbiasedness hypothesis for the two currencies in a regression setting, the choice of the
base currency can affect the estimate of .9 However, these differences are not substantial; that is why
we report the regression results for the exchange rate expressed as USD/GBP, but do not report the
corresponding results for GBP/USD.
First note that all the point estimates of

are negative. In most of the case the estimates of

are significantly different from one. The exceptions are the USD/CAD in Panel A, and the euro in both
panels. In the latter case, the relatively small sample explains the failure to reject the unbiasedness null;
the standard errors are relatively large.
In the last two row of each panel, we present estimates from constrained panel regression,
where the data for different currencies (with the exception of the Swiss Franc and the euro) are pooled
together and the estimates of

for all currencies are constrained to be equal to each other. The

regression controls for country fixed effects, thus allowing a different intercept (or

for each country.

standard errors. The estimates of

in the pooled regression are negative and different from one at the

one percent significance level for all base currency and horizons.
These estimates of

are consistent to what has been found in the literature, as reviewed in

Section 2. Hence, there does not seem to be anything particularly remarkable about our sample period,
in terms of this stylized fact of short horizon bias.
3.2 The Long Horizon

base currencies.

and

are the five year returns on constant maturity central government bonds.

Yields for constant maturity government bonds were obtained from central banks of their respective
countries10. When the central bank data did not go far back enough, we used the Chinn and Meredith
(2004) data to extend the series back to 1970. For the U.S. Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Japanese Yen and
British Pound, the sample starts in 1975, following Chinn and Meredith (2004). The sample for the Swiss
bonds starts in 1988.
A note in interpreting the results. The Table indicates a sample period. For instance, for the
Japanese yen, the sample start is indicated as 1979Q3. That means the first exchange rate depreciation
included in the sample is between 1974Q3 and 1979Q3, while the corresponding interest rate is
1974Q3. In general, we begin the samples so as to incorporate interest rate data that applies to the
floating rate period.
The chief distinction between Tables 1 and 2 is that in the latter, most of the point estimates are
positive. This contrasts with those in Table 1 which are uniformly negative. For four of the seven cases,
we cannot reject the null hypothesis of

10

estimates are positive (although when the British pound is used as the base currency, the coefficient is
indistinguishable from zero).
Table 3 presents the results for ten year horizon. The sample starts in 1983 for the U.S. Dollar,
Canadian Dollar, British Pound and Japanese Yen. The sample for the Swiss Franc starts in 1998. The
and

are the ten year returns on constant maturity central government bonds. The results are

slightly more favorable to the unbiasedness hypothesis than those reported in Table 2.
The distinction between the short and long horizon results can be conveyed by comparing
Figures 5 and 6 against Figures 2-4. Figures 5 and 6 depict, respectively, the 5 and 10 year exchange rate
change-interest differential relationships. What jumps out is that the regression line slopes are now
positive.
However, the above long horizon results are noticeably less favorable to the unbiasedness
hypothesis than those in Chinn and Meredith (2004). There, none of the estimated coefficients were
negative, and in Chinn and Meredith (2005) the results survived using the Deutschemark as a base
currency. If one focuses on estimates of

with U.S. dollar as the base currency, and ignore estimates

based on the pound, our results with the extended sample are much closer to Chinn and Meredith
(2004). Many of the low and negative estimates of

in Table 2 involve the Swiss Franc and the Japanese

Yen.
4. Accounting for the Findings
One can identify the sources of the identified pattern. First consider the failure of the hypothesis
This could arise because:

Our assumption about rational expectation does not hold and/or our assumption about no
time-varying risk premium does not hold.
10

.

ii)

The expectation error and/or the risk premium is correlated with the interest rate
differential.

Theoretical explanation for the failure of the unbiasedness hypothesis usually either focuses on
expectation error or they assume that rational expectation holds and explain the failure through a time
varying risk premium. Assuming for the moment expectations are unbiased, one can focus on the
existence of a time-varying risk premium, which leads to the result we obtain, namely
where

,

is the estimated beta for long horizon.

Given that covered interest parity holds we can rewrite our regression equation in logs as
follows.
(8)
This equation suggests that:

(9)

Using the definition of the risk premium, and imposing rational expectations, we can rewrite the above
expression in the following way:

(10)

Note that the assumption that the expectation error is orthogonal is helpful in obtaining a simple
expression because so many cross terms drop out.

(11)

The above expression highlights the importance of three components: the variance of the expected
exchange rate depreciation,

Chinn and Meredith (2004) accomplish this by assuming the risk premium term (actually just a
random shock without persistence) exists at the short horizon, in the context of a Keynesian macro
model with Taylor rule reaction functions.15 The implied risk premium at longer horizons is a direct
function of the short horizon risk premium. In the resulting model, the short interest rates are more
endogenous at short horizons than long, motivating the findings.16

12

The expectational error could be relatively smaller because purchasing power parity is expected to hold in the
long run, thus anchoring expectations. See Gagnon with Hinterschweiger (2011), Chapter 3.
13
Using survey data on exchange rate expectations from Chinn and Frankel (2002), one finds that the variance of
expected depreciation declines with horizon.
14
See Appendix for derivation.
15
This approach is inspired by McCallum’s (1994) model, which incorporates a simpler monetary reaction function.
See Engel and West (2006) and Mark (2009).

Chinn and Meredith (2005) discuss how long rates appear more weakly exogenous than short rates, in an error
correction framework.

There is substantial evidence exchange rate expectations are not unbiased. If one relaxes the
assumption of rational expectations, then the expression for

is much more complicated. The

numerator then depends on two additional terms – the covariance between the expectations error and
the risk premium, and the covariance between the expectations error and expected depreciation. This
complicates the determination of how the implied slope coefficient changes with the horizon. In
general, holding the other factors constant, the more positive the covariance terms, the more positive

5. Robustness Tests
5.1 Additional Countries
One can expand the set of countries examined (slightly) by using less appropriate data. Thus far, we
have employed constant maturity yields from government bonds, so that the yields correspond to the
exchange rate horizons. In Table 4, we report estimates using benchmark yields instead of constant
maturity yields. The ten year benchmark yields are yields on government bonds that mature close to ten
years but not in exactly ten years; hence there is some maturity mismatch. The advantage of benchmark
yields is that they are more widely available and do not need to be estimated.

17

We do not account for conditional second moments in the driving processes, such as in Domowitz and Hakkio
(1985), or Baillie and Bollerslev (1990).
18
Note that we have only addressed the relations between the interest rate differential and subsequent exchange
rate change. In order to deal with the correlation between interest differentials and contemporaneous exchange
rate strength, one needs a more complicated framework, as shown in Engel (2011).

14

In addition to long term benchmark yields on government bonds for the U.S., the U.K., Canada
and Japan we use benchmark yields for Australia, New Zealand and Denmark to test the UIP
relationship.19 Figure 7 shows the exchange rate depreciation – interest differential relationship.
In Panel A, we can see that all the estimates of
currency. The estimate of

are positive with the U.S. dollar as the base

for the Danish Kroner was 0.84, close to the theoretical value. When we

change the base currency to the British Pound, in Panel B, the estimate of

becomes negative for all

currency pairs save the Canadian dollar. It is not entirely surprising that the results change, since the two
interest rate series differ. The difference between the constant maturity and benchmark yields is shown
in Figure 8.
The differences are not sufficient to overturn the results entirely, though. The estimate of

is

approximately 0.4 in the constrained panel regression in both panels. This point estimate is substantially
closer to 1 than the short horizon estimates, although it is also significantly different from that value.
The fact that the panel slope coefficient is positive, when the individual slope coefficients are negative.
This suggests that the cross sectional variation is often critical in estimating the parameter.
5.2 The Financial Crisis of 2008
Did the 2008 financial crisis affect our results? One of the underlying assumptions in UIP is that
financial markets work efficiently in a way to remove arbitrage conditions. During the 2008 financial
crisis, investors were wary to invest and credit in financial markets dried up. Natural buyers of many
assets remained in the sidelines to allow fire sales. Under these circumstances, covered interest parity
failed to hold as default premia increased (Coffey, Hrung and Sarkar, 2009).

19

The benchmark yield series we collected for Switzerland have less than forty observations at the ten year
horizon so we do not include the Swiss Franc in our analysis.

15

In Table 5, we report estimates from the Fama regression for ten year constant maturity bond
returns, ending the sample at the second quarter 2008. In Panel A, with the U.S. Dollar as the base
currency, we can see that the estimates of
hypothesis of

are all positive and in two cases we cannot reject the null

for all currencies except the Swiss Franc. The UK regression results in particular are

not markedly different from the corresponding regression results in Table 4. The constrained panel
regression yields an estimate of about 0.6 which is closer to 1 than to zero.
Examining Panel B, the estimate of

from the Japanese Yen and British Pound pair is negative,

but the Swiss franc coefficient is positive, in contrast to the estimates based only on pre-financial crisis
data. The panel coefficient here is around the same magnitude as in Panel A, reinforcing the point that
the cross sectional dimension is important in obtaining precise estimates.
5.3 Low Interest Rate Countries: Japan and Switzerland
Even before the onset of the financial crisis, several countries had short term interest rates near the zero
interest bound. Perhaps more importantly for our results, long term interest rates were particularly
quite low in Japan and Switzerland, two currencies for which the estimated

is noticeably low. This

point is illustrated in Figure 9, which shows the time series for 10 year constant maturity yields.
There is no particular reason why the unbiasedness hypothesis should not hold when short
and/or long term rates strike the zero interest bound, as expected exchange rate changes could adjust
to make the parity condition hold. However, it seems worthwhile to investigate the sensitivity of the
estimates to inclusion of the low-interest rate period. We arbitrarily define 1996Q1 as the low interest
rate period for these two countries, and provide scatterplots in Figures 10-13, distinguishing between
the two periods. Clearly, the latter period is different.

16

In order to confirm these impressions, we re-estimate the Fama regression allowing for constant
and slope breaks.
(12)
The dummy variable takes a value of one such that the impact of interest rates in 1996:Q1 on exchange
rate depreciation through 2006:Q1 differs from that in the preceding period.
The results of estimating equation (12) for the yen and Swiss franc are reported in Table 6. They
indicate that post-1996 the unbiasedness relationship breaks down, with the slope coefficient
significantly different – and negative – in the latter period. The change in the slope coefficient is
statistically significantly different from zero except for the Japanese yen at the 10 year horizon. And in
that case, the slope change is statistically significant in a specification that omits a mean shift.
These findings confirm that the advent of low long term interest rates in Japan and Switzerland
is associated with the attenuation of evidence for the unbiasedness hypothesis at the long horizon – for
currency pairs involving these countries. However, it is not an explanation, as uncovered interest parity
is an arbitrage condition. Our accounting exercise highlights that a changing behavior of the exchange
risk premium, or a changing correlation of expectations errors with the right hand side variables, could
explain the difference in behavior in the latter period.20
6. Conclusion
This paper fills an important gap in the literature regarding long horizon interest rate parity.
When the U.S. Dollar is the base currency, estimates of

from long horizon unbiasedness regressions of

five and ten years are usually positive and closer to theoretical value of 1 than their short horizon
counterparts. In many of the cases especially at ten year horizon, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of
20

It could also be the case that the divergent behavior of these two currencies is associated with their large

However, when we extend the analysis to British Pound as the base the currency, we see a
number of estimates of

that are negative especially among currency pairs that do not include the U.S.

Dollar. Nonetheless, the panel estimates are uniformly positive. Taken together, we find considerable
evidence of the unbiasedness hypothesis not holding at the long horizon, despite the typically more
positive coefficients. This difference in performance across different currency pairs is consistent with a
time varying risk premium whose properties differ across currency pairs.
The findings are dependent upon the data used and the sample period. In particular, interest
rate data that are not exactly aligned with exchange rate depreciations exhibit less positive results. This
is not particularly surprising.
What is more economically interesting is the fact that the relationship between exchange rate
changes and interest differentials at short horizons has remained unchanged, while it has altered
noticeably in the recent environment of low long term interest rates in certain countries. Since several
other countries have experienced a similar phenomenon of low long term interest rates – including the
US – we should not be surprised if the positive association detected in previous studies is attenuated in
studies that incorporate more recent data.
Our accounting exercise highlights the conditions under which the pattern of results arise,
assuming that expectations errors are random, and uncorrelated with other contemporaneous factors.
However, we also show that if expectations errors are not random, then there are numerous reasons
why the pattern of short and long horizon coefficients arises. We reserve the task of paring down the
number of explanations for future research.

Appendix 2: Relation of Regression Coefficient to Components
The expression for the regression coefficient is given by equation (11):

Although we do not observe
