On the Welfare Cost of Consumption Fluctuations in the Presence of Memorable Goods

ABSTRACT
We propose a new classification of consumption goods into nondurable goods, durable goods and
a new class which we call "memorable" goods. A good is memorable if a consumer can draw current
utility from its past consumption experience through memory. We propose a novel consumption-savings
model in which a consumer has a well-defined preference ordering over both nondurable goods and
memorable goods. Memorable goods consumption differs from nondurable goods consumption in
that current memorable goods consumption may also impact future utility through the accumulation
process of the stock of memory. In our model, households optimally choose a lumpy profile of memorable
goods consumption even in a frictionless world. Using Consumer Expenditure Survey data, we then
document levels and volatilities of different groups of consumption goods expenditures, as well as
their expenditure patterns, and show that the expenditure patterns on memorable goods indeed differ
significantly from those on nondurable and durable goods. Finally, we empirically evaluate our model's
predictions with respect to the welfare cost of consumption fluctuations and conduct an excess-sensitivity
test of the consumption response to predictable income changes. We find that (i) the welfare cost of
household-level consumption fluctuations may be overstated by 1.7 percentage points (11.9% points
as opposed to 13.6% points of permanent consumption) if memorable goods are not appropriately
accounted for; (ii) the finding of excess sensitivity of consumption documented in important papers
of the literature might be entirely due to the presence of memorable goods.

We can entertain ourselves with memories of past pleasures ... [Adam Smith (1759)]
Much of the pleasure and pain we experience in daily life arises not from direct
experience - that is, “consumption” - but from contemplation of our own past or future
or from a comparison of the present against the past or future. The fact that experiences
are carried forward in time through memory enables them to affect welfare at later times.
[Quoted from Loewenstein and Elster (1992)]

Introduction

In this paper we propose to augment the canonical distinction of consumption goods into nondurable
and durable goods by a third category which we call memorable goods. Conceptually, a good is
memorable if a consumer draws utility from its past consumption experience, that is, through
memory.
Based on this idea we construct a novel consumption-savings model of nondurable and memorable goods. Memorable goods consumption impacts future utility through the accumulation of the
stock of memory. We demonstrate that in the model households optimally choose a non-smooth
consumption profile of memorable goods. Our model predicts that in the presence of a negative
income shock households optimally postpone their memorable goods consumption and reduce the
size of memorable goods expenditure spikes. We then empirically document significant differences
in expenditure patterns among nondurable, durable and memorable goods consumption, using the
Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX).
Finally, we present two applications of the model that demonstrate that the distinction between
nondurable and memorable goods matters for applied questions. First, we estimate the welfare cost
associated with consumption expenditure fluctuations, and find that relative to a benchmark model
in which all consumption is treated as nondurable goods consumption (and which is nested in our
framework), an explicit distinction and modeling of memorable goods reduces the estimated welfare
cost of idiosyncratic consumption fluctuations from 13.6% points to 11.9% points of permanent
consumption.
Finally we argue that the rejection of the permanent income hypothesis (PIH) based on the
excess sensitivity of consumption to expected tax refund receipts documented in the literature (and
concretely, by Souleles (1999)) might be entirely due to the presence of memorable goods, and that
our extension of a standard PIH-style model that explicitly incorporates memorable goods is fully
2

consistent with the empirical evidence. Specifically, we find that after separating memorable goods
from traditionally defined nondurable goods, nondurable goods consumption does not respond to
predictable federal income tax refunds.
In our model, households face income risk and choose expenditures on nondurable and memorable goods.1 Households obtain current utility from the consumption of nondurable goods, memorable goods and the stock of memory of past memorable goods consumption. The stock of memory
depreciates, but can in turn be augmented by expenditures on memorable goods. However, current
expenditures on memorable goods only add to the stock of memory if these expenditures exceed
the weighted average of past memorable goods consumption (the consumption experience has to be
memorable enough). Thus the model captures what we think are the salient features of memorable
consumption goods: the timing of the physical act of consumption and the utility this act generates
are de-coupled, and both expenditures as well as physical consumption occur infrequently as part of
the optimal household consumption plan, and in lumps when they occur. Note that the incidence
of lumpy expenditures in our model is not the result of any indivisibility or non-convex adjustment
cost, but rather is a deliberate choice to do something out of the ordinary.
It is empirically plausible to explain observed lumpy consumption choices without resorting
to indivisibilities in consumption for many nondurable consumption categories. For example, on
Christmas in the UK, the average number of presents that children receive is 18. Traditional
consumption theory predicts that parents should have given their children one or two gifts every
month instead of giving many gifts at the same time, while our model suggests that households
choose lumpy consumption expenditures in order to make this consumption experience memorable:
only an extraordinary consumption experience contributes to the stock of memory from Christmas.2
An immediate implication of our model is that although expenditures on memorable goods are
volatile, the associated utility flow that they generate is not. This implication of the model has
direct and profound consequences for the calculation of the welfare cost of consumption expenditure fluctuations because the infrequent and lumpy expenditure profile of memorable goods, as
implied by the optimal choices of households, might contribute little, if anything, to the welfare
1

We abstract from durable goods in the model because incorporating them is not needed for the application to

the welfare cost calculations of idiosyncratic income risk. It is conceptually straightforward to augment the model to
include these goods in exactly the same way the sizable literature on consumer durables has done.

In this paper we do not discuss the possibility of “negative memories”, such as the memory from a bad vacation
experience. It is possible to model bad memories using regret theory, but this is beyond the scope of this paper.

losses associated with volatile consumption expenditures for risk-averse households.3 When we
use the model with memorable goods to quantify the welfare losses of consumption fluctuations
induced by uninsurable idiosyncratic income risk, we find that the presence of memorable goods
overstates this cost by 1.7 percentage points, relative to the benchmark in which memorable goods
are lumped together with nondurable goods, as commonly done in the literature. This finding
stems directly from the facts that a) memorable goods expenditure constitutes a significant share
of the sum of expenditures on both nondurable and memorable goods (about 16%), b) expenditures
on memorable goods are very volatile over time and c) according to our model this volatility in
expenditures is not associated with a significant welfare loss, relative to a smooth consumption
profile. Indeed, according to our model a smooth consumption expenditure profile of memorable
goods is suboptimal.
A household’s consumption expenditure encompasses a wide array of goods with vastly different
characteristics. In order to make the concept of a memorable good useful, we need an operational
definition. Traditionally, consumption goods are differentiated only according to whether or not
they have a physically durable component. For a nondurable consumption good, expenditures
on the good and the physical, utility-generating consumption act typically occur frequently and
coincide. After the act of consumption the good is physically gone. Durable goods are typically
purchased infrequently, but their utility-yielding continuous service flow lasts as long as the durable
good is physically present. We take the key defining characteristics of a memorable good as its
infrequent expenditure and infrequent physical consumption (after which the good is physically
fully depreciated), combined with the continued utility flow (via memory) from the physically fully
consumed good. See Figure 1 for a representation of our classification. Thus a good is memorable
(as opposed to durable) if, even though it is not physically present anymore, the consumer derives
utility from its past consumption because she still remembers it.4 A memorable good (as opposed
to nondurable good) is infrequently purchased and infrequently consumed , while nondurable goods
3

One prominent example is the expenditure on weddings. Web sites dealing with the finances of marriages show

that the average budget for a wedding amounts to about $20, 000, while the average household income of a newly
married couple is $55, 000 annually. Many wedding expenditures, such as the expenditure for the honeymoon, the
reception site rental, outlays for photography and video services, rehearsal dinner etc., are commonly categorized
as nondurable consumption expenditures. We suggest that due to the (hopefully) memorable component in wedding consumption, there is no significant welfare loss associated with the nonsmoothness of household consumption
expenditures due to the incidence of a wedding.
4
Since a memorable good is not physically present anymore after their consumption they also cannot serve as
collateral. Thus, and in stark contrast to durable goods, memorable goods are typically hard to purchase on credit.

are frequently purchased and frequently consumed. For example, a luxurious dinner on a trip occurs
infrequently while an ordinary dinner at home happens on a daily basis. A typical set of goods that
we classify as memorable goods includes dining out, food for catered affairs, trips and vacations,
photographic rental and services, clothes and jewelry, and religious and welfare activities. Note
that these goods are typically classified as nondurable goods, see e.g., Cutler and Katz (1991) or
Souleles (1999).

Based on our heuristic definition of memorable goods we turn to the CEX and classify goods into
three categories (nondurable goods, durable goods and memorable goods; see Table 9 for a summary
and see Tables 10-12 for detailed information) and document salient features of their monthly and
quarterly expenditure patterns for individual households over a 12 month time period. We show
that memorable goods display more expenditure volatility than nondurable goods, and a higher
incidence of zero expenditures over the observed 12 month time period across households (which we

5

term inactivity). In contrast, memorable goods expenditures are less volatile and display a lower
incidence of zero expenditures than durable goods, both on a monthly basis and on a quarterly
basis.
Finally, we show that if one distinguishes expenditures on nondurable and memorable goods in
the excess sensitivity test of the permanent income hypothesis using anticipated income tax refunds
as in Souleles (1999), the rejection of the PIH is entirely due to the consumption response of expenditures on memorable goods. However, as we argued above, a lumpy change in expenditures on
memorable goods in response to an expected income change is fully consistent with our theoretical
model, which we view as a natural extension of the standard PIH style consumption-savings model
that incorporates memorable goods.
The paper is organized as follows. In the next subsection we briefly relate our work to the
existing literature before turning to a description of our model in Section 2. In that section we
develop our model of memorable goods and characterize its properties theoretically and numerically via simulations. Section 3 contains the results of a descriptive empirical analysis using CEX
consumption data. The purpose of this section is to empirically validate the basic predictions of the
theoretical model of Section 2. In the next two sections we turn to two applications of our theory.
In Section 4 we analyze the welfare cost of consumption fluctuations in the presence of memorable
goods, first using reduced form regressions, and then employing our structural model. In Section
5, we revisit Souleles’s (1999) empirical evidence against the permanent income hypothesis when
distinguishing between nondurable and memorable goods. Section 6 concludes. Details about the
theoretical properties of the model, the numerical solution procedure and the CEX data used in
the empirical analysis are relegated to the appendix.

1.1

Relation to the Literature

Our paper is related to several strands of the empirical and theoretical literature on household
consumption and its response to income shocks. On the empirical side a recent set of papers
uses disaggregate household-level data to document stylized facts about the detailed composition
of consumption expenditures across different categories. Charles and Stephens (2006) finds that
the level and composition of household consumption expenditure change significantly over the
business cycle, and that this change depends on their income. Aguiar and Hurst (2008) document
that the behavior of total expenditures on nondurable goods over the life cycle masks substantial
heterogeneity in the profiles of individual consumption sub-components.
6

On the theoretical side, our paper contributes to the literature on modeling household dynamic
consumption and savings choices, by proposing and analyzing a novel consumption-savings model
with memorable goods. Our paper therefore complements the large literature, starting from Friedman (1957) and Modigliani and Brumberg (1954), that models nondurable consumption choices,
as well as the literature on modeling expenditures and consumption on durable goods (see e.g.
Mankiw (1982)) and the work that proposes non-time-separable preferences over streams of consumption (see e.g. the habit persistence models of Abel (1990) or Campbell and Cochrane (1999)
or models with recursive preferences as in Epstein and Zin (1989)).
It has long been understood that an individual may care about past consumption because of
the memories associated with past consumption. See, for example, the quotations of Smith (1759)
and Loewenstein and Elster (1992) at the beginning of the introduction. The formal incorporation
of utility derived from past consumption dates (at least) back to Strotz’s classic paper on dynamic
consistency (Strotz (1955)). His formulation incorporated utility from past consumption to allow for
“the possibility that a person is not indifferent to his consumption history but enjoys his memories
of it”.5
Strotz’s model is very general and can easily accommodate the notion of memories that is the
focus of this paper, but is overly general for our purposes in some other respects. Strotz puts little
structure on the evolution of preferences, that is, the connection between individuals’ preferences at
different points in his life over life-long consumption paths. This lack of restrictions placed on the
evolution of an individual’s preferences can lead to time inconsistency, which is what Strotz wanted
to point to. Agents’ preferences in our model fit into Strotz’s framework: an agent will have welldefined preferences over any set of life-long consumption paths, and those preferences will evolve
over time. At any given point in time, an agent will have preferences over consumption paths,
and the preferences over future consumption will depend on previous consumption. Unlike the
general case in Strotz, however, in our formulation preferences are fully time consistent. Thus, we
separate the consequences of agents enjoying memories of past consumption from the conceptually
different issue of time inconsistency. We view as one advantage of our approach the fact that our
model is a straightforward extension of standard consumption-savings models, which allows a clear
5

Strotz began with an individual comparing all possible life-long consumption paths, but at different points in his

life. In this framework the individual at some given date t may strictly prefer a consumption path c to path ĉ, when
the paths c and ĉ are identical from t onward if consumption path c generated fond memories prior to period t that
are absent in path ĉ.

7

understanding of the role memories play for optimal dynamic consumption decisions.
We present two applications of the empirical distinction between nondurable and memorable
goods. When we revisit Souleles’s (1999) empirical test of the permanent income hypothesis using
income tax return data, we contribute to the massive body of work that uses household level
data to assess the extent to which consumption responds to expected changes in income (starting
with Hall (1978)) as well as income shocks.6 Hamermesh (1982) notes that if agents cut back on
total expenditure there will be a bigger proportional impact on luxuries. Zeldes (1989) tests the
permanent income hypothesis and finds that an inability to borrow against future labor income
affects the consumption of a significant portion of the population. Nelson (1994) has pointed out
that many nondurable goods feature lumpy consumption and infrequent purchases. Parker (1999)
finds consumers do not perfectly smooth their consumption expenditure across expected income
changes; moreover, the consumption goods that have larger intertemporal elasticity of substitution
respond more to predictable income changes. Souleles (1999) produces significant evidence of excess
sensitivity in the response of households’ nondurable consumption to their income tax refunds even
without the presence of liquidity constraints. Browning and Crossley (2000) show that luxuries have
a high intertemporal substitution elasticity and thus are easy to postpone. Browning and Crossley
(1999) show that liquidity constrained agents cut back on expenditures on small durables during a
low income spell much more than would be suggested by the income elasticities of these goods in
‘normal’ times, while nondurable expenditures flows are much smoother than would be predicted
in a model without durables. Charles and Stephens (2006) find that in bad economic times the
lower income groups reduced the shares of their total outlays, and these downward adjustments are
primarily concentrated among reductions in outlays devoted to entertainment and personal care
expenditures.
Finally, our paper contributes to the literature that measures the welfare cost of consumption
fluctuations. Using aggregate consumption data, Lucas (1987) calculates that the welfare gains
from eliminating all aggregate consumption fluctuations is less than one-hundredth of one percent
of consumption when preferences are logarithmic. However, using micro-level consumption data,
the welfare losses of idiosyncratic consumption fluctuations are orders of magnitude larger, following
the same Lucas (1987) approach. Gorbachev (2011) argues that the welfare losses of household-level
nondurable consumption fluctuations equal 4.15% of annual nondurable consumption, under log

results are in the same order of magnitude as the ones documented in this paper when we use CEX
data and ignore memorable goods.

The Model

In this section, we present a novel consumption-savings model with memorable goods and discuss
its qualitative predictions. Denote by Cmt and Cnt real contemporaneous consumption expenditures on memorable goods and nondurable goods, respectively. We assume that households have
preferences defined over contemporaneous consumption Cmt and Cnt , and in addition, over the
stock of memory Mt from past memorable consumption expenditures. Specifically, we assume that
household preferences can be represented by a period utility function of the following form7
U (Cnt , Cmt , Mt ) = ξ

1−γ
Cnt
(αCmt + (1 − α)Mt )1−γ
+ (1 − ξ)
.
1−γ

(1)

The utility from memorable goods consumption is the weighted sum of the direct utility obtained
from the act of consumption Cmt and the stock of memory Mt from past memorable goods consumption, with weight α controlling the importance of immediate memorable goods consumption
Cm relative to the stock of memory Mt . When α = 1, memorable goods become standard nondurable goods. The parameter ξ governs the relative importance of nondurable goods consumption
to memorable goods consumption, and 1/γ measures the intertemporal elasticity of substitution,
assumed to be the same for nondurable and memorable goods.
In addition to specifying how instantaneous utility depends on the stock of memory we need
to take a stance on how it is updated over time. In order to capture the idea that only an
unusual consumption experience contributes to the stock of memory, we introduce a variable, Nt ,
to represent the threshold value for a consumption experience to be indeed memorable. We assume
that memorable goods expenditure Cmt only adds to the stock of memory Mt if it exceeds the
threshold value of being memorable Nt at time t. Specifically, the law of motion of the stock of

A more general utility specification that relaxes the additive separability between nondurable and memorable

goods would be given by

memory Mt is characterized by
Mt+1 = (1 − δ m )Mt + max{Cmt − Nt , 0}

(2)

where δ m ∈ [0, 1] measures the speed with which the stock of memory depreciates.8
The threshold value Nt itself could in principle depend on the individual’s complete history of
past consumption experience up to time t, i.e., Nt = N (Cm1 , Cm2 , . . . , Cmt ). We parameterize the
evolution of Nt as an AR(1) process in the following parsimonious way,
Nt+1 = (1 − ρ)Nt + ρCmt

(3)

where ρ ∈ [0, 1] controls the weight of current memorable goods consumption on the threshold
value. When ρ = 1, only the most recent immediate memorable goods consumption matters for the
past consumption experience, that is, Nt = Cm,t−1 . In contrast, when ρ is close to 0, the impact of
Cmt on the threshold value of being memorable is small.
To illustrate the conceptual difference in the stock of memories M and the threshold value of
being memorable N , we take a completely smooth consumption plan, Cm,t = C̄m for all t, as an
example. In this case, the threshold value of being memorable is Nt = C̄m while the stock of
memories is Mt = 0.
The standard CRRA utility function that does not differentiate between memorable goods and
nondurable goods and has no memorable goods stock is a special case of our utility function in
equation 1, with ξ = 1

Ct1−γ
U (Ct ) =
1−γ

(4)

and Ct = Cnt + Cmt .
Given the period utility function, the intertemporal household consumption-savings problem is
completely standard. The household faces a stochastic income process {Yt } and aims at maximizing
8

This feature of the model will insure that memorable goods are consumed infrequently even in the absence of

nonconvex adjustment costs and indivisibilities. It therefore constitutes an important difference to the standard way
consumer durables are modeled.
With memorable goods the way modeled here a consumer who has incurred a large memorable expense this period
may well have higher utility if she postponed further expenditures from next period to a later period since there would
be a greater increment to the memory stock. The standard treatment of durable goods instead adds the expenditure
on a durable good to its stock and specifies a utility flow from that stock, independent of the timing of the expenses
that led to this stock.

where St is the beginning of the period position of riskless assets. The exogenous net return r

St+1 ≥ 0.

For the stochastic process governing monthly income, we assume that Yt is determined as the sum

Therefore, the conditional distribution of zt is given by zt ∼ N (ρz zt−1 , σ 2 ), and the uncondi2

given by E(Yt ) = E(exp(ȳ + zt )) = exp(ȳ +

In addition, we make the following assumption:

Assumption 1
(1 + r)β ≤ 1,

This specification is equivalent to assuming a process of the form: ln Yt = (1 − ρz )ȳ + ρz ln Yt−1 + t .

2.1

Numerical Model Solution

The household’s maximization problem can be recast as a dynamic programming problem with
state variables (M, N, S, z). It is given by

V (M, N, S, z) = max0 U (Cn , Cm , M ) + βE[V (M 0 , N 0 , S 0 , z 0 )|z]
Cm ,S

Cn = Y + (1 + r)S − Cm − S 0
M 0 = (1 − δ m )M + max{Cm − N, 0}
N 0 = (1 − ρ)N + ρCm
S0 ≥ 0
ln Y = ȳ + z
z 0 = ρz z + .
The model with memorable goods consumption in general has no analytical solution, so we need
to solve it numerically. The main challenges are that with 4 continuous state variables (M, N, S, z)
the state space is large. In addition, our specification of memorable good results in a maximization
that is not a convex programming problem, and the resulting policy functions (especially for Cm )
will be discontinuous in the state variables, especially the stock of memory M and the threshold of
being memorable N . To deal with the large state space and the discontinuity in policy function for
memorable goods consumption, we use a Smolyak sparse grid collocation algorithm and approximate the value function (but not the policy functions) by a linear combination of polynomials at
each grid point.10 Further details on the solution algorithm are provided in Appendix B.

2.2

Qualitative Features

In order to derive insights into the qualitative features of our model it is instructive to investigate
individuals’ optimal consumption profile in a “frictionless” case where there is no income risk and no
binding borrowing constraints. We then turn to numerical simulation results from a parameterized
version of the model.
10

See Smolyak (1963), Barthelmann et al. (2000), Krueger and Kubler (2004), and Malin et al. (2007) for the

details of Smolyak’s algorithm.

2.2.1

Theoretical Results

When there is no income risk, no borrowing constraint and (1+r)β = 1, the standard consumptionsavings model (without memorable goods) predicts that households optimally choose a completely
smooth consumption plan. However, in the presence of memorable goods, households don’t find
it optimal to choose a smooth consumption plan, even in this case. In particular, consider a
special case where the threshold value of being memorable depends only on previous memorable
goods consumption expenditures, i.e., ρ = 1. Using the first order conditions of an individual’s
optimization problem, we can show that a smooth consumption plan is never optimal. The result
is summarized in Proposition 1. The details of the proof are provided in Appendix A.
Proposition 1 If there is no income risk and no borrowing constraint and (1 + r)β = 1 and ρ = 1,
then a smooth memorable consumption plan is never optimal for any initial memory stock M0 > 0.
That is, a consumption plan Cm,t = C m for all t, is never optimal, given M0 > 0.
In general, when ρ < 1, the dynamics of Cm,t and St+1 are more complicated. Therefore, in
order to gain some insights into the mechanics of the model we report its key quantitative features,
obtained via simulations, in the remainder of this section.
2.2.2

Simulation Results

In order to provide further insights into the qualitative predictions of the model we rely on numerical
simulations for specific parameter values. The parameters used are the same as in the quantitative
welfare analysis in Section 4, and thus their calibration is discussed in detail in that section. We
summarize the parameter choices in Table 1. The model is calibrated and solved for a monthly
frequency.
In order to characterize the key qualitative features of the model we display simulated consumption and asset time paths for 24 periods (months), for three different realized paths of income shocks.
In the benchmark scenario (I) we set the realization of all income shocks to be zero, that is t = 0 for
t = 1, . . . , 24 and z0 = 0. This thought experiment shows the consumption and savings dynamics
of the model in the absence of any shock.11 The second scenario (II) explores the response of the
household to a negative income shock; 12 months of zero income shocks are followed by a one-time,
11

Of course the policy functions on which these simulations are based fully take into account the stochastic structure

of the model.

Finally, the third scenario (III) investigates whether the households’ consumption-savings response
to income shock features asymmetries by simulating a positive income shock symmetric to that of
the negative income shock scenario (II).13
Further, to assess the importance of binding borrowing constraints we report the simulations for
two sets of initial conditions, one in which the endogenously evolving state variables (M, N, S) are
set to their long run average, and one in which M0 = N0 = 0 and S0 = 0. Last, to understand the
role of memories on households’ optimal consumption-savings decisions, we report the simulated
consumption and savings response in the special case when α = 1. In this case, the stock of memory
does not enter households’ utility function, and thus memorable goods become standard nondurable
goods.
First, turning to household behavior in the absence of realized income shocks (benchmark
scenario), we observe from Figure 2(a) that, for a household with liquid wealth, nondurable consumption is smooth over time (and slightly decreasing, since β(1 + r) < 1), whereas memorable
consumption expenditures exhibit one positive spike in every three months. Although the frequency
12

That is, the sequence of {t }24
t=1 is given by t = 0 for all t 6= 13, and 13 = −2σ  = −0.16. Therefore the absolute

change in income at period 13 is ∆Y13 = exp(ȳ − 0.16) − exp(ȳ) = −0.1260. Recall that mean income is normalized
to one.
13
To ensure that the increase in income in scenario III is of the same magnitude as the decrease in income in
scenario II (∆Y13 = exp(ȳ + 13 ) − exp(ȳ) = 0.1260), we set the one-time positive income shock to be 13 = 0.1379.

14

and size of the memorable consumption expenditure spikes depends on the exact values of the parameters of the model (and especially on how fast memories depreciate measured by δ m , and how
important current expenditures Cm are in refreshing them, measured by ρ), the existence of spikes
and periods of inactivity does not.

Figure 2: Changes in Consumption and Savings (Benchmark Scenario)
Moreover, although the dynamics of nondurable consumption is largely unaffected by the presence of memorable goods for asset-rich households,14 the same is not true for liquidity constrained
households, as Figure 2(b) demonstrates. For a household without financial wealth, it is still optimal
to consume memorable goods in spikes; however, they become smaller and more frequent. For an
asset-rich household, the positive spikes are two times as large as the household’s 24-month average
memorable goods expenditure, whereas for a household which is at or near borrowing constraint,
the relative size of a positive memorable goods expenditure is significantly smaller. Interestingly,
if the borrowing constraint is binding a positive spike in memorable consumption must be met
by a fall in nondurable consumption (given that income is constant). Consequently nondurable
consumption fluctuates as well, even in the absence of any realized income shocks, and even with
utility from nondurable and memorable consumption being additively separable.15
Next we turn to household behavior in response to negative and positive income shocks (scenar14

If the utility function was not separable between nondurable consumption and memorable goods this statement

would not apply, since then spikes in memorable consumption would affect the marginal utility from nondurable
consumption.

households and liquidity-constrained households respectively.

ios II and III, respectively). Table 2 Panel A summarizes the simulated consumption and savings
response to negative and positive income shocks, and Figures 3 and 4 display the simulated time
paths for consumption and savings. For comparison, Table 2 Panel B reports the simulated consumption and savings response in the special case when memorable goods are standard nondurable
goods (α = 1).
There is a significant difference in the nondurable consumption response to income shocks
between households at or near the borrowing constraints and those with significant positive wealth.
Furthermore, this difference is asymmetric with respect to positive and negative income shocks.
Households far removed from the borrowing constraint behave in a way that is typical in standard
consumption-savings models without memorable goods (as shown in Figures 3(a) and 4(a)). They
reduce nondurable consumption in response to a (persistent, but not permanent) negative income
shock and increase it (somewhat less) when facing a positive income shock of the same magnitude.16
The presence of memorable goods has a much more significant impact on the dynamics of consumption in response to income shocks for asset-poor households. As discussed above, nondurable
consumption fluctuates for these households even in the absence of shocks (see Figure 2(b)), and
the occurrence of income movements modifies this behavior. To interpret the figures and the table, note that the period of the shock (t = 13) was planned to be a period of memorable goods
abstention for asset-constrained households, and the subsequent period (t = 14) would display a
memorable goods spike in the absence of a shock.
¿From Figure 3(b), we observe that a negative income shock leads to a delay in a memorable
consumption spike by one month (to t = 15) and a decline in the spike (compare Figure 3(b) with
Figure 2(b)). A positive income shock induces an anticipation of the memorable goods spending
spike by one month (to t = 13, compare Figure 4(b) with Figure 2(b)). The budget constraint
for borrowing-constrained households, in conjunction with the abstention of memorable goods consumption in period t = 13 then implies an increase in nondurable consumption in the period of
the negative income shock17 , although this increase is smaller than what was planned prior to the
shock (see again Figure 3). In the period following the shock the fall in nondurable consumption is
again smaller than “planned” as the abstention in memorable purchases is extended by one period,
16

The magnitude of these changes is smaller in the model with memorable goods than in the model without them

(compare panel A and panel B) since future consumption of memorable goods responds to the income shocks as well
in the former model.
17
This explains the perhaps surprising sign on the nondurable consumption response to an income decline documented for the liquidity-constrained households in Table 2 (Panel (a), second column).

changes in the timing of the spike

Note: Households who are not constrained start from the long run average of the state variable level
(S̄, M̄ , N̄ ), the constrained households refer to households that start from (S1 = 0, M1 = 0, N1 = 0); and
K = αCm + (1 − α)M . The first 8 rows compare the changes in consumption and savings immediately
before and after the income shock. The last row compares the timing of the spike immediately after
the income shock to the timing in the case with zero income shocks: -1 for a one period delay, 0 for no
change, 1 for one period forward.

17

relative to the no-shock benchmark.
Thus negative income shock reduces the planned increase in nondurable consumption since the
current month features abstention in memorable consumption purposes (compare again Figures
3(b) to Figure 2(b) respectively). This result bears resemblance to Browning and Crossley (1999)’s
analysis of the role of semi-durable goods in coping with income losses. Here households let their
stock of memories depreciate longer in response to a negative income shock. In this sense they access
their internal “memory capital market” to smooth out the negative income shock (see Figure 8 in
the appendix for the time paths of state variables in the case of a negative income shock).

Figure 4: Changes in Consumption and Savings (Scenario III: Positive Shock)
This mechanism also works in the upward direction. For a positive income shock households
18

move the purchase of memorable goods forward. In the period of the positive shock they also
respond by increasing nondurable consumption (with a spike that is smaller than in the absence
of the positive income innovation). As standard permanent income logic dictates nondurable consumption is persistently higher from that point on, but continues to fluctuate to permit memorable
consumption spikes for households near the borrowing constraint.
The previous discussion suggests that the introduction of the memory stock into the utility
function plays a key role in determining households’ consumption and savings behavior. In the
special case with α = 1, the stock of memories does not enter households’ utility functions, and
memorable goods become standard nondurable goods. As seen in Figures 12 to 18 in the appendix,
not surprisingly households then optimally choose a smooth consumption plan both for Cn and Cm
in the absence of income shocks. Both memorable consumption and nondurable goods consumption
fall in response to a negative income shock and increase in response to a positive income shock.
Before using this model for an evaluation of the welfare cost of consumption fluctuations we first
briefly employ household consumption data from the CEX to document that expenditure patterns
indeed differ significantly between nondurable and memorable (as well as durable) consumption
goods in the way predicted by the theory. It is these data that will also be used to structurally
estimate the model in Section 4 as well as to conduct the empirical analysis of the consumption
response to anticipated tax rebates in Section 5 of the paper.

Data

In this section we describe the US Consumer Expenditure data (CEX) that we use for our empirical
analysis.

3.1
3.1.1

Sample and Consumption Categories
Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX)

The data is obtained from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) for the period 1980-2003.18
The CEX, constructed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) contains comprehensive measures
of consumption expenditures and earnings for a large cross section of households. In addition,
18

Starting in 2004 the CEX introduced many changes in both income and consumption expenditure variables that

reduce the comparability with the data from the earlier period.

19

and crucially for our purposes, it has a limited panel dimension.19 The CEX is a rotating panel
of households that are selected to be representative of the U.S. population. Each household is
interviewed every three months over five calendar quarters, and in every quarter 20 percent of the
sample is replaced by new households. In the first preliminary interview the CEX procedures are
explained to the members of the household, and they are asked to keep track of their expenditures
for future interviews. After this first interview, each household is subsequently interviewed for
a maximum of four more times, once every three months. In each of these interviews, detailed
information is collected on household consumption expenditures for the last three months. In
the second and fifth interviews, demographic and income data are collected for each household,
including earnings and income information for the previous 12 months.
We include in our sample only households that are classified as complete income reporters in
the CEX. We also drop observations that report zero food expenditures, and those who report only
food expenditures. In addition, we exclude all observations of households for which the household
reference person is below 21 or above 64, and those households with negative or zero disposable
income (as defined later in this section). Finally, we exclude households classified as rural, and
those households who do not have consecutive 12 months of consumption expenditure reports. Our
final sample consists of 28, 969 households with the full 12 months of consecutive consumption
expenditure observations. Table 13 and Table 14 report selected summary statistics of our sample.
3.1.2

Consumption Categories

In this section we provide an empirical classification of the set of memorable goods (MG), nondurable goods (ND) and durable goods. The set of memorable goods (MG) is meant to comprise
goods for which the timing of the physical act of consumption and the utility this act generates
are typically de-coupled, and for which both expenditures as well as physical consumption occur
infrequently. It should be noted that our choice of which goods to include in the set of memorable
goods is subjective.
We define memorable goods (MG) as food away from home, food for catered affairs, alcohol out,
nondurable expenditure on trips and vacations, clothing and shoes, jewelry and watches, photographic rental and services, and religious and welfare activities.20 Nondurable expenditure on trips
19

The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) has extended its coverage of consumption in recent years, but the

higher frequency of observations in the CEX (as well as the longer overall sample with comprehensive consumption
data) make us prefer the CEX over the PSID consumption data for this study.
20
Prior to 2001Q2, expenditures on religious and welfare activities were asked only in the 5th interview, and the

20

and vacations includes nondurable expenditure of food, alcohol, entertainment, and transportation
on trips and vacations. For a complete and detailed list of memorable goods, see Table 11.
Our definition of nondurable goods (ND) encompasses most, but not all, of the goods traditionally classified as nondurable goods (Lusardi (1996), Parker (1999), Krueger and Perri (2006),
Aguiar and Hurst (2008)). We include in ND food at home, food at school, meals received as pay,
tobacco, alcohol at home, utility, household operation, rents for the primary residence (including
rental equivalent), local transportation, business services, education, and health care. For more
detailed information on nondurable consumption goods, refer to Table 10.
Finally we include in the set of durable goods furniture, motor vehicles (net outlays and car
loans), and recreation equipment. The durable goods expenditure does not include expenditures
on housing assets, since we have already included a measure of the service flow from housing assets
(the rental equivalent) in our nondurable goods expenditure variable. More detailed information is
contained in Table 12. Total household consumption expenditures is the sum of memorable goods,
nondurable goods and durable goods.
3.1.3

CEX Data Frequencies

Because we are interested in how households change expenditures in different consumption categories over time, a panel dimension with a reasonably high frequency of observations is desirable.
Although the CEX interview is conducted at quarterly frequency, the highest frequency for consumption data is monthly. Specifically, each expenditure reported by a household is identified by
Universal Classification Code (UCC) and the month in which the expenditure occurred in CEX
Monthly Expenditure (MTAB) file.
The algorithm that BLS used to construct MTAB files after each interview quarter is called
the Time Adjustment (TA henceforth) process. It maps each UCC into a monthly time frame. In
general, whenever the reference month information is available, the TA algorithm maps the UCC
to the exact month in which the expenditure occurs (for example, all trip related expenditures,
expenditures on jewelry, food for catered affairs and cars). There are also many UCCs (mostly
representing nondurable goods) where only quarterly information is available, the TA algorithm
amounts have been divided by 12 to transform the data into a monthly expenditure in the ITAB files. Starting from
2001Q2, households are asked to report their religious and welfare activities expenditures made for the previous three
month period prior to the month of the interview in MTAB file. Thus by construction, the expenditure of religious
and welfare activities are very “smooth” across the year for each individual before 2001Q2, and there is an upward
“jump” before and after interview quarter 2001Q2 due to measurement issues.

21

converts monthly expenditure by dividing quarterly expenditure by 3 (e.g. food at home).
The TA algorithm is complex. Moreover, because the TA algorithm is based on the very detailed
UCCs, when we aggregate more than 600 UCCs into 57 consumption categories, many of these
consumption categories contain “mixed” frequency information.21 Based on the 2006 TA mapping
algorithm,22 we report the underlying frequencies of our consumption expenditure categories as an
illustration (Table 15). We say a consumption category contains monthly information, if any of the
UCCs contained in this category has information on specific expenditure month in CEX data. As
we can see from Table 15, most of the consumption categories contains monthly information, and
this is especially true for memorable goods and durable goods expenditures.
In addition, as a robustness check, in Section 3.2 we conduct our empirical analysis both for
data at monthly frequency (our preferred data) and for data at quarterly frequency.

3.2

Descriptive Analysis

Before turning to the two applications of our theory we briefly document the salient descriptive
facts for expenditures on memorable goods from the data. Specifically we provide measures of
volatility and the frequency and size of spikes in consumption expenditures for different consumption
categories. We will demonstrate that expenditures on memorable goods are more volatile, more
infrequent and lumpy, relative to expenditures on nondurable goods. Section 3.2.1 documents
the expenditure shares, volatility measures and inactivity of different consumption categories, and
Section 3.2.2 displays summary measures of lumpiness of expenditures on different consumption
goods.
3.2.1

Consumption Expenditure Volatility

In this section, we document the extent of household-level consumption expenditure volatility
associated with each of the three consumption goods categories. Specifically, monthly consumption
expenditure volatility of good i for household h is measured as the standard deviation of household
consumption expenditures over 12 months, divided by the household-specific 12 month average

has zero expenditure over 12 months in category i, and we assign volhi = 0.24 We call a household
who did not incur any expenditure on consumption good i over the 12-month observation period
an “inactive household” for consumption good i. The inactive ratio is the number of inactive
households divided by the number of all households. It is a descriptive measure of the purchasing
frequency associated with a particular consumption category i.
The first three columns of Table 16 report the average consumption share, volatility measures
and the inactive ratio, for the entire sample and also for selected subsamples of households with
low and with high cash at hand. Specifically, we measure cash at hand as the sum of the amount in
checking and savings and disposable income. We then sort households by cash at hand and report
results for those households in the bottom and the top quintiles of the cash at hand distribution.
We think of the first group of households as likely to be liquidity-constrained and the latter group
as very unlikely to be liquidity-constrained.
Nondurable goods constitute 77.94% of the total outlays and have the lowest average volatility.
Memorable goods constitute 14.19% of the total outlays and are 3 times as volatile as nondurable
goods. Durable goods expenditures account for 7.9% of total outlays, and are 7 times as volatile
as those on nondurable goods. We also report the measured expenditure volatilities based on data
at quarterly frequency (Table 17). As one can see from tables 16 and 17, the relative magnitudes
of the volatility measures of these consumption goods groups do not change as we move from
monthly to quarterly frequency. Quarterly memorable goods expenditures are 3 times as volatile
23

This measure is analogous to that of Davis and Kahn (2008). Davis and Kahn (2008) measure volatility of

consumption as the absolute value of the log change in 6 month consumption expenditures for each household,
and then average over households. However, because we need to allow for zero expenditures in some consumption
categories for our analysis, instead of taking log changes for each household we calculate the coefficient of variation.
24
Note that our volatility measure is a conservative measure of consumption volatility for memorable and durable
goods with infrequent expenditures because we assign a zero volatility to households for which we do not observe any
positive expenditure during the 12 month observation period (inactive households). If we drop the households who
have zero expenditure throughout the 12 month periods, the measured volatility of memorable goods and durable
goods expenditures would be significantly higher.

23

as nondurable goods, and durable goods expenditures are 6 times as volatile as expenditures on
nondurable goods. 0.48 percent of households do not have any memorable goods purchase over
the 12 month periods, 3.89 percent of households do not have any durable goods purchase in
the sample period. For completeness, Table 18 and Table 19 in the appendix report the measured
volatility of 57 detailed consumption goods categories based on monthly expenditures and quarterly
expenditures respectively.
Comparing the expenditure patterns between liquidity-constrained households and asset-rich
households, memorable goods constitute a much larger share of total outlays for asset-rich households (18.8%) than for liquidity-constrained households (9.2%). The measured volatility of both
memorable goods and durable goods is smaller for asset-rich households than for liquidity-constrained
households. 1.7% of liquidity-constrained households did not have any memorable goods expenditure during the 12 month reference periods and 0.1% of asset-rich households did not have any
memorable goods consumption in the reference periods.
Our theoretical model also predicts that households optimally choose to have zero expenditure
in memorable goods in certain periods (which we refer as inactive periods). To further investigate
whether such expenditure patterns exist in our defined memorable goods categories, we document
the frequency of expenditure inactivity for the following six detailed memorable goods categories:
food for catered affairs, food on trips and vacations, entertainment on trips and vacations, total expenditure on trips and vacations, clothes and shoes, jewelry and watches. We also report
the inactivity patterns for two durable goods categories, new and used vehicles (net outlay), and
tires, tubes, accessories and other parts, as a comparison with memorable goods. From Figure 19
we observe that indeed, memorable goods, as well as durable goods, display infrequent monthly
expenditures. In fact, with the exception of the clothes and shoes categories the mode of the distribution of months of inactivity is 12, that is, most households are expenditure-inactive for a given
consumption category for each of the twelve months the household spends in the sample.
3.2.2

Consumption Expenditure Spikes

Another salient expenditure pattern for memorable goods, as shown in our model simulation, is
that when expenditures on memorable goods occur, they occur in lumps. To investigate the lumpy
expenditure patterns in memorable goods expenditure, we denote by nhi ∈ {0, 1, . . . , 11} the number
of expenditure spikes of size κ > 1 relative to household i’s mean expenditure on good i. Thus nhi

24

is defined as:
nhi =

12
X
l=1

h
1{l : Ei,l
> κ · Ēih },

κ > 1.

For each consumption category i we now plot the frequency distribution of the number of
expenditure spikes nhi of size at least size κ = 1.5 among households who report at least one
positive expenditure on goods i within the 12-month periods. This statistic gives us a measure of
expenditure lumpiness for different consumption categories. Figure 20 shows that most households
have at least one consumption expenditure spike within a 12 month period for these selected
memorable and durable goods, and the expenditure on these goods tends to be quite lumpy.
We also summarize frequencies of spikes and relative size of spikes for total consumption outlays,
as well as separately for nondurables, memorable goods and durables In the last two columns of
Tables 18 and 19, for the entire sample but also for selected subsamples of households with low and
with high cash at hand. We measure the average frequency of consumption spikes as the average
number of consumption spikes divided by the total number of reference periods. To measure the
relative size of consumption spikes, we normalize households’ expenditure spikes by household-level
12-month average total consumption outlays. One prediction from our model (derived through
simulations) is that liquidity constrained households choose more frequent spikes of memorable
goods expenditures. This is indeed the case as the fourth column of tables 16 and 17 show. A
related prediction holds that asset rich individuals experience larger consumption spikes when they
occur, indeed something present in the data (see the last column of tables 16 and 17).
To summarize our descriptive empirical findings, expenditures on memorable consumption goods
are a significant share of a typical household’s budget, and they display substantially larger fluctuations at a monthly (and quarterly) frequency than nondurable consumption goods. Furthermore,
memorable goods expenditures in each category spike once or twice during the year, and are otherwise characterized by a higher inactive ratio.
However, as argued in Section 2 these spikes and spells of inactivity might well be optimal even
in the absence of idiosyncratic income shocks or/and incomplete financial markets, and thus might
not contribute to welfare losses from inefficient consumption fluctuations. We will now turn to a
formal quantitative investigation of this point, using the CEX data described above.

25

4

Welfare Cost Analysis

One immediate implication of our model of memorable goods is that the observed large consumption
expenditure fluctuations of memorable goods does not necessarily lead to welfare losses from volatile
consumption. A household’s underlying utility flow from memorable goods can be much smoother
than the per-period memorable goods consumption expenditure because of the substitutability
between contemporaneous memorable goods consumption and the stock of memory accumulated in
the past. The optimal consumption of memorable goods for households depends on both the stock
of memory and the average level of recent past memorable goods consumption. Hence, households
adjust their memorable goods consumption over time based on their memory stock and the average
level of past memorable goods consumption. This is the case even in the absence of income risk
and incomplete financial markets.
To demonstrate the potential biases of measured welfare cost associated with consumption
fluctuations when the presence of memorable goods is not account for, we proceed in two steps.
First we conduct a reduced-form analysis of the welfare cost of consumption fluctuations whose
aim is to show that the bias due to incorrectly ascribing welfare losses to expenditure fluctuations
of memorable consumption can be substantial. Second, we use a structurally estimated version
of our consumption model developed in Section 2 to give a more precise answer, grounded in
economic theory, to the question of how much the welfare losses of consumption fluctuations might
be overstated by not accounting for the fact that memorable goods expenditure fluctuations are part
of optimal household consumption choices, even in the absence of uninsurable shocks (to income,
say) that may make consumption volatile otherwise.

4.1

Welfare Cost of Consumption Fluctuations: A Reduced Form Comparison

In this section, to carry out welfare analysis, we continue to assume that a typical household’s
flow utility function is given by equation (1) from Section 2. However, in this subsection we
do not specify the underlying source of the consumption fluctuations that lead to welfare losses,
relative to a smooth consumption profile. Instead, we directly take advantage of the empirically
observed consumption expenditure data to estimate statistical consumption processes, which we
then evaluate in terms of their welfare properties (relative to perfectly smooth profiles) using the
utility function in (1).
To do this, we need to assume a specific stochastic process for the observed consumption ex-

26

penditures. The advantage of this approach is that it does not rely on specific model frictions;
however, the disadvantage of this approach is that without observing the stock of memory and the
parameters that govern the evolution of the memory stock, we cannot calculate the welfare losses
associated with memorable goods expenditure fluctuations (if there are any). Nevertheless, this
approach can give us an upper bound on the possible bias in calculating welfare cost of consumption
fluctuations that one gets when failing to distinguish memorable goods from nondurable goods, of
course under the maintained assumption that the empirically estimated consumption expenditure
process is specified correctly.
In particular, suppose the empirical process for household h’s nondurable goods consumption
h at period (month) t is described as
expenditures Cn,t
h
ln (Cn,t
) =

X

αl dl + α13 · year + Xh,t β + σ c zth ,

l=2

zth ∼ N (0, 1)

(12)
(13)

where dl is a dummy variable for month l, the term α13 · year allows long-run yearly consumption
growth, and Xh,t is a vector of known individual characteristics of household h, including education,
marital status, race and sex of the reference person, family size, and regional dummies. The term
σ c measures the size of shocks to household consumption. Thus the process in (12) decomposes
monthly consumption expenditures into a predictable component P ht and a consumption shock
σ c zth .
To obtain an upper bound for the bias that is generated by ignoring the potential optimality of
memorable consumption fluctuations, we now assume that there are no welfare losses from fluctuations in memorable consumption expenditures. As demonstrated in Section 2, such fluctuations
are part of an optimal consumption plan, and we therefore implicitly assume that the empirically
observed fluctuations of expenditures on memorable goods are optimal.
Following Lucas (1987), we define the welfare cost of nondurable goods consumption fluctuations
as the percentage increase in consumption, uniform across all dates and states, required to leave
the consumer indifferent between the stochastic consumption process {(1 + g(σ c ))Cth } and the
deterministic process {E{Cth }} = exp(Pth + 21 σ 2c ). It can be shown that g(σ c ) is given by25

g(σ c ) ≈ γσ 2c .

where we recall that γ is the coefficient of relative risk aversion for nondurable consumption.

The proof of this is in appendix A.

Let σ 2N D be the variance of nondurable consumption obtained when estimating (12) with data
for nondurable consumption expenditures alone. Denote by σ N DM G as the estimated value from
h constituting the sum of expenditures on both nondurables and memorable
equation (12), with Cn,t

goods. Therefore, with σ N DM G corresponding to the measured volatility of nondurable goods
without distinction between nondurable and memorable consumption, this is just a special case of
our utility function (1) with ξ = 1.
The bias from misclassifying memorable goods predicted by this reduced-form welfare cost calculation thus depends on the relative magnitude of household-level residual consumption volatility
of nondurable and memorable goods (σ 2N DM G and σ 2N D ), and is directly proportional to the coefficient of relative risk aversion γ. The estimated average consumption volatility for the combined
(nondurable and memorable) consumption expenditures is σ̄ N DM G = 0.28, and is σ̄ N D = 0.25 for
nondurable consumption alone. The fact that σ̄ N DM G is three percentage points larger than σ̄ N D
comes from the fact that the average volatility of memorable goods expenditure is σ̄ M G = 1.01, significantly larger than σ̄ N D = 0.28, but that, on the other hand, the expenditure share of memorable
goods is only 16% of the combined expenditure, on average across households.26
The welfare cost of fluctuations in total consumption of memorable goods and nondurable goods
can be calculated using equation 14. Using the estimated average household consumption volatility
(0.28), the associated welfare cost of household-level consumption fluctuations is reported in Table
20. With logarithmic preferences the estimated welfare cost of consumption fluctuations is 3.95%
of total consumption of memorable and nondurable goods, and is 3.64% of total outlays. Evidently
this loss increases linearly with risk aversion γ as equation 14 implies.
In order to assess the extent to which the potential misclassification of memorable goods might
bias the calculations above, Table 21 reports the estimated welfare cost of household nondurable
consumption alone. Not surprisingly, given the reported volatile expenditure patterns of memorable
goods in Section 3.2, the estimate of σ̄ N D is lower than that of σ̄ N DM G . This difference has
significant consequences for the welfare cost of consumption fluctuations calculations. As shown in
Table 21 the welfare cost falls considerably. Again with logarithmic preferences they now amount
to 3.19% of nondurable goods consumption and only 2.49% of total outlays. Compared to the case
where the distinction between memorable goods and nondurable goods is ignored, the estimated
26

Note that the same argument we make here for memorable goods also applies to durable goods (although we are

obviously not the first ones to point it out for durable goods). Thus our quantitative conclusions are not necessarily
invalidated even if we mis-classify some durable goods as memorable goods in our analysis.

28

welfare cost is reduced by about 32% in terms of total outlays on account of the presence of
memorable goods. We stress again that we interpret this number as an upper bound on the bias in
the welfare cost calculations.27

4.2

Welfare Cost of Consumption Fluctuations: A Structural Approach

The previous section simply stipulated an empirical consumption process and used an empirical
estimate of consumption volatility, together with a utility function, to determine the welfare cost of
these consumption fluctuations. We did not take a stance on what underlying shocks might induce
these fluctuations and made rather stark assumptions about the degree to which they might be
optimal (not at all for nondurable consumption, perfectly optimal for memorable consumption).
In our structural model the only source of suboptimal consumption fluctuations stems from
uninsurable idiosyncratic labor income risk; recall that households could only self-insure through
building up and drawing down their balance of risk free assets.28 We now ask, in the context of
our structural model, how large are the welfare losses from consumption fluctuations induced by
idiosyncratic income shocks, and how these losses are affected by explicitly modeling memorable
goods. To do this, we compare (both in the model with, and in the model without memorable
goods) household welfare in two scenarios: one in which households in the model face a stochastic
income process and one in which households receive deterministic incomes with the same mean as
in the stochastic world. In order to implement these calculations we first have to parameterize our
structural model, which we do through a combination of calibration and structural estimation. We
describe this procedure next. We need a fully parameterized version of our model to carry out the
welfare cost of income shock-induced consumption fluctuations calculations, but we also view it
as informative to provide structural estimates especially of those preference parameters associated
with memorable goods consumption for which there is little evidence in the existing literature.
27

We also calculate the estimated volatility and welfare cost under a different categorization of consumption goods,

adopting a more conservative approach of what constitutes memorable goods. More concretely, we now group clothes
& shoes, and jewelry & watches into nondurable goods (as opposed to memorable goods) and call the resulting
aggregate “ND Plus”. The estimated consumption volatility is 0.27 and the associated welfare cost is displayed in
Table 22. With this classification the (upper bound for the) bias for the welfare cost of consumption fluctuations
amounts about 17% (the welfare cost falls from from 3.64 to 3.02 as a percent of total outlays).
28
In Lucas’ (1982) representative agent endowment economy household income and consumption fluctuations are
indistinguishable.

Calibrated Parameters

We first calibrate a subset of the parameters as follows. In line with the frequency of our CEX data
a model period is one month. We specify the monthly income process to be highly persistent29 and
set ρz = 0.9900. We set the standard deviation of the log income process to be σ  = 0.0797 so that
the covariance of current income and last year’s income matches CEX data.30 We normalize the
deterministic component of log income to ȳ = −0.1598 so that the unconditional expectation of an
individual’s monthly income is normalized to 1. We use an annual real interest rate of 4%, and thus
the monthly real interest rate in our model is set to be 0.33%. In our benchmark parameterization
we assume a log utility function, γ = 1. The parameter values from the outside sources are reported
in Table 3.
4.2.2

Estimation Results

The solution of the model serves as input to the estimation procedure. Estimation is by simulated
method of moments (SMM). Specifically, the average distance between five CEX data sample
moments and simulated model moments is minimized with respect to the five model parameters
(β, ξ, α, δ m , ρn ). Notice that the five parameters specify the preferences for and the law of motion
associated with memorable goods. The five moments we use consist of the (liquid) asset to income
ratio, the average expenditure share of ND out of total consumption expenditures (N D + M G),
and the average volatilities of ND, of memorable, and of total expenditures.
29

Our value implies an annual persistence of labor income of 0.89 which is at the lower end of the spectrum of the

empirical estimates. See e.g. Guvenen (2009). Note that, ceteris paribus, less persistent labor income shocks are
easier to insure through precautionary saving, and thus the welfare costs from these shocks are bound to be lower
that fluctuations with even higher persistence.

The estimated values of model parameters (β, ξ, α, δ m , ρ) are reported in Table 4. The estimated
relative importance of nondurable goods is fairly large, ξ = 0.7598, relative to the weight 1 − ξ =
0.2402 on memorable goods. Although immediate memorable consumption Cm constitutes the
most important component of the utility flow from memorable goods consumption (α = 0.8836),
the memory stock Mt is also significant. The weight of current memorable goods consumption on
future memory threshold N is moderate (ρ = 0.2881). Last, after one year 2/3 of the memorable
shock is depreciated, absent spending, and thus only 1/3 = (1 − .0861)12 remains. We also report
the values of targeted moments and the simulated moments under the parameter estimates31 in
Table 5.
31

Although the fit of the moments is satisfactory, it is not perfect, due to the inability of the model to generate,

jointly, sufficiently volatile nondurable consumption and sufficiently smooth memorable consumption expenditures
in the model, relative to the data. Note, however, that household consumption in the CEX is likely measured with
substantial error which might overstate the empirical expenditure volatility for a given household over a twelve month
interval.

Welfare Cost Calculation

Equipped with the structurally estimated model we now can calculate the welfare losses from
uninsurable income shocks, both in the presence and absence of memorable goods. Denoting by
Φ the normal cdf with zero mean and variance σ 2 , we can rewrite the household’s value function,

The outcome of this dynamic programming problem are value and policy functions V (M, N, S, z),

For each state (M, N, S), we define the welfare cost of consumption fluctuations induced by
uninsurable income shock as the permanent percent reduction in consumption that would make a
household living in a world without income risk indifferent to living in a world with income risk.
As Appendix A shows, that these numbers can be calculated from the value functions alone:

where V̄ (M, N, S; g) is lifetime utility in the no-risk economy with memorable goods, but with
nondurable and memorable consumption scaled up by a factor g at all future dates. The function
W̄ (S; g) has a similar interpretation.32
By construction, the welfare cost function g(M, N, S) in the model with memorable goods depends on the state variables M , N and S. Let F (M, N, S) denote the invariant marginal distribution
over state variables (M, N, S) in the model with memorable goods and income risk. Similarly, let
F W (S) denote the invariant marginal distribution over wealth in the model with income risk but
without memorable goods. Therefore,

Table 6 reports the estimated aggregate welfare cost measures ḡ and ḡ W from the structurally
estimated model. The reduction in the welfare cost of consumption fluctuations amounts to a
significant 1.7 percentage points, or to approximately 13% of the overall welfare cost in the absence
of memorable goods.
To further interpret this result, Figure 5 compares the welfare cost in the model with memorable
goods with the welfare cost in the model without memorable goods at each asset level (S) averaged
across states M and N . We observe that the magnitude of the welfare costs of consumption
fluctuations, is significantly smaller in the model with memorable goods than in the model without
memorable goods, at each asset level. Also note that the average asset level is lower in the model

34

with memorable goods, because the memorable goods stock is used as an alternative asset to smooth
adverse income shocks.33

5

Revisiting an Excess Sensitivity Test of Consumption

In the previous section we demonstrated that accounting for and explicitly modeling memorable
consumption goods may significantly change our quantitative assessment of the welfare cost of consumption fluctuations induced by uninsurable income shocks. Next we provide a second application
from the empirical consumption literature that is sensitive to the exclusion of memorable consumption. The standard consumption-savings model predicts that, absent borrowing constraints,
consumption should not respond to predictable changes in income. If it does, then consumption is
said to exhibit excess sensitivity (to predictable income changes).
Our goal here is not to rewrite the huge empirical literature on excess sensitivity of consumption.
We simply want to demonstrate that one important piece of evidence for excess sensitivity stemming from the consumption response to predictable federal income tax refunds, as documented
in the important paper by Souleles (1999), could be entirely due to the response of memorable
consumption expenditures to these tax refunds. In our empirical analysis we indeed find that nondurable consumption, not including memorable consumption expenditures, does not exhibit any
excess sensitivity with respect to predictable income tax refunds.

5.1

Implications of Model for Consumption Responses to Expected Income
Changes

The basic idea of consumption excess sensitivity tests is to investigate whether consumption expenditures respond to predictable changes in disposable income. According to the standard intertemporal consumption-savings model with rational expectation it should not, absent binding borrowing
33

In the presence of income risk and borrowing constraints, both the models with memorable goods and without

memorable goods have a non-degenerate invariant distribution over their respective state variables. In the model with
uninsurable income risk but without memorable goods, asset accumulation is the only option available for households
to smooth consumption and insure against income risk. However, in the model with memorable goods, under a
moderate depreciation rate (δ m = 0.0861), memorable goods serve as an alternative buffer to insure against income
shocks. When faced with negative income shocks households can access their internal capital market by delaying
expenditure spikes of memorable goods and letting the stock of memories depreciate. In the model with income
shocks but no memorable goods, the average savings rate is 11.88; in the model with income shocks and memorable
goods, the average savings rate is 11.13.

35

constraints.
The basic test for excess sensitivity of nondurable consumption to predictable income changes
can then be conducted by estimating the following specification:
Cn,t+1 − Cn,t = β 0 +

X

β 1,i Xi,t+1 + β 2 ∆Yt

(22)

i

where Xi,t+1 controls the change in household preferences and ∆Yt is a change of income between
period t and t + 1 that is predictable at time t. In Appendix A we show how this equation can
be derived from a linearization of the Euler equation for nondurable consumption expenditures.34
Thus, absent binding borrowing constraints, the standard consumption-savings model based on the
permanent income hypothesis implies that nondurable consumption changes should not be sensitive
to predictable income changes, or β 2 = 0.
However, for memorable goods consumption Cm,t , even in the absence of borrowing constraint,
expenditures on memorable goods Cm,t+1 may still respond to predictable income changes. To see
this, notice that since typically ∆Yt is correlated with Cm,t in our model35 , it does not predict that
β̃ 2 = 0 in the regression36 :
Cm,t+1 − Cm,t = β̃ 0 +

We now briefly discuss the data used to implement these two basic regressions before turning

Empirical Test Using CEX Tax-Refund Data
Data and Sample Selection

To insure comparability with Souleles (1999) our empirical strategy, as well as crucial sample
selection choices and variable definitions, follows his as much as possible. The data used in this
section are drawn from the CEX surveys from 1980 to 1991, which covers exactly the same time
period as in Souleles (1999). Our definition of nondurable and memorable goods is the same as in
previous sections. Furthermore we define strictly nondurable goods (Strictly ND) as all nondurable
goods, but excluding health, education and reading. Finally we define strictly memorable goods as
34
35

See Parker and Preston (2005) and Parker (1999) for similar analyses.
The same is true if ∆Yt is correlated with λm,t , the (transformed) Lagrange multiplier associated with law of

motion for memorable goods; see equation (35) in the appendix.
36
A linear approximation of the Euler equation for memorable consumption goods expenditure is derived in appendix A that displays the explicit form on which this regession equation is based.

36

memorable goods excluding clothes and jewelry. Thus our definition of nondurable and memorable
goods combined is equivalent to Souleles (1999)’s nondurable goods (ND+MG), and our definition
of strictly nondurable and strictly memorable goods combined equals to Souleles (1999)’s definition
of strictly nondurable goods (Strictly (ND+MG)).37
The sample was selected in a way that closely follows the selection criteria provided in Souleles
(1999).38 The CEX asks about tax refunds twice, in a household’s first and final interview. Each
time what is recorded is the value of federal tax refunds received by the households in the 12
months before the interview month. Thus the refund variable in the CEX has a reference period
of 12 months. About 80 percent of the refunds were mailed out in March, April and May during
the years 1980-1991,39 and thus following Souleles (1999), we deflate refunds by the average of
the monthly CPI for all items averaged over March, April, and May. All nominal variables were
deflated to 1982-1984 dollars.
5.2.2

Empirical Specification and Estimation

Souleles (1999) provides evidence for excess sensitivity in consumption by estimating two regressions, both of which we will revisit here. The first specification to be estimated is

ditures (in levels) between quarter I (January through March) and quarter II (April through June)
of a given year t. The variable yearht is the year dummy that is included to control for aggregate
shocks and interest rates across time. The variable refundht measures the tax refund received by
37

The major components of strictly nondurables, defined in Souleles (1999), are food; household operations, includ-

ing monthly utilities and small-scale rentals; apparel services and rentals; transportation fuel and services; personal
services; and entertainment services and high-frequency fees. We further break down the above consumption groups
into two consumption categories: strictly nondurable and strictly memorable goods by introducing memorable goods.
38
A household was dropped from the sample if there were multiple ‘consumer units’ in the household, or if the
household lived in student housing or the head of household was a farmer; a household quarter was dropped if the
household lacked basic food expenditure for any month of the quarter, or if any food was received as pay in the
quarter. A household quarter is dropped if the age of household head increased by more than one or decreased,
on moving into next quarter. The sample was further restricted to households with heads aged 24-64. Finally, a
household is dropped if the income report is incomplete or any of the income or financial records is invalid. We thank
Nicholas Souleles for sharing the data appendix of Souleles (1999).
39
Refer to Table 2 in Souleles (1999).

37

household h in year t. As discussed in Appendix A, with β 2 = 0 equation (24) can be derived
as a linearized version of the standard household consumption Euler equation; no linearization is
necessary if the period utility function is quadratic. The vector Xth contains demographic variables
(the age of the household head and changes in the number of adults and in the number of children)
and is included in the regression to control for basic changes in household preferences.
The refund variable in the CEX, refundht , has a reference period of 12 months. To make sure that
the refund reference period covers the consumption change period, that is, quarter I and quarter II
of year t, we further restrict the sample to households whose refund reference periods covers January
to June.40 Specifically, the interview month of the final interview is restricted to be either January
or July-December, so that the the key regressor refundht , which records the real value of refunds (in
levels) that household h received in the past 12 months before the final interview, covers the first
two quarters of year t (when about 90 percent of the refunds are received). This sample restriction
ensures that the regressor refundht is predetermined, and so under the basic consumption-savings
model based on the permanent income hypothesis β 2 should be zero.
An alternative to the standard frictionless intertemporal consumption model in which households might not display excess smoothness is a model proposed by Campbell and Mankiw (1990)
and adopted by Souleles (1999) in which households simply consume a fraction µ of their tax refunds, upon the receipt of the refund check. The number µ can then be interpreted as the marginal
propensity to consume (MPC) out of tax refunds. One could estimate µ by replacing β 2 ∗ refundht

in equation (24) with µ ∗ ∆refundht , where ∆refundht = refundht,II − refundht,I , the value of refunds

received in quarter II of year t minus the value of refunds received in quarter I of year t. The
CEX however, does not record refunds at quarterly frequency. Therefore following Souleles (1999),
we use the information on the distribution of aggregate refund disbursement to account for the
difference between refundht and ∆refundht .
Specifically, we calculate an ‘attenuation factor’ π from the distribution of aggregate refund
t,I
t,II t,I
disbursements: π ht = pt,II
h − ph , where ph (ph ) is the proportion of the refunds disbursed during

h’s refund reference period that was disbursed in particular in quarter I (quarter II) of year t.
Multiplying the regressor refundht by these factors to correct for the probability that some of refunds
40

Under this sample restriction, our final sample size is larger than that of Souleles (1999). This is because we

use monthly reference periods, whereas Souleles (1999) uses quarterly reference periods. For example, a consumption
record that covers from Dec. 1996 to Feb. 1997, is dropped from Souleles (1999) because it does not exactly cover
the calendar quarter I, whereas in our sample, we use 12 months consumption data to construct the consumption
record in quarter I and quarter II.

we use approximation ∆(refundht ) ≈ refundht ∗ π ht . The attenuation factors used in this paper are
taken directly from Souleles (1999) and are reported in Table 8. The equation for estimating the
MPC µ is then given by,

Results

Equation (24) is estimated by ordinary least squares (OLS), with the standard errors corrected
for heteroskedasticity. The estimation is undertaken including households that report no refund.
A statistically significant and positive coefficient β 2 then indicates, using the terminology of the
literature, that consumption is excessively sensitive to changes in after-tax incomes (due to the tax
rebates) that could have been anticipated by households. The results are reported in Table 7. As
a comparison, we also report the estimation results from Souleles (1999) for the same consumption
categories in Table 7.
Table 7 first displays the impact of federal income tax refunds on consumption categories for
which memorable goods and nondurable goods are not differentiated from each other. For consumption defined as the sum of strictly nondurable and memorable goods (corresponding to the
definition of strictly nondurable consumption used in Souleles (1999)), the coefficient of the refund
variable refundht is 0.023 and is statistically significant. However, once we exclude memorable goods
from this consumption measure, the excess sensitivity of nondurable consumption to tax refunds
becomes economically small and statistically insignificant: β 2 equals 0.007 and 0.001 for strictly
nondurable and nondurable consumption goods (but now excluding memorable goods), respectively. Furthermore, we find that the coefficient on the refund variable for memorable goods and
durable goods is both economically and statistically significant, 0.023 and 0.134 respectively. Thus
the excess sensitivity of strictly nondurable consumption expenditure found in Souleles (1999) can
entirely be attributed to the response of memorable consumption expenditure.
The OLS estimation results of equations (25) are reported in Table 8, with the standard errors
corrected for heteroskedasticity. We first report the estimated MPC for consumption categories that
do not differentiate between nondurable and memorable goods, but rather lump them together. We
then display results if memorable goods are treated as a separate consumption category. The MPC
of strictly nondurable consumption, including memorable goods, is positive and significant, as Soule-

goods, the MPC of both strictly nondurable and nondurable goods again becomes economically
modest and statistically insignificant (β 2 is estimated to equal 0.036 and 0.028 respectively). Moreover, as before memorable goods and durable goods display a large and significantly positive MPC
(0.081 and 0.467 respectively) out of the tax refunds.
To summarize, our results show that nondurable goods, memorable goods, and durable goods
may have very distinct responses to income tax refunds. After excluding memorable goods from the
traditionally defined nondurable goods category, nondurable goods consumption does not respond
to income tax refunds in an economically and statistically significantly way, whereas memorable
goods consumption responds to these refunds in a fairly sizeable way. Last, durable goods consumption display the most pronounced response.

Conclusion

In this paper we propose a novel consumption model that augments the canonical categorization of
consumption goods into nondurable and durable goods by a third category which we call memorable
goods. Memorable goods consumption impacts future utility through the accumulation process of
memory stock. We show that households optimally choose a non-smooth consumption profile of
memorable goods. We then estimate the welfare costs associated with consumption fluctuations,
and find that relative to the benchmark model, in which all nondurable consumption is lumped
together (and which is nested in our framework), an explicit distinction and modeling of memorable
goods reduces the estimated welfare costs by at least 10%, and possibly as much as 32%. We
furthermore argue that the rejection of the permanent income hypothesis (PIH) based on the excess
sensitivity of consumption to predictable income changes documented in important papers of the
literature might be entirely due to the presence of memorable goods. In addition to allocations,
the presence of memorable goods may have additional implications for asset prices, which we plan
to explore in future work.
Our consumer is an infinitely lived agent in a stationary world, modeled in this way to easily
compare her consumption behavior to that in the classical model. We believe the usefulness of
the memorable goods concept goes beyond the particular application in this paper, however. One
could use the memorable goods concept we introduce here to address other important applied
questions. For example, it is sometimes suggested that people undersave, as evidenced by a decline

42

in consumption when they are old. To the extent that early-life consumption includes memorable
goods, an approach that ignores memorable goods will overstate the drop in utility accompanying
decreased consumption later.
Finally, an important simplification in this paper is that all consumers are homogeneous; in
particular, the classification of goods as memorable goods is the same for all households and independent of income or wealth. It would be interesting to relax this homogeneity assumption and
investigate whether there are secular trends in the importance and categorization of memorable
goods and differences in the depreciation of memorable goods across households with different socioeconomic characteristics. Additionally, how the set of goods that are memorable changes across
an agent’s life cycle and how this set depends on her income, location, family composition and
other socioeconomic characteristics is an interesting question that future research could pursue.

where λSt+1 is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the borrowing constraint St+1 ≥ 0. Thus
the dynamics of nondurable consumption is affected by the presence of memorable goods only

through the impact of the latter on the binding patterns of the borrowing constraint. We will show
below that for households far away from the constraints, the nondurable consumption dynamics and
response to income shock are substantially identical to that of the standard consumption-savings
model41 , the same is not true for households with little or no financial wealth.
The optimal consumption choice for memorable goods consumption Cm depends strongly on the
current period stock of memories M and the average level of past memorable goods consumption
N . The first order condition for Cm,t is

To show that ∀C m ≥ 0, a consumption plan Cm,t = C m for all t is never optimal, it is sufficient
to prove that Cm,t = C m does not satisfy the optimality condition derived from the dynamic
programming problem.
First, notice that when ρ = 1,
∂V
∂V
(Mt , Nt , St , zt ) = −1Cm,t >Nt · βE
(Mt+1 , Nt+1 , St+1 , zt+1 ).

When there is no income uncertainty and no borrowing constraint, and (1+r)β = 1, the optimal
consumption profile must satisfies the following equation,

∂M
∂M

Because ρ = 1, under the smooth consumption plan Cm,t = C m for all t, Nt = C m for t ≥ 1.
Thus the optimality principle implies the following condition must be true for all t
−γ
ξCn,t
− α(1 − ξ)(αCm,t + (1 − α)Mt )−γ = 0.
41

And of course in the frictionless case when there is no income uncertainty and no borrowing constraint, and if

∗
(1 + r)β = 1, the household’s optimal consumption profile satisfies Cn,t
= C n for some C n > 0.

The Euler equation of Cn,t implies that Cn,t
= Cn,t+1
, therefore the above condition implies that

at optimum (αCm,t + (1 − α)Mt )−γ must be constant. However, under the smooth consumption
plan Cm,t = C m , Mt+1 = (1 − δ m )Mt < Mt . Thus a consumption plan Cm,t = C m , ∀C m ≥ 0, for
all t is never optimal.

the model with and without memorable goods, respectively) as the solution to
V̄ (M, N, S; g(M, N, S)) = V (M, N, S, z = 0)
W̄ (S; g W (S)) = W (S, z = 0)
where setting z = 0 in the model with risk again assures that households have the same income
today and same expected income from tomorrow on in both worlds. Solving for g(M, N, S) and
g W (S) gives, exploiting equations (28) and (29),

(32)
(33)

where en,t+1 and em,t+1 can be interpreted as the expectation error, and by construction en,t+1 and
em,t+1 are uncorrelated with information known at time t. Taking logs on both side and taking
a linear approximation43 of equation 32, we obtain the linearized Euler equation for nondurable
consumption:
Cn,t+1 − Cn,t =

1
[log((1 − ρ)β) + log(1 + λn,t ) − log(1 + en,t+1 ))].

(34)

Note that when the borrowing constraint is not binding at period t (λSt+1 = 0) λn,t = 0.
Doing the same with equation 33 yields
Cm,t+1 − Cm,t =

1−α
[log((1 − ρ)β) + log(1 + λm,t ) − log(1 + en,t+1 ))] −

Model Solution Algorithm

The model solution algorithm is as follows:
Step 1.

Guess an initial value of value function V (0) at each grid point of the state space, use

OLS regression to calculate the Smolyak coefficients associated with value function V (0) .
Step 2.

At each state space grid point, value function at the i-th iteration, V (i) , is maximized

by searching memorable goods consumption Cm over a discrete grid
V (i) (M, N, S, z) =
42
43

max

Cm ∈Grid of Cm

{W (i) (M, N, S, z, Cm )}

See Parker and Preston (2005) and Parker (1999) for similar analyses for nondurable goods expenditure.
The linear approximation used here is log yt+1 − log yt = (yt+1 − yt )/ȳ for some ȳ.

The solution of optimal savings S 0 ∗ associated with memorable goods consumption Cm is characterized by the following equation
−

∂S 0

≤ 0.

For (M 0 , N 0 , S 0 , z 0 ) outside the state space grid, the value of value function V (i−1) (M 0 , N 0 , S 0 , z 0 )

is calculated via interpolation using Smolyak coefficients. Furthermore, E[V (i−1) (M 0 , N 0 , S 0 ∗ , z 0 )|z]
is calculated using quadratic rule numerical integration method.
Step 3. Update Smolyak coefficients associated with value function V (i) .
Step 4.

Repeat Step 2 to 3 until the value of value function at each state space grid point and

associated Smolyak coefficients converge.

C

Stationary Distribution

Our model predicts that there is a cross-sectional stationary distribution of state variables. There
is no analytical solution to the household’s consumption-savings problem, so we characterize the
cross-sectional distribution of (Mt , Nt , St , zt ) numerically using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
simulation method. Specifically our procedure is as follows:
Step 1: At period t = 0, we randomly simulate state variables (M0 , N0 , S0 ) for each household h ∈
{1, . . . , H} from an arbitrary initial distribution F (0) (M, N, S), and draw z0 from the distribution
N (0, σ 2 /(1 − ρ2 )) for each household.
Step 2: At period t = 0, for given state variables (Mt , Nt , St , zt ), households optimally make their
∗
∗ . Households’
current memorable goods consumption Cm,t
and period t + 1 savings decisions St+1
∗
∗
period t + 1 state variables Mt+1
and Nt+1
are updated according to Equations 2 and 3 respec-

tively. Households’ period t + 1 income shock zt+1 is randomly drawn according to the conditional
∗ , M ∗ , M ∗ ) for H households yield
distribution N (ρz zt , σ 2 ). The updated state variables (Mt+1
t+1
t+1

the numerical distribution F (1) (M, N, S).

53

Step 3:

Check if whether distribution F (1) (M, N, S) converges to F (0) (M, N, S) by checking

whether the mean and variance of the state variable M, N, S are the same under these two distributions. If the distribution is not converged, then repeat step 2 for t = 2, . . ..

Data
Income Categories

We define disposable income as income before tax minus reported federal, state and local income
taxes payments, property tax not reported elsewhere and other tax (net of tax refunds), deductions
for social security and pension plans. Household income before tax includes wages and salaries, net
business income, net farm income, rents income, dividend income, interest income, pension income,
social security and railroad retirement income, supplemental security income, unemployment compensation, workers’ compensation and veterans benefits, welfare received, scholarship, food stamps,
contributions received from others with alimony/child support, meals received as pay, rent received
as pay, and lump sum receipts and lump sum child support payment.

This is based on the EXPN variable QTRADEX in the OVB file which is the “Amount paid for vehicle after

trade-in allowance minus amount of cost paid by employer”. It includes loans taken out. It represents the total final
cost to the consumer of buying the car not just the down payment they make when purchasing the vehicle. In this
case, it essentially means the total amount committed to new and used motor vehicles by the consumer not just the
immediate out of pocket expenditure.

that an expenditure is a spike if the expenditure exceeds the household-level average.
Average inactivity records the fraction of households who did not incur any expenditure
during the 12-month reference period. The average frequency of consumption spikes is
the average number of consumption expenditure spikes divided by 12. The relative size
