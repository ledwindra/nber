    "abstract": "\n\nI develop and implement a methodology for cohort life expectancy using a panel of administrative tax data on a large sample born between 1930 and 1964. Over these 35 years, cohort life expectancy after age 54 grew by 5 years for women and 7 years for men. The income-longevity gradient for the top vs. bottom five percent of incomes is 9 years of post-54 life for men and 7 years for women. The life expectancy improvements arise across the income distribution in Canada, unlike the United States. Large differences across neighbourhoods emerge which cannot be explained by income differences alone.\n\n",
