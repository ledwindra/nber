    "abstract": "\n\nHistorical accounts suggest that Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9s from Nazi Germany revolutionized U.S. science. To analyze the \u00e9migr\u00e9s' effects on chemical innovation in the U.S. we compare changes in patenting by U.S. inventors in research fields of \u00e9migr\u00e9s with fields of other German chemists. Patenting by U.S. inventors increased by 31 percent in \u00e9migr\u00e9 fields. Regressions that instrument for \u00e9migr\u00e9 fields with pre-1933 fields of dismissed German chemists confirm a substantial increase in U.S. invention. Inventor-level data indicate that \u00e9migr\u00e9s encouraged innovation by attracting new researchers to their fields, rather than by increasing the productivity of incumbent inventors.\n\n",
