ABSTRACT
Many countries provide financial incentives to spur innovation, ranging from tax incentives to
research and development grants. In this paper, we study how such financial incentives affect
individuals' decisions to pursue careers in innovation. We first present empirical evidence on
inventors' career trajectories and income distributions using de-identified data on 1.2 million
inventors from patent records linked to tax records in the U.S. We find that the private returns to
innovation are extremely skewed – with the top 1% of inventors collecting more than 22% of
total inventors' income – and are highly correlated with their social impact, as measured by
citations. Inventors tend to have their most impactful innovations around age 40 and their
incomes rise rapidly just before they have high-impact patents. We then build a stylized model of
inventor career choice that matches these facts as well as recent evidence that childhood exposure
to innovation plays a critical role in determining whether individuals become inventors. The
model predicts that financial incentives, such as top income tax reductions, have limited potential
to increase aggregate innovation because they only affect individuals who are exposed to
innovation and have no impact on the decisions of star inventors, who matter most for aggregate
innovation. Importantly, these results hold regardless of whether the private returns to innovation
are known at the time of career choice. In contrast, increasing exposure to innovation (e.g.,
through mentorship programs) could have substantial impacts on innovation by drawing
individuals who produce high-impact inventions into the innovation pipeline. Although we do not
present direct evidence supporting these model-based predictions, our results call for a more
careful assessment of the impacts of financial incentives and a greater focus on alternative
policies to increase the supply of inventors.

Introduction

The importance of innovation for economic growth (e.g., Romer 1990, Aghion and Howitt 1992) has
led to considerable policy interest in increasing rates of innovation. The most common approach to
spur innovation is to provide financial incentives to innovate, such as tax reductions or research and
development (R&D) grants. Although a large body of research has evaluated the impacts of such
financial incentives on behavior in firms (e.g., Hall and Rosenberg 2010), there has been less work
on how financial incentives affect whether individuals choose to become inventors – the “supply” of
inventors in the terminology of Romer (2000).
In this paper, we study how financial incentives affect individuals’ decisions to pursue careers
in innovation, in two steps. We first document a set of facts about inventors’ careers in the labor
market that shed light on the structure of returns to innovation. We then construct a stylized model
of career choice that matches these facts as well as other recent evidence to analyze how financial
incentives affect the supply of inventors.
In the first part of the paper, we analyze inventors’ careers using a longitudinal dataset covering
1.2 million inventors in the United States.1 This dataset was constructed by Bell et al. (2019) by
linking the universe of patent applications and grants in the U.S. between 1996 and 2014 to federal
income tax returns. These administrative data allow us to track inventors’ incomes and patent rates
from the beginning to the end of their careers in a comprehensive manner.
We find that the financial returns to innovation are highly skewed and highly correlated with
their scientific impact – two key facts which we show using our model imply that small changes
in financial incentives will not affect aggregate innovation significantly. The highest-paid 1% of
inventors (whose annual incomes exceed $1.6 million per year) earn more than 22% of total inventors’
income. The distribution of income among patent-holders is as skewed as the distribution of income
in the population as a whole. Individuals with highly cited patents have much higher incomes,
suggesting that the private benefits of innovation are correlated with their social returns.2
Next, we turn to the dynamics of inventors’ careers. We find that inventors tend to make their
highest-impact (most cited) discoveries when they are in their mid-forties, well after they make
initial career choices, consistent with the findings of Jones et al. (2014). Interestingly, inventors’
1

Following prior work, we define an “inventor” as an individual who holds a patent. Patents provide a useful proxy
for innovation at scale, but have well-known limitations (e.g., Griliches 1990 and OECD 2009).
2
We follow prior work (e.g., Jaffe et al. 1993) in using patent citations as a proxy for a patent’s technological merit
and social impact. Although citations are an imperfect proxy for impact, they are well correlated with other measures
of value, such as firm’s profits and market valuations (Scherer et al. 2000, Hall et al. 2005, Abrams et al. 2013, Kogan
et al. 2017).

1

incomes tend to rise rapidly in the years just before patents are granted, consistent with Depalo and
Di Addario (2014). This result implies that much of the individual return to innovation comes not
from the patent itself – the component of inventors’ income that has received the most attention
in prior work (e.g., Van Reenen 1996, Kline et al. 2017) – but from associated business income and
salaries.
In the second part of the paper, we characterize the implications of our empirical findings
for policies to increase innovation using a simple model of career choice. We build a model that
matches both the facts on career trajectories described above and evidence from our companion
paper (Bell et al. 2019) on the importance of childhood exposure to innovation. In that paper –
which complements the present study by analyzing inventors’ lives before entering the labor market –
we showed that exposure to innovation during childhood has significant causal effects on children’s
propensities to invent. In particular, children whose families move to a high-innovation area at
young ages are more likely to become inventors. These impacts are technology-class and gender
specific. Children who grow up in a neighborhood or family with a high innovation rate in a specific
technology class are more likely to patent in exactly the same class. Girls are more likely to invent
in a particular class if they grow up in an area with more women (but not men) who invent in that
class. Since these gender- and technology class-specific impacts are unlikely to be driven by factors
that affect general human capital accumulation (such as the quality of schools), we conclude that
they must be driven by more narrow exposure effects – i.e., information or role model effects that
motivate some children to pursue innovation.
Motivated by these findings, we construct a model in which three factors determine whether
an individual pursues innovation: financial incentives, exposure to innovation, and preferences.
We model exposure as a stochastic binary variable: individuals who do not receive exposure to
innovation do not consider an inventor career, whereas those who receive exposure decide whether
to pursue innovation by maximizing expected lifetime utility as in Roy (1951) and Hsieh et al.
(2016). To match our empirical findings on the return to innovation, we model payoffs in the
innovation sector using a Pareto distribution, focusing on the case where the skewness of the payoffs
is large, either due to differences in ex-ante abilities to innovate or ex-post shocks. We also assume
that inventors’ salaries are proportional to social impact of their inventions given our result that
citations and salaries are strongly correlated. Finally, we assume that exposure to innovation is
uncorrelated with individuals’ abilities to innovate – an assumption that is consistent with evidence
on heterogeneity across subgroups from Bell et al. (2019).

2

Using this model, we compare the impacts of two types of policies on innovation: increasing private financial returns (e.g., by cutting top income tax rates) and increasing exposure (e.g., through
mentorship programs). The model implies that the potential to increase innovation by reducing
top taxes is limited, for three reasons. First, such policies only affect the subset of individuals
who have been exposed to the possibility of an inventor career. Second, if the returns to innovation are forecastable at the point of career choice, such policies would only induce inventors of
marginal quality to enter the field rather than star inventors. In our data, the mean annual income
of those with patents in the top 1% of the citation distribution is more than $1 million between
ages 40-50. The decisions of these star inventors are unlikely to be affected by small changes in
financial incentives, making aggregate quality-weighted innovation relatively insensitive to tax rates
(Jaimovich and Rebelo 2017).3 Third, if the returns to innovation are uncertain at the point of
career choice, the elasticity of innovation with respect to top income tax rates is likely to be small
in a standard expected utility model because tax changes only affect payouts when inventors have
very high incomes and low marginal utility.
In contrast, the model implies that increasing exposure can have substantial impacts on qualityweighted innovation by drawing individuals who would produce high-impact inventions (“Lost Einsteins” or “Lost Marie Curies”) into the innovation pipeline.4 Since exposure to innovation is
uncorrelated with individuals’ abilities to innovate, policies that increase exposure increase aggregate quality-weighted innovation in direct proportion to their impact on the number of inventors.
This ability to attract more star inventors avoids the diminishing returns that set in from running
down the quality ladder of inventions when providing greater financial incentives.
It is important to keep several caveats in mind when interpreting the preceding conclusions.
First, the policy impacts described above are theoretical predictions from a stylized model that
matches certain empirical findings, but also rests on additional assumptions that are conventional
but untested (e.g., expected utility maximization). We believe that these theoretical predictions
are useful because directly identifying the impacts of taxation or other policies on career choice is
3

Jaimovich and Rebelo (2017) establish a similar result in a neoclassical model of career choice with heterogeneous
abilities. Our results are consistent with theirs and make three further contributions. First, in the setting with
heterogeneous abilities that they consider, we derive a formula that can be directly calibrated using the parameters
and relationships we estimate empirically, namely the degree of skewness of the income distribution of inventors and
the linear relationship between the social returns to innovation (as measured by citations) and inventors’ incomes.
Second, we also analyze the case where returns are not known at the point of career choice. Finally, we introduce
exposure effects into the model.
4
Of course, one cannot conclude that aggregate welfare would be higher if these individuals were to enter innovation
rather than the careers they currently pursue, as those careers may be socially valuable as well. Our point here is
simply that if one takes the goal of increasing innovation as given, increasing exposure could be effective in achieving
that goal.

very challenging. Indeed, even state-of-the-art quasi-experimental studies (e.g., Akcigit et al. 2018)
identify short-run responses to financial incentives rather than long-term impacts on career choice.
Nevertheless, we caution that further work is needed to gauge the empirical relevance of our results.
Second, our analysis focuses exclusively on the decisions of individual inventors. Taxes and other
financial incentives could potentially affect innovation through many different channels, for instance
by changing the behavior of firms, other salaried workers who contribute to the innovation process,
or through general equilibrium effects (e.g., Lerner and Wulf 2007, Akcigit et al. 2017). Taxes may
also influence inventors’ behavior on other margins, such as how much effort to supply or where to
locate (Akcigit et al. 2016, Moretti and Wilson 2017), which are distinct from the extensive margin
career choice decisions we focus on here.
Finally, our analysis does not provide guidance on specific policies to increase exposure to innovation. The fact that some neighborhoods in America induce many more children to become
inventors suggests that it is feasible to design childhood environments that could significantly increase aggregate innovation (Bell et al. 2019). How exactly one can replicate the impacts of such
environments in a cost-effective manner is a key question that we leave to future work.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses how our results contribute to the prior literature. Section III presents empirical results on inventors’ career trajectories.
Section IV presents the model and comparative static results on the impacts of policy changes. Section V concludes.

Related Literature

This paper contributes to the literature on financial incentives and innovation in two ways. First,
most previous work studies incentives to innovate within firms, while we focus on the career choices
of individuals. Second, prior work has focused primarily on “demand-side” policies such as tax
credits for research and development, in contrast with our focus on “supply-side” policies that
attempt to directly increase the number of inventors.
Firm-level vs. inventor-level studies. Most empirical work on innovation has focused on firms
(Griliches 1984, Hall and Rosenberg 2010), examining how innovation responds to the Intellectual
Property (IP) regime or to incentives for R&D. Most studies have found that incentives for R&D
have significant effects on innovation and R&D expenditures (see Becker (2015) for a survey). For
example, Dechezlepretre et al. (2016) and Chen et al. (2018)) show significant impacts of changes
in national tax rules, while Bloom et al. (2013) and Wilson (2009) find substantial effects of state4

specific R&D tax credits. Similarly, studies of direct R&D subsidies also find positive impacts on
innovation, especially for smaller firms (e.g., Howell 2017).
This focus on firms may be warranted because R&D and patenting are mainly conducted by
firms, rather than by individual inventors (Mowery and Rosenberg 1991). However, important
early-stage innovation sometimes still occurs outside corporations, such as the “garage” innovators
responsible for many of the technological giants of today, such as Apple, Facebook, Google, and
Microsoft. Moreover, it is ultimately individuals who choose whether or not to pursue careers in
innovation and join firms in the innovation sector. For these reasons, it is also valuable to study
the potential impacts of policies on individuals’ decisions.
There has been considerable theoretical work analyzing the role of individual inventors. Indeed,
most macroeconomic models of endogenous growth typically allow individuals to choose whether to
join an R&D sector or production sector (e.g., Romer 1990, Aghion and Howitt 1992, Jaimovich and
Rebelo 2017). In addition, much theoretical work analyzes optimal contracts between individuals
and CEOs, owner, and financiers (e.g., Pakes and Nitzan 1983, Aghion and Tirole 1994, Manso
2011, Ederer and Manso 2013).
However, there has been much less empirical work focusing on the behavior of individual inventors because of a lack of longitudinal data that allows researchers to follow individual inventors over
time. In a classic study, Schmookler (1957) obtained patent data and studied the background of
57 American inventors. This line of careful biographical work using patent data has been followed
up by various papers, perhaps most ambitiously in the PATVAL database covering 9,017 European
patents (Giuri et al. 2007). Li et al. (2014) made an important step forward in this line of research
by disambiguating names of inventors in order to track individuals with multiple patents over time.
Although the approach of linking together information from patent records has led to valuable
research, it has important limitations. First, there is little or no biographical information on inventors (e.g., age or gender) or their backgrounds. Second, there is no capacity to track inventors’
incomes or other outcomes beyond patenting. In the last few years, administrative data have enabled researchers to overcome these challenges by matching patent records to other datasets with
much richer biographical information. Much of this research has been conducted using data from
Scandinavian registries (e.g., Toivanen and Vaananen 2012, Lindquist et al. 2015, Jung and Ejermo
2014, Aghion et al. 2017), while other work uses Census data and tax data from the United States
(Akcigit et al. 2017, Bell et al. 2019). These studies are beginning to yield a richer understanding
of the factors that affect who becomes an inventor, ranging from IQ and parental education (e.g.,

5

Aghion et al. 2017) to childhood exposure (Bell et al. 2019) and the impacts of taxation and other
policy changes (Akcigit et al. 2017, Akcigit et al. 2018).
Our empirical analysis contributes to this nascent literature by analyzing the dynamics of inventors’ careers in the labor market in the United States. While some studies have presented evidence
on the returns to innovation in other countries (Toivanen and Vaananen 2012, Depalo and Di Addario 2014), there is little contemporary information on the returns to innovation in the United
States. Our empirical estimates – along with additional statistics on inventors’ income distributions
by year and citations that we report in our Online Data Tables – are useful in calibrating models
of innovation, yielding new insights into the effects of financial incentives on inventors’ behavior.
Demand-side vs. supply-side policies. Romer (2000) observes that most existing policies to
increase innovation focus on the “demand” side, shifting the demand curve for innovation outward by
subsidizing research and development. Romer notes that if the number of workers in the innovation
sector (“supply”) is fixed, then increasing demand for their skills may simply drive up their wages
with no effect on the quantity of innovation, consistent with the empirical findings of Goolsbee
(1998).
Given the potential limitations of demand-side policies, Romer (2000) calls for greater focus
on increasing the supply of inventors directly, e.g. by increasing the number of STEM graduates
(Freeman and Van Reenen 2009). Our study contributes to this agenda by directly analyzing what
policies can increase the supply of inventors. Importantly, we analyze impacts not just on the
total quantity of inventors but also the quality of those inventors – a feature that is critical for
our conclusion that increasing childhood exposure to innovation may have larger impacts on the
aggregate (quality-weighted) supply of inventors than changes in financial incentives.

III

Evidence on Inventors’ Career Trajectories

In this section, we present a set of empirical results on inventors’ career trajectories. We begin by
briefly describing the data we use for this analysis and then turn to the results.

III.A

Data

Sample Construction. We link data on the universe of patent applications and grants in the U.S.
between 1996 and 2014 to federal income tax returns to construct a de-identified panel dataset
of inventors, whom we define as patent applicants or recipients. This dataset is the same as that
constructed in Bell et al. (2019), and we therefore refer readers to Section II of that paper for details

6

regarding our data sources and sample construction.
Our analysis sample in this paper consists of all inventors who were successfully linked to the
tax data, the “Full Inventors Sample” in Bell et al. (2019). 88% of individuals who applied for
or were granted a patent were successfully linked to the tax data, yielding an analysis sample of
approximately 1.2 million individuals. The sample is structured as a panel from 1996 to 2012, with
data in each year on individual’s incomes, patents, and other variables.
Income Definitions. We measure income as total individual income, which includes wage earnings as well as self-employment income and capital income.5 For tax filers, total income is defined
as Adjusted Gross Income (as reported on the 1040 tax return) plus tax-exempt interest income
and the non-taxable portion of Social Security and Disability benefits minus the spouse’s W-2 wage
earnings (for married filers). For non-filers, total income is defined simply as wage earnings as
reported on form W-2. Individuals who do not file a tax return and who have no W-2 forms are
assigned an income of zero.6 Because the tax data does not record W-2 income prior to 1999, we
cannot reliably measure individual earnings prior to that year, and therefore measure individuals’
incomes only starting in 1999. Income is measured prior to the deduction of individual income taxes
and employee-level payroll taxes in 2012 dollars, adjusting for inflation using the consumer price
index (CPI-U).
Summary Statistics. Table I presents descriptive statistics for our analysis sample. The median
number of patent applications between 1996-2012 is 1 and the median number of citations per
inventor is also only 1. But these distributions are very skewed: the standard deviations of the
number of patent applications and citations are 11.1 and 118.1, respectively. The mean age of
inventors is 44 and 13% of inventors in the sample are women.

III.B

Empirical Results

We now use these data to examine inventors’ career paths and outcomes after they enter labor
market. We establish four facts on the income distributions of inventors that are both of interest in
their own right and shed light on the effects of financial incentives on innovation when interpreted
using a standard model of career choice.
Fact 1: Returns to Innovation are Highly Skewed. We begin by characterizing the cross-sectional
distribution of inventors’ permanent incomes. We measure inventors’ permanent incomes by com5

Wage earnings comprise 95% of total income for the average inventor (conditional on having total income above
$1,000).
6
Importantly, these observations are true zeros rather than missing data. Because the database covers all tax
records, we know that these individuals have no taxable income.

7

puting their average annual incomes between the ages of 40 and 50. Since our data on individual
incomes begin in 1999 and end in 2012, we focus on individuals in our analysis sample who are born
between 1959 and 1962, for whom we see income at all ages between 40 and 50. These individuals
applied for or were granted patents between ages 34 and 53, as our patent data span 1996-2012.
The income distribution of inventors, plotted in Figure Ia, is extremely skewed. The median
annual income between ages 40-50 (in 2012 dollars) is $114,000, the mean is $192,000, and the 99th
percentile is $1.6 million. 22% of total income earned by inventors accrues to individuals in the top
1% of the inventors’ income distribution, a top income share that is similar to the 23% top income
share in the mid-2000s in the population as a whole (Atkinson et al. 2011). The degree of inequality
among inventors is similar to that in the general population. In contrast, most other high-skilled
professions, such as medicine or law, have much more homogeneous income distributions; one of the
only other professions with comparable heterogeneity in income is the financial sector (Lockwood
et al. 2017). Innovation thus differs from many other high-skilled occupations in that a small group
of individuals obtain a large fraction of the returns.
Fact 2: Private Returns are Highly Correlated with Social Returns. Inventor’s incomes reflect
the private returns to innovation, which may differ from social returns. Prior work has used the
future citations to a patent as a measure of its scientific impact and social value (e.g., Jaffe et al.
1993). Figure Ib shows that the private returns to patents are highly correlated with their scientific
impact, as measured by citations. It presents a binned scatter plot of average annual income between
ages 40-50 vs. the total number of citations an inventor obtains. We restrict the sample to patent
applications in 1996 in this figure to maximize the time horizon over which we can measure future
citations. The figure is constructed by dividing citations into 21 bins and plotting mean income
vs. mean citations within each bin. The first 19 bins include inventors in the first 19 ventiles (5%
bins) of the citations distribution, while the last two bins plot the same relation for the 95th to
98th percentiles and the 99th percentile of the citation distribution. There is a strong positive
relationship between citations and income. Notably, inventors who have patents in the top 1%
of the citation distribution earn more than $1 million per year between ages 40 and 50, showing
that individuals with highly impactful innovations from a scientific perspective obtain large private
returns over their lifetimes.
Having characterized the cross-sectional distribution of inventors’ incomes, we now turn to the
dynamics of innovation and income over inventors’ careers.
Fact 3: Innovation Rates Peak in Mid-Career. Figure IIa plots the cross-sectional age distri-

8

bution of individuals who filed a patent application in 2000 that was subsequently granted. The
modal age of patenting is 38, with symmetric declines at younger and older ages, consistent with
Jones et al. (2014). This pattern is partly driven by the fact that the fraction of people who work
falls at older ages. Figure IIb plots the fraction of workers in the population (individuals with
positive W-2 earnings) who patent in 2000 by age. Innovation per worker still peaks around 40,
but falls more gradually at older ages, with a 33% decline from age 40 to 60. Figure IIc plots the
fraction of workers whose patents went on to become highly-cited (in the top 5% of patents filed
in 2000) by age. The rate of high-impact innovation falls by 66% from age 40 to 60. This result
is broadly consistent with Acemoglu et al.’s (2014) hypothesis that the “young and restless” have
higher impact discoveries, although individuals’ most impactful innovations tend to come in the
middle rather than at the beginning of their professional careers.
Fact 4: Most Returns are Accrued Before Patents are Granted. Finally, we examine the dynamics
of income over inventors’ careers. Figure IIIa plots the median income of individuals who apply
for a patent at age 30, 40, or 50. In each case, we see a steep increase in income in the years
immediately preceding the patent application, following by a leveling off or decline. Figure IIIb
generalizes this analysis using an event study framework, defining year 0 as the year in which an
individual files a patent application and other years relative to this reference year (e.g., +1 is the
year after the application).7 Consistent with the findings in Figure IIIa, median and mean incomes
rise sharply and peak at the point of patent application, similar to Depalo and Di Addario’s (2014)
findings in Italian data. We also find a similar trajectory in the upper tail: the 99th percentile of the
distribution peaks at $1.8 million shortly after the year of application and falls slightly thereafter.
Figure IIIc presents event studies of median income for three groups: unsuccessful applications
(patents that were not granted before 2014), all granted patents, and highly-cited patents (those in
the top 5% of the citation distribution among all patents granted in the same year). As noted above,
individuals with highly-cited patents have higher incomes, and much of that higher income again
comes from a much steeper earnings trajectory in the years prior to the point of patent application.
The results in Figure III suggest that a patent application marks the peak of a successful career in
innovation rather than an event that itself produces high returns, perhaps because the patent event
itself is not news to the firm or the market. Indeed, patent royalties account for less than 3% of
income even for inventors with highly cited patents five years after a patent is granted.8
7

We limit the sample to individuals who file patent applications between ages 35 and 50. For individuals who file
multiple patents in this age window, we choose one of the patents at random.
8
Of course, some very high value patents may have significant causal impacts on the wages of an inventor and her

9

In summary, the private returns to innovation are highly skewed and correlated with their
scientific impact. In addition, returns may be uncertain at the time of career choice, as the most
impactful inventions tend to occur around age 40, and incomes tend to rise rapidly only shortly
before that point. In the next section, we show that these facts imply that changes in financial
incentives are unlikely to have large effects on rates of innovation in standard models of career
choice.

IV

A Model of Inventors’ Careers

In this section, we develop a model of inventor career choice that broadly matches the empirical
findings above as well as the evidence on the importance of childhood exposure effects in determining
whether individuals pursue a career in innovation from Bell et al. (2019). Our model builds on recent
models of innovation and career choice (e.g. Hsieh et al. 2016, Jaimovich and Rebelo 2017) in two
ways. First, we introduce a role for exposure, whereby some people do not consider a career in
innovation irrespective of incentives, e.g., because of a lack of awareness. Second, we allow for the
possibility that the returns to innovation may be partly uncertain to the individual at the point of
career choice in light of our findings above on the earnings trajectories of inventors.
We first describe the setup of the model and then present comparative static results on the
effects of changes in financial incentives and exposure to innovation. Derivations and proofs are
given in the Appendix.

With this specification, changes in the shape parameters βπ and βα affect the skewness of payoffs
while leaving the mean return E[ri ] unchanged. The skewness of the payoffs is decreasing in the
shape parameters; when the shape parameters approach one, the distribution of payoffs becomes
infinitely skewed. We assume that wages and returns to innovation are fixed, and in particular do
not respond to the number of individuals who enter each sector.
Individuals must pay a tax τ on their incomes in the innovation sector, resulting in a net-of-tax
payoff to innovation of (1 − τ )ri .10 This tax τ can equivalently be interpreted as a cost of entering
innovation, as in Hsieh et al. (2016).11
Exposure. Individuals’ decisions are influenced by whether they are exposed to innovation. We
model exposure as a binary variable λi that follows a Bernoulli distribution λi ∼ B(λ). Individuals
who do not receive exposure to innovation (λi = 0) never pursue innovation, while those who receive
exposure (λi = 1) choose their sector by maximizing expected lifetime utility.
Importantly, we assume that the probability of exposure to innovation is uncorrelated with
individuals’ abilities to innovate. This assumption is motivated by evidence from Bell et al. (2019)
that individuals who are less exposed to innovation – e.g., women, minorities, and children from
low-income families – do not appear to have different latent abilities to innovate, as measured for
instance by their math test scores early in childhood.
Preferences. To obtain closed-form solutions, we assume that agents have constant relative risk
aversion (CRRA) utility functions, although all of the qualitative results that follow hold with any
smooth and concave utility function. Let u(ci ) =

Agent Behavior

inventor’s ability which is revealed ex-post (after choosing an inventor career) and could not be anticipated ex-ante
(before career choice).
10
We assume that the tax applies only to the innovation sector as a simple way to capture the fact that top income
tax rates may affect the payoffs to innovation (which can sometimes be very high) more than payoffs to other careers
that have lower (fixed) salaries. Insofar as taxes also affect payoffs in other sectors, career choices will be less sensitive
to tax rates, reinforcing our results below.
11
In Hsieh et al.’s model, the barriers to entry τ vary across subgroups (e.g., women and minorities effectively face
higher tax rates). Our model can be interpreted as applying to one such subgroup; the comparative static results
below show how differences in τ affect innovation rates across subgroups.

11

Working in the innovation sector yields expected utility ViI = Eπ [u (ri · (1 − τi ))]. Agent i there¯

fore enters the innovation sector if λi ViI > ViI = u(wI¯). It is straightforward to show that agents
follow a threshold rule when deciding whether to enter innovation: there is an ability threshold ᾱ
such that all agents with innovation-specific ability αi > ᾱ enter the innovation sector. Taking into
account exposure effects, the share of agents who become inventors is therefore

φ = λ · (1 − Fa (ᾱ)).

(1)

We show in the appendix that under our functional form assumptions, we can obtain a closed-form
expression for the share of inventors:

φ = κφ · λ(1 − τ )βα ,

define aggregate quality-weighted innovation as
Φ = φE[ν · ri |αi > ᾱ].

Intuitively, aggregate innovation depends upon the number of inventors (φ) and the average quality
of their innovations. Again, we can obtain a closed-form expression for aggregate innovation:

IV.C

Effects of Changes in Financial Payoffs

The following proposition characterizes the impact of reducing the tax rate τ (which can be interpreted as an increase in the financial return to innovation or as a reduction in barriers to entry) on
innovation.
Proposition 1.

Reducing the tax rate (τ ) increases the fraction of inventors (φ) and aggregate

innovation (Φ).
12

The magnitude of the response is characterized by three properties:
1. [ Exposure dampening] The absolute impact of changes in τ on φ and on Φ are proportional
to exposure λ.
2. [ Forecastable returns] When returns to innovation vary purely because of heterogeneity in
ability known at time of career choice (βπ → ∞), the elasticities of φ and Φ with respect to (1 − τ )
converge to φ,(1−τ ) → βα and Φ,(1−τ ) → βα −1. As the skewness of the ability distribution increases
(βa → 1), the elasticity of Φ with respect to (1 − τ ) converges to zero.
3. [Stochastic returns] As the skewness of stochastic returns to innovation increases (βπ → 1),
at a given initial level of innovation φ0 , the elasticities of φ and Φ with respect to (1 − τ ) both
converge to zero if θ > 0: φ,(1−τ ) → 0 and Φ,(1−τ ) → 0.
The first result in Proposition 1 (exposure dampening) implies that the response of the number
of inventors (and in turn of aggregate innovation) to changes in financial incentives is muted when
exposure to innovation is low. Naturally, only the agents who are exposed to innovation respond to a
change in τ . Given Bell et al.’s (2019) evidence that rates of innovation are low in many subgroups of
the population because of a lack of exposure, this result implies that changes in financial incentives
may have very muted effects on the number of inventors.12
The second result in Proposition 1 (forecastable returns) focuses on the case where heterogeneity
in inventors’ incomes is driven entirely by known differences in abilities rather than stochastic shocks.
In this case, the elasticity of aggregate innovation Φ with respect to changes in financial returns is
determined purely by the skewness of the distribution of innovation abilities. The elasticity falls as
the skewness of the ability distribution rises (βα → 1) because there are fewer individuals who are
on the margin of entering the innovation sector, whose decisions would be influenced by small tax
changes. Moreover, aggregate quality-weighted innovation (Φ) is less responsive to changes in the
tax rate τ than the number of agents entering innovation (φ), as shown by Jaimovich and Rebelo
(2017). Intuitively, the marginal entrants who enter the innovation sector because of a reduction
in the tax rate τ must have lower ability than the average inventor already in the sector, thereby
increasing quality-weighted innovation by less than the total number of inventors. As the ability
distribution becomes more skewed (βα → 1), the elasticity of quality-weighted innovation with
respect to the tax rate converges to zero. In the limiting case, aggregate innovation is driven by a
Although the absolute impacts of tax changes ( dφ
and dΦ
) are proportional to exposure λ, the elasticities of φ

dτ
and Φ with respect to τ are invariant to λ. A lower value of λ reduces the rate of initial innovation at the same rate
as the derivatives, leaving the elasticity (percentage impacts) unchanged.
12

small fraction of star inventors whose behavior is insensitive to taxes because they have very high
earnings in the innovation sector relative to the outside option.
Figure IVa illustrates this result by plotting the number of inventors φ and quality-weighted
innovation Φ as a function of the tax rate on inventors’ earnings. In this simulation, we set βπ = ∞
(no stochastic shocks) and the skewness of the ability distribution βα = 1.26 to match the Pareto
shape parameter of 1.26 estimated using the inventors’ empirical earnings distribution shown in
Figure I. Both φ and Φ are normalized to 100% at a tax rate of τ = 0. As predicted by the
proposition, the number of inventors declines much faster than total innovation as the tax rate on
inventors’ earnings increases. For example, at a tax rate of τ = 40% on inventors’ earnings, the
total number of inventors φ is 48% smaller than it would be in the absence of taxes (τ = 0), but
aggregate quality-weighted innovation Φ is only depressed by 12.5%. While the exact numbers naturally depend upon model specification, these calculations suggest that aggregate quality-weighted
innovation may not be very sensitive to small changes in tax rates under parameters that match
the empirical distribution of inventors’ incomes.
The third result in Proposition 1 (stochastic returns) focuses on the case where heterogeneity in
inventors’ incomes is driven primarily by unforecastable shocks rather than known ability heterogeneity, i.e. where βπ → 1. The level of innovation φ converges to 0 as βπ → 1 when θ > 0 because
the expected value of innovation VI falls to 0 as the variance of payoffs grows large, holding the
mean payoff fixed, when individuals are risk averse. To obtain comparative statistics at the same
level of innovation φ0 as in the case with pure ability heterogeneity analyzed above, we reduce the
wage in the non-innovation sector wI¯ as βπ → 1 to keep the fraction of inventors fixed at φ0 .13
In this setting, as the skewness of stochastic shocks rises, both the elasticities of the number
of inventors and quality-weighted innovation with respect to tax rates converge to zero if agents
are risk averse (θ > 0). The logic underlying this result is easiest to understand in the context of
a limiting example with two states of the world: a bad state in which innovation has zero return
and a good state in which innovation has a large payoff, say $10 million. In the bad state, taxes
have no impact on utility. In the good state, a slightly smaller payout (e.g., $9 million instead of
$10 million) does not reduce an agent’s incentive to become an inventor by very much because the
marginal utility of consumption is already low this far out in the income distribution. Intuitively,
when returns are very skewed, taxes only affect inventors’ payoffs when they are very deep in the
13

Formally, we change wI¯ to κ(βπ ) · wI¯ as we vary βπ , choosing the scaling factor κ to keep the fraction of inventors
at φ0 , which one can interpret as a fixed (empirically observed) level of innovation. See Appendix for further details.

money and are not sensitive to financial incentives, resulting in small behavioral responses. Put
differently, when innovation has very risky payoffs, inventors must enter innovation partly because
of its non-monetary benefits, making their behavior less sensitive to financial incentives.
Figure IVb illustrates this result by plotting innovation rates vs. taxes when the heterogeneity
in inventors’ incomes is driven primarily by stochastic shocks rather than differences in ability.
We calibrate the model so that stochastic returns account for 90% of the skewness in inventors’
earnings and the income distribution has a Pareto shape parameter of 1.26 as above.14 We consider
two cases: θ = 0 (risk neutral agents, linear utility) and θ = 1 (risk averse agents, log utility).
With linear utility, taxes have very large effects: a tax rate of τ = 40% reduces quality-weighted
innovation Φ by 70.5% relative to the benchmark with no taxes. But when agents are risk averse,
taxes have modest effects: Φ falls by only 9.4% from the no-tax benchmark when τ = 40%. These
calculations suggest that tax changes are likely to have modest effects on aggregate innovation even
when the returns to innovation are uncertain, under the standard assumption that individuals have
diminishing marginal utilities of consumption.
In sum, Proposition 1 implies that the decisions of individuals who contribute most to aggregate
innovation are unlikely to be very sensitive to small changes in financial incentives in canonical models of career choice that match our empirical findings regarding the skewness of inventors’ incomes
and the correlation between private and social returns. Importantly, the second and third results
in Proposition 1 show that this conclusion holds regardless of whether the returns to innovation are
known at the point of career choice or not.

IV.D

Effects of Changes in Exposure

We now contrast the impact of changes in financial incentives with the impact of changes in exposure
(λ) on rates of innovation.
Proposition 2.

The elasticities of the number of inventors and aggregate innovation with respect

to exposure λ are both equal to one: Φ,λ = φ,λ = 1.
Proposition 2 shows that, unlike the impact of changes in financial payoffs, the impact of changing exposure is invariant to the skewness of the distribution of inventors’ earnings or other pa14

Formally, we set βπ and βα such that s ≡

− 1 = 0.9 and the equilibrium income

distribution has a shape parameter of 1.26. We retain 10% of skewness from variation in ability because the model is
degenerate if we only allow for heterogeneity from stochastic shocks, since there is no source of ex-ante heterogeneity
across agents other than ability in our model.

15

rameters of the model. Increasing exposure simply scales up the fraction of individuals who enter
innovation. For instance, increasing λ from 10% to 20% mechanically doubles the (randomly selected) set of individuals who are exposed to and enter the innovation sector. This doubles aggregate
quality-weighted innovation as well given our assumption that exposure is uncorrelated with individuals’ abilities to innovate.
Proposition 2 implies that there may be great potential to increase aggregate innovation by
increasing exposure in a subgroup g that currently has few inventors if the low rate of innovation
φg in that group is due to a lack of exposure (in which case there is scope to increase λg ) rather
than high barriers to entry τg . One way to determine whether the low innovation rate is driven by
exposure effects or barriers to entry is by examining the average quality of inventions for inventors
in that subgroup. The following corollary formalizes this result:
Corollary 1.

If the distribution of innovation abilities does not vary across groups, differences

in the average quality of inventions reveal whether differences in innovation rates arise from barriers
to entry or exposure effects.
1. [Barriers to entry] Groups that face higher barriers to entry τ have higher-quality inventions
conditional on inventing: φ declines with τ , while E[ν · ri |αi > ᾱ] increases with τ .
2. [Exposure] Groups that have less exposure to innovation λ have the same quality of inventions
conditional on inventing: φ declines with λ, but E[ν · ri |αi > ᾱ] does not vary with λ.
The first result in this corollary follows from the logic in the second part of Proposition 1. The
marginal inventor who is screened out as barriers to entry rise is of lower quality than the average
inventor. The inventors who remain in groups that face high costs of entering innovation thus have
higher quality patents on average. The second result follows from the logic underlying Proposition
2. Since an increase in exposure simply draws in randomly selected inventors, groups that have less
exposure do not have inventors of different quality on average.
Bell et al. (2019, Figure XI) show that in practice, individuals from under-represented groups
– e.g., children from low-income families, women, and minorities – who become inventors do not
have higher-quality patents on average, as measured by their citations per patent or incomes. Based
on Corollary 1, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the low rates of innovation
among certain groups are driven primarily by a lack of exposure rather than fixed costs of entry that
screen out inventors of marginal quality, as in Hsieh et al. (2016). Put differently, subgroups with

16

few inventors are just as under-represented among “star” inventors as they are among inventors
as a whole. Hence, there may be substantial scope to increase aggregate innovation by increasing
exposure among such groups; indeed, Bell et al. (2019) find that the number of inventors in the
U.S. would quadruple if women, minorities, and children from low-income families were to invent
at the same rate as white men from high-income families.

V

Conclusion

Many countries provide substantial financial incentives to spur innovation through R&D tax credits
and direct grants. Indeed, the potential for higher rates of innovation and entrepreneurship is
frequently cited as an argument for reductions in top income tax rates. In this paper, we studied
the impacts of financial incentives on one important margin that contributes to aggregate innovation:
the supply of inventors. Using new panel data covering virtually all inventors in the U.S. from 19962012, we first showed that the private returns to innovation (measured by inventors’ incomes in tax
records) are extremely skewed, highly correlated with their scientific impact, and are often largest
in the middle of individuals’ careers. We then constructed a stylized model of career choice that
matches these facts as well as evidence from our companion paper (Bell et al. 2019) showing that
childhood exposure to innovation plays a critical role in determining whether individuals become
inventors.
Our model predicts that financial incentives have limited potential to increase aggregate innovation because (i) they only affect individuals who are exposed to innovation and (ii) they have
no impact on the decisions of star inventors who matter most for aggregate innovation, because
the private financial returns to high-impact innovations are already quite large. Although lower
income tax rates do increase the number of inventors, their impact on aggregate (quality-weighted)
innovation is likely to be quantitatively small. In contrast, increasing exposure to innovation could
have substantial impacts on innovation by drawing more star inventors (“Einsteins”) into the field.
Our analysis implies that widely-used neoclassical models of career choice cannot generate large
elasticities of quality-weighted inventor supply with respect to financial incentives when calibrated
to match empirical evidence on the returns to innovation. This result points to two directions for
further work: more careful assessment of the impacts of financial incentives and consideration of
alternative policies to increase the supply of innovation.
In the context of financial incentives, it would be useful to test the predictions of our model
regarding career choice decisions, perhaps by building on recent quasi-experimental studies of taxes
17

and innovation (e.g., Moretti and Wilson 2017, Akcigit et al. 2018). Such analyses would both
shed light on the empirical relevance of our predictions and elucidate how standard models of career
choice must be modified to fit the empirical findings. In particular, if taxes affect rates of innovation
significantly, they may do so through other mechanisms beyond career choice, such as the behavior
of inventors within firms, agglomeration patterns, or general equilibrium effects.
A second natural direction for future work is to explore other policies to increase the supply of
inventors beyond financial incentives. We focused here on one such possibility: increasing exposure
to innovation during childhood. Changes in exposure could have substantial effects: for instance,
Bell et al. (2019) estimate that moving a child from a metropolitan area that is at the 25th percentile of the distribution in terms of inventors per capita to the 75th percentile would increase a
child’s probability of becoming an inventor by 37%. Developing feasible policies that could provide
such exposure without having to move families would be very valuable. More broadly, identifying
policies that escape the diminishing marginal returns of financial incentives by drawing star inventors into the innovation pipeline – whether through exposure, human capital investments, or other
interventions – could greatly increase the supply of innovation.

Notes: This table presents summary statistics for the 1,200,689 inventors used in the empirical analysis.
We define individuals as inventors if they were listed as an inventor on a patent application between 20012012 or grant between 1996-2014 and linked to the tax data. Citations are measured as total patent
citations between 1996-2014. The number of collaborators is measured as the number of distinct
individuals that the inventor has ever co-authored a patent grant or application with in our linked dataset.
For individuals with more than one patent application, age at application is the age at a randomly selected
patent application filing. Incomes are measured in 2012. Individual wage earnings is defined as total
earnings reported on an individual's W-2 forms. Total individual income is defined for tax filers as
Adjusted Gross Income (as reported on the 1040 tax return) minus the spouse's W-2 wage earnings (for
married filers). For non-filers, total individual income is defined as wage earnings. Wage earnings are topcoded at $1 million and total individual income is top-coded at $10 million. Median income variables are
rounded to the nearest thousand dollars. See Section II.A and Bell et al. (2019) for further details on
sample and variable definitions.

Notes: This figure is reproduced from Online Appendix Figure V of Bell et al. (2019). In both panels, the sample
consists of all individuals in our full inventors sample born between the ages of 1959-1962, for whom we see income at
all ages between 40 and 50. Income is measured at the individual level and includes both labor and capital income;
see Section II for details. Panel A plots a kernel density of the distribution of inventors’ income, measured as mean
annual income over ages 40-50 in 2012 dollars. For scaling purposes, the top and bottom percentiles of the distribution
are omitted when plotting this density. Panel B presents a binned scatter plot of average annual income between ages
40 and 50 vs. the total number of citations an inventor obtains. For this panel, we further limit the sample to the
13,875 individuals who applied for a patent in 1996 to maximize the time horizon over which we can measure future
citations. This plot is constructed by dividing citations into 21 bins and plotting mean income vs. mean citations
within each bin. The first 19 bins include inventors in the first 19 ventiles (5% bins) of the citations distribution,
while the last two bins plot the same relation for the 95th to 98th percentiles and the 99th percentile of the citation
distribution. The best fit line and slope shown on the figure are estimated using an OLS regression on the 21 points,
weighted by the number of inventors in each bin. The standard error of the slope estimate is reported in parentheses.

sample who applied for a patent in 2000 that was subsequently granted. Panel A presents a kernel density of the age
distribution of these inventors. Panel B plots the fraction of workers (individuals with positive W-2 earnings) who
patent in 2000 by age. Panel C plots the fraction of workers who filed a patent application in 2000 that went on to
become highly-cited (in the top 5% of the distribution). The curves in Panels B and C are cubic splines.

Notes: This figure plots the income profiles of inventors before and after they file patent applications using all
individuals for whom the relevant data is available in our full inventors sample. Income is measured as total income
(including wage earnings and capital income) at the individual level; see Section II for details. Panel A plots the
median incomes by age of inventors who file a patent application at either age 30, 40, or 50 over the range of ages
for which their incomes are observed (between 1996-2012). Panel B generalizes this analysis using an event study
framework, defining year 0 as the year in which an individual files a patent application and other years relative to
this reference year (e.g., +1 is the year after the application). In this panel, we limit the sample to individuals
who file patent applications between ages 35 and 50. For individuals who file multiple patents in this age window,
we choose one of the patents at random to define the reference year. We plot the mean and median (left y axis)
and 99th percentile (right y axis) of the income distribution of inventors in each year relative to the event year.
Panel C replicates the median income series in Panel B, separating inventors into three groups: those whose patent
applications were not granted; those whose applications were granted; and those with patents granted that went on
to have citations in the top 5% of the distribution relative to other patents granted in the same year.

Notes: This figure plots the fraction of inventors (φ) and aggregate quality-weighted innovation (Φ) vs. the tax rate
on inventors’ earnings predicted by our model of career choice. Panel A considers the case where the variation in
private financial returns to innovation is driven purely by differences in ability across inventors and hence is perfectly
forecastable at the time of career choice. Panel B considers the case where the variance in private returns come
primarily from stochastic shocks, with a coefficient of relative risk aversion θ = 0 (linear utility) or 1 (log utility).
The shape parameters for the Pareto distributions of stochastic returns and innovation abilities, denoted βπ and
βα in the model, are chosen such that the inventors’ earnings distribution generated by the model matches the
Pareto shape parameter of 1.26 estimated using inventors’ empirical earnings distribution in Figure I, i.e. such that

s ≡ βπ −1 − 1 / βαβα−1 − 1 + βπβπ−1 − 1 = 0.9. In each series, the level of innovation is normalized to 100% when
the tax rate is 0. The normalized values are invariant to the other parameters of the model (wI¯, λ, and θ in Panel A).

APPENDIX: DERIVATIONS AND PROOFS
In this appendix, we first present analytical formulas for the key expressions in our model, then
describe the comparative statics of interest, and finally present proofs of the propositions in Section

Comparative Statics. Our goal is to compute elasticities of innovation with respect to tax rates
in two scenarios, holding fixed the fraction of inventors at a given (empirically observed) level: (a)
the case where βπ → ∞ (i.e., there are no stochastic shocks) and (b) the case where βπ → 1 (i.e.,
the skewness of stochastic shocks grows arbitrarily large).
In the first case, we simply compute the elasticities of φ and Φ with respect to the net-of-tax
rate 1 − τ around the level of innovation φ0 that prevails when βπ → ∞. Using equations (1) and
(2), these elasticities are:
φ,(1−τ ) =

dφ 1 − τ
= βα ,
d(1 − τ ) φ

(4)

Φ,(1−τ ) =

dΦ 1 − τ
= βα − 1.
d(1 − τ ) Φ

(5)

In the second case, the level of innovation φ converges to 0 as βπ → 1 when θ > 0 because
the expected value of innovation VI falls to 0 as the variance of payoffs grows large holding the
mean payoff fixed. To obtain comparative statistics that are comparable to the first case, we hold
the fraction of inventors fixed at φ0 (the same level as in the first case) by varying the wage in
the non-innovation sector wI¯ as βπ → 1. In particular, we change wI¯ to κ(βπ ) · wI¯ as we vary βπ ,
choosing the scaling factor κ to keep the fraction of inventors at φ0 as a function of βπ . Formally,
for a given change in skewness from a reference level βπB to the level of interest βπ , κ(βπ ) is chosen
such that the threshold to enter innovation ᾱ(βπ , κ) = ᾱ(βπB ), i.e.
βπ − 1 βπB
κ(βπ ) =
βπ βπB − 1

When the reference level of skewness

inventors fixed at φ0 ), the elasticity of innovation w.r.t. 1 − τ is:
