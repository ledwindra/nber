Trade Protectionism and US Manufacturing Employment

NBER Working Paper No. 25860
May 2019
JEL No. C68,F16,F62
ABSTRACT
This paper uses a numerical global general equilibrium model to simulate the possible effects of
US initiated trade protection measures on US manufacturing employment. The simulation results
show that US trade protection measures do not increase but will instead reduce manufacturing
employment, and US losses will further increase if trade partners take retaliatory measures. The
mechanism is that although the substitution effects between domestic and foreign goods have
positive impacts, the substitution effects between manufacturing and service sectors and the
retaliatory effects both have negative influences, therefore the whole effect is that the US will
lose manufacturing employment.

1. Introduction
Protecting and promoting manufacturing employment is one of the most important
objectives of recent and prospective US trade protection measures. The logic often
claimed is that reduced imports by tariffs can protect targeted domestic sectors and
increase employment. But this is just the direct inference, and does not take into account
of other influencing mechanisms. There are three other factors influencing trade
protectionism effects on manufacturing employment. Firstly; substitution effects
between domestic and foreign goods, which determine how much foreign consumption
will be moved to domestic goods after tariff measures. Secondly; substitution effects
between manufacturing and service sectors, which determines how much
manufacturing consumption will be moved to service sectors. Finally; the retaliation
effect. The US tariff measures will undoubtedly encounter retaliation from other
countries, which may destroy positive effects of protection. Therefore, it is ambiguous
how the US trade protectionism would influence manufacturing employment and so the
US hope to increase manufacturing employment through trade protectionism may be
just be a wishful dream. Additionally, trade protection measures also have other
negative impacts; they prevent a country from reaping the benefits of specialization,
disrupt the movement of goods and services, and they lead to a misallocation of
resources. Also, consumers and producers often pay higher prices when tariffs are
implemented.
There are several other papers which numerically explore the effects of the US
trade protectionism but none has manufacturing employment as its objective. Guo et al.
3

(2018) uses a multi-sector, multi-country general equilibrium (GE) model with
intersectional linkages to forecast how exports, imports, output, and real wages would
change if Trump’s threat of 45% tariffs to China is carried out. Ciuriak and Xiao (2018)
introduce the GTAP general equilibrium model to quantify the impacts of the US
section 232 steel and aluminium tariffs to Canada. Bouet and Laborde (2017) use a
static multi-country and multi-sector Armington trade model to evaluate potential trade
wars between the US and emerging countries. But little research has been done on the
trade protection effects on manufacturing employment. Li et al. (2018) explores the
economic impacts of the possible China-US trade wars with a numerical GE simulation
methodology, and finds a negative influence to the US manufacturing employment.
Petersen et al. (2017) uses a numerical GE model to simulate the effects of the US
withdrawal from NAFTA, introducing a border adjustment tax and trade protection
measures to the rest of the world. Results show that tariff measures from the US will
hurt manufacturing employment. But this research are not focused on the
manufacturing employment effects.
Additionally, there is a series of literature exploring reasons of the US
manufacturing employment decline. One stream of papers evaluates whether Chinese
exports can account for the decline of US manufacturing employment, including David
et al. (2013), Feenstra et al. (2017), Amiti et al (2017), etc. Another stream of papers
exploring relations of technological change and the falling US manufacturing
employment, including Harrison and McMillan (2011), Ebenstein et al. (2014),
Harrison and Fontagne (2017), and etc. These papers relate to the reasons for the US
4

trade protection measures, but do not look at the influence of trade protection measures
on manufacturing employment.
Based on these backgrounds, we build a multi-country and multi-sector GE model
with endogenous trade imbalance to numerically simulate the manufacturing
employment effects of the US trade wars with other countries, including China, the EU,
Canada and Mexico. The purpose of the research is to check whether the US trade
protection measures can increase manufacturing employment. Our simulation results
will have implications for US trade protectionism measures, and also improve
understanding of theoretical relations between trade protectionism and manufacturing
employment.
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the GE model, data and
parameter calibration. Section 3 reports the simulation results for different scenarios.
Section 4 gives sensitivity and robustness analysis results. Section 5 draws conclusions
and policy implications.

2. GE Model, Data and Parameters Calibration
2.1 Model Structure
We build a global general equilibrium model and add a monetary structure using
inside money following Whalley et al. (2011) to endogenously determine the trade
imbalance. In our global general equilibrium model with monetary structure, we allow
inter-commodity trade to co-exist within the period along with trade in debt in the form
of inside money. We use a single period model where either claim on future
consumption (money holding) or future consumption liabilities (money issuance) enter
the utility function as incremental future consumption from current period savings. This
is the formulation of inside money used by Patinkin (1971) and Archibald and Lipsey
(1960).
We assume M

conditions subject to the endowment constraints imply the factor input demand
equations.

Consumption functions for each country is a nested CES utility function. We use
the Armington assumption of product heterogeneity across countries, and assume
claims on future consumption enter preferences and are traded between countries. Each
country can thus either issue or buy claims on future consumption using current period
income. The first utility level has N consumption goods and one inside money.
For simplicity, we consume a two goods situation, which are manufacturing goods
and non-manufacturing goods, so the first level utility function is

country i , and Yi denotes the inside money for the country i . Additionally D i1 , D i 2
and D i 3 are share parameters and V i is the top level elasticity of substitution in
consumption.
The composite of manufacturing goods is defined by the other consumption level
reflecting the country from which goods come. We assume that this level two composite
consumption is of CES form and represented as,

0 implies trade balance.

For trade deficit countries, the utility will decrease in inside money since they are
the issuer. In order to capture this given that Yi  0 for these countries, we use an
upper bound Y 0 in the utility function in a term [ Y 0  Yi ] following Whalley et al.
(2011) and assume that Y 0 is large enough to ensure that Y 0  Yi ! 0 . We use the

Using the general equilibrium model above, we can calibrate it to a base case data
set and then simulate the potential effects.
2.2 Data and Parameters Calibration
We use 2016 as our base year in building a benchmark numerical general
equilibrium dataset for use in calibration and simulation. We include 29 countries in
our numerical model; Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, EU
(Europe Union), India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, New
Zealand, Oman, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, Russian, Saudi Arabia,
Singapore, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, US (United States), Vietnam, and ROW
(rest of world). Production factors in our numerical models include capital (K) and
labour (L). We include only two goods in our model structures, which are
manufacturing goods and non- manufacturing goods.
All countries’ factor input and production data are calculated from WDI of World
Bank database. We use agriculture and service share of GDP data and GDP data to yield
10

production data of manufacturing goods and non-manufacturing goods and use
capital/GDP ratio to yield capital and labour input in production. We set the upper
bound ( Y 0 ) in our monetary structure to equal 1000 in all countries. We use world
values minus all individual countries to generate ROW values. For the two goods, we
assume secondary industry (manufacturing) reflects manufacturing goods, and primary
and tertiary industries (agriculture, extractive industries, and services) yield nonmanufacturing goods. For the two factor inputs, we use total labour income (wage) to
denote labour values for inputs by sector. We adjust some of the data values for mutual
consistency for calibration purposes.
Trade data between each pair of countries are from the UN Comtrade database.
We use individual country total export and import values to indirectly yield exports to
and imports from the ROW. Using production and trade data, we can then calculate
each country’s consumption values. We obtain each country’s import tariff data from
the WTO Statistics Database. For ROW, we cannot obtain its import tariff directly, and
so we use world average tariff rate to denote its value.
There are no available estimates of elasticities for individual countries on the
demand and production sides of the model. Many of the estimates of domestic and
import goods substitution elasticity are around two, so we set all these elasticities in our
model to two (Whalley and Wang, 2010). We change these elasticities later in sensitivity
analysis to check their influence on simulation results.
With these data, we calibrate the model parameters. When used in model solution

11

these will regenerate the benchmark data as an equilibrium for the model. Then, using
these parameters we can simulate the effects of the different scenarios we set in the
paper.

12

3. Simulation Results
The US had already initiated tariff wars with China, the EU, Canada and Mexico
and we explore the effects of different country groups one by one to check whether the
US can gain from tariff protection on manufacturing employment. For each country
group scenario, we analyse both the US unilateral tariff wars and bilateral tariff wars
(tariff initiation and retaliation). For each type of tariff wars, we set three levels of tariffs
which are 30%, 45% and 60%. For the simulation results, we mainly pay attention to
the effects on the US, and also some tariff wars related countries of Canada, China, the
EU and Mexico. Additionally, employment effects on the whole world will be included
in our analysis either.
3.1 Manufacturing Employment Effects of the US Tariff Wars with China
The US-China tariff war simulation results show that the US will lose on
manufacturing employment in both unilateral and bilateral tariff wars. As the tariff level
increases, the US lose more on manufacturing employment. Meanwhile, negative
effects to the US are larger in bilateral tariff wars than in unilateral tariff wars. Therefore,
although import tariffs protected the US domestic manufacturing sectors and may
switch demands from foreign to domestic, the increased consumption price also
switched demand and production from manufacturing sectors to service sectors. Then
the whole effect is that the US manufacturing production and employment decrease.
Specifically, under the US unilateral tariff wars, US manufacturing employment with
the tariff rates of 30%, 45% and 60% are separately -1.329%, -1.786% and -2.152%.

13

Under bilateral tariff wars, US manufacturing employments with the tariff rates of 30%,
45% and 60% are separately -2.639%, -3.326% and -3.809% (see Table 1).

China as a country involved in a tariff war also suffers on manufacturing
employment because China has been hurt by the US tariff protection measures. With
the increase of the import tariff rate, the negative impact on China's manufacturing
employment is increasing. Compared with negative impacts to the US, China loses less.
Meanwhile, negative effects to China under bilateral tariff wars are stronger than under
unilateral tariff wars. Specifically, manufacturing employment effects under unilateral
tariff wars at tariff rates of 30%, 45% and 60% are separately -0.099%, -0.13% and 0.152%; effects under bilateral tariff wars are separately -0.547%, -0.701% and -0.816%
(see Table 1).
Manufacturing employment effects on other countries outside of the tariff wars are
all positive. As the import tariff rates increase, the positive effects increase.
Additionally, positive effects to other countries are larger under bilateral tariff wars.
World manufacturing employment will decrease under the US-China tariff wars,
negative effects are larger as tariff war rates increase and larger under bilateral tariff
wars. Specifically, under unilateral trade wars with tariff rates of 30%, 45% and 60%,
14

world manufacturing employment will separately decrease 0.235%, 0.325% and
0.399%; and under bilateral trade wars with tariff rates of 30%, 45% and 60%, world
manufacturing employment will separately decrease 0.521%, 0.668% and 0.773% (see
Table 1).
3.2 Manufacturing Employment Effects of the US Tariff Wars with EU
Under the US and EU tariff trade wars, all involved countries will lose, meaning
that the US cannot gain employment from trade protection measures. Comparatively,
the US will lose more manufacturing employment than the EU. The larger the tariff
rates both regions levy, the stronger the negative effects of manufacturing employment
to both. Negative effects under bilateral trade wars are more severe under unilateral
trade wars. Specifically, the US will receive negative effects of -1.338, -1.778% and 2.122% under unilateral tariff wars of 30%, 45% and 60% rates, and receive negative
effects of -3.649%, -3.283% and -5.779%. The manufacturing employment effects to
the EU under unilateral 30%, 45% and 60% rates of tariff wars are separately -0.762%,
-1.024% and -1.233%, and under the bilateral tariff wars these effects are separately 1.081%, -1.561% and -1.726% (see Table 2).

Manufacturing employment effects to uninvolved countries are mostly positive,
except China under the US-EU bilateral tariff wars. China’s received negative effects
under bilateral tariff wars is determined by trade relations between countries, because
both the US and EU are China’s big trade partners. The US-EU tariff wars have negative
impacts on the world, and the effects are larger under bilateral trade wars. As the tariff
rates increase, the world manufacturing employment negative effects increase.
3.3 Manufacturing Employment Effects of the US Tariff Wars with Canada
If the US and Canada have tariff wars, both countries will lose on manufacturing
employment, and comparatively Canada loses much more than the US. As tariff rates
increase, the negative employment effects on both countries increase. Simulation
results prove that the US cannot gain manufacturing employment when having trade
wars with Canada. Specifically, under unilateral tariff wars with 30%, 45% and 60%
rates, the US manufacturing employment will lose -1.617%, -2.128% and -2.521%, and
Canada will lose -14.009%, -18.932% and -22.898%. Meanwhile, under bilateral tariff
wars with 30%, 45% and 60% rates, the US manufacturing employment will separately
lose -3.035%, -3.575% and -4.203%, and Canada will separately lose -23.078%, 23.919% and -28.435% (see Table 3).
Manufacturing employment effects to other countries outside of trade wars are
mostly positive except China under unilateral tariff wars and some lower tariff rate
bilateral tariff wars. The world as a whole will lose on manufacturing employment
under both unilateral and bilateral US-Canada tariff wars. Specifically, under unilateral

16

tariff wars with rates of 30%, 45% and 60%, the world manufacturing employment will
decrease separately -0.479%, -0.642% and -0.771%; and under bilateral tariff wars with
rates of 30%, 45% and 60%, the world will decrease separately -0.908%, -1.113% and
-1.315% (see Table 3).

3.4 Manufacturing Employment Effects of the US Tariff Wars with Mexico
Under the US-Mexico trade wars, both countries’ manufacturing employment will
decrease and comparatively Mexico’s relative decrease is much more than the US. As
import tariffs increase, both countries’ loss on manufacturing employment increases.
Meanwhile, both countries’ manufacturing employment will decrease more under
bilateral tariff wars than under unilateral tariff wars. Specifically, under unilateral tariff
wars with tariff rates of 30%, 45% and 60%, the US manufacturing employment will
decrease separately by -1.254%, -1.658% and -1.971%; and Mexico will decrease
separately by -11.394%, -15.474% and -18.79%. Under bilateral tariff wars with tariff
rates of 30%, 45% and 60%, the US manufacturing employment will decrease
separately by -2.099%, -2.75% and -3.245%; and Mexico will decrease separately by 13.85%, -18.514% and -22.191% (see Table 4).

17

Other countries outside of the US-Mexico tariff wars can mostly gain on
manufacturing employment, with the exception of China. China’s manufacturing
employment will decrease under trade wars between the US and Mexico. The whole
world’s manufacturing employment will decrease under both unilateral and bilateral
US-Mexico tariff wars. Specifically, the world’s manufacturing employment will
separately decrease by -0.353%, -0.475% and -0.573% under unilateral tariff wars with
tariff rates of 30%, 45% and 60%; and decrease by -0.617%, -0.815% and -0.968%
under bilateral tariff wars with tariff rates of 30%, 45% and 60% (see Table 4).

4. Sensitivity and Robustness Analysis
We perform sensitivity analysis to preference elasticities, and robustness check
with trade cost wars and different model structure simulations.
4.1 Sensitivity Analysis to Preference Elasticities
Preference elasticities in our paper are randomly determined to equal two
according to some literature. We need to have a sensitivity analysis to preference
elasticities. We change preference elasticities to separately equal 1.5, 3.0 and 4.5 to
check the sensitivity of simulation results. As we have two different preference
elasticities in our utility function, which are elasticities of manufacturing and nonmanufacturing goods, and elasticities of domestic and foreign goods. Therefore, we
perform sensitivity analysis to both elasticities separately and simultaneously, totalling
three different situations.
For simplicity, we only report sensitivity analysis results to the US-China bilateral
tariff war with 45% rate. Sensitivity analysis results are listed in Table 5. Columns 2-4
are sensitivity analysis to elasticity of manufacturing and non-manufacturing goods.
Columns 5-7 are sensitivity analysis to elasticities of domestic and foreign goods.
Columns 8-10 are sensitivity analysis to simultaneous change of both elasticities.
Results show that negative effects to both China and the US on manufacturing
employments increase as elasticity of manufacturing and non-manufacturing goods
increase, decrease as elasticity of domestic and foreign goods increase, and increase as

4.2 Robustness Check with Both Tariff and Non-tariff Wars
Above analysis only analysed the manufacturing employment effects of trade wars,
and we further explore the effects of trade cost (both tariff and non-tariff) wars to check
the robustness of our simulation results.
In order to analyse the trade cost war effects, we introduce trade costs into the
model. Trade costs include not only import tariffs but also other non-tariff barriers such
as transportation costs, language barriers and institutional barriers. We divide trade
costs into two parts in our model, import tariff and non-tariff trade costs. For non-tariff
trade costs, they are different from the import tariff: they cannot collect revenue, and
importers need to use actual resources to cover the costs involved. In the numerical
model, we assume that the resource costs involved in overcoming all other non-tariff
barriers are denominated in terms of domestic non-tradable goods. We incorporate this
resource feature through the use of non-tradable goods equal in value terms to the cost
of the barrier. We calculate trade costs following the approaches in Wong (2012) and
Novy (2013). Their method is to take the ratio of bilateral trade flows over local trade,
20

scaled to some parameter values, and then use a measure that captures all barriers.
Using the GE model with trade cost, we simulate the manufacturing employment
effects of trade cost wars. For simplicity, we only report the results of the US-China
trade cost wars. Simulation results show that negative effects of manufacturing
employment to both the US and China are stronger under trade cost wars and that
comparatively the US loss is larger than Chinas. All other results are the same as under
tariff wars. Specifically, negative effects of manufacturing employment to the US under
unilateral trade cost wars with import rates of 30%, 45% and 60% are -2.519%, -3.106%
and -3.493%; and under bilateral trade cost wars are -4.237%, -4.846% and -5.187%.
Negative effects of manufacturing employment to China under unilateral trade cost
wars with import rates of 30%, 45% and 60% are -0.154%, -0.186% and -0.207%; and
under bilateral trade cost wars are -1.014%, -1.195% and -1.303% (see Table 6).
Robustness checks with trade cost wars prove that the above simulation results are
reliable.

4.3 Robustness Check with Different Model Structures
We use a different model structure to check the robustness of our simulation results.

21

We introduce another kind of endogenous trade imbalance model structure to do our
simulation. We follow Whalley and Wang (2010) to build the model structure. In
traditional models, money is neutral in the sense that once domestic money supplies are
specified, an equilibrium exchange rate is determined independently of the real side,
and a fixed exchange rate regime and trade imbalance does not occur. If the exchange
rate is fixed, then the relative domestic money stock needs to accommodate it so as to
support it as an equilibrium exchange rate. In the structure we use, the monetary regime
is non-accommodative to the fixed exchange rate; and in this case the trade surplus or
deficit will be endogenously determined by the equation
Si

Ii  M i

(17)

Where Si is trade surplus for country i , I i is the total income of country i ,

M i is the money supply in country i . Once money supply in country i has been
fixed, then the trade imbalance for country i will be endogenously determined. Global
trade clearance determines that all of countries’ trade should be balanced, which is

¦S

i

0

(18)

i

We add these conditions in the global general equilibrium model yielding an
endogenous monetary trade imbalance GE model. Using this new model, we simulate
our analysis. For simplicity, we only report the results of the US-China tariff wars.
Simulation results reveal that manufacturing employments of both the US and China
will decrease, and comparatively the US decrease more than China. Simulation results
with this different model structure are close to above main results, which proves the

22

robustness of our simulation results (see Table 7).

5. Conclusions and Remarks
This paper uses a numerical 29-country global GE model with inside money to
endogenously determine trade imbalance, and simulate manufacturing employment
effects of the US initiated trade protection measures including both unilateral and
bilateral tariff measures. We set three levels of tariff rates to separately equal 30%, 45%
and 60%, and explore the US tariff wars with China, the EU, Canada and Mexico.
Simulation results suggest that the US may not gain manufacturing employment by
taking trade protection measures against China, the EU, Canada and Mexico. Instead,
US manufacturing employment may decrease when taking trade protection measures
against its trade partner countries. As the US tariff rate increases, the manufacturing
employment losses of both countries in the trade war increase. The US’s manufacturing
employment losses are larger than partner countries in the US-China trade war and the
US-EU trade war, and are smaller than partner countries in the US-Canada trade war
and the US-Mexico trade war. Sensitivity analysis finds that both trade war involved
countries’ manufacturing employment loss increases as the preference elasticity of
manufacturing and non-manufacturing goods increases, decreases as the preference
elasticity of domestic and foreign goods increases, and increases as the whole
preference elasticity increases.
Our research results suggest that the US manufacturing employment will decrease
if the US take trade protection measures to some trade partner countries including China,
the EU, Canada and Mexico. US manufacturing employment will further decrease if

24

trade partner countries take retaliatory measures. This suggests that the US wanting to
save manufacturing employment through trade protection measures may be
unachievable.
