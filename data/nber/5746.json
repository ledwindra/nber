We estimate cost functions characteristics.   Then we examine how this cost surface has changed over time and how these changes relate to changes in gas prices and in emission standard regulations.  We also briefly consider the related questions of how changes in automobile characteristics, and in the rate of patenting, are related to regulations and gas prices.\n\n",
