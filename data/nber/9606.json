Its applicability to Brazil lies in the fact that (1) macro fundamentals were sound in the wake of the crisis (e .g., a non-negligible primary surplus, a relatively low debt/GDP ratio, low inflation, etc.); and (2) the trigger for the crisis appears to be the forthcoming elections, with an expected regime change.\n\n",
