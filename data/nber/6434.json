Using a sample of more than 400 U.S. mutual funds for 1976-94, the estimates imply that mutual funds behave as risk averse, benchmark investors.  Conditioning on public information variables improves the model specification, and after controlling for the public information we find no evidence that funds have significant market timing ability.\n\n",
