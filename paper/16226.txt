Leverage Constraints and the International Transmission of Shocks
Michael B. Devereux and James Yetman
NBER Working Paper No. 16226
July 2010
JEL No. F2,F33,F34
ABSTRACT
Recent macroeconomic experience has drawn attention to the importance of interdependence among
countries through financial markets and institutions, independently of traditional trade linkages. This
paper develops a model of the international transmission of shocks due to interdependent portfolio
holdings among leverage-constrained investors. In our model, without leverage constraints on investment,
financial integration itself has no implication for international macro co-movements. When leverage
constraints bind however, the presence of these constraints in combination with diversified portfolios
introduces a powerful financial transmission channel which results in a positive co-movement of production,
independently of the size of international trade linkages. In addition, the paper shows that, with binding
leverage constraints, the type of financial integration is critical for international co-movement. If international
financial markets allow for trade only in non-contingent bonds, but not equities, then the international
co-movement of shocks is negative. Thus, with leverage constraints, moving from bond trade to equity
trade reverses the sign of the international transmission ofVKocks.

1. Introduction
The recent international financial crisis has highlighted the critical role of financial
markets in the propagation of business cycle shocks, both in transmitting shocks from one
country to another and in magnifying the effects of those shocks. One key aspect of this
transmission mechanism, seen in both the recent crisis as well as the Asian and Russian crises a
decade ago, is the importance of balance sheet linkages among investors and financial
institutions across countries. This implies that asset price collapses in one country are transmitted
internationally through deteriorations in the balance sheets of institutions in countries holding
portfolios of similar assets.
It is widely agreed that high financial leverage – a high ratio of assets to underlying
capital – is a critical factor in the magnifying effects of financial crises. As asset values decline,
highly levered financial institutions find their net worth sharply eroded and are forced to shed
assets to avoid unacceptable risks of insolvency. But asset sales drive asset values down further,
adversely impairing the balance sheets of other institutions. These institutions in turn are forced
to sell assets, creating a vicious cycle of balance sheet deterioration and asset sales. While the
financial dynamics of such balance sheet adjustments have been widely discussed elsewhere, it is
less well understood how this process affects macroeconomic outcomes, or that this process
alone may generate an immediate and powerful international transmission of shocks.
A clear pre-requisite for balance sheet adjustments to have powerful macroeconomic
effects is the presence of financial frictions of some sort, or distortions in credit markets. After
all, in a Modigliani-Miller world, leverage is irrelevant. Thus, in order to capture the dynamics of
the financial meltdown, financial frictions will be of critical importance.

2

In the context of the international transmission of business cycles, however, other puzzles
arise. Most models of business cycle transmission still rely on international linkages due to trade
flows. While global trade has been growing at remarkable rates over the past two decades, it is
still the case that the major world regions – the United States, Asia and Europe – are to a large
extent ‘closed’ economies, with the share of inter-regional trade representing only a small
proportion of overall GDP. Thus Kose and Yi (2006) find that it is hard to account for the
magnitude of business cycle co-movements among countries using conventional international
real business cycle models. In addition there is evidence that business cycle co-movement is
greater between countries with greater financial integration (Imbs 2004, 2006). Nevertheless, in
the standard international business cycle model, enhanced international financial integration
actually tends to reduce business cycle co-movement, since it allows for a more efficient
reallocation of resources across countries in response to shocks (Heathcote and Perri 2002,
2005). But Krugman (2008) suggests that traditional multi-country business cycle models lack a
critical ‘international finance multiplier,’ by which financial shocks in one country affect
investment both in the original country and in other countries, through financial or balance sheet
linkages.
This paper develops a theoretical model of a balance sheet channel for the international
transmission of shocks. The model emphasizes how a process of balance sheet contractions,
generated by a downturn in one country, is spread across countries through inter-connected
portfolios. In the presence of leverage constraints, we show that this gives rise to a separate
financial transmission mechanism of business cycle shocks that is independent of trade linkages.1

1

In the recent literature, for example Krugman (2008), the adjustment of balance sheets is sometimes referred to as
‘de-leveraging.’ This term is inaccurate as a description of our model since, as in Kiyotaki and Moore (1997), the
leverage ratio is constant. Nonetheless, the process of satisfying leverage constraints in the wake of asset price

3

The paper’s main contribution is to compare how macro shocks are transmitted under different
financial market structures. We do not attempt to provide an integrated explanation of the recent
crisis, or a full quantitative calibration, but instead highlight how the joint process of balance
sheet constraints and portfolio interdependence generate an important cross-country propagation
effect. We develop a two-country model in which investors borrow from savers, and invest in
fixed assets. Investors also diversify their portfolios across countries and hold equity positions in
the assets of the other country, as well as their own. Investors cannot commit to repay savers,
however, and in order to ensure payment, may face limits on the maximum amount of leverage
on their balance sheets.
We analyze four different variants of the model. First we consider a version of the model
in which bond markets are segmented across countries but equity markets are integrated, both
with and without binding leverage constraints. In the case where leverage limits do not bind there
is no international transmission of shocks in final goods production. A negative productivity
shock, which leads to a fall in the value of assets in one country, will cause investors to sell some
assets and reduce their debt exposure, but this does not affect other countries. In fact investors in
other countries increase their borrowing. More broadly, business cycle fluctuations in final goods
production across countries are uncorrelated in the absence of limits on leverage.
When leverage constraints are binding, however, there is a powerful transmission of
shocks across countries. A fall in asset values in one country forces a large and immediate
process of balance sheet contractions for that country’s investors. But the fall in asset values
leads to balance sheet deterioration in other countries that have internationally diversified asset
portfolios, causing a sell-off in assets and a forced reduction in borrowing around the globe.

declines does impart a magnification effect on real activity. Endogenizing the maximum leverage ratio represents a
separate issue, beyond the scope of this paper. For a recent contribution, see Geanakoplos (2009).

4

This, in turn, drives a further sell-off in the first country, establishing a feedback loop. The end
result is a large magnification of the initial shock, a large fall in investment, and highly
correlated business cycles across countries during the resulting downturn.
We explore the relationship between financial integration and business cycle comovement further in a model with integrated bond markets. We assume that international bond
markets are integrated across countries and leverage constraints always bind. We then contrast
the properties of an economy without internationally diversified equity holdings with one with
fully integrated equity markets. In the case where equity markets are segmented, we find that
macroeconomic shocks are transmitted negatively across countries. A negative productivity
shock in the home country pushes down investment there, but the resulting decline in world
interest rates stimulates borrowing, investment and consumption in the foreign country. Hence
borrowing, asset prices, output and consumption all move in opposite directions in the two
countries.
The final variant of the model we explore is one where both bond and equity markets are
integrated. Here we find positive co-movement across countries that is similar to a world without
integrated bond markets.
The model has strong implications for understanding the effects of financial market
integration. In the presence of leverage constraints and internationally diversified equity
holdings, financial market integration (in equity markets) is associated with a ‘financial
contagion’ effect, in the sense that asset price movements cause negative shocks to be
propagated through balance sheets – propagation effects that would not occur in an international
economy without international portfolio diversification.

5

The contrasting results between the final two variants of the model also suggests that it
may be important to distinguish the ex-ante from the ex-post gains to international portfolio
diversification. In the absence of equity market integration, the presence of negative comovement in returns suggests substantial gains from portfolio diversification. But, in a world
with binding leverage constraints, the process of integrating equity markets leads to strong
positive co-movement in production, reducing the ex-post gains from diversification.2
The model draws heavily on a number of separate literatures. First, and most importantly,
we follow Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) in imposing leverage constraints on investors. This leads
to a wedge between the effective returns faced by investors and savers, and can act as an
amplification mechanism for business cycle shocks.3 Second, we emphasize the linkages among
countries through the presence of inter-connected portfolios. Portfolio linkages, in a somewhat
different context, have for some time been seen as important in the contagion effects of financial
shocks (see Rigobon 2003 and Pavlova and Rigobon 2008, for example). Finally, we introduce
endogenous portfolio interdependence through the recently developed techniques of Devereux
and Sutherland (2010a).4
The paper is organized as follows. The next section provides some evidence of the
importance of a financial channel in the recent business cycle downturn. We then develop the
basic two-country model in which investors and savers interact, but investors may be limited by
2

It is important to distinguish co-movement in final goods production from that of asset prices and consumption. In
almost any international macro model, greater financial market integration will give rise to positive co-movement in
consumption and asset prices. But, in the standard international RBC model with frictionless asset markets, financial
integration will tend to imply negative co-movement in production (and physical investment) – see, for example,
Backus et al. (1992), Baxter and Crucini (1995) and Heathcote and Perri (2002, 2005). The contribution here is to
show that leverage constraints, together with financial integration, tend to generate positive co-movement in final
goods production.
3
An alternative mechanism where balance sheets play a key role in business cycles is the ‘financial accelerator’
model of Bernanke et al. (1999). This has been extended to a multi-country setting by Gilchrist (2004).
4
Dedola and Lombardo (2009) develop an interesting model similar to the present paper based on the financial
accelerator model of Bernake et al. (2000), incorporating endogenous portfolios as in the present paper. They
emphasise a somewhat different type of transmission effect, unique to the financial accelerator model, coming from
the direct connection between risk-premia across countries.

leverage constraints. In section 4 we explore the effects of a negative productivity shock in one
country, and demonstrate the role of balance sheet adjustments in the propagation of business
cycle shocks across countries. Section 5 then extends the model to allow for integrated bond
markets, and section 6 considers the case of endogenous labor supply and investment. We then
conclude.
2. Empirical evidence
We present some empirical evidence that supports our contention that balance sheet
contractions may have been an important propagation mechanism for the current international
crisis. First, Figure 1 documents the global nature of the economic crisis, demonstrating a
remarkably synchronous collapse in economic growth rates for a sample of OECD countries. It is
unlikely that trade linkages alone could account for the simultaneous downturns seen in all
regions. If we take the US economy as the ultimate source of the financial crisis then it would be
easy to explain the scale of the downturn in Mexico, for instance. But Figure 1 illustrates
dramatic reductions in economic growth in many OECD economies, including some only
marginally linked to the US through trade flows.
In addition there is clear evidence that US banks reduced their outstanding claims on the
rest of the world. Table 1 contains short-term claims of US banks, for all OECD countries for
which data is available. This is the total stock among US reporting banks of all claims on the
destination economy with less than one year remaining until maturity. Under normal
circumstances new claims are issued and many maturing existing claims are rolled over each
quarter. A rapid decline in less than one year, then, implies little new issuance, and few existing
exposures being rolled over. There is a clear pattern overall that the largest OECD economies (by
size of claims) experienced a substantial fall in short-term US bank claims during 2008,

7

including France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Korea and Luxembourg. Further, total claims across
all countries declined by more than 20 percent, with half of that decline occurring in the final
quarter of 2008.

Aside from bank balance sheets, we can also find evidence consistent with balance sheet
contractions in other instruments. Equities in particular were believed by some policymakers to
be a vector of contagion, as the following quote by Rakesh Mohan, Deputy Governor of the
Reserve Bank of India, indicated:
“Our problems are mainly due to the sell-off by foreign institutional investors in the
domestic equity markets leading to a sharp reduction in net capital inflows and the sharp
slowdown in global economic activity and external demand.” (Mohan 2009)

This view is consistent with the data on international capital flows captured by the Treasury
International Capital System (Figure 2). The scale of the fall in both inflows and outflows
starting in late 2008 is unprecedented over the full sample of aggregate TIC data going back to
1980. In our model we will see that the balance sheet contractions implied by this, when
combined with binding leverage constraints among investors, can impart an independent
international transmission of shocks.

Financial linkages versus trade linkages
The effects of global balance sheet adjustments should be expected to vary by country.
Some economies are more dependent on capital inflows than others, and countries with low
credit ratings may suffer more from a sudden reduction in flows than higher rated countries, for
example. Empirical evidence of the effects of a financial channel should reflect differences in
vulnerabilities across countries.
We demonstrate the importance of balance sheet contractions as a propagation
mechanism for the crisis using regression analysis. As a rough measure of the international effect

10

of the crisis, we use the change in the growth rate of real GDP between the year ended December
2007 and December 2008. The vulnerability of countries to a sudden outflow of capital is
calculated as total capital inflows from the US, as a percent of 2007 GDP, using US Treasury
International Capital data (labeled TIC). Our sample includes all members of the OECD for
which TIC data is available. We also include trade linkages, measured using exports to the US in
2007 as a percent of GDP (X). Finally, we interact each of these variables with the sovereign
credit rating of the economy (CR), to capture the idea that capital withdrawals are likely to affect
lower rated economies more heavily than higher rated ones, due to “flight to quality.” Based on
the Standard and Poor’s sovereign foreign currency credit rating in December 2007, we convert
the credit rating to a numerical scale where a value of 0 corresponds to a AAA-rating, 1 to a
AA+ rating, and so on, down to 12 for a BB- rating, the lowest in our sample.
The results are given in Table 2, and provide strong support for our argument that
financial flows were a significant causal factor in the propagation of the crisis, while trade
channels appear less important. First the export variables (X and CRX) are never economically or
statistically significant, and sometimes enter with the wrong sign. Second our measure of capital
flows (TIC) is statistically significant in all cases. Third, when we include an interactive term
between the credit rating and the size of capital inflows from the US, the interactive term enters
not only significantly, consistent with flight-to-quality, but the statistical support for TIC is also
further strengthened. Finally, the adjusted R-squared statistics are supportive of capital inflows
playing an important role in explaining the downturn, with trade channels being less important.
In summary, this evidence suggests that a financial channel may be important for the
international propagation of shocks. Moreover, it is difficult to explain the scale and
synchronicity of the global downturn based on trade alone.

3. The model
In this section we describe a basic two-country model with borrowers and lenders in each
country. The countries are called home and foreign. Within each country there are investors and
savers, both of whom use the same fixed asset and have infinite horizons. Investors purchase the
fixed asset and rent it to production firms, receiving a risky return in exchange. We may think of
this investment as the purchase of an equity claim in the production firm. Investors are more
impatient than savers, so they will borrow from savers in order to invest in the fixed asset.5

5

Because they are more impatient than savers, investors will never accumulate enough resources to cover the cost of
investment in any period.

12

Savers also make use of the fixed asset in home production. Savers therefore choose a portfolio
in which they hold the debt of investors and the fixed asset. Savers do not hold domestic or
foreign equity by assumption. We work with two versions of the model. In the first version
savers lend only to domestic investors, so there is no cross country trade in non-contingent
bonds. In the second version we allow for an open international bond market, so that investors
may borrow from either domestic or foreign savers.
Investors face leverage constraints. They issue debt, but the maximum amount they can
issue depends on their net worth. We will examine separately cases where these leverage
constraints are binding and non-binding.
Whether or not leverage constraints bind, investors in either country may have the
possibility of trading claims with investors in the other country so as to diversify their portfolio
of equity holdings. Thus investors in each country finance their investment with debt, but may
also have equity portfolios that are inter-connected across countries. Finally, both investors and
savers in each country supply labor inelastically to production firms, and there is no physical
capital accumulation. In section 6 we discuss how the model may be extended to accommodate
endogenous capital accumulation and variable labor supply.
The focus of the analysis is to explore the joint process of leverage constraints and
international portfolio integration in propagating macroeconomic shocks across countries.
Investors
We normalize the population of each country to unity, with a measure n of investors and

1  n of savers. The representative investor in the home country maximizes:


(1)

Et   sIU (CsI ) ,
s t

13

where CsI is consumption of the final good. To keep the analysis solely focused on financial
inter-linkages between countries, it is assumed that there is just one world good. Adding an
endogenous terms of trade to the analysis would enrich the response, but would not
fundamentally alter the cross-country transmission of balance sheet adjustments modeled here,
so long as the elasticity of substitution across home and foreign goods is not very close to unity.6
We define the discount factor for investors such that:

 sI1   I (CsI ) sI ,
with  I '(CsI )  0 where CsI is the economy-wide average consumption of investors. Thus the
rate of time preference of investors is increasing in consumption, but is taken as given by each
individual investor. The assumption of endogenous time preference for investors plays the usual
role of ensuring a stationary wealth distribution among groups, both within and across countries.
But it also plays a key role in allowing for a comparison of an economy in which leverage
constraints bind with one where they do not bind, as we discuss below.
Investors receive income from their current holdings of domestic and foreign equity, and
labor income from working in the domestic production firm. In addition, they must repay their
debts owed to domestic savers. They then issue new debt, purchase equity claims on home and
foreign investments and consume. The home country investor’s budget constraint is written as:
(2)

CtI  q1t k1It  q2t k 2It  Wt I  ( q1t  R1Kt ) k1It 1  ( q2t  R2 Kt ) k2It 1  BtI  Rt 1 BtI1 ,

6

As is well known, with an elasticity of substitution equal to unity, there is a high cross-country correlation of
consumption purely due to the risk sharing implications of a terms-of-trade adjustment. This is seen, for instance, in
the paper by Dedola and Lombardo (2009). Aghion et al. (2004) explore the importance of terms-of-trade
movements in affecting borrowing constraints in an emerging market economy framework. Extending our model to
a setting with an endogenous terms-of-trade would affect borrowing constraints through the impact of a terms-oftrade adjustment on net worth in a similar way to the effects of asset price changes in the present version of the
model.

14

where q1t and q2t represent the price of the fixed asset (or equity) in the home and foreign
country respectively, and k1It and k2It are the portfolio holdings of the fixed assets in each
country held by the home investor. The fixed asset of the home (foreign) country earns a
dividend of R1Kt ( R2Kt ). Wt I is wage income for the investor, who supplies one unit of labor.
Finally, BtI is the debt issued to domestic savers and Rt 1 BtI1 is payment on previously incurred
debt.
One may question why only investors can purchase the fixed assets, which are then used
by final goods firms. As in Bernanke et al. (1999), we could assume that investors (or, in their
model, entrepreneurs) have some special capability for transforming a unit of the fixed asset into
a usable factor of production that is rented to production firms. Savers cannot do this, and so may
gain only indirectly from the investment, by lending to the investors. Savers can use the fixed
asset only for use in home production, as described below.
In addition to constraint (2), investors face a constraint on total leverage due to an
inability to commit to repayment, as in Kiyotaki and Moore (1997). Total debt is assumed to be
restricted to be no greater than  times the market value of equity assets, where   1 . Thus
home investors’ choices are constrained by:
(3)

BtI   ( q1t k1It  q2t k2It ) .

The full leverage rate (the value of assets to capital) for investors is then 1 / (1   ) in the
case where the leverage constraint (3) is binding. Leverage constraints in the form of (3) have
been used quite widely in the literature on asset prices (Aiyagari and Gertler 1999), emerging
market crises (Mendoza and Smith 2006), borrowing in a small open economy (Uribe 2006) and
monetary policy with credit frictions in housing markets (Iacoviello, 2005). Kiyotaki and Moore

15

(1997) show that  may depend on the borrowing rate and expected capital gains on equity
under some circumstances. We assume that  is a fixed parameter in our analysis.
Investors in the home country choose a portfolio based on investments in the home equity
and the foreign equity, as well as their total borrowing and consumption, to maximize their
expected utility subject to their budget constraint (2) and leverage constraint (3), giving the
conditions:

where  is the multiplier on the leverage constraint. This may be interpreted as the shadow price

investor would like to borrow more, but is constrained by (3). Thus  is a measure of the value
of the opportunity to make a levered investment. To show this, put (4), (5) and (6) together to

return on the home equity and r2,t 1  (q2,t 1  R2 K ,t 1 ) / q2,t is the return on the foreign equity.
Equation (7) shows that, when   0 , the expected return on the portfolio, up to the first-order,
exceeds the cost of borrowing.

Note that the leverage constraint does not directly affect the investors’ incentive to
diversify equity across countries, since (3) applies equally to borrowing for domestic or foreign
equity purchases. Thus we may put (4) and (5) together to get the standard portfolio selection

Given that the portfolio choice may be written in the form (8), we can derive the optimal

discuss the details involved in portfolio choice more fully below.
Savers

Savers have preferences given by:

Et  sSU (CsS ) .
s t

As for investors, we define the discount factor such that  sS1   S (CsS ) sS , with  S '(CsI )  0 ,
where CsI is the economy-wide aggregate consumption of savers. Assume that savers are
inherently more ‘patient’ than investors, so that:
(10)

 S ( x)   I ( x) ,

for all feasible values of x . Assumption (10) ensures that savers will lend to investors, even in a
steady state where the leverage constraint (3) is not binding.7
Savers purchase the fixed asset, and buy debt from investors. They receive wage income
from working in the final goods sector, and returns on their lending to investors. In addition they

An alternative, but considerably more difficult, approach to achieving an equilibrium with levered investment is to
assume that investors are less risk averse than savers. Solving a model with leverage based on risk preferences
would necessitate using a higher order of approximation to the full stochastic model.

have a residual ‘home production function’ that uses the fixed asset.8 An individual saver owning

k1,St of the fixed asset produces G (k1,St ) in terms of home production, where G '(k1,St )  0 . For
simplicity, we assume that home production is perfectly substitutable with the final good in
savers’ utility.9 With this assumption, we may write the saver’s budget constraint as:
CtS  q1t k1St  Wt S  q1t k1St 1  G ( k1St 1 )  BtS  Rt 1 BtS1 .

(11)

Note that, by assumption, savers purchase only the domestic fixed asset. They do not
have access to the same investment opportunities as investors and therefore only have use for the
domestic fixed asset, as it may be utilized in home production. On the other hand, savers’
purchases of debt from investors are unconstrained.
The first-order conditions for the optimal choice of k1St and BtS are simply:
(q1t 1  G '(k1,St ))

Production firms

Production firms in each country hire labor and fixed assets in order to produce. Firms
are competitive, and maximize profits given the production function:
Yt  At F ( Lt , K t 1 ) ,

(14)

8

As in Kiyotaki and Moore (1997), we think of this fixed asset as being more productive when used to produce final
goods, and having a residual usage in home production for savers. According to this interpretation, savers do not
receive dividend income on the use of the fixed asset in home production, since this is paid only on the
‘transformed’ asset after its purchase by investors.

(16)

R1K ,t  At F2 ( Lt , K t 1 ) .

Equilibrium

Equilibrium of the two-country world economy entails market clearing for the world
market of the fixed asset, as well as equilibrium in the debt market. First take the case where
national debt markets are segmented, so that domestic investors borrow from domestic savers
only. Then, for the home economy, it must be the case that:
(17)

nBtI  (1  n) BtS  0 .

In the case where there is a common world bond market, (17) is replaced by
(17’)

n( BtI  BtI * )  (1  n)( BtS  BtS * )  0 .
For the home economy, equilibrium in the market for the fixed asset is defined as:

(18)

nk1,I t  nk1,*tI  (1  n)k1,St  1 ,

where k1,*tI represents foreign country investors’ real holdings of the home asset at the beginning
of time t  1 . In addition, the world market clearing condition must be satisfied:
n(CtI  Ct* I )  (1  n)(CtS  Ct*S )  At F (1, n(k1,I t 1  k1,*tI1 ))

(19)
 At* F (1, n(k2,I t 1  k2,*It 1 ))  (1  n)(G (k1,St 1 )  G ( k2,*St 1 )).

This condition incorporates the fact that the total labor supply of investors and savers sums to
unity, and total use of the fixed factor by final goods firms is equal to total holdings by domestic
and foreign investors.

19

We solve for four variants of the model and, in the process, conduct two experiments. We
first assume that bond markets are segmented across countries, but equity markets are integrated
internationally. We then solve separately for an equilibrium where the leverage constraint is
slack and when the leverage constraint is binding.10 Next we assume that international bond
markets are integrated across countries, so that there is one world interest rate on bonds and, in
addition, leverage constraints always bind. In this environment we contrast the properties of the
economy where equity markets are separated (no cross holdings of equity) with an environment
of full integration of equity markets (full portfolio diversification).
The first experiment allows us to explore the effects of leverage constraints in a global
economy where equity markets are integrated (although, as discussed below, we vary the degree
of diversification in this case). The second experiment allows us to explore the implications of
different forms of financial market integration in a global economy where leverage constraints
are binding in each country.
The equilibrium conditions may be characterized as follows. First, for the model with
segmented national bond markets, integrated equity markets and slack leverage constraints, the
full equilibrium is described by equations (2), (4)-(6), (11)-(13), (15)-(17) and (18) for both the
home and foreign country, and the world market clearing condition (19). This gives 23 equations
in the 22 variables CtI , CtS , Ct*I , Ct*S , k1,I t , k2,I t , k1,St , k1,*tI , k2,*It , k2,*St , BtI , BtS , Bt*I , Bt*S , q1,t , q2,t ,
Rt , Rt* , Wt , Wt * , R1K ,t and R2 K ,t , with one equation redundant by Walras’ law (note that in this
case, because leverage constraints never bind, we have t  t*  0 ). In the case where leverage
constraints always bind, the full equilibrium is described by equations (2)-(6), (11)-(13), (15)-

10

The solution approach we use does not allow us to accommodate an outcome with ‘occasionally binding’ leverage
constraints.

20

(17) and (18) for both the home and foreign country, and the world market clearing condition
(19). This gives 25 equations in the 24 variables CtI , CtS , Ct*I , Ct*S , k1,I t , k2,I t , k1,St , k1,*tI , k2,*It ,
k2,*St , BtI , BtS , Bt*I , Bt*S , q1,t , q2,t , Rt , Rt* , t , t* , Wt , Wt * , R1K ,t and R2 K ,t , with one equation

redundant by Walras’ law.
In the case with a common world bond market, leverage constraints and segmented
international equity markets, we have conditions (2)-(4), (6), (11)-(13), (15)-(16) and (18) for the
home country, and analogous expressions for the foreign country, while condition (17) for each
country is replaced by the single condition (17’) which, in conjunction with (19), gives us 22
equations in 21 variables CtI , CtS , Ct*I , Ct*S , k1,I t , k1,St , k2,*It , k2,*St , BtI , BtS , Bt*I , Bt*S , q1,t , q2,t ,
Rt , t , t* , Wt , Wt * , R1K ,t and R2 K ,t .11 Finally, in the case with a common world bond market,
leverage constraints and integrated world equity markets, we add condition (5) to the previous
list for the home country, along with its analogue for the foreign country, and we now solve for
two additional variables, k2,I t and k1,*tI .
Although this fully describes the set of equilibrium conditions and endogenous variables
for each version of the model, the solution method involves taking a linear approximation around
a non-stochastic steady state version of each model. In this case, a well-known difficulty arises
due to the problem of determining the portfolio holdings of investors in a non-stochastic steady
state. In particular, if equity markets are integrated and both assets are to be held by investors,
equilibrium must be characterized by indifference among investors, at the margin, between
holdings of home and foreign equities. This implies that, in a non-stochastic steady state, the
assets must command identical returns, and there is no unique optimal portfolio share for an

Note that in this case there are no international cross-holdings of equity.

investor. But using the method of Devereux and Sutherland (2010a), the characteristics of the
equilibrium portfolio may be approximated. The method allows for a derivation of the zero-order
(or steady state) component of the equilibrium portfolio using a second order approximation of
the portfolio selection equation, in conjunction with a first order approximation of the remaining
parts of the model. This approximation gives us the degree to which investors in each country
will choose to be exposed to equity markets in the other country, and allows an analysis of the
stochastic equilibrium of the first-order approximation to the model with integrated world equity
markets.12
It is important to emphasize that this indeterminacy of portfolio shares up to a first order
approximation applies only to the choice of home and foreign equity conditional on the
allocation of the fixed asset between the final goods sector and the home production sector in
each country. This allocation itself, giving the total supply of equity, denoted by kˆ1,I t  k1,I t  k1,*tI
for the home economy and kˆ2,I t  k2,I t  k2,* It for the foreign economy, is clearly determinate in a
non-stochastic steady state, as evidenced by equations (19) (for the case without leverage
constraints) or (20) (for the case with leverage constraints). Thus, the total supply of equity is
determinate in a steady state, but the ownership pattern must be obtained using higher order
approximations. In the impulse responses discussed below, we report the dynamics of total
equity, which can be obtained from a simple linear approximation, rather than the dynamics of
the investors’ equity portfolios (which would require a second order approximation to the model
as described in Devereux and Sutherland (2010b)).
Properties of the steady state

12

This aspect of the solution method is described in more detail in an appendix available from the authors.

22

Before examining the dynamics of balance sheet adjustments within the model, we first
discuss some properties of the non-stochastic steady state. Since the model is symmetric and
there is a stationary wealth distribution, the steady state is identical in the two types of bond
market arrangements.
When leverage constraints do not bind, it follows from a combination of (4) and (6),
together with (12), (13) and (16), that the fixed asset is allocated efficiently between the final
good sector and home production. That is, for the home economy, we have:
(20)

G '(k1S )  AF2 (1, nkˆ1I ) ,

Where nkˆ1I represents the total quantity of the fixed asset used in the final goods production
sector and kˆ1I  k1I  k1* I . Thus the marginal product of the fixed asset is equalized between home
production and final goods production.
In combination with the resource constraint nkˆ1I  (1  n ) k1S  1 , this uniquely determines
the allocation of assets in final goods production. Therefore there is no interdependence across
countries in asset allocation in steady state when leverage constraints do not bind. In fact, we can
extend this result further. In the case where leverage constraints never bind it is easy to see that
there is no interaction between asset allocations across countries at all, at least up to a first-order
approximation. This can be seen by taking a linear approximation of (4), (6), (12), (13) and (16)
to obtain the condition:

1

dk1,St 1
k1S

 Et

dkˆ I
dAt 1
  2 1,It 1 ,
A
kˆ1

where  1 and  2 are constant coefficients. Hence the dynamic paths of asset allocations are
independent across countries, despite the fact that, up to a first-order, expected returns on all
assets are equalized both within and across countries.
23

A more general feature of this environment is that the degree of financial integration does
not affect the allocation of real assets. That is, allocation of the fixed asset between home
production and investment in the final good is independent of the ownership of equities. This
property does not hold in an economy with binding leverage constraints.13
When leverage constraints bind, we again use (4), (6), (12), (13) and (16) to obtain the
steady state condition:
(21)

G '(k1S ) 

 I (1   S )
AF2 ( L, nkˆ1I ) .
S
I
S
I
 (1   )   (   )

From condition (3) it must be true that  I (1   S ) / [  S (1   I )   (  S   I )]  1 . It
follows that, under binding leverage constraints, the final goods sector has an inefficiently low
level of the fixed asset. More generally, however, since discount factors are endogenous, the
allocation of fixed assets across sectors will no longer be independent across countries. With free
trade in equities across countries, returns to investors must be equal in both countries. Since
returns interact with movements in consumption through the endogenous rate of time preference,
(21) shows that the division of resources between home production and final goods must be
linked across countries as well. Even in the case of constant time preference, however, the
presence of leverage constraints would still imply a dynamic interaction between output levels
across countries, because productivity shocks to one country will affect the tightness of leverage
constraints across all financial markets. We explore this in detail below.
Portfolio choice

13

In a more general model with endogenous capital accumulation and variable labor supply, the degree of financial
integration will affect business cycle correlations across countries. As discussed in the introduction, however,
financial integration generally reduces the co-movement of business cycles across countries in the standard model
(Heathcote and Perri 2004). The main point here is to show that the presence of balance sheet constraints introduces
substantial forces for positive cross-country correlations that would otherwise be absent. In section 6 below, we
discuss how the results extend to a model with capital accumulation and endogenous labor supply.

24

Equations (20) or (21) determine the steady state allocation of the fixed asset in final
goods production, with non-binding or binding leverage constraints respectively. This determines
the total supply of equity in each country. But the share of each country’s equity held by home
and foreign investors (the portfolio shares k1I and k1* I ) must also be determined. Clearly, in order
to analyze the dynamic response to productivity shocks in one country, it is necessary to
understand the pattern of equity holdings of investors in each country. To do this we follow
Devereux and Sutherland (2010a) in using a second-order expansion of (8) to obtain an
approximation of optimal portfolio holdings.14
In practice it is convenient to rewrite the model to determine the net international equity
position of each country. Since only investors have access to equity markets by assumption, it is
sufficient to look at the portfolio decisions of home and foreign investors. First take the budget
constraint for home country investors (2). This may be rewritten as:
(22)

CtI  NFAt  Wt I  R1Kt kˆ1It 1  q1t (kˆ1It  kˆ1It 1 )  r2t NFAt 1  rxt  q1t 1 (k1It 1  kˆ1It 1 )   BtI  Rt 1 BtI1 ,



where NFAt denotes net foreign assets, defined as NFAt  q2t k2It  q1t (kˆ1It  k1It ) , which is the
excess of the home investors’ holdings of foreign equity relative to foreign investors’ holdings of
domestic equity. In addition, rxt is the ex-post excess return on the portfolio:

 q  R1K ,t
rxt  r1t  r2t   1t
 q1t 1

  q2t  R2 K ,t

  q2t 1


.


For given NFAt , the portfolio choice may be described as the choice of  t  q1t 1 (k1It 1  kˆ1It 1 ) ,
which is the net holding of home country equity by home agents. If  t  0 , the investors
diversify in the sense that less than 100 percent of all home equity is owned by home investors.

14

A detailed description of the solution approach is contained in an appendix available from the authors.

25

Given NFAt , home investors’ holdings of foreign equity are equal to NFAt   t and equation (22)
is the only part of the model where the portfolio term  t enters. But it is still necessary to obtain
a solution for  t in order to characterize how equity markets affect international transmission.
Devereux and Sutherland (2010a) show that, when the properties of the model are analyzed up to
a first-order approximation,  t is a constant and is determined by a combination of a secondorder approximation of (8), together with a first-order approximation of the rest of the model.15
In the solution below, following Tille and van Wincoop (2007), we extend (8) to allow
for transactions costs of international financial trade that effectively limit international portfolio
diversification. This represents a brute-force technique for generating home equity bias. In
particular, we assume that an ‘iceberg’ cost factor given by exp(  )  1 reduces the returns that
home investors receive from foreign investment so that condition (8) becomes:
(8’)

 (q  R ) (q  R2 Kt 1 )

EtU '(CtI1 )  1t 1 1Kt 1  2t 1
exp( )   0 .
q1t
q2t



In addition, we follow Tille and Van Wincoop in assuming that  is a small, second-order term.
This means that while it does affect the solution for the equilibrium portfolio, which is evaluated
using a second-order approximation of (8’), it does not impact on the first-order dynamics of the
model, except insofar as it affects the choice of the portfolio itself.
Note that given the definition of net foreign assets, the leverage constraint for home
country investors may be written:
(23)
15

Bt   ( NFAt  q1t kˆ1It ) .

Note that the constant approximation for  t is the only aspect of the portfolio solution that is explicitly

incorporated in the model. Given this approximation, all other aspects of the model can be analyzed using a first
order approximation, including the dynamics of total equity (the part of the fixed asset invested in final goods
production). As emphasized above, in order to compute the dynamics of the ownership of equity (the dynamics
of  t ), it would be necessary to solve the model using a higher order of approximation.

26

Thus, holding home asset prices constant, an increase in net foreign assets generated by either a
current account surplus or a capital gain on the external portfolio (i.e. valuation effects) will
loosen the leverage constraint. But since NFAt  NFAt*  0 , this will simultaneously tighten the
leverage constraint facing foreign investors. Therefore the degree to which leverage linkages
govern the transmission of shocks across countries depends on the dynamics of net foreign
assets, and these in turn are linked to the portfolio choices made by home and foreign investors.
Calibration

Because this version of the model is such a stripped-down representation of a full-scale
DSGE framework, lacking capital accumulation and dynamics in labor supply and containing
only a single world good, there are many dimensions in which the model’s predictions will
depart from reality. The aim of the exercise is solely to explore the way in which the interaction
of leverage constraints and portfolio interdependence affect the cross-country dynamics of asset
prices, asset allocations and levered investments. To do this, however, we need to choose
parameter values for preferences, production technologies and the leverage constraint itself.
Table 3 gives the set of parameter values used in the baseline model.

We assume that the measure of investors and savers is equal, so that n  0.5 . In the
leverage constrained economy, this accords with the estimates of Campbell and Mankiw (1990)
regarding the share of households that are subject to credit constraints in the US economy.
In the model with binding leverage constraints, total leverage (investment relative to
capital) is equal to 1 / (1   ) . The leverage ratio has a significant effect on the quantitative
dynamics. We examine two alternatives. First we choose a relatively low ratio of 2 (   0.5 ), as
in Bernanke and Gertler (1999). But, given the high rates of leverage seen in the financial system
in recent years, we also explore the implications of a higher value of   0.75 , corresponding to
total leverage of 4. While the impact of shocks is greater for higher leverage (when the leverage
constraint is binding), qualitatively the results are similar for both leverage ratios.
We assume a discount factor defined as:

 i (C )   i (1  C )  , i  I , S .
Following Mendoza (2006), we set   0.022 . We choose  for savers to match an annual
interest rate of 4 percent, and the value of  for investors so that, in a steady state with binding
leverage constraints, investors face a shadow price of borrowing that effectively imposes an
interest premium on borrowed funds of two percentage points, which requires that  I  0.955 .16

This follows the calibration of the borrowing premium in Bernanke et al. (1999).
In the model without leverage constraints, it is necessary to use a different approach to
calibrate the discount factor. In that case, we choose  S and  I jointly to match a steady state
annual interest rate of 4 percent and to ensure that borrowing by investors is such that the
leverage ratio matches that of the economy with binding leverage constraints. In the

16

 I  .975 .
We assume a Cobb-Douglas final goods production technology, and let F ( L, K )  L1 K  .
We set   0.36 , the conventional measure of the share of capital in US GDP.17 Regarding the
home production sector, we assume that G  Z (k1S ) and   0.1 , implying that the fixed asset
is less important in this sector.18 We set A  Z  1 in steady state. The combination of these
assumptions and other calibrated parameters implies that, in steady state, 80 percent of the fixed
asset is employed in final goods production.
We follow the standard business cycle literature in setting an elasticity of intertemporal
substitution equal to 0.5, so that   2 in U (C )  C1 / (1   ) . Alternative values of  change
the volatility of asset prices, but have little qualitative effect on the results otherwise.
What are the appropriate shocks to focus on? While the recent crisis has raised awareness
of shocks to the financial system, our model lacks any detailed financial structure. It is not easy
to pinpoint any key crisis-generating shock within the model. Instead, we follow the standard
macro-RBC literature and look at the international propagation of productivity shocks in the final
goods sector. The stochastic process for final goods productivity is modeled as:
(24)

log( At )   log( At 1 )  t ,

17

In order to have substantial propagation effects from leverage constraints, Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) require that
production in the borrowing sector is linear in the fixed asset. Kocherlakota (2000) shows that, with a more
conventional calibration allowing for decreasing returns, credit constraints have much less impact. Cordoba and
Ripoll (2004) extend the Kocherlakota analysis to a general equilibrium, two sector economy similar to ours. They
show that borrowing constraints of the type used in Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) impart little amplitude to the effect
of shocks on total output unless sectors differ substantially in the share of capital in production. Our interpretation
differs from theirs by focusing on the distinction between the final goods sector and a home production sector. In
addition, our main focus is not on amplification per se, but on the impact of leverage constraints and portfolio
integration on the international transmission of shocks. Our results, showing that these two features enhance the
international transmission of shocks, still obtain under the alternative interpretation that aggregate output is the sum
of output from both sectors.

Benhabib et al. (1991) calibrate the share of capital in home production equal to 0.08.

where   0.9 , Et 1t  0 and  2  0.022 . We assume that foreign productivity is driven by the
same process, and foreign and domestic productivity shocks are uncorrelated.

4. The effects of leverage constraints on international transmission

In this section we compare the impact of a productivity shock in one country in an
environment where leverage constraints are absent with that where investors in both countries
are subject to binding leverage constraints. In both cases we assume that investors have
diversified equity portfolios, potentially constrained only by second-order iceberg costs of capital
flows, as described in (8’). The iceberg cost  is set so as to ensure that domestic investors hold
75 percent of the home equity portfolio. We will also examine the case without these costs, so
that investors have fully diversified equity portfolios. In addition, this section focuses on the case
where national bond markets are segmented. Section 5 below analyzes the case with a single
world bond market.
No leverage constraints

Figures 3 and 4 describe the impact of a one percent negative productivity shock in the
home country, when the leverage constraint is not binding, relaxing (3). The figures describe the
response of total consumption of final goods,19 asset prices, investor borrowing, asset allocation,
the home country trade surplus and the internal lending rate in each country. Figure 3 represents
the case where portfolio diversification is restricted by second-order transactions costs, as
described above. Investors in the home country then choose values for k1I and k 2I to satisfy (8’),
evaluated up to second-order, where the parameter  has been chosen so that home investors
hold 75 percent of home equity ( k1I  .75kˆ1I ).
19

We define total consumption of final goods as nCt  (1  n )(Ct  G ( k t )) .

Impulse responses of a one percent negative productivity shock when the leverage constraint is assumed to not bind

Figure 4 describes the case of unrestricted portfolios. In this case, the choices of k1I and k 2I
satisfy (8). This involves home investors having a bias against home equities. Since investors are
exposed to non-diversifiable risk from wage income, and wages are positively correlated with the
return on home equity, they will hedge this risk by taking a larger position in foreign equity than
home equity, as noted by Baxter and Jehrmann (1997).
A fall in At causes an immediate fall in current output in the home country and
temporarily reduces wages for both savers and investors. This would lead both savers and
investors to increase their desired borrowing at the initial interest rates, so that net saving falls. If
there was no cross-country equity trade, real interest rates would have to rise sufficiently so as to
ensure that net saving equals zero. At the same time, the direct fall in the return on the fixed asset
would lead investors to reduce their demand for this asset, leading to a reduction in withincountry borrowing of investors from savers, and precipitating a fall in the asset price. This fall in
the asset price would lead savers to purchase more of the fixed asset. Thus, without international
equity trade, adjustment would involve higher real interest rates, a lower asset price and a lower
share of the fixed asset in the final goods sector, with all these variables gradually returning to
their initial steady state.
In the two-country world economy with equity trade, the adjustment process is facilitated
by the immediate valuation effects on home country net foreign assets, and the subsequent
dynamics in net foreign assets due to changes in equity holdings. The international transmission
of the shock to consumption depends on the degree of portfolio diversification, and the
movement in asset returns. The home country has a negative net position in its own stock
(  t  q1t 1 (k1It 1  kˆ1It 1 )  0 ). Since asset returns must be equalized, up to a first order, the fall in
asset prices in the home economy leads to a fall in the foreign asset price. But the ex-post excess

33

return on home assets immediately following the shock is negative ( rxt  0 ), and the combination
of this and the home country’s portfolio position ensures that the home country receives a
positive portfolio valuation effect. In fact, with fully unrestricted diversification, foreign
investors are more exposed to home equity, and suffer a bigger valuation loss on their portfolio,
than home investors because home asset prices fall by more than foreign asset prices. Thus the
home and foreign consumption responses in Figure 4 are more alike than in Figure 3, because
there is more portfolio diversification among investors.
The subsequent adjustment in the two-country world economy is characterized by the
home economy running a persistent trade deficit. This is financed by home country investors
reducing their holdings of both home and foreign equities over time, and foreign country
investors increasing their holdings of both equities. Since world real interest rates are higher
following the shock, the foreign country as a whole increases its savings rate to absorb the
greater holdings of equity.
The key feature of both Figures 3 and 4, however, is that there the shock does not affect
the allocation of the fixed asset in the foreign country.20 Since the foreign asset allocation is
governed by (20) up to a first order, optimal investment is unaffected by the shock to home
productivity. This means that there is no fall in lending between foreign savers and foreign
investors. In fact, within-country borrowing in the foreign country rises, moving in the opposite
direction to that in the home country.21 In this sense, there is no international transmission of
balance sheet contractions.

20

Again, we note that in this and subsequent figures, the asset dynamics refer to total equity in each country (or
I
I
equivalently, the shares of the fixed asset in the final goods sectors) kˆ1,t and kˆ2,t , rather than the division of this

equity between the portfolios of home and foreign investors.
21
In fact, since foreign lenders do not interact with home agents, foreign investors are effectively borrowing from
foreign lenders in order to purchase more home and foreign equity during the transition. In the home country, the

34

In the economy without leverage constraints, then, the international transmission of
shocks is limited, and clearly counterfactual, relative to the discussion of the empirical evidence
of financial spillovers in section 2. A negative productivity shock in the home country leads to
balance sheet contractions domestically as investors reduce both their borrowing and holdings of
fixed assets. But there are no foreign balance sheet contractions. Equity portfolio integration
allows for the consumption effects of productivity shocks to be diversified across countries, but
it does not in itself influence the real effects of the shock on investment and output.22
Leverage constraints and international transmission

The impact of a negative productivity shock in the home country, when leverage
constraints bind in both countries, is shown in Figures 5-7. Figures 5 and 6 illustrate the case
where the leverage ratio is 4, the former when investors’ portfolios are only partly diversified
due to the presence of transactions costs and the latter with unrestricted portfolio diversification.
As before, the fall in home country productivity leads to a fall in asset prices in both
countries and, through the valuation effects of ex-post asset return differentials between the
home and foreign portfolios, to an increase in net foreign assets for the home country, and a fall
in investors’ consumption in both countries. But in this environment asset prices have a
secondary effect, beyond the wealth redistribution channel, through the return on portfolios. The
fall in asset prices leads to a tightening of the leverage constraint in both the home and foreign
countries. For the home country, the fall in q1t leads to a fall in net worth and, for given NFA,
requires a reduction in borrowing. With a diversified portfolio, however, the shock also generates
a valuation effect, causing a compensating rise in NFA. But this leads to negative movement in
dynamic is the opposite – home investors reduce their borrowing from home savers (at least initially), financed by
sales of equity to foreign investors.
22
Again, we note that, with endogenous labour supply and capital accumulation, the degree of portfolio
diversification would impact on the international transmission of shocks, but this would generally imply negative
transmission.

35

foreign NFA, and a tightening of the foreign leverage constraint, also requiring a reduction in
borrowing in the foreign country. The result is a reduction in borrowing by investors in both
countries, and a consequent reduction in investment in fixed assets in the final goods sector.
Thus Figure 5 illustrates that foreign investment falls sharply, by the same order of magnitude as
home investment. Note that, for the foreign country, there is no fall in the productivity of the
domestic final goods sector. Despite that, there is a fall in investment in final goods in the
foreign country. This fall in investment takes place purely through balance sheet linkages.
The positive relationship between the movement in an asset price and demand for this
asset represents the essence of the ‘upward sloping demand curve’ for assets that characterizes
episodes of balance sheet contractions forced by binding leverage constraints (see, for instance,
Aiyagari and Gertler 1999). Here it is taking place as a spillover from one levered investor to
another, as emphasized by Krugman (2008). That is, a fall in the price of the asset held by one
investor leads to a tightening of leverage constraints and a fall in demand for both the original
asset and other assets held in the investor’s portfolio.
Even in the case where portfolios are only partly diversified (Figure 5), there is a high
correlation across countries in borrowing and investment. The balance sheet contraction is so
great that the interest rate on debt in each country immediately falls. Again, note that this is in
response to a temporary shock so that future consumption of investors is expected to increase.
But because investors are subject to leverage constraints, the path of their consumption is delinked from the path of interest rates.

Since consumption falls for both home and foreign investors, but is expected to rise in the future,
real interest rates would tend to rise in an unrestricted environment.23 But this effect is more than
offset by the increase in the shadow price of borrowing due to the leverage constraint. This leads
to a large fall in the supply of debt to savers, and a fall in market real interest rates.
There is a distinct difference in this model between the constrained and unconstrained
economy, not just in the direction of the international transmission of shocks, but also in the
scale of the effects. In the unconstrained economy, not only is there an absence of international
transmission via balance sheet contractions, but the domestic impact of the shock is also
relatively mild. A one percent decline in final goods’ sector productivity leads only to an
approximately 0.25 percent reduction in fixed asset investment. By contrast, the response of the
constrained economy is an order of magnitude larger. Domestic investment in fixed assets falls
by 1.7 percent. Even in the foreign economy the effect of the shock is very large – investment
falls by 1.3 percent. In both countries, the response to the shock is proportionally much larger
than the shock itself, due to the interaction between asset price declines and binding leverage
constraints. Consumption also falls by slightly more in the constrained economy than in the
unconstrained economy, although this decline is less persistent.
When portfolio diversification is unrestricted, Figure 6 shows that the international
transmission of the shocks is heightened further. In fact, we get the surprising prediction that the
size of the balance sheet contraction and disinvestment is greater in the foreign country than in
the home country! Investment in the foreign economy falls by 1.6 percent, but only 1.2 percent
in the domestic economy.
23

There is not a strict relationship between expected consumption growth and real interest rates, up to a first-order,
due to the presence of endogenous time preference. Nevertheless, since the time preference parameter  is very
small, for practical purposes the consumption growth-real interest rate linkage holds quite closely in the model. Note
also that, because interest rate movements are non-monotonic, the same will (approximately) hold for the nonborrowing constrained savers in each country.

39

Why does greater portfolio diversification magnify the international propagation effects
of the shock? The reason is clear from (3) or (23). Increased diversification leads to a greater
sensitivity of foreign balance sheets to the domestic asset price, and therefore a larger balance
sheet contraction in response to a negative shock to home productivity. In the completely
unrestricted portfolio equilibrium (when   0 ), the foreign country is over-weighted in home
equity as part of an optimal risk sharing arrangement. So the macroeconomic reverberations of
the shock are greater in the foreign country than the domestic country, despite the fact that the
actual shock takes place only in the home economy. Thus, in this example, the ownership pattern
of equity holdings, through its implication for balance sheet constraints, is more important for the
business cycle response than is the geographical source of macro shocks.
Figure 7 shows the results with a lower degree of leverage (equal to 2), when portfolio
diversification is restricted by transactions costs (the case of full diversification is very similar
and is omitted for brevity). Qualitatively the results are very similar, although the amplification
effect of shocks is lower when leverage is smaller. The presence of binding leverage constraints
still generates a high positive co-movement in borrowing and real investment between countries.

5. Portfolio Integration and international transmission

In this section we examine the version of the model that allows for an integrated world
market for non-contingent bonds. Now investors may borrow at the same interest rate from either
domestic or foreign savers. We use this version to explore the impact of equity market
integration in the presence of leverage constraints. That is, in contrast to the previous section
where we compared the effects of a productivity shock assuming integrated equity markets (to a
greater or lesser degree, depending on the value of  ), both with and without leverage
constraints, here we assume that leverage constraints are always binding, but we contrast the case
with and without equity market integration.24
Figure 8 illustrates the impact of a shock to productivity in the home country in the model
with a common bond market, but without equity market integration. In this environment, the
transmission of macroeconomic shocks across countries is negative!25

24

This was not possible in the previous section because, absent equity market integration, the two countries were
effectively in autarky, since bond markets were segmented by country. We note also that Dedola and Lombardo
(2009) look at various degrees of portfolio integration.
25
We focus only on the high leverage case here. The impact of portfolio integration in the case with lower leverage
is qualitatively similar, in the sense that portfolio integration increases macroeconomic co-movement when
compared with the economy without equity market integration. However, in the economy without integration and
lower leverage (the counterpart of Figure 8), the co-movement is likely to be positive rather than negative since a
negative productivity shock will tend to raise rather than lower world lending rates with low leverage. Thus the case
of negative co-movement depends on both the absence of portfolio integration and high levels of leverage.
Nevertheless, the main result that follows – that equity market integration increases macroeconomic co-movement –
remains even with low leverage.

43

As before, a decline in home country productivity reduces investment, borrowing and
aggregate consumption in the home economy. But because the borrowing rate is identical in both
countries, and the fall in the demand for funds on the part of home investors pushes down the
borrowing rate, the demand for funds in the foreign country rises, increasing borrowing and
investment in the fixed asset by foreign investors. Foreign total consumption rises, as the fall in
interest rates encourages an increase in spending, and the rise in foreign investment increases
production of final goods in the foreign country. In contrast to the case without an integrated
world bond market, the home country’s trade balance now moves into surplus, rather than
deficit.
The different responses of home and foreign investment lead asset prices to move in
opposite directions in the two countries. There is an asset price decline in the home country, for
the same reasons as before. In the foreign country, by contrast, the increase in demand for the
fixed asset raises the price of that asset. Thus the end result is that consumption, investment, and
asset prices move in opposite directions in the two countries when there is an integrated world
bond market but no equity market integration. Notice also that the amplification effects of the
shock on domestic investment and asset prices are substantially bigger in this case than in
Figures 5 or 6. Because equity prices across countries are not directly related through arbitrage,
home country asset prices fall by more, and the impact on the leverage constraint is amplified,
relative to the case with equity market integration.
Figure 9 now takes the same shock, but allows for both bond and equity market
integration, assuming unrestricted equity holdings (the case with iceberg costs on equity returns
is very similar, and is omitted for brevity). In this case there is a clear positive co-movement
across countries. Qualitatively, the transmission is similar to Figures 5 and 6, except now there is

44

a single world debt market. The shock leads to a fall in the price of the home asset and, from
arbitrage condition (8), the foreign asset price also falls. Given the hedged portfolio position of
the home country, the fall in the return on the home asset leads to an increase in home NFA due
to valuation effects. For the foreign country these valuation effects are negative, leading to a
tightening of the leverage constraint on foreign investors. As in Figures 5 and 6, total borrowing,
investment and consumption fall in both countries. The world real interest rate on debt also falls,
as the demand for borrowing by both home and foreign investors declines.
A comparison between Figures 8 and 9 illustrates that, conditional on leverage
constrained investment, portfolio integration itself causes a dramatic qualitative shift in the
international transmission of productivity shocks. Absent equity market integration, shocks are
transmitted negatively to consumption, asset prices and investment. There would thus be a clear
incentive to diversify country specific risk through equity market integration. But integrating
equity markets in the presence of binding leverage constraints causes a sharp change in the
nature of international transmission itself. Without leverage constraints, as we have seen, there
would be no such effects. Real investment would be entirely independent across countries in this
basic model, and opening up financial markets in equity trade would have no effect on comovement whatsoever, aside from the direct effect on consumption risk-sharing. But with
binding leverage constraints, portfolio diversification leads to large shifts in net worth across
countries in response to country-specific shocks. These net worth changes interact with leverage
constraints to cause highly synchronized movements in investment demand across countries.
Thus, the ex-post gains to diversification, after financial integration, are diminished relative to
ex-ante ‘perceived’ gains from equity market integration.

Impulse responses of a one percent negative productivity shock with a high, binding leverage constraint

(   0.75 ), integrated bond markets ( Rt  Rt ) and integrated equity markets with complete portfolio diversification
*

(   0 ).

Equivalently we can observe that, while financial integration through equity markets
allows for a positive gain from cross country risk-sharing, it also generates a ‘contagion’ effect in
the presence of leverage constraints on investment. This contagion effect works through crosscountry changes in net worth, affecting investment and increasing the degree of macroeconomic
co-movement relative to that which would obtain in the absence of portfolio integration.
Unconditional moments

Table 4 reports the unconditional moments of the model under the assumption that
productivity shocks in both countries follow identical but uncorrelated distributions, given by
(24). As is evident from the figures, the model with binding leverage constraints displays
substantially more overall volatility than the model where leverage constraints are absent.
Aggregate consumption is 50 percent more volatile with high leverage constraints. Asset price
volatility is relatively unchanged with and without leverage constraints, but investment volatility
is vastly higher, as is clear from a comparison of Figures 3 and 5. Investment is essentially
uncorrelated across countries in the economy without leverage constraints, but almost perfectly
correlated in the economy with leverage constraints. Table 4 therefore underscores the main
message of the paper. In the presence of credit market imperfections, balance sheet linkages
across financial institutions can generate a very powerful mechanism for the international
transmission of business cycle shocks. The table also shows that, in the presence of leverage
constraints, international portfolio diversification can lead to a dramatic change in macroeconomic co-movement. The cross-country correlations of consumption, asset prices and
investment switch from negative to positive when equity markets are opened and leverage
constraints are binding. Note, however, that overall macro volatility is still substantially reduced
by financial integration, as suggested by Figure 9.

6. Extending the model: endogenous capital accumulation and labor supply

The paper has stressed the joint effects of leverage constraints and international portfolio
integration in generating positive international co-movement in macro aggregates. The key
mechanisms are based on interdependence in balance sheets and the magnification effects of
asset price shocks in face of leverage constraints. The model lacks many of the standard features

48

of the international real business cycle (IRBC) literature, however. In particular, labor supply of
both investors and savers is assumed to be inelastic, and there is no endogenous physical capital
accumulation. A natural question to ask is whether the forces for positive macro co-movement
outlined in the basic model extend to a full IRBC environment. In an interesting recent paper,
Faia (2007) provides some relevant results. She explores the role of financial integration in
DSGE framework where financial frictions in the manner of Bernanke et al. (2000) are present.
Her results show that these financial frictions lead to a greater synchronization of international
business cycles.
Exploring the full implications of the leverage constraints and portfolio diversification
channels for international business cycles is beyond the scope of the present paper. However,
Devereux Sutherland and Yetman (2010) extend the basic model to a richer international
business cycle environment, incorporating endogenous labor supply, reproducible capital
accumulation and quadratic adjustment costs of investment, in conjunction with the channels of
portfolio diversification and leverage constraints described above. Under this extension, the
general features of the results described above continue to hold. In particular, the presence of
leverage constraints generates an ‘international finance multiplier’ which tends to reverse the
sign of the international macro-transmission of shocks. Nevertheless, a large number of questions
remain unanswered – in particular pertaining to the role of financial shocks relative to real
shocks, the comparison of different types of financial frictions and the role for financial
intermediaries in the international propogation of shocks.
In some ways investors in our model may be thought to parallel the banking system. In
the model investors borrow money from savers and use this to invest in fixed assets, which might
be thought of as similar to the way in which the banking system intermediates between deposits

49

and loans. Also, the downturn in our model, amplified by leverage constraints, might be seen as
similar to the debt deflation and balance sheet deterioration within the banking system which
operated during the financial crisis. However, the analogy to financial institutions is not perfect.
For example, there is no maturity transformation in our model, which is a distinguishing feature
of the banking system. In addition, whereas it is generally assumed that banks lend to
entrepreneurs who then undertake investment projects, here the investors themselves take equity
stakes in the capital projects.

5. Conclusions

This paper has provided empirical evidence on the importance of balance sheet adjustments in
propagating business cycle shocks across countries. Financial interdependence, combined with
financial vulnerabilities, can open a channel for the transmission of shocks that may be as
important as standard trade linkages. We have used this evidence to motivate a simple twocountry model in which highly levered financial institutions hold inter-connected portfolios, and
may be limited in their investment activity by capital constraints. The combination of portfolio
inter-dependence and capital constraints leads a negative shock in one country to precipitate an
episode of global balance sheet contractions and disinvestment. In this sense our model may be
seen as a formal general equilibrium representation of Krugman (2008) who suggests that interconnections in financial markets may give rise to an ‘international finance multiplier.’ In our
model we find that, with high initial levels of leverage, the global effects of the shock may be
substantially magnified. While the model illustrates the importance of financial connections, it
abstracts away from trade inter-linkages. In a more elaborate model, it would be desirable to
quantitatively investigate the relative importance of the two separate channels.
