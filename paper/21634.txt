ABSTRACT
This paper assesses whether legal systems that protect outside investors from corporate insiders increase
or decrease the rate of technological innovation. Based on over 75,000 industry-country-year observations
across 94 economies from 1976 to 2006, we find that enforcing insider trading laws spurs innovation—as
measured by patent intensity, scope, impact, generality, and originality. Consistent with theories that
insider trading slows innovation by impeding the valuation of innovative activities, the relationship
between enforcing insider trading laws and innovation is much larger in industries that are naturally
innovative and opaque, and equity issuances also rise much more in these industries after a country
starts enforcing its insider trading laws.

1. Introduction
The finance and growth literature emphasizes that financial markets shape economic
growth primarily by boosting productivity growth (e.g., King and Levine, 1993a, b, Levine
and Zervos, 1998, Rajan and Zingales, 1998, Beck et al., 2000 and Levine, 2005), and this
literature has recently found a strong link between finance and the rate of technological
innovation (Amore et al., 2013, Chava et al., 2013, Fang et al., 2014, Hsu et al., 2014,
Acharya and Xu, 2015 and Laeven et al., 2015). Partially motivated by research on finance
and growth, the law and finance literature stresses that legal systems that protect the voting
rights of minority shareholders and limit the ability of large shareholders and executives to
expropriate corporate resources through self-dealing transactions enhance financial markets
(e.g., La Porta et al., 1997, 1998, 2002, 2006 and Djankov et al., 2008). What these literatures
have not yet addressed is whether legal systems that protect outside investors from corporate
insiders influence a crucial source of economic growth—technological innovation. In this
paper, we focus on one such protection. We examine whether restrictions on insider
trading—trading by corporate officials, major shareholders, or others based on material nonpublic information—influences technological innovation.
Theory offers differing perspectives on whether restricting insider trading would
accelerate or slow innovation. One set of theories suggests that restricting insider trading
enhances the valuation of and hence improves investments in technological innovation. This
view builds from the premise that technological innovation is difficult for outside investors to
evaluate (e.g., Holmstrom, 1989, Allen and Gale, 1999), so that improving incentives for
acquiring information enhances valuations, lowers the cost of capital, and improves
investment in innovative activities (Merton, 1987, Diamond and Verrecchia, 2012). One way
that restricting insider trading can increase incentives for acquiring information is by
reducing the ability of corporate insiders to exploit other investors, which encourages those
investors to devote more resources to valuing firms and improves the informativeness of
stock prices, as modeled by Fishman and Hagerty (1992) and DeMarzo et al. (1998) and
shown empirically by Bushman et al. (2005) and Fernandes and Ferreira (2009). Another way
that restricting insider trading can improve valuations is by boosting market liquidity

2
(Bhattacharya and Doauk, 2002). Greater liquidity can make it less costly for investors who
have acquired information to profit by trading in public markets (Kyle, 1984), which
encourages investors to devote more resources toward collecting information (Holmstrom
and Tirole, 1993). Furthermore, market liquidity can facilitate arbitrage trading activities and
correct the pricing of mis-valued stocks (Chordia, Roll, and Subrahmanyam, 2008). Thus,
restricting insider trading can improve the valuation of and enhance investment in innovation.
Other theories, however, suggest that restricting insider trading can deter effective
price discovery, with adverse effects on innovation. For example, Leland (1992) stresses that
insider trading quickly reveals that information in public markets, improving the
informativeness of prices and the allocation of resources. And, Grossman and Stiglitz (1980)
argue that when liquid markets immediately reveal information to the public, this reduces the
incentives for investors to expend private resources acquiring information on firms. From
these perspectives, restricting insider trading could slow innovation by increasing
informational asymmetries about novel endeavors.
By influencing price discovery and market liquidity, insider trading can also affect
managerial incentives. To the extent that restricting insider trading enhances the efficiency of
stock prices, this can reduce the disincentives of investing in opaque and risky, albeit valuemaximizing, innovative endeavors, as suggested by the work of Manso (2011), Ederer and
Manso (2013), and Ferreira et al. (2014). In contrast, highly liquid markets can both (a)
attract myopic investors who chase short-run profits (e.g., Bushee, 1998, 2001), which can
incentivize managers to forgo profit-maximizing long-run investments in order to satisfy
short-term performance targets (Stein, 1988, 1989) and (b) facilitate takeovers (Kyle and
Vila, 1991), which can encourage managers to choose investments that boost short-run profits
instead of longer gestation investments in innovation (Shleifer and Summers, 1988). Thus,
theory suggests that restricting insider trading can either enhance or harm managerial
incentives, with correspondingly conflicting predictions about the impact of insider trading
on innovation.
To provide the first assessment of whether legal systems that protect outside investors
from corporate insiders increase or decrease the rate of innovation, we exploit the quasi-

3
natural experiment of the staggered enforcement of insider trading laws across countries.
Specifically, we use the date when a country first prosecutes a violator of its insider trading
laws, which is provided by Bhattacharya and Daouk (2002) for 103 countries starting with
the U.S. in 1961. This setting is appealing for three reasons. First, countries started enforcing
their insider trading laws for a variety of reasons, such as increased competition between
stock exchanges for trading volume, and differences in political ideologies (Beny, 2013).
Fortunately, there is no indication that technological innovation or the desire to influence
innovation affected the timing of when countries started enforcing their insider trading laws.
Thus, the potential effects of enforcement on innovation are likely unintended consequences
of these legal actions. Second, the cross-country heterogeneity in the timing of the
enforcement of insider trading laws allows us to employ a difference-in-differences strategy
to identify their impact on innovation. As discussed below, we conduct and report several
tests that support the validity of this strategy. Third, this setting allows us to test whether the
cross-industry response of innovation and equity issuances to restrictions on insider trading
are consistent with particular theoretical perspectives of how insider trading affects
innovation. For example, models stressing that insider trading discourages outside investors
from researching firms predict that restricting insider trading will have a particularly positive
impact on investment in informationally opaque activities, including innovation. By
conducting these evaluations, we contribute to theoretical and policy debates about how legal
systems that protect small investors influence on the rate of technological innovation.
We use patent-based measures of innovation. Specifically, we obtain information on
patenting activities for industries (two-digit SIC level) in 94 countries from 1976 through
2006 from the EPO Worldwide Patent Statistical Database (PATSTAT) and compile a
sample of 76,321 country-industry-year observations. We construct and examine five patentbased proxies for technological innovation, but focus on two—the number of patents and the
number of patent citations—since they gauge the intensity and impact of innovative activity.
We also study (a) the number of patenting entities to assess the scope of innovative activities
(Acharya and Subramanian, 2009), (b) the degree to which technology classes other than the

4
one of the patent cite the patent, and (c) the degree to which the patent cites innovations in
other technology classes (Hall et al., 2001).
We begin with a simple difference-in-differences specification. Specifically, the
patent-based proxies of innovation, which are measured at the country-industry-year level,
are regressed on the enforcement indicator, which equals one after a country first enforces its
insider trading laws and zero otherwise. The regression also includes country, industry, and
year fixed effects and an assortment of time-varying country and industry characteristics.
Since we are concerned that the size of the economy and the level of economic development
might shape both innovation and policies toward insider trading, we control for Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) and GDP per capita. Since stock market and credit conditions could
influence innovation and the restrictions on insider trading, we also include stock market
capitalization as a share of GDP and credit as a share of GDP. Finally, factors shaping the
evolution of an industry’s export could also confound the analyses, so we control for industry
exports to the U.S. As mentioned above and described further below, we also examine
theoretical predictions concerning the differential impact of insider trading across industries.
Since we use U.S. data to categorize industries, we omit the U.S., though the results are
robust to including it.
We find that (1) the enforcement of insider trading laws is associated with a material
and statistically significant increase in each of the five proxies of innovation and (2) several
tests support the validity of our econometric strategy. For example, the number of patents
rises, on average, 26% after a country first enforces its insider trading laws and the impact of
innovation, as measured by citation counts, increases by 37%. In assessing the validity of this
approach, we first test and confirm that neither the level nor the growth rate in the patentbased measures predict the timing of the enforcement of insider trading laws. Second, we find
no significant pre-trends in the patent-based measures of innovation before a country’s first
enforcement action. Rather, there is a notable upward break in the time-series of the
innovation measures after a country starts enforcing its insider trading laws. Third, we
employ a discontinuity approach and assess whether other factors, such as trade, credit, real
output, etc. change in the same way after a country starts restricting insider trading as the

5
patent-based indicators change. We find that they do not, advertising the link between insider
trading and innovation per se. Fourth, we were concerned that other factors could be
changing at the same time as the enforcement of insider trading, confounding our
identification strategy. Consequently, we use a control function approach and include an
array of policy changes associated with international capital flows, securities markets, and
banks. Controlling for these policy reforms does not alter the results and has little effect on
the estimated coefficients.
We next augment our approach to test whether the cross-industry response of
innovation to restrictions on insider trading are consistent with particular theoretical
perspectives of how insider trading shapes innovation. That is, we include an interaction term
between the enforcement indicator and industry characteristics to examine the heterogeneous
response of industry innovation to the enforcement of insider trading laws. In these industrylevel analyses, we control for country-year and industry-year fixed effects to condition out all
time-varying country factors that might be changing at the same time as each country first
enforces its insider trading laws and time-varying industry characteristics that might
confound our ability to draw sharp inferences about the relationship between insider trading
and innovation. By focusing on changes in the cross-industry patterns of innovation, these
analyses enhance the identification strategy and provide cleaner insights into the relationship
between insider trading and innovation.
We differentiate industries along two theoretically-motivated dimensions. First, we
distinguish industries by their “natural rate” of innovation. If insider trading curtails
innovation by dissuading potential investors from expending resources valuing innovative
activities, then enforcement of insider trading laws should have a particularly pronounced
effect on innovation in naturally innovative industries—industries that would have
experienced rapid innovation if insider trading had not impeded accurate valuations. Given
that the U.S. is a highly innovative economy with well-developed securities markets that was
also the first country to prosecute a violator of its insider trading laws, we use it as a
benchmark to compute the natural rate of innovation for each industry. Using several
measures of the natural rate of innovation based on U.S. industries, we evaluate whether

6
innovative industries experience a bigger jump in innovation after a country starts enforcing
its insider trading laws.
Second, we differentiate industries by opacity. If insider trading discourages
innovation by impeding market valuations, then the enforcement of insider trading laws is
likely to exert an especially large positive impact on innovation in industries with a high
degree of informational asymmetries between insiders and potential outside investors. Put
differently, there is less of role for greater enforcement of insider trading limits to influence
innovation through the valuation channel if the pre-reform information gap is small. We use
several proxies of opacity across industries, again using the U.S. as the benchmark economy
to define each industry’s “natural” opacity. We then test whether naturally opaque industries
experience a larger increase in innovation rates after a country first prosecutes somebody for
violating its insider trading laws.
We find that the patent-based measures of innovation rise much more in naturally
innovative and naturally opaque industries after a country starts enforcing its insider trading
laws. For example, after a country’s first prosecution of insider trading, the number of patents
jumps 50% more in its industries that have above the median level of patenting activity in the
U.S. than it rises in its industries with below the median values. The same is true when
splitting the sample by the natural opacity of industries. For example, in industries with above
the median levels of intangible assets in the U.S., the patent-based measures of innovation
increase 30% more than they rise in industries with naturally lower levels of intangible assets.
Thus, enforcement is associated with a material increase in patent-based measures of
innovation and the cross-industry pattern of this increase is consistent with theories in which
restricting insider trading improves the informational content of stock prices.
We further extend these analyses by examining equity issuances. One mechanism
through which enhanced valuations can spur innovation is by lowering the cost of capital for
investment in innovation. Consistent with this view, we find that both initial public offering
(IPO) and seasonal equity offering (SEO) rise much more in naturally innovative industries
than they do in other industries after a country first enforces its insider trading laws. In
particular, the value of equity issuances increases 40% to 63% more in naturally innovative

7
industries than it rises in other industries after a country starts enforcing its insider trading
laws. These findings further support the view that legal systems that protect outside investors
from corporate insiders facilitate investment in innovative activities.
We also address several potential additional concerns. First, the results might be
driven only by the extensive margin, in which an industry in a country first applies for a
patent, or the intensive margin, in which already innovating industries intensify their
patenting activities. We find that innovation increases at both the extensive and intensive
margins after countries start enforcing their insider trading laws. Second, we were concerned
that the results might only obtain in some countries, so we split the sample by the level of
economic development, the level financial development, and whether the country has a
market-oriented political ideology. The results hold in each of these subsamples with very
similar coefficient estimates.
Our findings relate to several lines of research. A considerable body of work finds
that laws and regulations that protect small investors by enhancing the transparency, integrity,
and contestability of markets enhance the quality of financial markets and institutions (e.g.,
La Porta et al., 2006, Barth et al., 2006). Consistent with these findings, we find that
restricting insider trading is associated with a material increase in innovative activity and a
sharp rise in equity issuances among firms in innovative industries. Similarly, our work
contributes to the debate on the regulation and social consequences of insider trading
(Fishman and Hagerty, 1992, Leland, 1992, Khanna et al., 1994, DeMarzo et al, 1998,
Acharya and Johnson, 2007, 2010). Although we do not examine each theoretical channel
through which insider trading might affect innovation, we do show that enforcing insider
trading laws boosts innovation and equity issuances in a manner that is consist with models
emphasizing that insider trading reduces the precision with which markets value innovative
activities and raises the cost of capital for such investments.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the data, while section 3 presents
the empirical strategies and validity tests. Section 4 provides the main results and robustness
checks, and section 5 examines insider trading and equity issuances. Section 6 concludes.

2. Data
In this section, we describe the data on the enforcement of insider trading laws and
patents. We define the other data used in the analyses when we present the regression results.

2.1. Enforcement of insider trading laws
Bhattacharya and Daouk (2002) compile data on the enforcement of insider trading
laws for 103 economies. They obtain these data by contacting stock exchanges and asking (a)
whether they had insider trading laws and, if yes, in what year were they first enacted and (b)
whether there had been prosecutions, successful or unsuccessful, under these laws and, if yes,
in what year was the first prosecution. We use the year in which a country first prosecutes a
violator of its insider trading laws, rather than the date on which a country first enacts laws
restricting insider trading, because Bhattacharya et al. (2000) note that the existence of
insider trading laws without the enforcement of them does not deter insider trading.
Furthermore, following Bhattacharya and Daouk (2002), and others, we use the first time that
a country’s authorities enforce insider trading laws because the initial enforcement (a)
represents a shift of legal regime from a non-prosecution to a prosecution regime and (b)
signals a discrete jump in the probability of future prosecutions. Based on the information
provided in Appendix A, 82 out of the 94 countries with complete data had insider trading
laws on their books by 2002, but only 36 of those 82 economies had enforced those laws at
any point before 2002. As a point of reference, the U.S. first enacted laws prohibiting insider
trading in 1934 and first enforced those laws in 1961.
Enforce equals one in the years after a country first prosecutes somebody for violating
its insider trading laws, and otherwise equals zero. For those years in which a country does
not have insider trading laws, Enforce equals zero. Enforce equals zero in the year of the first
enforcement, but the results are robust to setting it to one instead.

9
2.2. Patents
The EPO Worldwide Patent Statistical Database (PATSTAT) provides data on more
than 80 million patent applications filed in over 100 patent offices around the world. It
contains basic bibliographic information on patents, including the identity number of the
application and granted patent, the date of the patent application, the date when the patent is
granted, the track record of patent citations, information on the patent assignees (i.e., the
owner of the patent), and the technological “section”, “class”, and “subclass” to which each
patent belongs (i.e., the International Patent Classification (IPC)). 1, 2
Critically, PATSTAT provides an identifier of each distinct “patent family”, which
includes all of the patents linked to a particular invention since some inventions are patented
in multiple patent offices. With this patent family identifier, we identify the first time an
invention is patented and we call this the “original patent.” PATSTAT is updated biannually
and we use the 2015 spring release, which has data through the end of the fifth week of 2015.
We restrict the PATSTAT sample as follows. We only include patents filed with and
eventually granted by the European Patent Office (EPO) or by one of the patent offices in the
34 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) to ensure comparability across jurisdictions of intellectual property rights. We
further restrict the sample to non-U.S. countries because we use the U.S. as the benchmark
economy when characterizing industry traits for all countries (Rajan and Zingales, 1998). To

1

For example, consider a typical IPC “A61K 36/815”. The first character identifies the IPC “section”, which in
this example is “A”. There are eight sections in total (from A to H). The next two characters (“61” in this
example) give the IPC “class”; the next character, “K”, provides the “subclass”; the next two characters (“36”)
give the “main group”, while the last three characters (“815”) give the sub-group. Not all patent authorities
provide IPCs at the main-group and sub-group levels, so we use the section, class, and subclass when referring
to an IPC. With respect to these technological classifications, there are about 600 IPC subclasses.
2

IPCs assigned to a patent can be inventive or non-inventive. All patents have at least one inventive IPC. We
only use inventive IPCs for classifying a patent’s technological section, class, and subclass. Furthermore, if the
patent authority designates an inventive IPC as secondary (“L” in the ipc_position of the PATSTAT), we
remove that IPC from further consideration. This leaves only inventive IPCs that the patent authority designates
as primary (“F” in the ipc_position of the PATSTAT) or that the patent authority does not designate as either
primary or secondary, i.e., undesignated IPCs. In no case does a patent authority designate a patent as having
two primary IPCs. In our dataset, 19% of patents have multiple inventive IPCs (in which the patent authority
designates the IPC as either primary or does not give it a designation); where 6% have both a primary inventive
IPC and at least one undesignated IPC; and 13% have no primary IPC and multiple undesignated IPCs. In cases
with multiple inventive IPCs, we do the following. First, we assign equal weight to each IPC subclass. That is, if
a patent has two IPC subclasses, we count it as 0.5 in each subclass. From a patent’s IPC subclasses, we choose
a unique IPC section. We simply choose the first one based on the alphabetical ordering of the IPC sections.

10
further mitigate potential problems with using U.S. industries as benchmarks, we only
include a country in the sample if at least one entity in the country has applied for and
received a patent for its invention from the United States Patent and Trademark Office
(USPTO) within our sample period because industries in these economies are presumably
more comparable with those in the U.S. This restriction excludes Zambia, Namibia,
Botswana, and Mongolia. The results, however, are robust to including these countries or the
U.S. in the regression analyses. Finally, since we use data from the United Nations
Commodity Trade (UN Comtrade) Statistics Database in our regression analyses, we exclude
economies that UN Comtrade does not cover (Taiwan and Yugoslavia). Throughout the
analyses, we follow the patent literature and focus on utility patents. 3 After employing these
restrictions and merging the patent data with the data on the enforcement of insider trading
laws, we have a sample of 94 economies between 1976 and 2006.
Following the patent literature, we date patents using the application year of original
patents that are eventually granted. The literature uses the application year, rather than the
actual year in which the patent is granted, because the application year is closer to the date of
the innovation (Griliches et al., 1987) and because the application year avoids varying delays
between the application and grant year (Hall et al., 2001, Acharya and Subramanian, 2009,
Acharya et al., 2013). Moreover, we use the original patent—the first patent on an
invention—when defining the date, the technological section and subclass(es), the country of
the invention, etc. That is, if the same underlying invention has multiple patents, i.e., the
patents are part of a patent family, we choose the patent with the earliest grant date and call
this the original patent. We then use the application year of this original patent to (a) date the
invention, (b) define the technological section and subclass(es) of the invention (i.e., its
IPC(s)), and (c) record the country of residence of its primary assignee (i.e., owner) and the
country of the invention.
When computing measures of innovation based on citations, we avoid double
counting of different patents within a patent family, by examining citations at the patent
3

In addition to utility patents, the PATSTAT also includes two other minor patent categories: utility models and
design patents. As with the NBER database and consistent with U.S. patent law, we only include utility patents.

11
family level. Thus, if another patent cites multiple patents in different patenting offices on the
single invention underlying a patent family “A,” we count this as one citation. In this way, we
focus on citations by inventions to inventions regardless of where and in how many offices
the inventions are patented.
Since we conduct our analyses at the industry-country-year-level and merge different
data sources, we must reconcile the different industrial classifications used by the PATSTAT
and the other data sources and implement criterion for including or excluding industrycountry-year observations in which we find no evidence of patenting activity. With respect to
industry categories, we convert the PATSTAT IPCs into two-digit Standard Industrial
Classifications (SICs). 4 With respect to sampling criteria, our core sample excludes an
industry-country-year observation in which no entity in that country’s industry files for a
patent in that year. Thus, our core analyses focus exclusively on the intensive margin: Is there
a change in patenting activity in industries already engaged in innovation? In robustness tests
reported below, however, we also consider the extensive margin. We include those industrycountry-year observations in which we find no patenting activity and code those observations
as zero. All of the results hold when examining this large sample.
We construct five measures of innovative activities for each industry-country-year.
Patent Count in industry i, in country c, in year t equals the natural logarithm of one
plus the total number of eventually-granted patent applications belonging to industry i that
are filed with the patent offices in one of the 34 OECD countries and/or the EPO in year t by
applicants from country c. As emphasized above, we do everything at the invention—patent
family—level and then convert the PATSTAT IPCs to two-digit SICs.
Patent Entities equals the natural logarithm of one plus the total number of distinct
entities in country c, that apply for patents in industry i in year t. Similar to Patent Count,
Patent Entities is also constructed at the IPC subclass level and then converted to the two4

We first follow the mapping scheme provided by Lybbert and Zolas (2012) for converting IPCs into
International Standard Industrial Classifications (ISICs). The World Intellectual Property Office (WIPO)
provides the Lybbert and Zolas (2012) mapping scheme at:
http://www.wipo.int/econ_stat/en/economics/publications.html. We then convert the ISIC to SICs using the
concordance scheme from the United Nations Statistical Division, which is detailed at:
http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regdnld.asp?Lg=1.

12
digit SIC level. Following Acharya and Subramanian (2009), we include Patent Entities since
it accounts for the scope of participation in innovative activities. While Patent Count and
Patent Entities measure the intensity and scope of innovative activities, respectively, they do
not measure the comparative impact of different patents on future innovation (Acharya and
Subramanian, 2009, Hsu et al., 2014). Thus, we also use measures based on citations.
Citation equals the natural logarithm of one plus the total number of citations to
patent families in industry i, in country c, and in year t, where t is the application year. Thus,
if a patent cites two patents on the same invention filed in different patent offices, we only
count this as one citation. Similarly, if two patents in the same patent family each cites an
invention, we only count this as one citation. As emphasized above, we seek to measure
citations by inventions of other inventions and not double count such citations because of an
invention being patented in multiple offices. As an invention—a patent family—may
continue to receive citations for years beyond 2014, the last full year covered by the
PATSTAT, we adjust for truncation bias using the method developed by Hall et al. (2001,
2005). 5 Then, we sum the citation counts over all patent families within each IPC subclass
and convert this to the two-digit SIC level for each industry i, in country c, and in year t.

More specifically, for patents granted in and before 1985 (when at least 30-years of actual citations can be
observed by the end of 2014), we use the actual citations recorded in the PATSTAT. For patents granted after
1985, we implement the following four-step process to adjust for truncation bias.
(1) Based on each cohort of granted patents for which we have 30 years of actual citation data (e.g., patents
granted in 1985 or earlier), we compute for each IPC section (K), the share of citations in each year (L) since the
patents were granted, where the share is relative to the total number of citations received over the 30 years since
the patents were granted. We refer to this share, for each IPC section in each year, as 𝑃𝐿𝐾 , where 𝐿 =
𝐾
0,1, … , 29, and ∑29
𝐿=0 𝑃𝐿 = 1 for each K. The year of the grant corresponds to year zero.
(2) We calculate the cumulative share of citations for section K from year zero to year L. We refer to this

as 𝑆𝐿𝐾 , where 𝑆𝐿𝐾 = ∑𝐿𝜏=0 𝑃𝜏𝐾 , 𝐿 = 0,1, … , 29, and 𝑆𝐿=29
(3) After completing steps (1) and (2) for all patents granted before 1985, where 1985 is the last cohort in which
we have 30 years of actual citation data, we compute the average cumulative share for each 𝑆𝐿𝐾 over the ten
cohorts (1976-1985) to obtain a series of estimates 𝑆𝐿̅ 𝐾 . We use the average cumulative share 𝑆𝐿̅ 𝐾 as the
estimated share of citations that a patent receives if it belongs to section K and was granted L years before 2014.
Thus, 𝑆𝐿̅ 𝐾 equals 1 for patents granted in and before 1985.

Generality is a measure of the degree to which patents by each particular industry in a
country are cited by patents in other types of technologies. Thus, a high generality score
suggests that the invention is applicable to a wide array of inventive activities. We construct
Generality as follows. We first compute a patent’s generality value as one minus the
Herfindahl Index of the IPC sections of patents citing it. This provides information on the
degree to which a patent is cited by different technologies, i.e., sections other than the IPC
section of the patent itself. We then sum the generality scores of all patents within each IPC
subclass, in each country, and each year. Finally, we convert the resultant values to SIC
industries using the method describe above and take the natural logarithm of one plus the
original value to obtain an overall Generality measurement at the industry-country-year level.
Originality is a measure of the degree to which patents by each particular industry in a
country cite patents in other technologies. Larger values of Originality indicate that patents in
that industry build on innovations from a wider array of technologies, i.e., the patents in that
industry do not simply build on a single line of inventions. We construct Originality as
follows. We first compute a patent’s originality value as one minus the Herfindahl Index of
the IPC sections of patents that it cites. We then sum the originality values of all patents
within each IPC subclass, in each country, in each year. Finally, we map this IPC-based
indicator to SIC industries and take the natural logarithm of one plus the original value to
obtain an overall Originality measurement at the industry-country-year level. 6
We also construct and use two variants of these measures. Specifically, Patent
Count*, Patent Entities*, Citation*, Generality* and Originality* equal the values of Patent
Count, Patent Entities, Citation, Generality and Originality respectively before the log
transformation. Furthermore, we also create country-year aggregates of the patent-based
measures of innovation, in addition to the country-industry-year versions discussed above.

citations over the period 2006-2014 by the weighting factor of 1/𝑆𝐿=8
the patent in section K and cohort 2006.

Generality and Originality are based on Hall et al. (2001), but we use the eight IPC sections, while they selfdesign six technological categories based on the US Patent Classification System. Thus, we use the IPC section
to calculate the Herfindahl indexes of the generality and originality values of each patent. We then sum these
values for patents within each IPC subclass. There are about 600 subclasses within the PATSTAT, which
correspond closely in terms of granularity to the 400 categories (i.e., the three-digit classification) under the U.S.
patent classification system.

14
For example, Patent Count c equals the natural logarithm of one plus the total number of
eventually-granted patent applications in year t by applicants from country c. Patent Entitiesc,
Citationc, Generalityc, and Originalityc are defined analogously.
Table 1 and Table 2 provide detailed variable definitions and summary statistics,
respectively, on all of the variables used in the paper, while Appendix A provides more
detailed information on the five patent-based indicators. In Appendix A, the patent-based
measures are averaged over the sample period. Patent Count* ranges from an average of 0.05
patents per industry-year in Bangladesh to 468 per industry-year in Japan. The average
number of truncation-adjusted citations for patents in an industry-year ranges from 0.06 in
Swaziland to 9,620 in Japan. Table 2 further emphasizes the large dispersion in innovation
across countries by pooling overall industry-country-years. On average, a country-industry
has 36 eventually-granted patents per year, while the standard deviation is as high as 204.
Citation* is also highly dispersed. In an average industry-country-year, the average value of
Citation* is 442 with a standard deviation of 3,526.

3. Empirical strategies

3.1 Baseline strategy
We begin with a standard difference-in-differences specification to assess whether
patent-based indicators of innovation rise after a country first prosecutes a violator of its
insider trading laws.
′
𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 = 𝛼0 + 𝛼1 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛾𝑋𝑖,𝑐,𝑡
+ 𝛿𝑐 + 𝛿𝑖 + 𝛿𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 .

(1)

𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 is one of the five patent-based measures of innovation in industry i, of

country c, in year t: Patent Count, Patent Entities, Citation, Generality, and Originality. The
regressor of interest is 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑐,𝑡 , which equals one in the years after a country first enforces

its insider trading laws, and zero otherwise. The regression includes country (𝛿𝑐 ), industry
(𝛿𝑗 ), and time (𝛿𝑡 ) fixed effects to control for unobservable time-invariant country and

15
industry characteristics, as well as all contemporaneous correlations across observations in
the same year. We use two-way clustering of the errors, at both the country and year level.
The regression also includes time-varying country and industry characteristics (X).
We include the natural logarithm of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the natural
logarithm of GDP per capita (GDP per capita) because the size of the economy and the level
of economic development might influence both legal approaches to insider trading and the
degree to which entities file patents with patent offices in more developed OECD countries
(Acharya and Subramanian 2009, Acharya et al., 2013). We also control for stock market
capitalization (Stock/GDP) and domestic credit provided by the financial sector (Credit/GDP)
since the overall functioning of the financial system can influence both innovation and the
enforcement of insider trading laws. These country level control variables are obtained from
the World Development Indicators (WDI) database and the Financial Development and
Structure (FDS) database (Beck et al., 2009) via the World Bank. At the industry-countrytime level, we control for the ratio of each industry's exports to the U.S. over its country's
total exports to the U.S. in each year (Export to US), since economic linkages with the U.S.
might shape an industry’s investment in innovation. The sample varies across specifications
due to the availability of these control variables.
The coefficient, 𝛼1 , on Enforce provides an estimate of what happens to the patent-

based indicators after the country first enforces its insider trading laws, conditioning on the
various fixed effects and other control variables specified in equation (1). As shown below,
the results are robust to including or excluding the time-varying country and industry
characteristics (X).
There are several challenges, however, that we must address to use the coefficient
estimate, 𝛼1 , to draw inferences about the impact of insider trading laws on the patent-based

indicators of innovation. First, reverse causality could confound our analyses, i.e., the rate of
innovation, or changes in the rate of innovation, might influence when countries enact and
enforce their insider trading laws. Second, the patent-based indicators might be trending, so
finding patenting activity is different after enforcement might reflect these trends, rather than
a change associated with the enforcement of insider trading laws. Third, omitted variables

16
might limit our ability to identify the impact of change in the legal system’s protection of
potential outside investors from corporate insiders on innovation. For example, factors
omitted from equation (1) might change at the same time as the country starts enforcing
insider trading and it might be these omitted factors that shape subsequent innovation, not the
enforcement of insider trading laws. Without controlling for such factors, we cannot
confidently infer the impact of the enforcement on innovation from 𝛼1 .

We address each of these concerns below. First, we find no evidence that either the

level or the rate of change in the patent-based measures predict the timing of when countries
start enforcing their insider trading laws. Second, we find no pre-trends in the patent-based
indicators before a country’s first enforcement action; rather there is a notable break in
innovation after a country starts enforcing its insider trading laws. Third, we provide different
assessment of the degree to which omitted variables affect the analyses: (1) we use a
discontinuity design and test whether other factors, such as international trade and financial
development, change in the same way that the patent-based indicators change after the
enforcement of insider trading laws; (2) we include an array of other policy changes
associated with international capital flows, trade, securities markets, and banks to assess the
robustness of the estimated value of 𝛼1 ; and (3) we augment the baseline strategy and assess

the differential response of industries to the enforcement of insider trading laws, so that we
can include country-year fixed effects to absorb any confounding events arising at the
country-year level. As documented below, the evidence from these tests supports the validity
of our econometric strategy.

3.2. Industry-based empirical strategy
We next assess whether the cross-industry response to enforcing insider trading laws
is consistent with particular theoretical perspectives on how protecting outside investors from
corporate insiders will affect innovation. To do this, we augment the baseline specification
with an interaction term between Enforce and theoretically-motivated industry traits,
Industry, and with more granular fixed effects:
′
𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑐,𝑡 × 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖 + 𝜆𝑋𝑖,𝑐,𝑡
+ 𝛿𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛿𝑖,𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 . (2)

17
𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖 measures industry traits, which we define below, that are the same across all
countries and years. With the industry-based empirical strategy, equation (2) now controls for

country-time and industry-time fixed effects. The country-time effect controls for all timevarying and time invariant country characteristics, while the industry-year effect absorbs all
time-varying and time invariant industry traits. We do not include Enforce, Industry, and all
of the control variables included in equation (1), except Export to US, separately in equation
(2) because they are subsumed in the fixed effects. The coefficient on the interaction term
(𝛽1) provides an estimate of the differential change in innovation across industries traits after
a country first enforces its insider trading laws.

The first category of industry traits measures the “natural rate” of innovation in each
industry. More specifically, if the enforcement of insider trading laws promotes innovation by
removing an impediment to the market accurately evaluating innovations, then enforcement
should have a particularly pronounced effect on innovation in those industries that had been
most severely hampered by the impediment: “naturally innovative” industries. To measure
which industries are naturally innovative, i.e., industries that innovate more rapidly than other
industries when national authorities enforce insider trading laws, we follow Rajan and
Zingales (1998) and use the U.S. as the benchmark country for defining the natural rate of
innovation in each industry and construct and use two metrics based on the U.S. data.
The first measure of the natural rate of innovation is High Tech, which is a dummy
variable that designates whether an industry is technology intensive or not. Based on the
work of Hsu et al. (2014), we first calculate high-tech intensiveness as the annual percentage
growth rate in R&D expenses for each publicly listed U.S. firm in each year. We then use the
cross-firm average within each two-digit SIC industry as the measurement of high-tech
intensiveness in a particular industry-year. We next take the time-series average over our
sample period (1976-2006) to obtain a high-tech intensiveness measure for each industry.
Finally, High Tech is assigned the value of one if the corresponding industry measurement is
above the sample median and zero otherwise. Throughout the analyses, we use similar zeroone industry categorizations for values below or above the sample median. However, all of

18
the results reported below hold when using continuous measures of the industry traits instead
of these zero-one measures.
The second measure of whether an industry is naturally innovative is Innovation
Propensity. To construct this variable, we follow Acharya and Subramanian (2009) and focus
on (eventually-granted) patents that are filed with the USPTO during our sample period.
First, for each U.S. firm in each year, we determine the number of patents that it applies for in
each U.S. technological class defined in the Current U.S. Class (CCL) system. Second, for
each U.S. technological class in each year, we compute the average number of patents filed
by a U.S. firm. Third, we take the time-series average over the sample period within each
technological class. Fourth, we map this to SIC industries using the mapping table compiled
by Hsu et al. (2014) and obtain each industry’s U.S. innovation propensity at the two-digit
SIC level. The indicator variable Innovation Propensity is set to one if the industry measure is
above the sample median and zero otherwise.
The second category of industry traits measures the natural opacity of each industry,
i.e., the difficulty of the market formulating an accurate valuation of firms in the industry. If
the enforcement of insider trading laws boosts innovation by encouraging markets to
overcome informational asymmetries, then we should observe a larger increase in innovation
in those industries that had been most hampered by informational asymmetries. To measure
which industries are naturally opaque, we again use the U.S. as the benchmark country in
constructing measures of opacity.
The first measure of whether an industry is naturally opaque is Intangibility, which
measures the degree to which the industry has a comparatively large proportion of intangible
assets. We use this measure under the assumption that intangible assets are more difficult for
outsider investors to value than tangible assets, which is consistent with the empirical
findings in Chan et al. (2001). To calculate Intangibility, we start with the accounting value
of the ratio of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) to total assets for each firm in each year,
where PPE is a common measure of asset tangibility (e.g., Baker and Wurgler, 2002; Molina,
2005). We then calculate the average of the PPE to total assets ratio across firms in the same
industry-year and take the average over the sample period (1976-2006) for each industry. We

19
next compute one minus the PPE-to-total-assets ratio for each industry. Throughout the
construction, we use U.S. firms to form this industry benchmark. Finally, we set Intangibility
equal to one for industries in which one minus the PPE-to-total assets ratio is greater than the
median across industries and zero otherwise.
As a second measure of the degree to which an industry is naturally opaque, we use
the standardized dispersion of the market-to-book value of firms in U.S. industries, where the
standardization is done relative to the average market-to-book equity ratio of publicly listed
U.S. firms in each industry. Intuitively, wider dispersion of the market-to-book values
indicates a greater degree of heterogeneity in how the market values firms in the same
industry. This greater heterogeneity, in turn, can signal more firm opaqueness as the other
firms in the same industry do not serve as good benchmarks. Following Harford (2005), we
calculate the within-industry standard deviation of the market-to-book ratio across all U.S.
publicly listed firms in each industry-year and take the average over time to measure marketto-book dispersion in each U.S. industry. We then standardize the market-to-book dispersion
by dividing it by the average market-to-book value of each industry. Accordingly, STD of
MTB equals one for observations above the cross-industry median and zero otherwise.
There might be concerns that the first category of industry traits that focuses on
naturally innovative industries is empirically and conceptually related to the second category
that focuses on opacity because of the comparatively high costs of valuing innovative
endeavors. However, in only 23% of industries are High Tech and Intangibility both equal to
one. 7 They are also conceptually distinct. For example, two industries might be equally
opaque, but one might be more naturally innovative. In this case, the enforcement of insider
trading laws would enhance the valuation of both industries but it would spur a larger jump in
innovation in the more innovative industry. Similarly, two industries might have equal
degrees of natural innovativeness, but one might be more opaque. In this case, enforcement
would have a bigger impact on valuations in the more opaque industry and therefore have a

7

Only 35% of industries categorized as either innovative or opaque, are labeled as both innovative and opaque.

20
bigger impact innovation in the naturally more opaque industry. Thus, we examine both
categories of industry traits, while recognizing that there is overlap.

3.3 Preliminary evidence regarding the validity of these strategies
In this subsection, we present four types of analyses that advertise the validity and
value of our empirical strategy. To assess the assumption that the initial enforcement of
insider trading laws is not driven by pre-existing innovative activities, we start by plotting the
year that a country first enforces its insider trading against (1) the patent-based measures of
innovation in the years before a country first enforced its insider trading laws and (2) the rate
of change of these patent-based measures of innovation before enforcement. Thus, Figure 1
provides two plots for each of the patent-based measures of innovation. We exclude countries
in which authorities started enforcing their insider trading laws before the start of the sample
period. As portrayed in Figure 1, neither the levels nor the rates of change in the innovation
proxies predict the timing of the initial enforcement of insider trading laws. While by no
means definitive, this mitigates some concerns about reverse causality.
Second, we employ a hazard model to study the factors shaping when countries first
enforce their insider trading laws. In particular, we test whether patent-based measures of
innovation predict when a country first brings a prosecution against insider trading in a given
year conditional on the fact that no such prosecution had ever been initiated. We assume the
hazard rate follows a Weibull distribution and use the natural log of survival time (i.e.,
expected time to the initial enforcement) as the dependent variable, where longer time
indicates lower likelihood of being enforced. As the key explanatory variables, we use
country-year measures of innovation. Specifically, Patent Count c is the natural logarithm of
one plus the total number of eventually-granted patent applications filed in year t by
applicants from country c. Patent Entities c is the natural logarithm of one plus the total
number of distinct entities in country c that apply for patents in year t. Citation c, Generality c,
and Originality c are defined similarly.

21
As shown in Table 3, pre-existing patent-based measures of innovation do not predict
the timing of the first enforcement action. 8 We control for economic and financial
development (GDP, GDP per capita, Stock/GDP, and Credit/GDP) and important
characteristics related to a country’s legal institution and political status. Specifically, we
include legal origin, i.e., whether the country has common law or civil law heritage, because
La Porta et al. (1998, 2008) and the subsequent literature emphasize how legal heritage can
influence an assortment of laws concerning financial contracting. We also include a score
measure of the extent of democracy in a country (Polity), which ranges from -10 (strongly
autocratic) to +10 (strongly democratic), legislature fractionalization (i.e., the probability that
two randomly-picked representatives in the legislature would come from two different
parties), and indicators of political orientation of the largest party in the government (Right,
Left and Central). 9 In all the five specifications, patent-based measures of innovation enter
the regression insignificantly. Thus, there is no evidence that a country’s rate of innovation
predicts when it will start enforcing its insider trading laws.
Third, we examine the dynamic relationship between innovation and the first time that
a country enforces its insider trading laws. Following Beck et al. (2010), we augment the
baseline regression in equation (1) with a series of time dummies relative to the year of initial
enforcement of the laws (t=0) and use the following:
𝜏=𝑡+15
′
Innovationc,t = 𝛼0 + 𝛼1,𝜏 ∑𝜏=𝑡−10
Enforce𝑐,𝜏 + 𝜆𝑋𝑐,𝑡
+ 𝛿𝑐 + 𝛿𝑡 + ε𝑐,𝑡 , where τ ≠ 0.

(3)

Innovationc,t is either Patent Count c Citation c, which are our two, core patent-based
indicators of innovation. Enforce𝑐,𝜏 is a dummy variable that equals one if the observation at
time t is τ years away from the year of initial law enforcement. If τ is greater than zero, then

the dummy identifies the τth year after the initial enforcement of the insider trading laws; if τ

Table 3 provides the results for the sample of countries in which the country did not enforce its insider
trading laws before the start of the sample period. This includes both countries that enforced their laws
during the sample period and those that did not enforce their insider trading laws during the sample period.
The same results hold when only including countries that enforced their laws during the sample period.

Central) are obtained from the Database of Political Institution (Beck et al., 2001).

22
is smaller than zero, it represents the τth year before the initial enforcement. We include a
total of 25 dummies to trace out the year-by-year effect on innovation from at most 10 years
before the event to at most 15 years afterwards. At the end points, all the years over 10 years
before the initial enforcement are captured by the dummy Enforce𝑐,−10 while all the years

beyond 15 years after the initial enforcement captured by the dummy 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑐,+15 . The
year of initial enforcement is dropped from the regression. To center the figure, we subtract

the average value of the estimated values of 𝛼1,𝜏 in the pre-enforcement period from each

coefficient estimate. We then plot the estimated coefficients (minus this pre-enforcement

mean). We also include the 95% confidence interval, which is adjusted for country level
clustering. Thus, the confidence intervals evaluate whether each estimated parameter is
significantly different from the pre-enforcement mean. In terms of control variables, Xc,t
includes GDP, GDP per capita, Stock/GDP, and Credit/GDP and the regressions also include
country and year fixed effects. Thus, if the enforcement of insider trading laws is simply
linked to innovation through its association with overall economic or financial development,
this will be captured by the control variables.
Figure 2 illustrates two crucial findings. First, there is a significant increase in the
patent-based measures of innovation after a country starts enforcing its insider trading laws.
Consistent with the view that enforcement encourages innovative activities, Figure 2 depicts
a 27% increase in Patent Counts c after five years (from the centered value on the first
enforcement date) and an even bigger increase in Citation c. The second key finding confirms
the results from the hazard model: There is not a trend in the patent-based measures of
innovation prior to the year in which a country first enforces its insider trading laws. The
overall pattern suggests that enforcing insider trading has an immediate and enduring
simulative effect on the quantity (Patent Counts c) and quality (Citation c) of patenting.
Fourth, we employ a discontinuity approach to assess whether there are similar
changes in other factors that might influence innovation when countries start enforcing their
insider trading laws, which may confound the interpretation of the results presented below.
For example, the work by Beny (2013) and others suggests that factors associated with
international trade and overall financial development have shaped and been shaped by insider

23
trading laws. Thus, we build on the dynamic specification in equation (3), and use
Credit/GDP or Trade/GDP as dependent variable. Credit/GDP measures the development of
domestic credit market; Trade/GDP gauges the intensity of international trade. As shown in
Figure 3, nether the credit markets or the international trade changes in the same way that the
patent-based indicators change after enforcement; indeed, neither Credit/GDP nor
Trade/GDP changes appreciably around the date when countries start enforcing their insider
trading laws. These findings reinforce the validity of our identification strategy.
4. Empirical Results
In this section, we present results on the relationship between technological
innovation and the enforcement of insider trading laws. We first use the baseline specification
to evaluate what happens to patent-based proxies of innovation after a country first enforces
its insider trading laws. We then present the results from the industry-level approach, in
which we access the heterogeneous response of industries to enforcement.

4.1 Baseline Specification
Table 4 presents the regression results from the baseline equation (1) defined in
Section 3. The table consists of five columns, one for each patent-based proxy, and two
panels, where Panel A presents results in which the regressors besides Enforce are the
country, industry, and year fixed effects and where, in Panel B, the regressions also include
the time-varying country and industry characteristics defined above. Thus, Table 4 presents
the results from ten model specifications. In all of the regressions reported throughout the
remainder of the paper, the standard errors are two-way clustered at both the country and year
level, allowing for statistical inferences that are robust to correlations among error terms
within both country and year clusters.
The results indicate that all of the patent-based measures increase materially after the
average country first enforces its insider trading laws. Enforce enters with a positive and
statistically significant coefficient in all ten regressions. The coefficient estimates also
indicate that there is an economically large increase in the innovation measures after

24
countries start enforcing their insider trading laws. For example, consider Panel B, which
includes the broadest set of control variables. The results indicate that the initial enforcement
of insider trading laws is associated with a 26% increase in Patent Counts (i.e., patenting
intensity), a 21% increase in the number of Patenting Entities (i.e., scope of patenting
activity), a 37% increase in Citations (i.e., impact), a 16% in Generality (i.e., breadth of
impact on other technologies), and an 18% increase in Originality (i.e., breadth of other
technologies cited).
To address concerns that countries adopt packages of policy reforms at the same that
they start enforcing insider trading laws, potentially confounding our identification strategy,
we include an assortment of policy indicators in Table 5. Specifically, into the Table 4
regressions we now include (1) Credit Control, which is an index of the restrictiveness of
reserve requirements, existence of mandatory credit allocation requirements, and credit
ceilings, with greater index for fewer restrictions, (2) Interest Rate Control, which measures
the inverse of the extent to which the authorities control interest rates, (3) Entry Barriers,
which measures the ease of foreign bank entry and the extent of competition in the domestic
banking sector (e.g., restrictions on branching), (4) Bank Supervision, which measures the
degree of supervision over the banking sector, (5) Bank Privatization, which measures the
presence of state owned banks, (6) Capital Control, which measures restrictions on
international capital flows, and again with greater value associated with fewer restrictions, (7)
Securities Market, which measures the level of development of securities markets and
restrictions on foreign equity ownership, (8) Financial Reform Index, which is the sum of the
previous seven variables, (9) Liberal Capital Markets, which is defined as one after a country
officially liberalized its capital market and zero otherwise (i.e. formal regulatory change after
which foreign investors officially have the opportunity to invest in domestic equity
securities), where the official liberalization date is obtained from Bekaert and Harvey (2000)
and augmented by Bekaert, Harvey and Lundblad (2005) for 68 countries in our sample.
Table 1 provides detailed definitions of these variables.
The results are robust to controlling for these indicators of policy reforms. Table 5
summarizes the results from 45 regressions, as we examine each of the nine policy reform

25
indicators individually for each of the five patent-based indicators of innovation. The
regressions continue to also control for country, industry, and year fixed effects along with
the time-varying country and industry controls. As shown, even when controlling for these
policy reforms, Enforce enters each of the regressions significantly. Indeed, when controlling
for these policy indicators, the estimated coefficient varies little from the estimates reported
in Table 4. These results help mitigate concerns that other policy changes that occur at the
same time as the enforcement of insider trading laws account for the close association
between enforcement and the uptick in innovation.
We provide three additional robustness tests in the Appendixes. First, we control for
country-industry fixed effects and year fixed effects in assessing the relationship between
innovation and enforcement. As shown in Appendix B, we find that Enforce enters positively
and significantly in each of the patent-based regressions and the estimated point estimates on
Enforce are very similar to those reported in Table 4. This robustness check ensures that the
results are not confounded by any time-invariant characteristics specific to each industry in
each country.
Second, we examine whether the results hold on both the extensive and intensive
margins. Specifically, as explained in the Section 2, our baseline sample excludes countryindustry observations in which we find no evidence of patenting activity. In this way, Table 4
focuses on the intensive margin. In Appendix C, we include those observations in which we
have no evidence of patenting and impose a value of zero for those country-industry
observations. In this way, Appendix C includes the extensive margin. As shown, all of the
results hold when using this large sample. Apparently, after a country starts enforcing its
insider trading laws, existing innovative industries start innovating more and formally noninnovative industries start innovating.
Third, we conduct a placebo test by examining the date that a country enacts insider
trading laws. As discussed, earlier work argues and finds that enforcement, not enactment,
curtails insider trading. Thus, if the reduction in insider trading stimulates innovation, we
should find that including the enactment date should neither affect the estimated impact of
Enforce nor should the enactment date provide much additional explanatory power. This is

26
what we find. As reported in Appendix D, the enactment of insider trading laws does not help
account for changes in the patent-based indicators and including the enactment date does not
alter the findings on Enforce.

4.2 Heterogeneous Responses by Industry
In this subsection, we evaluate cross-industry changes in innovative activity after a
country starts enforcing its insider trading laws and assess whether these patterns are
consistent with particular theoretical perspectives on how insider trading affects innovation.
In particular, one class of models emphasizes that the enforcement of insider trading laws
removes an impediment to the market more fully and accurately valuing innovative projects
and thereby encourages more investment in innovative activities that have positive net
present values (NPVs) when valued in a setting with no informational asymmetries between
corporate insiders and outsiders. From this perspective,, when a country starts enforcing its
insider trading laws, this should have a particularly positive impact on innovation in those
industries that had been most constrained by the absence of enforcement, such as (1)
naturally innovative industries that would have had much faster rates of innovation except for
the informational impediments created by the lack of effective limits on insider trading and
(2) naturally opaque industries that the market would have more precisely valued if there had
been effective restrictions on insider trading.

4.2.1 Differentiating by the natural innovativeness of industries
Based on equation (2), Table 6 presents our assessment of whether naturally
innovative industries experience larger increases in patent-based measures of innovation after
a country starts enforcing its insider trading laws than other industries. In each panel, there
are five regressions, where the dependent variable is one of the five patent-based measures.
The explanatory variable of interest is the interaction terms, High Tech*Enforce in Panel A
and Innovation Propensity*Enforce in Panel B, and the regressions also control for countryyear and industry-year fixed effects, as well as each country-industry’s exports to the U.S. in
each year.

27
As shown in Panel A, the patent-based measures of innovation rise much more in
high-tech industries after a country first enforces its insider trading laws. For example, Patent
Counts increase by 43% more in high-tech industries than in other industries, where a hightech industry is one in which the average annual growth rate of R&D expenses over the
sample period is greater than the median (using the U.S. to make these calculations for all
industries). The large wedge between high-tech and other industries holds for the other
patent-based measures. After a country first enforces its insider trading laws, high-tech
industries experience larger increases in Patenting Entities, Citations, Generality, and
Originality than other industries. By controlling for country-year effects, these results cannot
be attributed to other changes that occur in the country at the same time as the first
enforcement of insider trading unless those other changes also differentially affect industries
in precisely this manner. Similarly, by controlling for industry-year effects, these results are
not due to international increases in the rates of innovation in high-tech industries.
Panel B presents similarly strong results when differentiating industries by another
proxy for the degree to which an industry is naturally innovative—Innovation Propensity,
which equals one when the average number of patents per firm in the U.S. industry is greater
than the median. The interaction term, Innovation Propensity*Enforce enters each of the
regressions positively and significantly at the one percent level. The estimated effects are
large. For example, in an average industry in the subset of industries with Innovation
Propensity equal to one, Patent Count rises by 50% more than an average industry in the
subset of industries with Innovation Propensity equal to zero after a country starts enforcing
insider trading laws. These findings are also consistent with the valuation view of how the
enforcement of insider trading laws shapes innovation.

4.2.2 Differentiating by the natural opacity of industries
We next assess whether industries that are naturally opaque experience a bigger
increase in innovative activity after a country first enforces its insider trading laws. As
explained above, several models predict that enforcing insider trading laws will encourage
potential investors to expend more resources valuing firms, so that enforcement will have a

28
particularly positive impact on valuations—and hence innovation—in those industries in
which informational asymmetries had most severely impeded the full valuation of positive
NPV projects. As noted above, proxies for natural opacity might be correlated with the degree
to which an industry is naturally innovative. Thus, we do not claim to identify independently
the naturally innovative and opacity channels. Rather, we assess whether the enforcement of
insider trading laws has a more pronounced and positive impact on innovation in both
naturally innovative and opaque industries.
As reported in Table 7, we find that more opaque industries—as proxied by
Intangibility = 1 in Panel A—experience a much larger increase in innovation after the
enforcement of insider trading laws than other industries. Recall that Intangibility equals one
if the proportion of intangible to total assets among firms in an industry is greater than the
median industry (using U.S. data to categorize industries). The interaction term,
Intangibility*Enforce enters positively and significantly at the one percent level in the Patent
Count, Patent Entities, Citation, Generality, and Originality regressions. Furthermore, the
effect is large. Across the different patent-based measures of innovation, innovation increases
by 26% to 30% more in opaque industries than in other industries after a country starts
enforcing its insider trading laws.
Using the standard deviation of the market-to-book ratio, STD of MTB, as an
alternative proxy for informational opacity in Panel B, the results confirm the finding that
enforcement has a disproportionately large, positive effect on innovation in more opaque
industries. As defined above, STD of MTB equals one for industries in which the withinindustry standard deviation of the market-to-book ratio is above the median and zero
otherwise. The results indicate that industries in which STD of MTB equals one enjoy a bigger
increase in innovative activity after a country first enforces its insider trading laws than other
industries. In particular, STD of MTB*Enforce enters positively and significantly in the Patent
Count, Patent Entities, Citation, Generality, and Originality regressions, where the
regressions continue to control for country-year effects, industry-year effects, and Export to
US. These findings are consistent with theories emphasizing that the enforcement of insider
trading laws reduces the disincentives to expending resources on valuing projects and the

29
reduction of these disincentives will have an especially big impact on naturally innovative
and opaque industries. 10
We were concerned that the results might be driven by a particular group of countries.
For instance, perhaps the results are driven by either highly developed economies or highly
underdeveloped economies, in which a few additional patents after enforcement might have a
big impact on the estimated coefficients. We were also concerned the results could be driven
only by countries with highly developed or underdeveloped stock markets or only by
countries with market-oriented political ideologies. Thus, we conduct the analyses while
splitting the sample into several subgroup, including by the economic size of the economy
(median GDP), the level of economic development (median GDP per capita), the level of
stock market development (median Stock/GDP), and political orientation (, i.e., whether the
political orientation is more Right or more Center/Left). As shown in Appendix E, all of the
different patent-based measures of innovation rise appreciably in naturally innovative
industries after a country starts enforcing its insider trading laws across all of the subsamples

5. Equity Issuances
One channel through which the enforcement of insider trading laws may affect
innovation is by facilitating the issuance of equity. In particular, several theories emphasize
that effective constraints on insider trading will enhance the valuation of innovative activities
and thereby facilitate equity issuances by such firms. This can occur in several ways.
If innovators and investors can eventually capitalize on successful innovations by
issuing equity at prices that more fully value the innovation, this will foster investment in the
costly and risky process of creating those innovations. According to Aggarwal and Hsu
10

In unreported robustness tests, we examine the sensitivity of the Table 6 and Table 7 results to including

additional controls. In particular, we interact High Tech, Innovation Propensity, Intangibility, and STD of MTB
with the policy indicators used in Table 5 and add those interaction terms to the regressions in Table 6 and Table
7. We confirm that all of the results in Table 6 and Table 7 when adding these interaction terms. Consistent with
the view that enforcing insider trading laws improves valuations and these improvements have a particularly
large effect on naturally innovative and opaque industries, we find that High Tech*Enforce, Innovation
Propensity*Enforce, Intangibility*Enforce, and STD of MTB*Enforce continue to enter the innovation
regressions positively and significantly with similar point estimates as to those reported in Table 6 and Table 7.

30
(2014), initial public offerings (IPOs) and acquisitions by other entities are two major exit
routes that provide financial returns to entrepreneurs and investors. For start-ups, enforcing
insider trading laws can incentivize innovative endeavors ex ante by improving the expected
valuation during future IPOs. Similarly, for entrepreneurs that exit via acquisitions,
particularly in the form of stock swaps, enforcing insider trading laws can also encourage
innovative endeavors ex ante by increasing the expected prices of such acquisitions, as
reflected, for example, in the terms of future stock swaps. More generally, to the extent that
public acquirers can issue new shares that correctly price the innovations owned by target
companies, this increases the expect returns to potential targets from investing in innovation
in the first place.
Furthermore, the enforcement of insider trading laws can stimulate innovation by
facilitating seasoned equity offerings (SEOs). For publicly listed firms, effective insider
trading laws can increase the accuracy with which markets value innovative activities and
thereby facilitate SEOs. Having shown above that the enforcement of insider trading laws is
associated with a sharp increase in patenting activity in naturally innovative industries, we
now assess whether this is associated with a surge in equity issuances as well.
Motivated by these predictions, we test whether firms in naturally innovative
industries issue more equity than those in other industries after a country starts enforcing its
insider trading laws. To distinguish naturally innovative industries from other industries, we
again use High Tech and Innovation Propensity. We use nine measures of equity issuances.
For each industry-country-year, we calculate the natural logarithm of one plus the number of
IPOs (IPO Number), the natural logarithm of one plus the proceeds of those IPOs in U.S.
dollars (IPO Proceeds), and the natural logarithm of one plus the average amount raised (in
U.S. dollars) per IPO (Proceeds per IPO). We calculate similar measures for SEOs (SEO
Number, SEO Proceeds, and Proceeds per SEO) and for total of IPOs and SEOs in each
industry-country-year (Total Issue Number, Total Proceeds, and Proceeds per Issue).

31
Specifically, we estimate the following equation:
′
𝐸𝑞𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑐,𝑡 × 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖 + 𝜆𝑋𝑖,𝑐,𝑡
+ 𝛿𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛿𝑖,𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 ,

(4)

where Equity Issuancei,c,t is one of the nine measures of equity issuances and Industryi is
either High Tech or Innovation Propensity. We continue to include country-year and industryyear fixed effects and to control for the ratio of country-industry-year exports to the U.S. as a
share of the country’s total exports to the U.S. in that year (Export to US). Table 8 provides
the regression results. Panel A provides the results from nine regressions in which the
interaction term is Enforce*High Tech, while Panel B provides the results in which the
interaction term is Enforce*Innovation Propensity.
As shown in Table 8, equity issuances increase substantially more in naturally
innovative industries than in other industries after a country first enforces its insider trading
laws. Across the nine regressions in Panel A, the estimated coefficient on Enforce*High Tech
enters positively and significantly at the one percent level. The results are equally strong
when examining the interaction term of Enforce*Innovation Propensity in Panel B. In all
cases, the number of equity issuances, the amount raised through those issuances, and the
average size of the issuances all increase more in naturally innovative industries after insider
trading laws are first enforced. These results hold when considering IPOs, SEOs, or the total
number and value of issuances.
The estimated magnitudes are large. For example, the Table 8 estimates indicate that
enforcing insider trading laws is associated with 38% larger increase in IPO Proceeds in
industries in which Innovation Propensity equals one than in industries in which Innovation
Propensity equals zero. As another example, the reported estimates in Table 8 suggest that
when a country starts enforcing insider trading laws, this is associated with a 32% larger
boost in SEO Proceeds in industries with a naturally fast growth rate of R&D expenditures
(i.e., High Tech =1) as compared with other industries. The results are consistent with the
view that the enforcement of insider trading laws facilitates equity issuances by naturally
innovative industries.

32
6. Conclusion
In this paper, we provide evidence consistent with the view that legal systems that
protect outside investors from corporate insiders accelerate technological innovation. Based
on over 75,000 industry-country-year observations across 94 economies from 1976 to 2006,
we discover that patent intensity, scope, impact, generality, and originally of patenting
activity all rise markedly after a country first starts enforcing its insider trading laws.
Moreover, we find that the pattern of cross-industry changes in innovative activity is
consistent with theories emphasizing that when insiders can trade on non-public information
this dissuades other investors from expending the resources necessary for accurately valuing
innovative activities, which impedes the efficient allocation of capital to innovative
endeavors. In particular, several theories stress that the enforcement of insider trading laws
should have a particularly pronounced effect on (1) naturally innovative industries—
industries that would have experienced rapid innovation if insider trading had not impeded
accurate valuations—and (2) naturally opaque industries—industries that would experience
more investment if insider trading has not impeded accurate valuations. This is what we find.
The relationship between enforcing insider trading laws and innovation is much larger in
industries that are naturally innovative and opaque, where we use U.S. industries to
categorize industries by innovativeness and opacity.
Moreover, our findings on equity issuances emphasizes that restricting insider trading
boosts equity issuances, especially among firms in naturally innovative industries. To the
extent that insider trading impedes the ability of markets to accurately value innovative
activities and the resulting informational asymmetry impedes the ability of such firms to issue
equity, we should find that restricting insider trading facilitates equity issuances by such
firms. This is what we find. We discover that industries that are naturally more innovative
experience a much bigger increase in IPOs and SEOs after a country starts enforcing its
insider trading laws than other types of industries.
The results in this paper contribute to a large and emerging body of evidence
suggesting that laws, regulations, and enforcement mechanisms that foster transparency,
integrity, and broad participation enhance the functioning of financial systems with positive

33
ramifications on economic activity, as discussed in Barth et al. (2006), La Porta et al. (2008),
and Beck et al. (2010). We find that legal systems that impede insider trading and thereby
encourage investors to acquire information and value firms more accurately exert a material
impact on innovation. Since innovation is vital for sustaining improvements in living
standards, these results highlight the centrality of financial market policies for promoting
economic prosperity.

patent offices in one of the member countries of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and/or European
Patent Office (EPO) in year t by applicants in country c; if there are
more than one patent for a particular invention (i.e. multiple patents
being part of the same DOCDB patent family), either the citing
invention or the cited one, we only count one citation regardless of the
actual patent(s) citing or being cited between two patent families, and
we use the bibliographic information of the first patent in a patent
family to determine the year, the International Patent Classification
(IPC) subclass and the country of the invention; since citations beyond
the coverage of PATSTAT (i.e., the full years after 2014) are not
observed, we adjust for the actually-observed citation count of a patent
family granted after 1985 by dividing it by the weighting factor
corresponding to its IPC section (K) and the lag between its year of
�𝐾𝐿 , where 𝑆�𝐾𝐿 is the

estimated cumulative share of citations having been received since the
grant of the patent in IPC section K for L years over a 30-year lifetime;
we calculate 𝑆𝐾𝐿 based on the patents granted in each of the ten years
between 1976-1985 respectively (1985 is the last year with 30 years’
�𝐾𝐿 as the average across the ten estimates for
observations) and define 𝑆
each K each L; citations to patent families granted on and before 1985
are not adjusted; then, the (adjusted) citation count is summed over all

Industry Characteristics
The ratio of each industry's export to the U.S. over its country's total
export to the U.S. in each year; the data is provided at the Standard
International Trade Classification level (SITC Rev1) and we map it to
the two-digit SIC level via Harmonized System (H0) using the
concordance schemes provided by the World Bank
http://wits.worldbank.org/product_concordance.html
An indicator variable based on the high-tech intensiveness of each
two-digit SIC industry; we first calculate the average annual
percentage growth of R&D expenses (Compustat item xrd) over all the
U.S. public firms in each industry-year; then we use the time-series
average within each industry over the sample period (1976-2006) as
the measurement of high-tech intensiveness at industry level; High
Tech is set to 1 if it is above the sample median and 0 otherwise.
An indicator variable based on the innovation propensity measure for
each two-digit SIC industry; we first calculate the average number of
patents filed by a U.S. firm in each three-digit U.S. technological class
in each year; we then calculate the time-series average within each
technological class over the sample period (1976-2006); after
obtaining the measurement at the three-digit technological class, we
convert it to the two-digit SIC level using the mapping scheme
provided by Hsu et al. (2014); Innovation Propensity is set to 1 if it is
above the sample median and 0 otherwise.
An indicator variable based on the intangibility of each two-digit SIC
industry: we first calculate the average ratio of Plant, Property and
Equipment (PPE) (Compustat item ppent) over total assets (Compustat
item at) across all the U.S. public firms in an industry-year; we then
use the time-series average within each industry over the sample
period (1976-2006); we next compute one minus the PPE/Asset ratio
as the proxy for intangibility in each industry; Intangibility is set to 1 if
it is above the sample median and 0 otherwise.
An indicator variable based on the standard-deviation of market-tobook equity ratio in each two-digit SIC industry: we first calculate the
standard deviation of market-to-book ratio (Compustat item
(csho×prcc)/ceq) across all the U.S. public firms in each industryyear; we then compute the time-series average within each industry
over the sample period (1976-2006); we next divide the dispersion of
market-to-book ratio at industry-level by the average market-to-book
ratio in the same industry, where the denominator is firm-level marketto-book ratio averaged within each industry-year and then across
industry-years; MTB_STD is set to 1 if it is above the sample median
and 0 otherwise.
Equity Issuance Activities

Table 2 Summary Statistics
This table presents the unweighted summary statistics across all the observations within the sample period 19762006. Patent Count* is defined as the total number of eventually-granted patent applications belonging to
industry i that are filed in year t by applicants from country c. Patent Entities* is the total number of distinct
entities in country c, that apply for patents in industry i in year t. Citation* is the total number of citations to
patent families in industry i, in country c, and in year t, where t is the application year. Generality* and
Originality* are the sum of the generality and originality scores of all the patents in industry i that are filed in
year t by applicants from country c respectively. Patent Count, Patent Entities, Citation, Generality and
Originality are the natural logarithm of one plus the respective values of Patent Count*, Patent Entities*,
Citation*, Generality*, and Originality*. We restrict to patents filed and granted by the patent offices in one of
the 34 OECD countries and/or EPO and we work with patent families to define patent-based measures of
innovation. Country-level economic characteristics include GDP, GDP per capita (both in natural logarithm),
equity/credit market development (Stock/GDP, Credit/GDP), international trade (Trade/GDP), and a series of
measures of financial liberalization policies; country-level legal and political factors include legal origin
(Common Law), the extent of democracy (Polity), legislature fractionalization (Fractionalization), and political
orientation of the largest party in the government (Right, Central, Left). Industry-level variables include the
share of industry’s export over total export to the U.S. (Export to US) and a series of U.S.-based industry
indicators representing different natural rate of innovation (High Tech and Innovation Propensity) and
information opacity (Intangibility and STD of MTB). Industry-level equity issuance activities include the number
of equity issuance (IPO Number, SEO Number and Total Issue Number), total proceeds from equity issuance
(IPO Proceeds, SEO Proceeds and Total Proceeds) and proceeds per issuance (Proceeds per IPO, Proceeds per
SEO and Proceeds per Issue), respectively measured for total equity issuance (both IPO and SEO), IPO and
SEO, which are all transformed into the natural logarithm of one plus the original value. Except for countrylevel variables, whose summary statistics are calculate over country-year observations, the summary statistics of
all other variables are calculated over all the industry-country-year observations. Table 1 provides detailed
definitions of the variables.

Table 3 Timing of Insider Trading Law Enforcement and Pre-existing Innovation:
Hazard Model Estimation
This table shows the estimated effect of country-level patent-based measures of innovation before the initial
enforcement of the insider trading laws on the expected time to the initial enforcement based on Weibull
distribution of the hazard rate. Patent Count c is the natural logarithm of one plus the total number of eventuallygranted patent applications filed in year t by applicants from country c. Patent Entities c is the natural logarithm
of one plus the total number of distinct entities in country c that apply for patents in year t. Citation c is the
natural logarithm of one plus the total number of citations to patent families in country c, and in year t, where t
is the application year. Generality c and Originality c are the natural logarithm of one plus the sum of the
generality and originality scores of all the patents that are filed in year t by applicants from country c,
respectively. Counties that enforced the insider trading laws before 1976 are excluded from the duration model
analysis. Among the remaining countries, we treat those without law enforcement within our sample period as
always “at risk” of enforcing the law; for those with law enforcement within our sample period, they drop out of
the sample once the law was enforced. Control variables are grouped into economic, legal and political factors.
Measurements of economic development include GDP, GDP per capita, Stock/GDP and Credit/GDP.
Measurements of legal and political environment include 1) an indicator variable for legal origins (Common
Law) that equals one if a country has common law origin; 2) the composite index of democracy and autocracy
(Polity), ranging from -10 (strongly autocratic) to +10 (strongly democratic); it is obtained from the Polity IV
Database; 3) legislature fractionalization (Fractionalization), defined as the probability that two deputies picked
at random from the legislature will be of different parties; it is obtained from the Database of Political Institution
(Beck et al., 2001); 4) three indicator variables representing political orientation of the largest party in the
government: right-wing / conservative / Christian democratic (Right), centrist (Central) and left-wing / socialist
/ communist / social democrat (Left), where Left serves as the base group; they are obtained from the Database
of Political Institution. Robust z-statistics are reported in parenthesis, which are based on standard errors
clustered at country level. ***, **, * denote significance levels at 1%, 5% and 10% respectively.

Table 4 Insider Trading Law Enforcement and Innovation: Baseline
This table presents the baseline panel regression results of the initial enforcement of insider trading laws on the
innovative activities measured at the industry-country level using the following specification: Innovation𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 =
𝛼0 + 𝛼1 Enforce𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛾𝑋′𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛿𝑐 + 𝛿𝑖 + 𝛿𝑡 + ε𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 . Enforce is the key explanatory variable, which is equal to
one for years after the law is enforced for the first time in a country. The dependent variable, Innovation, is one
of the five patent-based measures of innovation. Patent Count is the natural logarithm of one plus the total
number of patent applications belonging to industry i that are filed in year t by applicants from country c. Patent
Entities is the natural logarithm of one plus the total number of distinct entities in country c that apply for
patents in industry i in year t. Citation is the natural logarithm of one plus the total number of truncationadjusted citations to patent families in industry i, in country c, and in year t, where t is the application year.
Generality and Originality are the natural logarithm of one plus the sum of either the generality or originality
score of all the patents in industry i that are filed in year t by applicants from country c. Control variables
include GDP, GDP per capita, Stock/GDP, Credit/GDP and Export to US. Table 1 provides detailed definitions
of the variables. Robust t-statistics are reported in parenthesis, which are based on standard errors clustered at
the country and year level. ***, **, * denote significance levels at 1%, 5% and 10% respectively.

Table 5 Insider Trading Law Enforcement and Innovation: Controlling for Policy Changes
This table presents the effect of the enforcement of insider trading laws on innovation, controlling for other
policy changes and reforms for financial liberalization (FL). We follow the following
′
+ δc + δi + δt + ε𝑖,c,t . We use an
specification: Innovation𝑖,c,t = β0 + β1 Enforcec,t + β2 FL𝑐,𝑡 + 𝜆𝑋𝑖,𝑐,𝑡
assortment of FL measures from columns 1) to 9): 1) Credit Control evaluates the restrictiveness of reserve
requirements, existence of mandatory credit allocation and credit ceilings, ranging from 0 (i.e., fully repressed)
to 3 (fully liberalized); 2) Interest Rate Control measures the extent of interest rate liberalization, with 0, 1, 2, 3
indicates fully repressed, partially repressed, largely liberalized and fully liberalized, respectively; 3) Entry
Barriers captures the ease of foreign bank entry and the extent of competition in the domestic banking sector
(e.g., restrictions on branching), which also ranges from 0 to 3, indicating the least liberalized to the fully
liberalized; 4) Bank Supervision measures the degree of supervision over the banking sector, ranging from 0 (not
regulated) to 3 (highly regulated); 5) Bank Privatization proxies the presence of state ownership, ranging from 0
to 3, where 0 means the highest level of state ownership (i.e., full repressed), while 3 means the lowest (i.e.,
fully liberalized); 6) Capital Control evaluates the restrictions on international capital flow, ranging from 0 (i.e.,
fully repressed) to 3 (fully liberalized); 7) Securities Market evaluates measures to develop securities market and
restrictions on the foreign equity ownership, ranging from 0 (i.e., fully depressed) to 3 (i.e., fully liberalized); 8)
Financial Reform Index is the sum of the previous seven variables; Variables in columns 1)-8) are obtained from
IMF, available for a maximum of 71 countries in our sample ; 9) Liberal Capital Markets is defined as one after
a country officially liberalized its capital market and zero otherwise (i.e. formal regulatory change after which
foreign investors officially have the opportunity to invest in domestic equity securities), where the official
liberalization date is obtained from Bekaert and Harvey (2000) and augmented with Bekaert, Harvey and
Lundblad (2005) for 68 countries in our sample. Control variables include GDP, GDP per capita, Stock/GDP,
Credit/GDP and Export to US. Table 1 provides detailed definitions of the variables. Robust t-statistics are
reported in parenthesis, which are based on standard errors clustered at the country and year level. ***, **, *
denote significance levels at 1%, 5% and 10% respectively.

Table 6 Insider Trading Law Enforcement and Innovation: By Natural Rate of Innovation
This table shows the differential effects of the enforcement of insider trading laws on the innovative activities
across industries that are characterized with different natural rate of innovation. We use the following
′
+ δc,t + δ𝑖,t + ε𝑖,c,t (Panel A) and
specifications: Innovation𝑖,c,t = β0 + β1 Enforcec,t × High Tech𝑖 + 𝜆𝑋𝑖,𝑐,𝑡
′
Innovation𝑖,c,t = β0 + β1 Enforcec,t × Innovation Propensity𝑖 + 𝜆𝑋𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 + δc,t + δ𝑖,t + ε𝑖,c,t (Panel B). Enforce
is a dummy variable set equal to one for years after the law is enforced for the first time in a country. High Tech
is a dummy variable set equal to one if the measurement of high-tech intensiveness at the two-digit SIC is above
the sample median and zero otherwise; High-tech intensiveness is defined as the average growth rate of R&D
expense over the sample period in each industry benchmarked to the U.S. Innovation Propensity is a dummy
variable set to one if the measurement of innovation propensity at the two-digit SIC is above the sample median
and zero otherwise; innovation propensity is defined as the average number of patents filed by a U.S. firm in a
particular industry over the sample period. The dependent variable, Innovation, is one of the five patent-based
measures of innovation. Patent Count is the natural logarithm of one plus the total number of patent applications
belonging to industry i that are filed in year t by applicants from country c. Patent Entities is the natural
logarithm of one plus the total number of distinct entities in country c, that apply for patents in industry i in year
t. Citation is the natural logarithm of one plus the total number of truncation-adjusted citations to patent families
in industry i, in country c, and in year t, where t is the application year. Generality and Originality are the
natural logarithm of one plus the sum of either the generality or originality score of all the patents in industry i
that are filed in year t by applicants from country c. Control variable is Export to US and other characteristics
are subsumed by the country-year dummies δc,t and industry-year dummies δ𝑖,t . Table 1 provides detailed
definitions of the variables. Robust t-statistics are reported in parenthesis, which are based on standard errors
clustered at the country and year level. ***, **, * denote significance levels at 1%, 5% and 10% respectively.

Table 7 Insider Trading Law Enforcement on Innovation: By Information Asymmetry
This table demonstrates the differential effects of the enforcement of insider trading laws on the innovative
activities across industries that are characterized with different extent of information asymmetry. The

specification follows: Innovation𝑖,c,t = β0 + β1 Enforcec,t × Intangibility𝑖 + 𝜆𝑋𝑖,𝑐,𝑡
′
A) and Innovation𝑖,c,t = β0 + β1 Enforcec,t × STD of MTB𝑖 + 𝜆𝑋𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 + δc,t + δ𝑖,t + ε𝑖,c,t (Panel B). Enforce is a
dummy variable set equal to one for years after the law is enforced for the first time in a country. Intangibility is
a dummy variable set to one if intangibility measurement at the two-digit SIC is above the sample median and
zero otherwise; we measure intangibility as one minus PPE/Asset ratio of each industry benchmarked to the
U.S. STD of MTB is a dummy variable set to one if the standardized valuation dispersion at the two-digit SIC is
above the sample median and zero otherwise; it is measured as the standard deviation of market-to-book equity
ratio over the average market-to-book equity ratio within each industry benchmarked to the U.S. The dependent
variable, Innovation, is one of the five patent-based measures of innovation. Patent Count is defined as the
natural logarithm of one plus the total number of patent applications belonging to industry i that are filed in year
t by applicants from country c. Patent Entities is the natural logarithm of one plus the total number of distinct
entities in country c, that apply for patents in industry i in year t. Citation is the natural logarithm of one plus the
total number of truncation-adjusted citations to patent families in industry i, in country c, and in year t, where t
is the application year. Generality and Originality are the natural logarithm of one plus the sum of either the
generality or originality score of all the patents in industry i that are filed in year t by applicants from country c.
Control variable is Export to US and other characteristics are subsumed by the country-year dummies δc,t and
industry-year dummies δ𝑖,t . Table 1 provides detailed definitions of the variables. Robust t-statistics are
reported in parenthesis, which are based on standard errors clustered at the country and year level. ***, **, *

Equity Issuance𝑖,c,t = β0 + β1 Enforcec,t × Innovation Propensity𝑖 + 𝜆𝑋𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 + δc,t + δ𝑖,t + ε𝑖,c,t in Panels A and B respectively. The dependent variable takes the natural
logarithm of one plus the number, proceeds or proceeds per deal of equity issuance via IPO, SEO or the two activities combined (total) respectively in an industry-countryyear. Enforce is a dummy variable set equal to one for years after the law is enforced for the first time in a country. Control variable is Export to US and other characteristics
are subsumed by the country-year dummies δc,t and industry-year dummies δ𝑖,t . Robust t-statistics are reported in parenthesis, which are based on standard errors clustered at

Figure 1 Timing of Insider Trading Law Enforcement and Pre-existing Innovation
The set of figures plot the average level of innovation and the average rate of change in innovation before the initial
enforcement of the insider trading laws against the year of the initial enforcement. Innovation takes one of the five
patent-based measures of innovation at country level: Patent Count c, Patent Entities c, Citation c, Generality c and
Originality c respectively. Table 1 provides detailed definitions of the variables. Only countries with enforcement of
insider trading laws within our sample period 1976-2006 are plotted in the figures.

Appendix A Country-level Information of Insider Trading Laws and Innovation
This table presents basic information on the enactment year (Exist Year) and enforcement year (Enforce Year) of the
insider trading laws, together with summary statistics of the patent-based measures of innovation by country. There
are a total of 94 countries in the full sample between 1976 and 2006 (U.S. is included for illustration purpose).
Patent Count* is the total number of eventually-granted patent applications belonging to industry i that are filed in
year t by applicants from country c. Patent Entities* is the total number of distinct entities in country c, that apply
for patents in industry i in year t. Citation* is the total number of citations to patent families in industry i, in country
c, and in year t, where t is the application year. Generality* and Originality* are the sum of the generality and
originality scores, respectively of all the patents in industry i that are applied in year t by applicants from country c.
We restrict to patents filed and granted by the patent offices in one of the 34 OECD countries and/or EPO and we
work with patent families to define the patent-based measures of innovation. When reporting the summary statistics
for each country of these patent-based measures of innovation, we take the unweighted average across industry-year
observations within the sample period 1976-2006. Industry-country-year without patent information is not included
in the sample. Industry is defined on two-digit SIC. Table 1 provides detailed definitions of the variables.

Appendix B Insider Trading Law Enforcement and Innovation:
Robustness with Country-industry and Year Fixed Effects
In this table, we present the robustness test results of baseline analysis using country-industry and year fixed effects.
We use the following specification: Innovation𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 = 𝛼0 + 𝛼1 Enforce𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛾𝑋′𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛿𝑐,𝑖 + 𝛿𝑡 + ε𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 . Enforce is
equal to one for years after the law is enforced for the first time in a country. The dependent variable, Innovation, is
one of the five patent-based measures of innovation. Patent Count is the natural logarithm of one plus the total
number of patent applications belonging to industry i that are filed in year t by applicants from country c. Patent
Entities is the natural logarithm of one plus the total number of distinct entities in country c that apply for patents in
industry i in year t. Citation is the natural logarithm of one plus the total number of truncation-adjusted citations to
patent families in industry i, in country c, and in year t, where t is the application year. Generality and Originality
are the natural logarithm of one plus the sum of either the generality or originality score of all the patents in industry
i that are filed in year t by applicants from country c. Control variables include GDP, GDP per capita, Stock/GDP,
Credit/GDP and Export to US. Table 1 provides detailed definitions of the variables. Robust t-statistics are reported
in parenthesis, which are based on standard errors clustered at the country and year level. ***, **, * denote
significance levels at 1%, 5% and 10% respectively.

Appendix C Insider Trading Law Enforcement and Innovation: Robustness at Extensive Margin
This table presents robustness test results of the baseline analysis based on the sample with both intensive and
extensive margin, where we include industry-country-years when no patents are filed and assign a value of zero to
them. We use the following specification: Innovation𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 = 𝛼0 + 𝛼1 Enforce𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛾𝑋′𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛿𝑐 + 𝛿𝑖 + 𝛿𝑡 + ε𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 .
Enforce is equal to one for years after the law is enforced for the first time in a country. The dependent variable,
Innovation, is one of the five patent-based measures of innovation. Patent Count is the natural logarithm of one plus
the total number of patent applications belonging to industry i that are filed in year t by applicants from country c.
Patent Entities is the natural logarithm of one plus the total number of distinct entities in country c that apply for
patents in industry i in year t. Citation is the natural logarithm of one plus the total number of truncation-adjusted
citations to patent families in industry i, in country c, and in year t, where t is the application year. Generality and
Originality are the natural logarithm of one plus the sum of either the generality or originality score of all the patents
in industry i that are filed in year t by applicants from country c. Control variables include GDP, GDP per capita,
Stock/GDP, Credit/GDP and Export to US. Table 1 provides detailed definitions of the variables. Robust t-statistics
are reported in parenthesis, which are based on standard errors clustered at the country and year level. ***, **, *

Appendix D Insider Trading Law Enactment and Innovation: Robustness
In this table we present the robustness tests of the baseline analysis including the enactment events of insider trading laws. We follow the following specification:
Innovation𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 = 𝛼0 + 𝛼1 Enact𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛾𝑋′𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛿𝑐 + 𝛿𝑖 + 𝛿𝑡 + ε𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 and Innovation𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 = 𝛼0 + 𝛼1 Enact𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛼2 Enforce𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛾𝑋′𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 + 𝛿𝑐 + 𝛿𝑖 + 𝛿𝑡 + ε𝑖,𝑐,𝑡 . Enact
is equal to one for years after the law is enacted in a country; Enforce is equal to one for years after the law is enforced for the first time in a country. The
dependent variable, Innovation, is one of the five patent-based measures of innovation. Patent Count is the natural logarithm of one plus the total number of
patent applications belonging to industry i that are filed in year t by applicants from country c. Patent Entities is the natural logarithm of one plus the total
number of distinct entities in country c that apply for patents in industry i in year t. Citation is the natural logarithm of one plus the total number of truncationadjusted citations to patent families in industry i, in country c, and in year t, where t is the application year. Generality and Originality are the natural logarithm
of one plus the sum of either the generality or originality score of all the patents in industry i that are filed in year t by applicants from country c. Control
variables include GDP, GDP per capita, Stock/GDP, Credit/GDP and Export to US. Table 1 provides detailed definitions of the variables. Robust t-statistics are
reported in parenthesis, which are based on standard errors clustered at the country and year level. ***, **, * denote significance levels at 1%, 5% and 10%
respectively.
