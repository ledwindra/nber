Bribery or Just Desserts? Evidence on the Influence of Congressional Voting Patterns on PAC
Contributions from Exogenous Variation in the Sex Mix of Legislator Offspring

ABSTRACT
Evidence on the relationship between political contributions and legislators' voting behavior is marred
by concerns about endogeneity in the estimation process. Using a legislator's offspring sex mix as
an exogenous variable, we employ a two-stage least squares estimation procedure to predict the effect
of voting behavior on political contributions. Following previous research, we find that a legislator's
proportion daughters has a significant effect on voting behavior for women's issues, as measured by
score in the "Congressional Record on Choice" issued by NARAL Pro-Choice America. In the second
stage, we make a unique contribution by demonstrating a significant impact of exogenous voting behavior
on PAC contributions, lending credibility to the hypothesis that Political Action Committees respond
to legislators' voting patterns by "rewarding" political candidates that vote in line with the positions
of the PAC, rather than affecting or "bribing" those same votes -- at least in this high profile policy
domain.

Just Desserts? Offspring Sex Mix and Political Donations

INTRODUCTION:
The relationship between Congressional voting behavior and political
contributions remains a continuing puzzle for social scientists interested in the American
political process. We know that there is a high correlation between how legislators vote
and how they are rated by interested Political Action Committees (PACs) on the one
hand, and the amount of donations that legislators receive from these lobbyist groups, on
the other. Using the data from NARAL Pro-Choice America in this paper, for instance,
Table 1 illustrates the high correlation between PAC contributions from NARAL in a
given election cycle and voting scores assigned by the organization for the previous
Congressional session.

<< Insert Table 1 here >>

However, though of critical importance to understanding the role of money in the
lawmaking process, sorting out causal directionality here is extremely difficult
methodologically. To what extent do contributions from political action committees
(PACs) actually influence the voting patterns of elected officials – a particularly
worrisome dynamic from the point of view of those concerned with influence peddling?
Or, conversely, to what extent do the voting record and ideological commitments of an
elected official influence his or her PAC contributions – a “rewards” based system of
political patronage that may still be troubling to those concerned with the influence of
money on democracy but which is less blatantly a bribery system?

While most research attempting to disentangle these possibilities has focused on
estimating the former dynamic, this paper examines the latter – namely, the extent to
which PAC contributions are used as “rewards” for legislators that support PACs
position. We focus on PAC donations since such campaign contributions are explicitly
linked to a legislative agenda; in the conclusion, we discuss the generalizability of this
sector to political donations more generally (i.e. from private individuals, corporations,
unions and other donor groups). Concerns about generalizability of PAC money aside,
PAC donations are interesting to explore in their own right as they represent a significant
share of the total amount of campaign donations received by members of the U.S.
Congress. As shown in Figure 1, approximately 40% of monies received by candidates
in recent election cycles for the U.S. House of Representatives comes from Political
Action Committees.

<< Insert Figure 1 >>

In absolute terms, the amount of money donated by PACs to successful House candidates
has nearly doubled in the last ten years. As Table 2 and Figure 2 illustrate, successful
House candidates collected approximately $300,000 from Political Action Committees in
1998. By 2006, the average amount collected by successful House candidates reached
nearly $550,000. Similarly, the largest PAC receipts for a single successful House
candidate doubled from $1.2 million to $2.4 million during this period.

While PAC contributions comprise an increasing share of funding in American
elections, the proliferation of Political Action Committees has been equally spectacular.
According the Federal Election Commission, the number of registered PACs increased
five-fold between 1975 and 2000. This growth has been particularly spectacular amongst
corporate PACs, which comprise nearly two-fifths of PACs registered with the Federal
Election Commission in 1999. Table 3 details the annual growth of Political Action
Committees, and Figure 3 charts their astronomical rise by reported sector.

<< Insert Figure 3 >>
<< Insert Table 3 >>

The growth of Political Action Committees occurred contemporaneously with
increased concerns amongst the electorate about the role of money in our political
system. Anecdotal evidence suggests--and recent public opinion polls confirm--that the
pervasiveness of money in the nation’s political process is viewed as a serious concern.
For instance, a 2000 Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll found that over 80% of
respondents believed Political Action Committees wielded too much power and influence
in Washington. Similarly, over half of adults surveyed in a 2000 Newsweek poll claimed
that the influence of political contributions on government policy was a major problem in
Washington.

These polls underscore concern amongst the electorate about the influence of money in
the policymaking process. Taken together, the growth of Political Action Committees,
their prevalence in financing political campaigns, and mounting concern about the
influence of money and politics justify the scope of this study.

BACKGROUND:
Despite the enormity of the scale of political donations and the seriousness of the
issue, both from a theoretical perspective as well as from the point of view of public
concern about the potential ‘tainting’ of the political process, determining the direction of
causality between political contributions and voting behavior remains elusive. The
majority of research on this subject examines the hypothesis that financial contributions
from political action committees influence the voting decisions of members of Congress
(see Grenzke 1989a; Grenzke 1989b).
One theory, for example, suggests that over and above other important factors
such as party affiliation (Stratmann 1996; Rudolph 1999), seniority (Grenzke 1989a),
committee assignments (Grier and Munger 1993; Grier and Munger 1991; Evans 1988)
and other legislator characteristics, ideological ‘fence-sitters’ should elicit the greatest
financial support in a ‘bidding war’ of sorts for their swing votes on important issues. In
terms of individual legislator characteristics, this theory predicts that moderates, rather
than committed liberals or conservatives, are most susceptible to influence peddling from

6

Conley & McCabe

PACs. Fleischer (1993) concludes that his results on the impact of defense PACs on
defense spending “indicate that contributions from defense PACs can under certain
circumstances marginally influence the votes of members, especially those members with
weaker ideological predispositions.” (Fleischer 1993: 406) Those without clear,
consistent policy positions are viewed as most swayable, and political contributions are
aimed at influencing these legislators’ voting behavior.
Yet, other recent empirical evidence suggests the opposite – that a consistent
ideological position is associated with high campaign contributions. In a recent NBER
working paper, Kroszner and Stratmann (2000) find that a clear, well-known ideological
position increases campaign contributions. Using the percent of repeat givers as a proxy
for a legislator’s reputational development, Kroszner and Stratmann (2000) report that
“high reputational development is rewarded with high total contributions.” (Kroszner and
Stratmann 2000: 25) In their analysis, contributions from PACs increase as legislators
build their reputational clarity, suggesting that this consistent ideological positioning
benefits legislators. Such a result suggests that rather than ‘buying’ votes directly,
political contributors may tend to invest in legislators who will provide ‘sure’ returns
based on prior patterns.1
Net of individual legislator characteristics, the literature suggests that PACs
should be most influential in low profile, non-ideological issues. Again, Fleisher (1993)
tests the effect of political contributions from organizations involved in the national

1

These conclusions build on earlier attempts to understand the effect of ideological positioning on
campaign contributions. Some research leaves out the ideology variable because of its multicolinearity with
political party affiliation (Grenzke 1988). Other research includes an aggregate measure of ideology, such
as the Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) score for each legislator, and finds significant effects of
ideology on PAC contributions (Evans 1988; Borck 1996).

defense industry. Using a two-stage least squares estimation procedure to overcome the
simultaneity of defense PAC donations and voting behavior, Fleisher predicts PAC
contributions using characteristics of individual legislators and their districts in his
model, including a legislator’s campaign receipts from other PACs. In the second stage,
this instrumented variable for defense PAC contributions is used to predict support for
defense legislation in the 100th Congress. While Fleisher concludes, along with existing
literature, that ideology plays a powerful role in explaining voting behavior, he also finds
a significant effect of defense PAC contributions, although the magnitude of this effect is
small. Unfortunately, the variables Fleisher claims to be exogenous in the first stage (e.g.,
ideology, contracts received from the Defense Department, party, etc.) in predicting
defense PAC contributions do not meet the exclusion restriction; in other words, we
should expect all those factors to affect voting on defense issues independent of
donations.
Likewise, Grenzke (1989b) finds that political contributions are unlikely to
change voting behavior, even for low profile, niche issues. In the first stage, Grenzke
predicts PAC contributions from a host of variables, including electoral vulnerability and
member’s power (Grenzke 1989b: 8). Grenzke lags the effect of political contributions by
using contributions in both the simultaneous year and the preceding year to when the
behavior was measured. In other words, for voting during the 95th Congress (19771978), Grenzke uses both contributions during the 1977-1978 election cycle, as well as
during the 1975-1976 election cycle. Of twenty-nine models, Grenzke finds only four
significant associations in the simultaneous relationship and one significant association in
the lagged relationship. As a result, Grenzke concludes that “contributions from 120

8

Conley & McCabe

Just Desserts? Offspring Sex Mix and Political Donations

PACs affiliated with 10 large interest groups generally do not maintain or change House
members’ voting patterns.” (Grenzke 1989b: 19) As with Fleisher’s study, Grenzke’s
instrument (electoral vulnerability) fails the second-stage exclusion restriction, as we
would expect that variables like electoral vulnerability to affect both PAC contributions
(if more vulnerable incumbents are on the prowl for money) and voting behavior (if
electoral vulnerability makes incumbents more likely to vote in ways appealing to
particular constituencies that may, for example, stimulate job growth in their districts).
In addition to examining high-visibility and low-visibility issues separately, Grier
and Munger (1993) argue that institutional context matters. In the House, where much of
the legislative work is performed in committee, committee assignments are significant
predictors of campaign contributions; in the Senate, on the other hand, party affiliation
plays a more significant role in determining contributions. Witko (2006) builds on this
analysis by arguing that the “issue context” matters. Using probit analysis to measure
the effect of PAC contributions on ideological, visible issues versus non-ideological, nonvisible issues, he argues that contributions influence voting behavior on non-visible
issues, but influence measures of participation on more visible ones. These measures of
participation include the number of times a legislator participates in a committee hearing,
the number of amendments submitted by legislators, and the number of lines of text
added by legislators to hearing transcripts. Thus, Witko challenges the traditional
explanation that PAC contributions matter for non-ideological, non-visible issues. He
argues instead that, for visible, ideological issues, PAC contributions matter earlier in the
legislative process, when legislators are participating in committee hearings and offering
legislative amendments. (Witko 2006: 289) This analysis leads to a more nuanced

9

Conley & McCabe

Just Desserts? Offspring Sex Mix and Political Donations

understanding of the impact of campaign contributions on political behavior by
suggesting that researchers must examine committee participation, as well as actual
voting behavior.
While Witko (2006) offers an alternative to the money-votes linkage by
suggesting that political contributions are linked with other forms of legislator
participation, recent experimental evidence on the relationship between contributions and
access suggests otherwise. Chin (2005) conducted an experiment in which Congressional
schedulers were given a set of hypothetical schedule requests, along with a weekly
schedule for a member of Congress. These staff members are asked to schedule the
member of Congress, based on the set of letters and requests available to the scheduler.
Using a variety of experimental conditions, Chin (2005) concludes that it is constituency
status, rather than campaign contribution history, that significantly affects the likelihood
of a scheduling request being accepted. While this experimental study may be of limited
external validity due to the hypothetical nature of the research, it does suggest that
political contributions may not be paramount in gaining access to legislators.
In another effort to get at the heart of the relationship between voting behavior
and political contributions, Bronars and Lott (1997) examine the voting behavior of
retiring members of Congress in their final term in Congress. If the need for campaign
donations to secure reelection impacts legislative behavior, then the decision to retire –
and subsequently stop receiving political contributions – should change the voting
behavior of members by freeing them from such considerations to instead purely vote
their conscience. They find no evidence for this hypothesis, thereby calling into dispute
the notion that political contributions affect voting behavior. However, it could be the

10

Conley & McCabe

Just Desserts? Offspring Sex Mix and Political Donations

case that PACs have already ‘trapped’ retiring legislators into a path-dependent voting
record that conditions votes during that member’s final Congressional term; or that the
retiring member is responsive to the same lobbying forces but this time with the carrot of
a lucrative position in the private sector post-retirement; or that the member is voting to
maximize donations to his/her anointed successor in an implicit bargain.
The evidence presented thus far—both from experimental research examining the
relationship between money and access, as well as the quantitative research linking
political donations to voting behavior—may allay the fears of those concerned with the
‘buying’ of votes through campaign donations by political action committees. If the
causal relationship between donations and voting is weak, we should expect that the
‘residual’ impact of voting on donations is strong to account for the high overall
correlation. With this expectation in mind, the present study tries to quantify the extent
to which voting patterns of a legislator during a given Congress affects the donations of a
particular PAC to that member in the subsequent election cycle. Of course, merely
deploying temporal ordering does not satisfy the condition of strict (or even weak)
exogeneity in a time series analysis. For example, it could be that members of Congress
vote a certain way in anticipation of (i.e. fishing for) donations from a PAC (or perhaps
as a result of explicit or implicit promises). Clearly, such a dynamic would be troubling
from the point of view of the democratic process just as much as simultaneous exchange
of money for votes or prior donations driving future votes.
To preempt this issue, we employ a unique estimation strategy: We use
exogenous variation in the sex mix of legislators’ children to predict their voting patterns
on certain issues. Sex mix has been used as an instrument for parental labor force

11

Conley & McCabe

Just Desserts? Offspring Sex Mix and Political Donations

participation (Angrist and Evans 1998), for parental divorce ( Dahl and Moretti 2004),
and for parental investment in offspring (Conley and Glauber 2006). The appeal of this
instrument lies in its random assignment in a country—like the U.S.—where there is little
to no antenatal sex selection (i.e. sex selective abortion).
This utilization of the random variation provided by the sex-mix of offspring to
predict voting patterns becomes the first stage in an IV-regression of lagged voting on
political contributions, thereby providing us with a ‘clean’ estimate of the impact of
voting on donation. Specifically, we follow Washington (2007) who shows that
Congressmen who have more daughters—conditional on number of total children—tend
to vote in a way that receives higher ratings from women’s issues PACs, such as the
National Organization for/of Women (NOW), and lower ratings from pro-life PACs, like
Right to Life. Her results hold for legislators from both parties—though, of course,
Democrats receive higher average scores. She interprets this result as a ‘socialization
effect’—that is, daughters, she argues, influence the thinking of their parents. However,
it is equally possible, we believe, that her finding results from a shift in the legislator’s
own interests. If a legislator does not have a daughter, then s/he may care less about
policies to better the lives and opportunities of women than someone who has a daughter,
ceritus parabus. Put more starkly, if a legislator does not have a teenage daughter who
may become pregnant, s/he may not be as personally impacted by, for example, abortion
restrictions.2
The good news is that, for our analysis, the reason(s) for the effect are not
important as long as they meet the exclusion restriction for our second stage. Namely,
2

In Washington’s data, the association between proportion daughters and NOW score is positive for both
male and female legislators. However, only for male legislators is the association statistically significant,
and the magnitude of the association is greater for men than for women. (See Washington 2007, Table 3)

12

there can be no indirect effect (i.e. not reflected in their voting record and rating of that
record by the PAC) of the sex mix of legislators’ offspring on the donations they receive
from a given PAC. This boils down to the assumption that PACs do not intentionally or
unintentionally give more donations to legislators with daughters, net of their evaluations
of those legislators. This seems like a reasonable assumption. If there were subtle bias in
PAC behavior thanks to the composition of the legislator’s family, we would likely see it
in the overall rating of that legislator, too, and not just in the donation amounts. This
assumption falls apart to the extent that ratings are made very unalterable algorithms and
donations are made by more flexible, ‘softer’ criteria. Even if this difference in PAC
decision making processes exists at these two decision points, it is still unlikely to reflect
bias induced by the sex mix of children to any significant degree
Another way that the exclusion restriction might be violated would be if the
presence of daughters makes the legislators more or less powerful in Congress in ways
that are independent of their actual votes. For example, conditional on how many
children a member of Congress has, the proportion of daughters may influence how well
liked s/he is in her/his home district; or partisanship3; or it may affect committee
assignment; or leadership roles; or tenure—all factors that have been shown to be
associated with donation levels. While it may be easy to come up with reasons why the
number of children a legislator has could affect their Congressional careers in any
number of ways, it is much more difficult to suggest that the proportion of daughters
3

In running descriptive statistics for legislators of both parties, we find that the proportion daughters differs
by political party, and the difference – in which Republicans have a lower proportion daughters – is
significant at the .05 level. The mean proportion daughters for Republicans is 0.49 and for Democrats is
0.53. A t-test for the difference in means suggests that we can reject the null hypothesis at the .05 level.
This may suggest that proportion daughters influences party affiliation (though it also may be a chance
finding given the number of observables we tested and the small, substantive magnitude of the difference);
nonetheless, we control for party ID in our analysis.

does. One possible problem is that having two same sex children among the first two
born has been shown to influence whether or not parents go on to have additional
children (Angrist and Evans 1998; Conley and Glauber 2006). However, our key
indicator is not “same sex” but rather proportion girls; furthermore, the fact that the
impact of each additional daughter appears linear and works for legislators with two
children or with three, the idea that the presence of two daughters is driving PAC score
through fertility should be allayed.

DATA AND METHODS:
We estimate the effect of voting behavior on contributions from Political Action
Committees using a two-stage least squares approach. As previous research finds that the
proportion daughters for federal legislators is a significant predictor of voting behavior
for women’s issues (Washington 2007), we limit our analysis to issues identified by
NARAL Pro-Choice America in the annual “Congressional Record on Choice.” NARAL
Pro-Choice America is one of the largest organizations advocating for a woman’s right to
choose. The organization lobbies on women’s issues, including birth control, abortion,
and sex education, and has contributed more than two million dollars to political
candidates in each of the three previous election cycles. The organization also rates
legislators, based on their voting patterns for an aggregate set of bills tracked by the
organization.
For the present project, we compiled an extensive dataset for members of the
United States House of Representatives from the 105th Congress (1997-1998) through the
108th Congress (2003-2004). Using a dataset originally compiled by Washington (2007)

14

Conley & McCabe

Just Desserts? Offspring Sex Mix and Political Donations

that included proportion daughters, age, and religion of each member of the House of
Representatives, we expanded the dataset to include PAC contributions from NARAL
Pro-Choice America for each election cycle from 1998 to 2006, as well as scores from
NARAL Pro-Choice America from 1997 through 2004.
In our sample of legislators, the mean representative is 55 years old and has 2.45
children. Of the 1,740 person-year observations in our dataset, four observations are
missing data on the number of children.4 Another 225 observations are legislators
without children, and these legislators are therefore excluded from our analysis. As a
result, we limit our analysis to the 1,511 observations in which legislators have children,
and we have accurate data about the sex mix of those children. Of this sample of
legislators with children, the mean proportion of daughters is 0.51.
In the first stage of each analysis (outlined below), we use scores assigned by
NARAL as the dependent variable. NARAL scores legislators on a scale of 0 – 100
based on a composite of votes each year, and these scores are published in NARAL’s
annual “Congressional Record on Choice.” A legislator receiving a score of 100 voted in
concurrence with the NARAL position on each of the Congressional votes for that year; a
legislator receiving a score of 0 voted the opposite of the position supported by NARAL
on each piece of legislation. The number of votes used in the annual composite varies by
year, with as few as two votes in 2004 to nineteen votes in 1997. In a typical year, the
Congressional Record on Choice includes votes on issues like the “Partial Birth”
Abortion Ban; an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization Act forbidding
military personnel from obtaining privately-funded abortions at overseas military

hospitals; an amendment to the Agricultural Appropriations banning the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) from testing drugs for early, non-surgical abortions; the denial of
U.S. family planning assistance abroad to non-governmental organizations that use
private funds to provide abortions; and an amendment to the Labor, Health and Human
Services Appropriations banning the prescription of emergency contraception pills at
school-based health centers.5 We transformed annual scores for legislators into a score
for each legislator in each Congress by averaging a legislator’s score across the two-year
period for that Congress. For example, if a legislator received a score of 80 for the year
1997 and 90 for the year 1998, we averaged that legislator’s score to give him/her a
NARAL score of 85 for the 105th Congress. In Table 6, we provide the frequency of
scores for legislators in each Congress. As the table suggests, the majority of legislators
scored either a 0 or 100 in each Congress, although there is significant variation across
the range of scores.

<< Insert Table 6 here >>

The mean NARAL score varied significantly by political party, with the average
Democrat receiving a NARAL score of 76, while the average Republican received a
NARAL score of 11.
Information on political contributions from NARAL Pro-Choice America was
compiled from the website www.opensecrets.org, and includes observations for each
person-year. In the four election cycles considered in this paper (and, thus, 1,740 personyears), 1,457 observations – or approximately 84% – received no money from NARAL

Pro-Choice America. Table 7 illustrates the frequency distribution, by $1,000
contributions.

<< Insert Table 7 here >>

The maximum donation recorded was $10,000, and it appears in thirteen cases in our
data. The mean contribution per person-year is $396.87, although this varies by political
party, as well. The average Democrat received $765.48 from NARAL, whereas the mean
Republican received $59.10. In fact, only seven Republican received donations from
NARAL Pro-Choice America during the time period covered, accounting for 13 unique
observations in our dataset.6 Of the observations for Democrats in our dataset, there are
270 cases – or 32.45% of observations for Democrats – in which members received
contributions from NARAL.
We begin by using a “naïve” ordinary least squares analysis to predict whether a
legislator was the recipient of donations from NARAL Pro-Choice America. In this
model (and all subsequent ones), we have accounted for the fact that a legislator’s score
is likely to affect political contributions in the subsequent election cycle by lagging our
measure of PAC contributions. We match donations in an election cycle with the score
received by a legislator during the preceding Congress. For example, we predict PAC
donations in the 1998 election cycle using a legislator’s NARAL Pro-Choice America
score for the years 1997-1998 (105th Congress). The temporal ordering of this

Simmons (R-CT) – 2; Steve Israel (R-NY) – 1.

estimation technique logically suggests that voting behavior in the 105th Congress has an
effect on the political contributions received in the campaign for the subsequent (106th)
Congress. However, the naïve regression assumes that a legislator’s score is independent
of the likelihood of receiving a contribution from NARAL Pro-Choice America, and is
therefore treated as an exogenous independent variable in the regression analysis.
Although the theoretical literature gives us ample reason to dismiss this assumption, the
naïve model enables comparison with the instrumented model. In this linear probability
model, we control for individual legislator characteristics, including party affiliation, age
and religious affiliation. This model is shown as equation one, below.7
(1)

Y = α + β 1 AGE + β 2 DEMOCRAT + β 3CHRISTIAN + β 4 CATHOLIC
+ β 5 PROTESTANT + β 6 NARALSCORE + ε

where Y is a dichotomous variable indicating whether or not a legislator received money
from NARAL; AGE is the legislator’s age; DEMOCRAT is a dummy variable for party
affiliation; CHRISTIAN, CATHOLIC, and PROTESTANT are three dummy variables
for religion (with a fourth dummy variable, OTHERRELIGION, excluded as the
reference category); and NARALSCORE is the legislator’s NARAL score as observed.
We then compare this approach to results from a 2SLS approach. The first stage
predicts NARAL score using the same set of controls, along with a variable,
PROPDAUGHT (proportion daughters of total children)
(2)

NARALSCORE = α + β1 AGE + β 2 DEMOCRAT + β 3CHRISTIAN + β 4 CATHOLIC
+ β 5 PROTESTANT + β 6 PROPDAUGHT + ε

7

A logistic regression model yields similar estimates. We prefer the LPM since Heckman and Macurdy
(1985) and others have persuasively argued that in an IV- or 2SLS-regression with a dichotomous Y, a
linear probability estimation is most consistent.

Our second stage regression (LPM) estimates the impact of this instrumented
NARALSCORE* on the likelihood of receiving a donation from NARAL for each
legislator in the subsequent election cycle. This second stage is shown in Equation 3,
below:
(3)

Y = α + β1 AGE + β 2 DEMOCRAT + β 3CHRISTIAN + β 4 CATHOLIC
+ β 5 PROTESTANT + β 6 NARALSCORE * + ε

After presenting the main results, we then refer the reader to an appendix, which contains
additional analysis, including an IV-regressions broken down by various demographic
and political variables in our sample, including sex, region, political party and age in an
effort to determine whether there are heterogeneous treatment effects.

RESULTS:
As a baseline for comparison, first we estimate an Ordinary Least Squares model
of the likelihood of NARAL donation in a given election cycle based on NARAL score
for the previous Congress—using only time ordering as a claim on exogeneity. We
present the results of our naïve regression in column A of Table 8, below. While we
dismiss these results out of hand because of concerns about endogeneity previous
discussed, the presentation of the naïve results allow researchers to compare the two stage
least squares estimation with the ordinary least squares regression to see how the latter
may misrepresent the magnitude of the effect of a legislator’s NARAL score on the
probability of receiving a PAC donation.

Column B of Table 8 shows the first stage of our instrumental variable approach.
In the first stage of our estimation, we find that proportion daughters has a significant and
positive effect on a legislator’s NARAL Pro-Choice America score, net of a legislator’s
age, religion, and political affiliation. As Column B of Table 8 reports, the positive
association between proportion of daughters and legislator’s NARAL score is significant
at the .001 level, and has an association of nearly 10 points. These results are consistent
with the hypothesis that the proportion of daughters has an effect on voting behavior, net
of other individual characteristics. More precisely, an increase in the proportion of
daughters makes a legislator more likely to support legislation important to NARAL ProChoice America such that going from no daughters and all sons to all daughters and no
sons would raise a legislator’s NARAL score by 10 points.
In column C of Table 8, above, we show the second stage results in which we use
a linear probability model and the instrumented value of NARAL score (from the first
stage shown in Column B) to predict the likelihood that a legislator received
contributions from NARAL Pro-Choice America. As shown in Column C, we find that
our instrument for NARAL score is highly significant, and, in fact, the parameter
estimate is larger than the naïve OLS estimate, though a test shows that they are not
significantly different from each other.8

To extend our analysis, we also estimated a second stage modeling the effect of a legislator’s
instrumented score on the amount received, conditional on receiving any contribution from NARAL.
(Table not shown; available from authors upon request.) We find that, conditional on having received
money from NARAL, the relationship between NARAL score and PAC contributions is not significant.
However, we suspect that the small sample size resulting from sub-setting our data is driving the nonsignificant results. Given the problematic nature of the small sample size (n=231), we also ran a two-stage
least squares estimate of the effect of NARAL scores on amount of NARAL contributions for the entire
population of legislators (i.e. including zero values, n=1511). When we include the entire population,
rather than a subset of the population, we find that a legislator’s NARAL score does, in fact, have an effect
on his/her PAC donations. A one-point increase in a legislators NARAL score is associated with an
increase of $20 in PAC contributions from NARAL. However, this model is of limited additional value to

DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS:
The relationship between voting behavior and political contributions remains a
central puzzle in the American political system. Research attempting to disentangle the
effects of money in the political process has pointed the causal arrow from contributions
to behavior, asking whether contributions from political action committees affects the
voting patterns of legislators. While this literature is inconclusive, much of the evidence
suggests that the high correlation between voting behavior and campaign contributions
does not result from an attempt by PACs to ‘buy’ votes.
In this paper, we explore an alternative perspective on money and politics.
Flipping the causal arrow, we ask whether voting behavior determines political
contributions and, if so, what is the strength of that relationship. The evidence presented
in this paper lends credibility to the hypothesis that a legislator’s voting behavior affects
contributions received from political action committees in subsequent election cycles.
Using exogenous variation in the sex mix of a legislator’s children, we employ a two
stage least squares estimation procedure to measure the impact of voting behavior on
political donations. We find that the proportion daughters has a significant effect on a
legislator’s voting behavior with regard to women’s issues, as measured by NARAL ProChoice America scores compiled in their “Congressional Record of Choice.” In the
second stage of our analysis, we find a positive association between NARAL score and
the likelihood of a NARAL PAC contribution, suggesting that voting behavior largely
determines political contributions. When we compare this estimate using exogenous
our linear probability estimation of likelihood of receipt of any contribution since the data are so negatively
skewed, with nearly 85% of observations having not received any NARAL contribution.

variration in voting patterns to the “naïve” estimate that merely deploys observed voting
score in a OLS linear probability model, we find that the two parameter estimates are not
significantly different, suggesting that the observed relationship is one of rewards and not
bribery—at least for this PAC on this issue. A comparison of the results from the two
models is shown in Figure 4, below

<<Figure 4 about Here>>
While our evidence moves away from a ‘vote buying’ hypothesis towards a
system of ‘rewards’, we are careful in extrapolating our results beyond the particular
policy domain identified in this analysis. Reproductive rights represent a unique,
ideologically-charged policy domain, and the ex ante commitment of legislators to
particular political positions is, we suspect, quite strong. The ‘rewards’ system identified
here might be particularly strong for ideologically charged issues where the possibility of
position shifting from ‘vote buying’ is improbable. In low-visibility, low-impact issues,
the possibility of a ‘vote buying’ system may be more plausible, and could be empirically
tested through a similar estimation procedure. We encourage researchers to take
advantage of the methodologies introduced here to test whether the ‘rewards’ system
holds for less ideological issues—if, of course, suitable instrument for such voting
patterns can be found.
On the other hand, it is possible that the unusually high-visibility of reproductiverelated issues might force choice-related PACs to be more conservative in dolling out
rewards, given the increased scrutiny they endure. Regardless of the direction of the
causal arrow, if public perception of high visibility issues suggests that Political Action

22

Conley & McCabe

Committees are using money to ‘buy votes,’ then Political Action Committees might
respond to this increased public scrutiny by tempering their contributions. In this
scenario, PACs advocating for ideological, high-visibility issues may be rewarding
legislators less than those engaged in low-visibility issues. Not needing to respond to
public scrutiny, low-visibility PACs may, in fact, be the most engaged in this system of
rewards.
Our analysis is not intended to suggest that Political Action Committees do not
influence the behavior of legislators. There are, of course, other ways in which Political
Action Committees sway individual legislators’ voting behavior. They may apply
pressure in committees, or use their prowess to affect the content of legislation. Our
analysis speaks only to the direct impact of political contributions from Political Action
Committees to legislators, not to a host of alternative mechanisms through which
Political Action Committees exercise their political clout. Instead, it attempts to unravel
the age-old political question about the relationship between political contributions and
voting behavior. The analysis is similarly limited in disentangling the relationship
between voting behavior and other sources of political contributions, like individual
donors, labor unions, or corporations. Political Action Committees are unique insofar as
they attempt to influence policy on a particular, well-defined subset of political issues
(e.g., women’s issues). The relationship between individual contributions, corporate
contributions or those made by labor unions may be more difficult to disentangle, as the
measurable outcomes are not as straightforward as those presented in this analysis.
Nonetheless, future analysis should look towards exploring the important relationship
between voting behavior and individual donors, corporate contributions and labor unions.

23

Despite these limitation, the current paper offers some comfort to careful political
observers that ours may not be, after all, a system of bribery—at least for issues of major
public concern. Instead, it’s just desserts.

APPENDIX
While the pooled data provides evidence of the exogenous impact of voting
behavior on political contributions, we further disaggregate the data by examining
particular sub-samples of our population. In Table A1, we run similar models by various
demographic groups, attempting to determine whether the relationship between scores
and money vary by subgroup. These results suggest that the relationship between money
and scores, as outlined above, is particular strong for Democrats and legislators older
than 55 years old, the mean age in our dataset. A one-point increase in a legislator’s
instrumented score is associated with a 1.3% increase in the likelihood of receiving
contributions for legislators over 55 years old. Likewise, we find that an increase in
instrumented NARAL score is associated with approximately a one-percentage point
increase in the likelihood of receiving donations for both Democratic legislators and nonSouthern legislators.
