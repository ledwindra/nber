The Surprising Instability of Export Specializations

NBER Working Paper No. 22869
November 2016
JEL No. F1,F14,F63,O1,O24
ABSTRACT
We study the instability of hyper-specialization of exports. We have two main findings. (1)
Specializations are surprisingly unstable: Export ranks are not persistent, and new top products
and destinations replace old ones. Measurement error is unlikely to be the main or only
determinant of this pattern. (2) Source-country factors are not the main explanation of this
instability: Only 20% of the variation in export growth can be explained by variation in
comparative advantage (source-by-product factors), while another 20% of the variation in export
growth can be explained by variation in bilateral (source-by-destination) factors. The high share
of product, destination, and product-by-destination factors, diminishes the emphasis on the
nations where the exports originate. The high share of idiosyncratic variance (residual at the
source-product-destination level of variation) of about 30%, also indicates the difficulty to predict
export success using source country characteristics. These findings suggest that export
performance depends, to a greater extent than previously appreciated, on forces that are outside
the realm of national export promotion and industrial policies.

I. Introduction

What are the roads to economic development? Part of the answer lies in success in
international trade (Frankel and Romer 1999). 1 Informed observation of the Asian Tigers
and China’s recent experience demonstrates this effect. Whatever the sources of
comparative advantage may be – technology (Ricardo), endowments (Heckscher and
Ohlin), geography (Frankel and Romer 1999, structural gravity equations), the interaction
between geography and technology (Eaton and Kortum 2002) or institutions (Nunn 2007,
Levchenko 2007) – high income is tightly correlated with success in exporting and
reaping the gains from trade. 2 Figure 1 is suggestive of this for a cross section of 96
countries: The correlation between success in exporting and success measured by income
per capita is 0.92.
In this paper we study the instability of export flows over time, and we pay special
attention to top export flows. Hyper-specialization in exports has been previously
documented, as we discuss below. Our main contribution, however, is to document the
instability of top exports. This is important because top exports account for most of the
value of exports and, as we demonstrate below, it is the top exports that are correlated
with development. Yet it is surprising how unpredictable which good and which
destination make up the top exports.
We analyze instability in a number of non-parametric ways. First, graphically, we
illustrate how the ranking of export goods changes over time, from 1998 to 2010, for a set
of countries of different levels of development. These detailed charts make clear what
kind of products are involved in both hyper-specialization and just how unstable these

1

Siscart and Noguer (2005) corroborate the findings of Frankel and Romer (1999) with improved methodology and
data.
2 Easterly and Reshef (2016) document other sources of export success in Africa, such as moving up the quality ladder,
trade liberalization, foreign ownership, ethnic networks, and personal foreign experience of the exporting entrepreneur, as
well as idiosyncratic factors like entrepreneurial persistence, luck, and cost shocks. Some of the successes occur in areas
that usually fail. See also Artopolus, Friel and Hallak (2010) for examples from Argentina.

2

hyper-specializations are. Our analysis uses 4-digit HS codes to identify products (there
are 1225 such codes). This level of aggregation is enough to eliminate much of the
idiosyncratic variation (such as measurement error due to misclassification) without
sacrificing a clear notion of differentiation in the product space.
More systematically, we show that correlations between export ranks in 1998 and 2010
are surprisingly low, on the order of only 0.3. We analyze the probability of remaining a
top export in 2010 conditional on being a top export in 1998, and find that this increases
with the level of development, which implies that exports from developing countries tend
to be more unstable. This is true whether we study trade flows at the product or at the
product-by-destination level (which we will call export “flows”). We illustrate that export
instability is not driven primarily by measurement error.
Finally, we analyze the sources of export instability. We develop a methodology to
decompose the sources of variation in export growth along several dimensions, as well as
their interactions (e.g., the source-by-product interaction, which captures variation in
comparative advantage). While analysis and public policy discussion often attribute
changes in export performance to the source country, we consider the role of other factors
beyond the source country – trends in global demand, global trade trends by product,
effects of demand in the destination country (both in general and for specific products in
that destination), and effects specific to the source-destination combination (such as the
changing importance of distance, the bilateral manifestation of trade agreements, and
other bilateral “gravity” forces).
Our results indicate that changes in comparative advantage alone (source-by-product)
account for only 20% of the variation in export growth. Another 20% of the variation is
accounted for by bilateral factors. This suggests that explanations for export success that
focus only on comparative advantage in the source country (and the policies that affect
gains from comparative advantage) may be missing much of the origins of success.

3

It is also notable that the sum of product and destination effects on variation in export
growth are slightly larger than the sum of effects involving the source country (sourceby-product effects plus source-by-destination effects, even with the latter not being
completely driven by the source country). Overall, the results suggest that most of the
variability in export growth is not driven by source country factors. This suggests that too
much export success or failure may be attributed to the source countries, as opposed to
external and global factors. While local entrepreneurs and firms may be active in locating
and reaping these external opportunities, our analysis indicates that these opportunities
are not driven by source-country forces per se. In line with this, about one-third of export
growth of top products and half of export growth for all products can only be attributed to
completely idiosyncratic shocks. 3
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II presents some facts about the
relationship between exports and income, and discusses our contribution to the existing
literature. Section III describes our data. Section IV presents our results about export
concentration and instability. Section V analyzes the sources of instability. Section VI
concludes.

II. Stylized Facts and Previous Literature

Figure 1 showed the high correlation between success in exporting and income. 4 Figure 2
shows that this relationship can be summarized by observing only the top 20 (4-digit HS
codes) exported products, with a correlation that is almost as high, at 0.90. This motivates
a more forensic examination of the most important part of export flows, at the upper tail
3

We also find that variation in export growth in richer economies and in countries that have more diversified exports
across destinations is driven even less by variation in comparative advantage and bilateral ties.
4
In an Eaton and Kortum (2002) model, both export success and income are driven by the level of technology. A
country with better technology, i.e. absolute advantage, will have higher income, partially because it can supply its goods
more cheaply to other destinations. This model is static and says nothing about instability.

of the export size distribution. Figure 3 shows that this relationship holds with a very high
correlation of 0.85, even when we consider the top 20 exports flows, where a flow is
defined as a particular 4-digit product shipped to a particular destination country. The
signature feature of figures 1-3 is how similar they are. This resemblance demonstrates an
under-appreciated dimension of hyper-specialization: most products are shipped to very
few destinations, and the modal number of destinations per good exported is 1. 5
Export success is concentrated on relatively few goods and, consequently, success in
exporting is driven by a few big hits. Table 1 demonstrates that the top 20 goods that a
country exports (out of a maximum of 1225 4-digit HS codes) account for almost 70% of
total exports. This pattern is not just driven by commodities and extractables exports that
are more prevalent in low income countries such as African ones. African and other nonOECD countries are of particular interest because in our sample they see faster export
growth, as demonstrated in Figure 4.

5

The correlation between log total exports and the exports of top 20 goods is 0.99, and between log total exports and
the exports of top 20 flows (good by destination) is 0.85.

Our novel results on the instability of top export products have important implications
for industrial policy and trade protection. The erratic evolution of exports over time
questions the efficacy of protection policies that aim to promote exports by protecting or
subsidizing the industrial base. For example, Hausmann and Rodrik (2006) argue that
development occurs through a process of discovery of what a country is good at
producing. Since this process involves positive information externalities that are not
internalized by private actors, Hausmann and Rodrik (2006) advocate a subsidy for
discovery. This is in line with how Cadot, Disdier, Jaud and Suwa-Eisenmann (2014)
interpret their findings on export big hits, where they find little “crowding out” of firms
that follow a pioneer exporting firm. However, if external demand (not technology)

8

shocks are an important source of volatility of exports, then maybe it is less important –
or even impossible – to target specific industries. Hausmann, Hwang and Rodrik (2007)
argue that a country’s development converges to the level of countries that export similar
goods. This is capturing a long-standing concern in development that some countries are
trapped by their own characteristics into export patterns harmful to development, such as
the 1949 Prebisch-Singer hypothesis that poor countries are stuck with producing and
exporting commodities that are subject to declining terms of trade.6 However, if
specialization across both destinations and products is so unstable, then perhaps what a
country exports the most is not entirely an exporter-specific factor that dooms the country
to a sub-optimal outcome, nor does it seem that countries are trapped in any one suboptimal specialization.

See Harvey et al. (2010) and Arezki et al. (2013), who find mixed historical evidence on the validity of the PrebischSinger Hypothesis.

for a subgroup of countries. Source: COMTRADE.

The concentration of exports has been noticed by other scholars. Eaton, Eslava, Kugler,
and Tybout (2007) find that Colombian exports are driven by a small number of very
large (and stable) exporting firms. Bernard, Jensen, Redding, and Schott (2007)
document high concentration across U.S. exporting firms. Freund and Pierola (2015)
show that this phenomenon is general, and can be found among 32 countries of varying
levels of development. Panagariya and Bagaria (2013) show that concentration of exports
and imports across products is strikingly similar, which is surprising because we expect
comparative advantage to lead to much less concentration on the import side. Relative to
these papers, we add the destination dimension of concentration, we study how
concentration varies with income and overall export performance, and then we arrive at
our main finding of the instability of the specializations.

10

Cadot, Carrere and Strauss-Kahn (2011) estimate that concentration evolves as a UShape with economic development, being high at initial stages of development, low in
the interim, and high concentration again for rich countries. 7 Cadot et al. measure
concentration using a Theil index, which is strongly influenced by differences between
the largest values versus smaller values.8 In contrast, we examine export shares, which is
arguably a more transparent and natural measure of concentration. We focus on the
export shares of top exported goods or flows, which is the most important part of the
distribution. In line with Cadot et al., we find that concentration is highest in the least
developed countries, but we do not find strong evidence in favor of a reversal in the
reduction in concentration after some level of development.
The novel part of our work is documenting and then analyzing the instability of
exports. One source of exports volatility are demand shocks. Indeed, Eaton, Kortum and
Kramarz (2011) estimate that demand is important for understanding the distribution of
exports across firms in France, but they do not address volatility of demand (their model
is designed for a cross section of export flows, and their estimation reflects this). Another
potential source of volatility is technology. Trade models typically capture technological
dispersion either as a power law (e.g., Baldwin, 2005, Helpman, Melitz and Rubinstein,
2008) or a Frechet distribution (Eaton and Kortum, 2002). Both of these distributions
feature so-called “fat” tails. For theoretical tractability, in this class of models the
distribution of exports (and of production) is allowed to vary only by location in the
Frechet case, or is invariant in the power law case. 9 Both shape and concentration of the
distribution of exports seem to matter theoretically for aggregate fluctuations in
“granular” economies with fat tails (e.g. Gabaix, 2011, di Giovanni and Levchenko,

7

This result is reminiscent of Imbs and Wacziarg (2003), who document a similar pattern for industrial production, not
just exporting.
8
Depending on the same underlying distribution, Theil and mean log difference can show different trends over time.
9
Helpman, Melitz and Yeaple (2004) model different variances of economic activity through differences in the Pareto
slope coefficient. This helps them explain the tradeoff between serving foreign markets via exporting versus foreign direct
investment. We also exploit the relationship between the size of the Pareto slope coefficient and variance below.

11

2012, and di Giovanni, Levchenko and Mejan, 2014). We take an unrestricted,
nonparametric approach to describing concentration and volatility of exports.
In another strand of related work, Besedes and Prusa (2006a) find that most trade
relationships where the U.S. is an importer are short lived: Once started, they exhibit
“negative duration”, and African trade relationships with the U.S. are even shorter lived.
This could give rise to volatility, due to entry and then exit. Besedes and Prusa (2006b)
find that homogenous goods have much higher hazard rates, which can help explain the
difference in relationship duration for Africa. Cadot, Iacovone, Pierola and Rauch (2011)
show that new export relationships from African countries (data from Malawi, Mali,
Senegal, Tanzania) are more likely to last longer if there are other firms already exporting
the same product, or to the same destination. However, these papers are about new export
relationships, and only into the U.S. In contrast, we examine a broad set of countries, and
do so over longer periods. Moreover, we focus on instability at the very top of the export
distribution, which is where instability matters the most.
The most closely related paper to our work is Hanson, Lind and Muendler (2015).
They use a gravity model to estimate source-country variation across industries, and find
that the growth process underlying this variation over time exhibits mean-reversion and is
consistent with a stationary distribution. Levchenko and Zhang (2011) compute industrylevel productivities in manufacturing and also estimate mean-reversion in industry
productivities. Neither Hanson et al. (2015) nor Levchenko and Zhang (2011) address
other sources of exporting variability. Another closely related paper is Gaubert and
Itskhoki (2016), who study firm-level granular origins of comparative advantage. While
the dynamic version of their model can mimic changes in industries’ comparative
advantage, they do not address the sources of firms’ large productivity or demand shocks.
In contrast, our analysis of the sources of export growth variability includes all possible
dimensions, including product-specific, as well as destinations. This is important: One of
our main findings is that source-by-product (or industry) variation – the focus of

12

Levchenko and Zhang (2011), Hanson et al. (2015) and Gaubert and Itskhoki (2016) – is
not a large source of instability in exports over time. Destination-related (demand) factors
matter more. 10

III. Data Description

We obtain data on goods exported by over 100 countries from the United Nation’s
COMTRADE database. 11 We use 4-digit (HS code) aggregation as a compromise
between our interest in using well-defined categories of goods and the risk of
measurement error, which increases due to the possibility of mis-classification as we
disaggregate more. For each of these goods we have information on bilateral exports by
year. Figure 5 shows that the sample of countries included each year is not constant. The
sample increases constantly until the early 2000s and starts decreasing abruptly after
2010. Importantly, the selection of countries is not random as less developed countries
are less likely to be present both in early and late years. Given these concerns, we focus
our analysis on the years 1998 to 2010. Given our focus on medium-run trade growth,
most of the analysis is performed using just the beginning and end points 1998 and 2010.
We carry out robustness checks to test that our analysis is not biased by this selection.

10

Another difference between our work and Hanson et al. (2015) is that they use different industry classification, and
in their main results they use only 133 industries, whereas our analysis utilizes about 1200 industries. This in itself can lead
to different inferences.
11
The data is publicly available at http://comtrade.un.org/db/default.aspx.

13

Figure 5: Number of countries sampled in COMTRADE per year, total and by continent.

Keeping only countries which have trade data on both 1998 and 2010 leaves a sample
of 127 countries. We combine the trade data with information on real PPP GDP per
capita from the Total Economy Database (TED) and transform all prices to constant 2012
US dollars using the CPI index from FRED. 12 For some of our analysis we define two
additional categories of goods – extractables and commodities – because of the (partly
correct) belief that the poorest countries export mainly in these two categories. For this
we use the reference suggested by the UN on the description of each the commodity list.
The lists of goods included in each category are available in the appendix. For some of

12

For CPI we use the CPIAUCSL series from FRED, https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/, provided by the Federal
Reserve Bank of Saint Louis. When using data on GDP per capita our sample is further reduced to 112 countries because
TED does not report this information for 15 of the countries for which we have trade data.

our analysis we classify countries according to their continents and their development
level based on the list by the International Statistical Institute (ISI) and OECD. 13

IV. Facts about Export Concentration and Instability

In this section we show evidence on the degree of concentration in exports and, more
importantly, the high instability within top exports. Section V will turn to characterizing
the sources of this instability.

A. Concentration of Exports
In this section we show that the degree of concentration of exports is surprising for all
countries. Table 1 shows that, on average, the single largest export category accounts for
25% of total exports. The top 20 exports account for almost 70% of total exports, and this
figure is still extremely high even after excluding commodities and extractable goods. 14

13

The list of developing countries is obtained from the ISI at http://www.isi-web.org/component/content/article/5root/root/81-developing. The list of OECD members is obtained from http://www.oecd.org/about/membersandpartners/.
14
Table A1 in the appendix illustrates that African countries have more concentrated exports than OECD countries, on
average. This relationship holds more generally: Higher income (GDP per capita in PPP units) is associated with lower
shares of top 20 exported goods.

Table 1: Export concentration among top 20 goods and flows, distribution within top 20
goods and flows, and power law coefficients. The table reports the average share of top
20 goods and flows (good-by-destination) for all countries in our sample at the 4-digit
HS code level. Rankings are defined according to values in 2010. The power law
coefficient is given by the regression of the log rank on the log export share. A lower
coefficient in absolute value implies higher concentration. Source: COMTRADE.
The pattern of concentration within the top 20 exported goods can be captured by
fitting a line to log ranks (vertical axis) and log export shares (horizontal axis). Such
“power laws” are remarkably successful in describing concentration at the tails of the
distribution of many economic (and other) phenomena (for example, see Newman 2005
and Gabaix 2016). This is true in our data as well. The last line in Table 1 reports the
point estimate of the log rank regressed on log share across countries and groups of
products. A smaller coefficient in absolute value implies higher concentration. These
small coefficients, below unity in absolute value, indicate extremely high levels of

16

concentration, that are only slightly larger in absolute value when excluding commodities
and extractables. 15
We carry out the same analysis for what we call a “flow”, defined as a particular
product shipped to a particular destination, with very similar results. We illustrate this in
the second set of columns in Table 1. Some differences are noticeable between the results
that take into account the destination dimension and those that do not. First, the overall
share of top 20 flows is smaller than for goods, which is to be expected. Second,
concentration, as measured by the power law coefficient, is only slightly lower. These
results are hardly affected when we exclude commodities and extractables. 16
Table 2 correlates power law coefficients, which capture concentration at the top, with
a few covariates of interest. 17 The relationship between income and concentration within
exports is systematic: Higher GDP per capita makes the power law coefficient more
negative (i.e. increases it in absolute value), which implies lower concentration. When we
include a GDP squared term (not reported), it is marginally significant at the 10 percent
level. The implied turning point for log (GDPPC) is about 10, which is at the upper end
of our sample range. Hence the negative relationship between GDP and the power law
coefficient holds for most of our sample range. The squared term is not precisely
estimated for the regressions using flows, which corroborates our conclusion that overall
concentration is higher for less developed countries.
Power law coefficients also have a strong inverse relationship with the scale of total
exports. The largest exporters are less concentrated at the top. Another important
dimension is the total number of nonzero goods export categories (at the HS4 level) by
15

Power law coefficients less than one in absolute value (such as those in Africa) have the bizarre property that the
mean of the underlying distribution is infinite. However, we are not claiming that the entire distribution fits a power law,
only the tail of the top 20 categories.
16
Table A2 in the appendix illustrates that the reduction in concentration when excluding commodities and extratables
is much smaller for African countries versus OECD members. This illustrates another dimension of concentration: African
exports are more concentrated across destinations within exported goods than OECD exports.
17
Helpman, Melitz and Yeaple (2004) also use power coefficients to capture concentration.

exporter. This is the strongest predictor of power law variation: The steepest power laws
are in countries that have many nonzero entries for different goods, implying that these
exporters are less concentrated. When we examine concentration within top export flows
(good-by-destination), the results are broadly similar to those for goods, but somewhat
stronger.

summarizing concentration for the entire distribution. First, we calculate the Herfindahl
index across destinations for each product exported from each country (higher index
implies higher concentration). We then calculate the (trade value) weighted average of
this index for each exporting country and year.
Figure 6 groups countries by their development stage. OECD countries are more
diversified over destinations than African or other developing countries. 18 Differences in

This is mainly driven by European countries’ higher diversification. Figures that separate European countries from
the rest are available upon request.

concentration are very persistent: We do not observe strong trends in this measure of
concentration, despite significant changes in income for most countries during this
period. The jump in the early 1990s for Africa and other developing countries is due to
changes in the sample, not within-country variation.

Figure 6: Weighted average of Herfindahl index over destinations for exports at the 4digit HS code level, where weights are volumes in 1998. The figure reports the average
index for all countries’ trading partners in each region. Source: COMTRADE.
When we regress our measure of concertation across destinations on log GDP per
capita, we get a negative and highly statistically significant coefficient: Richer countries
are more diversified. Similarly, when we regress concertation across destinations on log
total exports, we get a negative and highly statistically significant coefficient: Countries
that export more do so in a more diversified fashion. Finally, we find that European

19

economies have more diversified exports across destinations relative to other
economies. 19
In summary, all countries have surprisingly extreme power laws in top export products
and top flows, but there is also variation among them. The steepest (most negative) slopes
and least concentration are for countries that are in these (overlapping) categories: Higher
income, higher total exports, and higher number of different goods exported. The
destination specialization is also confirmed by surprisingly high Herfindahls by
destination for the typical export product, although again the concentration is less for
countries with higher income, more overall exports, and for European economies.

B. Instability of Top Exports
Our most interesting and novel finding is the instability of exports. In Figure 7 we
illustrate this phenomenon for four countries: Tanzania, Ghana, Germany and The United
States.

20

For each country we rank the top 10 exported products (4-digit HS code) in

1998 and in 2010. Then, we show how the ranking of each top 10 export good changes
from 1998 to 2010, and, vice versa, what the rank of each top 10 export good in 2010 was
in 1998. Figure 7 illustrates the great extent of churning of ranks in export data; it also
demonstrates that instability is pervasive, both in developed and developing countries. 21
We address a concern that we could be exaggerating instability; perhaps there is just a
lot of measurement error, such as misclassification of products over time. Figure 7
provides some reassurance that misclassification is not the primary factor in the results on
instability. The replacement of former top goods by new ones generally features very
different goods – they are generally not in adjacent categories that are likely to be subject

In the appendix we report additional figures for Uganda and Japan.
We do not report similar figures for top 20 products to ease the exposition, but these convey the same message.

20

to reclassification from one to another. We address other types of measurement error
below.
For example, in Tanzania (Figure 7-A), the top 3 exports in 1998 were nuts, coffee, and
fish; these 3 shifted down to be #6, #7, and #8 in 2010. Conversely, copper, manganese,
and precious metal ore were virtually nonexistent exports in 1998, but by 2010 occupied
the second through fourth ranks in Tanzanian exports. The new #2 export, manganese, is
a good example of concentration of destinations, as Tanzania’s supplies went in 2010
only to China (65%), Japan (23%), and Germany (12%). It is also an example of a strong
product effect, as total trade in manganese vastly expanded from only $308 million in
1998 to $4.2 billion in 2010.
In Ghana (Figure 7-B), the #1 and #2 exports in 1998, cocoa and gold, switched places,
with a huge increase for gold. Aluminum plates in Ghana went from #18 in 1998 to #3 in
2010. Manganese had the same kind of increase in Ghana as it did in Tanzania, going
from $17 million to $119 million from 1998 to 2010, but Ghana’s top destination for this
product was Ukraine instead of China.
Although we will show that there is somewhat less instability for higher income
countries relative to poorer ones, it is still surprisingly high. In Germany (Figure 7-C),
there is more stability in the top 4, but #5 (computers) declined to #9 in 2010, #6
(integrated circuits) went to #16, and #7 (motor vehicles for goods transport) declined to
#21. Those export ranks were replaced by “blood, antisera, vaccines, toxins and cultures”
(#91 to #5), and printing machinery (#12 to #6).
The United States (Figure 7-D) illustrates even more instability than Germany. Aircraft
was the top export in 1998 but fell to a rank of #143 in 2010, while the related category
of aircraft parts fell from #7 to #40. “Petroleum, bituminous, distillates, not including
crude” rose from #26 in 1998 to #1 in 2010. Parts for office machines went from #5 to
#15, while “Medicaments, therapeutic, prophylactic use, in dosage” fell from #26 to #7.

21

Goods that show a fall in more than one country (such as computers or integrated
circuits, all falling in the US, Germany and Japan) or a rise (printing machinery in
Germany and Japan) could be reflecting worldwide product trends, a possibility that our
analysis below will allow us to address.

Another way to show the instability of exports is to show the drastic changes in value
over time. When ranks change, this is accompanied with huge swings in value. A log
base 10 scale is necessary to capture these changes. Here a one-unit increase signifies an
increase of 10 times; two units imply a change of 100 times. We do this for Ecuador in
Figure 8-A and for Kenya in Figure 8-B.

Figure 8-A: Ecuador top export revenues by good, log base 10 scale, 1998 and 2010.
Source: COMTRADE.
Ecuador (Figure 8-A) shows an increase of a factor of 2.8 in cut flowers, while coffee
export revenues fell by 40%, which scrambled the ranks of top exports. In contrast, cocoa
beans exhibited a 14 times increase in exports. Vehicles and parts thereof were not
exported at all in 1998, but in 2010 they accounted for 155.4 million U.S. dollars (in 2012
prices). Even if this is partly related to the increase in exports of motor cars designed for
the transport of persons – which increased by a factor of 2.2 – adding the two together

27

indicates a large fourfold increase in the value of exports. Kenya in Figure 8-B shows the
fall of a traditional export and the rise of some non-traditional ones. Coffee revenue
declined 27 percent, while export revenue from cut flowers and fresh vegetables
increased by a factor of 3.4. Exports of cement, another non-traditional export, increased
almost threefold.

Cut flowers exports are a good example of the international dimensions of export
performance. Table 3 shows the change in export revenue from cut flowers from 1998 to
2010 by source and destination (many smaller sources and destinations are omitted from
the table to ease the exposition, but row and column totals include omitted countries).

Table 3: Change in value of Cut Flowers Exports, millions of $US. Source: COMTRADE.
Cut flowers trade as a whole grew by more than $2 billion from 1998 to 2010. The big
winners are Colombia, Ecuador, and Kenya. Colombia and Ecuador presumably
benefited from their closeness to the biggest growth market, the USA. They also
managed to crowd out other nearby exporters like Mexico and Guatemala. Kenya did
well by capturing more of the European market, which obviously reflects geographic
distance again (although neighboring sources like Tanzania and Uganda failed to benefit).
Malaysia, Korea, China, and Thailand in turn benefited from closeness to the Japanese
growth market. The biggest losers were Australia and New Zealand for the Japanese
market, and Italy, Israel, Morocco, and Spain for the European market. Italy and Morocco
may have suffered in particular from the contraction of their previously large German
market. There are some cross-overs between geographic markets, such as the surprising
flow from Ecuador to Russia. This example shows the possibilities for source,

29

destination, and product to interact in ways that we will explore formally in the last
section – reinforcing the point that not everything in export performance is about source
country characteristics or policies.
In Table 4 we draw a more systematic portrait of instability. For each country in our
sample we rank the top exported goods (4-digit HS code) both in 1998 and 2010. We
then keep only those goods that were among the top (for alternative cutoffs, i.e. top 10,
top 20, top 50 and top 100) in 1998. If a good is not exported in 2010, we assign it a 2010
rank of N+1, where N is the total number of goods exported in the corresponding country
in 2010. Although not an ideal solution for disappearing products, it is not an issue for
top 10 goods and top 20 goods, and rarely an issue otherwise, because if a top good is
exported in 1998 it is almost always exported in 2010. We then compute the average
across all countries of the Pearson correlation between ranks in 1998 and in 2010. 22 The
average maximal number of goods that a country exports in 1998 is reported in the last
column of Table 4.
Table 4-A illustrates the pervasiveness of instability of exported goods. Rank
correlations are less than 0.3 for goods. The rank correlations are even lower when we
exclude commodities and extractables, and focus on top 20 goods. Table 4-B reports
similar patterns for flows (product-by-destination), although, not surprisingly, the
magnitude of correlations is smaller. The upshot of Figure 7 and Table 4 is simple:
Churning is pervasive, and particularly so within the top exported goods.

correlation between ranks of top flows that were exported in 1998 and their ranks in
2010. See text above for more details. Data: COMTRADE.
We now ask: Is the degree of instability and churning related to country
characteristics? Using data on exports in 1998 and 2010 we define which goods belonged
to either the top 10 or top 20 exports for each country-year. We estimate the probability
that 1998 top goods remain at the top in 2010, looking at the relation with good and
country characteristics. We estimate linear probability model regressions of the type
(1)

𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔,𝑐𝑐,2010 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽 ∙ 1�𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑔𝑔,𝑐𝑐,1998 � + 𝛾𝛾 ∙ 𝑋𝑋𝑔𝑔,𝑐𝑐 ∙ 1�𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑔𝑔,𝑐𝑐,1998 � + 𝛿𝛿 ∙ 𝑋𝑋𝑔𝑔,𝑐𝑐 + µ𝑔𝑔,𝑐𝑐 ,

where 𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔,𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 = 1�𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑔𝑔,𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 � is an indicator for good g in country c is a top good in year t =

1998 or 2010, and Xg,c stands for the characteristics of the good g and country c in 1998,

which can be interacted with 1�𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑔𝑔,𝑐𝑐,1998 �. 23 Since some of the right hand side

regressors vary only by country (not by country and good), we cluster standard errors by
country (Moulton, 1990). We report descriptive statistics and correlations in the
appendix.

23

We also estimated corresponding probit models, with similar results, which are available upon request.

31

Table 5 shows that without conditioning on any other information, the probability of
remaining a top 20 good is around 0.54, a small probability in itself, which indicates the
high degree of churning into and out of the top 20 group. Column 2 shows that overall,
goods exported from richer countries have a lower probability to be in the top 20, by
virtue of these countries exporting more products. 24 But the probability of remaining a
top 20 good – conditional on being a top 20 good in 1998 – is increasing in the level of
GDP per capita of the country: Richer countries exhibit less instability. 25 Figure 9
illustrates that this result also holds when we look at flows (goods-by-destinations) rather
than goods.

24

This is not inconsistent with Fernandes, Freund and Pierola (2016), who illustrate that the intensive margin within
firms is more important for determining concentration than the extensive margin across firms. Since multiproduct firms are
more prevalent in rich countries, their findings are consistent with the extensive margin across products being more
important for determining concentration in rich versus poor countries.
25
This is consistent with results in Fernandes, Freund and Pierola (2016), who find greater instability (entry and exit)
at the firm level in developing countries.

32

In column 3 of Table 5 we add controls for concentration: The Herfindahl Index over
Destinations for each product exported from each source exporting country. Higher
concentration across destinations reduces the probability of a good to be in the top:
Goods that are exported more evenly and to more destinations are more likely to be a top
good. Higher concentration across destinations also reduces chances of remaining a top
20 good: Top goods that are exported more evenly and to more destinations are more
likely to remain a top good. This result is significant, because it indicates the importance
of destination-specific factors in determining instability, and we investigate this
relationship further below. As we saw above, richer (OECD) countries are less
concentrated by destination, and this can help explain part of the relationship of
instability with income, as the coefficient to ln(Initial GDP per capita) x Top in Start
Year drops by 40%. This is also evident in the correlations table in the appendix.

33

Figure 9: Marginal Effects of GDP per Capita on Persistence of Top 20 Export Flows.
The figure reports the predicted probability of being a top 20 flow in 2010 for flows that
were (Top0 = 1) and were not (Top0 = 0) top 20 in 1998. The dashed line is the
unconditional probability of a top 20 flow in 1998 of being a top 20 flow in 2010. See text
above for more details. Data: COMTRADE.
Next, we check that our selection of years is not driving our results. We perform a
similar analysis while allowing either initial or end years to change. First, we fix the
initial year 1998 and look at the probability of remaining top goods in each year from
1999 to 2010. Then we estimate the reverse probability that goods that are top in 2010
were also among the top in the previous years. These regressions also serve as a test on
the risk of measurement error in the data. If measurement error explains our results, we
would expect that the probability estimates to fluctuate erratically with no trend over

34

time. They actually show a smooth trend, which is more consistent with gradual entry of
new products and exit of old ones.
We first fit following linear probability models of the following form
(2)

𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔,𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡 ∙ 1�𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑔𝑔,𝑐𝑐,1998 � + µ𝑔𝑔,𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 ,

where 𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡 is the coefficient of interest, t = 1999, 2000,… 2010. Figure 10 reports the

sequence of 𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡 ’s, (which are all precisely estimated) which are the probabilities of being

a top 20 good in year t, conditional on being a top good in 1998. The decline in the
probability of being in the top 20 goods is smooth, which suggests that measurement
error is not solely driving our results.

Figure 10 also illustrates that persistence in Africa (as a simple way to capture low
income countries) is lower than in the OECD countries, and that this is true over all
horizons. A similar figure for the probability of being in the top 20 goods in 2010
conditional on being top in year t=2009, 2008…1998 delivers a similar message (and is
available upon request).

Figure 10: The figure reports the predicted probability of being a top 20 good in each
year conditional on being a top 20 good in 1998. See text above for more details. Data:
COMTRADE.
Figure 11 reports the coefficient to the interaction of income with being a top export
good in 1998, 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 , which captures the differential effect of income on persistence:
(3)

𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔,𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡 ∙ 1�𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑔𝑔,𝑐𝑐,1998 � + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 ∙ 1�𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑔𝑔,𝑐𝑐,1998 � ∙ log(𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐) +
+ 𝛿𝛿𝑡𝑡 ∙ log(𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐) + µ𝑔𝑔,𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡

The effect is always positive (and always precisely estimated), and remains similar for all
time difference lengths, despite a weak overall downward trend. This implies that richer
countries exhibit greater persistence of goods in the top, and that this effect is always
positive and relatively stable, regardless of the time horizon.

top good over time (Top 20, Goods). The figure reports the marginal effect of GDP on the
predicted probability of being a top 20 good in 2010 for goods that were top 20 in 1998.
See text above for more details. Data: COMTRADE.
We now ask: Is having more instability of top exports associated with worse export
growth performance? We estimate specifications like equation (2), where we differentiate
by high, medium and low export growth. Here “high” is defined as being at or above the
75th percentile of export growth, “medium” as being between 25th and 75th percentiles,
and “low” as being at or below the 25th percentile. In Figure 12 we find that a higher exit

37

rate out of the top 20 goods for countries with more rapid overall export growth, and this
difference becomes larger with longer horizons. 26

20 good in each year for goods that were top 20 in 1998 for different groups of countries
according to their total export growth between 1998 and the year in the horizontal axis.
Here “high” is defined as being at or above the 75th percentile of export growth,
“medium” as being between 25th and 75th percentiles, and “low” as being at or below
the 25th percentile. Data: COMTRADE.

26

We focus on top 20 goods, but results are similar if using top 10 goods or flows; these results are available upon
request. When we go in the opposite direction, the message is on instability is the same: goods that were in the top 20
category in 2010 have a differentially smaller chance of being in that category in earlier years for high export growth
countries. This figure is available upon request.

38

In conclusion, this section presented the key finding of the paper – that instability of
top exports is surprisingly high for all countries. The probability of remaining in the top
exports falls smoothly with time, which suggests that simple i.i.d. measurement error is
not solely driving the results. Across countries, instability is higher along the same splits
featured in the previous section: low income vs. high income, Africa vs. OECD, and high
export growth vs. low export growth.

V. Sources of Instability

So far we have illustrated the great degree of concentration in exports, and the
instability within top exports. We now turn to characterizing the sources of this
instability. A better accounting of the underlying sources of instability can inform theory
and policy alike.
At the most basic level we can characterize an export flow along these dimensions:
(i)

Exporter

(source

country)

characteristics

(absolute

advantage

due

to

infrastructure, export barriers, aggregate productivity, etc.);
(ii)

Importer (destination country) characteristics (wealth or income level, import
barriers, etc.);

(iii)

Products (quality, world taste or demand, etc.).

We extend this to include the following interactions:
(iv)

Source-product

characteristics

(comparative

advantage:

distribution

of

productivity across goods in exporter country, and other cost-driven product
variation, etc.);
(v)

Destination-product characteristics (taste for particular good in destination,
productivity of good as an input at the destination, particular import barriers for
specific product in importer country, etc.);

(vi)

Source-destination bilateral characteristics (distance, trade relations, etc.).

39

We describe the importance of each of these dimensions in accounting for variation in
trade flow growth. We do this in a non-parametric way, by studying the importance of
each dimension using the variance (and covariance) share of fixed effects in the total
variance.
The estimation framework starts from a gravity-inspired equation for log exports x
from source s to destination d of product p in time t,
(4)

𝑥𝑥𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 + 𝜃𝜃𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝜗𝜗𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝛽𝛽𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝛾𝛾𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 + 𝛿𝛿𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 + 𝜌𝜌𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 + 𝜀𝜀𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 ,

where 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 captures a global aggregate trend in total trade; 𝜃𝜃𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 captures the aggregate

productivity (absolute advantage) in source country s in time t; 𝜗𝜗𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 captures the

comparative advantage of source country s in product p in time t; 𝛽𝛽𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 captures the
bilateral factors that affect exporting from s to destination country d in time t; 𝛾𝛾𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝

captures global demand for product p in time t; 𝛿𝛿𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 captures the aggregate demand in
destination country d in time t; 𝜌𝜌𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 captures the relative demand in destination d for

product p in time t; and 𝜀𝜀𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is the residual which may reflect source-destination-product

specific demand or supply shocks over time. 27 Taking first differences of (4) from 1998

to 2010 we have
(5)

𝑥𝑥𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝜃𝜃𝑠𝑠 + 𝜗𝜗𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝛽𝛽𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝛾𝛾𝑝𝑝 + 𝛿𝛿𝑑𝑑 + 𝜌𝜌𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 + 𝜀𝜀𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 ,

where a variable without time subscript is in changes, e.g., 𝛼𝛼 = 𝛼𝛼2010 − 𝛼𝛼1998 . We

estimate (5) by exploiting the variation in exports flows of different products across
sources and destinations.

27

Each of these components can be characterized in a gravity model. However, this representation ignores the concept
of “structural gravity”, e.g., the inter-linkages between source and destination fixed effects.

40

In order to avoid losing observations that either end or start with zero exports, we
replace log differences on the left hand side of (5) with bounded growth
(6)

𝑥𝑥𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 1

𝑥𝑥𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,2010 −𝑥𝑥𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,1998

�𝑥𝑥𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,2010 +𝑥𝑥𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,1998 �

2

,

which has the virtue of explicitly taking into account new goods that emerge, as well as
old goods that disappear. That is, we take into account 𝑥𝑥𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 export values that are zero.
Estimating (7) using all countries at once is not feasible given the computation power
available to us. Therefore, we estimate (7) separately for each country and then recover
the estimates in (7) by computing the appropriate averages and computing the deviations
of the original estimates from averages. See the appendix for complete details on this.
After estimating the fixed effects (FE), we describe the results for the average country
in the sample. To do this, we first compute the share in total variance of each type of FE,
covariance and residuals, separately for each country; then we compute the average share
for the average country. In the appendix we report results for average countries across
regional subsamples and degrees of export growth. We estimate fixed effects and
evaluate the sources of export growth twice: Once for top 20 exports (defined either in
1998 or 2010), and for all exports. This is informative because it allows us to see whether
the sources of export growth are materially different for top 20 exports versus the rest.
Then we repeat the estimation in a sample that takes into account only strictly positive
flows in 1998 and 2010, i.e. eliminating new and disappearing export flows. This serves
as a sensitivity analysis to the use of bounded growth.
Table 6 reports the results. The first row reports the average standard deviation of
bounded growth for each sample. This number can be compared to 4, which is the range
of bounded growth. Unsurprisingly, it is lower when we exclude new and disappearing
flows. There is some variation across subsamples, but the broad message is similar:

41

variation in export growth for top 20 goods is driven by all dimensions. The single largest
dimension is the residual, accounting for about one-third or one half of overall variance.

Table 6. Variance decompositions of export growth of export flows in 1998-2010 for the
average country. There are four subsamples: top 20 exports, all export flows, and the
same while restricting to strictly positive export flows in both 1998 and 2010. Columns
do not sum exactly to 100 because other covariance terms are not reported here; these
covariance terms account for small shares of overall variance. Data: COMTRADE.

The key result in Table 6 is that variation in comparative advantage (Source x Product)
accounts for only 18-19% of overall variation in export growth, or 31% when we do not
consider new and disappearing flows. Thus, variation in comparative advantage is
relatively less important for new and disappearing export flows; other sources of
variation are more important for these products. The role of comparative advantage by
itself (Source x Product) is smaller than we expected. This suggests that theories of
export success that focus only on comparative advantage (and the policies motivated by
such stories) may be missing much of the origins of export success. It is particularly
telling that these results are similar for countries with high, medium and low total export
growth, and across different regions (results reported in the appendix).
In general, whether or not we consider new and disappearing flows, the following
factors are more important for top 20 exports: Variation in bilateral conditions (Source x

42

Destination), destination demand for specific products (Product x Destination), and
variation in aggregate demand for product. Not surprisingly, the residual becomes much
more important outside of the top 20 exports and picks up most of the difference.
Aggregate demand from the destination accounts for 11% of the variance, but only 2-3%
when we ignore new and disappearing flows.
It is notable that the global product, destination and Destination x Product interaction
effects, together account for a similar share of overall variation as the sum of effects
involving the source country, Source x Product and Source x Destination, even though
the latter does not capture strictly only source country effects – except when we consider
all flows and exclude new and disappearing flows. While we cannot rigorously use this
decomposition to locate the micro origins of the shocks driving export flows, these results
suggest that a lot of action in exports is not driven by source country factors alone. The
upshot is that perhaps too much export success or failure is attributed to the source
countries as opposed to demand effects coming from outside the source country. This
helps us understand why specializations are so unstable – they are at the mercy of
demand effects coming from many different sources.
The variance decomposition involves also covariance terms between different sources
of export growth. Table 6 reports the only one that is of significant magnitude,
Cov(Product , Source x Product), and only when we restrict to top 20 exports. All other
covariance terms are very small, and many are virtually zero (all are reported in the
appendix). 28

We draw a few conclusions from this part of our analysis. First, trade models that rely
only on variation in comparative advantage, bilateral forces and destination income –

28

We test whether variance shares correlate with income per capita and concentration. We find that Comparative
advantage (Source x Product) and bilateral forces (Source x Destination) account for less of overall variance for richer
countries and with more diversified countries. These results are reported in the appendix. However, since these are shares
within overall variance, it is difficult to relate these to the stability regressions reported in Table 5.

43

e.g., Eaton and Kortum (2002) at the aggregate level – are insufficient for explaining
export growth at the more granular level. Adding demand shocks is necessary, as Eaton,
Kortum and Kramarz (2011) illustrate at the firm level. This is consistent with Gaubert
and Itskhoki (2016), who find that granular firm-level shocks are important for
understanding industry-level comparative advantage. Here we investigate the potential
sources of these shocks, and we find that much of the variation originates outside of the
exporting-country.

Second, and related to the first point, our results inform policy. Only 20% of the
variation in export growth can be explained by variation in comparative advantage
(Source x Product), leaving the lion’s share to other forces that are outside the realm of
national export promotion and industrial policies. Less than 20% of the variation in
export growth can be explained by variation in bilateral forces (Source x Destination),
and even these are not easily influenced by source country policies (arguably, multilateral
trade resistance and destination tariff levels are not easily modified by source country
policies). The high shares of product, destination, and product x destination effects
further diminishes the emphasis on the nations where the exports originate.

Finally, the high share of idiosyncratic variance (Residual at the source-productdestination level of variation), importantly even for top 20 goods, points to even less
ability to plan export successes through industrial policies. These results suggest it would
be better to emphasize policies that can affect the ease of doing business more generally,
and letting entrepreneurs in the source countries find markets for their products on their
own (while also encouraging entrepreneurs in the destination countries to source products
in the nations of origin).

44

VI. Conclusions

We contribute to the literature that documents the phenomenon of extreme export
specialization and “granularity”, where a few narrow product categories or export flows
(here, at the 4-digit level) account for a surprisingly high share of total exports. Our most
novel finding is that these specializations are not persistent over time. Using data from
1998 to 2010, we observe major reshufflings of the top ranks across products between
1998 and 2010 for all countries, including the entry of some products in 2010 that were
nonexistent in 1998, and the disappearance of some goods that were in the top 20 in
1998. The instability holds also for export flows when including the destination
component. Instability is somewhat lower for richer economies, and economies where
exports are more diversified. Measurement error is unlikely to be an important
determinant of this pattern.
In order to understand the instability of top exports we decompose the variance of
growth from 1998 to 2010 of exports of product p from source s into variations due to (1)
comparative advantage (source-by-product effects), (2) bilateral trade (source-bydestination effects), (3) global product growth (product effects), (4) overall destination
demand growth (destination effects), (5) product-specific destination demand growth
(destination-by-product effects), and (6) a residual. Our key finding is that changes in
comparative advantage play a smaller role than we expected – only about 20 percent of
the variance. We find that forces that do not involve the source country – see (3), (4) and
(5) above – are as important as those that do – for example (1) and (2). The residual (6)
accounts for about a third of the variance, stressing even more the instability and
unpredictability of even the top export specializations. Richer economies’ export growth
is driven less by variation in comparative advantage and bilateral ties, as well as
economies with more diversified export networks. This may reflect greater importance of
intra-industry trade in more developed economies, which rely on trade networks for
differentiated goods.

45

Together these findings suggest that the common attribution of export successes and
failures to the policies or other characteristics of the source country is exaggerated. The
forces operating outside the source country (product trends, total destination demand, or
product-specific destination) play a larger role than usually appreciated, and even
bilateral relationships (source-by-destination effects), which account for 20 percent of
overall variance, reflect policies and other characteristics in the destination importing
country as much as in the source country. The shocks coming from outside the country
help us understand the instability of top export specializations.
The combination of important forces in export specialization coming from outside the
country and the remarkably high instability and unpredictability of top specializations
imply that industrial policies that try to guide specialization will face grave challenges
coping with fast-moving shocks. The findings could support policies that allow local
entrepreneurs to rapidly enter and exit specializations by product and destination in
response to rapidly changing opportunities in the global trade market.

Table A3: Export growth across regions and types of goods. Details: “Avg. Country” is
the average country level export growth (1998 = 100) in each region; “Top 5 in 1998”
refers to the 5 biggest countries in each region in 1998; “with share >10% in 1998”
refers to the countries which exported more than 10% of total exported in each region in
1998; Median, Perc. 90th and Perc. 10th refer to the corresponding country quantile in
each region regarding export growth; “w/o extractable” and “w/o ext. or commodity”
removes the corresponding set of goods from the exports calculations.

D. Top Exports Churning: Additional Figures

In Uganda, electrical energy went from being #5 in 1998 to #28 in 2010, while cement
went from #14 to #4. Cement in 1998 had almost all gone to Democratic Republic of
Congo, but Uganda had added an even larger market in Rwanda in 2010 (possibly
reflecting Rwanda’s rapid growth from 1998 to 2010). Cell phones also show a big
increase in rank as an export; these are likely to be re-exports, since imports of cell
phones are even larger and it is unlikely that Uganda is manufacturing cell phones as a
final good.

56

In Japan, computers went from the #3 export in 1998 to #67 in 2010, while printing
machinery went from #50 in 1998 to #7 in 2010. Japan’s #5 export in 2010 was
“Machines used to produce semiconductors, integrated circuits, and flat panels”, while
this category was virtually nonexistent in 1998. In the richer countries at the
technological frontier, technology changes are an added source of export instability.

Table A4: Descriptive statistics and pairwise correlations for regressions in Table 5. All
statistics based on the sample in Table 5, a maximum of 103 cross country observations,
depending on data availability, except for Initial Herfindahl Index over Destinations,
which is a sample of 90,317 country-by-product observations. Initial Herfindahl Index
over Destinations is calculated for each product and each source exporting country.
Destination Concentration Index is the weighted average of the Initial Herfindahl Index
over Destinations within a source exporting country, where the weights are export
values. Source for export is COMTRADE. Source for GDP, population, land mass and
credit (M3) are from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators. All variables
pertain to 1998 (hence, “initial”).

60

F. True Growth and Bounded Growth
Bounded growth is a monotonic transformation of true growth, that has a range of [-2,2];
-2 represents disappearing goods that were exported in 1998 but not in 2010, and 2
represents new goods that were not exported in 1998 but are in 2010:
𝑥𝑥𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 1

𝑥𝑥𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,2010 −𝑥𝑥𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,1998

+𝑥𝑥𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,1998 �
�𝑥𝑥
2 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,2010

,

where 𝑥𝑥𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 is the value in year t of (in our case) exports from source s to destination d

of product p, and 𝑥𝑥𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is the value of bounded growth. Thus, bounded growth has the
virtue of explicitly taking into account new goods that emerge, as well as old goods that
disappear. That is, we take into account 𝑥𝑥𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 export values that are zero. While bounded

growth is always strictly below true growth except at zero, it is a good approximation for
true growth that is not extreme. For example, when true growth is between -40% and
50%, bounded growth is less than 10 percent points below it. Bounded growth deviates
from true growth the most for new (∞ is represented by 2) and disappearing goods (-1 is
represented by -2). The following figures illustrate these features.

G. Fixed Effect Estimation

Our estimation specification is
𝑥𝑥𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝜃𝜃𝑠𝑠 + 𝜗𝜗𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝛽𝛽𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝛾𝛾𝑔𝑔 + 𝛿𝛿𝑑𝑑 + 𝜌𝜌𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 + 𝜀𝜀𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 ,
where all variables are in changes, e.g., 𝛼𝛼 = 𝛼𝛼2010 − 𝛼𝛼1998 : 𝛼𝛼 captures changes in

global aggregate demand; 𝜃𝜃𝑠𝑠 captures changes in aggregate productivity (absolute
advantage) in country s; 𝜗𝜗𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 captures changes in the comparative advantage of country s

in product p; 𝛽𝛽𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 captures changes in bilateral factors (bilateral resistance) that affect

63

exporting from source country s to destination country d; 𝛾𝛾𝑝𝑝 changes in global aggregate

demand for product p; 𝛿𝛿𝑑𝑑 captures changes in aggregate demand in destination country d;
𝜌𝜌𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 captures changes in relative demand in destination d for product p; and 𝜀𝜀𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is the

residual, which may reflect changes in source-destination-product specific demand or
supply shocks.
Estimating this using all countries directly is not computationally feasible due to the
large number of dummy variables present. The purpose of this section is to show how
these estimates can be recovered from a country-by-country estimation.
Fixing a country s, we can estimate a simple regression with product and destination
fixed effects
𝑠𝑠
𝑠𝑠
𝑥𝑥𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
= 𝜋𝜋 𝑠𝑠 + 𝜋𝜋𝑔𝑔𝑠𝑠 + 𝜋𝜋𝑑𝑑𝑠𝑠 + 𝜋𝜋𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
,

where 𝜋𝜋 𝑠𝑠 is a source country s-specific intercept, 𝜋𝜋𝑔𝑔𝑠𝑠 is source country s-specific product

𝑠𝑠
g fixed effect, 𝜋𝜋𝑑𝑑𝑠𝑠 source country s-specific destination d fixed effect and 𝜋𝜋𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
is source

country s-specific residual.

Comparing with the above we see that 𝜋𝜋 𝑠𝑠 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝜃𝜃𝑠𝑠 ; 𝜋𝜋𝑔𝑔𝑠𝑠 = 𝛾𝛾𝑔𝑔 + 𝜗𝜗𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 ; 𝜋𝜋𝑑𝑑𝑠𝑠 = 𝛿𝛿𝑑𝑑 +

𝑠𝑠
𝛽𝛽𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 and 𝜋𝜋𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
= 𝜌𝜌𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 + 𝜀𝜀𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 . Therefore, we can recover our parameters of interest by

taking the appropriate averages. We first collect all our country-by-country estimates by
assigning the ones corresponding to each trade flow. Note that this repeats some of the
fixed effects. For example, consider exports of good g from country s to destinations d1

𝑠𝑠
𝑠𝑠
and d2. These two flows constitute two vectors of fixed effects: [𝜋𝜋 𝑠𝑠 , 𝜋𝜋𝑔𝑔𝑠𝑠 , 𝜋𝜋𝑑𝑑1
, 𝜋𝜋𝑑𝑑1𝑔𝑔
] and
𝑠𝑠
𝑠𝑠
[𝜋𝜋 𝑠𝑠 , 𝜋𝜋𝑔𝑔𝑠𝑠 , 𝜋𝜋𝑑𝑑2
, 𝜋𝜋𝑑𝑑2𝑔𝑔
]. Hence, in this example, 𝜋𝜋 𝑠𝑠 and 𝜋𝜋𝑔𝑔𝑠𝑠 are repeated. In general, 𝜋𝜋 𝑠𝑠 will be

repeated for each flow from country s. Similarly, 𝜋𝜋𝑔𝑔𝑠𝑠 will be repeated for each flow of

good g from country s, and 𝜋𝜋𝑑𝑑𝑠𝑠 will be repeated for each flow from country s to

64

destination d. In order to allow weighting we add the average value of the s-d-g flow in
𝑠𝑠
𝑠𝑠
𝑥𝑥𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑,1998
+𝑥𝑥𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑,2010

1998 and 2010 to the vector of estimates, i.e. [

2

𝑠𝑠
𝑠𝑠
, 𝜋𝜋 𝑠𝑠 , 𝜋𝜋𝑔𝑔𝑠𝑠 , 𝜋𝜋𝑑𝑑2
, 𝜋𝜋𝑑𝑑2𝑔𝑔
].

Now we can extract the estimates of interest by taking the appropriate averages
(weighing if desired). For example, without using weights, to identify 𝛼𝛼 we take the
average of 𝜋𝜋� 𝑠𝑠

𝑁𝑁𝑓𝑓

1
� 𝜋𝜋� 𝑆𝑆(𝑓𝑓)
𝛼𝛼� =
𝑁𝑁𝑓𝑓
𝑓𝑓=1

where 𝑆𝑆(𝑓𝑓) returns the country of flow f and 𝑁𝑁𝑓𝑓 is the total number of flows. Then, the

following deviations identify 𝜃𝜃𝑠𝑠 :

𝜃𝜃�𝑠𝑠 = 𝜋𝜋� 𝑠𝑠 − 𝛼𝛼�.

In order to retrieve 𝛿𝛿𝑑𝑑 we take the average of 𝜋𝜋�𝑑𝑑𝑠𝑠 over flows with destination d
𝛿𝛿̂𝑑𝑑 =

1

𝑁𝑁𝑓𝑓
∑𝑓𝑓=1 1{𝐷𝐷(𝑓𝑓)=𝑑𝑑}

𝑁𝑁

𝑆𝑆(𝑓𝑓)
𝑓𝑓
∑𝑓𝑓=1
𝜋𝜋�𝐷𝐷(𝑓𝑓) 1{𝐷𝐷(𝑓𝑓) = 𝑑𝑑},

where 𝐷𝐷(𝑓𝑓) returns the destination of flow f and 1{𝐷𝐷(𝑓𝑓) = 𝑑𝑑} is the identity function that

returns one if the destination of flow f is d. Then, 𝛽𝛽𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is identified by the appropriate

deviation

𝛽𝛽̂𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 𝜋𝜋�𝑑𝑑𝑠𝑠 − 𝛿𝛿̂𝑑𝑑 .

Similar analysis can be done to obtain the rest of the estimates of interest.

Table A8. Variance decompositions of export growth of all NON-ZERO export flows in
1998-2010 for the average country within each subset of countries. The sample is
restricted to export flows that are strictly positive in both 1998 and 2010. Countries are
classified as “low” export growth if their export growth is at or below the 25th
percentile, “medium” if between 25th and 75th percentiles, and “high” if export growth
is at or above the 75th percentile of export distribution. Data: COMTRADE.

I. Correlates of Components of Variance Decomposition
We regress the shares from Table 6 for top 20 exports and all export flows (including
new and disappearing flows) on log GDP per capita and on the Destinations
Concentration Index (both in 1998). Table A9 reports the results. Comparative advantage
(Source x Product) and bilateral forces (Source x Destination) account for less of overall
variance for richer countries and with more diversified countries.

Table A9. Variance shares, income and export diversification. The Table reports OLS
estimates of how variance shares vary across countries with log GDP per capita and with
the Destination Concentration Index. GDP data are from the World Bank’s World
Development Indicators. Destination Concentration Index is the weighted average of the
Initial Herfindahl Index over destinations within a source exporting country, where the
weights are export values. Both regressors pertain to 1998. Source for exports is
COMTRADE.
