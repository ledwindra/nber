Supply Versus flemand Approaches to
the Problem of Stagflation

APSTRACT

We develop a model of aggregate supply and demand in the open economy
to explain the important characteristics of international macroeconomic

adjustment in the 1970s. Traditional demand—oriented models cannot account
for the worldwide phenomenon of rising inflation and unemployment in the
mid—70s, or for the failure of most industrialized economies to recover

from the deep recession of 1974—75. When aggregate supply is carefully
treated, it is found that much of the inflation and sluggish output performance may be attributed to the jump in the real costs of intermediate
inputs and the failure of real wages to adjust downward after the input

price shock. A simulation model shows that fuel inputs are sufficiently
important in production that a large part of the worldwide recession may he
attributed to the change in the relative price of oil, since 1973. In an
empirical section, it is suggested that countries differ in their response
to supply shocks and macro—policies because of differences in key stuctural
relationships, particularly in wage determination.

SUPPLY VERSUS ULMAND APPROAChES TO TILE PROBLEM OF STAGFLATION*

INTRODUCTION

This

paper deals with the co-existence of inflation and unemployment in

industrial countries in the l970s. The period since 1972 marks a departure
from the previous decade in more than one important respect. It began
with an extraordinary spurt of inflation that in many countries is only

now receding. The inflation has been marked by great divergences in rates
between countries. It seems to be generally agreed that the oil crisis
and related events had a lot to do with this upsurge in prices and that
the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system of pegged rates had a lot to •do

with the subsequent divergence of inflation rates. What is much more marked
and less well understood is the pronounced decline in output growth which started

with the worldwide recession of 1974-75. The GNP growth of the OECD
countries came down to an annual average of 3 per cent during 1973-78,

compared with about 5 per cent in the preceding decade. Productivity growth
rates came down even more, capital accumulation is still lagging, and above
all, unemployment rates, which more or less doubled since the l960s, are
on average still as high to-day as they were in 1974-75.

A prerequisite for enlightened economic policy discussion is a

reasonable understanding of the recent past, not only because past
events might recur, but because it seems as if the industrial world has

not yet recovered from the 1974-75 episode. The most natural reaction to
persistent unemployment, for a world brought up on Keynes, is to think of
it

purely

under

in terms of a shortfall in aggregate demand. The oil price

hike

such a view, can be looked upon as an excise levied by OPEC on the

industrial world, not enough of which has been spent to keep cconomc

activity at earlier levels. According to this view the slack may be fully
eliminated

with a sufficient boost to demand on a co-ordinated world scale

(leaving aside special problems such as the uneniployment of the young or

other particular social groups). Inflation persists because of strong
inflationary expectations following the commodity boom, but the inflationunemployment trade-off of the Phillips curve must, in this view, bring

inflation down. A more monetarist point of view, according to which there
is no such policy trade-off, gives a reasonably good account of divergences
in inflation rates between countries but is hard put to explain persistent
unemployment.

In ourview,

stagflation cannot be understood only in aggregate demand or

purely monetary terms. Accelerating goods prices and increasing unemployment
suggest the co-existence of demand pressure in the commodity market and excess

supplyinthe labour market.' This is precisely thenatureofa real supply

shock, suchaswascausedbythe rise inoil and raw materials prices in
l972..74.2 An increase in the price of a variable factor of production, such
as oil, may reduce profits, output, and the input of other variable factors,

such as labour, unless their relative price adjusts downwards. If real.
wages are sticky, which, by and large, they have been, unemployment will
result.

Such a recession can further be exacerbated by restrictive domestic
demand management, which may be required to combat inflation and rising
current-account deficits, and by the accompanying fall in investment demand.

It is precisely because of the existence of demand-induced elements that
it is all too easy to attribute all of the unemployment to Keynesian
factors, although a large part it is really of a 'classical' nature.
That part caii only be eliminated by a fall in real wages or increased

capital accumulation, neither of which is likely to occur in the short run.
Because supply shocks are a fairly complex and new problem a large
part of our paper (Section I) is devoted to a theoretical discussion of the
effect of supply and demand shocks in a representative open economy and the

various policy responses to them. This is done by means of a diagrammatic
exposition of a model presented in greater technical detail elsewhere.
It is followed in Section II by a brief study of global considerations and
multi-country interactions.

The relative prices of raw materials have since dropped buck to their

previous level, but the higher level of relative oil prices has so far
persisted (see Table 5 in Section III).

Gordon (1975), Phelps (1978), and Solow (1978).

One may believe that a supply shock will reduce output in the short

run without being convinced that the 1973 oil-price rise played a major role

in

the world recession that followed. The quantitative evidence of Section

III argues that it did. There we present a realistic simulation model (for
a representative economy and for a two-country world) and some econometric
estimates of important relationships (labour market behaviour, investment

demand, etc.) for seven major industrial economies. It is important to
stress that countries will differ in their response to supply shocks and
macro policies precisely because of differences in one or more of these
key structural relationships.5
The analysis in this paper is almost exclusively short-run in nature
An important issue, the long-term repercussions on capital accuiiiulation,

is only mentioned in passing. Likewise the long-run effects of current-

account imbalances and the important structural effects on developed
economies of LDC industrialization are left out of the present paper.

Both Mork and Hall (1978) and Hudson and Jorgenson (1978) have found
substantial real effects of energy price changes for the United States.

Separate studies by the authors of this paper (Bruno, 1979, and Sachs,
1978) have dealt with aspects of these relationships in other OECD
countries. •

For example, the United States may be characterized by nominal wage
rigidity and may therefore be more output—responsive to monetary policy.
Many European countries would be better described in terms of real wage
rigidity and are therefore more likely to translate money growth into
an immediate price rise.

It is certainly a mistake to base one's views

on observations of only one country.

2'JIE REPIiESENTATIVE OPEN ECONOMY

An understanding of stagflation necessitates a careful specification of

at least two markets, the market for final domestic goods and the labour

market. Our analysis here is based on a model that was laid out and
discussed in much greater detail elsewhere (Bruno and Sachs, 1979,

henceforth MEA). We shall concentrate mainly on a simplified diagrammatic
exposition, leaving the algebra and a quantitative amplification to Section
III.

While discussing the individual economy it is easiest to consider

external market conditions as exogenously given; this assumption is relaxed
in Section II. We distinguish between two exogenous condriodity prices, the

foreign price of intermediate goods, later to be represented by energy,

and the foreign price of final goods. These prices, in logarithmic form,

respectively. The relative price will be

denoted by ir (= p*

Intermediate goods are used as a major input

(n) in the domestic production of final goods (q), together with labour

() and capital (k). Intermediate goods may also be produced domestically

We

shall use lower-case letters to denote logarithms of upper-case

variables. Thus p* is the log of the price level

at the given world price and such import substitution (or even net export)
may

provide one source of international differences in

industrial structure.

The

single domestic final good, q, whose price is p, will be an imperfect
substitute for the foreign final good in both consumption and exports. The
domestic

rate

price of the foreign good is (p* + e),

where e is the exchange

in domestic currency per unit of foreign exchange. The relative price

of the final good (

or the terms of trade, will be one

important endogenous variable to be determined in the commodity market.

The analysis

in

of the domestic final goods market (Figure 1) is best conducted

its relative price, ir, as defined above.

In

order to conclude something about the behaviour of the absolute price level,
p, we still need a theory to determine the nominal

exchange rate, e.

Under a fixed exchange—rate regime it can be considered exogenous while
under a float it will be determined by money and an asset market and

therefore outside the commodity market. This will be discussed separately.
For the moment we only have to remember that

p = ir + p* + e and that for

given final goods price (p*) and given exchange rate (e) any change in the
terms of trade (ir) implies an equal change in the price level (p).

when the economy operates below capacity. As indicated earlier the

supply

curve is here drawn with the relative price of the intermediate good
(ii =

- p*)

and the real wage (Wc) as given parameters. Any increase

in one of these raises variable production costs and therefore shifts the

S curve up and to the left, while any increase in the capital stock will
shift the curve down and to the right.

Let us next briefly summarize the demand side of the model. Consider
the main components of final demand: private and public consumption,
investment, and exports. Private consumption of the domestic good is
considered a positive function of real disposable income and a negative
function of the terms of trade (iT

p - e

-

p*)•

Exports are similarly a

positive function of world income (y*) and a negative function of

rr.

Investment is considered a negative function of the externally given
real interest rate, R*, and a positive function of the rate of profitJ°
Once this subsystem is solved out it can be summarized in the

a

forri of

demand schedule, drawn in Figure 1 as a downward sloping curve D for

a given set of parameters. This curve will be shifted up and to the right
by an increase in external demand (y*), or by domestic fiscal policy (Z).'
Similarly a shift down and to the left may be caused by an increase
in the real interest rate (R*) or by an increase in the real wage (we).
The assumed sign of the latter in the demand curve comes from its supply
effect on the production and use of intermediate goods and through

10Money might also affect the system through the investment channel. More
on this in Section III.

The role of the relative foreign price of intermediate
goods is

ambiguous, because of conflicting forces at work. A rise in

at a

given production level of intermediate goods will depress the real income and

consumption of a net importer of these goods while the substitution effect
and a possible increase in the domestic production of intermediate goods

will work in the other direction. For a net importer of intermediate goods
thedemand curve is thus likely to

shift to the left with an increase in

.

For a net exporter of

intermediate goods or for an economy in which there is considerable domestic
substitutability the shift may go in the other direction.'3 For most OECD
countries the first is the more likely.

Consider now the effect of two kinds of possible changes in the system.
An import price shock,, involving an increase in the relative price n'

shifts the supply curve unambiguously to the left (see the shift from S

to St in Figure la), leading to excess demand of the amount AA' at the
initial price ir.

effect of the rise in

excess demand will be reduced, but the new

equilibrium at point A will in any case involve a reduction in output.
What will happen to the relative price ir

the supply curve is relatively flat and the effect on the supply curve

If

there are marked differences between the propensities to consume out

possibility is ignored here.

For the same reasons the demand curve may itself be upward-sloping (see

dominates the demand shift, x will rise;'4

+

in the

opposite (and for an OECD economy less likely) case, where import prices
are demand-expanding, the terms of trade will obviously rise but the net
effect on output is ambiguous.

Consider the importance of the degree of real wage stickiness in

this analysis. While we have not yet considered the labour market, it is
clear that unless there is a strong substitution effect, an output
contraction will reduce labour demand and press downward on real wages.
Assume now that nominal wages are downward flexible or that the unexpected

price shock causes a momentary reduction in real wages. In that case there

will be a force working in the commodity market in exactly
the opposite direction to that of the import price shock (consider the

signs attached in Figure 1 to shifts in we). One would obviously expect
to find different patterns of real wage response to the import price shock
in different countries (see Section III).

It is important to point out that this analysis of the effect of a

rise in import prices is confined to the short-run implications. For
example, a fall in the rate of profit and a contraction in output, in
addition to their immediate effect on investment demand (see below), may

eventually cause a fall in the capital stock, k. Also, changes in the
current account may have repercussions on domestic real wealth, thereby

affecting the demand curve. These are ignored here.

We

should

remember that the absolute price level, p. may rise even when

the relative price, rr, falls, provided the domestic price of the final

export (import) good, p + e, rises sufficiently (which has certainly
happened in all OECD countries in the 1970s).

+

- 12

-

The commodity market representation of the effect of a supply shock
is the key to an understanding of the difference between

stagflationary

effects of the kind that affected OECD economies in the early 1970s and
the more conventional business-cycle demand fluctuations which are either
inflationary or deflationary in both commodity and labour markets.
A rightward shift in the demand curve will by itself raise prices (unless

we are in a flat section of the supply curve) as well as final output

and employment (unless we are hitting

a

full

employment ceiling);

But consider now the more relevant case of a demand contraction coming
from either domestic demand restraint (Z) or from a contraction in world

demand (y*)• In Figure lb this is represented as a shift of the demand

curve from D to D' causing excess supply of the amount AA at the
given initial price ratio fl.

If prices are downward flexible the relative price would fall to

ir,

with equilibrium at A'. But suppose prices (p) are rigid so that at given

and e, the relative price stays temporarily at u. In that case
output would be constrained by demand and would fall from q

to q, with

unemployment of the conventional Keynesian kind resulting (see further

discussion below in the labour-market context). Firms would like to sell

more but are unable to do so. At point A

(Figure ib) they are, at least

temporarily, not on their supply curves. This is in marked contrast with
the previous case where output contraction originates from a supply shock.
During the 1974-75 recession there was clearly a combination of a
supply shock with a concomitant demand contraction coining from the

cumulative income reduction in all OECD countries. This was compounded
by a fall in investment and in some countries (notably the United States)

-13-

+

+

by domestic fiscal and monetary restraint as well. For this reason it is
easy to fall into the trap of attributing all of the unemployment to a wore

conventional demand contraction combined with downward price rigidity. As
pointed out by Malinvaud (1977), until recently the experience of the
industrial countries has been confined to alternations between situations

of Keynesian unemployment or inflation. The developments of 1973-75 mark
a departure from this pattern.

An import price shock, as we have seen, is most likely to cause a
rise in the relative domestic price level

p - e -

For a given e

and p* the nominal domestic price level will rise. However, it is
important to note that neither the observed price rise nor the intercountry
differences in inflation rates since 1973 can be explained without recourse
to the monetary mechanism and exchange—rate behaviour under a flexible rate

regime. For the determination of e,

markets,

attention must focus on the

asset

to which we turn briefly.

Current theory and available evidence stress that the exchange rate is the

relative price of national moneys. One important element of exchange-rate
determination is then the relative growth rates of money stocks. Our model,
like most, has the characteristic that a money supply increase in one
country leads in the long run to an equiproportiona]. depreciation of its

exchange rate and a rise in its domestic prices. Since p and e rise
by the

same amount, p

by the

money supply increase.
In

the

and output are unaffected in the long run

short run, though, the determination of domestic prices and
exchange rate is more complicated. Let us trace through the effect of a One—
the

the domestic money supply. Initially,

tend to fall. But given world capital mobility, there is an attempt

to transfer funds to world assets, which have

a temporarily higher rate of

return. With floating rates, the exchange rate depreciates (e rises);

in fact, e continues to rise until the expected returns of domestic and
foreign assets are again equalized.

As e rises, import prices and the consumer price level rise. If
nominal wages are sticky, w i.e., p - e

falls. Domestic prices do not immediately rise in

equal proportion to e.

As

real wages are restored, w

increases, pushing up the domestic price level in

the

process. Eventually,

p and e rise in the same proportion as the original

money supply change.

If the real wage is fixed in the short run, then the domestic price level
almost immediately rises in proportion to the depreciation. This is, of

course, the familiar vicious circle of depreciation and domestic inflation.
Once it is recognized that a significant part of the rccession was
classical and supply-determined, i.e., directly tied to too high real wages,

the inflationary consequences of expansionary monetary policy are highlighted.
It is important to remember, though, that

expansionary monetary policy may

have some effect on output in the short run, and that for countries like
Canada and the United States, with sluggish nominal wage change (see Section
III), the inflationary effects of the money expansion might initially be
small.

The three
rate

kinds of shift discussed here (import price shock, exchange

adjustments

and demand contraction) go quite a long way in explaining

both the deep recession of 1974-75 and the intercountry differences in

rates of inflation. But before turning back to these let us consider the

+

-15-

implications for the

labour

+

market, which in many ways mirrors the effects

already considered in the commodity market.

The Labour Market
The

curve Ld in Figuie 2 represents

the usual downward sloping

marginal

product curve here expressed in terms of the real consumption wage (w) rather
than the real Product wage (w - p).'5 The curve is derived from the
commodity

supply

schedule. The direction of the shift caused by changes in the

relative

price r

is again ambiguous because of the conflicting income and

substitution effects. It should be noted, however, that final goods
production may fall with a rise in

and yet labour demand may rise if

the substitution effect is strong enough (see, for example, Hudson and

Jorgenson, 1978). However, the most likely case for an OECD country with
low elasticity of energy Substitution is an unambiguous leftward shift in
the demand curve for labour.

In Figure 2a, which illustrates such a shift,

the result is excess supply (unemployment) of the amount BB at the

initial level of real wage w

A new equilibrium full employment at B' could be reached after a
process of downward real wage adjustment. Alternatively, if capital is a
complementary limiting factor, capital accumulation might eventually help
to shift the labour demand curve back and thus reduce unemployment. It is
doubtful whether such a corrective mechanism would come about by itself,

15 This is done to conform to the concept of real
wages that is most

appropriate from the point of view of labour supply behaviour (see
curve L5 in Figure 2) and the dynamic adjustment process.

and in any case either adjustment process would be slow to come about.16
Another option for a single country, at least in theory, would seem to

be the adoption of an expansionary fiscal policy, in the commodity
market this is represented by a rightward shift of the demand curve leading
to an increase in
the

both

output (q) and prices (

and therefore p). As

final goods price also appears as a parameter of the labour demand

curve (see Figure 2), this expresses itself as a shift back to the right
of

the Ld curve and a reduction in unemployment. The implied cost

in higher prices

and a greater current-account deficit makes this an

unlikely policy to follow for any length of time. Besides, as we shall
see below (Section II) it cannot be adopted by all supply-shocked countries
simultaneously;

when the relative price,

ir, rises in one country it

must fall in the rest of the world.
If output in the commodity market happens to be temporarily constrained

on the demand (and not on the supply) side, which is the Keynesian

case, producers will not be on their supply curve and the
relevant demand schedule for labour will be represented by the steeper

curve marked L in Figure 2, whose position will be determined mainly
by the demand variables (y*, Z).17

16

As far as capital accumulation is concerned, the movement was, if
anything, in the opposite direction (see Section JIl).

17

The capital stock, k, and the relative price, r, now appear as leftward
shifting variables while ir

is again ambiguous but more; likely to

shift the curve to the left. The relative slopes of the curves Ld

and L

are implied by the assumption that the positiveresponse of

output supply to a fall in real wages dominates the response of output
demand.

- 18

-

+

The case of a pure demand shock (see the shift from

q

to Ld

in

q

Figure 2b), with rigid real wage, brings about Xeynesian unemployment of

the amount BB, if Ld stays put. The case represented in Figure 2a
may more appropriately be termed classical unemployment, having been caused

by a shift in the whole marginal product schedule. With both types of
shocks present in the 1974-75 recession it

is,

of course, difficult to

assess how much of the unemployment at any point in time or in any specific
country may have been Keynesian or

classical,18

but it is important to

stress that given the existence of a supply shock, unemployment cannot be

cured only in a Keynesian fashion, for reasons that have already been
mentioned and to which we shall return later.

General Equilibrium
The determinants of the exchange rate and the concomitant development

of the balance of payments have been described only briefly. In 1EA we

model the deterininnts of the exchange rate under the assumption of perfect
capital mobility.

To get a better idea of how

the various

parts of the

system

are linked, consider a simplified flow-chart of our representative open
economy (see Figure 3). The top part of the chart shows the main links
from the costs of production (raw materials and labour) to the price level

(positively) and the level of output (negatively). Output in turn affects

for labour and imports. Both the demand for and the supply of
labour are affected by the (real) wage rate which in turn is adjusted in

from the demand side (fiscal and monetary policy,

exports) to output. The direct link to prices is likely to be weaker if
the supply schedule is relatively flat. The foreign sector is represented
by the components of demand for real imports'9 and

exports;

these are domestic

or world income as well as the real exchange rate •and foreign prices.20

The

exchange

rate, in turn, may in principle be affected by both the

balance of payments (capital flows are not directly shown) as well as by
monetary policy, in case of a float.
The 1973-75 story can be started from an exogenous increase in

external import prices (see the bottom part of the chart). Domestic import
prices, which are also determined by changes in the exchange rate, affected

the price-wage-price system and led to an output reduction. The latter was
exacerbated by an accompanying demand shock largely caused by a contraction

in the world market. Countries differed in their response because of
differences in three inaor areas: the nature of the price-wage linkages,
the effects on the current-account balance and the closely related monetary

policy and exchange rate response. The latter accounts for a substantial
part of intercountry differences in inflation rates.

19 No separation into intermediate and final imports is shown here nor is

the link from the domestic price level shown.
20 The link from the current account to the exchange rate has not yet been

modelled in our empirical study. This has so far been confined to the
case of perfect capital mobility.

may still obscure

the most important issues. The feeling of not being able to see the wood
for the trees may intensify as we proceed, in the next section, to discuss

a quantitative simulation model. One may-sometimes get a nutshell
description of what has been happening even with the aid of one curve and
a very small reduced-form model, albeit at the cost of considerable

oversimplification. Before we plunge into detail let us therefore consider
a summary figure with a familiar pair of axes--average inflation rates
and rates of deviation of manufacturing

output from capacity growth.

Figure 4 traces the main average developments for six major OECD countries,

excluding the United States2' (Canada, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, and

the United Kingdom). As is well
like a reasonably well-behaved

known, the poj.nts followed what looked

Phillips curve in the 1960s; the plot

starts curving back in 1969, with a fairly flat upward drift in both

inflation and output deviation. From 1972-73 on one obtains the perverse
bell-shaped curve, which is familiar from the experience of so many
countries.22
21

very similar general

pattern.

figure drawn only up to 1976, with an arrow (and a question mark) pointing

in a clear southwest direction signifying the hoped-for move "towards

price stability and full employment." Subsequent developments in 1977
and 1978 have not exactly fulfilled that promise.

The price equation can he derived from a straightforward priceadjustment relationship with price expectations and a wage-adjustment
equation built into It.2k The output equation is based on the

output-adjustment relation involving both the negative import cost-push25
and the various demand—pull elements (fiscal and monetary policy, export

demand). The model is highly simplified and suffers from some obvious
statistical deficiencies (one serious problem is that of pooling different

countriest observations into one regression).26 However, it does give
quite good tracking of the curve in Figure 4.

2L+ The above pair of equations was selected frbm a preliminary empirical

study (Bruno, 1979) in which a number of alternative equations were

estimated for prices, output, wages, and the exchange rate. When a
money-determined exchange-rate equation is substituted for the exchange
rate in the price equation during the floating period (after 1972), the

end results are similar. An attempt to put in separate
demand elements (Z) into the price equation failed. Even money by
itself is barely significant. Its main role after 1972 seems to come
via the exchange rate effect on import prices.
25 Real wages came out negative but statistically nonsignificant and were

therefore deleted from the equation.
26 The study attempts to deal with this by introducing dummy intercepts or,

in some cases, allowing for different slopes.. The best alternative,
which we have followed here, is to look in greater detail into the
experience of individual countries.

It can be seen from the output equation that a change in the relative

(p1/p) of the order of 30-40 per cent as in 1973-74 induces a
5-7 per cent drop in q. This accounts for between 40 and 60 per cent of

world

demand and domestic fiscal and monetary restraint

making up varying

amounts of the rest. The rise in the relative price of at least •one major
input, energy, has not been reversed since 1974. This explains, at least

partly, that while inflation rates were back t pre-1973 levels by 1978,
considerable unemployment remains in the system. It is a 'real' structural
phenomenon, not one that can be explained, or

cured, by purely monetary

or even fiscal means. In Section III we present a more detailed quantitative
attempt to trace the dynamics of a macro system under alternative external

shocks. But before that we have to extend the analysis to the many-country
case.

THE INDUSTRIAL WORLD AND MULTI-COUNTRY INTERACTIONS

Once we move from a single economy to the whole industrial world neither
the world price, level nor world income can be assumed to remain exogenous.

Countries can no longer be assumed to determine their ternis of trade and

real incomes independently of each other. In what sense then, if at all,
can one aggregate the effects of exogenous shocks across countries?
Before considering multi-country interactions it is helpful to discuss
a highly abstract model in which the whole industrial world is aggregated

into one consolidated economy producing a single final good q at price p,
and trading with a single 'OPEC' hich is assumed to command sufficient

monopoly power29 to determine the relative price (n =

p

-

p) of its only

export, the intermediate good.3°

Since there is no distinction between

domestic and traded final goods

the real product wage (w - p) is now the same as the real consumption wage

w and theworld

final-goods supply schedule can be represented as a

function of the real wage (we), the relative intermediate goods price (Tr)

and the exogenous capital stock (k).3' If OPEC can fix

29 This assumption is crucial for what follows, and it seems to be realistic
as far as oil prices are concerned.

wage is rigid, aggregate supply is unambiguously determined. The aggregate
supply curve can be drawn as a vertical line in a price-quantity diagram

(see curve S in Figure 5). Note that it is the absolute world price
level that now appears on the vertical axis.

To obtain an aggregate demand curve we follow logic similar to
that

applied earlier to the single country case, but, with some

modifications, Instead of taking the real world interest ratc(R) as
given in the investment function we can write R =

-e

where i

is

the nominal interest rate and e are inflationary expectations. Next
we solve for the nominal interest rate by appealing to a money-market

equilibrium condition.32 After substituting in the investment function and
using a Keynesian aggregate demand framework the quantity demanded
can finally be written as a negative function of real import prices (Tin) and

the real wage (we) and as a positive function f the various demand shifting

Consider now an exogenous increase in the relative import price
Ttn'

The supply curve shifts leftward from S to S', while the demand curve

will most probably also shift to the left (from D to D'). The extent
of the shift depends on the real wage response, as before. The equilibrium

point will move from A (q, p) to B (q, p).

32 This can be written in the form m p =

A similar closed-economy framework was recently used by Phelps (1978)

There are a number of important points to note. Consider first the
unambiguous contractionary effect on output which is wholly supply-

determined, given real wage rigidity. The effect on the price level is
more ambiguous since it depends on the relative strength of the impact

effect on real income and demand as against its effect on supply.3
With

the

new equilibrium at B, what will happen if an attempt is

made to boost demand? An accomodating monetary policy can be represented

as an increase in m shifting the demand curve back to D. All that would
happen in this case is a further rise in the price level to the full amount

of the increase in the money supply (see the move from B to E in
Figure 5, with prices rising to p). Fiscal policy (Z) will likewise
raise interest rates and force up prices by a crowding-out process. Finally,
greater recycling of OPEC surpluses can here be represented by an increase
in x, again with no expansionary effect on out'j)ut. If the industrial

world is on its supply schedule, an increase in output can come about oniy
as a result of a fall in real wages or a rise in the capital stock.
Is this a realistic description of the main factors underlying the

recent world recession? Let us repeat two qualifications. First, note
that to the extent that there is nominal wage rigidity monetary policy may
cause real wages to fall, through a price rise, and thus have an expansionary

effect. The second, more important, point is that there could be a
Keynesian recession on top of a classical one. Suppose, for example, that

the two real wage levels are downward rigid. Suppose the original world
equilibrium was at point A on the curve TS (for determination of the

the second country now attempts to regain its previous output level (q)

by boosting its domestic demand. Quite independently of any balance of
payments problems (to which we turn later) this can only take place at the
expense of the first country's output since a gain in one country's terms
of trade must be the other country's loss (shift from A' to B in Figure 6).
This highly simplified argument again shows the fundamental difference
between a supply shock which affects the structure of the industrial world
and between demand shifts which, except for temporary Keynesian Situations,

can ultimately be no more than beggar-my-neighbour cures. Given the rise

Is there any point in co-ordinated world expansion except to prevent
beggar_niy_neiglibour results? Again the answer is that when a supply shock

is accompanied by demand contraction, the system may well find itself,

temporarily, in a Keynesian unemployment situation. It terms of Figure 6,
this would be represented by a point such as C inside IS'. Expansionary
policy may then increase output in one economy without necessarily causing
a contraction in the rest of the world (see the movement from C to

13

in Figure 5). One reason why this may very well require co-ordinated
expansion has to do with the current-account

implications of confiningan

expansion to one country while the other remains stagnant. We shall turn

fl]ULATICIv MODEL AND EM?1RIC.4L ANALYSIS

The graphical analysis of Section I is based on the detailed model in MEA.
In

this part of the

model.

First, the

'representative'

paper we discuss the empirical relevance of the same

model's parameter values are selected to describe a

OECD economy. The

response of this economy to a doubling

of oil prices is studied under a variety of assumptions about labour

market dynamics. A second economy is then added and we illustrate how
multi-country interactions affect our numerical estimates. Throughout this
section, we also appeal to the country data to support the general structure
of the simulation model (for further empirical results, see Saclis, 1979).

The simulations convey a clear message: fuel inputs are sufficiently
important in production, and the 1973 oil pricE rise was of such magnitude
that a large part of the 1974-75 recession is directly attributable to the

change in the relative of oil. While monetary policy was contractionary
in most countries in 1974, the simulations suggest that even with

accommodative policy the 1974-75 recession would have been severe, with
significant classical unemployment.

The dynamic response and

long-run

behaviour of the economy after ar

OPEC-like disturbance are shown to depend heavily on the behaviour of

wages, both nominal and real, For our small representative economy, with
world prices and income given, a fall of I per cent in the long-run real

wage increases employment by 0.65 per cent. The approximate doubling of
the real price of oil in 1973 is calculated to require a 6.4 per cent
decline in

real

wages to maintain employment in the home economy. In the

-35.

+

two-country

+

setting, the wage effect is even more powerful. When real

wages fall by 1 per cent in both countries, output in each increases

by

2.3 per cent. The doubling of oil prices requires a 3.5 per cent decline
in real wages in both countries for full employment to be restored.

In Section I, we suested that

an economy's response to external

shocks is influenced by a few key structural characteristics. For example,
the more dependent the economy is on net fuel imports, the more

aggregate demand declinesafter an oil price increase. In drawing lessons
from the representative

economy, it is important to keep in mind how

individual OECD economies differ from the average case. In addition to
the price simulation model, then, we describe in this section key structural

differences between the OECD economies that may explain some of the variety
of macro-economic experience in the past six years.
The Representative Economy:

Aggregate Supply

In this part, parameter values are assigned to the theoretical model. On
the supply side, domestic final goods are produced with labour, intermediate

inputs, and fixed capital. For the empirical simulations, we treat fuel
as the only intermediate input. A two-level

production process is specified.

Capital and labour combine to produce value added; in turn, value added
and fuel are used to produce the final

output: q q[v(, k), n]. For

concreteness, the value-added relation, V, and gross output, q, are described
as constant.elastjcity_of.5ubstjtution functions of their respective
arguments (see note 38).
The role of oil prices in

aggregate supply determination depends on

the extent to which labour and fuel can substitute for the fixed factor k.

+

Suppose, for instance, that capital and energy are used in fixed proportion;

while capital and labour are partially substitutable. Then oil is also a
fixed factor, tied to capital. The cost of a marginal unit of output is
just the labour cost, since fuel and capital costs are fixed; fuel prices

do not enter marginal cost. Alternatively, suppose that oil is used in
fixed proportion to output. The share of fuel costs in the marginal unit
of output is then equal to the share of fuel costs in the average unit of

output, i.e., the share of total fuel costs in total revenue. In general,

the less substitutable is n for k relative to the substitutability of
2 for k, the smaller is the effect of fuel prices on marginal cost)8
Most empirical evidence suggests a low short-run elasticity of

substitution of capital and energy, 0k' and a somewhat higher elasticity
The technical argument is as follows, For a two-level CES production
function we write final output Q as a CIS function of value added, V,

N. In turn V is produced according to a

assume that energy is used in fixed proportion to output, while value added
is a Cobb-Douglas function, i.e., labour and capital have constant shares.
We relax the first assumption, allowing a 1 per cent increase in the real
price of energy to decrease the energy—output ratio by 0.2 per cent. We
keep the assumption of a constant equilibrium share of labour in value
added.

The aggregate production technology is fully specified by selecting
initial factor shares for labour, energy, and capital. For the

representative economy, the labour share in value added is put at 0.69,

and the capital share at 0.31. At initial equilibrium, the marginal
efficiency of capital is set at 0.1 per cent (Feldstein and Summers, 1977,

calculated VIaK = 0.11

value added is then equal to 0.31/0.1 =

The net input of energy is measured as the sum of net imports of energy

To this is added domestic

production (from U.N., World Energy Supplies 1977) valued at world

output by 0.65 per cent, and a 1 per cent increase in fuel use raises output

by 0.05 per cent. Equation (2) is the price equation for a profitmaximizing firm.

Factor prices are extremely important in determining

the output price. Wage costs are almost fully passed through: with our
assumptions, a 1 per cent increase in nominal wages causes a 0.95 per cent

increase in output prices. About 5 per cent of a fuel price increase shows

up in the final-goods price.' The level of output also affects p.
Because the capital stock is fixed, marginal costs increase with output,:

This equation describes output as a decreasing function of real factor

prices), a 1 per cent increase in the relative price of oil causes

aggregate supply to fall by 0.12. Let us now introduce the (log) consumer

42Econometric studies find a significant effect of energy prices on final-

hand, positive output effects on prices have not been as clearly
the
dcnionstrated (see
discussion in Mork, l978b, p. Il). In our own

econometric

work, reported in Sachs (1979), we find that a fixed-markup

e4uation, i.e., one without output effects, does not describe the

1974-75 price behaviour adequately. In a markup price equation a dummy
variable for 1974-75 is consistently negative. This suggests that the
recession did in fact lower markups, as equation (2) predicts.

Sections

positing

a wage-determination

I and II that the response of wages to

the oil shock is crucial for the dynaniic adjustment of output. Real wages

must fall after a supply shock for full employment to he maintained. To
the

extent that nominal wages adjust slowly to price movements, part of

that real wage decline can be effected through expansionary monetary policy.
To the

extent that wages are indexed, so that real wages adjust slowly

while nominal wages are flexible, monetary adjustments lead only to

compensating price movements, without affecting real output. Indeed, if
real rather than nominal wages are rigid, a sustained period of unemployment
might be necessary to restore equilibrium wage levels after a. supply

disturbance (see also Bruno, 1978).
Many writers have speculated as to whethr actual wage processes are
more accurately described by wages following past wages (wage-wage process)

or current price expectations (wage-price process). The wage-wage process
corresponds to nornina7

rigidity

in that the real wage can be affected by

anticipated monetary policy. We speculate that the wage-wage process results
in large part frbm the existence of overlapping long-term contracts in the

labour market.43 Until the mid-1970s, aggregate real wage growth was so
constant that the two hypotheses could not be econometrically distinguished.

The increased variability in real wages since 1973 allows a partial answer tO
the question. Indeed, the evidence suggests that different, countries have
significantly different degrees of nominal rigidity.
See Taylor (1978).

It will be shown later that of the large OECD economies,

only the United States and Canada exhibit a wage-wage process. Only in
these two countries is there widespread use of overlapping long-term
labour agreements with relatively little indexing.

more sharply in Japan. The acceleration occurred in spite of a massive supply
shock, high unemployment, and adverse productivity changes. After about
eighteen months of recession, wages began to decelerate in the four countrie.;

in 1976, and continued to do so in 1977. The first notable point is that reil
wage growth declines slowly in response to excess supply in the labour market.
Econometric evidence allows us to measure the real wage response to

unemployment and price changes. Phillips curve regressions are shown in

Table 2."' Canada and the United States display an aggregate wage
determination process that is distinct from the others. In these two
countries wage inflation is essentially unaffected by the level of lagged
unemployment, for given rates of past wage change and expected inflation.

Both countries also display a combined wage-wage, wage-price process. For
the other five economies, lagged unemployment has a significant depressing

effect on current nominal wage change. Equally important, a

is small

(even negative) and is not statistically significant for the other five

economies, so that lagged wane inflation affects current wage change only

through its impact on expected price inflation. The estimates of
suggest that the oil shock may have had a direct effect on Japanese and
Italian wages, which did not operate through unemployment or price
inflation.

Aggregate Demand and Investment Behaviour
We complete the simulation model

by specifying the determinants of aggregate
demand. Since the demand side is less novel than the supply side, we
proceed quickly.
Aggregate consumption and final-goods imports are functions of disposabie

income and the final-goods terms of trade. It is assumed that total
household absorption is equal to 90 per cent of disposable income. The
division of household expenditure between

imports, Cm) and domestic goods,

c, is assumed to depend on relative prices. A 1 per cent increase in
world prices relative to domestic prices is assumed, in the long
run, to

cause a 0.8 peient decline in the ratio of imported to domestic goods
in the consumer basket.

Export demand is made a unit-elastic function of

world income and the ternis of trade.

The investment demand equation is important in view of the central role

- 46

of declining investment in

theoretically

the

-

1974-75 downturn. Unfortunately, a

sound investment equation requires a long-run model, with

explicit paths of capital accumulation and equity prices (see Blanchard,
1978). A less rigorous formulation is to write inv.stment as a. function

of

the ratio of th current marginal product of capital to

the current

long-term cost of capital. If we can assume perfect capital nobility,
the

domestic long-term cost of capital is given approximately by the world

The simulation model is closed by specifying the asset demand
structure and the process of expectations formation.

For the simulations,

we assume a pegged though adjustable exchange rate. Assuming perfect
capital mobility, the domestic short-term nominal interest rate is equal
to the world level, as long as there is no expectation of devaluation. In
our theoretical work, we spell out the dynamics of a freely floating
exchange rate, which can easily be simulated.

again in 1979). Other primary

displayed a more dramatic boom and bust, rising sharply in 1973-74,

and then falling sharply in 1975, with the onset of the world recession.
Our simulation considers a permanent doubling of world energy prices,
although the rise in all the other prices contributed to the world
stagflation, and their fall, no doubt aided the partial world recovery.

For our representative economy, the oil price rise requires a 6.4

per cent decline in real wages for full employment to be restored. Even
with long-run inelastic labour supply, output falls 0.8 per cent, because

of substitution away from energy inputs. If the labour supply is perfectly
elastic, with real wages fixed at' their pre-shock level, output declines

by 4.5 per cent. Because the model is linear, we conclude that each 1
per cent fall in real wages boosts domestic output by 0.58 per cent.

The detailed discussion of short-run dynamics is postponed untilthe

two-country case. Here, we make some general observations about dynamic
adjustment. The wage determination process is important for the short-run
response of the economy to the price-hike. In the model, the oil price
rise is calculated to cause a one-year blip in the consumer price index

of about 1.5 per cent. Real wages fall in the year of the Price rise,
because (a) the blip is unexpected

and (b) wages follow lagged wages

Simulation Resu its for the 2o-Country Model
In Section II, we described how an import price shock can shift a manycountry aggregate supply frontier. Following a suggestion of Fair (1979.)
it is easy to illustrate the interactions between countries with our simulation
model.

We link the industrial economy to a mirror image1 making the

exports of one equal to the imports of the other. Various experiments are
then performed by changing the structural labour market characteristics
in one of the countries. In this model, we assume that the two industrial
countries import oil from OPEC, which export oil but not industrial goods.

At this point, OPEC consumption behaviour is not modelled; we assume for
simplicity that oil revenues are saved in the short run (no new theoretical
issues are raised by including OPEC spending on industrial exports).
For two identical economies, the effect of a real oil price shock is

easily adduced. Assume that the price of oil doubles in terms of a basket
of the two countries' final goods, with each final good having equal weight

in the basket. We again appeal to the aggregate supply relation (5).
Since the countries are mirror images, the terms of trade, p

remain unchanged, by symmetry. Also, w - PC

An 8.3 per cent decline in output might seem rather large. Of course,

at this point real wages have n,t been allowed to decline at all in reaction

to the jump in unemployment. Each subsequent fall of 1 per cent in the
real wage in both countries produces a 2.3 per cent increase in output.
Real wages must decline at least 3.5 per cent in each country for full
employment to he restored.

What happens to the

path? Simply, k

world

real rate of interest along the adjustment

falls if the global aggregate demand effect exceeds

the aggregate supply effect just measured, as would be the case for the

real interest rate in a closed-economy model. Given our

assumptions,

the deflationary demand effect of the oil shock dominates after the first

year. Real interest rates jump 40 basis points in the year of the shock,
and then fall 120 basis points in the two succeeding years. Very modest
support for this effect is offered by the nieastires of the U.S. long-run

real interest rates in

Feldstein

and Summers (1978). They find that the

long-term U.S. corporate bond rate minus the rate of long-term expected
inflation fell from an average of 4.1 per cent for 1966-73, to 2.6 per cent
for 1974-76, after the oil shock.

When the economies have different fiscal policies, different rates
of domestic energy production, or different patterns of real wage change1
the final-goods terms of trade vary during the adjustment path. Consider
the case where the home country has rapid real-wage adjustment and inelastic
labour supply, while the foreign country has slower wage adjustment and

long-run labour supply inelasticity.8 The effect of the oil shock is

'Ihe initial 8.3 per cent output decline is the

same in both countries. At home, w - PC

falls more rapidly and output

expands more quickly. Since long-run w - PC

is lower at home, long-run

output is higher.

The following results, easily established analytically, are suggested:

1. A real wage decline in one country causes real income to rise in both
countries.

2. A long-run real wage increase in one country lowers real wages in the
other. '

3.

The economy with the larger real wage decline, ceteris paribus,

experiences a

trade surplus; the other economy, of course, has an

equal and opposite deficit.

A fourth proposition, not evident from the table is:
4. The economy with greater domestic produc"tion of oil experiences a
smaller decline in output than does the other.
Flow does the simulation estimate of an 8.3 per cent impact effect on

output compare with actual magnitudes of output decline in the industrial

economies? Table 7 gives a very rough measure. Actually, the 8.3 per
cent is a mid-range estimate of the decline of GNP relative to trend for

the four countries. One interesting source of intercountry variation is

Canada. The recession in Canada is late and relativ.ly small. This is no
doubt a reflection of our proposition 4: Canada is a net exporter of

When both countries have long-run labour supply inelasticity, real wages

must decline by 3.5 per cent to restore full employment. Now the
country with inelastic labour supply experiences a 5.0 per cent wage
decline, because real wages fail to drop significantly in the other
economy.

As a final experiment, consider the case of Hxcd exchange rates and

sticky nominal wages. The oil shock has a less contractionary impact effect
than is reported above. Assume a given world stock of money and Cambridge
d
money demand functions in each country of the form M = PQ

0.2
,

where

0.2 is the assumed short-run income elasticity of demand for money. The
decline in output that follows the oil shock will cause prices to rise.
With two identical countries, each 1 per cent decline in income leads to

a 0.2 per cent rise in prices. The unexpected rise in prices following
an oil price increase will reduce real wages in the short-run, as in the

one-country model. When short-run indexation (see note 47) is 0.5, a
doubling of oil prices causes a 1.4 per cent unexpected spurt in prices.
Real wages are reduced by 0.5 X 1.4% = 0.7% in the first period.
Consequently, the output decline is reduced from 8.3 to 6.7 per cent in
the first year.

CONCLUDING i?LMAI?]W

This

may be an opportune moment to suggest directions for further research.

Theoretical models of open economies must be extended to allow for both
classical and Keyflesia11unem)loyment, whose relative importance has been a

general issue in our paper. Econometric work might be used to determine
more precisely how much of the 'great recession' was in fact classical or
Keynesian. New statistical techniques for markets in disequilibrium offer

tools for careful empirical research in this direction.

Our simulation did not address the sharp temporary rise in non-fuel
commodity prices in 1972-73, though that temporary shock raises important
questions. Its additional effect on to!) of (and preceding) the oil price

rise was to deepen the stagflation of the mid-l970s. Once world output fell
and excess supply of those commodities forced their price down, the effect
on domestic final-goods markets would imply a rightward shift of the supply
curve. With domestic prices rigid downward, a ratchet effect may have
developed, turning a temporary supply shock into more permanent Keynesian
unemployment.

Next we note the pc!ar view of exchange rates as either determined by
perfect capitai mobiiity or fixed. The role of the current account and
imperfect capital mobility, along the lines recently modelled by Kouri
(l978b), should be explicitly incorporated into the system.

On the basis of the preliminary

comparative country estimates given

here, especially with respect to labour market behaviour, it can be seen that
there is room for considerable additional analysis of the differences in

patterns of institutional behaviour and policy responses between countries.
Let us stress again that this paper has explicitly confined itself to

-62-

+

short-run

+

aspects of economic developments. One central long-run issue is

that of capital accumulation. For a full analysis of a supply shock,
explicit account irust be taken of the repe:'cuss.ons cn long-run capacity

and growth levels. It seems very likely that OECD countries have not only
suffered a short-term set-back but are now on a !ower long-run growth path
although oil alone cannot explain that.

As a final long-run issue with short-term nolicy implications one
should mention a development which has become

important in

the 1970s. We have in mind the internal structural implications for. the

highly industrialized economies of the rapid growth of manufacturing
exports by semi-industrialized LDCs. These have been completely ignored in
the present paper although for. some OECD countries, this is gradually

becoming a major issue. In at least one respect, however, the analysis of

this quesion would fall quite naturally into the general approach that we
would like to advocate. Short-term price and output adjustments and real
structural changes may be very hard t- keep apart..
