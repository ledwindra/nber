Limited Capital Market Participation and Human Capital Risk
Jonathan Berk and Johan Walden
NBER Working Paper No. 15709
January 2010
JEL No. G11,G12,J24
ABSTRACT
The non-tradability of human capital is often cited for the failure of traditional asset pricing theory
to explain agents' portfolio holdings. In this paper we argue that the opposite might be true --- traditional
models might not be able to explain agent portfolio holdings because they do not explicitly account
for the fact that human capital does trade (in the form of labor contracts). We derive wages endogenously
as part of a dynamic equilibrium in a production economy. Risk is shared in labor markets because
firms write bilateral labor contracts that insure workers, allowing agents to achieve a Pareto optimal
allocation even when the span of asset markets is restricted to just stocks and bonds. Capital markets
facilitate this risk sharing because it is there that firms offload the labor market risk they assumed from
workers. In effect, by investing in capital markets investors provide insurance to wage earners who
then optimally choose not to participate in capital markets. The model can produce some of the most
important stylized facts in asset pricing: (1) limited asset market participation, (2) the seemingly high
equity risk premium, (3) the very large disparity in the volatility of consumption and the volatility
of asset prices, and (4) the time dependent correlation between consumption growth and asset returns.

A commonly held view amongst financial economists is that a significant fraction of wealth
consists of non-tradable assets, most notably human capital wealth. Indeed, this hypothesis
is often used to explain why one of the key predictions of the CAPM does not hold, that all
agents hold the same portfolio of risky assets. Because investors should use the capital markets
to diversify as much risk as possible, and because non-tradable human capital exposure varies
across individuals, investors should optimally choose to hold different portfolios of risky assets.
Although this explanation certainly has the potential to explain the cross sectional variation
in portfolio holdings, it also necessarily implies wide stock market participation. However, the
fact is that the majority of people do not participate in the capital markets. Not only do these
individuals appear to eschew the opportunity to partially hedge their human capital exposure,
the hedging of human capital risk does not appear to be a primary motivator for the minority
of people who do participate in capital markets. Instead, the anecdotal evidence suggests that
rather than a desire to hedge, what motivates most investors is a willingness take on additional
risk because they find the risk return tradeoff attractive.1 The object of this paper is to put
forward a plausible explanation for these two characteristics of investor behavior.
The most commonly cited explanation for why most people do not participate in capital
markets is barriers to entry, although in economies such as the United States it is difficult to
accept that significant economic barriers to entry exist that prevent people from participating.
Instead, most researchers cite educational barriers to entry because research has shown that education level is strongly correlated with participation.2 But the problem with this explanation
for limited stock market participation is that it does not address the question of why the educational barriers exist at all. After all, we see wide participation in arguably more complicated
financial products such as mortgages, auto leases and insurance. In these cases the educational
barriers to entry were removed by the motivation to make profits — firms invested considerable
resources in educating people so they could sell these products. Given the welfare gain to hedging non-tradable human capital, why does a similar economic motivation to educate consumers
to hold stocks apparently not exist?
Market incompleteness may potentially offer an explanation for limited stock market participation. For instance, the asset span might be so “narrow” that the stock market offers little
opportunity for Pareto improving trades. Although rarely cited explicitly, this explanation is
implicit in the literature on non-traded wealth. But, for this explanation to hold water, one
must also then account for why the asset span does not endogenously expand. In fact, the
span of traded assets has changed only marginally in recent years, despite the explosion in the
number of new assets. More importantly, one would not naturally expect incompleteness to
result in non-participation. Indeed, the low correlation between human capital and stock mar1

For example, considerable resources are devoted to advising people on how to find high return investments
whereas advice on investments with good hedging characteristics is largely non-existent.

ket returns documented in Lustig and Van Nieuwerburgh (2008) would suggest that despite the
incompleteness, the stock market offers diversification benefits which would imply wide participation. Thus, market incompletness appears to be an unlikely explanation for limited stock
market participation.
If frictions, like barriers to entry and market incompleteness, are not preventing agents from
participating, then they must be choosing not to participate. One possibility is that agents’
initial endowments are naturally so close to a Pareto optimal allocation that there is little
reason to engage in further trade. But considering the heterogeneity in actual endowments,
this explanation seems implausible. A more plausible possibility is that some agents are able to
achieve their Pareto optimal allocation through trade in other markets and therefore trading in
stock markets provides no incremental benefit.
In this paper, we argue that what traditional models of investment ignore are other markets
on which people share risk. Building on this insight, we identify the labor market as one
such market and posit that the unwillingness of some individuals to use capital markets is a
consequence of the fact that they are able to share enough risk through their wage contracts
so that the capital markets offer little incremental benefit. A Pareto optimal allocation can
therefore be achieved even with the “narrow” asset span we observe in actual stock markets
implying that limited stock market participation is an efficient equilibrium outcome.
We focus on labor markets because they are an ideal place to share risk. The structure of
most firms has historically been built around long-term tailored labor contracts between the firm
and its workers. Indeed, viewed this way, one might wonder why all risk cannot be optimally
shared in labor markets. The reason is that long-term labor contracts are not necessarily efficient
for all employees — some employees are better off retaining the flexibility to switch jobs. Because
of this labor market mobility, to achieve efficient risk sharing, asset markets are also required.
Our results call into question one of the basic assumptions in asset pricing — that because
asset markets do not span labor risk, human capital is not traded and so most wealth is nontradable. In our equilibrium, the labor market has an important role in sharing risk, effectively
allowing firms to insure workers. That implies that the owners of the firm are the ultimate
insurers of this human capital risk. Consequently, shareholders must be compensated for taking
on this additional risk, so the risk premium for holding equity is considerably higher than the
risk premium for holding pure consumption risk. Indeed, by parameterizing our model we are
able to show that it is not difficult to reproduce the observed level of the equity risk premium
with realistic values of risk aversion, the risk free rate, consumption growth and consumption
volatility.
By recognizing the important role of labor contracts in the riskiness of equity, we demonstrate
why, in an otherwise standard neoclassical model of asset prices, the volatility of equity prices
might bear little apparent relation to the volatility of consumption. One of the most important
empirical facts that the standard neoclassical model of asset prices appears to be unable to

2

explain is the seeming disconnect between the volatility of consumption and asset prices. Not
only is consumption volatility significantly lower than the volatility of asset prices, but the
two series behave manifestly differently. For example, average quarterly volatility of the S&P
500 index is 68% higher during recessions (as identified by the NBER).3 Yet, the concomitant
increase in consumption volatility is much smaller if it exists at all — over the period 1947-2009,
the point estimate of the volatility of (seasonally adjusted) quarterly GDP growth in NBER
recessions is only 11% higher than in expansions.4 As we will show, for a reasonable choice of
parameter values, our model can quantitatively match this stylized fact. We can also explain
a related empirical finding: that equity wealth is considerably more volatile and human capital
wealth is less volatile than total wealth.5 Because human capital wealth is traditionally measured
using wage income, that is, the income that results once risk sharing has already taken place in
the labor market, traditional measures underestimate the volatility of human capital wealth.
Finally, the model implies a time varying (and a low unconditional) correlation between
consumption growth and equity returns in line with what has been observed empirically. For
example, Duffee (2005) shows that the conditional correlation between consumption growth and
equity returns is almost zero when the equity wealth-to-consumption ratio is low, whereas the
correlation is high when the equity wealth-to-consumption ratio is high. This is exactly what our
model predicts and, further, it suggests that the degree of heterogeneity in labor productivity
should be a powerful instrument in a conditional asset pricing test. Our model also implies a
low unconditional correlation between labor income and equity returns, in line with Fama and
Schwert (1977).
The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we provide a brief literature review.
In sections 2-4 we introduce the model and derive several theoretical implications. Section 5
provides a simple calibration to realistic parameters, and section 6 makes some concluding
remarks. All proofs are left to the appendix.

Background

The idea that one role of the firm is to insure its workers’ human capital risk dates at least
as far back as Knight (1921). Knight takes as a primitive that the job of worker and manager
entails taking on different risks and notes that entrepreneurs bear most of the risk. Using
this idea Kihlstrom and Laffont (1979) endogenizes who, in a general equilibrium, becomes an
entrepreneur and who becomes a worker. Less risk averse agents choose to be entrepreneurs
who then optimally insure workers. However, the wage contract in that paper is exogenously
3

It is 21.4% in recessions and 12.7% at other times. Quarterly volatility is defined to be the standard deviation
of daily returns of the S&P 500 index over the quarter over the period 1962-2009. This difference is highly
statistically significant.
4
Using quarterly data published by the BEA, the volatility of GDP growth in recessions is 4.66% while is is
4.19% at other times over the 1947-2009 time period.

imposed rather than an endogenous response to the desire to optimally share risk and so the
resulting equilibrium is not Pareto efficient.
The papers that first recognized the importance of endogenizing the wage contract, and
therefore the ones most closely related to our paper, are Dreze (1989) and Danthine and Donaldson (2002). Like us, Dreze (1989) considers the interaction between a labor and capital
market in general equilibrium and focuses on efficient risk sharing. Our point of departure is
how we model production — Dreze does not consider the implication of productive heterogeneity. Consequently, there is no natural reason (beyond differences in risk aversion and wealth)
for some workers to insure other workers in Dreze’s model. Hence, the model does not explain
limited capital market participation or focus on the return to bear labor risk.
Danthine and Donaldson (2002), like us, explicitly model both labor and financial markets
with agent heterogeneity. Their model features investors and workers, but, importantly, Danthine and Donaldson (2002) do not allow workers to invest or investors to work. In that model
investors are endowed with wealth rather than productivity and hence have a precautionary
reason to save which they do by investing in firms. Because this motive is missing in our model,
prices must adjust to induce some workers to invest. This is a key difference between the two
models and is responsible for the stark differences in some of the models’ implications. Because
workers have to be induced, in our model, to take on the additional risks of equity, we get a large
equity premium while the equity risk premium in Danthine and Donaldson (2002) is small.6
Our paper also contributes to the large literature, that started with Mayers (1972), studying
the effect of non-tradable wealth in financial markets. The main results in that literature are that
investors should no longer hold the same portfolio of risky assets and the single factor pricing
relation must be adjusted. Although Fama and Schwert (1977) finds little evidence supporting
Mayer’s model, both Campbell (1996) and Jagannathan and Wang (1997) find that adding a
measure of human capital risk significantly increases the explanatory power of the CAPM. Santos
and Veronesi (2006) find that the labor income to consumption ratio has predictive power for
stock returns and can help explain risk premia in the cross section. Because wage contracts
provide insurance for human capital risk, our model implies that wages (the typical measure of
human capital used in the literature) should have explanatory power for stock returns.
Because most of the theoretical predictions of the neoclassical asset pricing model rely on
effectively complete markets, initially researchers were tempted to attribute the failure of those
models to market incompleteness. However, Telmer (1993) and Heaton and Lucas (1996) convincingly argue that market incompleteness cannot account for important puzzles such as the
apparently high equity risk premium. As we show in this paper, quite the opposite intuition
might be true. The failure of the models might stem from the fact that agents actually share risk
more completely than is supposed in the literature. If labor markets effectively share risk, then
6

Danthine and Donaldson (2002) can only get a large premium by introducing market frictions that restrict
risk sharing.

4

because equity holders are the ultimate insurers of human capital risk, they will demand a high
risk premium. As we will demonstrate, our results are consistent with the findings in Mankiw
and Zeldes (1991) and Brav, Constantinides, and Geczy (2002) in that those who choose not
to participate are less wealthy, less educated and more reliant on wage income as their source
of wealth. Furthermore, consistent with the anecdotal evidence, the primary motivation for
investing in capital markets is the attractive risk return tradeoff offered, not a desire to hedge
human capital risk.

Model

Like any source of risk, human capital risk has both an idiosyncratic component and a systematic
component. Although the idiosyncratic component is likely to be large, especially early in a
person’s career, we will focus exclusively on the systematic component because we are interested
in the implications of how agents share risk in the economy. Idiosyncratic risk, by its very nature,
can be diversified away, so there is little reason for any agent to hold this risk in a complete
market equilibrium.
are well

Consequently, the risk sharing implications of sharing idiosyncratic risk

understood.7

Given our objective to study how systemic risk is shared in the economy, our model must
include heterogeneous agents. An important source of individual heterogeneity in the economy is
worker flexibility: Some workers only have access to a single production technology while others
can choose between production technologies. Building on this insight we model productivity
as follows. Our economy consists of a continuum of workers that produce a single, perishable,
consumption good. Workers produce goods using a productive technology that has a common
component and an individual component we term a worker’s production technology.
Formally, there is a closed set of production technologies (industries), P ⊂ [0, 1] × [0, K], for
some K > 0. Each inflexible agent only has access to a single production technology in this set,
(b, f ), and produces At (b + f s) of a consumption good, where At ≡ A0 ert is the non-stochastic8
part of production common to all agents, and s is a state variable that captures the current
state of the economy. Flexible agents have access to every production technology in P. The
production technology set has the properties that (0, K) ∈ P, (1, 0) ∈ P, (b, K) ∈ P ⇒ b = 0
and (1, f ) ∈ P ⇒ f = 0.
The dynamics of At are meant to capture overall economic growth and allows us to model
7

Although it’s not the focus of the paper, Harris and Holmström (1982) makes it clear how agents share
idiosyncratic labor risk. The paper shows that most, but not all, of this risk can be removed by the labor
contract. Under the optimal labor contract firms insure all agents against negative realizations of idiosyncratic
labor risk but agents remain exposed to some positive realizations. Of course, the owners of these firms do not
have to expose themselves to this labor risk because by holding a large portfolio of firms, they can diversify the
risk away.

It is straightforward to extend our analysis to allow stochastic growth in At , as long as innovations in At are
independent of innovations in s.

recessions as a relative drop in productivity. The stochastic process s is a diffusion process on
R+ that summarizes the state of the world:
ds = µ(s) dt + σ(s) dω.
We will model s as a mean-reverting square root process,
√
ds = θ(s − s) dt + σ s dω,

(1)

where the condition 2θs > σ 2 ensures positivity. The mean-reversion introduces a business cycle
interpretation and is useful for calibrations, although, as we shall see, much of the theory goes
through for general µ(s) and σ(s) so long as µ and σ are smooth, σ is strictly positive, and the
growth conditions |µ(s)| ≤ c1 (1 + s), σ(s) ≤ c2 (1 + s) are satisfied for finite constants, c1 and c2 .
It is natural to define a recession as states for which s < s, whereas an expansion is when s > s.
Let the inflexible agents be indexed by i ∈ I = [0, α], where 0 < α < 1, with agent i
working in industry (bi , fi ), where we assume that bi and fi are measurable functions that are
nondegenerate in the sense that it is neither the case that the full mass of agents work in industry
(0, K), nor in industry (1, 0). Then the total productivity of all inflexible agents in the economy
is
At KI (s) = A0 ert KI (s),
where

Z
KI (s) ≡

(bi + fi s)di = b̄ + f¯s.

(2)

i∈I

Note that 0 < b̄ < 1 and 0 < f¯ < K.
The rest of the agents in the economy are flexible agents, comprising mass 1 − α, i ∈ F =
(1 − α, 1]. Because these agents have access to any production technology in P and are free to
move between production technologies at any point in time, for a given s, it is optimal for them
to work in an industry (b∗ , f ∗ ), that solves
(b∗ , f ∗ ) = arg max b + f s,

(3)

(b,f )∈P

leading to the optimal productivity of flexible agents
At KF (s) = A0 ert KF (s)
where
KF (s) ≡ b∗ (s) + f ∗ (s)s.

(4)

Notice that, at any point in time, all flexible agents choose to work in industries that generate

6

the same output. Furthermore, we have

(a) KF (0) = 1,
(b) lims→∞

KF (s)
s

= K,

(c) KF (s) is a convex function of s.
We next assume that flexible agents can work part time in different industries, i.e., if (b1 , f1 ) ∈
P and (b2 , f2 ) ∈ P, then (λb1 + (1 − λ)b2 , λf1 + (1 − λ)f2 ) ∈ P for all λ ∈ [0, 1]. This implies
that for all b ∈ [0, 1] there is a (b, f ) ∈ P. Now, flexible agents will only consider production
def

technologies on the efficient frontier, (b, f (b)), where f (b) = max(b,f )∈P {f : (b, f ) ∈ P}, and it
follows immediately that f is a strictly decreasing, concave function defined on b ∈ [0, 1], such
that f (0) = K and f (1) = 0. Going forward, we make the additional technical assumptions that
f is strictly concave, twice continuously differentiable, and that f 0 (0) = 0, and f 0 (1) = −∞.
Under these assumptions it is easy to show that
Lemma 2 KF (s) is a twice continuously differentiable, strictly convex function, such that
KF0 (0) = 0 and lims→∞ KF0 (s) = K.
Lemma 2 ensures that KF (s) is a diffusion process (which is, of course, also true of KI (s)). The
total output in the economy at time t is:
At Ktot (st ) = A0 ert Ktot (st ),

(5)

Ktot (s) ≡ αKI (s) + (1 − α)KF (s),

(6)

where

implying that Ktot (s) is also a diffusion process.
Figure 1 plots a production function for a flexible and inflexible worker. When the two
workers work in the same industry they are equally productive. At all other times the flexible
agent will be more productive than the inflexible agent. The next lemma adds the additional
observation that the flexible worker’s mobility implies that flexible workers will move into safer
jobs in bad times and riskier jobs in good times so that flexible workers will have a natural
advantage in providing insurance to inflexible workers.

Workers and firms are organized as follows. A worker can choose either to work for himself
and produce the consumption good, or he can choose to “sell” his production to a firm and earn
a wage instead. Firms are specialized — they can only employ workers with a single production
technology. Consequently, if a flexible worker decides to switch production technologies, then
if she is working for a firm, she must quit her job and find a job in the industry she wishes
to switch into (or simply work for herself). The fact that firms are specialized and so workers

8

must switch employers in order to switch industries is a crucial assumption in our model that
we contend reflects reality.9
Workers are also owners — they are free to invest in firms through the capital markets and
consume any dividend payments. In equilibrium, markets must clear — all firms must attract
enough investment capital to fulfill their wage obligations.
Finally, we assume that all agents are infinitely lived, with constant relative risk-aversion
(CRRA), risk-aversion coefficient γ > 0, and expected utility of consumption

Throughout the paper, we assume an infinite horizon economy. In our numerical calcululations
we use a finite horizon set-up, where the horizon is large enough to get convergence to the
solution of the infinite horizon economy (i.e., the steady state solution). An advantage of this
approach is that it leads to a unique solution, allowing us to avoid the nontrivial issue of defining
transversality conditions to rule out bubble solutions in an economy with nonlinear dynamics.

Complete Markets Equilibrium

We begin by deriving the complete market Pareto optimal equilibrium and then explain how
this equilibrium can implemented. Because At Ktot maximizes total output, any Pareto optimal
equilibrium must have this output. Under the complete markets assumption a representative
agent with utility ur exists such that the solution to the representative agent problem is identical
to the solution of the multi-agent problem. Moreover, all agents have CRRA utility functions
with the same γ, so ur is also of the CRRA form, with the same γ. Thus, in a complete market
equilibrium, the value of any asset generating instantaneous consumption flow δ(st , t)dt, is

Any Pareto optimal equilibrium features perfect risk sharing — all agents’ consumption across
states have the same ordinal ranking. Moreover, because of the CRRA assumptions, it is well
known that a stronger result applies in our equilibrium — all agents’ ratio of consumption across
any two states is the same. In other words, every agent consumes the same fraction of total
output in every state:
cI (s, t) = η At Ktot (s) = η At (αKI (s) + (1 − α)KF (s))

(12)

cF (s, t) = (1 − η) At Ktot (s) = (1 − η) At (αKI (s) + (1 − α)KF (s))

(13)

where cI and cF if the aggregate consumption of all the inflexible and flexible agents respectively
and η is the fraction of the total output consumed by all the inflexible agents. Given that the
agents can trade their human capital, from the budget constraint at time 0 it follows that,

We can also view η as a function of the initial state, η(s0 ). The following properties of η follow

In words, because inflexible agents can never be less productive than flexible agents, the equilibrium fraction of consumption inflexible agents consume is bounded above by α, the fraction
of the economy they comprise. It is bounded below by the inflexible consumption in the state
that their share of productivity is minimized, that is either when s = 0 or ∞. Because inflexible
agents share of productivity is lower both for low and high values of the state variable, η has
10

def

an interior maximum. It therefore follows that if we define s∗ = min{arg maxs0 η(s0 )}, then
0 < s∗ < ∞. The wealth share of the inflexible agent is thus maximized at a finite value, s∗ ,
and we denote the wealth share at this point by η ∗ ≡ η(s∗ ). Finally, as the state variable goes
to infinity, both types of agents productivity converge to a linear function of the state variable
and, in addition, the value of insurance becomes negligible, so the equilibrium converges to one
with no risk sharing — each agent consumes what he produces.
To solve explicitly for the equilibrium requires computing the expectation in (11), which can
be done using standard techniques from dynamic programming:

we assume that A0 = 1 going forward, since all variables are homogeneous of degree zero or one
in A0 . All the numerical solutions in this paper were derived by solving (18).

Implementation

To gain insight into how actual markets, which are far from complete, share risk, it is important
that we model these markets realistically. Hence, we restrict agents’ and firms’ ability to write
and trade contracts in the following ways:
Restriction 1
(i) Binding contracts cannot be written directly between agents.
(ii) Firms may enter into binding contracts with agents subject to the following restrictions:
(1) Limited liability may not be violated. (2) Workers and equity holders cannot be required
to make payments,
(iii) Banks may enter into short term debt contracts with agents and firms, paying an interest
rate rs .
These restrictions reflect the practical limitations of markets. Because individualized binding
contracts cannot trade in anonymous markets a matching mechanism does not exist that would
allow for widespread use of bilateral contracts as a risk sharing device. Perhaps because there
are far fewer firms than agents in the economy, so it is easier to match firms and agents, we do
observe binding bilateral labor contracts written between agents and firms. However, even these
contracts are limited. Both equity and labor contracts are one sided in the sense that typically
firms commit to make payments to agents. Agents very rarely commit to make payments to
firms and courts rarely enforce such contracts. The only condition under which agents can enter
a contract that commits them to make payments is if they take a loan from a bank. Both firms
12

and agents can either borrow or lend from a bank subject to the condition that in equilibrium
the supply of loans must equal the amount of deposits. Thus, the span of traded assets consists
of debt and equity. As we will see, there is no default in equilibrium so the interest rate banks
pay is the risk free rate.
We also impose the following restriction on the industries in which firms operate:
Restriction 2 Firms are restricted to operate in only one industry. That is, all workers in a
firm must have the same b and f .
In reality, most firms operate in a single industry. Although conglomerates do exist, even these
firms typically operate in only a few industries. Our results would not change if we allowed firms
to operate in finitely many industries. What we cannot allow is a firm that operates in every
industry.
We assume that there is a (very) small cost to dynamic trading in capital markets:
Restriction 3 Dynamic trading in equity markets imposes a utility cost of  = 0+ per unit
time.
This restriction captures transaction costs of active trading, as well as the utility cost of designating time and effort to active portfolio rebalancing strategies. The condition implies that an
equilibrium outcome that does not require active portfolio trading in asset markets dominates
an equilibrium that is identical in real terms, but that does require active portfolio trading. We
do not impose any transaction costs of switching jobs, although it can be argued that such costs
are also present, and in fact may be higher than the costs of dynamic trading in asset markets.
The reason we do not impose these costs is they would not change our results qualitatively,
although the analysis would be far less tractable.11
We are now ready to describe how the complete markets equilibrium can be implemented
under these restrictions. At first glance it might appear as if asset markets are unnecessary. After
all, we allow firms to write bilateral contracts with agents, so by serving as an intermediary,
firms can effectively allow agents to write bilateral contracts between themselves. For example,
firms could hire both types of workers, pool their production and reallocate it by paying wages
equal to a constant fraction of the total. However, such contracts alone cannot implement the
Pareto optimal equilibrium. The reason is that in such an equilibrium, although risk is efficiently
shared conditional on production, total production is not maximized — flexible workers must
switch industries in order to maximize their production. But the only way for the firm to pool
production and reallocate it would be to extract a commitment of lifetime employment from
11

The key point here is that, even with small friction costs of job-switching, it will still be optimal for the flexible
agent to switch industries (and for the inflexible agent to stay in the same industry), since the productivity loss
of not switching is significant. The only difference is that he will switch industries less often when the friction is
present.

13

flexible workers. Such a commitment is suboptimal. Because of the need for worker mobility,
both labor and asset markets are required to implement the complete markets equilibrium.
To achieve the complete market equilibrium all inflexible agents sign a binding employment
contract with firms in the industry of their specialty that commits both parties to lifetime
employment.12 Agents give up all their productivity and in return receive a wage equal to
their Pareto optimal equilibrium allocation, η(s0 )At Ktot (s), in every future state s. Flexible
agents either choose to work for themselves, or work for firms and earn wages equal to their
productivity. This means that in some states inflexible wages will exceed productivity. Because
firms cannot force investors to make payments, firms require capital to credibly commit to the
labor contract. They raise this capital by issuing limited liability equity. In states in which
wages exceed productivity, the firm uses this capital to make up the shortfall and does not pay
dividends. For the moment we restrict attention to states in which the capital in the firm is
positive.
Flexible agents purchase the equity by borrowing the required capital from the bank. Firms
then redeposit the capital in the bank (ensuring that the supply of deposits equals the demand
for loans) and pay instantaneous dividend flows equal to
At max(αKI (s) + Ct rs − ηKtot (s), 0),
where At Ct is the amount of capital owned by the firm at time t and η ≡ η(s0 ). Thus, flexible
agents consume


At (1 − α)KF (s) + max(αKI (s) + Ct rs − ηKtot (s), 0) − Ct rs ,

(19)

where we assume (and later show) that flexible agents always choose to adjust their bank loans
to match the capital firms deposit in the bank. Using (6), when dividends are positive, the term
in square brackets in (19) becomes
(1 − α)KF (s) + αKI (s) + Ct rs − ηKtot (s) − Ct rs = (1 − η)Ktot (s),

(20)

so flexible agents consume their complete market allocation and dCt = 0. Similarly, when
dividends are zero we get
(1 − α)KF (s) − Ct rs +

dCt

(21)

12
In reality, employment contracts that bind workers are not enforceable. However, about half the working
population do in fact work for a single employer (see Hall (1982)). As we discuss in the conclusion, this suggests
that the lifetime employment contract is nevertheless common, that is, that firms use other means to commit
employees to lifetime employment.

14

Now the stochastic change in firm capital equals the shortfall, that is,
dCt = (αKI (s) + Ct rs − ηKtot (s))dt.
Substituting this expression into (21) gives
(1 − α)KF (s) − Ct rs + (αKI (s) + Ct rs − ηKtot (s)) = (1 − η)Ktot (s),

(22)

so the flexible agent consumes his complete markets allocation in every state in which the firm’s
capital is positive.
Finally, consider the first time that either the value of the firm drops to zero or the firm’s
capital drops to zero. In such a state the firm can raise additional capital by issuing new equity
(either by repurchasing existing equity for zero and issuing new equity to raise capital, or if the
equity is not worth zero, issuing new equity at the market price). Hence by always issuing new
capital in this state, the firm can ensure that neither its capital, nor its value, ever drops below
zero and that it never pays negative dividends. Thus in this equilibrium both agents always
consume their complete markets allocation which is Pareto optimal. This implies that flexible
agents cannot be better off by following a different borrowing policy, justifying our assumption
that they will always choose to borrow the amount firms deposit in the bank. Moreover, since
this outcome implies a passive investment strategy for inflexible, as well as flexible, agents, this
equilibrium implementation is optimal under the assumption of a small but positive cost of
active rebalancing.13
The following proposition summarizes these results:
Proposition 3 The following implementation leads to the complete market Pareto efficient outcome:
• Flexible workers either work for themselves or a firm which pays the instantaneous wage
wF = At KF (st ).
• Inflexible workers work for publicly traded firms, which pay instantaneous wages equal to
a constant multiple of aggregate production. In aggregate, firms pay the inflexible wage
wI = ηAt Ktot (st ).
• In states in which inflexible productivity plus interest on bank deposits exceeds wages, firms
13

In fact, if in addition one assumes a (small) one-time cost of stock market participation, it is easy to show
that this optimal implementation is unique, since it minimizes the fraction of the population that participates in
the market.

15

pay dividends equal to
At [αKI (s) + Ct rs − ηKtot (s)]

(23)

and retain capital At Ct with dCt = 0
• In states in which inflexible productivity plus interest on bank deposits does not exceed
wages, firms pay no dividends and reduce capital to make wage payments
dCt = (αKI (s) + Ct rs − ηKtot (s))dt

(24)

• The flexible workers own all the equity in the stock market. They pay for this equity by
borrowing the capital from banks. Firms redeposit the capital in banks. Flexible workers
optimally adjust their borrowing to ensure that at all times the supply of deposits equals
the demand for loans.
• Whenever: (1) the price of the firm drops to zero, the firm raises new capital by repurchasing old equity for nothing and issuing new equity or (2) the amount of capital drops
to zero, the firm raises new capital by issuing new equity at the market price.

There are three important distinguishing characteristics of this solution that reflect reality.
First, it features limited capital market participation — only flexible workers participate in capital markets. Indeed, because job mobility precludes flexible workers from sharing risk in labor
markets they must participate in capital markets for any risk sharing to take place. Without
understanding the importance of the labor market, one might naively look at inflexible workers’
wealth and conclude that because this wealth is non-tradable, they would be better off using
asset markets to hedge some of this exposure. In equilibrium inflexible workers choose not to
further hedge their human capital risk exposure because it is too costly. Flexible workers choose
to hold equity, not because of a desire to hedge — they choose to increase the riskiness of their
position — but because of the compensation they receive in terms of a high equity risk premium.
The implication, that inflexible workers choose not to participate in markets is consistent
with one of the most robust findings in the literature — that wealth and education are positively
correlated with stock market participation (see Mankiw and Zeldes (1991)). Clearly, flexible
workers are wealthier in our model, but more importantly, if productive flexibility derives from
education, then they are likely to be better educated. In fact, Christiansen, Joensen, and
Rangvid (2008) show that the degree of economics education is casually (positively) related to
stock market participation. They interpret this result as evidence that non-participation derives
from educational barriers to entry. But their results are also consistent with flexibility. Not
all education provides productive flexibility so we would expect to see variation in the type of
16

education and stock market participation. Their study clearly documents this variation. Finally,
note that non-participation in capital markets implies that inflexible workers also do not hold
bonds, that is, they choose not to save. This result might help to explain the low savings rate
observed in the U.S. — the reason workers choose not to save is that their labor contracts
effectively do the saving for them.
A second distinguishing characteristic of our solution is that firm equity can be thought of as
an option-like claim on total consumption. We therefore expect the volatility of equity returns
to exceed the volatility of total consumption. Because we do not have idiosyncratic risk in our
setting, this volatility imparts risk — equity is considerably more risky than total consumption.
That equity can be viewed as an option is well known. However, normally this insight is
derived using financial leverage. In our case the firm has no debt, indeed it actually holds
cash. In a standard setting this would mean that equity would not have option characteristics,
indeed, because of the cash, equity would be less risky than the firm’s assets. In our setting, it
is not financial leverage that gives equity option-like characteristics, but the operating leverage
resulting from wage commitments. Notice that this operating leverage is considerably more
risky than the typical kind of operating leverage studied in the literature. Typically, firms have
the option to shut down — if a firm is losing money on the margin then it can reduce its scale
or shut down altogether. However, in our case firms optimally choose to give up this option —
they commit to continue to pay wages even when, ex post, the value maximizing decision would
be to shut down and pay out the remaining capital to equity holders. As we will demonstrate in
the next section, by giving up this option, the firm substantially increases the risk of its equity.
Finally, note that asset returns will vary with the business cycle in a highly nonlinear fashion,
because of the role of firms as insurers. This means that the unconditional link between real
variables and asset returns can look quite weak even though they are instantaneously perfectly
correlated. In fact, as we shall see, our results are in line with the findings in Duffee (2005), that
consumption and equity returns are only weakly related in bad times, but are highly correlated
in good times.
Two important challenges to the neoclassical asset pricing model are its inability to produce
a realistic equity risk premium and the seemingly large disparity between consumption and
equity volatility. As we have already pointed out, our model has the potential to meet these
challenges. Consequently, in the next section, we investigate whether, for realistic parameter
values, our model can reproduce the magnitude of the observed empirical anomalies.

5

Parameterization

The objective of this section is to show that the effects we have identified are first order, that
is, large enough to potentially explain the empirical facts. We will demonstrate that for a set
of realistic parameter values, the model can match the magnitude of the important moments in

17

the data. Although we view this as an achievement in itself — without the labor market, the
model in this paper, essentially a Lucas tree economy, could not come close to matching these
moments — deciding whether labor markets really can explain empirical puzzles such as limited
market participation will require further empirical investigation.
We assume that flexible workers make up 1/3 of the working population, implying that 2/3
of the population choose not to participate directly in capital markets, in line with the estimates
reported in Haliassos and Bertaut (1995), Guiso, Haliassos, Jappelli, and Claessens (2003),
Hong, Kubik, and Stein (2004), and Christiansen, Joensen, and Rangvid (2008). Assume that

Note that here we assume that f (b) = f implying that a state exists in which all workers work in the same

The total production of inflexible agents is then
KI (s) = 0.5 + 1.656s.

(27)

These are the two production functions we plotted in Figure 1.
The state process, s, evolves according to (1), with parameter values θ = 0.003, σ = 6%
and s = 0.67. The economy is thus in a recession when s < 0.67 and when s > 0.67 it is in
a boom. With these parameters, the unconditional probability that 0 < st < 2 is 97%, so we
focus on this range. The long-term growth rate of the economy is r = 1.2%. This implies an
unconditional consumption growth volatility of about 4%, which is in line with what was used
in Mehra and Prescott (1985). We use standard values for the preference parameters. We pick
a relative risk aversion coefficient of 8.5, within the range Mehra and Prescott (1985, p. 154)
consider reasonable, and impatience parameter ρ = 0.5%.

Table 1: Parameter Values

We set the initial s equal to s∗ . Since this implies that the inflexible workers get their highest
possible share of production, it is never optimal for them to quit the firm and so they will never
have an incentive to depart from the long-term contract they sign with firms.
The initial capital the firm raises is arbitrary in our model — because we have an effectively
complete asset market, the Modigliani-Miller proposition implies that the firm’s capital structure
is irrelevant. Of course, in a world with frictions the amount of capital raised will affected by
a tradeoff between the benefits (e.g., lower transaction costs) and costs (e.g., increased taxes
and agency costs). We pick a level of initial capital that ensures that firms almost never need
to return to capital markets15 and to match the price volatility of the market, which we set to
16.6%. This leads to initial capital of C0 = 0.88. Table 1 summarizes these parameter values.

We solve for the complete markets equilibrium by solving (18) numerically. Table 2 summarizes this equilibrium. To compute Wi , we set δ = Ki (s) for each agent type i ∈ {I, F }
in (15).16 We then compute η, the inflexible agents’ wealth share, by solving (14) and get
65.0%. In this equilibrium the risk free rate is 4.2% and the firm’s expected return is 8.3%,
leading to a equity risk premium of 4.2%. The model also delivers realistic second moments.
Firm volatility is 16.6% whereas consumption volatility is only 4.3%. More interesting is the
unconditional correlation between equity returns and consumption. Because this is a standard
neo-classical model, consumption prices assets, so the instantaneous correlation between equity
returns and consumption is either 1 or -1 (as we will shortly see, equity values can be decreasing
in the state variable). However, the average correlation across all states is only 0.4, that is, the
unconditional correlation (what empiricists typically measure) is substantially lower than the
instantaneous correlation. The instantaneous equity premium is re − rs = ρpc γσc σp . If we use
unconditional moments to evaluate this expression we get 0.40 × 8.5 × 4.3% × 16.6% = 2.4%,
which is approximately half of the actual unconditional equity premium of 4.1%. This disparity
occurs because the unconditional estimate of the correlation is not a good proxy for the actual
variable of interest, the instantaneous correlation.

Table 2: Equilibrium Moment Values at s0

An important feature of the model is that the value of equity is highly non-linear in the state
variable. Note that the value of the firm, V (st , Ct ), is equal to the amount of cash plus the value
of inflexible worker productivity minus the value of the wage commitment:
V (st , Ct ) = αWI (st ) + Ct − ηWtot (st ),

(28)

16
Notice that Ki (s) is time independent, so (18) degenerates into an ODE, and the price function is also time
independent. It is easy to show that the boundary condition at z = 1 for the ODE is Q(1) = 0. We know of no
simple boundary specification at z = 0, however, since the boundary is not absorbing for the square root process.
In other words, finding the transversality condition that rules out bubbles is nontrivial. Therefore, we solve the
PDE and let the terminal date, T , become so large that the solution becomes effectively time independent. This
is the correct, no-bubble, solution in the infinite horizon economy.

price function is highly nonlinear in s. Its option-like qualities are self evident. The function is
insensitive to the state variable for low values of s — it is actually slightly decreasing for very
low s. It then increases rapidly in a convex fashion for low to high s, after which it reaches a
maximum for very high s and becomes decreasing.
To understand the dynamic behavior of equity across the business cycle, note that as the
state of the economy worsens, dividend payouts decrease, reflecting that fact that wages exceed
productivity. Consequently, the value of the firm drops sharply. To understand what happens
when the economy deteriorates further, we must first understand the dynamics of interest rates.

21

When the economy is in a very bad state, productivity is low but agents propensity to consume
does not drop by as much. The reason is that because the state variable is mean reverting, agents
understand that the current state is temporary. They therefore anticipate that the economy is
likely to improve and because they want to smooth consumption, they have a propensity to
borrow to consume. In equilibrium net borrowing is zero, so interest rates have to rise to clear
markets, as is evident in Figure 4. Because the firm holds cash, this increase in interest rates
generates interest income for the firm. Eventually, the increase in interest rates dominates the
decrease in worker productivity, so that dividends begin to increase again, as is evident in the
lower panel in Figure 3. The result is that for very low values of the state variable the value of
the firm is actually decreasing in s. Note that D and P are both nonnegative within the range
of the plots, and therefore there is no need for refinancing within this range.17

Using (28), Figure 4 plots this function, together with the risk-free rate. The most striking
element in the plot is the difference in behavior of the equity risk premium in expansions and
contractions. When s > s̄ the equity risk premium is decreasing in the state variable, which
makes intuitive sense. Equity is an insurance contract, for high values of the state variable
the insurance contract is not very risky. In contractions, the equity risk premium continues to
increase as the state deteriorates, reaching a maximum of about 13%. But then, as the value
of equity becomes less sensitive to the state of the economy, the risk premium begins to drop
and, for low enough values of s, actually becomes negative. At the mean point of state variable,
s = s̄ = 0.67, expected stock returns are about 9.5%, which is close to the unconditional expected
return of 8.3%. However, at s̄, the equity risk premium is 8.2%, which is substantially higher
than the unconditional equity premium of 4.1%.
An important implication of the nonlinearity in the price function is that it weakens the
link between consumption and returns. In particular, the correlation between consumption and
returns is different in expansions and contractions. The estimated correlation in our calibration
conditional on being in a contraction (s < 0.67) is 0.23, whereas the estimated correlation
conditional on being in an expansion (s > 0.67) is 0.81. This disparity is in line with the results
in Duffee (2005) that the correlation between stock returns and consumption growth is low
(about 0) in bad times, and high (about 0.6) in good times.
It is informative to compare our results with those in Danthine and Donaldson (2002).
Although Danthine and Donaldson (2002) also model the effect of labor markets on asset prices,
they are unable to match the equity risk premium in a model without frictions.18 By introducing
frictions they are able to match the risk premium, but at the cost of perfect risk sharing. In
particular, to get a significant risk premium, their restriction limiting market participation
becomes important. Without it, workers would invest in markets and thereby increase risk
sharing. Not only would the equilibrium not feature limited stock market participation, but the
ability to share additional risk would likely reduce the risk premium. Because we do not impose
limited capital market participation, flexible workers must be induced to take on additional risk
in equilibrium. That implies that the return on equity (the means by which flexible workers
take on this risk) has to be high enough to induce this behavior. This is a key insight in our
model — rather than a place to hedge risk and smooth consumption, asset markets are a place
where investors are induced to take on extra risk.
Because we do not have idiosyncratic risk in our model, an increase in the risk premium must
18
They introduce two frictions in their model: (1) Adjustment costs, which provides only a modest increase in
the risk premium and (2) changes in the “bargaining power” of workers and investors that effectively prevents
perfect risk sharing.

23

be associated with an increase in volatility. Figure 5 confirms this insight. The volatility of the
firm initially explodes in bad states, in line with the empirical evidence cited in the introduction.
But then it actually starts decreasing, reflecting the fact that the value of equity becomes less
sensitive to the state variable (see Figure 3, top panel), until it actually reaches zero close to 0.2.
For even lower s, price is decreasing in s, and so volatility increases. Finally, volatility decreases
again as s approaches 0 and as the volatility of ds becomes negligible, once again decreasing the
equity volatility. Thus, the volatility of the firm is a nonlinear function of s, with regions of very
high volatility in bad states of the world. More importantly, the same is not true of the volatility
of consumption growth — it is virtually unaffected by the level of s. Our model actually delivers
an almost complete disconnect between consumption volatility and asset volatility, something
that is traditionally regarded as perhaps the greatest challenge to the neoclassical asset pricing
model. This figure, more than any other, makes clear how the interaction between labor and
financial markets can dramatically affect the inferences of the neoclassical asset pricing model.
In our model, the consumption CAPM holds by construction. In line with the empirical evidence
referenced in the introduction, consumption growth volatility is low and virtually unaffected by
the business cycle. Asset volatility, on the other hand, is significantly higher and is very sensitive
to the business cycle.
Finally, it makes sense to consider how the equilibrium changes as a function of the initial
state. Figure 6 plots the equilibrium share of total consumption of inflexible agents, η(s0 ).
What is clear is that for most values of the state variable, the equilibrium consumption share is
insensitive to the initial state. The figure also shows the initial aggregate instantaneous relative
productivity,

s0 ≈ 0.7, whereas

of inflexible agents. We see that
η∗

reaches its maximum, α (i.e., 2/3), at

≈ 1.8. The reason η is maximized to the right

of the point where the inflexible agent’s relative productivity is maximized is that the value
of insurance is greater in the bad states than in the good states. Hence, inflexible agents are
willing to pay more for insurance at the point where their production share is maximized than
at points to the right, so η continues to increase.

Conclusions

Our objective in this paper is to demonstrate the potential importance of explicitly modeling
labor markets within the neoclassical asset pricing model. We show that neither the asset market nor the labor market, by themselves, can share risk efficiently. Labor markets are restricted
because it is inefficient for some workers to enter long-term contracts, and asset markets are
restricted because the (static) asset span is too narrow. But together the two markets can share
risk efficiently. By explicitly modeling the interaction between the two markets, we demonstrate
the potential to explain some of the most important normative challenges faced by the neoclassical asset pricing model: (1) limited asset market participation, (2) the seemingly high equity

risk premium, (3) the very large disparity in the volatility of consumption and the volatility
of asset prices, and (4) the time dependent correlation between consumption growth and asset
returns.
Although our model is stylized it captures most of the salient features of both labor and
asset markets. The one apparent exception is that in the model it is optimal for some agents
to commit to lifetime employment with a single firm. In reality, although firms often commit
to employ agents, rarely do agents explicitly commit to stay with firms. Nevertheless, there is
strong empirical evidence suggesting that in fact a large subset of employees implicitly commit
to firms, consistent with the assumptions of our model. Hall (1982) finds that after an initial
job search in which employees might work for short periods for different employers, half of all
men then work the rest of their lives for a single employer.
There are a number of ways employees may implicitly commit to firms. First, employees
might never actually face an incentive to leave, making an explicit commitment unnecessary as
is the case in our parameterization in Section 5. To the extent that there are costs to switching
jobs, workers will not choose to switch jobs so long as the switching costs exceed the benefits.

Figure 6: Sensitivity of the Equilibrium to the Initial State: The solid curve is the
equilibrium share of wealth of the inflexible worker at t = 0, η, as a function of the initial s0 .
The dashed curve is the inflexible agents aggregate share of total productivity at time 0.

Because η(s) is flat around s∗ (see Figure 6), only a small cost of switching jobs is required to
ensure that agents will not have an incentive to switch jobs for most starting values of s.
Second, agents can increase the costs of switching further and thereby effectively commit to
firms by, for example, accepting deferred compensation contracts. Examples include pension
funds and stock vesting periods. In addition many union contracts explicitly tie wages to
seniority with the firm, making a job switch very costly.
Third, the initial training costs that workers must bear when they start a new job act
as a commitment device. Although employers might ultimately compensate workers for these
costs through higher long-term wages, workers will have to remain employed to collect this
compensation.
Notice that while it is socially suboptimal for inflexible workers to switch jobs, it is optimal
for flexible workers to do so. Hence, one might expect to see differences in the costs of switching,
because incentives exist to lower the switching costs for flexible workers and increase these costs
for inflexible workers. This observation might explain why, for example, head hunters tend to
specialize in managerial jobs (where the skill set can be readily transfered across industries).

Although outside the scope of this paper, our model has potentially interesting implications
for the cross-section of asset returns. For simplicity we assumed only one type of firm in our
calibration, but, in general, firms with different labor market exposures will have expected
returns which will depend on the insurance contract that the firm signs with its workers. Firms
that are sensitive to changes in s (i.e., firms with bi close to 0), will provide more insurance in
bad states than firms that are less sensitive (firms with bi close to 1). Equity holders in these
firms will therefore require higher returns. In addition, because of the non-linearity of returns,
CAPM betas — either unconditional or conditional — are likely to have little explanatory power
in the cross section.
Because inflexible workers only consume their wage income, our model implies that the wages
of inflexible workers should have explanatory power in the cross-section. A measure of labor
mobility across firms (which should be closely related to our flexibility notion) is constructed in
Donangelo (2009), using survey data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics between 1988-2008.
Such a measure could potentially be used to disentangle the two sides of the work force. It is
also interesting to note that in our model aggregate wages, which include wages of both flexible
and inflexible workers — i.e., wages of both “insurers” and “insurees” — should be considerably
less informative about expected returns, in line with the findings of Fama and Schwert (1977).
These observations provide a potentially interesting path for future research.

Appendix
Proof of Lemma 1: (a) Follows since f is decreasing and f (0) = 1.
(b) Clearly, Ks ≤ CF (s) ≤ Ks + 1 for all s, since the lower bound can be realized by choosing
b(s) = 1, and the upper bound follows from the constraint that b ≤ 1. (b) therefore immediately follows.
(c) Follows since b + f (b)s is (weakly) convex as a function of s for each b and the maximum of a set
of convex functions is convex.
Proof of Lemma 2: The flexible worker solves maxb∈[0,1] b + f (b)s. The first order condition is f 0 (b) =
− 1s , and since f 0 is a continuously differentiable, strictly decreasing, mapping from [0, 1] onto (−∞, 0], the
implicit function theorem implies that there is a unique, decreasing, continuously differentiable solution
to the first order condition, b∗ (s), such that b∗ (0) = 1 and lims→∞ b∗ (s) = 0. Since the second order
condition is f 00 (b)s < 0, this function indeed yields the maximal strategy, KF (s) = b∗ (s) + f (b∗ (s))s.
Now, KF0 (s) = b∗0 (s) + b∗0 (s)f (b∗ (s))s + f (b∗ (s)) = 0 + f (b∗ (s)), so KF0 (0) = f (b∗ (0)) = f (1) = 0,
∗0
and KF0 (∞) = f (b∗ (∞)) = f (0) = K. Moreover, KF00 (s) = b∗0 (s)f 0 (b∗ (s)) = − b s(s) , which is continuous
and positive, so KF is indeed strictly convex and twice continuously differentiable.

and therefore f (b∗ (s)) → K, the flexible worker’s productivity is indeed riskier for large s. The lemma is
