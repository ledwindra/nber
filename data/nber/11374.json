    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper asks how a fiscal expansion would affect Japan. It uses a textbook-style macro model calibrated to fit the Japanese economy. According to the results, Japan's output slump would be ended by a fiscal transfer of 6.6% of GDP. This policy raises the debt-income ratio in the short run, but it reduces this ratio in the long run through higher inflation and tax revenue.  The financing of the transfer -- bonds or money -- affects debt in the short run but not the long run.\n\n",
