Introduction

Only eight percent of Americans report never spending the evening with a friend.1 Aspects
of the social structure such as trust, networks, and conventions that encourage collaboration and
coordination between friends and strangers determine our ability to achieve common goals. These
beneficial relations among organizations and individuals, referred to as social capital (Coleman
1990), have important economic ramifications. Social interactions and networks are mechanisms
for the provision of public goods and for the transmission of new ideas and of shared values,
increasing aggregate human knowledge and developing the trust necessary for the functioning of
capital and labor markets. La Porta et al. (1997) show that worldwide trust is associated with more
efficient judiciaries, less corruption, and higher quality government bureaucracies. Knack and
Keefer (1997) find that trust predicts economic growth and Guiso et al. (2000) find that it predicts
financial development. Toqueville (1840, 1981: 137-141) argued that democratic countries that
lost the habit of association would find their very civilizations in peril because they had no other
substitutes for reciprocal action.
Despite the importance of social capital to society, individuals have few incentives to
participate within the community. This free-rider problem may be growing worse over time.
Putnam (2000) documents a decline in social and civic engagement that has alarmed policy
makers.

This paper evaluates trends in social capital since 1952 and finds that the decline in
social capital has been over-stated. It assesses explanations for the declines that are observed
since the 1970s using a wide array of data sources. It examines both social capital produced
outside the home (volunteering, membership in organizations) and social capital produced within
the home (entertaining friends and relatives). We examine both types of social capital because
that produced within the home is important for the social development of children (Loury 1977)
and that produced in the community for the provision of public goods.
We investigate the role of rising work hours among women and among the collegeeducated (two groups that supply many of the nation’s volunteer workers (Freeman 1997; Banks
and Tanner 1998)) and growing income, racial, and ethnic heterogeneity within communities in
the decline in social capital since the 1970s. Putnam (2000) argued that television and the aging
of the “civic” generations born between 1910 and 1940 are the primary culprits. We argue that
rising community heterogeneity, particularly income inequality, and the rise in women’s labor
force participation rates are the primary explanations, with the rise in income inequality closely
matching the decline in social capital.

2

Empirical Framework

Social capital is embodied in the relations between individuals and organizations. The level of
social capital within a community depends on both the demand for and supply of social capital.
Supply depends on individuals’ willingness to participate in the community and this in turn
depends on individuals’ socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and on the characteristics
of the community.
Micro-economic and demographic change can lead to declines in the total level of
social capital, particularly in social capital activities produced largely within the home, such

2

as entertaining, and, to a lesser extent, visits with friends, relatives, and neighbors. As Glaeser,
Laibson, and Sacerdote (2000) point out, the market and non-market returns from interactions with
others are likely to rise and then fall with age and to depend upon mobility, distance, occupation,
and patience (and therefore upon education). The rise in women’s labor force participation could
decrease entertainment for pleasure but increase entertainment for business purposes. Increases in
work hours by the college educated could have the same effect. Declines in fertility rates since the
1970s could reduce social capital related to children but increase social capital related to adults.
Rising mobility may increase the difficulty of maintaining relationships with friends, relatives,
and neighbors, but it might lead individuals to spend more time with friends or neighbors instead
of family members. Economic and demographic trends will also affect social capital outside the
home, such as volunteer work and organizational membership. Increases in hours worked by the
college-educated may have reduced the available time for volunteer work by highly productive
individuals. Because women are disproportionately likely to volunteer (e.g. Freeman 1997), the
rise in women’s labor force participation may have reduced women’s available volunteer time,
but increased their membership in professional organizations.
Alesina and LaFerrara (2000; forthcoming), in contrast, emphasize the role of macrocommunity factors in the production of social capital. Community heterogeneity can decrease
community participation because people prefer to associate with others like them. Rising income
inequality and growing racial and ethnic fragmentation can therefore decrease social capital,
particularly for such social capital activities produced outside the home as volunteer work and
organizational membership. Which of these measures of community heterogeneity best predicts
social capital trends depends upon both the magnitude of the change in each of these measures
and upon whether people measure their distance to others in terms of class, race, or ethnicity.
Empirical evidence for the United States has mainly emphasized the role of race in lowering
social capital and in the provision of public goods (e.g. Alesina and La Ferrara 2000; Luttmer,

3

forthcoming; Poterba 1997), but there is also evidence of the importance of income inequality
and of ethnic fragmentation (Alesina, Baquir, and Easterly 1999; Alesina and La Ferrara 2000,
forthcoming; Goldin and Katz 1999).
Social capital may decline because demand falls. If social networks mainly serve an
insurance purpose, then as society becomes richer, this need may dissipate. Higher human capital
individuals may be more productive volunteers or organization members and therefore in greater
demand (Freeman 1997). As organizations become more professionalized, they may prefer
cash to volunteers or want only the time of individuals with high opportunities in the private
sector. If non-profits “professionalize,” the “warm glow” (Andreoni 1990) from participation
may diminish. Finally, the volunteer sector, like others in the economy, may be undergoing skill
biased technological change.
We measure social capital using 1) volunteer activity, 2) organizational membership and
activity, and 3) entertaining and visits with friends, relatives, and neighbors. After establishing
what types of social capital have declined, we test whether declines can be attributed to changes
in hours worked, rising mobility, the rise in women’s labor force participation rates, and growing
community heterogeneity. Our measures of social capital focus mainly on the residential community and on the family. The residential community is important because voting is based upon
place of residence, not upon place of work. We recognize that there is social capital in the workplace. However, there cannot be an under-supply of social capital in the workplace because firms
with potential agency problems will create a culture of mutual monitoring and social interactions
(Kandel and Lazear 1992). We are not measuring the number of social interactions that people
have with others. Our goal is to measure inputs in the production of social capital. We examine
measures that are likely to be particularly conducive to generating the beneficial effects of social
capital, such as the transmission of knowledge, and the development of trust. Participation in

4

groups is also correlated with political participation (Verba and Nie 1972).2
Our empirical strategy examines how changes in individual and community characteristics affect the time trend in our measures of social capital. We estimate probit equations of the
form,
Prob(Vi

=

1)

=

Φ(Yi

Y +

f fi + Xi X )

(1)

Prob(Vi

=

1)

=

Φ(Yi

Y +

f fi + Yi fi f Y + Xi X )

(2)

Prob(Vi

=

1)

=

Φ(Yi

Y +

f fi + Yi fi f Y + Hi H + Xi X ) ;

(3)

where Vi is an indicator variable equal to one if individual i reported any time spent volunteering,
participating in organizations, or visiting family and friends, Yi is a vector of year dummies, fi
is a dummy equal to one if female, Hi is a vector of community heterogeneity variables, and

Xi is a vector of demographic characteristics, such as age, education, race, and marital status.
We determine how the coefficients on the year dummies change as we control for differential
trends between men and women and for community heterogeneity. Alesina and LaFerrara
(2000, forthcoming) used metropolitan area characteristics as their community variables. We
use both measures of metropolitan area characteristics and measures of within area metropolitan
heterogeneity.
Two caveats are in order. Note that because we are not estimating labor supply equations
we do not explicitly control for individuals’ value of time.3 Note also that community income
inequality is potentially endogenous. Frequent volunteering and participation in organizations

2

We do not examine voting because voting by itself does not produce social capital. We also do not examine
what predicts how much individuals’ trust others, because we view trust as an outcome not a choice.
3

Banks and Tanner (1998) find that wages have a positive and statistically significant effect on hours volunteered,
but no effect controlling for the replacement cost to the charity of volunteers’ time.

will lead to lower inequality if social capital improves the opportunities of the relatively poor. We
will therefore examine instrumental variable estimates as well.

Data

We examine trends in social capital and assess explanations for declines in social capital using an
exhaustive list of data sets drawn from studies of the labor force, studies of political participation,
social surveys, time use studies, marketing studies, and studies of volunteering.4 Table 1 summarizes the data sets that we use and provides a brief description of the social capital variables. The
Data Appendix provides more complete details.
We examine trends in volunteer activity using data from the United States Bureau of the
Census’ April 1974 and May 1989 Current Population Surveys (CPS), the annual 1975-1998 DDB
Life Style Survey (DDB) produced by DDB Worldwide and used by Putnam (2000), the biennual
1988-1996 Giving and Volunteering in the United States done by the Gallup Organization for
the Independent Sector, and the annual 1992-1999 The NPD Group Time Study Data. Because
individuals in the latter data set recorded activities during a half hour block in a 24 hour day,
we construct a variable indicating whether the individual spent any time volunteering. The other
data sets provide information on an annual basis. We therefore construct a variable indicating
whether a person did any volunteer activity in the past 12 months. As noted by Hayghe (1991),
the 1990 Giving and Volunteering in the United States (Gallup) reports that about 54 percent of
Americans older than 17 report having done some volunteer work during the 12 months prior to

4
We do not use the 1957 and 1976 surveys, Americans Views Their Mental Health (Gurin, Veroff, and Feld 1975;
Veroff, Douvan, and Kulka 1982). Although the questions asked in both years were exactly the same, the samples
are very non-represenative of the population in terms of membership in labor unions (very low) and amount of time
spent with family and friends (very high relative to the General Social Survey). We suspect that willingness to answer
a survey on mental health increased between 1957 and 1976 and that this might lead to the decrease in membership
in non-union organizations and in ties to family and friends observed between 1957 and 1976.

the survey, whereas the 1989 CPS reports that only 20 percent of the population over age 15 did
some volunteer work in the prior year. Differences in volunteering rates are probably attributable
to differences in survey response rates, in the way each survey was conducted, and in the kinds
of questions asked (see the Data Appendix for further details).
We study membership in organizations using political participation studies – the 1952
and 1972 American National Election Study (Campbell, Gurin, et al. 1999; Miller, Miller, et al.
1999), the 1960 Five Nation Study (Almond and Verba 1968), and the 1967 Political Participation
in America (Verba and Nie 1976), and using the 1974-1998 General Social Survey (Davis and
Smith 1999). The advantage of the General Social Survey (GSS) is that exactly the same questions
on membership were asked in each year. For this survey we construct a variable that is equal to one
if the individual was a member of any group. Because response rates increased in the GSS (Smith
1994), then, if the less civic minded became more likely to answer the survey, our variable may
overstate the decline in membership. For the political participation studies we restrict ourselves
to membership in non-church organizations, because of differences in the phrasing of questions
across earlier surveys. Such differences are particularly likely to affect reporting of membership
in church groups (e.g. church choirs) because of a context effect on membership in church groups
(Smith 1990). We analyze the determinants of trends in the earlier surveys using only the 1952
and 1972 American National Election Studies because these are the only surveys to identify
metropolitan areas.
We study time spent in an organizational activity using the 1965 and 1985 Americans’
Use of Time (Converse and Robinson 1980; Robinson 1993) and the 1975 Time Use in Economic
and Social Accounts (Juster et al. 1979). Our variable consists of whether an individual recorded
any time spent in an organizational activity in a 24 hour day. These data sets also allow us to study
time spent in entertainment activity. Our variable is based upon an individual recording in a 24
hour day any time spent 1) entertaining or visiting friends, 2) at a party or reception (with meals)

8

given by or for the respondent, and 3) at a party or reception, without meals, or in other social
life. These data sets do not identify metropolitan area. We also use the time diary information in
the 1992-1999 NPD data and construct a variable equal to one if the individual recorded any time
spent visiting friends or relatives.
We also examine social capital produced inside the home, using data from the GSS and
the DDB. From the DDB we construct a dummy variable equal to one if an individual reported
that she “entertained people in my home” 12-24 times in the last 12 months and a dummy variable
equal to one if an individual agrees with the statement “our whole family usually eats dinner
together.” These measures proxy for the socialization of children and young adults. From the
GSS we construct three dummy variables equal to one if an individual reported that at least several
times a month he spent a social evening with relatives, neighbors, and friends, respectively.
We create variables of metropolitan area characteristics from the integrated public use
census samples (Ruggles and Sobek 1997) and use metropolitan area measures of sorting by
income (Jargowsky 1996) and race (Cutler, Glaeser, Vigdor 1999). Complete details are provided
in the Data Appendix. We calculate, by metropolitan area, the Gini coefficient of weekly wages
for full-time, full-year men age 21 to 64. We use Jargowsky’s (1996) neighborhood sorting index
(NSI) as a measure of neighborhood (census tract) income segregation by metropolitan area. The
NSI is

N
q

NSI =
PH

(

i=1 (yi

; ȳ)2=H

where y is income, i indexes households, n indexes neighborhoods, hn is the number of households in neighborhood n, and H and N are the total number of households and neighborhoods
respectively. If all neighborhoods have the same mean income the index takes the value 0 whereas
if all households live in neighborhoods with a mean income identical to their own income then

9

the index will equal one. We also calculate racial and birthplace fragmentation indexes. For
example, our racial fragmentation index for each metropolitan area, i, is

fi = 1 ;

Xs
k

ki ;
2

where k represents the categories (white, black, American Indian, Asian, and other) and where

ski is the share of race k in metropolitan area i. As discussed in the Appendix, our birthplace
fragmentation index is similarly constructed. We also use the racial isolation index created by
Cutler, Glaeser, and Vigdor (1999), create a variable that is the logarithm of metropolitan area
population and a variable that is equal to the average weekly wage for full-time, full-year men
age 21 to 64 by metropolitan area, and create variables giving the fraction of the labor force in
manufacturing and in the public sector. We use the latter two variables as instruments for the
Gini coefficient because inequality is lower the higher the share of the labor force employed in
manufacturing and in public administration. We control for metropolitan area because community
involvement is lower in major metropolitan areas (Putnam 2000: 206). We control for the average
metropolitan area wage because wealthier communities may have less of a need for the insurance
component of social capital.
Our other control variables consist of dummies indicating year, sex, whether the individual is white, whether the individual is married, whether the individual is in the labor force
(when the dependent variable is not volunteering), age (using 5 year age dummies), education
(less than high school, high school, some college, post-college), and 9 regional dummies. When
possible we control for number of children in the household.
We restrict all data to individuals age 25 to 54 both to obtain a narrower cohort and
to focus on individuals in their prime working ages. We restrict all of the DDB data to married
individuals because only married individuals were interviewed in the early years of the survey.

Trends

4.1 Economic Trends
Micro-economic trends since 1950 in women’s labor force participation rates, in weekly hours
worked, and in mobility will affect social capital (see Table 2). The labor force participation rate
of married women rose from 24 percent in 1950 to 43 percent in 1970 and by 1990 stood at 71
percent. Women’s fertility reached a peak in 1970 and then declined sharply. Another change has
been in work hours. Although average hours have remained unchanged, the distribution of hours
has changed. In 1950 the work week of the college-educated and of those with less than a college
education was similar. By the century’s end, the college-educated were working the longest work
week (see Coleman and Pencavel 1993a, 1993b and Costa 2000).
Time diaries show that the typical day of American men and women has changed
considerably since the mid-1960s (see Table 3). In contrast to self-reports, the work hours of men
have fallen. Women’s work hours have risen, but their combined market and non-market work
time fell from 494 minutes in 1965 to 460 minutes in 1985 and also fell in the 1990s. Travel
time (whether for work or errands) has remained unchanged, suggesting that increases in sprawl
cannot explain declines in social capital. Men’s TV watching has been rising, but women’s has
remained unchanged since 1975, implying that declines in social capital among women since
the 1970s cannot be attributed to television. The amount of non-work time spent at work has
fallen, suggesting that there has not been substitution of socialization to the workplace from the
community.
Metropolitan areas have become more fragmented since the 1970s. Wage (and also
household income) inequality rose slightly from 1950 to 1970 and then substantially from 1970
to 1990. Racial fragmentation rose sharply between 1950 and 1970, peaked in 1980, and then fell
in 1990. Birthplace fragmentation decreased between 1950 and 1970 and then rose back to 1950

(Ruggles and Sobek 1997) and for 1998 and 1999 (combined) from the Current Population Surveys. Full-time
employment is defined as 35 hours a week or more. Population weights used for 1950, 1990, and 1998/1999.

Based upon the population weighted mean over all metropolitan areas. The neighborhood sorting index is from
Jargowsky (1996) and the racial isoloation index from Cutler, Glaeser, and Vigdor (1999). All other measures are
calculated from the integrated public use census samples (Ruggles and Sobek 1997). All identified metropolitan areas
are included. Restricting the data to metropolitan areas that are identified in all years does not change the results.

levels in 1990 as the fraction of the foreign-born population increased. However, neighborhood
sorting by income has increased, implying that within a metropolitan area, communities have
become more homogeneous. If rising community heterogeneity leads to declines in social capital,
then trends in racial fragmentation predict declines from 1950 to 1970, trends in racial isolation
declines from 1970 to 1990, and trends in birthplace fragmentation increases from 1950 to 1970
and declines since 1970. Trends in wage inequality imply that social capital should have fallen
from 1970 to 1990, but not necessarily from 1950 to 1970. Because the returns to education
and wage inequality increased sharply between 1980 and 1983 (Katz and Murphy 1992), the
sharpest declines in social capital are likely to have occurred from the late 1970s to the the early
1980s. In contrast, trends in neighborhood sorting by income suggest that social capital should
have increased from 1970 to 1990. If cars and local television and newspapers have effectively
expanded the size of people’s communities then inequality trends in the entire metropolitan area
may be more important predictors of social capital trends than trends in neighborhood measures.

14

4.2 Social Capital Trends
By some measures social capital has declined and by others it has not. Consider first the trend in
the proportion of 25 to 54 year olds volunteering in the past year (see Figure 1). In the CPS the
fraction who did any volunteer work in the past year fell from 29 percent in 1974 to 26 percent in
1989. Volunteer rates are higher in the DDB data and show that the fraction of married men and
women with any volunteer activity in the past year fell by 3 percentage points in the 1970s, but by
1998 was back at its 1975 level. The Independent Sector survey shows a decline in volunteering in
the 1990s, but not from 1988 to 1996. The NPD data show that from 1992 to 1998 the proportion
reporting any volunteer activity in a given day remained constant, but fell in 1999. When we
examined time spent volunteering conditional on being a volunteer, we found increases in the
CPS data and no change in the DDB data.5
There have been declines in the proportion of 25 to 54 year olds who are members of
organizations (see Figure 2). Membership in non-church organizations fell slightly from 1952
to 1972. Trends in the 1952 and 1972 interval are harder to establish, because, as discussed in
the Data Appendix, the 1967 survey may overestimate membership relative to the other surveys.
All of the political surveys underestimate membership relative to the GSS. The GSS shows that
membership in all organizations fell from 77 to 72 percent between 1974 and 1994. The decline in
church groups was highest, falling from 40 to 31 percent between 1974 and 1994. Membership in
professional groups rose from 15 to 23 percent. The total decline in non-church memberships was
only 1 percentage point. The fraction reporting spending any time during the day in organizational
activity first rose slightly from its level of 8 percent in 1965 but by 1985 fell to 5 percent.

5

Among volunteers participation in church groups was the most common form of volunteer activity in both 1974
and 1989 (for 41 and 36 percent, respectively, of individuals). The second and third most popular volunteer activities
were participation in civic and political groups and in recreational groups in 1974 and in school and education groups
and civic and political groups in 1989.

an individual participated in any organizational activity during one 24 hour day and is from the 1965, 1975, and 1985
time use studies.

17

The sharpest declines in social capital are for entertainment and the family eating dinner
together (see Figure 3). Among married individuals age 25 to 54 in the DDB data, the proportion
reporting that the family eats dinner together fell from 44% in 1977 to 26% in 1998. The fraction
reporting entertaining at home at least 12-24 times in the past year fell from 41 percent in 1975
to 20 percent in 1998. The fraction of all men and women in the same age group visiting with
friends or going to parties in a 24 hour period fell from 41 percent in 1965 to 27 percent in 1985.
The fraction reporting visiting friends or relatives in a 24 hour period in the NPD data fell from
23 percent in 1992 to 21 percent in 1999. The fraction in the General Social Survey reporting
spending more than one social evening once a month with neighbors fell from 43 percent in 1974
to 30 percent in 1998. However, there was no decline in the fraction reporting spending a social
evening more than once a month with relatives or friends.

Results

We have shown that there have been small declines in the proportion of Americans reporting any
time spent volunteering or any organizational membership and there have been large declines in
the proportion visiting friends and relatives. We now run regressions of the form of Equations
1 through 3 to examine whether these declines persist when we control for basic demographic
characteristics, differential trends by education, differential trends by sex, and community heterogeneity.

5.1 Volunteering
Table 5 shows that controlling for demographic characteristics the probability of volunteering
fell by 0.05 between 1974 and 1989 and that the decline in volunteering was twice as large
among women as among men and disappeared among men and was halved among women once

we controlled for metropolitan area wage inequality. When we examined social capital trends
by individual characteristics more closely we found that social capital declined only among
married women, not among single women. We found no differential trends in social capital by
education among men, but among women we found increases among the married college-educated
and decreases among the single college-educated. Examining community characteristics more
closely showed that neither the neighborhood sorting index nor the racial isolation index affected
the time trend, although the latter was statistically significant. A growing metropolitan area
employment rate was a statistically insignificant predictor of volunteering and did not affect the
trend, suggesting that we are not simply measuring the effects of the business cycle. Instrumenting
for Gini with the manufacturing and public administration shares yields similar coefficients, but
the standard error on Gini becomes very large and the coefficient statistically insignificant.
Although a Hausman test rejected endogeneity (2(25)

=

0:36), the results are inconclusive

because of the size of the standard error. We also found that conditional on volunteering,
time spent volunteering increased controlling for demographic and community characteristics.
Among volunteers community characteristics are small and statistically insignificant determinants
of volunteer time.
The DDB data show that volunteering was statistically significantly higher in the 1970s
than in the late 1990s, but that there were no statisically significant differences in metropolitan
areas (see Table 6). Neither changing community characteristics nor differential trends by
individual characteristics affect the time trend, even though the Gini coefficient was a strong
predictor of volunteering.6 We cannot detect a trend in the NPD data even controlling for
demographic characteristics.
The Gini coefficient was the community characteristic that best predicts volunteering

6

When we instrument for Gini we obtain a large but statistically insignificant coefficient of -0.770 but the time
trend remains unchanged.

errors in parentheses. The symbols , y, and z indicate significance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent level, respectively. The dependent
variable is a dummy equal to one if the individual did any volunteer work in the past 12 months. Additional control variables
include 5 year age dummies (with age 35-40 as the omitted variable), a dummy indicating that race is white, education dummies
(less than high school, high school, some college, college, post-college, with less than high school as the omitted variable), and
9 regional dummies (New England is omitted). We cannot control for the number of children in the household. Community
heterogeneity measures are interpolated from the 1970 and 1980 censuses for the 1974 sample and are from the 1990 census
for the 1989 sample. Controlling for MSA population and for the average MSA wage did not change the results. In the
rightmost column IV results are reported. Instruments were the share of workers in manufacturing and in public administration.
Estimation was by means of Amemiya’s Generalized Least Squares estimates for probits with endogenous variables using the
formulas in Newey (1987). The first stage results yield an R2 of 0.692 with a coefficient on manufacturing share of -0.142
(ˆ = 0:002) and a coefficient on public administration share of -0.185 (ˆ = 0:002).

35,845 observations in the entire dataset and 32,577 when MSA is identified. Robust standard errors in parentheses.
The symbols , y, and z indicate significance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent level, respectively. The dependent variable is
whether the individualdid any volunteer work in the past 12 months. The fragmentation measures and the neighborhood
segregegation index for 1970, 1980, and 1980 were used for the decades of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, respectively.
The Gini coefficient is an annual measure. It was interpolated across census years and predicted for the 1990s.
Additional control variables include a dummy equal to one if there are children at home under age 18, 5 year age
dummies (with age 35-40 as the omitted variable), a dummy indicating that race is white, education dummies (less
than high school, high school, some college, college, post-college, with less than high school as the omitted variable),
and 9 regional dummies (New England is omitted). The DDB data is restricted to married individuals and is weighted
using the population weights.

22

among those age 25 to 54, but among those older than 64 birthplace fragmentation was the best
predictor in both the CPS and the DDB. Although it did not affect volunteering trends, ethnic
fragmentation may be more important to seniors. Controlling for demographic characteristics,
there was no statistically significant change in the CPS in seniors’ probability of volunteering and
in the DDB volunteering first increased in the 1980s and early 1990s and then decreased.

5.2 Memberships
We predicted that because wage inequality rose only slightly between 1952 and 1972, membership trends should remain unchanged. We found that this was true for non-church membership in
metropolitan areas (see Table 7). In metropolitan areas racial fragmentation was the only community characteristic that was a statistically significant predictor of membership, but membership
increased (though not stastically significantly) despite sharply rising racial fragmentation. The
effect of the Gini coefficient was large, but statistically insignificant.
Since the 1970s rising income inequality and growing birthplace fragmentation have
been the primary determinants of declining organization membership controlling for education
(see Table 8).7 The Gini coefficient and birthplace fragmentation combined decreased the coefficients on the year dummies for 1984-89 and 1990-4 from -0.07 to -0.05 and from -0.11 to -0.08,
respectively.8 Membership declined sharply in the early 1980s relative to the 1970s, precisely
mirroring the sharp increase in inequality, but then remained relatively level. The Gini coefficient
was a particularly important predictor for membership in sports, youth, church, literary, and hobby
clubs, but not of professional organizations, suggesting that when interpersonal contact is high,
people prefer to be with others like them. Neighborhood sorting had little effect on member-

7

Not controlling for education leads to somewhat smaller declines. Examining only non-church membership
yields smaller but still significant declines. Excluding union membership does not affect the magnitude of the decline.

When we instrumented for Gini we obtained an insignificant coefficient of -1.607.

ship trends. Among Americans older than 64 we found that again birthplace fragmentation was
the only community characteristic that statistically significantly predicted membership but that
there was no statistically significant change in membership since the 1970s. When we examined
trends by individual characteristics we found no differential trend between women and men or
the college-educated and those with less than a college education. However, when we restricted
the sample to women we found a statistically significant and substantial increase in membership
among the college-educated, largely because of an increase in professional memberships.
The time use diaries provide evidence that the rise in women’s labor force participation
rates has reduced time spent in organizational activity (see Table 9). When the sample was
restricted to men, we found no evidence of a time trend. When we restricted to women we found
that the probability of spending time in organizational activity first rose by 0.02 between 1965 and
1975 and then fell by 0.063 by 1985. We also found that being in the labor force was a statistically
significant, negative predictor of membership. Although most of the decline in membership was
observed among non-working women, this may reflect selection or the shift of memberships from
community-oriented to workplace-oriented.

5.3 Entertaining and Visiting
Among married 25 to 54 year olds the probability of entertaining at home at least 12 to 24 times
in the past year fell sharply between 1975 and 1998, with the largest declines among women
(see Table 10). When we restricted the sample to women then we found that the biggest declines
have occurred among women who are in the labor force. Among Americans older than 64 there
was also a decline in the probability of entertaining, but there were no statistically significant
differences between men and women. As expected, community characteristics (with the exception
of a positive and significant sign on birthplace fragmentation) were statistically insignificant and
did not affect the trend. When we examined the probability of the family eating dinner together

Restricted to individuals in MSAs. 32,577 observations. Robust standard errors in parentheses. The symbols , y,
and z indicate significance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent level, respectively. The fragmentation measures calculated from
the 1970, 1980, and 1990 census were used for the decades of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, respectively. The Gini
coefficient is an annual measure. It was interpolated across census years and predicted for the 1990s. The dependent
variable is equal to one if the individual reported entertaining at home at least 12-24 times in the last 12 months.
Additional control variables include a dummy equal to one if there are children at home under age 18, 5 year age
dummies (with age 35-40 as the omitted variable), a dummy indicating that race is white, education dummies (less than
high school, high school, some college, college, post-college, with less than high school as the omitted variable), and 9
regional dummies (New England is omitted). The DDB data is restricted to married individuals only. All regressions
are weighted using population weights. Controlling for MSA size did not change the results.

we found no differential trends by sex nor by labor force status among women nor any effect of
community characteristics on the time trend
The time use studies also reveal differential trends between men and women in time
spent visiting (see Tables 11 and 12). Between 1965 and 1975 the probability of visiting friends
or being at parties fell by 0.10 among women but by only 0.05 among men. Between 1965 and
1985 the probability among women fell by 0.25 and among men by 0.13. The 1965 to 1985 decline
between men and women was statistically significantly different. However, unlike the DDB data,
the 1965-1985 time diaries show that the biggest decline occurred among non-working women.

16,128 observations. 7,965 men and 8,163 women. The symbols , y, and z indicate significance at the 10, 5, and 1
percent level, respectively. The dependent variable is equal to one if the individual reported any time spent visiting
friends or family members. Additional control variables include dummies equal to one if the individual is married,
lives in a metropolitan area, is white, is hispanic, moved recently, or has children under 18 in the household, 5 year
age dummies (with age 35-40 as the omitted variable), education dummies (less than high school, high school, some

Selection is a potential explanation. Compared to 1992 women’s probability of visiting friends or
relatives was substantially (and statistically significantly) lower in each year after 1995, whereas
men experienced little change. There was no differential trend by labor force participation status
among women. Among Americans older than 64 there were no statistically significant changes
in the probability of visiting friends and relatives in the 1990s.
Using the GSS we found that controlling for demographic characteristics there was no
decline in men’s or women’s probability of spending a social evening with friends or relatives
at least several times a month. (These findings do not necessarily contradict those from the
time diaries – the phrasing of the questions in the time diaries may have led some to only count
entertainment at home.) There was a significant decline in both men’s and women’s probabilities
of spending a social evening with a neighbor at least several times a month, but this could neither
be explained by differential trends between men and women or between the college-educated and
the less than college-educated nor by rising metropolitan area heterogeneity. Our findings of no
decline in the probability of spending a social evening with a friend suggests that although formal
entertainment in the home has fallen, men and women still maintain contact with their friends.

5.4 Summary
We have shown that where there have been declines in social capital controlling for education,
rising community heterogeneity (particularly income inequality) explains the decline in social
capital produced outside the home whereas the rise in women’s labor force participation rates
explains the decline in social capital produced in the home. Sixty-four percent of the decline in
the predicted probability of volunteering between 1974 and 1989 was due to the decline among
women and 36 percent to the decline among men, suggesting that women’s rising labor force
participation rates account for 28 percent of the predicted decline. Rising income inequality
accounts for all of the decline among men and half of the predicted decline among women.
31

Rising birthplace fragmentation explains 18 percent of the predicted decline in membership from
1974 to 1994 and rising income inequality another 20 percent. The remaining 62 percent was
unexplained. Although women’s rising participation rates do not explain trends in membership,
they account for roughly 65 percent of the decline in time spent in organizational activity between
1965 and 1985. (The remaining 35 percent was unexplained.) Fifty-nine percent of the predicted
decline in entertaining frequently at home between 1975 and 1998 was due to women and 41
percent was due to men. About 70 percent of the predicted daily decline in spending time visiting
friends or at parties between 1965 and 1985 was due to women and 30 percent was due to men and
all of the predicted daily decline in visiting friends or relatives in the 1990s was due to women.
Women’s rising labor force participation rates therefore explain 18 to 100 percent of the predicted
declines. We could not explain the predicted decline in spending a social evening with a neighbor
nor the predicted decline in time spent with children. We found no evidence that growing sprawl,
television, or increases in work hours by the college-educated played any role in the decline.
Why do our results differ from those of Putnam (2000)? Putnam concluded that up to
half of the decline in social capital controlling for education was due to the aging of the civic
generation and up to one quarter to television. We presented results by year not by cohort because
our datasets span such different years. When we examined the probability of volunteering at age
34 to 48 in the CPS, we found that controlling for demographic characteristics and education the
probability of volunteering was lower by 0.08 among the cohort born 1941 to 1955 compared
to members of the civic generation born 1926 to 1940. Once we controlled for rising income
inequality, this decline was halved. Averaging over our measures of social capital centered in the
community we attribute roughly one third of the predicted decline to women’s increased labor
force participation rates and one half to growing community heterogeneity. Averaging over our
measures of social capital centered in the home we find that the rise in women’s labor force
participation rates explains 40 percent of the predicted decline. The aging of the civic generation

32

and television could therefore account for at most 22 to 60 percent of the decline. Our results
also show that the exact decomposition depends upon the type of social capital that is examined
and upon the data sources used.

6

Conclusion

We have examined trends in social capital produced both inside the community and inside the
home and have found that since the 1970s there have been small declines in the probability of
volunteering, larger declines in the probability of being a member of a group, and still larger
declines in the probability of entertaining at home. There have been no declines in the probability
of spending frequent evenings with friends or relatives, but time diaries suggest that the probability of visiting friends or relatives has fallen. We argued that the most important explanation
for declines in social capital centered in the home was the growth of women’s labor force participation whereas the most important factor explaining the decline in social capital centered in
the community was rising income inequality, but that growing ethnic heterogeneity and growing
women’s labor force participation rates played roles as well.
Our findings have implications not just for the United States, but for other countries as
well. Both high income inequality and low ethnic homogeneity predicts low membership across
western European countries (see Figure 4). The fraction of the population participating actively in
a group is very high in such countries as Norway, Sweden, and Finland, and Germany, all of which
have relatively low income inequality and high ethnic homogeneity. Although membership rates
have been rising in most western European countries, our findings suggest that in the future they
will fall. Immigration into western Europe from eastern Europe and from developing countries
has increased. As labor markets become more competitive income inequality may rise in Europe
as well.

Figure 4: Participation and Income Inequality and Ethnic Homogeneity Across Western Europe,
1981-1997

Note. Estimated from World Values Surveys and European Values Surveys, 1981-1984, 1990-1993, 1995-1997
(Inglehart et al. (2000)). Participation rates are for all adults and are averaged across all survey years. The Gini coefficients are from Measuring Income Inequality: A New Database (Deininger and Squire, http://www.worldbank.org).
Note that other studies have found that inequality in the UK and in Spain is closer to the levels observed in Portugal
(e.g. Ercolani and Jenkins 1998). However, for consistency we use Gini coefficients from one database. Ethnic
homogeneity indexes are from Knack and Keefer (1997).

34

How concerned should we be about declines in social capital? The macro-economic
consequences of low social capital levels to countries have been extensively documented (e.g.
La Porta et al. 1997, Knack and Keefer 1997, Easterly and Levine 1997, Guiso et al. 2000).
The absence of social capital may explain why redistribution is lower in more heterogeneous
communities (Poterba 1997; Luttmer, forthcoming). It also explains why volunteering and membership in community organizations is lower in more heterogenous communities. Communities
may therefore face declines both in time and money inputs. In this case, even if money and time
were perfect substitutes in the production of public goods, there would be little possibility of
“offsetting” the lost social capital using public funds. Fortunately, the declines in social capital
centered within the community in the United States are relatively small. The large declines in
social capital centered within the home imply that the socialization of children will become harder.

This appendix describes both our social capital variables, our community heterogeneity variables,
and our demographic variables.
Volunteering Questions
1. Current Population Survey, April 1974.
During the past 12 months, from May 1973 through April 1974, have you done ANY
UNPAID volunteer work for a group such as those listed above or any other type of
organization?
About how many hours of unpaid volunteer work did you do during this 12-month period?
(intervalled)
Did you do ANY UNPAID volunteer work during the week of April 7-13, 1974?
How many hours did you work for (type of group)?
2. Current Population Survey, May 1989.
Last week, about how many hours of unpaid volunteer work did ... do?
Even though ... did not do any unpaid volunteer work last week, did ... do any unpaid
volunteer work over the past 12 months?
Approximately how many hours of unpaid volunteer work did ... do over the past 12
months?
In how many weeks did ... do any unpaid volunteer work over the past 12 months?
Annual volunteer work hours
3. Giving and Volunteering the United States, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996, Gallup Organization for Independent Sector.
Listed on this card are examples of the many different areas in which people do volunteer
activity. By volunteer activity I mean not just belonging to a service organization, but
actually working in some way to help others for no monetary pay. In which, if any, of the
areas listed on this card have you done some volunteer work in the past twelve months?
Did not volunteer in past 12 months to any charities
4. DDB Life Style Survey, 1975-1998.
Did volunteer work (freq last 12 months)?
Our variable consists of whether an individual did any volunteer work in the past 12
months. We also constructed an intervalled annual total hours volunteered variable from the CPS.
As previously noted, differences in volunteering rates arise from differences in response rates,
36

survey methodology, and the types of questions asked. Response rates in the Current Population
Survey in 1974 and 1989 were roughly 95 percent (see Handbook of Labor Statistics.) In contrast,
response rates to the Gallup survey were roughly 20 percent.9 Surveys other than the CPS may
overstate the extent of volunteering because only more civic minded individuals may be willing
to answer questions that do not come from the Census Bureau. The CPS may underestimate
the extent of volunteering because the CPS used proxy respondents (who were significantly less
likely to report volunteer activity than respondents representing only themselves), because of
uncertainty on the part of respondents as to precisely what types of activities were volunteer
activities, and because the question may have been insufficiently detailed to prompt recall of
marginal or infrequent volunteer activity (Hayghe 1991).
Membership Questions
1. American National Election Study, 1952. I have a list here of different kinds of clubs and
organizations that people belong to. I would like you to go over this list with me and tell
me if you belong to any organizations like a labor union, a lodge, a veterans’ organization
and so on.
The interviewer probed for additional groups, but separate questions were not used to ask
about specific groups. Membership in political organizations was a separate question. Our
constructed variable consists of any mention of membership in either a political, formal, or
informal group or organization, except for church connected groups.
2. American National Election Study, 1972. Here is a list of some kinds of organizations to
which people may belong. Just tell me the letter on the card of any type of organization
that you belong to. If you belong to any that are not on this list, tell me about those too.
The organizations on the list were fraternal lodges, professional groups, farm organizations,
church or religious groups, neighborhood associations, social or card-playing groups, athletic clubs or teams, cooperatives, political clubs or organizations, charity or social welfare
organizations, veterans’ organizations, civic groups, special interest groups or lobbies, ethnic associations, labor unions, and other. Our constructed variable consists of membership
in all groups.

Personal communication from the Independent Sector. The other surveys have better response rates. Response
rates to the DDB was roughly 70 to 80 percent (Putnam 2000: 421) and those to the NPD were roughly 60 percent
(personal communication from The NPD Group).

37

3. General Social Survey, 1974-1994.
We would like to know about the groups and organizations to which individuals belong.
Here is a list of various kinds of organizations. Could you tell me whether or not you are a
member of each type?
The groups listed were fraternal groups, service clubs, veterans’ groups, political clubs,
labor unions, sports groups, youth groups, school service groups, hobby or garden clubs,
school fraternities or sororities, nationality groups, farm organizations, literary, art, discussion or study groups, professional or academic societies, church-affiliated groups, other
groups. This question was asked in 1974, 1975, 1977, 1978, 1980, 1983, 1984, 1986, 1987,
1988, 1990, 1991, 1993, and 1994. Our constructed variable consists of membership in
any group.
4. The Five Nation Study, 1960.
Are you a member of any organizations now – trade or labor unions, business organizations, social groups, professional or farm organizations, cooperatives (not applicable to US),
fraternal or veterans’ groups, athletic clubs, political, charitable, civil or religious organizations – or any other organized group. Our constructed variable consists of membership
in any group other than religious.
5. Political Participation in America, 1967.
Now we would like to know something about the groups and organizations to which individuals belong. Here is a list of various kinds of organizations. Could you tell me if you
belong to any of these kinds?
The groups listed were fraternal groups, service clubs, veterans’ groups, political groups,
labor unions, sports groups, youth groups, school service groups, hobby or garden clubs,
school fraternities or sororities, nationality groups, farm organizations, literary, art, discussion, or study clubs, professional or academic societies, and other. Our constructed
variables consists of membership in any groups.
Except for the GSS, we examine only non-church group membership because of differences in phrasing (e.g. membership in a church choir may be treated as membership in a
church-affiliated group, but not in a church or religious group) and because there is some evidence of a context effect on church membership in the GSS (Smith 1990).
When we compare membership in unions in the GSS and the political participation
surveys, we find that the GSS most closely matches data on union membership from the Bureau
of Labor Statistics and from the Current Population Survey (see Figure 5). The 1952 and 1972
National Election Studies follow the trend closely, but underestimate union membership. The

38

1967 survey is off of the trend line.
Daily Activities
1. Americans’ Use of Time, 1954-1965, 1985 and Time Use in Economic and Social Accounts
Our constructed organizational activity variable is based upon an individual records any
minutes spent in 1) participating as member of a party, union, etc.; 2) voluntary activity
as an elected official of an organization; other organizational participation; 3) volunteer
work for a civic purpose; 4) participating as member of a religious club; 5) participating in
factory or worker’s councils or committees (union-management); 6) participating in other
organizations (family, parent, military, etc.); and, 7) other. We do not include religious
practice or attending church services or ceremonies in our definition. Our entertainment
activity variable is based upon 1) entertaining friends or visiting friends, 2) party or reception
(with meals) given by or for R, and 3) party or reception, without meals; other social life.
2. The NPD Group Time Study Data, 1992-1999.
Our volunteering variable is based upon whether an individual records in any half hour
interval that time spent in volunteer work was the primary activity. Our entertainment
variable is based upon time spent visiting family/friends.
Entertaining and Socializing
1. DDB Life Style Survey, 1975-1998.
Our constructed variable of high frequency in entertaining is based upon whether an individual reported that he or she “entertained people in my home” 12-24 times in the last 12
months.
2. General Social Survey, 1974-1998.
Would you use this card and tell me which answer comes closest to how often you do the
following things ... A. Spend a social evening with relatives? B. Spend a social evening
with someone who lives in your neighborhood? C. Spend a social evening with friends
who live outside the neighborhood?
This question was asked in 1974, 1975, 1977, 1978, 1982, 1988, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1994,
1996, and 1998. Our constructed variable of high frequency in socializing is based upon
whether an individual reported a frequency of several times a month or more.
Metropolitan Area Characteristics
1. Gini coefficient. We calculated, by metropolitan area and census year, the gini coefficient
of weekly wages of men age 21 to 64 working at least 35 hours a week in the census week
and at least 52 weeks a year in the past year. Weekly wage is estimated as last year’s income
divided by the number of weeks worked in the past year.

Figure 5: Union Membership, 1948-1998

Note. GSS=General Social Survey, 1974-1998. The Electoral Surveys consist of the 1952 and 1972 American
National Election Studies, the 1960 Five Nation Study, and the 1967 Political Participation in America. BLS/CPS
refers to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and from the Current Population Survey reproduced from Figure
10.9 in Goldin (2000). Unionization rates are estimated for all non-agricultural members of the labor force.

2. Racial fragmentation. We calculated, by metropolitan area and census year, the fraction of
whites, blacks, American Indians, asians, and other.
3. Birthplace fragmentation. We calculated, by metropolitan area, the fraction of individuals
born in the United States, Puerto Rico, Latin America, Cuba, white, English speaking nations, Scandinavia, northern Europe, southern Europe, eastern Europe, east Asia, southeast
Asia, the Mideast, Africa, and other.
4. Manufacturing and Public Administration Shares. We calculate, by metropolitan area
and census year, the fraction of the labor force employed in manufacturing and in public
administration and use these variables as instruments for the Gini coefficient. and man
5. Neighborhood Sorting Index. We use Jargowsky’s (1996) measures of income segregation
by neighborhood within metropolitan areas.
6. Racial Isolation Index. We use Culter, Glaeser, and Vigdor’s (1999) measures of racial
isolation neighborhood within metropolitan areas.
The first four metropolitan area characteristics are estimated from the Integrated Public
Use Census Samples for 1950, 1970, 1980, and 1990 (Ruggles and Sobek 1997).
Demographic Variables
1. Education. Education refers to highest level of education completed.
2. Marital status. In DDB Life Style Survey only married individuals were questioned prior
to 1985. Because information is not provided on marital status in 1986, 1988, 1989, and
1990 those years are excluded from the analysis.
3. Age. Age is generally given as age in years. It is intervalled in the 1960 Five Nation Study
(18-25, 26-30, 31-35, 36-40, 41-50, 51-60, and 60+) and 1992-1992 The NPD Group Time
Study (Under 25, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-64, 65+).
