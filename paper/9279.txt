ABSTRACT
We argue that takeovers have played a major role in speeding up the diffusion of new
technology. The role that they play is similar to that of entry and exit of firms. We focus on and
compare two periods: 1890-1930 during which electricity and the internal combustion engine spread
through the U.S. economy, and 1971-2001 . the Information Age.

Abstract
We argue that takeovers have played a major role in speeding up the diffusion of new technology. The role that they play is similar to that of entry
and exit of Þrms. We focus on and compare two periods: 1890-1930 during
which electricity and the internal combustion engine spread through the U.S.
economy, and 1971-2001 — the Information Age.

Introduction

It has been said that new technology replaces and therefore “destroys” old technology.
But if we think further about the process by which this replacement takes place,
it becomes clear that much of “creative destruction” would more aptly be named
reallocation. In trying to adopt a new technology, a Þrm may re-train some of its
workers and replace others, and it can re-Þt its buildings and equipment, where
possible, and replace the rest. If it fails in the attempt to reorganize internally, the
Þrm will probably disappear and its assets will be reorganized externally. In that
case the Þrm will either liquidate, or it will be taken over. Either way, however, the
existing human and physical capital is no more likely to be “destroyed” than during an
episode of internal reorganization. It will simply change management. Indeed, a new
technology cannot spread quickly economy-wide unless these reallocation mechanisms
work smoothly. This paper studies these mechanisms.
We study and measure, in particular, the two external adjustment mechanisms
— mergers and entry-and-exit (E&E) — using the stock-market capitalization of the
Þrms involved. In Figure 1, the U-shaped top line is our estimate of the total amount
of capital that has been reallocated on the U.S. stock market over the past 112
years. Its components are the stock market capitalization of entering and exiting

We identify targets for 1926-2001 using the stock Þles distributed by the University of Chicago’s
Center for Research on Securities Prices (CRSP) and various supplementary sources. We use worksheets for the manufacturing and mining sectors that underlie Nelson (1959) for 1890-1930. The
target series includes the market values of exchange-listed Þrms in the year prior to their acquisition, and reßects 9,030 mergers. Stock market capitalizations after 1925 are from CRSP. Prior to
that they are from our extension of CRSP backward through 1885 using contemporary newspapers.
Entries and exits are also drawn from CRSP and our newspaper sources. Before assigning a Þrm
as an “exit” we check the list of hostile takeovers from Schwert (2000) for 1975-1996 and individual
issues of the Wall Street Journal from 1997-2001 to ensure that we record Þrms taken private under
a hostile tender oﬀers as mergers. See footnotes 1 and 4 of Jovanovic and Rousseau (2001) for a
detailed description of these data and their sources.

line, is a rough measure of how much capital exits from the stock market and comes
back in under diﬀerent ownership, or at least under a diﬀerent name. The lower line
is the stock-market value of merger targets.
The bottom panel shows the Þve merger waves and at the very top we list the
names most commonly given to these waves.2 This paper will argue, however, that
the Þrst two waves represent a form of external reallocation of resources in response to
the simultaneous arrival of two general purpose technologies (GPTs) — electricity and
(to a lesser extent) internal combustion — and that the last two represent reallocation
in response to the arrival of the microcomputer and information technology (IT). The
middle “Managerial Hubris” wave was composed mainly of conglomerate mergers and
does not seem to Þt our story. Two speciÞc points emerge in Figure 1:
1. Each merger wave was accompanied by a rise in E&E. The deviations from
trend are positively related — the correlation is 0.46.
2. Total reallocation has no signiÞcant trend, but mergers have grown relative to
E&E — the ratio rises by a factor of 9, from 0.18 in the 1890’s to 1.63 in the
1990’s.
Fact 1 arises, we argue, because society will use both margins of external adjustment in response to a technological shock. Fact 2 arises, we believe, because of the
increased importance of teamwork and organization capital which also has caused
market values of companies to rise relative to their book values.
Our contrast of two periods of major technological change — electriÞcation (18901930) and IT (1970-2002) is in the spirit of David (1991).

Model

First we describe a standard one-technology “Ak” model; we then add a second
technology with its own capital that suddenly and unexpectedly becomes available.

We deÞne the shaded merger “waves” as starting when the series for target value stays above a

The wave “ends” when the series falls below trend for two consecutive years.

This model has no transitional dynamics because it has a single state variable, k.

2.2

A second technology arrives

Starting from a state in which all its capital embodies a technology z1 , how does the
economy transit to a state in which all its capital embodies technology z2 ? If the
arrival of z2 at t = 0 was unexpected, the growth rate before the transition would
have been (z1 − δ − ρ) /σ, and after the transition is over at date T the growth rate
will be (z2 − δ − ρ) /σ. For the intervening T periods, two kinds of capital coexist,
k1 and k2 . This is the era of reallocation.
De novo investment and upgrading New capital can be produced from the
consumption good, or from old capital.
De novo entry of k2 .–As is usual in one-sector growth models, the production
function for new capital (not counting depreciation) is
kú 2 = x2

(1)

where x2 is the consumption foregone for the purpose of creating k2 .
Two technologies for converting k1 into k2 or into c.–We shall model these upgrading costs as convex costs of adjustment. We assume two distinct upgrading
activities, one of which involves only k1 while the other requires both k1 and k2 . The
intuition is easiest if we imagine that k1 and k2 must reside in diﬀerent Þrms — call
these z1 -Þrms and z2 -Þrms
1. Conversion via “Exit”. Let ∆1 be amount of k1 that the z1 -Þrms retire and
convert into an equal number, ∆1 , of units of the consumption good. In so
doing, they forego
µ ¶
∆1
ψ

units of output. Assume that ψ is increasing, convex and diﬀerentiable with
ψ 0 (0) = 0. This adjustment cost is homogeneous of degree 1 in (∆1 , k1 ).

2. Conversion via “Acquisition”. Let ∆2 be the total amount of k1 that the z2 Þrms acquire from z1 -Þrms and convert into ∆2 units of k2 . In so doing, they
forego

∆2
φ
k2
k2
units of output. Assume that φ is increasing, convex and diﬀerentiable with
φ0 (0) = 0. This adjustment cost is homogeneous of degree 1 in (∆2 , k2 ).

Output and the evolution of k1 and k2 . During the transition, t ∈ [0, T ], both
k1 and k2 are used. Net of upgrading costs, output is
y = (z1 − ψ [ε]) k1 + (z2 − φ [m]) k2 ,
where

(2)

∆1
k1

ε≡
is the exit rate of k1 , and

∆2
k2
is the acquisitions rate relative to k2 . Consumption is
m=

c = y − x1 − x2 .
The two capital stocks evolve as follows:
kú 1 = −δk1 + x1 − (εk1 + mk2 )
kú 2 = −δk2 + x2 + εk1 + mk2

(3)
(4)

These two laws of motion are standard but for the reallocation term εk1 + mk2 , which
is subtracted from the right-hand side of (3) and added back in (4).

2.3

Equilibrium

Equilibrium consists of m, ε, x1 and x2 such that Þrms maximize and such that the
representative agent consumes optimally. The initial conditions are k1,0 = 1, k2,0 =
0, and the aggregate laws of motion (3) and (4) hold with the added restriction
that k1,t ≥ 0. The model has neither external eﬀects nor monopoly power and the
Appendix uses the planner’s problem to derive the equilibrium formally. In this
section we shall give the market-economy interpretation.
Upgrading.–Let q be the price of k1 , and Q the price of k2 . Optimal upgrading
by z1 -Þrms implies that
ψ 0 (ε) = Q − q.
(5)
5

and optimal upgrading by z2 -Þrms implies that
φ0 (m) = Q − q.

(6)

In both cases the replacement cost for k1 is q, and the upgraded capital has a price
of Q. The diﬀerence between the two is equated, in (6) and (5) to the marginal cost
of adjustment.3
Investment.–We assume that x2 > 0. Then
Q = 1.
On the other hand, it will turn out that q < 1 for all t ∈ [t, T ), and therefore x1 = 0
throughout the transition.
Output and upgrading rents.– k1 and k2 play a dual role here. Each produces
output, and each assists in the upgrading process. Upgrading is subject to increasing
marginal costs and so, in equilibrium, entails a rent. The per-unit upgrading rent
that k1 draws is
πε (q) ≡ max {ε − (qε + ψ [ε])} ,
ε

and the per-unit rent that k2 draws is
π m (q) ≡ max {m − (qm + φ [m])} .
m

Consumption growth during the transition is
cú
1
= (z2 + π m (q) − ρ − δ)
c
σ

(7)

and the rate of interest is
r = z2 − δ + π m (q) .
Output in (2) rises monotonically because, by (5) and (6), ε and m both decline
monotonically. This is driven by the monotonic rise in q that we are about to show.
The monotonic rise in q during the transition If we can solve for q, we shall
ú
and r. The price of k1 must be such that
be able to infer ε, m, π ε (q), π m (q), c/c,
the marginal product of k1 equals its user cost:
z1 + π ε (q) = (r − δ) q − q.
ú
Since Qú = 0, the corresponding condition for k2 is
z2 + π m (q) = r − δ.
3

In our partial-equilibrium treatment of takeovers as an investment (Jovanovic and Rousseau
2002), the equivalent of (6) is eq. (8). That paper also assumes adjustment costs on x which we
have suppressed here in order to keep the analysis manageable.

Combining these two conditions and eliminating r we are left with4

(8)

Let q ∗ be the largest value of q at which
z2 + π m (q) =

(z1 + π ε [q])
q

for all t ∈ [0, T ]. Since πm (q) = π ε (q) = 0 when q ≥ 1, we have 0 < q∗ < 1. This
rest-point q ∗ is unstable from above:
q > q∗

=⇒

qú > 0.

But q must approach unity at t → T because as of date T , k1,t becomes zero and εt
and mt must both become zero. That is, since φ0 (0) = 0, a unit of k1 is at date T as
valuable as a unit of k2 because it can be upgraded costlessly. It must therefore be
that
q0 ∈ (q ∗ , 1) and qT = 1

and, from (8), that qú > 0 all through the transition, . Finally, qúT = z2 − z1 . Figure 2
illustrates the solution for qt .

2.4

Summary of implications

The qualitative implications are as follows:
1. At t = 0, output falls from z1 k1 to (z1 − ψ [ε0 ]) k1 and then starts to rise monotonically.
2. The value of capital also falls from 1 to q0 . Wealth falls from k1,0 to q0 k1,0 .
3. Thereafter, qt rises monotonically to 1, and k1 falls monotonically to zero at
date T , as do ε and m.
4. Total exits, qεk1 , decline monotonically, whereas total acquisitions, qmk2 start
and end at zero and are, essentially, inverted U-shaped during the transition.
5. The rate of interest jumps from z1 − δ to z2 − δ + π m (q0 ) and then declines
monotonically to z2 − δ where it remains thereafter.
6. Consumption falls at date zero. After that consumption growth declines monotonically. More precisely,

Parameter choices are reported in Figures 3 and 4. If we assume that discounting is
at a rate of Þve percent per year, the value of ρ = 0.10 determines the period-length
at 2 years. In both of the simulations we have assumed that the new technology
doubles the rate of growth from z1 − ρ = 0.015, or three-quarters of a percent per
year before the transition, to z2 −ρ = 0.03, or 1.5 percent per year after the transition.
The adjustment-cost parameters, µ and ν, are set much higher implying a far smaller
adjustment cost than the micro evidence (see below) suggests. Our main interest is
in how the diﬀusion of the new technology is implemented. The three ways in which
k2 /k1 grows are:
1. Acquisitions. Relative to market capitalization, acquisitions are
M=

qmk2
.
k2 + qk1

(13)

2. Exits. Relative to market capitalization, exit is
E=

qεk1
,
k2 + qk1

(14)

and E must decline on average from ε at t = 0 to zero at date T .
3. De novo investment.
X=

x2
k2 + qkt

These three series are plotted in the upper left panels of Figures 3 and 4. During
the electricity period, exits were several times as important as acquisitions, and this
is the main fact that we obtain in Simulation 1 (Figure 3), along with a transition
that lasts 32 years. If teamwork and organization capital have indeed become more
important and the cost of destroying them has risen, this implies a fall in ν. Simulation
2 (Figure 4) raises the ratio µ/ν by a factor of 10, and although it achieves the needed
substitution of acquisitions for exits, the transition still takes 32 years.
Simulation 1 shows k2 overtaking k1 after 10 years (i.e., 5 periods). When we
raise the adjustment costs in simulation 2, Figure 4 shows that overtaking does not
occur until the 17th year. Since, in Simulation 2, φ and ψ are much higher than
in Simulation 1, it is surprising that we do not see more substitution towards X.
Exits lead acquisitions in both simulations. Finally in the last panel we plot the new
productivity relative to old trend and Þnd that the productivity slowdown lasts about
7 years in both simulations.

Evidence

We begin with our assumption that the transition is technological and that takeovers
and exits are reallocative. First, we know from McGuckin and Ngyen (1995) and
Schoar (2000) that the productivity of acquiring Þrms’ plants falls and that the productivity of the targets’ plants rises following a takeover. Also, Lichtenberg and Siegel
(1987) Þnd that plants changing owners had lower initial levels of productivity and
higher subsequent productivity growth than plants that did not change hands. These
Þndings support our assumption that a takeover implies that k1 is transformed into
the more productive k2 , and that the acquirer faces an adjustment cost.
Second, the trading of used capital is correlated with mergers.
Our model treats M&As like purchases of used capital at the price of q. In fact,
trading in the two kinds of used capital — bundled and disassembled — has moved
together over the last thirty years. Figure 5 shows this fact. It plots acquired capital
and direct purchases of used capital among exchange-listed Þrms as percentages of
their annual investment from 1971 to 2001. We derive the series using all Þrms

12

common to CRSP and Standard and Poor’s Compustat.5 The two series do not
overlap in coverage, and thus if we add them, we have the fraction of investment
spent on used capital. The correlation coeﬃcient between the two series is 0.44.
3.0.1

Acquisitions and sectoral exposure to GPTs

If 1890-1930 and 1970-2002 are technological transitions, then we should have seen
more upgrading and reallocation in the sectors that were absorbing more of the two
GPT’s. Figure 6 reports, for each epoch, a measure of sectoral absorption of the
two GPTs at the tail end of the two episodes. The Þgures are comparable, and are
constrained by the sectoral investment data that we could Þnd for the Þrst epoch.6
The acquisitions that we report are for 1925-30 and 1997-2000 (the waves as deÞned
in Figure 1).7 That is, we look at the growth of the GPT shares over the 10-year
periods and then report acquisitions during the end-of-period wave.
The relation is positive in both epochs, but more so for the electriÞcation era.
The correlation coeﬃcients are 0.74 and 0.22 respectively.
3.0.2

Acquisitions, exits and IPOs by sector

If m and ε are performing the same sort of reallocative function, then they should be
positively correlated over sectors. It turns out that they are. The rank correlations
between IPOs and exits on the one hand and acquisitions on the other, with ranks
based upon the percentage of each in total sector value (with the merger samples as
deÞned in fn. 7) are given below.

Once again, the electricity era seems to Þt the model better.

Capital sales include property, plant, and equipment (Compustat item 107). Acquisitions include
funds used for and costs related to the purchase of another company in the current year or an
acquisition in a prior year that was carried over to the current year (item 129). Investment is the
sum of acquired capital (item 129) and direct capital expenditures (item 128). We compute the
ratios in Figure 5 after summing each data item across active Þrms in each year.
6
The sectors and electricity shares shown in the upper panel of Figure 6 are from David (1991).
7
A good deal of U.S. merger activity took place outside of the stock exchange over the 1890-1930
period, and a sectoral breakdown would not be possible unless we use these oﬀ-exchange transactions.
Panel (a) of Figure 6 therefore uses all targets and sector designations recorded in the worksheets
underlying Nelson (1959), and then divides by the total value of exchange-listed Þrms belonging to
a given sector to form the vertical axis quantities. Panel (b) of Figure 6 reßects activity among
exchange-listed Þrms only.

Acquisitions and exits over time

Now we compare the simulations with the aggregate data. In the upper left panels of
Figures 3 and 4 we simulated M , E, and X, and now we look at their actual behavior.
Figure 7 is the empirical counterpart.
Acquisitions should be inverted-U in that a merger wave must begin and end at
zero. Figure 7 shows that mergers crest during the second half of each transition.
Since k1 is decreasing, total exits should fall over the transition. Figure 7 shows
that exits have a slight negative trend, though the T-statistics in a regressions of exits
on trend are only 1.27 for the electricity era and 0.90 for the IT era.
We also simulated X in Figures 3 and 4, but in practice we do not know the
investment for Þrms that actually traded on the stock market. For the economy as
a whole, investment net of residential structures averaged 10.5% of GDP for 18901930 and 11.5% for 1970-2001.8 Of course, these shares are much higher than in our
simulations, but the units are not the same. If the aggregate capital stock was about
three times nominal output from 1890-1930 and about two and a half times output
from 1970-2001, we can divide each average by these multiples to express investment
as shares of stock market capitalization, assuming of course that listed Þrms form their
capital stocks in the same way as unlisted ones. The resulting investment shares of
3.5% for 1890-1930 and 4.6% for 1970-2001 are much closer to the simulations. Panel
(b) of Figure 7 shows the upward trend in investment that the model predicts for the
transitions, but panel (a) does not.
3.0.4

A rising q

Using the average market-to-book ratios of exiting and target Þrms as a proxy for q,
panel (a) of Figure 8 shows that q has been rising during the IT episode. But so has
Q when measured as the average market-to-book values of acquirers, and this ßatly
contradicts the implication that Q = 1.9 The model could explain values of Q in

We obtain private domestic Þxed investment and its price deßator for 1970-2001 from the August
2002 issue of the Survey of Current Business (Table 1, pp. 123-4, and Table 3, pp. 135-6) and exclude
non-farm residential investment. We use Kendrick (1961, Table A-IIa, column 7) for 1890-1930, and
then subtract residential nonfarm construction from worksheets underlying Kuznets (1961, Table
T-11).

We use the Compustat Þles to compute Þrm q’s, and deÞne market value as the sum of common
equity at current share prices (the product of items 24 and 25), the book value of preferred stock
(item 130), and short- and long-term debt (items 34 and 9). Book values are computed similarly,
but use the book value of common equity (item 60) rather than the market value.
Since the company coverage within Compustat is very thin before 1972, we begin to compute
Q’s at this time. We count Þrms that disappear from Compustat as targets or exits, but only if the
Þrm has been on the Þles for at least two years. Thus, the series for q̄ and q̄/Q begin in 1974. We
omitted q’s for Þrms with negative values for net common equity from the plot since they imply
negative market to book ratios, and eliminated observations with market-to-book values in excess
of 100, since many of these were likely to be serious data errors.

loses its simplicity and results are hard to prove. Moreover, a part of the rise in both
q and Q may be due to the rising importance of unmeasured components of k2 which
are not on the Þrms’ books. It is better, therefore, to concentrate on the ratio q/Q.
In the theory, Q is unity and so

The theory predicts a monotonic rise in this ratio. Panel (b) of Figure 8 shows that
the ratio has indeed risen, but much faster than the simulations in the third panel of

Other evidence and puzzles

In this section we report other, less favorable evidence, and other material that is
somehow incongruous with the model and the logic.
4.0.5

The secular rise of acquisitions relative to exit and entry

Figure 1 shows a nine-fold increase in the ratio of acquisitions to E&E. We do not
explain the trend here, but we can re-formulate the puzzle in terms of our two adjustment costs. Assume they are quadratic as in (9). Then (6) and (5) read m = µ (1 − q)
and ε = ν (1 − q) . Note that
m
µ
= .
ε
ν
If, for some reason, the ratio ν/µ were to fall, ε would fall relative to m. The ninefold rise in the ratio of mergers to E&E over the past century suggests that the ratio
µ/ν has risen by an order of magnitude over this period (which is also the diﬀerence
between the Þrst and the second simulations in Figures 3 and 4). “Team capital” or
“organization capital” may today be more important than it was in 1900, and this
makes it worthwhile to preserve the healthy parts of an underperforming Þrm and Þx
only the part that works poorly. If a Þrm is taken over, its teams and its organization
can remain intact, whereas if it were to exit through bankruptcy its assets and people
will disperse, and this will destroy its team-speciÞc capital.
4.0.6

The stock-market drop

Initial stock-market capitalization is k1 . Right after the shock, it falls to qk1 . With
k1 = 1,the stock market thus exhibits an immediate drop at t = 0, from 1 to q.10
Figure 9 shows that the stock market declined in 1973-74. No such sudden drop is
10

The drop is in this model due entirely to the jump in r. Hobijn and Jovanovic (2001) get a
bigger stock-market drop by assuming that the output produced by the old capital falls in price
when new capital is introduced — i.e., through the obsolescence of old capital.

visible for stock prices in the early 1890’s. Why not? Maybe because the market
was thin and unrepresentative in those days, with railway stocks absorbing a large
chunk of market capitalization. More likely, the realization that the new technology
would work well was more gradual and was not prompted by any single event like the
completion of the Niagara Falls dam in 1894.11
4.0.7

The productivity slowdown and multiple waves

The productivity slowdown (about 7 years) that the model seems to predict in the
last panels of Figures 3 and 4 is shorter than observed during the second transition,
at least. This may be related to the bigger puzzle for this paper, namely that each
technological transition as we have deÞned it had two merger waves, and not just
one, as the simulations imply.
11

We obtain the composite stock price index from Wilson and Jones (2002), and deßate using the
CPI.

4.0.8

Micro-estimates of φ and ψ

The two sets values for (µ, ν) of (2.7, 2.7) and (0.6, 0.06) used in the simulations are
higher than the micro data would suggest. In other words, the estimates that we
are about to report from the micro data suggest much higher costs of adjustment
(at least for acquisitions) than are needed to explain the aggregate data on exits and
mergers.
In another paper we use Q-theory to derive an investment equation for acquisitions
2
, (6) reads
from which one can uncover the adjustment-cost parameter. If φ (m) = m
2µ
m = µ (Q − q). Table 1 of Jovanovic and Rousseau (2002) reports an estimate of
µ = 0.022 from the Compustat data. The estimate was divided by 100 in order to
get it into the present units.
For the costs of exit we now look at evidence on the salvage value of capital from
Ramey and Shapiro (2001). Consider the resources lost when a z1 −Þrm retires some
of its capital. Let pi be the sales price divided by the purchase price of machine i.
Table 3 of Ramey and Shapiro reports the data. Per dollar spent on the machine, the
Þrm’s cost of retiring machine i is Ci ≡ 1 − pi . We imagine that if the Þrm were to
retire some of its capital, it would Þrst sell oﬀ those machines for which pi was closest
to unity, and so on in order
³ of´descending pi . Suppose the Þrm has k1 machines on
hand, i = 1, 2, ....k1 . Let G ki1 be the cumulative distribution of Ci among the stock
of machines:
µ ¶
i
.
Ci = G
k1
The total cost to the Þrm of retiring εk1 machines is

after the change of variables s0 = s/k1 , so that

Now suppose that the Ci are distributed uniformly on the interval [0, ν], so that
G (s) = ν1 s. Then ψ (ε) = ε2 /2ν. The age-aggregated data underlying Figure 3 of
Ramey and Shapiro’s paper were kindly supplied us by Valerie Ramey, and we plot
them in Figure 10. Indeed, there are more Ci values close to unity than to zero.
Ignoring this asymmetry, however, we would conclude that ν = 1.0, which actually
gives relatively low costs of adjustment, roughly half-way between the values of 0.06
and 2.7 used in the simulations.

Finally, we have assumed that φ and ψ are both convex in spite of evidence to
the contrary. The micro data on acquisitions suggest a Þxed-cost component to φ,
as we have argued in Jovanovic and Rousseau (2002). Similarly, exit is also likely to
involve Þxed costs — e.g., the auction in Ramey and Shapiro (2001) was costly to set
up. Such realism was sacriÞced in return for simpler algebra.

Related work

We mentioned David (1991) earlier. Boldrin and Levine (2001) also have a technology
for converting old capital to new. Since they do not allow goods to be converted
into new capital one for one, their results are diﬀerent. In related theoretical work,
Mortensen and Pissarides (1998) look at constant growth, not at transitions, and they
focus on the labor market, but their work is similar in that they have two modes of
job-improvement that are similar to the two that we have modeled. Caballero and
Hammour (1994) study transitions at business-cycle frequencies. Finally, Atkeson and
Kehoe (2001), Greenwood and Yorukoglu (1997) and Hornstein and Krusell (1996)
study transitions, but they do not focus on adjustment costs like we do.
20

The argument that mergers reallocate resources in much the same way as E&E
implies that they raise the values of the capital involved in mergers. Why, then, do
merger announcements lead to declines in the prices of acquirer shares? Jovanovic
and Braguinsky (2002) show that when Þrms have private information about the
quality of the capital that they own, the bidder discount is consistent with takeovers
being constrained eﬃcient.

6

Conclusion

This paper has studied the role of acquisitions and E&E in two economy-wide technological transformations. It reinforces the evidence in Jovanovic and Rousseau (2002)
for the view that mergers reallocate capital to more productive purposes and to more
eﬃcient managers. The adjustment costs associated with E&E seem to have risen
substantially relative to the adjustment costs associated with takeovers reßecting,
probably, the rising importance of organization capital.

Appendix: The planner’s solution

The economy is convex, competitive and there are no external eﬀects. We derive the
optimal solution for the planner here, whereas in the text we reinterpret the optimum
in terms of prices. We use optimal control. The Hamiltonian is

where e−ρt q ∗ is the multiplier on the kú 1 constraint, e−ρt Q∗ is the multiplier on the
kú 2 constraint, and e−ρt λ∗ is the multiplier on the non-negativity of k1 . To save on
notation, we have assumed that x1 = 0. This is valid if Q∗ > q∗ so that the planner
values k2 more than k1 . We also ignore the nonnegativity constraint on x2 . The
FOCs are

One caveat to the above is that it ignores the constraint x2 > 0. If the upgrading
technology is eﬃcient enough, the planner may prefer to set not just x1 (which we
have set equal to zero) but also x2 equal to zero for a while. We have ignored this
constraint, and the solution we derived would not be valid if ψ and especially φ were
low for relatively large values of ε or m.
