    "abstract": "\n\nAn economy benefits from advances in technical frontiers only when new technology comes into general use.  This paper measures the diffusion of computing equipment at a time when computing technology underwent dramatic technical improvement.  These data shed light on the long lag between advances in computing technology and advances in economic performance of users.  There is little evidence that long lags were produced by the 'slow diffusion' of new technology embodied in new hardware.  'Average practice' in computing advanced as rapidly as 'best practice,' lagging it by a maximum of 6 to 7 years.\n\n",
