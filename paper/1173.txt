Exchange Rate Dynamics with Sluggish Prices under Alternative Price—
Adjustment Rules

ABSTRACT

This paper studies exchange rate behavior in models with moving longrun equilibria incorporating alternative price—adjustment mechanisms.
The paper demonstrates that price—adjustment rules proposed by Mussa and
by Barro and Grossman yield models that are empirically indistinguishable

from each other. For speeds of goods—market adjustment that are "too
fast," the Barro—Grossman rule appears to induce instability; but we
argue

that when the rule

is interpreted properly, models incorporating

it are dynamically stable regardless of the speed at which disequilibrium

is eliminated. The Barro—Grossman pricing scheme is shown to be a
natural generalization, to a setting of moving long—run equilibria, of
less versatile schemes proposed in earlier literature on exchange rate
dynamics.

EXCHANGE RATE DYNAMICS WITH SLUGGISH PRICES UNDER ALTERNATIVE PRICE—
ADJUSTMENT RULES

Maurice Obstfeld and Kenneth Rogoff!'

1. INTRODUCTION
Recent research on the asset—market approach to exchange rates has
incorporated short—run Keynesian price rigidities into models assuming

rational expectations. These sticky-price models generally exhibit classical
properties in the long run, but allow for temporary goods—market disequilibrium
in response to real and monetary shocks that are less than perfectly anticipated.
A critical element in these models is the techanism determining how domestic

goods prices adjust over time in response both to current disequilibrium
and to expectations of future events.

In his seminal paper on exchange—rate determination with sticky
domestic prices, Dornbusch [19761 assumed that the nominal price of domestic
output is a predetermined variable that moves in response to current goods—
market disequilibrium only. Mussa [1977, 1982.] has criticized the simple
Dornbusch adjustment rule as being inadequate in situations where future
disturbances are anticipated or where the long—run equilibrium of the economy

moves over time. Frankel [1979], Liviatan [1980), and Buiter and Miller
[1981, 19821 introduce trend inflation into the Dornbusch model by linking
price adjustment to the underlying (constant) money growth rate in addition

to direct goods—market pressure. An alternative price—adjustment scheme
allowing for very general moving long—run equilibria is derived by Mussa [19811.
The paper compares the price—adjustment rule of Mussa [19811 to a

rule advanced by Barro and Grossman [19761 in a closed—economy context. The
interest of the Barro—Grossnian rule is twofold. First, like Mussa's rule,
that of Barro and Grossman is appropriate in models with anticipated future

disturbances or nonstationary long—run equilibria. Second, the Barro—Grossinan
rule contains the rules of Dornbusch, Frankel, Liviatan, and Buiter and
Miller as special cases, and thus has an intuitive interpretation.
The paper's central result is that the Mussa and Barro—Grossman
rules, though apparently quite dissimilar, yield structurally equivalent ex-

change rate models.' Thus, despite the key role of disequilibrium price
dynamics, the choice between the two adjustment mechanisms is not necessarily
a critical one.

2. THE LIMITING

FLEXIBLE—PRICE MODEL

The dynamics of a sticky—price exchange rate model with rational

expectations can be decomposed Into two components. The first

component

caused by the system's adjustment to current disequilibrium. The second

component is caused by movement of the equilibrium that would obtain if all
prices were fully flex.tble.-' Perfectly predictable trend movements in

2/ The models explored below assume that agents have perfect foresight, but
the structural equivalence result would carry over to an explicitly stochastic

environment such as the one assumed by Mussa [1982). In a stochastic setting,
structural equivalence is the same as econometric observational equivalence.
The "perfect foresight" assumption allows for the initial arrival of previously
unanticipated Information concerning the future paths of relevant exogenous var-

iables. After the initial moment, however, agents' expectations are fulfilled.

Even if prices are flexible and exogenous variables are stationary,
dynamics may arise from the adjust*ents of nonmonatary asset stocks to

long—run desired levels, as in Kouri (1976]. The class of models studied
in this paper abstracts from the dynamics of asset accumulation. For an
analysis of asset accumulation in a sticky—price model, see Henderson (1980].

the money supply or in the equilibrium terms of trade, for example, cause
no disequilibrium in a well—specified model, but do induce movements of the

system. In this section, we focus on the second source of dynamics by
solving a standard exchange rate model under the temporary assumption that
domestic prices are fully flexible, or, alternatively, that all movements
in the exogenous variables affecting the economy are perfectly anticipated.
The equilibrium path of this flexible—price model provides a limiting

benchmark for the sticky—price models analyzed later. This benchmark is
a natural generalization of the fixed tIloag_nU equilibrium appearing in
sticky—price models whose exogenous variables are static except for onetime unexpected jumps.

The exchange—rate model used here is of the extended small—country
variety, and is based on work of Dornbusch [1976] and Mussa [1977, l982].-"

output.

is

assumed to be fixed, and y and r* are assumed to be fixed and

equal to zero. The exegenous foreign—currency price of imports is likewise
assumed to be constant, with its natural loqarithm normalized to zero.

The model assumes rational expectations; this amounts to perfect

foresight in the absence of unanticipated shocks. Thus, there is no
distinction between actual and anticipated rates of change of e and p.
Equation (1) is the money—demand schedule, which relates the demand for
price—index deflated nominal balances to the home interest rate and income.

Equation (2) reflects the assumption that home—currency and foreign—
currency bonds are perfect substitutes. Equation (3) is the aggregate—
demand schedule, which posits that damand for domestic output depends on
the terms of trade, taates (as represented by u), the real rate of interest,

and income. Finally equations (4) and (5) require continuous clearing
of both the money and goods markets. Condition (5), which entails full
flexibility of domestic prices, will be relaxed in subsequent sections.

The flex—price equilibrium values of the exchange rate and domestic
output price are denoted by

Following

Sargent and Wallace [1973],

we close the model with the assumption that the economy must always lie on

its unique conditionally stable saddlepath1 As the appendix shows, the

Whether there is a stationary long—run equilibrium or a moving long—run
equilibrium, the saddlepath can be defined as the unique path of the
economy along which prices do not depend in part on pure speculative

"bubbles" unrelated to actual market conditions. The appendix discusses
the mathematical implementation of this definition in the present context.

Laplace transform technique is a convenient one for rational—expectations
models, although other solution techniques are available.

STICKY DOMESTIC PRICES AND ALTERNATIVE PRICE—ADJUSTMENT RULES

When

the

price of domestic output is sticky, the goods—market clearing

condition (5) need not hold. Following Dornbusch [1976], we assume that the
domestic output price is a predetermined or nonjumping variable that adjusts

gradually to eliminate goods-market disequilibrium. Dornbusch, who assumes that
the exogenous variables are constant except for one—time unanticipated jumps,
postulates the following price—adjustment scheme:
d

(8)

p=Tr(y —y).

While specification (8) is entirely appropriate given the environment
Dornbusch assumes, it may become inappropriate once anticipated shocks or

trend movements in exogenous variables are introduced.'
Gray and Turnovsky [19791 and Wilson [1979] use the Dornbusch model
with adjustment rule (8) to analyze a one—time anticipated increase in

the money supply. The solution these authors derive is qualitatively
sensible when the disturbance is expected to occur in the near future, but
problems arise when (8) is used to study money shocks that are anticipated

long before they occur. To see this, consider the economy's behavior as
the date of the future money increase recedes infinitely far into the

future. As the adjustment period preceding the intended policy act grows
longer, the disequilibrium caused by the announcement of that act should

disappear. In the limit of a perfectly anticipated money—stock increase ——

one that is anticipated "infinitely far" in advance —— the domestic output
price and the exchange rate should rise gradually and in proportion toward
the long—run equilibrium levels associated with the post—disturbance stock

!/ Mussa [1982] has emphasized these problems.

—7—

of money.' However, this equilibrium scenario is impossible with adjustment—
rule (8), because the price level cannot rise in the absence of excess

demand. Even perfectly anticipated money shocks must cause goods—market
disequilibrium.•

Similar difficulties surround the Frankel [19791, Liviatan [1980],

and Buiter—Miller [1981, 1982) extensions of Dornbusch's price—adjustment

9 Prices naturally exhibit this behavior in the flex—price model of the
previous section. When the money shock is expected to occur in finite
time and prices are flexible, the domestic output price and exchange rate,
after an initial equiproportionate jump when the announcement is made, rise
smoothly and in proportion so that the economy is at its long—run equilibrium

when the money supply increases. This type of adjustment to imperfectly
anticipated shocks is impossible in the sticky—price setting, but it is
still true that, after the initial announcement, price evolve smoothly.
In particular, the exchange rate cannot jump when the expected money
increase takes place, for an anticipated discrete jump would entail an
unexploited opportunity to earn an infinite instantaneous rate of return
on foreign bonds.

10/ To be precise, the problems with the Gray—Turnovsky and Wilson analyses

are not caused exclusively by the price—adjustment scheme these authors adopt.
An additional source of nonneutrality is their assumption that aggregate
demand is a function of the nominal, rather than the real, domestic interest

rate. It is easy to see that in a well—specified model, the nominal
interest rate would rise over time during the adjustment to a perfectly
anticipated money increase while the real interest rate would remain constant.

to

environments of secular inflation." These authors modify (8)

by adding to the excess demand term the current rate of nominal money

growth. The resulting adjustment rule is

(9

p=r(y —y)+m.

Specification (9) is consistent with an assumption that all changes in the

monetary growth rate are unanticipated. But the rule implies unreasonable
asymptotic behavior when anticipated changes are analyzed. Consider, for
example, a perfectly anticipated increase in the monetary growth rate. With
higher trend nney growth, long—run in — p is lower. Thus, a perfectly
anticipated money—growth increase should cause m — p to decline over time

but should not occasion disequilibrium. Becanse p is predetermined, however,
rule (9) implies that in — p can fall over time only if the announcement of
the future increase in th

creates

an excess demand for output that does

not vanish as the date of the increase becomes infinitely distant.
While the price—adjustment rules described. so far are unsatisfactory

in many situations, a generalization which contains these rules as special

cases is adequate for the analysis of any type of disturbance. Assume

now that

is a function not only of current disequilibrinm, but also of

the rate at which the price of domestic output would increase if that price were

Like

Dornbusch [1976], section V, Buiter and Miller analyze a nx,del

in which output is demand—determined and therefore endogenous. In that
model, the disequilibrium term entering their price adjustment rule

potential output. Our analysis applies with only minor modifications to
variable—output models; see footnote 15 below.

section. This type of pricing rule is suggested by Barro and Grossman [1976]
in a closed—economy setting, although they do not assume rational expectations

regarding

It is easy to see that the Barro—Grossman rule reduces to

Dornbusch's rule (8) when the exogenous variables are fixed except for
unanticipated jumps, for in that case,

0.

Similarly, the rule reduces

to (9) when the only expected change in the exogenous variables is the

growth of money at a constant rate. However, the rule does not rednce to
Dornbusch's rule (8) in the case of the one—time expected money increase

analyzed by Gray and Turnovsky [1979] and by Wilson 11979]. If it is
announced at time t = 0 that the money stock will increase by an amount

m at time t = T, then

T)/X]

That the Barro—Grossman rule is immune to the criticisms levelled

at rules (8) and (9) is clear. Perfectly anticipated shocks —— whether
real or nominal —— do not cause disequilibrium when price adjustment is
given by (10).

Since the equilibrium flexible—price

does not jump

discontinuously at any point in response to a change announced "infinitely
far" In advance, p will fully trace its movements under (10).

Mussa [1977, l982J suggests an alternative rule, and demonstrates
that it, too, renders disequilibrium price adjustment unnecessary when

shacks are perfectly anticipated. The Mussa rule is given by

Alternative microeconomic rationales f or the Mussa price—adjustment

rule are presented in McCallum [1980], Mussa (19811, and Flood [1982b].
Mussa's derivation, for example, assumes monopolistic firms for whom price

changes are costly. Flood's inventory—adjustment story assumes that firms

set their prices a period in advance of market transactions.—

The Barro—Grossman rule (10) and the Mussa rule (11) appear quite
unrelated, and It is natural to ask how these different price—adjustment

schemes affect the dynamic behavior of the economy. We address this question
in the next section by comparing explicit solutions of models incorporating
the two rules.

13/ Flood's justification of the Mussa rule is based on work of Green
and Laf font [1981]. Rotemberg [19811 points out some limitations of
Mussa's [1981] rationale.

The following result clarifies the relationship between the Barro—
Grossman and Mussa pricing rules:

the Barro—Grossman price adjustment scheme (10) and the Mussa

when (13) holds, the rational—expectations equilibrium of the model described

when e is so chosen, —0q = r2 [cf. (15)]. The two models are therefore

structurally equivalent.

It is important to note that the theorem holds only along the

saddlepath. The models are not

structurally equivalent elsewhere.

When condition (13) is violated (as it necessarily is for r sufficiently
large), the model with the Barro—Grossman adjustment rule has two characteristic roots

with positive real part. Sadalepath stability requires that a negative root
be associated with each predetermined variable in the model; and because p
is predetermined, a rational—expectations equilibrium will not exist in

general when (13) fails and the model is •unstable.-' In contrast, the
Mussa rule necessarily yields saddlepath stability for any nonnegative
values of the system's parameters; and as the speed—of-adjustment parameter

0 + -fco, the Mussa model converges smoothly to the flex-price model. It
seems worri&ome, at first glance, that under the Barro—Grossman rule, the
economy becomes unstable and does not converge to the flex—price model as
ii

÷ +cx.

We will argue shortly that when the price adjustment Implied by

the Barro—Grosstnan mechanism is interpreted properly, (13) always holds
and this apparent convergence problem disappears.

14, The instability is due to the fact that when (13) does not hold, a
positive shock to aggregate demand (an increase in u) leads, ceteris
paribus, to falling prices.

—13—

The following result makes apparent the essential reason for the
two models' structural equivalence:

COROLLARY. Along the saddlepath of the Mussa model, the output price p
obeys a differential equation having the same form as the Barro—Grossnian

equation (10). More precisely, along the saddlepath of the Mussa model,

The foregoing corollary shows why the Mussa model is necessarily

saddlepath stable. Although prices in

that

model do adjust according

to a Barro—Grossman—type rule, the model can never be unstable because,
by (19), the stability criterion

(25) l—&a>O
is always satisfied [cf. equation (13)]. By assuming the Mussa rule, we
effectively limit the parameter ó to values between 0 (0

0) and l/c&a (0 m -f0).

Even though the Nussa rule places an upper bound on the excess—demand coefficient
6 appearing in (18), there is no upper bound on the speed at which goods—

market disequilibrium is eliminated. As was pointed out above, the Mussa
model converges to the equilibrium flex—price model as 0 --

-f and S

1/acT.

A consequence of these findings is that the speed of goods—market
adjustment under the Barro—Grossman rule (10) becomes infinite as ii -- 1/acT.

Accordingly, that rule yields a saddlepoint—stable model for

speed of

goods—market adjustment. Contrary to appearances, the stability condition

l5

(13) does not limit one to adjustment speeds which are not too great.—

15/ The isomorphism results presented here are readily extended to
variable—output versions of the exchange rate model, like that of Büiter
and Miller [1981, 1982 1 and those compared by Flood [1982a 1. The stability

condition when the Barro—Grossman mechanism is used is slightly more complicated
in the variable-output case if money demand depends on actual output.

The stability criterion, in that case, is X(1 —

y)

0.

Otherwise, the isomorphism between variable—output models incorporating
the Barro—Grossman rule and those incorporating the Mussa rule can be
proved as in the text.

5. CONCLUSION
This paper has studied the consequences of adopting alternative
sticky—price adjustment rules in exchange rate models characterized by

moving long—run equilibria. A price—adjustment scheme suggested by Barro
and Grossman 119761 in a different context was shown to be a natural generalization of less versatile price—adjustment schemes advanced by Dornbusch [1976],
by Frankel [19791, by Liviatan [1980], and by Buiter and Miller [198l,j 1982].

It was also demonstrated that use of the Barro—Grossman rule results in an

exchange rate model that is structurally equivalent to one based on the
apparently quite different price—adjustment rule proposed by Mussa [1977,

1982]. The choice between the Barro—Grossman and Mussa rules is therefore
16 /
not critical for many theoretical and empirical applications.—
Unlike the

simpler price—adjustment rules used in earlier studies, either yields
sensible results for

expected path of the exogenous variables driving

the system.

16/ As Lucas [1976] argues, changes of policy regime could alter the
parameters appearing in the two rules. In some cases it mar be easier
to model this possibility using the Mussa rule, which at present has a
somewhat better—developed microeconomic rationale.

This

appendix calculates explicit solution paths for the flexible—price

exchange rate model and the two sticky—price models discussed in the text.
These rational—expectations models are solved by the method of Laplace

transforms, which is equivalent to the operator solution procedure described

by Sargent [l979J..i The Laplace transform of a function

(Al)

L(f t ) =

is defined by

I0 exp(—9t)f dt,

and is a function of 2.21 The key theorem invoked belo!1 is that a
continuous function is uniquely determined on (0, co) by its Laplace transform

(see Sokolnikoff and Redheffer 11966]). It is easy to verify that: (1)

Equation (A8) expresses the path of the exchange rate as a function of its
own initial value (e0) and the initial value of the price of domestic output

(p0). These two initial conditions are uniquely determined by the saddlepath
assumption, which requires that the coefficients of the explosive "bubble"
terms, exp(t/X) and exp(u)t), be zero (see Sargent and Wallace [1973]). The

requirement that the economy be on its saddlepath implies [by (A8)] that

According to (All) and (A12), the flex—price exchange rate and
domestic output price depend both on future expected monetary disturbances

(represented by n) and future expected real disturbances (represented by

u). However the flex—price real exchange rate ,

is

defined

as

The real exchange rate thus depends exclusively on current and anticipated

future real shocks; it is not influenced by monetary factors. Expression
(A13) reflects the real—monetary dichotomy that characterizes the flex—price
exchange—rate model.

2. Sticky Prices and the Barro—Grossman Adjustment Rule
To introduce sticky prices and the Barro—Grossman adjustment scheme,
assume that the domestic ouput price is a predetermined variable and replace
the goods—market equilibrium condition (A3) with the equation

(A14)

where

in the previous section. Equilibrium e and Pt in the present model
satisfy (A2) and (A14), while

satisfy (A2) and (A3). It follows

that under the Barro—Grossman price dynamics, the exchange rate and output

According to (A18) and (A19), e and Pt converge to their flex—price
values

and

at a rate given by Iri2I. At any point, the deviation

of actual e or Pt from Its flex—price value is proportional to the initial
discrepancy between the predetermined initial output price p0 and its

flex—price level p0 given by (AlO). If there is no disequilibrium initially,

-A6-

a divergence between p0 and p0 can arise only as the result of previously
unanticipated information arriving at time t = 0.
