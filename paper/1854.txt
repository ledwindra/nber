The Dollar as a Speculative Bubble:
A Tale of Fundarrentalists and Cthartists

ABSTRACT

Several recent developments have inspired us to consider a
non-standard model of the dollar as a speculative bubble without
the constraint of fully rational expectations: (1) the dollar continued to rise in 1984 after real interest rate differentials and other
fundamentals began moving the wrong way; (2) the results of
market efficiency tests imply, that the rationally expected rate of
dollar depreciation has been less than the forward discount; (3)
Krugman-Marris current account calculations suggest that the
rationally expected rate of depreciation is greater than the forward discount; (4) survey data show an expected rate of depreciation that is also greater than the forward discount; (5) the
hypothesis of a "safe-haven" shift into U.S. assets and a decrease
in the U.S. risk premium, which would explain some of the forego-

ing, is contradicted by a decline in the differential between

offshore interest rates (covered) and U.S. interest rates.
Our model features three classes of actors: fundamentalists,
chartists and portfolio managers. Fundamentalists forecast a
depreciation of the dollar based on an overshooting model that
would be rational if there were no chartists. Chartists extrapolate
recent trends based on an information set that includes no funda-

mentals. Portfolio managers take positions in the market, and
thus determine the exchange rate, based on expectations that are

a weighted average of the fundamentalists and chartists. The first

stage of the dollar appreciation after 1980 is explained by
increases in real interest differentials. The second stage is

explained by the endogenous takeoff of a speculative bubble when
the fundamentalists have mis-forecast for so long that they have
lost credibility. In 1985, the dollar may have entered a third stage
in which an ever-worsening current account deficit begins a reversal of the bubble.

1. Introduction

When the dollar began to appreciate in 1980, there was no shortage of
economists who thought they could explain it on the basis of economic funda-

mentals. But as the appreciation continued, it became harder to explain. Especially after mid-1984, with fundamental variables moving in the wrong direction

(money growth rates, short-term interest rates, long-term real interest rates,
trade deficits and apparent risk factors), more economists began to consider
seriously the possibility that the dollar was on a speculative bubble path.

As early as 1982, Dornbusch had applied the notion of stochastic rational

bubbles to the case of the strong dollar. According to this theory, there is a

probability at any point in time that the bubble will burst during the
Much of this research was conducted in the Fail of 1985, while the authors were visiting at
the International Monetary Fund and the Federal Reserve Board, respectively, We would
like to thank Kathryn Doimnguez of Yale University and Laura Ethoy of the Institute for
International Economics for generously providing survey data on exchange rate expectations (from Money Market Services, Inc., and the Economist Pnpnr'pi Rpnnrt respectively)
and John CaiverL y and Barbara Bruer of American Express for providing similar data. We
would also like to thank the National Science Foundation under grant No. SES 8218300 and

-2subsequent period and the value of the currency will return to the equilibrium

level determined by fundamentals. The differential in interest rates fully
reflects and compensates for the possibility of the bubble bursting.

More recently it has been suggested that the dollar may in fact be on an

irrational bubble path. Two influential papers, Marris (1985) and Krugman
(1985), argue that the mounting U.S. indebtedness to foreigners represented by

record current account deficits will eventually force the dollar down sharply,
and that this prospective depreciation is not correctly reflected in the small
forward discount or interest differential (either short-term or long-term). "It

appears that the market has simply not done its arithmetic, and has failed to
realize that its expectations about continued dollar strength are not feasible"
(Krugman (1985), p. 40))
Meanwhile,

evidence has continued to accumulate that the forward

discount is a biased predictor of the future spot rate. A favorite way of explain-

ing away such apparent statistical rejections of rational expectations is to
appeal to the sort of "peso problem" that might arise in a speculative bubble.

But one of the present authors has presented calculations that tend to undermine the hypothesis that the dollar could have been on a single rational bubble
from 1981 to 1985.2 The expected probability of collapse that investors have

built in to the observed interest differential was high enough that it is very
unlikely the dollar would have made it through four years without the bubble
bursting, if that expectation was rational. This leaves the possibility of an irra-

tional bubble where the true probability of collapse may be different from the
expected probability that investors build in to the forward discount.

lUing (1965) also argues that the value of the dollar rests on market expectations that
do not embody a return to steady state. Ten years earlier, Mckinnon (1976) attributed exchange rate volatility to a "deficiency of stabilizing speculation" that is, an unwillingness of
investors to take open positions based on fundamentals equilibrium, rather than to
capital mobility with rational expectations" as the orthodoxy has it.

Franlcel (1965a,b).

-3In this paper we propose the outlines of a model of a speculative bubble
that is not constrained by the assumption of rational expectations. The model

features three classes of actors: fundamentalists, chartists and portfolio
managers. None of the three acts utterly irrationally, in the sense that each
performs the specific task assigned him in a reasonable, realistic way. Funda-

mentalists think of the exchange rate according to a model --

say,

the Born-

busch overshooting model for the sake of concreteness--that would be exactly

correct if there were no chartists in the world. Chartists do not have fundamentals such as the long-run equilibrium rate in their information set; instead

they use autoregressive models--say, simple extrapolation for the sake of
concreteness--that have only the time series of the exchange rate itself in the
information set. Finally portfolio managers, the actors who actually buy and
sell foreign assets, form their expectations as a weighted average of the predic-

tions of the fundamentalists and chartists. The portfolio managers update the
weights over time in a rational Bayesian manner, according to whether thc fun-

damentalists or the chartists have recently been doing a better job of forecast-

ing. Thus each of the three is acting rationally subject to certain constraints.
Yet the model departs from the reigning orthodoxy in that the agents could do

better, in expected value terms, if they knew the complete model. When the

bubble takes off, agents are irrational in the sense that they learn about the

model more slowly than they change it. Furthermore, the model may be
unstable in the neighborhood of the fundamentals equilibrium, but stable
around a value for the dollar that is far from that equihbriurn.

This departure from orthodoxy is radical enough to call for some further
motivation. As Franco Modigliani says, one does not want to abandon rational

expectations except as a last resort. Section 2 discusses the apparent failure
of models based on fundamentals, the apparent failure of the rational expecta-

-4tions hypothesis, and the apparent failure of the models of a rational speculative bubble, to accord fully with simple empirical facts of the 1981-85 period.
Section 3 elaborates on the distinction between chartists and fundamentalists,
and offers some evidence from expectations survey data that respondents seem

to form very short-term expectations more like chartists and more long-term
expectations like fundamentalists. Section 4 describes the model in more detail
and shows how it can work to explain the 1980-85 path of the dollar.
2. What Is Wrong With Models Based on Fundamentals and Rational Bubbles?

This is not the place to survey existing models of exchange rate determina-

tion.3 Nor are we going to argue that the empirical evidence shows the fundamentals models to be worthless. We actually believe with many others that the

appreciation of the dollar, at least in its earlier stages, was explained relatively

well by increases in real interest differentials, in turn attributable to shifts in
the U.S. monetary/fiscal mix, as in the standard models that predate the 1980s
experience. (We consider below the more novel fundamentals hypothesis that

the increase in the real interest differential and in the real value of the dollar

were attributable to improved tax treatment of business and to "safe haven"

motives.) Under a wide variety of measures of expected inflation, the real
interest differential, both long-term and short-term, rose sharply after 1980.
But by most measures the short-term real differential peaked in mid-1982, and
by virtually all measures it declined after mid-1984, either short-term or longterm. Thus, as Dornbusch (1983) pointed out, the puzzle for models based on

fundamentals is not why the dollar rose initially, but why it stayed so high so
long:
Modeis of exchange rate determination developed in the 1970s are surveyed in Frankel
(1983). In an anfluen:a1 parer, Meese and Rogoff (1983) show that these models perform

very poorly out of sample. More recent developments, including the real interest
differential calculations cited in the text, are covered in Frankel (1955b).

-5"The [overshooting] model for the real interest rate does well in
explaining that a rise in U.S. interest rates should lead to an appreciation of the real exchange rate. But it fails when it predicts that the
real exchange rate should also be depreciating. That has not in fact
been happening, and a theory is needed that will explain why the dollar - real or nominal - is both high jd stuck."

The dollar began its long-awaited depreciation in March 1985. If that trend

continues, then the period during which real interest rates and the dollar were
clearly moving in opposite directions will have been confined to nine months or

so not sufficient grounds in itself for jettisoning the existing models. Neverthe-

less, the appreciation up through February 1985 was spectacular enough, and

the value of the dollar remained high enough thereafter, to lead a number of

economists to suggest the bubble hypothesis. Thus it is worthwhile to see
whether the hypothesis can be formalized in a manner consistent with the
empirical facts.

2.1. Tests of Rational Expectations, and the Risk Premium in the Forward
Market

Both Krugman and Marris have mentioned as partial support for their

claim that the foreign exchange market may not be rational the large
econometric literature that statistically rejects the hypothesis that the forward
discount (or equivalently, by covered interest parity, the interest dillerential) is

an unbiased predictor of the future spot rate. The most common test in this

literature is a regression of the ex post change in the spot exchange rate
against the forward discount at the beginning of the period. Under the null
hypothesis the coefficient should be unity. But most authors have rejected the

null hypothesis, finding that the coefficient is much closer to zero, and some
even finding that the coefficient is of the incorrect sign. Even if one does not

wish to go along with the extreme form of the conclusion, that the forward
market points in the wrong direction, the implication is nonetheless that one

-6could expect to make money by betting against the forward discount whenever
it is non-zero.4
This forward market finding poses a puzzle in the context of the Krugman-

Marris characterization of the dollar. It implies that as of 1985 (or for that

matter at any time over the last five years) the rationally expected rate of
future dollar depreciation is less than the 3 percent a year implied in the forward discount.5 The Krugman-Marris argument is that the rationally expected

rate of future dollar depreciation would be much greater than the 3 percent a
year implicit (against the mark) in the market.6 If we are to allow expectations

to fail to be rational, we must somehow reconcile the two conflicting kinds of
failure.

More discussion of the alleged bias in the forward exchange market is
required. Most of the literature (for example the papers cited in footnote 4)

does not interpret the finding as necessarily rejecting the hypothesis of
rational expectations. Two other possible explanations are routinely offered:
the existence of a risk premium, and the "peso problem." We believe that, while

both factors can be very important in other contexts, neither explains the systematic prediction errors made by the forward market during the strong-dollar
" Studies regressing against the forward discount include Tryon (1979),
Levich (1980),

Bilson (1981), Longworth (1981), Longworth, Boothe and Clinton (1983), F'ama (1984) and
Fluang (1984). Cumby and Obstfeld (1984) regressad against the interest differential and
again found that for most exchange rates the coefficient was significantly less than 1.0 and

even less than zero. These findings are also consistent with those of Macsc and Rogoff
(1983) that the random walk predicts not only better than other models, but better than

the forward discount as well.
During the period Tune 1981 to March 1985 the 3- and 6-month forward markets have
been significantly biased (underpredicting the value of the dollar) even unconditicnauy.In
other words, one could have made money by following the rule to be always long in doLars
regardless what the forward discount was (Prankel and Proot (1985, 18-20)). Expectations

survey data show the same unconditional bias. Their availability dictated the choice of

sample period.

Krugman and Marris did not say that there is any reason to think that the dollar
plunge would necessarily come in the next year; the focus is on the market's expected
long-term rate of depreciation implicit in the long-term interest differential. We have no
tests of unbiasedness going out a year or more. The problem is not the absence of a forward market going out more than a year; we can always use the long-term interest
differential. The problem is rather that twelve years of floating-rate data would not offer
enough independent observations.

-7period. We consider the risk premium in the next two subsections, and the peso
problem in the third one.

The first possible explanation is that the systematic component of the
apparent prediction errors is really a risk premium separating the forward rate

from investors' true expectations. It is a difficult argument either to refute or
confirm, because expectations are not directly observable. More information is

needed. The most appealing source of additional information is the theory of
optimal portfolio diversification, which says that the risk premium, if that is
what the systematic prediction errors are, should be related to such factors as

the degree of investor risk aversion, the "outside" supplies of nominal assets
denominated in various currencies, the variance-covariance matrix of exchange
rates, and covariances with returns on other assets and opportunities. It seems

plausible that a positive risk premium on dollars of this type explains some
positive fraction of the 1955 forward discount (or interest differential) given the

great increase in recent years in the supply of dollar assets as a share of the
world portfolio, relative to the likely determinants of demand (i.e., given the
record federal budget and current account deficits without likely corresponding movements in residents' minimum-variance portfolios). Unfortunately, the
theory of optimal portfolio diversification, together with the standard estimates

of the coefficient of relative risk-aversion being in the neighborhood of 2.O,
implies that the magnitude of the risk premium is on the order of only a few
basis points. Unless the true coefficient of risk-aversion is much higher than is

conventionally thought, the risk premium cannot explain more than a small
fraction of the bias in the forward discount.8
? Friend and Biume (1975)
estimate the coefficient of relative risk-aversion to be in the
neighborhood of two in the context of investors' portfolio behavior, Stern (1977) provides a
survey of estimates in other contexts, most also in the neighborhood of two.

If the supply of dollar assets happens to correspond to the share in the minimum-

variance portfolio, then the risk premium is zero, As of 1984 the ratio of outstanding US.

-8The conclusion that international substitutability is very high, and thus
that the risk premium is very small, depends entirely on the optimal portfolio
argument. The hypothesis that investors diversify their portfolios optimally has
not itself held up well to statistical tests.9

If one is prepared to abandon the portfolio optimization hypothesis, there
are few alternative sources of information to help isolate the risk premium out
of the prediction errors made by the forward discount. One promising possibil-

ity is the surveys of market participants' exchange rate expectations conducted by the Economist's Financial Report and the American Express Bank
Review.10 In Frankel and Froot (1985) we showed that those data for the 1981-

85 period reflect a considerably greater expectation of dollar depreciation than
do the forward discount or interest differential. (Some of the relevant statistics

are reported in Table 3 below.) We repeated standard tests of unbiasedness in
expected depreciation and found even more significant rejections when the sur-

vey data, which must be free from any risk premium, are used than when the
forward discount is used. One would have persistently made money in the l9BOs

either by following the rule "buy and hold dollars" (unconditional bias) or by
following the rule "always bet against the forward discount" (the same condi-

tional bias found in the earlier studies cited in footnote 4). A second paper,
Froot (1985, 21-23), shows that the rejection of rational expectations holds up

even if one allows for measurement error in the survey data (provided it is
up by .10 through some combination of deficits and dollar appreciation, the implication is
that the risk premium paid on dollar assets has gone up by only about 0.20 percent per annum or 20 basis points. Thus the risk premium accounts for very little of a 300 basis point
interest differential.
Frankel (1985a, 211-217) presents these numbers, develops the a

priori argument that the risk premium must be small, and gives other references. The

essence of the argument is originally due to Krugman (1981).
Frankel and Engel (1984) reject the international optimization hypothesis in a meanvariance framework. Hodrick and Srivastava (1984) do so in a more general intertemporal
framework.
The Economist survey covers 13 leading international banks and has been conducted
six times a year since 1981. The American Express survey covers 250 to 300 central bank-

ers, private bankers, corporate treasurers and economists, and has been conducted more

irregularly since 1976.

-9random): one can reject the hypothesis that expectations are rational and that
the apparent bias in the survey numbers is entirely due to measurement error.
In addition, Eroot tests the hypothesis that

information about the risk prem-

ium is revealed in regressions of the ex post change in the spot rate on the for-

ward discount. This hypothesis cannot be rejected, suggesting that the risk
premium does not help explain why changes in the forward discount mispredict

future changes in the spot rate.
2.2. A Test of the Safe-Haven Hypothesis

If the survey numbers are taken seriously as measuring investors' rate of
expected depreciation, they imply a large negative risk premium paid on dollar

assets during the 1981-85 period (a sharp decline from the near-zero risk
premium in the 1970s). This is very different from either the positive risk prem-

ium implied by standard tests of bias in the forward discount or the near-zero

risk premium implied by portfolio optimization. Is a negative risk premium
plausible nevertheless? Standard portfolio considerations would suggest not.
The exchange risk premium in theory should depend on such variables as asset

supplies and on return variances and covariances. The large U.S. government

budget deficit and current account deficits mean that asset supplies should
currently be driving the dollar risk premium
not down. One could posit an
increase in the perceived riskiness of European currencies relative to the dol-

lar, attributable to for example to an increase in uncertainty regarding European monetary policy relative to U.S. monetary policy. But in that case it would
be difficult to explain the increase in the U.S. interest differential after 1980; by

itself a shift in demand toward U.S. assets due to uncertainty should have
driven U.S. interest rates down.11
Simtlary an increase in U.S. monetary uncertainty could exran hLgher U.S. interest
rates, but not the appreciation of the dollar. On these points, see Branson (1985) and
The Council of Economic Advisers (1984, p. 54-55)

- 10 There

is one explanation that has been seriously proposed for the dollar

appreciation that is consistent with both a fall in the risk premium on dollars
and an increase in the interest differential, in other words, consistent with the

expected rate of depreciation increasing even more than the interest
differential. That is the so-called "safe haven" explanation: an exogenous shift
in demand toward U.S. assets due to perceptions of reduced country risk in the

United States relative to abroad. According to this theory, risk has declined in

the United States because of an improved business climate, in particular
improved tax treatment for investment after 1981, which also explains the
increase in U.S. real interest rates via an alleged investment boom.12 Risk has

increased in the rest of the world, not just because of debt problems in Latin
America (which would alone not be relevant for the exchange rate or return
differentials between the United States and Europe) but also because of political or country risk in Europe. Dooley and Isard (1935), for example, speak of a

perceived threat of penalties on capital in Europe, "where the term 'penalty' is

loosely defined to include formal taxation, the postponement of interest and
principal payments, confiscation, destruction of property, and so forth."

We here propose a simple test be used to evaluate the safe haven
hypothesis: a comparison of interest rates paid on securities that are physically located offshore, but that are denominated in dollars or otherwise covered

on the forward exchange market to get around the problem of exchange risk,
with interest rates paid on securities in the United States. That is, we are test-

ing international closed, or covered, interest parity, not uncovered interest
One widely cited piece of evidence against the safe haven hypothesis is that the increase in U.S. real interest rates was accompanied by a lower investment rate averaged over
the 1981-85 period, not a higher one. (See, for example, Friedman (1985) or Frankel

(1985a).) However others dispute this calculation; see Bianchard and Summers (1984).

Another piece of evidence against the safe haven hypothesis is that the correlation between

U.S. stock market price changes and those abroad (Germany or Japan) has been positive;
Obstfeld (1985) argues that i! portfolio demands had exogenously shifted from foreign assets to U.S. assets, the U.S. stock market boom should have been accompanied by a stock
market decline abroad.

- 11-

parity. Tests of the offshore-onshore differential have been frequently
employed to illustrate a number of points about the existence of capital con-

trols or country risk: a negative differential for Germany until 1974 showed
that capital controls discouraged capital inflow (Dooley and Isard (1930));

a

positive differential for the United Kingdom until 1979 showed that capital con-

trols discouraged outflow; positive differentials for France and Italy show that
controls still discourage outflow (e.g., Giavazzi and Pagano (1985), Claassen and

Wyplosz (1982)); a negative differential for Japan until 1979 showed that con-

trols discouraged inflow (Otani and Tiwari (1981); Ito (1984) and Frankel
(1984)); and, but for the foregoing exceptions, the generally small magnitude of

differentials shows that capital mobility is very high among the major industrialized countries (e.g., Frenkel and Levich (1975), McCormick (1979), Boothe et
al. (19B5)).13

Table 1 reports mean daily differentials between offshore interest rates
(covered) and domestic U.S. interest rates, for seven different pairs of securi-

ties. Remarkably, there was a relatively substantial positive differential in
almost all cases, until recently, regardless whether one observes the offshore
interest rate in the Euromarket, in the domestic U.K. market, or in the domestic
German market.14 From 1979 to 1982, the Euromarket rates exceeded the U.S.

interbank rate by an average of about 100 basis points. A number of studies
have noted that the Eurodollar rate does not move perfectly with the U.S. inter-

bank or CD rate (Hartman (1983), Kreicher (1982)). They attribute the
differential primarily to the fact that U.S. banks face reserve requirements
13

Small' might be defined as less than 50 basis points, to allow for differences in default risk and tax treatment attaching to the particular security, as well as inevitable minor
differences in timing.
14 In 1978 the differential between the domestic U.K. and domestic U.S. interestrate is
negative (columns 4 or 5 in Table 1). This is because of the above-mentioned U.K-capital
controls that were removed in 1979, as is evident from the differential between the Europound interest rate and domestic U.K. rates (column 2 or 3 in Table 2).

against domestic deposits but not against Eurodeposits, so they are willing to

pay a higher interest rate to depositors offshore. But the differential has been
mostly swept under the rug in more general studies of covered interest parity.

Even those who have studied the Eurodollar-U.S. interbank differential
treat it as a peculiarity of that particular market. This would make sense only

if, on the one hand, the U.S. interbank rate were depressed below other
U.S.interest rates (by U.S. reserve requirements) or if, on the other hand, Euro-

currency interest rates were raised above domestic European interest rates
(either by analogous reserve requirements in European countries or by perceived default risk in the Euromarket). But neither of these effects seems to
hold. Table 2 shows small spreads between the Eurodollar rate and the Euro-

pound or Euromark rates (covered) or between them and the domestic U.K.
and German interest rates.
Indeed, Table 1 shows that the spread between
covered pound or mark interest rates and domestic U.S. rates is even higher,
and comes down even more after 1982, when Treasury bill rates are used as
when banking rates are used. This finding contradicts the hypothesis that U.S.

reserve requirements are the only factor driving a wedge between the
Euromarket and the U.S. interbank market and that more direct arbitrage
through other means works to reduce that wedge.
Why were foreigners and U.S. residents buying U.S. Treasury bills in 19791982 when they paid about 2 percent less than U.K. Treasury bills? The obvious response is that U.S. securities were preferred for safe-haven reasons. But

since the differential predates the appreciation of the dollar, there is some
difficulty in associating the two. This is particularly true after 1982, when the

differential declines sharply. By 1985. when the dollar had appreciated much
further, the Eurodollar rate was only 30 basis points above the domestic U.S.

interbank interest rate, in the same range as the differentials for the pound,

mark, yen, Canadian dollar, and Swiss franc. Chart 1 shows a comparison of the

London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) with a domestic U.S. CD rate, adjusted for

reserve requirements. The differential, which was clearly positive in the early
l9BOs, peaked during the Mexican debt crisis in August 1982, and has declined

steadily ever since, currently to about zero. The evidence thus suggests that

the United States was perceived as increasingly risky after 1982. The story
based on safe-haven fundamentals does not explain the continued appreciation

of the dollar from 1982 to February 1985 any better than the story based on

real interest fundamentals. The field would appear to be open to bubble
theories.
2.3. Rational Speculative Bubbles and the "Peso Problem"

The possibility of speculative bubbles leads to the second explanation,
besides the risk premium, that is often given for the econometric findings of
biasedness in the forward exchange market: the peso problem. The standard
tests presume that the error term, the difference between expected depreciation and the ex post realization, is distributed normally and independently over

time. But if there is a small probability of a big decline in the value of the
currency, the distributional assumption will not be met, the estimated standard

errors wilt be incorrect, and an apparent rejection of unbiasedness may be
spurious.15 This problem is thought to be relevant for pegged currencies like
the Mexican peso up until 1976, and normally less relevant for floating curren-

cies. But if the dollar has been on a single speculative bubble path for four
years, there could well be a small probability of a large decline in the form of a

bursting of the bubble. It has been suggested that the forward discount may

properly reflect that possibility, and that tests find a bias only because the
15 Evans (1985) avoids this problem by employing a nonparametric sign test of toe forward rate prediction errors.

event happens not to have occurred in the sample.

Calculations in Frankel (1985a, b) tend to undermine the hypothesis that
the forward discount during the period 1981-85 has reflected rational expecta-

tions of a small probability of a large decline in the value of the dollar. Under

the hypothesis that the bursting of the bubble would reverse half of the real

appreciation of the dollar against the mark that has taken place since the
1970s, a 3 percent forward discount in March 1985 implied a 2.8 percent per-

ceived probability of collapse during that month. One can multiply out the
implied probabilities of non-collapse since January 1981, with no distributional

assumptions needed, to find that the chance that such a bubble would have
persisted for four years without bursting is only 3 percent. Thus the peso prob-

lem does not "get the forward exchange market off the hook." The period during which the forward discount was positive with no realized depreciation simply

went on too long for the rational expectations hypothesis to emerge intact.
3. Fundamentalists and Chartists

We can gather the conclusions reached so far into five propositions, each
with elements of paradox.

(i) The dollar continued to rise even after all fundamentals (the interest
differential, current account, etc.) apparently began moving the wrong way.
The only explanation left would seem to be, almost tautologically, that investors

were responding to a rising expected rate of change in the value of the dollar.
In other words, the dollar was on a bubble path.

(2) Evidence suggests that the investor-expected rate of depreciation
reflected in the forward discount is not equal to the rationally-expected rate of

depreciation. The failure of a fall in the dollar to materialize in four years
implies that the rationally-expected rate of depreciation has been less than the

forward discount.

(3) On the other hand, Krugman-Marris current account calculations sug-

gest that the rationally-expected rate of depreciation is greater than the
current forward discount.

(4) The survey data show that the respondents have since 1951 indeed
held an expected rate of depreciation substantially greater than the forward
discount. But interpreting their responses as true investor expectations, and
interpreting the excess over the forward premium as a negative risk premium,

raises several problems. First, if investors seriously expected the dollar to
depreciate so fast, why did they buy dollars? Second, the theory of exchange
risk says that the risk premium should generally be small and, for the dollar in
the 198Os, that it probably has moved in the positive direction.

(5) In the safe-haven theory, a perceived shift in country risk rather than
exchange risk might seem to explain many of the foregoing paradoxes. How-

ever, the covered differential between European and U.S. interest rates actu-

ally fJJ after 1982 suggesting that perceptions of country risk, if anything,
shifted against the United States.
The model of fundamentalists and chartists that we are proposing has been

designed to reconcile these conflicting conclusions. To begin with, we
hypothesize that the views represented in the American Express and Economist

6-month surveys are primarily fundamentalist, like the views of Krugman and
Marris (and most other economists). But it may be wrong to assume that inves-

tors' expectations are necessarily the ones reported in the B-month surveys or
that they are even homogeneous (as most of our models do). Expectations are
heterogeneous.

Our model suggests that the market gives heavy weight to the

chartists, whose expected rate of change in the value of the dollar has been on
average much closer to zero, perhaps even positive. Paradox (4) is answered if

- 16

-

fundamentalists' expectations are not the only ones determining positions that

investors take in the market.
The increasing dollar overvaluation after the interest differential peaked in
1962 would be explained by a falling market-expected rate of future deprecia-

tion, with no necessary basis in fundamentals, The market-expected rate of
depreciation declined over time, not necessarily because of any change in the
expectations held by chartists or fundamentalists, but rather because of a shift

in the weights assigned to the two by the portfolio managers, who are the
agents who take positions in the market and determine the exchange rate.
They gradually put less and less weight on the big-depreciation forecasts of the

fundamentalists, as these forecasts continue to be proven false, and more and
more weight on the chartists.
Before we proceed to show how such a model works, we offer one piece of

evidence that there is not a single homogeneous expected rate of depreciation

reflected in the survey data: the very short-term expectations (one-week and
two-week) reported in a third survey of market participants, by Money Market
Services, Inc., behave very differently from the medium-term expectations (3, 6,
or 12 month) reported in any of the three surveys.16

Table 3 shows expected depreciation (from all three surveys) at a variety of

time horizons. Perhaps most striking is a large fall in the standard deviation of

the mean as the forecast horizon increases.At the short end of the spectrum,
none of the means from the one-week forecasts is significantly different from

zero at the one percent level, and the standard deviations are large, ranging
from 4.2 percent to 9.1 percent.17 At the other extreme, the one-year forecast
'6.Forarnore extensive analysis of this survey data set, see Dorninguez (1986).
17
For all currencies combined, the standard deviation of the means treat the value of
each currency against the dollar as independent. To the extent that all the forecastscontain a common dollar component, these aggregate standard deviations are biased downward, so that the corresponding t statistics are overstated.

- 17 horizon, all of the means are highly significant with t statistics approaching 30,

and the standard deviations are below 0.6 percent. The intermediate horizons
conform to this pattern of decline.

A second striking fact is that the one-week and one-month surveys, which
were conducted only for 10/84 to 9/85, indicate that respondents on average

expected the dollar to appreciate, often at a rapid annual rate. During the
comparable period for which 12 month forecasts are available (1/85-4/85),
expected depreciation was still large and positive at 7.32 percent as well as
significant (t = 8.29).

These two facts suggest that there are far more consistent views about the

value of the dollar in the longer run than in the shorter run; while short-run

expectations may predict appreciation or depreciation at different times,
longer-run forecasts consistently call for substantial depreciation. It is as if
there are actually two models of the dollar operating, one at each end of the
spectrum, and a blend in between. The fundamentalist model, for which we
specify a Dornbusch overshooting model, can be identified with the longer-run
expectations. The chartist model, a simple ARIMA forecasting equation such as

a random walk, might be identified with the shorter run. Under this view,
respondents use some weighted average of the two models in formulating their

expectations for the value of the dollar at a given future date, with the weights
depending on how far off that date is.

These results suggest an alternative interpretation of how chartist and
fundamentalist views are aggregated in the marketplace, an aggregation that
takes place without the benefit of portfolio managers. It is possible that the
chartists are simply people who tend to think short-term and the fundamental-

ists are people who tend to think long-term. For example, the former may by
profession be "traders", people who buy and sell foreign exchange on a short-

- 18 -

term basis and have evolved diflerent ways of thinking than the tatter, who may

by profession buy and hold longer-term securities.16

In any case, one could interpret the two groups as taking positions in the

market directly, rather than merely issuing forecasts for the portfolio
managers to read. The market price of foreign exchange would then be deter-

mined by demand coming from both groups. But the weights that the market

gives to the two change over time, according to the groups' respective
wealths.19 If the fundamentalists sell the dollar short and keep losing money,
while the chartists go long and keep gaining, in the long run the fundamental-

ists will go bankrupt and there will only be chartists in the marketplace. The

model that we develop in the next section pursues the portfolio manager's
decision-making problem instead of the marketplace-aggregation idea, but the
two are similar in spirit.

Yet another possible interpretation of the survey data is that the two ways
of thinking represent conflicting forces within the mind of a single representative agent.

When respondents answer the longer-term surveys they give the

views that their economic reason tells them are correct. When they get into the

trading room they give greater weight to their instincts, especially if past bets
based on their economic reason have been followed by ruinous "negative reinforcement." A respondent may think that when the dollar begins its plunge, he
or she will be able to get out before everyone else does. This opposing instinc-

tual force comes out in the survey only when the question pertains to the very
short term--one or two weeks; it would be too big a contradiction for his consci-

ence if a respondent were to report a one-week expectation of dollar depreciaIt sounds strange to describe 3 to 6 months as "long-term." But such descriptions are
common in the foreign exchange markets.

tion that was (proportionately) just as big as the answer to the 6-month ques-

tion1 at the same time that he or she was taking a long position in dollars.
Again, we prefer the interpretation where the survey reflects the true expectations of the respondent, and the market trading is done by some higher authority; but others may prefer the more complex psychological interpretation.

The fragments of empirical evidence in Table 3 are the only ones we will
offer by way of testing our approach. The aim in what follows is to construct a

model that reconciles the apparent contradictions discussed in Section 2.
There will be no hypothesis testing in any sense.

We think of the value of the dollar as being driven by the decisions of portfolio managers who use a weighted average of the expectations of fundamental-

ists and chartists.

- 20 Table 4 contains estimates of

from the late 1970s to the present. (There

are, unfortunately, no survey data for 1980.) The table indicates a preponderance of fundamentalism in the late seventies; portfolio managers gave almost
complete weight to this view. But beginning in 1981, as the dollar began to rise,

the forward discount increased less rapidly than fundamentalists' expected

depreciation, indicating that the market (or the portfolio managers in our
story) was beginning to pay less attention to the fundamentalists' view. By
1985, the market's expected depreciation had fallen to about zero. According
to these computations, fundamentalists are being completely ignored.

While the above scenario solves the paradox posed in proposition (4), it
leaves unanswered the question of how the weight w, which appears to have fal-

len dramatically since the late 1970s, is determined by portfolio managers.
Furthermore, if portfolio managers have small risk premia, and thus expect
depreciation at a rate close to that predicted by the forward discounts we still

must account for the spectacular rise of the dollar (proposition (1)), and
resolve how the rationally expected depreciation differs from the forward
discount (propositions (2) and (3)).
4. Portfolio Managers and the Dollar

Up to this point we have characterized the chartist and fundamentalist
views of the world, and hinted at the approximate mix that portfolio managers

would need to use if the market risk premium is to be near zero. We now turn
to an examination of the behavior of portfolio managers, and to the determination of the equilibrium spot rate. In particular, we first focus exclusively on the

dynamics of the spot rate which are generated by the changing expectations of

portfolio managers. We then extend the framework to include the evolution of
fundamentals which eventually must bring the dollar back down.

- 21 4.1. Expectations and Exchange Rate Dynamics

A general model of exchange rate determination can be written
+

(3)

where s(t) is the log of the spot rate, LsS1 is the rate of depreciation expected
by "the market" (portfolio managers) and ; represents other contemporaneous
determinants. This very general formulation, in which the first term can be

thought of as speculative factors and the second as fundamentals, has been
used by Mussa (1976) and Kohlhagen (1979). An easy way to interpret equation
(3) is in terms of the monetary model of Mussa (1976), F'renkel (1976) and Bil-

son (1978). Then c would be interpreted as the semi-elasticity of money
demand with respect to the alternative rate of return (which could be the
interest differential, expected depreciation or expected inflation differential;

the three are equal if uncovered interest parity and purchasing power parity
hold), and ;would be interpreted as the log of the domestic money supply relative to the foreign (minus the log of relative income, or any other determinants

of real money demand). An interpretation of equation (3) in terms of the
portfolio-balance approach is slightly more awkward because of nonlinearity.
But we could define

;d —f —c(i —i')
where

(4)

is the log of the supply of domestic assets (including not only money

i

but also bonds and other assets), f is the log of the supply of foreign assets,
and i —

is the nominal interest differential. Then equation (3) can be

derived as a linear approximation to the solution for the spot rate in a system

where the share of the portfolio allocated to foreign assets depends on the
expected return differential or risk premium, i —

— As1 .

If investors

diversify their portfolios optimally, c can be seen to depend inversely on the

- 22

-

variance of the exchange rate and the coefficient of relative risk-aversion.20 In

any case, the key point behind equation (3), common throughout the asset-

market view of exchange rates, is that an increase in the expected rate of
future depreciation will reduce demand for the currency today, and therefore
wilt cause it to depreciate today.

The present paper imbeds in the otherwise standard asset pricing model
given by equation (3) a form of market expectations that follows equation (1).

That is, we assume that portfolio managers' expectations are a weighted average of the expectations of fundamentalists, who think the spot rate regresses to

long-run equilibrium, and the expectations of chartists who use time series
methods:
in

We define A to be the logarithm of the long-run equilibrium rate and iS to be the

speed of regression of s to

(5)

In the context of some standard versions of equation (3) -- the monetary
model of Dornbusch (1976) in which goods prices adjust slowly over time or the
portfolio-balance models in which the stock of foreign assets adjusts slowly over
time -- it can be shown that equation (5) might be precisely the rational form

for expectations to take if there were no chartists in the market,

= 1. Unfor-

tunately for the fundamentalists, the distinction is crucial; equation (5) will not
be rational given the complete model.

s(t)), implies that ii = 1/ (fl—c) and

a ñ. It is then straightforward to show that i3 can be rational within the Dornbusch (1976) overshooting model.21

In the second group of models (Kouri (1976) and Rodriguez (1980) are

references), overshooting occurs because the stock of net foreign assets
adjusts slowly through current account surpluses or deficits. A monetary
expansion creates an imbalance in investors' portfolios which can be resolved
only by an initial increase in the value of net foreign assets. This sudden depre-

ciation of the domestic currency sets in motion an adjustment process in which

the level of net foreign assets increases and the currency appreciates to its
new steady-state level. In such a model (which is similar to the simulation
model below), the rate of adjustment of the spot rate, i, may also be rational, if

there are no chartists. Repeating equation (6) but using the log of the stock of

net foreign assets instead of the interest differential as the important fundamental, we have in continuous time:

s(t)=a+c(i—s(t—df(t)

(7)

Suppose the actual rate of depreoiation is (t) = v(.c — s(t)). Equation (7) then

can be rewritten in terms of deviations from the steady-state levels of the
exchange rate and net foreign assets, ñ and T.

4.2. The Model with Exogenous Fundamentals

We now turn to describe the model, assuming for the time being that
important fundamentals remain fixed. Regardless of which specification we use

for the fundamentals, the existence of chartists whose views are given timevarying weights by the portfolio managers complicates the model. For simplicity1 we study the case in which the chartists believe the exchange rate follows
a random walk, ts÷1 =

0.

Thus equation (1) becomes
=

w6(i s)
—

(la)

Since the changing weights by themselves generate self-sustaining dynamics.
the expectations of fundamentalists will no longer be rational, except for the

trivial case in which fundamentalist and chartist expectations are the same,

i5=0.
The "bubble" path of the exchange rate will be driven by the dynamics of
portfolio managers' expected depreciation. We assume that the weight given to
fundamentalist views by portfolio managers, co evolves according to:

One interpretation for 6 is that it is chosen by portfolio managers who use

realizations of the spot process. This leads to an expression for 6 which
changes over time. To simplify the following analysis we assume that 6 is constant; in the first appendix we explore more precisely the problem that portfolio

The restrictions that are imposed when co(t) =

0

and co(t) = 1 are to keep co(t)

from moving outside the interval [0,1]. These restrictions are in the spirit of
the portfolio managers choice set: the portfolio manager can at most take one
view or the other exclusively.

The evolution of the spot rate can be expressed by taking the derivative of
equation (3) (for now holding z and the long-run equilibrium, ä, constant)

(t) =

1 + cilw(t)

Equations (14) and (15) can be solved simultaneously and rewritten, for interior

(16)

(17)

In principle, an analytic solution to the differential equation (16) could be

substituted into (17), and then (17) could be integrated directly.22 For our pur-

poses it is more desirable to use a finite difference method to simulate the
motion of the system. In doing so we must pick values for the coefficients,
c,6 and 6, and starting values for w(t) and s(t).

To exclude any unreasonable time paths implied by equations (15) and
(17), we impose the obvious sign restrictions on the coefficients. The parameter

13 must be positive and less than one if expectations are to be regressive, that
is, if they are to predict a return to the long-run equilibrium at a finite rate. By

In this case however, u(t) does not have a closed analytic form.

definition,

6 and w(t)

lie

in the interval [o,i] since they are weights. The

coefficient c measures the responsiveness of the spot rate to changes in
expected depreciation and must be positive to be sensible.

These restrictions, however, are not enough to determine unambiguously
the sign of the denominator of equations (16) and (17). The three possibilities

are that: 1 + cijw(t)

— c5c

>

If 1 + ciii(t)

<0 for all co; 1 + cco(t) — ôc >0 for all w; and

>
— óc C 0,

the system will be stable and will tend to return to

the long-run equilibrium from any initial level of the spot rate. This might be
the case if portfolio managers use only the most recent realization of the spot
rate to choose co(t), that is, if 6

1. If, on the other hand, portfolio managers

give substantial weight to prior information so that 6 is small, the expression
1 + c'5w(t)

— ôc

will be positive. In this case the spot rate will tend to move

away from the long-run equilibrium if it is perturbed.

Let us assume that portfolio managers are slow learners.24 What does this

assumption imply about the path of the dollar? If we take as a starting point
the late 1970s, when s(t)

s'r and when

1 (as the calculations presented in

25 We

do not consider the third case, because equations (16) and (17) are not defined at
—
= 0.
24 The following intuition may help see why the system is stable when portfolio managers
are "fast" learners and unstable when they are "slow" learners. Suppose the value of the

1 + c6c..(t)

dollar is above s, so that portfolio managers are predicting depreciation at the rate

c,nI(c—s (t )). If the spot rate were to start depreciating at a rate slightly faster than this,
portfolio managers would then shift co(t) upwards, in favor of the fundamentalists. Under
what circumstances would these hypothesized dynamics be an equilibrium? Recall from
equations (14) and (15) that if 6 is big, portfolio managers place substantial weight on new
information. The larger is 6, the more quickly the spot rate changes. It is easy to show

that it portfolio managers are fast learners (i.e., if 6 > 1/c + ow), they update W so rapidly that the resulting rate of depreciation must in fact be greater than w3(s —s (t)).
Thus the system is stable. Alternatively, if portfolio managers are "slow" learners,
a c 1/ C + '5w, they heavily discount new information and therefore change w(t) too
slowly to generate a rate of depreciation greater then wi3(—s (t)). lii we instead hy-

pothesize an initial rate of depreciation which is less than wii(sb —s(t )), portfolio

managers would tend to shift W downwards, more towards the chartists. From equation
(15), a negative w(t) causes the spot rate to appreciate. Thus slow learning will tend to
drive the spot rate further away from the long-run equilibrium (given 0 C C) C 1), making
the system unstable.

- 28 Table

4 suggest), equation (17) says that the spot rate is in equilibrium, that

ê(t) = 0. From equation (14b), we see that ci(t) =

0 as well.

Thus the system

is in a steady-state equilibrium, with market expectations exclusively reflecting
the views of fundamentalists.

But given that 1 4- ci3w(t) — i5c > 0, this equilibrium is unstable, and any

shock starts things in motion. Suppose that there is an unanticipated appreci-

ation (the unexpected persistence of high long-term US interest rates in the
early 1980s, for example). The sign restrictions imply that c,(t) is unambiguously falling over time. Equation (16) says that the chartists are gaining prominence, since c.3(t)

<

0. The exchange rate begins to trace out a bubble path,

moving away from long-run equilibrium; equation (17) shows that th(t) < 0 when

1> s(t).

This process cannot, however, go on forever, because market expecta-

tions are eventually determined only by chartist views. At this point the bubble

dynamics die out since both (t) and c(t) fall to zero. From equation (17), the
spot rate then stops moving away from long-run equilibrium, as it approaches a
new, higher equilibrium level where ñ(t) = 0. In the words of Dornbusch (1983),

the exchange rate is both high and stuck.

Figures 1 and 2 trace out a 'base-case simulation of the time profile of the
spot rate and w.

They are intended only to suggest that the model can poten-

tially account for a large and sustained dollar appreciation. The figures assume

that the dollar is perturbed out of a steady state equilibrium where ñ = s (t)
and c..,(O)

1 in October 1980. The dollar rises at an decreasing rate until some-

time in 1985, when, as can be seen in Figure 2, the simulated weight placed on

fundamentalist expectations becomes negligible. A steady state obtains at a
new higher level, about 31 percent above the long-run equilibrium implied by
purchasing power parity. Although we tried to choose reasonable values for the

parameters used in this example, the precise level of the plateau and the rate

which the currency approaches it are sensitive to different choices of

parameters. in the second appendix we give more detail on values used in the
simulation.

It is worth emphasizing that the equilibrium spot rate appreciates along its

bubble path even though none of the actors expects appreciation. This result is
due to the implicit stock adjustment taking place. As portfolio managers reject

their fundamentalist roots, they reshuffle their portfolios to hold a greater
share in dollar assets. For fixed relative asset supplies, a greater dollar share
can be obtained in equilibrium only by additional appreciation. This unexpected appreciation, in turn, further convinces portfolio managers to embrace
chartism. The rising dollar becomes self-sustaining. In the end, when the spiral

finally levels off at (t)

= 0,

the level at which the currency becomes stuck

represents a fully rational equilibrium: portfolio managers expect zero depreciation and the rate of change of the exchange rate is indeed zero.

What we term the irrationality of the model can be seen by inspecting
equation (17).

Recall that market expected depreciation, that of portfolio

managers, is a weighted average of chartist and fundamentalist expectations,
—

s(t)). But the actual, or rational, expected rate of depreciation is
—o

given by ——
1 + ci5co(t) —
= Q•25 The

co(t)ii(i — s(t)). The two are not equal, unless

problem we gave portfolio managers was to pick co(t) in a way that

best describes the spot process they observe (together with the prior
confidence they had in fundamentalist predictions). But theirs is a thankless
task, since the spot process is more complicated.

25

There is a second root, w = — 1/ (or), which we rule out since it is less than zero.

- 30 4.3. The Model with Endogenous Fundamentals

The results so far oiler an explanation for the paradox of proposition (1),
that sustained dollar appreciation occurs even though all agents expect depreciation. But a spot rate that is stuck at a disequilibrium level is an unlikely end

for any reasonable story. The next step is to specify the mechanism by which
the unsustainability of the dollar is manifest in the model.
The most obvious fundamental which must eventually force the dollar down

is the stock of net foreign assets. Reductions in this stock, through large
current account deficits, cannot take place indefinitely. Sustained borrowing

would, in the long run, raise the level of debt above the present discounted
value of income. But long before this point of insolvency is reached, the gains
from a U.S. policy aimed at reducing the outstanding liabilities (either through
direct taxes or penalties on capital, or through monetization) would increase in

comparison to the costs. If foreigners associate large current account deficits
with the potential for moral hazard, they would treat U.S. securities as increasingly risky and would force a decline in the level of the dollar.

To incorporate the effects of current account imbalances, we consider the
model, similar to Rodriguez (1980), given in equation (7):

sra+c&1df

(is)

is defined in equation (la) and where f represents the log of
cumulated US current account balances. The coeff1cient, ci, is the semi-

where

elasticity of the spot rate with respect to transfers of wealth, and must be positive to be sensible. The differential equations (16) and (17) now become:

If we were to follow the route of trying to solve analytically the system of
differential equations, we would add a third equation giving the "normalized"

current account, J, as a function of s(t).

for example, equation (9)
above.) But we here instead pursue the simulation approach.
(See,

In the simulation we use actual current account data for J, the change in

the stock of net foreign assets. Figures 3 and 4 trace out paths for the
differential equations (19) and (20). During the initial phases of the dollar
appreciation, the current account, which responds to the appreciation with a

lag, does not noticeably affect the rise of the dollar. But as becomes small,

the spot rate becomes more sensitive to changes in the level of the current
account, and the external deficits of 1983-1985 quickly turn the trend. When
is small and portfolio managers observe an incipient depreciation of the dollar,

they begin to place more weight on the forecasts of fundamentalists, thus
accelerating the depreciation initiated by the current account deficits. There
is a "fundamentalist revival." Ironically, fundamentalists are initially driven

out of the market as the dollar appreciates, even though they are ultimately
right about its return to ñ.
Naturally, all of our results are sensitive to the precise parameters chosen.

To gain an idea of the various sensitivities, we report in Table 5 results using
alternative sets of parameter values in the simulation of Figure 3 (or equation
(20)). While there is some variation, the qualitative pattern of bubble appreciation, followed by a slow turnaround and bubble depreciation, remains evident in
all cases.

Recall that one of the main aims of the model is to account for the two

seemingly contradictory facts given by propositions (2) and (3): first that
market efficiency test results imply that the rationally expected rate of dollar
depreciation has been less than the forward discount, and second that the cal-

culations based on fundamentals, such as those by Krugman and Marris. imply

that the rationally expected rate of depreciation, by 1985, became greater than
the forward discount.

Table 6 clarifies how the model resolves this paradox. The first two lines

show the expectations of our two forecasters, the chartists and fundamentalists. The third line repeats the six-month survey expectations to demonstrate
that they may in fact be fairly well described by the simple regressive formula-

tion we use to represent fundamentalist expectations in line two. The fourth

line contains the expected depreciation of the portfolio managers. Note that
these expectations are close to the forward discount in line six, even though

the forecasts of the fundamentalists and of the chartists are not. Since only
the portfolio managers are hypothesized to take positions in the market, we can

say that the magnitude of the market risk premium is small (as mean-variance
optimization would predict). Finally, line five shows the actual depreciation in

the simulation, which is equivalent to the rationally expected depreciation
given the model above. (Of course, none of the agents has the entire model in

his information set.) Notice that during the 1981-1984 period, the rationally
expected depreciation is not only significantly less than the forward discount,

but less than zero. This pattern agrees with the results of market efficiency
tests discussed earlier. But the rationally expected depreciation is increasing
over time. Sometime in late 1984 or early 1985, the rationally expected rate of

depreciation becomes positive and crosses the forward discount. As calculations of the Krugman-Marris type would indicate, rationally expected deprecia-

tion is now greater than the forward discount. The paradox of propositions (2)
and (3) is thus resolved within the model.

All this comes at what might seem a high cost: portfolio managers behave

irrationally in that they do not use the entire model in formulating their

rate forecasts.

But another interpretation of this behavior is pos-

sible1 in that portfolio managers are actually doing thc best they can in a
confusing world. Within this framework they cannot have been more rational:
abandoning fundamentalism more quickly would not solve the problem in the

sense that their expectations would not be validated by the resulting spot pro-

cess in the long run. In trying to learn about the world after a regime change,
our portfolio managers use convex combinations of models which are already
available to them and which hasre worked in the past. In this context, rational-

ity is the rather strong presumption that one of the prior models is correct. It
is hard to imagine how agents, after a regime change, would know the correct
model.

- 34 5.

Conclusions and Extensions

This paper has posed an unorthodox explanation for the recent aerobatics
of the dollar. The model we use assumes less than fully rational behavior in the

sense that none of the three classes of actors (chartists, fundamentalists and
portfolio managers) condition their forecasts on the full information set of the

model. In effect, the bubble is the outcome of portfolio managers' attempt to
learn the modeL When the bubble takes off (and when it collapses), they are
learning more slowly about the model than they are changing it by revising the

linear combination of chartist and fundamentalist views they incorporate in

their own forecasts. But as the weight given to fundamentalists approaches
zero or one, portfolio managers' estimation of the true force changing the dollar comes closer to the true one. These revisions in weights become smaller

until the approximation is perfect: portfolio managers have "caught up," by
changing the model more slowly than they learn. In this sense the inability of

agents with prior information to bring about immediate convergence to a
rational expectations equilibrium may provide a framework in which to view
"bubbles" in a variety of asset markets.

Several extensions of the model in this paper would be worthwhile. First, it

would be desirable to allow chartists to use a class of predictors richer than a
simple random walk. They might form their forecasts of future depreciation by
using ARIMA models, for example. Simple bandwagon or distributed lag expec-

tations for chartists would be the most plausible since they capture a wide
range of effects and are relatively simple analytically. Second. we might want to
consider extensions which give the model local stability in the neighborhood of
= 1.

Small perturbations from equilibrium would then not instantly cause
portfolio managers to begin losing faith in fundamentalist counsel. Only
Co

sufficiently large or prolonged perturbations, would upset portfolio managers'

- 35 views

enough to cause the exchange rate to break free of its fundamental

equilibrium.

- 35 -

6. APPENDIX 1

In this section we consider the problem which portfolio managers face:how
much weight should they give to new information concerning the 'true' level of
co(t).

After we obtain an explicit formulation for these optimal Bayesian

weights, we report their effects on the simulated path of the dollar.

Even though in the model of the spot rate given by equation (3) the value

of the currency is fully deterministic, individual portfolio managers who are

unable to predict accurately ex ante changes in the spot rate may view the
future spot rate as random. They would then form predictions of future depre-

ciation on the basis of observed exchange rate changes and their prior beliefs.
At each point in time, portfolio managers therefore view future depreciation as

the sum of their current optimal predictor and a random term,
=

cot(i—s) +

(Al)

where t1 is a serially uncorrelated normal random variable with mean 0 and
variance 'o(c — 1) / r.26 Using Bayes' rule, the coefficient w may be written
as a weighted average of the previous period's estimate, c,, and information
obtained from the contemporaneous realization of the spot rate,

Thus,

if portfolio managers use Bayesian techniques, the
weight they would give to the current period's information may be expressed as

particularly
expression for2ô (equation (A2) below). Under the assumption

is the precision of portfolio managers' prior information.27 Equation

(A3) shows that the weight which portfolio managers give to new information
would fall over time as decision makers gain more confidence in their prior dis-

tribution, or as the prior distribution for the future change in the spot rate
converges to the actual posterior distribution. If, however, portfolio managers

suspect that the spot rate is nonstationary, past information would be
discounted relative to more recent observations. Instead of combining prior
information in the form of an OLS regression of actual depreciation on fundamentalist expectations (as they do above), portfolio managers might use a vary-

ing parameter technique to take into account the nonstationarity. In this case,
the weight they put on new information might not decline over time to zero.

Computing 6 using equation (A3) does not change substantially the results

of the simulations presented in the text. Nevertheless the following pages con-

tain the outcome of simulations using Bayesian 6's. Figures 5 and 6 give s(t)
and

co(t) holding fundamentals constant (note that the spot rate approaches

the higher equilibrium more slowly than in the comparable figures in the text,
Figures 1 and 2). Figures 7 and S add to this changing fundamentals according

to equations (19) and (20) in the text. Table 7 reports the simulated expectations of our three sets of agents as well as the rationally expected depreciation,
comparable to Table S in the text.

- 38 7. APPENDIX 2

In this appendix we discuss our choices of important parameters used in
the simulations.

The coefficient on expected depreciation in equation (3), c, may be inter-

preted as the semi-elasticity of demand for domestic assets with respect to
alternative (foreign) rates of return. Bilson (1985), for example, interprets c

as

equal to Cagan's semi-elasticity of money demand. Under the assumptions that

the interest elasticity of the demand for money is .15 and that interest rates
are approximately 1 percent per month Bilson uses c =

15.

Other possible esti-

mates for c are much higher. An estimate of the semi-elasticity c may be
obtained in a mean-variance framework. c then depends on the relative shares

of assets in the market portfolio, the variance of the spot rate, and the
coefficient of relative risk aversion. Estimates of c

(see

Frankel (1985), Table

ba) range from 1,800 to 43,800 for various currencies and estimates of portfolio

shares. Our choice is somewhere in between Bilson's and Frankel's, c

25.

Higher values of a tend to exaggerate the rate appreciation of the dollar and
also the rate at which c.'1 falls (see Table 5 in the text).

The coefficient 5 measures the rate at which portfolio managers "learn:" it

is the weight they give to new information about the value of w. A crucial
assumption of the model is that portfolio managers do put weight on their prior

estimate of c.'. If they learn too quickly, the spot rate will be stable and no
bubbles will occur. In the simulations in the text, we assume that S = .03, or

that portfolio managers mix the information of the current month's c with
data from the past three years.
The parameter 19, controls the speed with which the spot rate is expected

to regress to i. In the simulations we chose ii = .045, which means fundamentalists expect about 60 percent of the current deviation from s to remain after

- 39

-

year. Regression estimates of i5 from exchange rate survey data in Frankel

and Froot (1985) are somewhat smaller (about .02), but in that paper the
specification for expected depreciation also included a constant term (i.e.
a + i(i — s(t))) which was significantly positive (about .01). After
including the constant, the surveys predict a somewhat faster return to long-

run equilibrium, that only 50 percent of the current overvaluatjon would
remain after one year. The choice of i = .045 has the added advantage that the

expectations of fundamentalists in the simulation appear very similar to the
survey expected depreciation (see Tables 8 and 7, lines two and three).
