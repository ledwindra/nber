Fiscal Remedies for Japan’s Slump

JEL No. E3, E6
ABSTRACT
This paper asks how a fiscal expansion would affect Japan. It uses a textbook-style macro model
calibrated to fit the Japanese economy. According to the results, Japan’s output slump would be
ended by a fiscal transfer of 6.6% of GDP. This policy raises the debt-income ratio in the short run,
but it reduces this ratio in the long run through higher inflation and tax revenue. The financing of
the transfer -- bonds or money -- affects debt in the short run but not the long run.

I. INTRODUCTION
When an economy slumps, policymakers typically stimulate
demand by reducing short-term interest rates.

Japan’s experience

in the last decade has renewed interest in an old question: what
to do when rates can’t be lowered.

stimulate demand?
The textbook remedy for a liquidity trap is a fiscal
expansion.

Japanese policy is complicated, however, by a large

and rising government debt.

This problem led the major rating

agencies to downgrade Japan’s debt in 2002.

Policymakers resist

a fiscal expansion because they believe it would exacerbate the
debt problem.
Others, however, argue for a fiscal expansion.

Kuttner and

Posen (2001) suggest that this policy would not only boost output
but also have benign effects on Japan’s debt problem.

They argue

that Japan’s large budget deficits have mainly been caused by its
output slump.

By ending the slump, a fiscal expansion would

eventually raise tax revenues, and higher inflation would reduce
the real value of debt.

These effects would offset the direct

costs of a fiscal expansion.
Several advocates of a fiscal expansion suggest a twist:
1

money finance (e.g. Mankiw, 1999; Stevens, 2001).

They advocate

a “helicopter drop” of money – or, equivalently, a bond-financed
fiscal expansion coupled with purchases of the new debt by the
central bank.

Monetization of the debt would eliminate the

direct fiscal costs of the policy, leaving only the benefits from
economic stimulus.

Bernanke (2003) summarizes the argument for a

money-financed tax cut:
Isn’t it irresponsible to recommend a tax cut, given the
poor state of Japanese public finances? To the contrary,
from a fiscal perspective, the policy would almost certainly
be stabilizing, in the sense of reducing the debt-to-GDP
ratio. The BOJ’s purchases would leave the nominal quantity
of debt in the hands of the public unchanged, while nominal
GDP would rise owing to increased nominal spending. Indeed,
nothing would help reduce Japan’s fiscal woes more than
healthy growth in nominal GDP and hence in tax revenues.
This paper examines these ideas.

It uses a textbook-style

macro model calibrated to fit the Japanese economy.

The model’s

initial conditions are based on the situation in 2003.

I

determine the fiscal transfer needed to boost output to
potential, and derive the effects over time on output, inflation,
and the debt-income ratio.

I compare results for a bond-financed

transfer, a money-financed transfer, and a baseline case with
passive fiscal policy.

In most exercises, I assume monetary

policy follows a Taylor rule once interest rates become positive.
The results are generally favorable to fiscal expansions.
For base parameter values, a transfer of 6.6% of GDP returns
output to potential in the following year, and thereafter only
2

small transfers are needed to keep it there.

The output recovery

ends deflation, and the interest rate becomes positive; then the
Taylor rule guides the economy to a steady state with low
positive inflation.

If the fiscal transfer is financed with

bonds, the debt-income ratio jumps up when the transfer occurs,
but then it falls as output and inflation rise.

Two years after

the transfer, the debt-income ratio falls below its level under
passive policy, and it remains lower in steady state.

Thus the

transfer improves the long-run fiscal situation as well as ending
the output slump.
Does it matter if the fiscal expansion is financed with
money rather than debt?

Money finance prevents the debt-income

ratio from jumping up when the transfer occurs.

For base

parameter values, this ratio remains lower with money finance
than with debt finance for nine years.

In year ten, however, the

debt paths under the two policies converge.

The initial

financing of the transfer is irrelevant in the long run.
These results arise because the Taylor rule becomes
operative in year 10.

In that year the central bank sets a

positive interest rate, which requires a contraction of the
monetary base.

It reduces the base by selling government bonds.

The necessary contraction is larger if the initial transfer was
money-financed, and the extra sales of debt offset the initial
3

savings from monetization.
The rest of this paper contains seven sections.

Section II

presents additional background and Section III presents the
model.

Sections IV-VI derive the implications of passive fiscal

policy, debt-financed transfers, and money financed transfers.
Section VII considers robustness and Section VIII concludes.

II. BACKGROUND
This section reviews Japan’s recent history and the debate
over fiscal policy.
A. Japan’s Slump
Figure 1 presents annual data on Japan’s economy from 1990
to 2003.

I use the experience of this period to guide my

modeling of the economy.
Table I.

The situation in 2003 is summarized in

In simulating alternative policies, I use data from

2003 as initial conditions.
The top panel of the Figure shows the log of real output.
Output growth averaged 1.3% per year over 1990-2003, compared to
4.0% from 1980 to 1990.

Early in the slump, some blamed it on

slow growth of potential output due to “structural” factors.
Today, however, most economists agree that output has fallen
below potential because of deficient demand.

Apparent demand

shocks include a collapse in asset prices, a credit crunch, and
policy mistakes (e.g. Hoshi and Kashyap, 2004; Posen, 2004).

4

There is, of course, uncertainty about the gap between
output and potential output.

Following McCallum (2000) and

Hoshi-Kashyap, Figure 1 presents a path for potential based on
the assumption that it has grown 2% per year since 1990.
approach produces an output gap of -9% in 2003.

This

Using production

functions, some researchers have estimated recent gaps of around
-5% (e.g. Ahearne et al, 2002; Leigh, 2004).

In my simulations,

I assume an initial output gap of -7.5%.
Figure 1 also shows inflation, as measured by the GDP
deflator and by core CPI.

The slump of the 90s dragged inflation

down, as predicted by the accelerationist Phillips curve.

In

2000, inflation reached about -1% (a bit higher for the CPI and a
bit lower for the deflator).
fairly constant.

Since then, inflation has remained

I use -1% as the initial value of inflation.

The stability of inflation since 2000 is not consistent with
a conventional Phillips curve.

Such an equation predicts

accelerating deflation when the output gap is negative.

The

cause of this anomaly is unclear, but Blanchard (2000) suggests
one possibility.

The accelerationist Phillips curve is based on

the assumption that expected inflation equals past inflation.
This relation breaks down if people view deflation as transitory
– if they expect a return to non-negative inflation.

In this

case, an output slump causes deflation but not accelerating

5

deflation.

I will incorporate this idea in the paper’s model.1

The last two panels of Figure 1 show the behavior of
monetary policy.

The BOJ responded to the slump and falling

inflation by cutting the short-term interest rate.

Leigh (2004)

shows that a conventional Taylor rule captures this behavior up
to 1998.

At that point, the Taylor-rule interest rate became

negative, and the actual rate hit the zero bound.

The interest

rate has stayed close to zero since then.
The monetary base grew steadily as the interest rate fell.
Base growth accelerated under the policy of “quantitative
easing,” which entailed large open-market operations.
grew 26% in 2002 and 16% in 2003, reaching 20% of GDP.

The base
With the

interest rate stuck at zero, this monetary expansion did not have
obvious effects on output or inflation.

This experience is

consistent with a textbook liquidity trap.
B. A Fiscal Solution?
The classic solution to a liquidity trap is a fiscal
expansion.

However, Japanese policymakers are reluctant to try

this policy, for two reasons.

First, many argue that fiscal

policy is ineffective in raising output.

Second, they fear that

a fiscal expansion would exacerbate the problem of a growing

the 1990s. See Fukao (2004).

national debt.
This paper rejects the first reason.

It is based on the

view that Japan tried fiscal expansions in the 1990s without
success (e.g. Friedman, 2001).

This view has been debunked by

Posen (1998) and Kuttner and Posen (2001).

They show that

several “expansion” programs failed because they were not really
expansions – they consisted mainly of normal expenditures.

There

were large fiscal deficits, but these mainly reflected revenue
losses caused by the slump.

In periods of true fiscal loosening,

such as 1995, output responded.
Kuttner and Posen also estimate multipliers for fiscal
policy in Japan.

They use the structural VAR approach of

Blanchard and Perotti (2002), which controls for the cyclical
behavior of deficits.

Kuttner and Posen find that a 100 yen tax

cut raises output one year later by about 125 yen.
This paper will worry more about the second objection to
fiscal expansion: its effects on Japan’s public debt.

Figure 2

shows the path of net government debt as a percent of GDP.

This

ratio rose from 0.13 in 1991 to 0.79 in 2003, and forecasters
predict that it will continue to rise.

Long-term budget

projections are bleak because of Japan’s aging population.

Many

analysts fear an eventual fiscal crisis, possibly even default.
As a result, Japan’s debt has been downgraded to A2/AA-, the

7

level for many developing countries.2
This paper will look for policies that end Japan’s slump
without worsening its debt problem.

I will ask whether a fiscal

transfer can do so –- whether the fiscal benefits from higher
output and inflation outweigh the direct costs of the transfer.
I will also consider the effects of financing the transfer with
money rather than bonds.

III. THE MODEL
Japan’s problems are largely explained by textbook macro
models.

A fall in aggregate demand has reduced output, and

monetary policy is ineffective because the interest rate has hit
zero.

Kuttner and Posen say “the basic lesson of Japan’s Great

Recession for policymakers is to trust what you learned in
intermediate macroeconomics class.”

In that spirit, I study a

model with textbook equations such as an IS curve and a money
2

According to the OECD, Japan’s gross government debt for 2003 was 157% of GDP
and government assets were 78%, yielding net debt of 79%. Broda and Weinstein (2004)
suggest two adjustments to this figure. Like this paper, they view the government and the central
bank as the same entity, and thus subtract government bonds owned by the central bank. This
reduces net debt by 16% of GDP. Second, they add bad loans from the government to the
private sector, which by coincidence are also 16% of GDP. The two adjustments cancel, so net
debt is still 79%.

demand function.

I add simple dynamics following Svensson (1997)

and Ball (1999).

The only unorthodox equation is the Phillips

curve, which is modified to capture Japan’s steady deflation.
A. Assumptions
Output: Potential output Y* grows by g percent per year.
Actual output Y deviates from potential according to an IS
equation:
(1)

(Yt-Y*t)/Y*t

=

λ(Yt-1-Y*t-1)/Y*t-1 - β(rt-1-r*t-1)
+ δ(Gt-1/Y*t-1),

where t indexes years, G is real transfers from the government, r
is the real interest rate, r* is the “neutral” interest rate, and
all parameters are positive.

The real rate r is i-π, where i is

the nominal rate and π is inflation.

In words, the output gap

depends on the lagged gap, the lagged real interest rate, and
lagged transfers.

The one-year lags are consistent with Japanese

evidence (see Kuttner and Posen).
Inflation: Inflation is determined by an expectationsaugmented Phillips curve:
(2)

πt

=

πte + α(Yt-1-Y*t-1)/Y*t-1 ,

where πe is expected inflation.

A conventional assumption is

that expected inflation equals lagged inflation, πte = πt-1.
assume instead that
(3)

πte

=

max{πt-1, 0}.

I

The conventional assumption holds when lagged inflation is nonnegative, but expectations do not follow actual inflation below
zero.

When πt-1≥0, (2) and (3) imply that output determines the

change in inflation.

When πt-1<0, output determines the level of

inflation, as suggested by Blanchard.
Section VII replaces equation (3) with the assumption that
πte always equals πt-1.

This change does not greatly affect the

economy’s response to fiscal expansions.

It does change the
If πte=πt-1 and policy

is passive, the economy falls into a spiral of accelerating
deflation.
Money: The central bank controls the stock of base money, M,
through open-market operations.

Mt

Money evolves according to

Mt-1 + Zt ,

where Z is central-bank purchases of government bonds (Z<0 means
sales of bonds).

The demand for base money is given by

it = 0 ,

where P is the price level.

This equation imposes a unit income

elasticity of money demand (which is consistent with Japanese
data).

At positive interest rates, there is a constant interest-

rate semi-elasticity; at a zero interest rate, money demand
becomes flat.

Figure 3 shows the money demand function in a

graph.3
Debt: I measure Japan’s fiscal problem with privately-held
debt, which excludes debt held by the central bank.

Thus I

ignore the separate balance sheets of the government and central
bank and treat them as one entity.

Nominal debt Dt, evolves

according to
(6)

Dt

=

Dt-1 + it-1Dt-1 + PtGt - Zt - θ(PtYt - PtY*t) .

Debt is past debt plus changes from four sources: interest
payments on the past debt; current nominal transfers; open-market
purchases, which reduce debt; and a term for the government’s
primary surplus in the absence of transfers.

This surplus is

assumed to be zero when output equals potential (Yt=Yt*).

It

varies procyclically when output fluctuates.4
In reality, Japan’s primary surplus would probably be
3

It is common to specify a demand function like (5) for M1 rather than the monetary
base. This would not affect the analysis if one assumes a constant ratio of M1 to the base, i.e. a
constant money multiplier. This multiplier is fairly stable in Japan.
4

Equation (6) implicitly assumes that government debt has a maturity of one year. In
reality, much of Japan’s debt is long-term. Adding long-term debt to the model would
strengthen the case for fiscal expansion. As shown below, an expansion raises the path of
interest rates. Higher rates imply capital losses for holders of long-term debt, which are capital
gains for the government.

negative even if output were at potential.

Ignoring this fact

helps us isolate the effects of exogenous fiscal expansions.
Section VII extends the model to include a primary deficit when
Y=Y*.
B. Calibration
Table 2 presents base values for the model’s parameters.
Section VII considers robustness to changes in these parameters.
In the IS equation, I set β, the coefficient on the real
interest rate, to 1.0.

This follows Ball’s (1999) calibration

for the U.S. (I have not found Japanese evidence).

For the other

IS parameters, I use Kuttner and Posen’s econometric results.
They estimate that δ, the effect of lagged transfers on output,
is 1.25 and λ, the effect of lagged output, is 0.6.

The effect

of transfers is smaller than Blanchard and Perotti’s estimates
for the U.S.5
I also use Kuttner and Posen’s estimate of θ, the effect of
output on the primary surplus.

They find θ=0.25.

This appears

conservative, as taxes are 20% of Japanese output and marginal
taxes are higher than average taxes.
The Phillips curve slope, α, is 0.2.

5

This estimate comes

More precisely, Kuttner and Posen estimate an equation for log output, and get a
coefficient of -0.25 on log taxes. Dividing by the ratio of taxes to GDP (approximately 0.2)
yields the yen-for-yen effect of taxes and transfers on output.

from studies at the BOJ (e.g. Hirose and Kamada, 2002).

The

Phillips curve appears flatter in Japan than in the U.S., where α
is often estimated around 0.4.
In the money demand equation, the interest rate semielasticity, γ, is 0.1, based on estimates by Fujiki et al. (2002)
and Miyao (2002).

The parameter k is the point at which the

money demand curve hits an interest rate of zero.
using the historical evidence in Figure 1.

I calibrate it

When the interest

rate reached zero in 1998, the ratio of the monetary base to GDP
was about 0.1.

This implies k=ln(0.1).

The growth rate of potential output, g, is 2% per year.
C. The Neutral Interest Rate
It remains to calibrate the neutral real interest rate, r*.
This is a thorny issue.

There is debate about whether this

parameter is positive or negative in Japan (e.g. Krugman, 2000).
My view is that r* is currently negative, but unlikely to stay
negative forever.

My calibration will capture this idea.

The neutral interest rate is the one that produces Y=Y* in
the absence of a fiscal expansion.

It seems clear that r* has

been negative in the early 2000's.

The actual real rate has been

about 1% and Y has been far below Y*.
1%.

Thus r* must be well below

I assume an initial r* of -2%, which implies r-r* = 3%.

For

this value of r-r*, the output gap converges to -7.5% if there is
no fiscal transfer.

Thus the calibration captures the idea that
13

output is stuck at a low level.
It is unlikely, however, that r* will stay negative forever.
Iwamura et al. (2004) and Leigh (2004) estimate that r*
was well above zero before the 1990s, but fell during the 90s

The fall in r* means the IS curve shifted in.

It is likely that these problems will

confidence and improve balance sheets.

Whatever the reason, the

IS curve will shift back out and r* will return to a positive

hard to guess how quickly this will happen.

Of course it is

In the base

specification, I assume that r* rises linearly from -2% to +2%
over ten years.

The IS curve shifts outward, but slowly.

Since

this assumption is arbitrary, variations on the r* path are a top
priority among robustness checks.

IV. A BASELINE CASE
This section derives the path of the economy if there is no
fiscal expansion: Gt=0 for all t.

The economy starts in year 0

with the initial conditions in Table 2.

This exercise provides a

baseline for measuring the effects of fiscal policy.

14

A. Monetary Policy
To close the model, I must specify the behavior of monetary
policy.

I assume an interest-rate rule based on the past

behavior of the Bank of Japan.

Recall that the BOJ appeared to

follow a Taylor rule until the interest rate hit zero.

This

behavior is captured by
(7)

it

=

max{iTt, 0} ,

iTt = r*t + πt + a(Yt-Y*t)/Y*t + b(πt-π*) ,
where π* is an inflation target.

The variable iT is the interest

rate dictated by a Taylor rule: it depends on the output gap and
inflation.

The BOJ sets an interest rate of iT if iT is

positive, and zero if iT is negative.

BOJ officials have

suggested the same rule in describing their policy (Baba et al.,
2004).
When the rule delivers a positive interest rate, the money
demand equation determines M.
market purchases, Z.

M and lagged M determine open

When i=0, M is not determined by the rule,

because money demand is flat.

In this case, I make the

additional assumption that Z=0, so M equals lagged M.

That is, I

assume the BOJ does not pursue open-market operations if they do
not affect the interest rate.

(Section VI examines an

alternative assumption.)
In the Taylor rule, the coefficients a and b are chosen as
follows.

Taylor rules with certain parameters are equivalent to
15

“flexible” inflation targeting: a policy that returns inflation
to π* at a fixed rate (see Svensson [1997] and Ball [1999] for
proofs in similar models).

I assume that inflation moves halfway

to its target each period.

One can show that this implies a=1.1

and b=2.5.
I assume the inflation target π* is 2%, which is close to
the targets of many countries.
Given initial conditions and the policy rule, it is
straightforward to derive the evolution of the economy.

Each

period, Y and π are determined by past conditions through (1)Inflation π determines the price level P.

(3).

determines i, M, and Z, as described above.

The policy rule

Finally, equation

(6) determines D.
B. Results
Figure 4 shows the paths of some key variables: the output
gap, π, i, and the ratios of Z, M, and D to GDP.

Starting from

period 0, output stays in a deep slump for several years and then
slowly recovers as r* increases.

The output gap rises above -5%

in year 6, and it becomes positive in year 10.

From years 1 to

9, there is a cumulative output gap of -54%.
Inflation falls to -1.5% and then inches up as the economy
recovers.

It becomes positive in year 11.

Through that year the

Taylor rule prescribes a negative interest rate, so i is stuck at
zero.
16

In year 12, the recovery pushes the Taylor-rule interest
rate above zero.

The rule begins to operate, and it guides

inflation smoothly to the target of 2%.

Output temporarily

overshoots potential as inflation rises.
While the interest rate is zero, the money stock is constant
and nominal GDP grows (the growth in Y exceeds the fall in P).
The money/GDP ratio declines slowly.

In year 12, when the

interest rate becomes positive, the money/GDP ratio
falls by more than half.

This occurs through a large monetary

contraction: open-market purchases, Z, are -8% of GDP.

This

action is needed because of the high level of money at the start
of the simulation.

Although the money/GDP ratio falls in years

1-11, it remains far above the level that produces a positive
interest rate.

Thus a large money absorption is needed when the

Taylor rule takes effect.
The debt-income ratio rises initially, because the output
slump produces primary deficits.

The ratio peaks at 0.85 in year

5, then falls as the economy recovers.

It jumps up in year 12,

when the large monetary contraction occurs.

The BOJ’s sales of

government bonds raise the level of privately-held debt.
In steady state, the debt-income ratio falls slowly.

The

primary deficit is zero, and interest payments are balanced by
income growth, since r=g=2%.

The fall in the debt ratio results

from seignorage revenue, as Z>0 in steady state.

17

The ratio

reaches 0.77 in year 25.

V. A BOND-FINANCED FISCAL EXPANSION
This section examines how a bond-financed fiscal expansion
changes the evolution of the economy.
A. The Policy
In this experiment, interest-rate policy is the same as
before: i=max{iT,0}.

And once again, Z=0 when i=0.

However, this policy is now accompanied by fiscal transfers.
These transfers add to government debt through equation (6).
The transfers begin in year 1; given the lag in the IS curve,
they start affecting output in year 2.

The transfers are chosen

to end the slump quickly and permanently: the output gap is nonnegative in years 2, 3,....

Each period, the government makes

the smallest transfer sufficient to achieve this result.
To state this policy formally, let Gt* be the real transfer
that produces Yt+1=Yt+1*.
given the state at t.
(8)

Gt

=

Gt* can be computed from the IS curve

The rule for transfers is

max{Gt*, 0} , t≥1 .

If a positive transfer is needed to keep output at potential, it
is made.

If a negative transfer would keep output at potential,

no transfer is made.

In this case, output exceeds potential.

B. The Path of Transfers
Figure 5 shows the series of fiscal transfers implied by

18

equation (8).

In year 1, the transfer is 6.6% of output (Y), or

6.1% of potential output (Y*).

Given the multiplier of 1.25,

this transfer is needed to produce a zero output gap in period 2,
rather than the -7.6% gap of the baseline case.

The transfer is

2.2% of output in year 2, less than 1% in years 3 and 4, and zero
thereafter.

The necessary transfer peters out because r-r*

falls, stimulating spending.

(The real rate falls because π

rises, and r* rises by assumption.)

The cumulative transfer over

years 1-4 is 9.4% of output.
This fiscal expansion is large by historical standards, but
not gigantic.

Over the 1990s, Japan experienced a series of

changes in taxes and government spending (Kuttner and Posen,
2001).

Several of these shifts amounted to 2% of GDP or more; a

1998 stimulus package was 4%.

The total effect of fiscal policy

was small, because expansions in some years were offset by
contractions in others (such as the 1997 tax increase).

The key

difference between the transfers proposed here and recent
practice is that policy pushes consistently in one direction.
C. Effects of the Transfers
Figure 6 shows the effects of fiscal transfers.

It compares

the economy’s path under the transfer rule (8) (the dashed line)
to the baseline case without transfers (the solid line).

By

construction, the transfers return output to potential in period
2; most of the long slump in the baseline case is eliminated.

19

The faster recovery implies that inflation and the interest rate
start rising sooner than before.

Nonetheless, the Taylor rule

guides the economy to the same steady state, with 2% inflation.
The large transfer in period 1 causes the debt-income ratio
to jump up: it reaches 0.87, compared to 0.81 in the baseline
case.

After that the ratio falls rapidly as the transfers fuel

growth and inflation.

In year 2, the debt-income ratio with

transfers (0.825) is very close to the ratio in the baseline case
(0.824); in year 3, the ratio with transfers falls below the
baseline case.

It remains lower in all future years, except for

year 11 when it is slightly higher.

(The result for year 11

reflects the fact that the nominal interest rate rises earlier
with transfers.

The jump in debt from the necessary monetary

contraction occurs sooner.)
In steady state the debt-income ratio falls slowly in both
the baseline case and the case with transfers.
of the ratio is lower with transfers.

However, the path

In year 25, the ratio is

0.72 with transfers and 0.77 without them.

Thus the transfers

produce a win-win: they end the output slump quickly and they
improve the long-run fiscal situation.
To better understand these results, note that the cumulative
output gap in the baseline case is -44% of potential output.

The

cumulative gap with transfers is -5%, so the transfers raise
output by a total of 39% of potential.

20

The effect of output on

government revenue, θ, is 0.25; thus revenue rises by (0.25)39% =
9.8% of potential output.

This gain more than offsets the

initial transfers, which total 9.4% of potential.

The transfers

also reduce the debt-income ratio by raising inflation.
Inflation reaches zero in period 3, while it stays negative
through period 10 in the baseline case.

The faster rise in

inflation reduces real interest rates on the debt.

VI. A MONEY-FINANCED FISCAL EXPANSION
This section considers fiscal transfers financed by printing
money rather than issuing debt.

I ask whether money finance

produces lower debt-income ratios, as suggested by Bernanke and
others.
A. The Policy
In this experiment, the fiscal transfers are the same as
before (see the path in Figure 5).
in years 1 through 4.

There are positive transfers

The government finances the transfers by

issuing bonds and the central bank buys the bonds.

The central

bank’s purchases equal the nominal level of transfers:
(9)

Zt

=

P t Gt ,

t=1,...,4 .

These actions raise the money stock by the amount of the
transfers, and leave privately-held debt unchanged.

Thus they

are equivalent to a helicopter drop of money.
After year 4, monetary policy behaves as in the previous

21

experiments.

Open-market purchases are zero until the Taylor

rule prescribes a positive interest rate, and then this rule
determines policy.
B. Results
The fiscal multiplier does not depend on how transfers are
financed.

Thus switching from debt to money finance does not

change the path of output.

There is also no effect on inflation

or the interest rate, since the Phillips curve and Taylor rule
are unchanged.

The only changes are in open-market operations,

the money stock, and debt.
variables.

Figure 7 shows the paths of these

It compares the case of money-financed transfers (the

dotted lines) to the cases of bond-financed transfers and no
transfers.
When the transfers are money-financed, the money/income
ratio jumps up in year 1.

In contrast to the case of bond

finance, the debt-income ratio does not rise sharply.

In years 1

through 9, the money-income ratio is higher with money finance,
and the debt-income ratio is lower by the same amount.
Policymakers have substituted money for debt.
Things change in year 10, when the Taylor rule becomes
operative.

As before, contractionary open-market operations are

needed to reduce money to the level consistent with the Taylor
rule.

The necessary open-market sales are larger in the case of

money-financed transfers, because the money-income ratio is

22

higher in year 9.

The extra sales of debt raise the debt-income

ratio to its path in the bond-finance case.

In other words, the

monetization of debt in years 1-4 is reversed in year 10: money
is turned back into debt.

Starting in year 10, the initial

financing of transfers is irrelevant to all variables in the
model.
In light of these results, does it matter how transfers are
initially financed?

Monetization has no effect on output or

inflation, and no long-run effect on debt.

However, it prevents

the jump in the debt-income ratio that occurs in year 1 if
transfers are debt-financed.

With money finance, the debt-income

ratio never significantly exceeds its level in the baseline case.
Thus monetization matters if we care about the short-run path of
debt, not just its steady-state behavior.
Do we care about the short-run path of debt?

To address

this question, we must go beyond the model and ask why debt
matters.

A high debt-income ratio is dangerous because investors

may start to fear default, sparking a financial crisis (Ball and
Mankiw, 1995).

Higher debt at a point in time might increase

this danger, even holding constant the long-run behavior of debt.
Investors are more likely to panic when they hold more debt,
because they have more to lose from an immediate default.
However, the importance of this effect is unclear.

The case for

money-financed transfers is not as compelling as some economists

23

suggest.6
C. A Permanent Monetary Expansion
In the previous experiment, the increase in money that
finances transfers is reversed in the long run.

This fact

follows from the conventional assumption that the central bank
eventually follows a Taylor rule.

However, the reversal of the

monetary expansion differs from some economists’ suggestions.
Bernanke, for example, advocates money-financed transfers for
which “much or all of the increase in the money stock is viewed

6

Goodfriend (2001) and Suda (2001) argue that a monetary expansion to finance
transfers would eventually have to be reversed, with adverse fiscal consequences. Their
arguments anticipate the results of this section.
Auerbach and Obtsfeld (2004) present a model in which expansionary open-market
operations reduce debt permanently. This result contradicts my finding that monetization of debt
is irrelevant in the long run. The differences between Auerbach-Obstfeld’s results and mine
arise from different assumptions about inflation. In the Auerbach-Obstfeld model, a monetary
expansion causes inflation to rise, reducing real government debt, even when the interest rate is
zero. After that, inflation falls without a fall in output. In my model, monetary policy cannot
affect inflation at a zero interest rate, and a fall in inflation requires lower output and tax
revenue.

24

as permanent.”

Here I consider such a policy.

As one might

guess, the policy prevents the debt-income ratio from jumping up
at any point.

Unfortunately, it also produces hyperinflation.

Specifically, I assume again that transfers are governed by
equation (8), and that they are financed by money creation.
Monetary policy after the transfers is the same as in earlier
experiments, except for a constraint: open-market purchases must
be non-negative.
never fall.

That is, after the money stock rises, it can

This constraint first binds in year 11, when the

Taylor-rule interest rate becomes positive.

When the Taylor rule

implies Zt<0, the central bank sets Zt=0 instead.
Figure 8 shows the effects of this policy.

Through year 9

we see the same effects of money-financed transfers as before.
In year 10, the Taylor rule starts calling for large open-market
sales, but they do not occur.

Consequently, the money-income

ratio stays high and the nominal interest rate stays at zero.
The failure to tighten policy causes output and inflation to
rise.

At this point, the economy enters an unstable spiral:

higher inflation reduces the real rate, which raises output,
which further raises inflation.

Without reducing money, the

central bank cannot raise the interest rate to abort this
process.

Inflation reaches 7% in year 15 and 90% in year 25, and

keeps rising forever.7

7

Eventually inflation reduces the money-income ratio sufficiently that the nominal

transfers on the grounds that they would eventually produce high
inflation.
realized.

Figure 8 shows a scenario in which this fear is
We have seen that policymakers can prevent this

outcome by reducing the money stock when inflation starts rising.
But this action reverses the fiscal gain that money finance is
intended to achieve.

VII. ROBUSTNESS
This section considers the robustness of my results.

I

first vary the model’s parameters, and then consider broader
changes in assumptions.
The paper’s main conclusions are fairly robust.
expansion always produces a faster output recovery.

A fiscal
The long-run

effects on the debt-income ratio vary across specifications.

In

most cases, however, a fiscal expansion reduces debt below its
level under passive policy.

In some cases, this gain is large.

At worst, a fiscal expansion raises long-run debt by a small
amount.
A. The Neutral Real Rate
As discussed in Section III, Japan’s neutral real interest

interest rate starts rising. However, it rises more slowly than inflation, so the real rate falls
forever.

26

rate appears to be negative, but is unlikely to stay negative
forever.

So far, I have assumed the neutral rate r* starts at -

2% and rises linearly to +2% over ten years.

Here I continue to

assume r* rises linearly from -2% to +2%, but vary the speed of
this rise.

A fast increase in r* means the IS curve shifts out

quickly.
A faster increase in r* weakens the case for fiscal
expansion.

This is illustrated by Figure 9.

Like Figure 6, this

Figure compares the economy’s evolution with passive policy and
with the fiscal rule (8).

But it assumes that r* rises to +2% in

five years rather than ten.

Fiscal expansion still raises

output, but its effects on debt are a bit less favorable than
before.

The debt-income ratio in year 25 is about one percentage

point higher with the expansion than without.
This result reflects the effects of the r* path on output.
If r* rises more quickly, then output recovers more quickly in
the case of passive policy.

This reduces the benefits of ending

the initial slump with a fiscal expansion.

There are smaller

output gains, and hence smaller revenue gains to offset the
initial cost of the expansion.
Figure 10 considers a range of paths for r*.

I assume this

parameter rises linearly from -2% to +2% in n years, and vary n
from 1 to 20.

For each n, the Figure shows the debt-income ratio

in year 25 with passive policy and with a fiscal expansion.

27

The

expansion raises the debt-income ratio for n<6, but only by
modest amounts.

The costs of expansion when n is small are lower

than the gains when n is large.
B. Equation Coefficients
Table 3 examines robustness to varying the coefficients in
the model’s equations -- the IS and Phillips curves and the debt
equation.

Starting from the base values in Table 2, I change one

coefficient at a time, trying values that are twice as large and
half as large.

For each variation, Table 3 reports the debt-

income ratio in year 25 with passive policy and with a fiscal
expansion.8
Not surprisingly, a key coefficient is δ, the fiscal
multiplier.

A larger multiplier means a smaller transfer is

needed to return output to potential.

This reduces the debt-

income ratio in the case of expansionary policy.

Recall that the

base value of δ is 1.25; for this value, the debt-income ratio in
year 25 is 5 points lower with expansionary policy than with
passive policy.

This gain rises to 9 points for δ=2.5, but it

falls to -3 points for δ=0.625.

The gain is positive for all

8

As I vary the model coefficients, I also vary the coefficients in the central bank’s
interest-rate rule, equation (7). As discussed in Section IV, the coefficients in (7) are chosen so
that inflation moves halfway to its target each period. The coefficients defined by this rule are
functions of the IS and Phillips-curve coefficients.

28

δ>0.76.
When the other coefficients change, the fiscal gains from
transfers are robust.

Transfers raise the long-run debt ratio in

only one case (λ=0.3), and then by a trivial amount.

Often

transfers reduce debt by large amounts (e.g. 41% of GDP for
α=0.4).
C. Perpetual Deficits
So far I have assumed the government’s primary budget is
balanced if output is at potential and the transfers G are zero.
This assumption does not fit Japan today.

There is a large

primary deficit, which is only partly cyclical.

It appears this

deficit would be about 5% of GDP if output were at potential.
This fact can be captured by adding a term to the debt
equation, (6).
(9)

Dt

=

The equation becomes
Dt-1 + it-1Dt-1 + PtGt - Zt - θ(PtYt - PtY*t)
+ (0.05)PtY*t .

The last term is the primary deficit when output is at potential.
This modification does not change the behavior of output or
inflation, but it does affect the debt path.

For base parameter

values, Figure 11 shows this path for the cases of passive and
expansionary fiscal policy.
rises forever.

In both cases the debt-income ratio

A permanent budget deficit leads to disaster.

However, fiscal expansion still compares favorably to
passive policy.

Starting in year 2, the debt-income ratio is
29

always smaller with the expansion.

This policy does not

eliminate the underlying deficit problem, but it slows the growth
of debt.
D. A Textbook Phillips Curve
The main model assumes that expected inflation cannot fall
below zero.

Here I assume that expected inflation equals past

inflation, even if past inflation is negative:
(10)

πte

=

πt-1 .

This assumption and equation (2) produce an accelerationist
Phillips curve:
(11)

πt

=

πt-1 + α(Yt-1-Y*t-1)/Y*t-1 .

Figure 12 shows how this modification affects the economy under
alternative policies.
The largest changes occur for the case of no fiscal
expansion -- the solid line in the Figure.

In this case, the

output slump leads to a deflationary spiral.

Low output reduces

inflation, which raises the real interest rate, which further
reduces output.

Inflation and output head to minus infinity.

With an accelerationist Phillips curve, passive policy is
disastrous.
The dashed line in the Figure shows the effects of the
fiscal rule (8).

The outcomes from this policy are better than

from passive policy, but still not good.
and then remains at that level.

liquidity trap.

The economy stays in a

To keep output at potential, as required by rule

(8), the government must provide transfers forever.

This causes

the debt-income ratio to rise without bound.
In this version of the model, a more aggressive fiscal
expansion is better.

The dotted line in Figure 12 shows what

happens if the transfer in year 1 is 15% of potential output,
rather than 7% as dictated by (8).

This transfer creates a boom

in year 2, pushing inflation from -4% to -2% in year 3.

With 2%

inflation, the real interest rate is low enough for the economy
to escape the liquidity trap.

Eventually a non-negative output

gap can be sustained without transfers.

The debt-income ratio

peaks at 0.91 in year 26 and then falls.

expectations of future variables.

Here I introduce some forward-

I define the real interest rate as the nominal

rate minus expected future inflation, not current inflation.
Since the model is non-stochastic, expected inflation equals
actual future inflation.

This variation has only minor effects on the results.

Once

again, a fiscal expansion ends the output slump and reduces longrun debt.

expansion and 0.79 with passive policy.

VIII. CONCLUSION
This paper examines the effects of fiscal transfers in a
model of the Japanese economy.

Initial conditions are set to

capture Japan’s slump as of 2003.

I determine the level of

transfers needed to return output to potential, and the effects
on inflation and the debt-income ratio.

I assume that monetary

policy follows a Taylor rule once the interest rate becomes
positive.
A quick output recovery requires transfers totaling 9.4% of
potential GDP over four years.

After the recovery, the Taylor

rule guides the economy to a steady state with output at
potential and 2% inflation.

If the transfers are financed with

bonds, they cause the debt-income ratio to jump up.

After that,

the ratio falls rapidly due to higher growth, inflation, and tax
revenue.

In steady state, the debt-income ratio is lower than in

a baseline case with no transfers.

Thus the transfers produce a

win-win: they end the output slump and reduce Japan’s long-run
fiscal problem.
I also consider transfers financed with money rather than
debt.

The finance method does not influence the paths of output

or inflation.

It also does not affect the debt-income ratio in

steady state, because the initial monetization of debt is

32

eventually reversed.

However, money finance prevents the initial

run-up of debt that occurs with bond-financed transfers.

Thus

money finance is preferable if policymakers care about short-run
as well as long-run debt levels.
The results in this paper capture the ideas of some Japanwatchers.

For example, in discussing the downgrade of Japan’s

debt, Thomas Byrne of Moody’s argues that Japan needs a fiscal
expansion:
Japan can’t consolidate its way out of this (debt problem),
it has to grow its way out. Any policy that ends deflation
and stimulates growth (is good). A fiscal policy that
didn’t include a lot of wasteful spending may present nearterm anxiety but, if it really did stimulate growth, it
would be good over the long term. [quoted in Pilling (2002)]
Byrne suggests that the long-run fiscal benefits from
expansionary policy would outweigh the costs, as this paper
finds.

The “near-term anxiety” he mentions is presumably caused

by the temporary rise in debt from a bond-financed expansion.
Thus Byrne also provides a rationale for money finance, which
reduces debt in the short run.
