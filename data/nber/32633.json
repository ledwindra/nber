    "abstract": "\n\nIn a model of memory and selective recall, household inflation expectations remain rigid when inflation is anchored but exhibit sharp instability during inflation surges, as similarity prompts retrieval of forgotten high-inflation experiences. Using data from the New York Fed\u2019s Survey of Consumer Expectations and the University of Michigan\u2019s Consumer Survey, we show that similarity can quantitatively account for the sharp post-pandemic rise in inflation expectations, particularly among the elderly. The memory-based model also accounts for how people estimate future inflation ranges and why they neglect infrequent experiences when forming point expectations. These predictions are likewise supported by the data.\n\n",
