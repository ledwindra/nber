It is based on the premise that the field has evolved through the efforts of two types of macroeconomist\u2014 those who understand the field as a type of engineering and those who would like it to be more of a science.  While the early macroeconomists were engineers trying to solve practical problems, macroeconomists have more recently focused on developing analytic tools and establishing theoretical principles.  These tools and principles,  however, have been slow to find their way into applications.  As the field of macroeconomics has evolved, one recurrent theme is the interaction\u2014sometimes productive and sometimes not\u2014 between the scientists and the engineers.\n\n",
