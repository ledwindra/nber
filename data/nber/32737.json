    "abstract": "\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminated federal charitable giving incentives for roughly 20 percent of US income-tax payers. We study the impact of this on giving. Basic theory and our empirical results suggest heterogeneous effects for taxpayers with different amounts of itemizable expenses. Overall, the reform decreased charitable giving by about $20 billion annually. Using a new method to adjust estimates for retimed giving, we find evidence of moderate intertemporal shifts from pre-announcement of the law. The permanent price elasticity of giving estimates range from .6 for the average donor to over 2 for those predicted to be most responsive to the reform.\n\n",
