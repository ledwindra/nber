    "abstract": "\n\nA wide range of interventions, from subsidized grains all the way to conditions on nutrition in conditional cash transfers, have either been tried or put in place in different countries in order to fight under-nutrition. A number of important policy experiments in recent years, directly or indirectly, offer important insights into how best to design these interventions. This essay is an attempt to pull together some of those insights, with the aim of saying something about what the optimal design should look like.\n\n",
