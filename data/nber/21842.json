    "abstract": "\n\nWe discuss a method aimed at reducing the risk that spurious results are published. Researchers send their datasets to an independent third party who randomly generates training and testing samples. Researchers perform their analysis on the former and once the paper is accepted for publication the method is applied to the latter and it is those results that are published. Simulations indicate that, under empirically relevant settings, the proposed method significantly reduces type I error and delivers adequate power. The method \u2013 that can be combined with pre-analysis plans \u2013 reduces the risk that relevant hypotheses are left untested.\n\n",
