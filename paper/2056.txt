The Demand for Workers and Hours and the Effects of Job Security Policies:
Theory and Evidence

ABSTRACT

There has been a wide variety of research on worker—hours
the effects of various costs on the speed and

substi tution arid

extent to which labor demand adjusts. Much of this 1iterature
t.hough confuses various types of fixed costs and fails to provide a
guide for identifying how chanQes in labor—cost structures affect

static relative demands for workers and hours and the paths by which
they adjust. This study presents a typology o-f labor cost
structures and examines how they affect these and other aspects of
labor demand. Some of the many recently adopted changeE. in 1 abormarket policies in OECD countries are pigeonhol ed by their effects
on labor cc'sts.

slight

A

review cf the cvi dence indicates clearly that there is some
substitution between workers and hours along a constant

effecti ye—i abor I soquarit..

The evidence is clear that erripl oyers

adjust the demand for hours more rapidly than that for workers and
that both adjust fairly rapidly. It also shows that a major effect
of cost-increasing policies designed to induce substitution from
hours to workers is a reduction in the total amount of worker—hours

demanded. Original analysis demonstrates that lags in the adjustment
of employment in response to chanctes in demand lengthened in most
OECD countries during the 1970s.

ignore the effects of di 'Fferences in
1

averane labor costs among groups of workers, as I have analyzed
and summarized evidence on them elsewhere (Hamermesh, 1986).

A. Fixed E.ploym.nt Costs
The simplest example of a labor—cost structure is a fixed cost
per worker, V, that the employer must pay each time period no matter
how many hours a particular worker's services are utilized or how

much the worker's hourly labor cost is. Examples of such costs
include employer—provided health insurance (life insurance too in
some cases); clerical costs of maintaining payroll and other records
on the worker; and, in the United States, the (relatively low level

of) taxes that finance unemployment insurance benefits.a
Following Rosen (1978), assume that the total cost of labor
is W(H)EH+VE, where W is the hourly wage rate, expressed as a
function of hours per worker, and H is the average hours worked per

employee. Then the marginal cost of a worker is WH+V; the cost of
an extra hour of labor is approximately EWCI+p], where E is total

employment, and p is the elasticity of the wage rate with respect

to hours. Under certain simplifying assumptions p is the premium
rate for overtime work.

(I assume overtime is worked, but that it

constitutes a small fraction of total hours.) Assume that
production is characterized by.

Cl) Q = FCK, G(E,H)),
where K is the typical firm's capital input.

I assume here that

employment—hours substitution is separable from capital—labor

substitution, which may or may not be correct.3
Consider the effect of an increase in V if 14 remains constant.

Labor costs per worker rise, so that the cost of a given number of

and a constant premium for overtime work, increased fixed costs of

The third effect is more subtle and arises from the

heterogeneity of labor inputs. Assume for analytical simplicity
that there are only two types of labor, working H1 and H hours
respectively, and that the firm uses E1 and E employees in each

category. Total labor costs are then

capital) Moreover, within each group of workers there will be

on earnings, and increases in the ceiling at a constant tax

rate, raise the cost of employment if the ceiling is low, and have
no effect on the cost of an addi t i onal hour

They are both

equivalent to increases in fixed employment costs If the ceiling
is higher the effect of these changes on the relative size of fixed

and variable employment costs may differ
Reductions in the standard workweek (that require penalty
rates on hours beyond the normal week) raise the fixed cost of
employment,

since

the cost of an additional worker is raised by the

penalty times the reduction in the

normal workweek; but the cost of

an additional. hour also increases for employees who had been
working marginally less than the previous standard weeks The net
impact depends on the

distribution

of hours per worker before the

change was imposed Changes in the penalty rate for overtime pay,
and restri ctions on the amount cf overtime that may be used, are

other examples. In each case the impacts of the pure policy on
labor—labor and employment—hours substitution will be attenuated
because the marginal cost of an additional hour is raised; but, to
the extent that the fixed—cost component of the change dominates,

the ratio of employment to hours and the mix of workers employed

will change in the directions indicated above. However, the
potentially ambiguous effect of mixed policies underscores the
importance of analyzing the specifics of each proposed change.

B. Costs of changing Employment
A variety of natural and imposed labor costs accompanies gross

changes in a firm's employment. Costs of searching for and
processing new employees, including advertising costs and part of
the overhead costs of maintaining a personnel department; initial

training costs (those that must be incurred to make the employee
minimally productive in the firm), to the extent the employer shares
in these costs; and payroll costs that accompany layoffs, including
higher payroll taxes or direct payments, are some examples.

Most of the analysis of the cost of adjusting employment has
assumed that the average cost increases the larger is the change in

employment. The assumption is embodied in Figure 1A in the positive
slope of CK.' That average costs are increasing is usually
rationalized by pointing to an ever—greater disruption of the firm's

operations as the change in employment increases. Consider a
standard downward—sloping labor—demand schedule, D1 (shown in Figure
18), with the firm confronted by an imposed increase in the hourly

cost of labor, from W0 to W2. We deal here with a decrease in
equilibrium employment; a rise in employment can be handled mutatis

and 3) The greater the firms elasticity of demand for labor.

I-f

adjustment costs differ among workers, the firm will also substitute
labor of one type for that of another. If, for example, the average
cost over an entire business cycle of employing older workers rises
due to an increase in the cost of laying them off5 their employment
will fall relative to that of younger workers (unless their supply
is perfectly inelastic and relative wages are flexible).
In the standard anal ysi s exposi ted above, asymmetries between

hiring and discharge costs were ignored, so that increases and
decreases in employment were treated identically.'7 It should be
clear from the list of the sources of adjustment costs that there is
9

no reason to expect the cost of a hire to be the same as that of a
discharcie. The total costs of the change or the variation a-f
averacie cost. with the size a-f the chanQe need not be the same for
hires and discharges. The costs of searching for and processing new
workers are entirely different from layoff costs. This distinction
sugQests

that the

elasticity of employment with respect to a

particular demand shock and the length of the lag in the response to
that

shock will vary

with its direction.

C. Indirect and Potential Costs of Adjustment
A

third variety of

-

nonwage casts that affect firms' behavior

from wages and fringes are costs imposed by regulation
of the apcess of adjusting employment. In some senses these are
similar to the costs discussed above. I distinguish them here
differently

because they relate to less aggregated problems of adiustment such
as who may be laid off,1 what information must be provided to
employeesq etc. Consider
workers

first regulations on the order in which

are laid off. Included in such

collectively--bargained

regulations are

requirements that layoffs be made according

to inverse seniorityq and legal restrictions on layoffs of more
senior workers. These regulations will not impose any cost on the
firm i-f the wacie paid to each worker exactly reflects his/her
productivity. in that case the firm can abide by the regulatic'ris at
no cost for it would be mdi +-ferent about the order of layoffs in
their absence.
The more likely case is that wages increase with tenure:
(3)

W = F(TN),

F

:>

0,

F'

where W is the wage rate and TN i s

0,

the worker' s seniity. The
10

positive relationship may be due to shared investment in firm—
specific training (Becker, 1964) or be part of some long—term
implicit contract between the worker and the firm (Lazear, 1951).
Assume also that productivity rises with tenure:
(4)

ii =

S(TN), 6' > 0,

where n is the worker's productivity per period, and that F—6

increases monotonically with TN. We assume more senior workers earn
a wage above their current productivity as part of some optimal

long—term implicit contract, perhaps because this wage—productivity
relationship induces higher lifetime output by workers.

Alternatively, the excess of wages over productivity among more
senior workers might be "explained" by custom.
Assuming now that there are no other costs of layoff or of

hiring, how will the employer behave in the presence of fluctuations

in product demand? The regulation of layoffs by inverse seniority
obviously imposes an adjustment cost on the firm. However, the
average cost is decreasing with the size of the adjustment: A
small adjustment requires that the least senior worker-, whose

productivity exceeds the wage by the greatest amount, be laid off.

That first layoff is quite costly. As more layoffs are made in a
particular time period, the cost per layoff declines, as more senior
workers, for whom W—u is greater, become subject to layoff. With a
declining average cost of adjustment, it pays the firm to
concentrate in one period all the layoffs it intends to make in

response to expected changes in product demand. As in Section B
above, though, the imposition of adjustment costs makes the employer
less likely to change employment in response to a particular shift
11

-in product demand, and reduces the size of adjustments that do

occur. These costs also represent an increase in total cost per
worker, leading firms to reduce average employment over the cycle.
If wages do not equal productivity, the imposition of this

regulation will lead to changes in relative employment by seniority.
In the short run the work force will clearly become more senior; but
with the regulation the cost of employing more senior workers rises
relative to that of more junior workers, especially in those firms

whose product demand is more variable. This change in relative
costs leads employers to undertake policies, such as a flattening of
the wage—tenure profile, that eventually change the quit—tenure
relationship and raise the ratio of junior to senior employees.

Even if no layoffs ever occur, the possibility of layoffs being
conducted under inverse seniority, coupled with the systematic
departure of wage rates from productivity, induces employers to seek
a less senior work force.

This point applies equally well to other restrictions on

layoffs that differ by seniority. If restrictions are imposed on
laying off more senior workers, employers will seek to substitute
junior for senior workers by changing wage structures to alter the

quit—tenure relationship. Conversely, if junior workers are
protected, employers will try to steepen wage—tenure profiles and

induce senior workers to remain on the job longer. Any restriction
on severing members of a particular group of employees will lead
employers to hire other groups of workers in preference to them.'
A second potential cost of adjustment is the requirement that
information about planned changes in labor demand be made public.

them to change any decisions that affect the extent to which they
are tied to their current employers. Investment in firm—
specific training will be reduced so that the stock of firm—specific
human capital will be smaller than otherwise at the time the layoff

occurs (Hamermeshq 1987). The rcduced investment will increase
workers' likelihood a-f quitting for the discrepancy between their
current wage and their alternative wages elsewhere will be reduced.

Ta the extent that workers do not anticipate layoffs or plant

closings well requirements of openness about them

induce a

more rapid reallocation of labor to expanding industries. However,

those workers with the greatest past investment in training specific
to the firm (and to the industry, if the entire industry is
endangered) may act on the information by seeking governmental

protection for their employers; with greater specific investment
public requirements of notification are more likely to lead to
increased voice rather than more rapid exit.

wages in that sector can fall to absorb the increased supply. The
policy of partial coverage thus leads to a reduction in the size of

•the covered sector and an expansion in the uncovered sector. This
kind of two—tier policy gives employers a continuing incentive to
substitute unprotected for protected workers and to contract
services out to firms in the unprotected sector.
Partial coverage also affects the propensity of covered

workers to quit their protected Jobs. Since these jobs must be
rationed (because of the supply of uncovered workers seeking them),

incumbents are less likely to quit, for the alternative is a lower—

payingj insecure job in the uncovered sector. Obversely, those in
the uncovered sector have an increased probability of quitting, for
the lower wage rates there combine with the attraction of protected

jobs to induce more turnover. The economy—wide impact on turnover
of job—security policies involving partial coverage is unclear.

Analysis of Job Security Provisions

In this section 1 pigeonhole a variety of policies that have

been undertaken to promote job security. While the set examined is
by no means exhaustive, it is sufficiently representative to provide
indications of how other policies might be categorized in light of
the theoretical discussion.

I discuss the policies in the order in

which the various types of costs were considered in Section II.
A.

Policies Affecting Fixed Costs
In the United Kingdom and the

FRG a number of industries have

collectively negotiated a ouaranteed oeriodic oavment (Gennard,

1979, pp. 43, 51). Such a policy converts an hourly, variable cost
into a fixed cost exactly like those we discussed in Section II.A.

Shorter workweeks have been introduced in several countries
recently Thus France chaned the standard workweek to 39 hours in
1982. The c-f fect of such chariQcs is uncl ear it depends as we saw
in Section II.A., on the distribution c-f current employees by the
amount c-f hours worked per week. Many governments offer subsidies

to short-ti me work as in Japan where only reductions of entire
days are subsi di zed or in the FRG France anc:t ltd y where
reductions in hours generally are encouraged (Gennard 1985) Suc:h
policies lower the pricE:' cf workers relative to hours and provide an
incentive to substi tute addi t I onal workers -for 1 anger workweeks.

The United Kingdom's Temporary Employment Subsidy provided

employees who would otherwise have been discharged (Gennard 19795
p. 31); Sweden offers training subsidies linked to workers' wage

rates to employers who forego layoffs (McKersie—Senenbergerq 1983)

These policies bsidize retention of workers and thus implicitly
raise the relative cost of adjustment As such, firms are less
likely to vary employment over the cycle. However because

employment fluctuations is, as I showed in Section II, unclear *

priori. Assume, however, that they impose costs on the employer
because they impose a different ordering from the (private) cost—

minimizing ordering that the employer would choose. If so, they
induce all the short— and long—run effects on employment, wage

structures and mobility that were discussed in Section II.C. Most
important in terms of aggregate employment, they reduce cyclical
fluctuations, and also reduce average levels of employment.
Limits or bans on hiring have been introduced through

collective negotiations in the Berman steel industry and elsewhere

(Bennard, 1979, pp. 63, 72). Assuming that employers would hire
workers into some jobs while discharging them from others, such a

ban represents an additional adjustment cost. It will reduce
employment fluctuations while raising labor costs, thus reducing the
average amount of labor demanded.

Prenotification of impending plant closings or major layoffs
must be provided to governments and/or employee representatives in a

number of OECD countries. In the United Kingdom, Italy and the FRG
prenotification must be given to certain workers even in cases of

impending individual dismissals. All such requirements operate as
indicated in Section lIt They affect the speed with which
adjustments take place, the willingness of firms to invest in new
capital equipment and of workers and firms to invest in training,
and the mobility patterns of workers in the affected firms.

D. The Partial Coverage of Jab—Security Legislation
A

wide variety of restrictions in the various provisions of

job—security legislation make that legislation conform to the model
19

of partial coverage that was outlined in Section II.D. For
example:

1) Canada is considering requiring that part—time

employees (those working more than 20 hours per week) be covered by
pensions (effectively decreasing problems that arise from partial

coverage of protective legislation);'° 2) Exemptions from job—
security legislation exist for workers and firms that do not meet

various criteria (Gennard, 1985). Thus in the United Kingdom claims
of unfair dismissal are not allowed for employees with less than two

years of seniority. The seniority requirement is even more
stringent for part—time employees. In Italy some of the legislation
excludes employers of fewer

than 35 workers, while in the FRG

employers of fewer than 5 workers are excluded from employment
protection legislation generally; 3) In Germany and Italy
prenotification requirements are much more stringent for white— than
for blue—collar workers.

To the

extent that employers can

substitute part— for full—

time workers exemptions will result in an expansion of the part—time.

work force. Similarly, they should favor the relative expansion of
smaller enterprises, especially in those sectors in which economies
of

scale do not exist or are not very substantial. Indeed, to the

extent

that substitution by employers and consumers is possible,

job—security legislation may have
created the beginning of two—tier societies, one with rigid job—
exemptions from the panoply of

security

requirements covering high—paid, senior, full—time workers

in large firms, the other more flexible, with part—time, low—paid,

workers in small businesses. The high—paid tier will
contract because of the imposed rigidity, while the low—paid tier
insecure

will expand.

Several studies of the demand + or overtime hours have attempted

to divide employment costs into fixed and variable components.

Their choice of data allows for much greater variability in the
underlying marginal costs of employment and hours, and thus at least
makes it possible to measure the extent of substitution of

employment for hours. The three analyses for the U.S. summarized in
Ehrenberg—Schumann (1982) and that study itself all suggest that
higher fixed costs of employment do reduce the long—run employment—
hours ratio. ln all these studies, though, the trade—of fs are quite

smalls A one—third increase in the relative cost of an hour of
overtime would produce no more than a 4 percent decline in the ratio

of overtime to other hours. A somewhat larger effect is produced
for West Germany using time—series data, 1964—1983, by Iconig—

Pohlmeier (1996;.
Using annual data, 1951—1981, for West Germany, Hart—Kawasaki
(1986) decompose payments to labor, particularly payroll taxes, into

fixed and variable measures and examine their effects on employment

and hours. Their model treats hours, employment and the capital
stock as jointly determined by their lagged values, fixed and
variable payroll taxes, output, nonwage fixed and variable labor

costs, and capital costs. The authors find surprisingly that a cut
in the payroll—tax ceiling in a tax structure with a high ceiling

relative to the average wage level increases employment and reduces

hours per worker. They attribute this perverse result to their use
of a model that includes both capital and labor. Hart—Kawasaki
(1986) also produce the expected finding that decreased variable
payroll taxes reduce the employment/hours ratio.

23

While the evidence seems fairly clear that an increase in the
fixed costs of employment induces only slight substitution away from
workers and toward hours, holding total worker—hours constant, that
does not mean the negative employment effects of job—security

policies that impose fixed employment costs are small. Elsewhere
(Hamermesh, 1986) I have summarized an immense body of evidence on

the elasticity of labor demand with respect to labor costs. The
overwhelming bulk of studies that use modern estimation techniques
finds that the net (including all adjustments among firms) long—run
constant—output labor—demand elasticity characterizing broad

aggregates of industries is between .1 and .5. The total

elasticity, which allows for scale effects, is larger still. That
being the case, policies that increase the fixed costs of employment
may reduce the employment—hours ratio only slightly, but can effect
substantial reductions in the total amount of worker—hours employed.
B.

Adjustment Casts and Lagged Labor Demand
There is a huge mass of empirical evidence demonstrating that

the demand for workers and hours lags behind output. Moreover, the
lags in the adjustment of employment are greater than those in the

adjustment of hours per worker. Hamermesh (1976) summarizes a large
number of early studies demonstrating this fact. More recent
evidence corroborates this conclusion in more carefully specified

models. Using a model like that of Nadiri—Rosen (1969), but
decomposing changes in product demand into expected and unexpected

components, Topel (1982) suggests a similar conclusion based on data

for

1958—1975 for six U.S. manufacturing industries. For the

automobile industry Chang (1983) demonstrates this both for the
24

United States and for the state of Michigan..
The averane length of the lags of employment and hours behind
output changes is not so closely determined as are their rd at i ye
1 encths. However the cvi dence sumrnar I ed I n Hamermesh (1976)
suiests that. near-i y all the adjustment is compi eted i thin one

Recent studies of the FRG

and

Franc:e (Bucher, 1984) using

than that of employment declines. What this finding implies

about potential asymmetries in the effects of job—security policies
is unclear without a specification of how those policies affect
adjustment c:osts.

The short-run effects of specific policies have received very

little serious empirical attention. Nickell (1979) examined British

manufacturing data 195—1976 and found that the lag in employment
rose during this periods while the lag in hours declined. He
attributed these changes to the increased requirements of job—

security policies. More recently Nickell (1982) showed that between
1967 and 1977 an i rjc:rease

in the use

of unfaa r dismissal legislation

caused a reduction in both hiring and flows from employment with
the

dominating (so that the net effect was a reducti on in

At. the same time though, we know that. large

labor. These changes may also have altered the lag structure in
empi oyment---output and hours—output rd ati ors (though there is no a

pri reason to believe this happened). All we can test,
therefore, is whether or not changes in lag structures occurred.
For each country with available data an integrated vector—
autoregression model was estimated for the manufacturing sector:
(3)

= aY— + EbQ- ct +

where a, b and c are parameters; V is the dependent variable (in

logarithms) Q is the logarithm of output; t is a time trend and E
is a di sturbance term. The dependent variable V is either
emp]. oyment or total hours worked. For all couritri es the 'earl yU
time period ended in 1973 III and the lat.e' time period began with
1973:IV. This break point is. chosen to coincide with the first oil
shock. Obviously the timing of the impacts of job—security policies
differs in different c:ountries, and it would he more appropriate to
z.. p

search for structural changes in each country separately. Failing
that, we follow standard practice and use the oil shock to demarcate

the point at which the structure may have changed. For most
countries the initial observation in the early period is 1961:1, and

the final observation in the late time period is 19851j1ta

The results of estimating equation (5) are shown in Table 1.
In addition to the usual coefficients and t—statistics, the table

also shows: The chi—square statistic on the likelihood—ratio test
for including the vector of four terms in

i0,...,3; Durbin's

(1970) h—statistic, distributed n(0,1)p and the estimated average

lag of adjustment of the dependent variable to an output shock. For
the six large countries the estimates are fairly satisfactory,
though there is some tendency for the h—statistic to reject the null
hypothesis of no serial correlation in the employment equations.

The average lag of employment adjustment in the six large countries
exceeds that of hours adjustment in eleven out

of

the twelve pairs

of equations estimated. Among the six smaller countries the
estimates are either less precise (Greece and Finland) or imply lags
of ridiculous length (Ireland).

Recognizing that the application of a common specification to
data from a large number of economies will produce some anomalies,

it is still worthwhile examining common trends in the results. The
numbers without parentheses in Table 2 (from which Ireland is
excluded because the estimated lags made no sense) are totals
including only the six large countries, while those in parentheses

include all eleven countries. Considering only the employment—
output equations (the last line of the table), there is a tendency

samples of fairly junior workers (Bishop—Stephenson, 1982, and
Brown, 1983) suggests that productivity increases with seniority at
least over the initial years of an employment relation; and evidence
on a sample that allows a direct measure of productivity (Maranto—
Rodgers, 1984) indicates that seniority and productivity are

positively related. The best conclusion at this point is that there
is a positive relation between seniority and productivity, but that
it may not be so strong as the wage—seniority relation.

There is remarkably little evidence on the employment effects
of specific policies that attempt to prevent layoffs by changing

indirect costs. Metcalf (1984) used cross—section British data on
industries to show that the Temporary Employment Subsidy succeeded

in reducing permanent layoffs. (His results also showed

that

short—

time compensation increased layoffs, a result that is hard to
credit.)

As we saw in Section IV.B., Nickell (1982) demonstrated a

similar effect of unfair dismissal legislation in the U.K. The
difficulties with broad—brush empirical work that uses gross
measures in aggregate time—series equations to estimate the effects

of complex policies are by now well known. It seems clear that
serious evaluation of policies that affect indirect costs will
require both more detailed specification of the programs' parameters

use of more disaggregated data. At this point we simply have
very little information on the employment effects of anti—layoff
and

programs that operate by affecting costs indirectly.
If markets worked

well,

in the sense that information was

good, there would be little need for many of the programs

restricting employers' rights to lay off workers. For example, if

Indeed, cvi dence for a particular

workers

(Addison—F'ortuqal. 1986) indicates that prenotification does

reduce the costs of dislocation.

They do, however, a-f-f act

the magni tucle c::+ adjustments I n ampi oyment in respc:nsE' to changes in

product demand. When average labor costs are changed by job—
security policies, average levels of employment demand will change
through the standard routes of capital—labor substitution and scale

effects. Not all job—security policies impose costs that reduce
total labor demands To the extent that policies provide information
that functions as a public good (such as prenotification of
impending layoffs), they may increase labor—market efficiency.

However, the role of job—security policies in reducing total worker—

hours, should not be ignored: Studies that are relevant to
assessing the impact of job—security policies on the mix of

employment and hours are not conclusive, but those that allow us
infer their effects on total worker—hours are.

The discussion in Section IV makes it apparent how little we
know about how job—security programs in general affect labor costs,

and what the impacts of particular policies have been. The few
studies of job—security policies that were enacted in the
industrialized countries during the 1970s and early 1980s do suggest
they achieved their aims, but at the expense of reducing total

worker—hours in protected employment. Better evidence is provided
by studies of the impact of labor costs more generally: These
suggest that the policies could have produced some short—run

increase in employment. Given the lengths of lags in adjustment,
though, the evidence indicates that it is unlikely they induced a
substitution of employment for hours that lasted beyond several

years. Moreover, to the extent that they raised labor costs, as
most did, they contributed to a decline in total worker—hours
through the elasticity of demand for labor services.

33

The discussion of

the

theory of labor costs and the evidence

on it imply that job—security policies can induce a temporary
substitution of employment for hours, and can permanently mitigate
short—run employment fluctuations ———

both decreases and increases

in employment. They accomplish this at the cost of reducing the
equilibrium level of labor input and of output. They thus offer an
industrialized economy a choice between greater employment stability
(with fewer total hours worked on average) and greater employment

fluctuations Cwith more total hours worked on average). Moreover,
to the extent they cover only part of the labor market, they help
create a two-tier labor market consisting of secure Jobs in a
declining sector and insecure Jobs in an expanding sector.

per unit of labor services, r is the firm's

discount rate, C(L) is the adjustment cost, and I have assumed labor is the

only input in a production function F, with F' > 0, F'' < 0. Assume that the
marginal cost of adjustment can be increasing and in particular that. C is
quadratic:

C(L) =

If b > 0, the steady state is described by L = L = 0 and L* such that:

(This is the standard marginal—productivity condition for labor demand, with

and that w increases. The new equilibrium is shown as L* in Figure

to L is
(3), F'(L) decreases, as must L. The adjustment path from
indicated by the arrow. A similar analysis applies if the firm begins
at L1, and is then shocked at t = 0 by a wage decrease.

If b = 0, the marginal cost of adjustment is constant in L, and (4) holds
for all t.

Thus any change in w causes the firm to adjust instantaneously to

the new L* that satisfies (4). That this is true when b = 0, but adjustment
is slow when b > 0, shows that a more rapid increase in the marginal cost

as L increases reduces the rate of adjustment. A higher marginal cost of
adjustment--a--reduces L*, as does a higher discount rate. Employment on
average is lower where adjustment costs are greater.

That greater adjustment costs reduce employment fluctuations when shocks
occur can be seen by assuming the firm is in equilibrium at t =

0, given w0,

and that w changes temporarily to w1 for some known period of time, T. The
maximand (1) becomes:

Since the firm's adjustment is slower when b is greater, the shock to w will
result in a smaller movement away from L0 by t = T than if b were smaller. If

b = 0 the firm will choose either to maintain L =
to L1 at t =

0, then jump back to L0 at t = T.

L0

for all t, or to jump

With constant marginal

adjustment costs the fluctuation will be the same size if it occurs; but the
employer's willingness to vary L at all decreases as a is larger.
