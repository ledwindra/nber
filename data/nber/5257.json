We estimate both cross sectional and fixed effects models using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.  Several of our results challenge the conclusions found in the existing literature.  First, we find only a weak relationship between several measures of child health and child cognitive development.  Second, we find that additional maternal schooling does not improve child cognitive achievement.  Finally, our estimates of the effect of mother's labor force participation suggest that working has a positive impact on child cognitive achievement.\n\n",
