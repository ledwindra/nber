    "abstract": "\n\nMany questions in economics involve long-run or trend variation and covariation in time series. Yet, time series of typical lengths contain only limited information about this long-run variation. This paper suggests that long-run sample information can be isolated using a small number of low-frequency trigonometric weighted averages, which in turn can be used to conduct inference about long-run variability and covariability. Because the low-frequency weighted averages have large sample normal distributions, large sample valid inference can often be conducted using familiar small sample normal inference procedures.  Moreover, the general approach is applicable for a wide range of persistent stochastic processes that go beyond the familiar I(0) and I(1) models.\n\n",
