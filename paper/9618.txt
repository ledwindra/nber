ABSTRACT
This paper clarifies one of the puzzling results of the economic growth literature: the impact of
military expenditure is frequently found to be non-significant or negative, yet most countries spend
a large fraction of their GDP on defense and the military. We start by empirical evaluation of the
non-linear interactions between military expenditure, external threats, corruption, and other relevant
controls. While growth falls with higher levels of military spending, given the values of the other
independent variables, we show that military expenditure in the presence of threats increases growth.
We explain the presence of these non-linearities in an extended version of Barro and Sala-i-Martin
(1995), allowing the dependence of growth on the severity of external threats, and on the effective
military expenditure associated with these threats.

1. Introduction
This paper studies the long-run impact of military expenditure on growth. A well known
empirical regularity is the low impact of government expenditure on growth. This result was
obtained in Barro’s cross-country growth regression investigation, where the coefficient of
government expenditure on growth is frequently non-significant. This finding applies also for
military expenditures, the impact of which is frequently found to be non-significant or negative
(see Barro and Sala-i-Martin, 1995).1
We conjecture that these findings are due to non-linearities and omitted variable biases.
Consequently, the ultimate growth effects of military expenditure can be traced only after
controlling properly for the interaction between the intensity of threats and military expenditure.
We validate this conjecture by estimating growth equations for a cross-section of countries over
the period 1989-98, identifying the presence of non-linear interaction between threats and
military expenditure. This is done by adding a constructed measure of military threats to the
conventional growth regressions, allowing for non-linear interactions. Our findings validate the
conjecture, showing that military expenditure in the presence of threats increases growth.
We provide the theoretical underpinning for the interaction between military expenditure and
threats by extending Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995) to account for the impact of military
expenditure on growth. We do it in a framework that recognizes the adverse impacts of hostile
external threats and actions on growth, in the presence of rent seeking and corruption. We also
provide empirical evidence of non-linear interaction effects of corruption when analyzing the
impact of military spending on growth.
We close the paper with discussion of possible extensions to the analysis of the analysis. We
suggest avenues for further empirical examination of the relation between growth and military
spending. We also discuss extensions to the theoretical framework, including possible linkages

accumulation, and learning by doing.
2. Threats, Military Expenditure and Growth: Empirical Evidence
We start the investigation with the following conjecture:
•

The impact of military expenditure on growth is a non-linear function of the effective
militarized threat posed by foreign countries and other external forces. Threats without
expenditure for military security reduce growth, military expenditure without threats
would reduce growth, while military expenditure in the presence of sufficiently large
threats increases growth.

More specifically, denoting real growth by gy military expenditures by mil, and a country’s
effective threat by thr, our conjecture may be expressed as

∂gy
= a1 + a2 thr;
∂mil

a1 < 0, a2 > 0

∂gy
= b1 + b2 mil ;
∂thr

b1 < 0, b2 > 0

This in turn suggests a growth equation specification of
gy = a1mil + a2 (thr )( mil ) + b1thr + β X ;

a1 < 0, b1 < 0, a2 > 0

where X is a set of control variables.2 The direct effects of military spending and external threats
on growth are assumed negative, while the interactive effect is positive.
As a preliminary effort to empirically support our conjecture, we provide results from
estimating the growth equation above for a cross-section of countries over the period 1989-98.
Description of Data
We construct gy from data on real per capita GDP from the Penn World Tables, version 6.1
(PWT6.1). Transition countries are excluded from the sample.
mil is measured as the average of the ratio of nominal military expenditures to nominal GDP
over the period 1989-98, using data obtained from the World Bank World Development

2

For simplicity, a2 is constrained equal to b2 . These coefficients would differ in circumstances where
growth is impacted by higher moments of mil and thr.

Indicators 2002 CD-ROM.3 Since this source provides data on military spending for the years
1989-98 only, this effectively constrained the length of the time series used in constructing our
cross-section averages; in future work we intend to extend the series from other sources.4
We proxy a country’s degree of external threat by counting the number of wars and
adversaries against whom it has been involved in conflict. Specifically, thr is defined as the
number of years a country was at war with each of its adversaries during the period 1970 to 1998
summed over the set of its adversaries. Thus the external threat faced by a country rises with the
number of wars in which is has been engaged, the number of adversaries it faces in each war, as
well as with the number of years that each war persists.5 This variable was constructed from data
on militarized interstate disputes collected by the Correlates of War Project (COW) at the
University of Michigan.6

3

The World Bank reports the ratio of military expenditures to GNP; we converted these figures into ratios
relative to GDP.

4

The source of the World Bank data on military spending is the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency
(ACDA). While the ACDA has reported figures for 10-year rolling periods in its (more or less) annual
publication World Military Expenditures and Arms Transfers as far back as the 1960s, various problems
of consistency must be addressed before they can be assembled into a single panel time series. The
main problem concerns how the ACDA converts local currency spending data into current or real dollar
terms for comparison across countries and time; this problem is much less severe when the spending
data is scaled by GDP. An alternative source sometimes used by other researchers in this area is the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). However, the SIPRI data face consistency
issues as well; moreover, its country coverage is smaller than that provided by the ACDA. For a
comparison of problems with military spending data from various sources, see Happe and WakemanLinn (1994).

5

Possible permutations of this measure include weighting conflicts by their intensity or by the timing of
their occurrence, including potential threats from neighbors or other countries that did not manifest
themselves in actual wars over the period, and taking account of the military capabilities of actual or
potential adversaries. Another possible extension of our analysis is taking account of the occurrence of
civil wars and internal threats that may also influence the magnitude of military spending. We will
pursue permutations of our threat measure that take account of these factors in future research.

6

We use Zeev Maoz’s dyadic data set DYMID1.1, a revised version of the COW dataset for MID2.1
(webpage: http://spirit.tau.ac.il/zeevmaoz). This data set codes the level of hostility reached in a given
country's conflict with other opposing state(s), where 2 = threat of force, 3 = display of force, 4 = use of
force (short of war), and 5 = war. We construct our threat variable with disputes of hostility level 5,
which generally involve more than 1,000 battle deaths. The data set is extended from 1992 through
1997 with information on “Major Episodes of Political Violence, 1946-1999” from the University of
Maryland’s Center for Systemic Peace (CSP) and The Statesman’s Yearbook (webpage:
http://members.aol.com/CSPmgm/cspframe.htm).

We also include a standard set of control variables typically used in the empirical growth
literature (e.g. Barro and Sala-i-Martin, 1995, Ch. 12). These controls include the initial levels of
per capita real GDP and education, population growth, and the investment rate, among other
variables. More specifically, our control variables include lgdp, the log of real per capita GDP in
1975; leduc, the log of the number of years of schooling attained by males aged 25 and over at
the secondary and higher levels in 1975; gpop, population growth over 1989-98; and inv/gdp, the
average real investment/ GDP ratio over 1984-88. Data on GDP levels, population, and
investment/GDP ratios are drawn from PWT6.1; the education data are taken from the from
Barro-Lee data set (website:www2.cid.harvard.edu/ciddata/barrolee).7
Summary statistics for mil, thr, gy, and our other control variables are shown in Table 1.
Military spending as a share of GDP ranges from 0 to more than 40 percent (for Kuwait). Our
threat count variable ranges from 0 to 15 (for Vietnam).8 The unconditional correlation of mil
and thr is 0.33, and the correlation conditioned on data availability for the variables in our
growth equation is 0.48, implying countries with higher levels of military spending also tend to
face greater external threats. Figure 1 gives a scatter plot illustrating the same positive relation
between these variables (with observations indicated by three-letter country labels).9 This finding
supports our view of the importance of taking account of the interaction of military spending and
the level of “need” for military services when analyzing the impact of military spending on
economic growth.

7

The education data is available for only 99 countries and is the main constraint on the number of
countries included in our cross-section regression analysis.

8

Kuwait and Vietnam are both eliminated when the sample is conditioned on the availability of all of the
variables entering into our growth equation specification. In the latter case, Israel is the country with the
highest level of mil (10.5 percent of GDP) and Iran is the country with the highest value of thr (9).

The observations are conditioned on data availability for all of the variables in the estimated growth
equation.

Empirical Results
We test the relationship among our variables more formally by estimating our growth
equation with ordinary least squares.10 The results are shown in Table 2.
The control variables have the expected signs and are significant at conventional levels. Per
capita growth depends positively on the education level and investment rate and negatively on
population growth. We also find evidence of the usual conditional convergence result: countries
with high initial income levels grow more slowly.11
The three columns of Table 1 compare the effects on growth of including our measures of
military spending and external threat.
Column (1) in Table 1 shows the effect of including only the ratio of military spending to
GDP. The estimated coefficient is negative, but is highly insignificant (the p level is .59). This
result accords with that of Barro (1991a, 1991b) and Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995) who fail to
find any significant effect of military spending on growth.12 As shown in column (2), adding our
threat measure as an explanatory variable, increases the magnitude (in absolute value) of the
coefficient on military spending, but it is still not significant at conventional levels (the p-level is
0.11). Moreover, the coefficient on thr, though very significant, is positive, implying that
external conflicts have a positive effect on growth, contrary to our expectation.
However, as shown in column (3), including an interactive term involving mil and thr
provides support for our conjecture. mil now has a very significant (at better than 1%) and
10

We ignore concerns about the possibly endogeneity of our explanatory variables. We also do not take
account of the possible impact of military spending on physical or human capital investment. To the
extent that military spending crowds out such investment, our results should understate the impact of
military expenditures on growth.

11

Our estimated conditional rate of convergence ranges from 1.6 to 1.9 percent (in absolute value) and is
somewhat smaller than that found by others. This can be attributed to the fact that other studies
typically measure growth over a much longer period—25 to 30 years—compared to our period length
of only 11 years.

12

Barro (1991a, 1991b) finds no effect of military spending on growth for a single cross-section of
countries over the period 1960-85, while Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995, Table 12-3) find no effect
when the sample consists of two nonoverlapping panels of ten years each for the period 1965-85.
Martin Knight, Loayza, and Villanueva (1996) also find that the military spending ratio has an
insignificant effect on growth in a cross-section over the 1971-85 period; however, the effect is
significant and negative when they utilize a panel estimator applied to three non-overlapping five-year
periods. These studies all include a separate dummy variable indicating whether a country participated
in one or more wars over the sample period.

negative direct effect on growth. The coefficient on thr is now negative, as expected (though it is
not significant), implying a higher level of external threat directly reduces growth.
The coefficient on the interactive term is significant (at a 5% level) and positive, as conjectured:
the presence of threats (algebraically) raises the marginal impact of military expenditures on
growth.
In fact, the coefficients on mil and mil*thr imply that for threat levels below (above) 3.5
(=0.56/0.16) greater military spending has an overall negative (positive) effect on growth.
Quantitatively, the estimated impact of military spending ranges from a low of -0.56 for
countries with no threats to a high of 0.88 for a country with the maximum threat level.13 That is,
the effect of a 1 percentage point increase in the military spending/GDP ratio varies from a
reduction in growth by almost 0.6 of a percentage point to an increase in growth by almost 0.9
percentage points. [J: Last sentence may be redundant, but I wanted to clarify the units.]
As a check on the results, the growth equation was reestimated by interacting mil with two
separate dummy variables: one for countries facing low threats, i.e. with values of thr less than
3.5 (the break point level identified above), and the other for countries with high threat levels,
i.e. with values of thr greater than 3.5. (Separate intercepts for low and high threat countries were
also included in place of a common constant term.) This specification results in an estimated
coefficient for mil of –0.47 (s.e. = 0.20) in the low threat range and of 0.26 (s.e. = 0.27) in the
high threat range. That is, the effect of mil on growth is negative when thr is low and positive
when thr is high.14 These estimated coefficients are jointly significantly different from zero (pvalue= 0.04) and also significantly different from each other (p-value = 0.03) Thus this piecewise linear specification implies a relationship similar to that found in the specification including
the interaction term between mil and thr.
Figures 2 and 3 graphically illustrate the relationship among growth, military spending, and
threats. Figure 2 shows the partial relation between growth and military spending, as implied by
the regression from column 3 of Table 2, with the interaction effect of mil and thr included. The

13

Since the sample median of thr is 0, when evaluated at this value of of thr the marginal effect of
military spending on growth is also -.56. When evaluated at the sample mean of thr (0.76), an increase
in military spending reduces growth by (0.56 – 0.16*0.76=) 0.44 of a percentage point.

14

Note that the negative direct effect of thr on growth implies that greater threat levels do not necessarily
lead to an overall rise in growth.

horizontal axis plots military spending for the countries included in the regression sample. The
vertical axis shows the corresponding growth rate of GDP after filtering out the effects explained
by all explanatory variables other than mil, including the direct effect of thr and the interactive
term.15 The negative slope apparent in the scatter plot is consistent with the negative relation
reported for the regression; that is, growth falls with higher levels of military spending, given the
values of the other independent variables (including the interaction effect).
Figure 3 shows the partial relations between the growth rate and military spending ratio for
the low and high ranges of the threat variable identified earlier. In the top panel, where thr is
below 3.5, the estimated relation is negative. In the bottom panel, where thr is above 3.5, the
estimated relation is positive.
3. Theoretical Model

We model the interaction of growth, military spending, and external threats by extending
Barro (1990). To simplify, we assume zero population growth. Output per worker is impacted
positively by infrastructure supplied by the public sector, and negatively by the magnitude of the
external threat. The reduced form of output is

y = A (k )

1−α

(g)

α

f

(1)

where A is an exogenous productivity factor, k is the capital/labor ratio, g is the
infrastructure/labor ratio, and 1 - f measures the output cost of the threat posed by foreign rivals’
actual or potential hostile actions. We assume that this cost depends negatively on domestic
military expenditures and positively on an index of the magnitude of the threat; for simplicity we
adopt the following functional form:16

15

The residual is calculated from the regression that contains all of the variables, including mil, thr, and
mil*thr. But the contribution from military spending is left out when computing the unexplained part of
gy plotted on the vertical axis in the scatter diagram. Constructing residual growth in this manner
implicitly evaluates the marginal effect of military spending by assuming each country faces no
external threat. (The residuals are normalized to have a mean of 0.)

16

This form allows a tractable solution. Our analysis applies for other functional forms, including a
logistic specification. See Hirshleifer (1995), Skaperdas (1996), and Epstein (1997) for models of
military conflicts illustrating the importance of considering relative military efforts among rivals in
modeling and determining conflict outcomes.

f gm > 0, f z < 0, f (0, z ) = 0, f (∞, z ) = 1, 0 < f < 1

(2)

where g m is domestic military expenditure and z is the foreign threat level. Note that this
specification implies that z is measured in units comparable to that of domestic military
expenditure so that g m and z may be aggregated.17
Corruption may also be introduced into the model as activity that taxes fiscal expenditures on
military and non-military government spending at a rate of t c . Hence, output with corruption is

y = A (k )

gm [1 − tc ]
gm [1 − tc ] + z

(3)

We denote the ratio of military to non-military infrastructure expenditure by φ ,

gm = φ g .

(4)

Thus, the total fiscal outlay on both military and non-military spending is (1 + φ ) g .18

The rest of the model’s specification is identical to that of Barro (1990). The fiscal outlay is
financed by a proportional tax τ :
(1 + φ ) g = τy .

The optimal pattern of taxes and spending (denoted by τ% , φ% ) that determine the size of the
military sector and maximize the growth rate is given by19
17

This suggests that the external threat level may be proxied by the level of foreign military expenditures,
rather than the incidences of conflict between the domestic country and its foreign rivals, as in our
empirical analysis in Section 2.

18

Note that the share of military spending out of total government expenditures is
gm /( gm + g ) = φ /(1 + φ ) ; the military spending-to-output ratio is gm / y = φτ /(1 + φ ) . Also note that,
though gm /( gm + g ) and gm / y are bounded by 1, φ is not.

Equation (8a) equates the tax rate ( τ = ( g + gm ) / y , and thereby also the government’s
expenditure share) to the output elasticity with respect to the marginal product of nonmilitary
spending, α , magnified at the rate φ ( the ratio of military to non-military government
expenditure).20 In the absence of military spending, (8a) reduces to τ = α , the standard
production efficiency condition, as derived by Barro (1990). From equation (8b) we can infer
that the military expenditure ratio, φ, depends positively on the external threat (normalized by the
domestic stock of capital), positively on the corruption level, and negatively on the productivity
level:

φ% = φ% ( z, tc , A); φ% z > 0, φ%t > 0, φ% A < 0; φ% (0, tc , A) = 0.
c

(9)

Correspondingly, from (8a) it follows

τ~ = τ~( z, tc , A); τ~z > 0; τ~t > 0; τ~A < 0.
c

Figure 4 plots the relation between military spending and the threat level implied by (8b) and
(9).21 In the absence of threats, z = 0 , then φ% = 0 , i.e. the optimal amount of military spending is
zero. For positive threat levels, z > 0 , however, φ% > 0 , i.e. the optimal level of military spending
is positive. As the threat level increases, the optimal amount of military spending increases
monotonically. Figure 4 also illustrates the effect of parametrically increasing the corruption rate,
tc . The solid line depicts the benchmark relation between φ and z (for tc = .1 ); the dashed line

19

See the mathematical appendix for the derivation. These results were obtained by solving
simultaneously the first-order conditions associated with the problem of maxφ ,τ [γ ] . This maximization
is subject to the constraints imposed by (3)-(5), applying the implicit function theorem. We assume that
the magnitude of the productivity coefficient and the rate of time preference meet the conditions leading
to positive endogenous growth. See Barro (1990) and Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995) for further details.

20

With optimally set tax and expenditure rates, it is straightforward to show that g / y = α and gm / y = αφ% .

depicts the effect of increasing the corruption rate (to tc = .2 ). Evidently, higher corruption
implies a higher optimal level of military spending for any given threat level.
A useful characterization of equilibrium government spending is that the optimal share of
military expenditure is proportional to the output cost of external threats, 1 − f (see the appendix
for the derivation):
~

φ =

1− f

α

.

(10)

In the absence of threats, the optimal level of military spending is zero, the output cost of
threats is zero (f = 1), and output is a standard CRS function of k and g (see equation (1)).
Correspondingly, the optimal tax rate ( τ% ) equals the output share of government services ( α ),
and is independent of scale effects (as follows from (8a) and (10)). The presence of threats and
hostile actions, however, implies positive military spending and output costs (f < 1), and adds a
non-linear multiplicative term (f ) to output.
This in turn adds a scale consideration to the design of optimal tax and spending rates,
summarized by (see the appendix):

the output share of nonmilitary spending ( α ) equals the output cost of external threats ( 1 − f ),
which in turn equals the magnitude of the foreign threat ( z ) relative to the aggregate effective
military expenditure by the domestic country and its foreign rival ( g~ (1 − t ) + z ), where

“effective” implies net of corruption tax. Consequently, an exogenous increase in the foreign
threat level, z , increases the optimal spending and tax rates, φ% and τ% .
Hence, the foreign hostility level impacts growth adversely due to two compounding effects:
the direct adverse growth effect associated with the resultant drop of the marginal product of
capital (see equation (7)), magnified by the adverse effects associated with the higher tax rate
induced by lower productivity. Applying the same logic, it follows that higher corruption ( tc )
and lower domestic productivity (A) increase military spending and the optimal tax rate and

10

reduce growth. Accordingly, we can derive the following reduced-form expression for optimal
output growth:

γ% = γ% ( z, tc , A); γ%z < 0, γ%t < 0, γ%A > 0.
c

In addition, we may determine that (see the appendix for the derivation)

∂ 2γ~
~ < 0 and ~ > 0 ,

thus confirming the nonlinear theoretical relationship between growth and military spending that
we conjectured and tested empirically in Section 2.
We illustrate these results in Figure 5, which plots the corresponding relation between the
optimal levels of growth and military spending, while holding constant the levels of external
threat and corruption. 22 Higher military spending reduces growth, ceteris paribus. A higher
threat level shifts the entire locus upward.
4. Military Expenditure, Corruption, and Growth: Empirical Evidence

Our theoretical model suggests that the relation between military expenditure and growth
also depends on corruption and rent seeking behavior. In particular, by acting as a tax on fiscal
expenditures, corruption raises the desired level of military spending. Accordingly, we
conjecture:
•

The impact of military expenditure on growth is a non-linear function of the level of
corruption. Military expenditure in the presence of corruption reduces growth.

In this section we present some empirical evidence concerning the association between
military spending, corruption, and growth.23 We initially abstract from the role of external threats
considered in the empirical analysis of Section 2.

22

Figure 5 is calibrated by assuming α = .2 , tc = .1, σ = 1, ρ = .02 , z / k = .0001 (for the solid
line), z / k = .001 (for the dashed line), and parametrically varying A to determine φ% and γ% . See the
appendix.

23

See Gupta, de Mello and Sharan (2000) for evidence that corruption raises military spending with a
panel data set covering the period 1985-98.

11

As our measure of corruption, we employ the index constructed by Tanzi and Davoodi
(1997) based on data from Business International (BI) and the International Country Risk Guide
(ICRG). The Tanzi-Davoodi measure, ranges from 0 (most corrupt) to 10 (least corrupt), and
hence may be interpreted as an increasing index of “good government” practices.24 The
explanatory variable goodgov is defined as the average level of this index over the period 198995.25 The unconditional correlation of mil and goodgov is –0.18, implying that the military
spending share of GDP tends to fall with good government and rise with corruption.26 However,
when the sample is restricted only to countries with data available for all of the variables in our
growth equation, the correlation is only -.02.27 Figure 6 plots the good government index against
the ratio of military spending to GDP for this restricted sample. No clear relationship is apparent
in the scatter.
Table 3 reports the effects of including corruption in our model of growth, along with the
same control variables used in Table 2; a dummy for sub-Saharan African countries has also
been added.
As column (1) of Table 3 indicates, the coefficient on our good government variable is
positive and significant, implying better government and less corruption has a positive effect on
growth.28 An improvement in the good government index by one unit (on a scale of 0 to 10) is

24

The BI index ranges from 0 to 10, while the ICRG index ranges from 1 to 6. Tanzi and Davoodi splice
the two series together to form a single 0-10 index for 1980 to 1995. The Tanzi-Davoodi measure
refers specifically to the extent of bribes and other illegal payments demanded by government officials
in business dealings and other transactions. The ICRG also collects data on a number of other measures
of institutional quality, including maintenance of the rule of law, quality of the bureaucracy, risk of
expropriation, and risk of repudiation of government contracts.

25

Our results below are unaffected if we define goodgov as the level of corruption for 1989, the initial
year of our sample.

26

A linear regression of mil on goodgov gives a coefficient of .47, with t-statistic of 1.99.

27

The observations are conditioned on data availability for all of the variables in the estimated growth
equation reported in Table 3 below.

28

This marginal effect is calculated conditional on a country having the highest level of corruption, i.e.
goodgov = 0. When evaluated at the sample median of goodgov (5.36), an increase in military spending
reduces growth by only (-1.27+ 0.20*5.36 =) -0.20 of a percentage point. When evaluated at the
sample mean of goodgov (6.00), an increase in military spending reduces growth by (-1.27+ 0.20*6.0
=) -0.07.

estimated to raise the growth rate by 0.50 percentage point.29 This finding accords with that of
Mauro (1995), among others.30 Column (2) indicates that the significance of corruption is robust
to adding the ratio of military spending to GDP, but the latter is highly insignificant (the p level
is 0.85). However, as shown in column (3), including an interactive term involving mil and
goodgov provides support for a nonlinear relation between military spending, corruption, and
growth. mil now has a very significant (at better than 1%) and negative direct effect on growth.
The direct effect of goodgov on growth is now insignificant, but the coefficient on the interactive
term is significant (at a 1% level) and positive, implying military expenditure in the presence of
better government raises growth.31 This result is consistent with our model.
In fact, the coefficients on mil and mil*goodgov imply that for threat levels above 6.35
(=1.27/0.20) greater military spending has an overall positive effect on growth. Analogously to
our analysis of the role of external threats, the growth equation was reestimated by interacting
goodgov with separate dummy variables for countries with low and high levels of goodgov, i.e.
with values of goodgov less than and greater than the cutoff value of 6.35, respectively. (Separate
intercepts were also included in place of a common constant term.) This specification results in
an estimated coefficient for goodgov of –0.35 (s.e. = 0.17) in the low range and of 0.26
(s.e.=0.19) in the high range. That is, the effect of mil on growth is negative when goodgov is
low and positive when it’s high. These estimated coefficients are jointly significantly different
from zero (p-value= 0.03) and also significantly different from each other (p-value = 0.01) Thus
this piece-wise linear specification implies a relationship similar to that found in the specification
including the interaction term between mil and thr.
Figure 7 plots the partial relation between growth and military spending, as implied by the
regression from column (3) of Table 3. The vertical axis shows the growth rate of GDP after
filtering out the effects explained by all explanatory variables other than mil (including the direct

29

Since the standard deviation of the goodgov variable is 2.31, a one standard deviation improvement
would imply growth falls by .22 of a percentage point.

30

Tanzi and Davoodi (1997, 2000) find indirect evidence that corruption decreases growth by reducing
government revenue and the productivity of public investment. Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995), find
that the ICRG’s “rule of law” measure of institutional quality has a positive effect on growth.

The coefficients on mil and mil*goodgov imply that for index levels of good government above 6.35

effect of goodgov and the interactive term). The negative slope apparent in the scatter plot is
consistent with the negative relation reported for the regression; that is, growth falls with higher
levels of military spending, given the values of the other independent variables, including
corruption.
These results highlight the need to control for nonlinear interaction effects of corruption
when analyzing the effect of military spending on growth.
We conclude this section by simultaneously considering the empirical effects of external
threats and corruption on military spending and growth. We do so by dividing our sample into
two subsamples according to the mean level of corruption, 6.00. Table 4 reports the results of
estimating the nonlinear effects of military spending and threats on growth for each of these two
samples. As shown in Column (1), the coefficient on mil and mil*thr have the expected negative
and positive signs, respectively, for “high” corruption countries, i.e. the countries with low
indices of good government (goodgov < 6.0). For this subsample, the estimated coefficient for
mil is –0.81 and significant at 1%; the coefficient on the interaction term is 0.22 and significant
at better than 5%. 32 In contrast, for the “low” corruption countries (i.e. goodgov > 6.0), the
coefficients on mil and the interaction term are insignificant (and the coefficient on mil is
actually positive in sign). Thus the effects of mil on growth in our sample appear to hold
primarily for countries with greater corruption.
5. Discussion and Future Research

Our theoretical model suggests that military expenditure induced by external threats should
increase growth (using the proper controls), while military expenditure induced by rent seeking
and corruption should reduce growth. We have confirmed the basic conjectures implied by the
theoretical model regarding the nonlinear relation between military spending, corruption, and
growth in a cross-country regression growth analysis.
Our analysis suggests a number of paths of future research concerning the relation of
economic growth and military activity. One avenue is to investigate further the robustness and
stability of our empirical results. Possible steps include:

32

The results are not effected if a dummy variable for sub-Saharan African countries is included.

14

•

Analyze the sensitivity of the results to different measures of the external security threat
by weighting conflicts by their intensity and/or timing in relation to current spending,
taking account of military expenditure levels and capabilities of adversaries, and
controlling for geography-related vulnerability factors, e.g. existence of common borders
with adversaries, distance from adversaries, land border length, coastline length, etc.

•

Consider the impact of other economic control variables, such as government spending
on nonmilitary activities.33

•

Consider the effect of political factors, such as the degree of political stability, the
political orientation of the government, the political power of the military in society, and
military aid from abroad.

•

Take account of the occurrence of civil wars and internal threats that may influence
military spending and growth.

•

Expand the time series dimension of the dataset. This would permit comparison of the
time-series and cross-section association of military spending and growth using various
panel estimators, investigation of the extent to which the end of the Cold War has
influenced military spending over time (thought the “peace dividend” effect), and
analysis of the contemporaneous and lagged effects of conflict and spending on growth.

•

Investigate possible channels through which military spending may (possibly
endogenously) encourage corruption. For example, do imports from foreign arms
suppliers foster bribery in order to secure military contracts? Where the military sector
engages in commercial business operations or controls natural resources and competition
is limited, are opportunities for corruption enhanced?

Another avenue of future research is to model and test the possibility that military
expenditures generate growth externalities. Possible channels leading to potential positive
externalities include R&D and human capital accumulation. Negative externalities may arise
from corruption and costly monitoring, or from wage effects on the nontraded goods sectors
along the line of the “Dutch Disease.” 34

33

See Hewitt (1992) and Davoodi, Clements, Schiff, and Debaere (2001) for analyses of the association
of military spending and nonmilitary government spending.

34

See van Wijnbergen (1984) for a model of the “Dutch Disease.”

15

Modeling these externalities can be done by going beyond the reduced-form “AK” type of
growth model elaborated in equations (1)-(7). One approach is to apply a Lucas (1993) variant of
a two-sector growth model, with one sector producing final output and the other sector producing
human capital, which in turn is used as an input in final output production. Final output growth
would then be dependent on human capital, the accumulation of which depends on education
costs and learning-by-doing effects. In this model, low-income countries may underinvest in
human capital because of capital market imperfections, such as prohibitively high education
costs and a low initial endowment of human capital. In such countries, the wish to promote a
“competitive” military capability may induce the government to engage in activities that
effectively subsidize the formation of human capital, addressing indirectly the distortions
induced by the capital market imperfections. If these effects were powerful enough (and if the
military expenditure does not lead to countervailing adverse effects due to corruption and rent
seeking), the net outcome would be growth enhancing.
One expects these effects to be weak in the poorest countries, as a threshold of resources and
human capital may be necessary to allow formation of an effective education system. These
effects would tend to be weak in rich countries as well, where high enough income per capita
would allow the private sector to self-finance education. Consequently, it may be conjectured
that it is primarily in middle income countries that military expenditures may deliver strong
growth effects due to externalities operating via the education system.
These theoretical extensions suggest questions for further empirical research:
•

Do positive growth externalities from military activities exist in countries where the
human capital/worker ratio (or alternatively, the physical capital/labor ratio) in the
military sector exceeds that in the overall economy?

•

Are the externalities of military spending stronger in middle-income countries than in low
or high-income countries, as the suggested extension to our model implies?

•

What other factors determine the size of these externalities? e.g. Do they depend on the
degree of market-orientation of the economy? Do international arms exports generate
growth externalities? Does the composition of military spending, i.e. spending on military
personnel vs. capital equipment (e.g. airplanes, tanks, etc.) matter?

Mathematical Appendix

The purpose of this Appendix is to derive equations (8a) and (8b) and characterize the
properties of the determinants of the optimal tax, spending, and growth rates. Note first that
equations (3)-(5) define output as an implicit function of the tax rate , τ , and military spending
ratio, φ :
y = y (τ , φ ) .

(A1)

From (1) and (7) it follows that the optimization problem may be expressed as

Note: Conditional correlation calculated from a regression for gy that contains all of the
growth variable controls in Table 2 as well as mil*lowthr and mil*highthr, where lowthr is
a dummy defined equal to 1 for countries with a level of thr < 3.5.and highthr is a dummy
defined equal to 1 for countries with level of thr >3.5. (The dummies are also included as
separate intercepts in the regression.) Panel a plots on the vertical axis the unexplained
part of gy after filtering out the contribution of all variables except mil*lowthr; panel b
filters out the effects of all variables except mil*highthr .

Figure 4. Optimal Military Spending and External Threat Level

Note: φ is the optimal ratio of military spending to non-military spending; z/k denotes the external
threat level (normalized by the capital stock). The plots are calibrated by assuming A=1, α = .2 ,
and tc set equal to .1 (solid line) or .2 (dashed line).

Figure 5. Optimal Growth and Military Spending

Note:

γ

is the optimal growth rate;

φ

is the optimal ratio of military spending to non-

military spending. Plots are calibrated by assuming

α = .2 , tc = .1, σ = 1, ρ = .02 ,

z / k = .0001 (solid line), z / k = .001 (dashed line), and parametrically varying
A to determine φ% through equations (8a) and (A10) in the appendix.
