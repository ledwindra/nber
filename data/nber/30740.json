    "abstract": "\n\nWe use public finance sufficient statistic approaches to characterize the welfare effects of \u201cnudges,\u201d such as simplified information and warning labels, in markets with taxes and endogenous prices. While many studies focus on average effects, we show that welfare also depends on how the nudge affects the variance of choice distortions, and average effects become irrelevant with zero pass-through or optimal taxes. We implement the framework with experiments evaluating automotive fuel economy labels and sugary drink health labels. Labels decrease purchases of low-fuel economy cars and sugary drinks but may decrease welfare, because they increase the variance of choice distortions.\n\n",

We thank the National Science Foundation, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, National Institute on Aging (via the NBER Roybal Center grant #P30AG034532), and Time Sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences for grant funding. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship under Grant No. DGE-2234667. The experiment was approved by Institutional Review Boards at NYU (protocol number FY2020-3805) and Berkeley (#2020-08-13558) and was registered in the American Economic Association Registry for randomized trials (available from www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/7460) and at ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05038163). Because most of our empirical analyses involve a structural model that would have been difficult to pre-specify, we did not submit a pre-analysis plan with the pre-registration.
