    "abstract": "\n\nDoes combating corruption reduce clientelism? We examine the impact of a prominent anti-corruption program on clientelism using a novel representative survey of rural Brazilians. Randomized audits reduce politicians\u2019 provision of campaign handouts, decrease citizens\u2019 demands for private goods, and reduce requests fulfilled by politicians. We investigate mechanisms by which audits may reduce clientelism, and find that audits significantly reduce citizens\u2019 willingness to supply clientelist votes. Results also offer novel insights into audits\u2019 dynamic effects: they have more pronounced effects in the short run, especially during electoral periods.\n\n",
