The Impact of the Affordable Care Act: Evidence from California's Hospital Sector

NBER Working Paper No. 25488
January 2019
JEL No. H51,I13,L33
ABSTRACT
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) authorized the largest expansion of public health insurance in the
U.S. since the mid-1960s. We exploit ACA-induced changes in the discontinuity in coverage at age
65 using a regression discontinuity based design to examine effects of the expansion on health insurance
coverage, hospital use, and patient health. We then link these changes to effects on hospital finances.
We show that a substantial share of the federally-funded Medicaid expansion substituted for existing
locally-funded safety net programs. Despite this offset, the expansion produced a substantial increase
in hospital revenue and profitability, with larger gains for government hospitals. On the benefits side,
we do not detect significant improvements in patient health, although the expansion led to substantially
greater hospital and emergency room use, and a reallocation of care from public to private and better-quality
hospitals.

INTRODUCTION
The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) led to the largest expansion of publicly

funded health insurance coverage since the introduction of Medicare and Medicaid more than fifty years
ago. The main provisions of this legislation took effect in January 2014. In states that elected to expand
their Medicaid programs as allowed for by the ACA, individuals with family incomes at or below 138
percent of the federal poverty line and without another source of coverage could enroll in the means-tested
Medicaid program. Those with incomes above this threshold and without another source of coverage could
sign up for private health insurance coverage in ACA exchanges. Exchange enrollees could qualify for
federal subsidies to purchase health insurance if their family incomes were below 400 percent of the federal
poverty line. From 2010 to 2017, the number of Medicaid recipients nationally rose from 54 million to 72
million while the number with coverage in the ACA exchanges increased from 0 to 12 million (CMS, 2018).
This intervention offers a unique opportunity to examine the effects of a large expansion of public
health insurance in a modern setting. We focus on the state of California, which was one of 25 states that
elected to expand Medicaid in January 2014. 1 We analyze the effects of the ACA-induced expansion in
health insurance coverage through the lens of the hospital sector in California, using data on the universe
of hospital stays and emergency room (ER) visits in the state as well as detailed data on hospital finances
from 2008 through 2016. During this period, Medicaid enrollment in the state increased from approximately
8 million to more than 13 million while Medicaid spending more than doubled from $40 billion to $100
billion (Taylor, 2017). Additionally, nearly 1.4 million Californians obtained their health insurance through
the state’s ACA health insurance exchange (known as Covered California) in 2016, the final year of our
study period.
We use a novel empirical approach that exploits the pre-existing discontinuity in health insurance
coverage at age 65 due to the discrete onset of eligibility for Medicare. 2 This phenomenon has been used
by other studies as a quasi-random insurance coverage experiment to examine the effects of Medicare (Card
et al. 2008; 2009). The ACA substantially expanded the Medicaid eligibility criteria for non-elderly
individuals in California, leading to a large increase in Medicaid coverage for those under the age of 65, as
shown in Figure 1a, which plots the fraction of individuals at each age with Medicaid coverage in each year
from 2011 through 2016. Because Medicaid eligibility criteria were already fairly broad for those under
age 21, the effect on Medicaid coverage was greatest for those aged 21 to 64.

1

25 states, including Washington, D.C., expanded their Medicaid programs in January 2014. In the five years since January 2014,
an additional 12 states have expanded or are in the process of expanding Medicaid as called for in the ACA. Many of the remaining
14 states are actively considering an expansion.
2
A small share of individuals who are eligible for Medicaid at age 64 retain Medicaid coverage post-65 because they are eligible
for both Medicaid and Medicare. Medicare is the primary insurer in these cases.

2

The Medicaid expansion, together with the introduction of publicly subsidized private insurance
through the ACA exchanges, caused a sharp decrease in the discontinuity at age 65, as Figure 1b
demonstrates. Our estimation approach compares the pre-post change in outcomes of interest for patients
aged 64 (or younger) who experienced an increase in coverage, relative to those 65 and older whose
insurance coverage remained unchanged through this entire period. This regression discontinuity
differences-in-differences (RD-DD) approach estimates local average treatment effects most relevant for
near-elderly individuals. Hence, we also present a companion set of results using the sample of all patients
aged 21 to 64, in which we exploit pre-ACA variation in the share potentially eligible for Medicaid across
geographic markets. Also, to address potential concerns about spurious trends, we present results from a
falsification exercise assuming a placebo expansion in 2010, as well as from event studies for all outcomes
of interest. Reassuringly, these results indicate no pre-existing trends that would bias our results.
We begin by examining the changes in health insurance coverage. First, we find no evidence of a
net increase in private coverage among eligible hospitalized patients, which implies that most obtaining
health insurance through the ACA exchanges would have had coverage through another source. We
estimate an increase of 4-6 percentage points in any form of health insurance, which is driven entirely by
the Medicaid expansion. In fact, our RD-DD results indicate minor crowd out of private coverage among
patients in their early 60s. Second, we find that about half of the Medicaid expansion replaced county safetynet programs that previously would pay for hospital care for eligible uninsured low-income patients. Since
the Medicaid expansion was financed almost entirely by the federal government, this represented a shift in
financing responsibility from local taxpayers to federal taxpayers. Results from the analysis leveraging
variation across geographic areas for all adults aged 21 to 64 are strikingly similar to those for 64- and 65year-old patients, indicating that these are robustly estimated and capture the effects for younger adults as
well. Taken together, our results imply that for every 10 individuals newly enrolling in Medicaid as a result
of the ACA, the number with health insurance increased by approximately 8.
To estimate the effect of these coverage changes on hospital finances, we utilize annual, hospitallevel financial data. Our results reveal that Medicaid reimbursed hospitals at approximately twice the level
as the pre-existing county safety net programs. Hence, the replacement of county programs with Medicaid
coverage benefited both local taxpayers as well as hospitals providing this care. Since government owned
hospitals disproportionately bore the burden of caring for uninsured low-income patients, they were also
the primary beneficiaries of this transfer from federal taxpayers. We estimate that the average government
hospital received nearly a 20% increase in total revenue per bed due to the Medicaid expansion, while the
corresponding estimate for private hospitals was 8%. This increase was driven entirely by higher average
reimbursements rather than by additional volume. In fact, government hospitals actually lost some of their
patient volume to private hospitals, which moderated the increase in their total revenues. Hospitals also
3

reported greater profitability – an average gain of 4 percentage points in their operating margins. Our
estimates imply that this increase in operating margin – when converted to dollars – is about 70% as large
as the estimated increase in Medicaid revenue. Hospitals do not seem to be deploying this income toward
greater capital spending or expanding bed capacity, at least in the short run.
This largely federally-financed windfall for hospitals and other health care providers represents the
cost of the Medicaid expansion. 3 To understand the benefits to consumers, we explore changes in utilization
of care and in patient health outcomes. A decrease in patient cost sharing may spur greater use of health
care (moral hazard) while improved access to preventative and outpatient care may decrease the need for
hospital care. This has been referred to as the access vs. efficiency tradeoff (Dafny and Gruber, 2005). We
find that the access effect dominates, with a net increase of 4-6% in hospital stays and arrivals at ERs on
average. In contrast to evidence from the Massachusetts reform (Kolstad and Kowalski, 2012; Miller, 2012)
– and contradicting a key argument for the insurance expansion – we find a robust, statistically significant
increase in ER volume. Our reduced form estimate of the resulting increase in hospital stays implies a
marginal effect three times as large as corresponding estimates from the Oregon experiment (Finkelstein et
al., 2012). 4 This highlights the potentially large magnitude of general equilibrium effects even in the short
term, likely through supply side responses by hospitals and physicians to the Medicaid expansion and higher
reimbursement.
Notwithstanding the above increase in hospital care, we fail to reject the null of no effect on patient
health. Our primary metric of health is in-hospital mortality, and we focus on the subset of patients
discharged with acute, emergent conditions such as Heart attack and Pneumonia to circumvent selection
concerns. The point estimates indicate that in-hospital mortality has declined meaningfully post-ACA,
however they are imprecisely estimated. A likely channel for improved health is reallocation of patient care
to privately-owned and better-quality hospitals. Pre-ACA, 65-year-olds were significantly more likely than
64-year-olds to receive care at privately-owned and better-quality hospitals. But this gap declined by 60%
on both dimensions post-ACA. We interpret this shift to be demand-driven, since we find a similar
magnitude of switching in ER use, which is less likely to be influenced by insurer networks.
Our analysis has three key limitations. First, our results reflect the experience of a specific state
that expanded Medicaid, and more liberally than on average. Second, we cannot observe health care
delivered outside of the hospital. This precludes testing for improvements in access to preventative and
3

The ACA did influence hospital reimbursement on other dimensions. For example, the ACA reduced the growth rate of Medicare
reimbursement rates and intended to reduce the disproportionate share (DSH) program which differentially aided hospitals serving
many low-income patients. However, Congress repeatedly delayed the cuts to DSH spending. The DSH cuts are currently set to
begin in fiscal year 2020. More details available at https://cbcny.org/research/dsh-cuts-delayed.
4
The Oregon experiment was negligibly small compared to the Medicaid expansion in California under the ACA (10,000 vs. ~5
million new enrollees). We interpret their IV results as estimating partial equilibrium effects on individual consumption of care
upon gaining Medicaid coverage, while our reduced form results capture general equilibrium effects of the Medicaid expansion in
California.

(non-ER) outpatient care, though we examine trends in potentially avoidable stays and find no change.
Third, these results estimate only the short-term effects of the ACA and we acknowledge that the long-term
effects, particularly on patient health, may be different.
This paper makes three primary contributions to the existing literature. First, we highlight the
locally-funded safety net program in California and use a novel empirical approach to quantify its
substitution by Medicaid under the expansion. This aspect has received little attention in previous
assessments of insurance coverage changes following the ACA (Sommers et al., 2014; Sommers et al.,
2016; Courtemanche et al., 2017a; Frean et al., 2017 and many others), perhaps because administrative
surveys do not record safety net payers since those benefiting would not typically report being insured.
These results also provide empirical evidence to confirm speculation by recent studies (Finkelstein et al.,
2015; Finkelstein et al., 2017) that Medicaid beneficiaries value the program substantially below cost since
it often replaces other parts of the safety net.
Second, we extend existing work on supply side effects of the ACA (Blavin, 2016; Lindrooth et
al., 2018) by linking the Medicaid expansion to changes in hospital finances, particularly government
owned hospitals. The Medicaid expansion resulted in a substantial transfer from federal taxpayers, split
between hospitals and local taxpayers in California. It remains unclear how this additional revenue was
deployed by hospitals other than increasing operating margins. This also relates to recent evidence on
hospital sensitivity to insurance coverage changes (Garthwaite et al., 2016).
Third, examining the universe of hospital stays and ER visits allows us to quantify a large increase
in hospital use, relative to the increase in insurance coverage. We interpret the large magnitude as being
partially driven by supply side responses that encouraged hospital use. Intuitively, our estimates are about
half as large as comparable estimates of the long-term effects of Medicare (Finkelstein, 2007). We fail to
reject the null of no change in patient mortality, although the point estimates indicate some reduction. A
likely mechanism for improved health is reallocation of patients from government to privately-owned – and
better-quality – hospitals. This channel has previously received little attention as studies typically valued
Medicaid on the basis of improved health or reduced financial risk (Currie and Gruber 1996b; GoodmanBacon, 2016; Brevoort et al., 2017; Gallagher et al., 2017). Our results also extend previous work that has
focused on specific categories of care, such as ER use (Barakat et al., 2017; Garthwaite et al., 2017 and
Nikpay et al. 2017), drug prescriptions (Ghosh et. al., 2017), patients with specific diseases (Anderson et
al., 2016) or used survey data (Courtemanche et al., 2017b).
Our results take on additional significance when one considers state decision-making regarding the
Medicaid expansion, which as a result of a 2012 Supreme Court decision was left up to the states rather
than mandated by the federal government. Half the states expanded Medicaid as early as possible in January
2014. But an additional 12 states have since elected to expand Medicaid, with 4 of these decisions occurring
5

in 2018. As the remaining 14 states consider whether or not to expand their Medicaid programs, evidence
regarding the effects of this expansion on insurance coverage, quality of care, and hospital finances along
with state and local spending on health care can be helpful in assessing whether to proceed.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section II provides background on insurance coverage
in California and the insurance provisions of the ACA. Section III describes the data and presents
descriptive statistics. Section IV describes the empirical strategy for the regression discontinuity approach
and presents results. Section V presents a companion set of results using geographic variation in poverty
across hospital markets. Section VI presents results on changes in hospital finances. Section VII discusses
some limitations in interpreting the results and section VIII concludes.

A.

BACKGROUND
Insurance coverage pre-ACA
The health insurance landscape prior to 2014 was characterized by relatively high uninsurance rates

among specific sub-groups. According to data gathered by the American Community Survey (ACS), about
18% of the California population was uninsured in 2012-13. While this indicates a high aggregate level of
uninsurance, it masks wide variation in insurance coverage across different age groups. The pre-ACA
uninsurance rate among non-elderly adults aged 21-64 was three times that of the remaining population
(25% vs. 8%). The elderly benefited from nearly universal coverage provided by Medicare, while children
were generously covered by Medicaid (nearly 40%).
Surveys like the ACS may overstate uninsurance rates for two reasons. First, the under-reporting
of Medicaid due to its association with welfare is well documented (Klerman et al., 2005; Meyer et al.,
2009). Second, surveys typically do not record local safety net programs. These programs fund medical
care for a subset of low-income individuals who are not eligible for Medicaid but cannot afford to buy
private health insurance. These are not considered traditional insurance since they often pay for care expost and hence do not provide risk protection. Hadley et al. (2008) estimates that about 20% of total
spending on the uninsured, or about $11 billion dollars, was covered by such local programs in 2008. This
is particularly important in our setting since California counties are legally bound to provide such safety
net care. In California, safety net programs were funded primarily through a mix of state (sales tax, vehicle
license fee, tobacco settlement funds) and county general funds. Federal funding through disproportionate
share (DSH) funds played a small role (Taylor, 2013).
Each county designs its indigent services program and thus there is substantial variation in
eligibility requirements (e.g. income, assets, residence, age, medical need and immigration status) and
services covered (California Health Care Foundation, 2009). Prior to passage of the ACA, California spent
approximately 2 billion dollars annually to care for the uninsured through the Medically Indigent Services
6

Program (MISP), which provided care in 24 mostly urban counties, and the County Medical Services
Program (CMSP), which operated in 32 predominantly rural counties (Council of Economic Advisers
2009). With the exception of some MISP counties, these services were available only to non-elderly adults.
Hence, a substantial fraction of non-elderly adults counted among the uninsured pre-ACA were at least
partially covered by county programs. Note that the provision of informal health care insurance to low
income individuals through counties or other state financed mechanisms extended beyond California.
Several other states – including those that did not expand Medicaid – offered variants of such programs.
Examples include Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, Texas, New
Mexico, Pennsylvania and Louisiana. 5 Across states, these programs vary in financing and service
coverage, but share the feature that they reimbursed hospitals for services provided to low-income
individuals ineligible for Medicaid.

B.

The Affordable Care Act
The ACA was signed into law in March 2010 with several key objectives: increasing access to

health care, introducing new consumer protections, and lowering cost and improving quality of health care.
There were two primary channels through which the ACA expanded access to health insurance, both of
which became effective on January 1, 2014. First, in all states, individuals in families with incomes between
100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) who were not already eligible for affordable health
insurance, either from an employer or from Medicaid, were now eligible for premium subsidies provided
in the form of advanced tax-credits to purchase private health insurance. Second, the ACA originally
intended to expand Medicaid eligibility to all individuals without another source of coverage with family
incomes below 133% of the FPL. However, legal challenges and a June 2012 Supreme Court decision
allowed states the choice to opt out of expanding Medicaid. California is one of the original twenty-five
states (including DC) that chose to expand Medicaid at the beginning of 2014. A dozen additional states
have since elected to expand Medicaid. Duggan et al. (2017) provides a more detailed summary of ACAmandated expansions in health insurance. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the ACA
insurance expansions directly cost the federal government $120 billion in 2017 (CBO, 2017).
Several surveys estimate the number of uninsured in the United States at the quarterly or annual
level. Gallup and Sharecare surveys show that the percent of adults without health insurance was trending

steadily upward prior to 2014, peaked around 18% in late 2013 and then sharply dropped to 11% by the
beginning of 2016. The increase in health insurance coverage is largely attributable to both ACA coverage
initiatives, with the Medicaid expansion being nearly twice as large as the exchanges.
Even among states that chose to expand Medicaid, there is substantial variation in the impact on
Medicaid enrollment. This is driven by variation across states in baseline enrollment, due to states’ initial
generosity in eligibility criteria, as well as differences in the socio-economic composition of states.
Appendix Figure A. 1 shows the percent of the state population enrolled in Medicaid in late 2013 and the
net change in enrollment between late 2013 and October 2016. Compare California and New York, where
almost one-third of residents in both states were covered through Medicaid in late 2016. However, there
was a much greater increase in California, which saw an increase of 10 percentage points compared to an
increase of just 4 percentage points in New York. New York eligibility criteria included childless adults
prior to 2014 whereas childless adults were generally not covered in California. Consequently, the
expansion of Medicaid had a much larger enrollment impact in California. Figure A. 2 displays monthly
Medicaid enrollment in California over 2010-16 and highlights the magnitude of Medicaid’s expansion and
how it dwarfs exchange enrollment. Medicaid enrollment increased from about 8.5 million in mid-2013 to
13.5 million by mid-2016. 6 However, enrollment on the newly established ACA individual insurance
exchange plateaued at 1.4 million, or about a quarter of the increase in Medicaid. Figure 1c highlights how
the dramatic increase in Medicaid translated into changes in payment for hospital care. The figure plots the
share of hospital stays by patients aged 21 to 64 between 2008 and 2016 covered by different insurers. At
the beginning of the sample period, Medicaid covered 23% patients, about half as much as private payers.
Over the next few years there was a steady upward drift in Medicaid, but even in 2013 it covered only 26%
of stays. There was a substantial jump in Medicaid coverage in 2014 due to the expansion, and by the end
of the period, Medicaid was the largest payer of hospital care – covering 43% of stays, while private payers
covered about 35%.

C.

Age based discontinuities in public insurance
Public insurance programs commonly use age-based thresholds to determine eligibility. For

example, individuals can enroll in Medicare when they turn 65, but not earlier, unless they are enrolled in
the Social Security Disability Insurance program or have end stage renal disease. Similarly, children enjoy
relatively generous eligibility rules under Medicaid until age 18 (or 19 under some circumstances) but then
often lose coverage because the eligibility criteria become more restrictive. Prior to the ACA, two such
6

The small jump in enrollment in 2013 is primarily due to the transition of children from the Healthy Families Program to Medicaid.
However, California also started to expand coverage slightly even before the primary ACA implementation launched in January
2014 through the low-income health program, which provided coverage to about 500 thousand California residents in 2012-13
(California Budget Project, 2013). This represented only about 10 percent of the eventual increase in Medicaid enrollment.

8

rules created discontinuities in insurance coverage at 21 and 65 in California. Appendix Figure A. 3 presents
an extract of California Medicaid eligibility requirements in the pre-ACA period. Welfare recipients and
disabled individuals were relatively generously covered. However, to enroll based on low income status
(“medically indigent person or family”), individuals had to be under 21. Adults aged 21 to 64 were generally
ineligible except in case of pregnancies, nursing home residence, or enrollment in the federal Supplemental
Security Income program.
To examine the magnitude of this discontinuity, we turn to administrative hospital discharge data,
acknowledging that this reflects insurance coverage conditional on using hospital care. Figure 1a presents
Medicaid’s percent of hospital stays for patients aged 10 to 75 discharged from hospitals during 2011-16.
In the pre-ACA period (2011-13), Medicaid coverage is high for children aged 10 (45-50%) and gradually
declines until age 21 when it falls precipitously by about 15 percentage points. It then varies smoothly again
until age 65 when there is another discontinuous drop of about 12 percentage points. Note that in 2013 there
was an increase in coverage for children due to the formal transfer of CHIP (Children’s health insurance
program) beneficiaries to Medicaid. In the post-ACA period (2014-16), the discontinuity at age 21 is
eliminated, while at age 65 it is enhanced since more 64-year-olds become eligible for Medicaid.
Figure 1b presents the corresponding plot (note the expanded scale) of the percent of patients that were
coded as self-pay, charity care or county indigent. Throughout the paper we collectively refer to these
categories as uninsured patients. Pre-ACA, there was a striking increase of 15 pp in uninsurance at age 21,
suggesting that the Medicaid eligibility restrictions were important. At age 65 there was an increase in
insurance coverage due to the onset of Medicare which more than compensated for the decline in Medicaid.
Post-ACA, the discontinuities in uninsurance at 21 and 65 disappear, indicating that the ACA expansions
were effective in increasing coverage for the targeted groups. Note that there is no change in Medicaid or
uninsurance at age 65 and above through this period, suggesting that this group was insulated from the
ACA insurance coverage changes, presumably due to their nearly universal Medicare coverage.
The substantial discontinuities in Medicaid and health insurance coverage at the two age thresholds
and their interaction with the ACA motivates our use of a regression discontinuity research design to
examine the effects of the ACA on a variety of outcomes.

III.

DATA
Our main source of data contains the universe of hospital stays and emergency room (ER) visits at

non-federal hospitals in the state of California for the period 2008 through 2016, obtained from California's
Office of Statewide Health, Planning, and Development (OSHPD). These confidential data include
approximately 3.8 million hospital discharges and 11 million ER visits each year. Each observation pertains
to a hospital stay or ER visit and provides information on the hospital, dates of service, patients’ primary
9

insurer type and basic demographics, a vector of up to 25 diagnoses and procedure codes, and patient zip
code of residence. As is standard in such files, if an ER visit subsequently leads to hospitalization, then it
only appears as a hospital discharge, though the record indicates whether the stay originated as an ER visit.
Crucially, we observe both a patient’s birth date and admission date and hence we can precisely calculate
a patient’s age at admission.
We impose three data restrictions for our analysis sample involving the discharge data. First, we
focus our attention on short-term general acute care hospitals to decrease the likelihood of small and specific
hospitals (for example, rehabilitation or long-term care) driving the results. This restriction decreases the
number of hospitals from 450 to 370, but retains 95% of hospital stays and nearly all ER visits. Second,
since California Medicaid eligibility rules were already generous regarding pregnancy and delivery cases
before the implementation of the ACA, we exclude pregnancy-related hospital stays or pregnancy-related
ER visits from the analysis. Third, we exclude patients residing outside of California or with missing zip
codes of residence. 7
We organize recorded insurance coverage into five categories – Medicaid, Private, Miscellaneous,
Self-pay, and County. Miscellaneous is primarily composed of Medicare, but also includes workers’
compensation and government employee plans. Self-pay includes charity cases and those who pay for their
care themselves. County refers to those covered by the county indigent program discussed above.

A.

Specific age thresholds
In order to construct the RD-DD sample for our preferred specifications we impose two further

sample restrictions. First, we exclude the years 2008-2010 from our main analysis, reserving them for the
falsification exercise and to establish baseline statistics. Our main sample therefore spans 2011-16 – three
years before and three years after the ACA expansion. Second, we limit the sample to patients admitted
within 12 months of their 65th (or 21st) birthday. In order to minimize measurement error we exclude
individuals who arrived at the hospital within 15 days of turning 65 (or 21). In robustness checks we explore
the sensitivity of our results to using larger age bandwidths. Focusing on specific age groups dramatically
curtails the sample size, leaving approximately 560,000 (150,000) hospital stays and 1.3 million (1.9
million) ER arrivals over the period 2011-16 for the elderly and young respectively. ER arrivals include
both ER visits and hospital stays that originated in the ER. Throughout the paper we prefer to analyze the
sample of ER arrivals since it enables analysis without conditioning on ER admission decisions that could
change in response to the ACA.
Table 1 Panel A summarizes descriptive statistics on the main RD-DD analysis sample of hospital
stays and ER arrivals separately for the young and elderly. The table highlights the sharp increase in
7

Approximately 1.5% of the discharge records in 2008 were for patients having either an out of state or missing zip code.

10

Medicaid’s share of discharges and the corresponding decrease in uninsurance for patients in these age
groups. We compute utilization rates as hospital stays and ER arrivals per 1,000 people per year using
California population estimates by single year of age. 8 The cohort that turned 64 in 2014 is coincidentally
also one of the earlier baby boomer cohorts and is substantially larger than the cohort one year older in age.
Hence normalizing by population helps eliminate a spurious increase in hospital volume for 64-year-olds
in the first year of the ACA. We use in-hospital mortality as our metric of patient health. When examining
effects on mortality we prefer to restrict the sample to patients discharged with a non-deferrable emergent
condition such as heart attack, pneumonia, etc. to circumvent concerns related to selection and shifts in
composition. 9 The emergent group intuitively has a greater mortality rate than do other patients.

B.

All non-elderly adults
We supplement the RD-DD results using a larger sample of all non-elderly adults (ages 21-64) and

exploit baseline variation in poverty across geographic markets. We use Hospital Service Areas (HSAs) as
our unit of analysis; this is similar to the approach used in other studies that leverage geographic variation
in baseline rates of coverage (Finkelstein, 2007; Courtemanche et al., 2017; Duggan et al., 2017; Frean et
al., 2017). 10 HSAs are defined as “collections of contiguous zip codes whose residents receive most of their
hospitalizations from hospitals in that area”. There are 210 HSAs in California, and on average an HSA is
smaller than a county but much larger than a zip code. Table 1 Panel B presents summary statistics on this
sample. To be consistent with the RD-DD analysis, we exclude the 2008-2010 period. The resulting analysis
sample has 7.5 million and 40.3 million hospital stays and ER arrivals respectively.

OSHPD collects and publishes annual financial data on all hospitals in California. These reports

are mandated by California law and provide details on hospital finances, utilization and capital investments.
We use files covering 2011-16 in order to examine the effects of the insurance expansions on hospital
finances. The financial data is available for a smaller number of hospitals (about 320 instead of 370) since
Kaiser Permanente hospitals do not report their finances individually. 11 We make two transformations to

We obtained California population estimates for 2011-16 from National Cancer Institute/NIH. They generated these estimates
from population data provided by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). More information available at
https://seer.cancer.gov/popdata/singleages.html.
9 We follow Doyle et al. (2015) to define these conditions and create the sample. They list the 29 conditions used to define this
group in their Appendix table A1. We exclude Septicemia since there was a dramatic increase in patient volume under this
diagnosis during our sample period, with a near halving of mortality, suggesting that there was a change in how patients were
coded under Septicemia over this period.
10 HSAs were defined by the Dartmouth Atlas Project. There are roughly 210 HSAs in California, of which 79 and 34 are in the
LA and San Francisco metropolitan regions respectively. As comparison, there are 58 counties and approximately 1,800 zip codes.
11 Kaiser Permanente is the largest health maintenance organization (HMO) in the US and owns all its medical care facilities –
primary care, hospitals and post-acute care. Kaiser plan members are supposed to receive all medical care within this network.
Individual medical centers do not report financial results publicly. More details available at:

using the consumer price index for urban (CPI-U) consumers. Second, we normalize revenue, capital
spending and discharges by the hospital’s average number of licensed beds between 2008 and 2010 to
eliminate variation purely due to hospital size.

EFFECTS ON INSURANCE, UTILIZATION AND HEALTH
Empirical strategy
Consider a conceptual reduced form model of the effect of health insurance coverage on outcome

𝑌𝑌 as below:

𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽 ⋅ 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 + 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖

(1)

𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 denotes an outcome of interest (including utilization of care) for individual 𝑖𝑖 and 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 is an

indicator set to 1 if the individual has health insurance coverage and 0 otherwise. 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖 represents all

unobserved factors that affect outcome 𝑌𝑌. The key challenge in obtaining an unbiased estimate of the causal
effect 𝛽𝛽 is that individuals choose to purchase or enroll in health insurance coverage based at least partly

on private information about their health risk as well as their appetite for risk. 12 Appendix Table A. 1

illustrates this self-selection problem by presenting key attributes for insured and uninsured individuals at
age 21 (Panel A) and 65 (Panel B) using 2004-09 data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).
For example, insured young adults are much more likely to be in school and less likely to be married,
employed or smokers. Insured elderly are more likely to be married or employed, but less likely to be
smokers. The differences (Column 3) are both statistically significant and economically meaningful. These
individuals are likely to differ on important unobservable characteristics as well, implying that the required
condition 𝔼𝔼(𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖 |𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 ) = 0 will not be not satisfied.

Recent studies (Card et al., 2008; 2009; Anderson et al., 2012; 2014) have overcome this

endogeneity concern by exploiting the presence of age-based insurance eligibility restrictions and
discontinuities in coverage by using a fuzzy regression discontinuity framework. For example, in our setting
we can exploit the discontinuous change in insurance coverage that existed pre-ACA at age 65 to determine
the causal effect of insurance coverage using equations of the type shown below.
Insi = α10 + 𝜃𝜃1 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 + 𝜆𝜆11 (𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖 − 65) + 𝜆𝜆12 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 (𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖 − 65) + [𝑿𝑿′𝒊𝒊 𝜓𝜓1 +] ϵ1i

Yi = α20 + 𝜃𝜃2 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 + 𝜆𝜆12 (𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖 − 65) + 𝜆𝜆22 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 (𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖 − 65) + [𝑿𝑿′𝒊𝒊 𝜓𝜓2 +] ϵ2i

https://share.kaiserpermanente.org/article/fast-facts-about-kaiser-permanente/.
12 Other factors would surely influence this as well, including the price and quality of health insurance.

12

(2𝑎𝑎)

(2𝑏𝑏)

Equation 2a models insurance status for patient 𝑖𝑖 as a function of her age at arrival, 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖 and whether

she is younger than 65 (𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 = 1). Insurance status is assumed to vary linearly with age (through 𝜆𝜆11 ),
allowing for a different slope for individuals under the threshold (through 𝜆𝜆12 ). Equation 3b presents the

corresponding reduced form relationship between outcomes of interest (𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 ) such as utilization and age status
𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 . In both cases we may include additional patient controls 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 as needed. These equations would be

estimated using data from the pre-ACA period on patients aged close to 65. The fuzzy regression
discontinuity estimator of the causal effect of insurance coverage on outcome 𝑌𝑌 is then given by 𝛾𝛾𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 =
𝜃𝜃2 /𝜃𝜃1, and is equivalent to a local average treatment effect (LATE) estimator (Hahn et al., 2001).

However, the primary goal of this paper is to quantify insurance coverage changes caused by the

ACA as well as resulting effects on utilization of care and patient health. To do so, we build on the above
framework by exploiting the fact that the Medicaid expansion and introduction of the insurance exchange
led to dramatic changes in discontinuities in insurance coverage at ages 21 and 65. This setting therefore
lends itself to an RD differences-in-differences research design. Accordingly, we adapt the above estimating
equation as below:
Insit = α10 + δ1t + 𝜃𝜃11 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 + 𝜃𝜃12 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 ⋅ 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 + D′i Λ1 G(𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖 ) + [𝑿𝑿′𝒊𝒊 𝜓𝜓1 +] ϵ1it

(3𝑎𝑎′)

Equation 3a' represents the modified first stage equation. We now define 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 more generally in order to

accommodate both age thresholds of interest. In the case of the young it denotes those aged 21 or older,
while in the case of the elderly it denotes those aged 64 or younger.

𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 = �

1(𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖 ≥ 21) if young
1(𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖 < 65) if elderly

The indicator 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 = 1(𝑡𝑡 ≥ 2014) denotes whether the ACA has been implemented. The equation allows
insurance coverage to be modeled as a flexible function of age, using 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 and Λ1. 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖′ = [1 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 ] is a 1x2 vector

indicating patient-specific treatment status. Λ1 is a corresponding 2x𝑘𝑘 matrix of age coefficients to be

estimated, where 𝑘𝑘 is the order of the age polynomial, 𝐺𝐺. In our main results we use a linear polynomial in

age, i.e. 𝑘𝑘 = 1 so that the first stage and reduced form equations reduce to the following simple form.
Insit = α10 + δ1t + 𝜃𝜃11 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 + 𝜃𝜃12 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 ⋅ 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 + 𝜆𝜆11 𝑎𝑎�𝒊𝒊 + 𝜆𝜆12 𝑎𝑎�𝒊𝒊 ⋅ 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 + [𝑿𝑿′𝒊𝒊 𝜓𝜓1 +] ϵ1it

Yit = α20 + δ2t + 𝜃𝜃21 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 + 𝜃𝜃22 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 ⋅ 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 + 𝜆𝜆21 𝑎𝑎�𝒊𝒊 + 𝜆𝜆22 𝑎𝑎�𝒊𝒊 ⋅ 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 + [𝑿𝑿′𝒊𝒊 𝜓𝜓2 +] ϵ2it

13

(3𝑎𝑎)

(3𝑏𝑏)

We de-mean patient age relative to the benchmark (aged 21 or 65), which we denote 𝑎𝑎�𝒊𝒊 , and include

a full set of year fixed effects 𝛿𝛿𝑡𝑡 . For some outcomes we also include a vector of patient controls 𝑋𝑋𝒊𝒊 to

account for observable differences in patient sickness, such as arrival diagnosis category and gender. We
cluster standard errors by day-of-age cells (e.g. 65 and 2 days, 65 and 3 days and so on) to account for
possible correlated error terms among patients of the same day-of-age.
The coefficients of interest in this model are 𝜃𝜃12 and 𝜃𝜃22 and they estimate the average change in

the discontinuity at the threshold due to the ACA (i.e. post vs. pre). The causal effect of insurance on 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 i.e.

the RD-DD estimator, is given by 𝛾𝛾𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅,𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 = 𝜃𝜃22 /𝜃𝜃12 (Persson, 2017) and its identification relies on
stronger assumptions.

This strategy can be used to recover two types of estimators. The first estimator is the reduced form
change in insurance coverage, utilization or health caused by the ACA – quantified by 𝜃𝜃12 and 𝜃𝜃22 above.

Since these are similar to differences-in-differences estimators, the identification assumption is that in

absence of the ACA insurance expansions there would be no change to the discontinuity that existed preACA, i.e. 𝜃𝜃12 = 0 and 𝜃𝜃22 = 0. We present supporting evidence through a falsification exercise assuming

a placebo insurance expansion in 2010. We find little or no change on any outcome of interest between
2008-09 and 2010-11, providing reassuring evidence in support of this assumption.
To the extent that insurance coverage also changes for the control groups (ages 20 and 65) as a
result of the ACA, it is differenced out as a secular trend. Hence this approach will underestimate the
aggregate effects of the ACA. This is a pertinent concern in the case of young adults since Medicaid
coverage also increased substantially for 20-year-olds (see Figure 1a). For this reason, we focus our
discussion of results on the elderly group of patients. 13
The second estimator, 𝛾𝛾𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅,𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 is a derivative of the RD estimator, 𝛾𝛾𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 . As discussed in Lee and

Lemieux (2010), three assumptions enable a causal interpretation. First, relevant observable and
unobservable factors that could affect the outcomes of interest should vary smoothly at the age threshold.
For example, if individuals are disproportionately likely to graduate from college or enter employment
exactly at age 21 or exit the labor force exactly at age 65, this would violate the above assumption. Table
A. 1 column 5 presents population weighted estimates from the NHIS on discontinuities in school
enrollment, marital status, employment and a number of other factors at ages 21 (Panel A) and 65 (Panel
B). Column 4 presents mean values at the thresholds to serve as comparison. The evidence reassuringly
indicates there is no statistically significant jump in these factors – with the exception of alcohol

13 The ACA also implemented minor cuts to growth in Medicare payment rates and introduced performance pay incentives for
hospitals; hence, 65-year-old patients are not perfect ‘controls’. But these changes are minor relative to the Medicaid expansion
in California.

14

consumption which jumps at age 21. This may bias the RD estimator for young patients, a second reason
to focus on the elderly patient group.
The other two assumptions are common to all LATE estimators – exclusion of the instrument from
the outcome equation, and monotonicity (Angrist and Imbens, 1994). Together, they imply that the
estimated changes in utilization and health are only due to change in behavior by ‘compliers’, i.e. those
gaining insurance due to the ACA. Given the large-scale nature of changes wrought by the ACA, supply
side factors (i.e. changes in treatment or outreach by hospitals and physicians) or spillover effects on inframarginal individuals (e. g. individuals already eligible for Medicaid) may contribute substantially to the
observed changes in outcomes. Exclusion restrictions are generally strong, and in this setting they may be
untenable given the substantial changes in the health insurance landscape. Hence we focus our presentation
of results to the reduced form estimates.
B.

Insurance coverage
We begin by analyzing changes in insurance coverage for patients discharged from hospitals in

California’s hospitals using data from 2011 through 2016, acknowledging that changes in insurance may
have caused a change in utilization of care and who gets hospitalized. We explore that possibility in section
IV.C.
i.

Changes in insurance post-ACA
Figure 2 plots observed and predicted changes in insurance coverage in 2014-16 relative to 2011-

13 (circles, solid lines) for the elderly (Panel A) and young (Panel B) respectively. The predicted values
were obtained by estimating equation 3a on case level data, although for presentation clarity we collapse
the data to month-of-age. 14 In both patient groups, insurance coverage increases differentially for the treated
patient sample (i.e. 64- and 21-year-olds) post-ACA. The differential increase is much larger among the
young (~14 percentage points) as compared to the elderly (6 pp). One approach to interpret the magnitude
of this change in coverage is to compare it in magnitude to the pre-ACA gap in coverage between the treated
and ‘control’ patient groups, since 21- and 64-year-olds have historically been at an insurance disadvantage
relative to their counterparts aged 20 and 65, respectively. The pre-ACA gap was 15 pp and 7 pp
respectively for the young and elderly (not presented in the figure). Hence the ACA nearly eliminated the
disparity in health insurance coverage at these two age thresholds (also suggested by the patterns in Figure
1b).

We use regression coefficients from equation 3a to predict the probability of insurance coverage for each patient. We then
collapse these predicted probabilities by taking the mean across all patients admitted with the same month-of-age. For both
predicted and observed values, we calculate differences between the pre-ACA and post-ACA period in each month-of-age cell.
The figures plot these aggregated predicted – and corresponding observed – values.
14

15

Figure 2 also presents – as a falsification exercise – the corresponding observed and predicted
changes in insurance coverage over 2010-11 relative to 2008-09 (squares, dashed lines). The estimated
magnitude is an order of magnitude smaller, and of the opposite sign: -0.6 pp. In addition to being minor,
this estimate implies a differential pre-trend of decreasing insurance coverage among those aged 64, which
would work against our finding an increase in insurance coverage post-ACA. There is a similar pattern in
the case of the younger patients.
Since 20-year-olds experienced a substantial increase in coverage of about 6 pp, they are not an
ideal control group. Our research design recovers the incremental effects of the ACA for 21-year-olds and
will understate the aggregate effect. In contrast, there was no change in insurance coverage for 65-yearolds. Hence, for the remainder of the RD analysis we will focus on results for our sample of elderly (i.e.
aged 64-65) patients, while results on the younger patients (aged 20-21) are mostly relegated to the
appendix.
Appendix Figure A. 4 presents a disaggregated version of Figure 2 by plotting corresponding
changes for different insurer types – Medicaid, Private, Self-pay and County indigent care. We do not
present the change in Medicare and miscellaneous coverage types since there is essentially none. The
appendix figure indicates that Medicaid expansion drove the increase in insurance since Medicaid is the
only source of increase in coverage for elderly patients. This figure also suggests that the increase in
Medicaid may be at least partially offset by a decrease in other existing types of health insurance coverage.
We discuss these changes and implications for crowd-out next.
ii.

Crowd-out
An important policy concern associated with the expansion of publicly funded insurance is the

potential crowd-out of existing payers. Our research design allows us to identify crowd-out of existing
insurers among hospitalized individuals in California. Table 2 presents formal estimates of changes in
insurance coverage at the two age thresholds for patients discharged from hospital stays, obtained by
estimating equation 3a on case level data. Panels A and B present results for the elderly and young
respectively. Within each panel, the top row presents the average change in coverage post-ACA for 64-

year-olds relative to 65-year-olds (𝜃𝜃12 ), while the remaining rows present flexibly estimated effects for

each post-ACA year. Columns 1-3 present results on Medicaid, Private and Miscellaneous insurance types.
Column 4 presents results on aggregate coverage, while columns 5 and 6 present results on self-pay and the
county indigent program.
Table 2 Panel A has two key implications. First, overall coverage for the elderly increased less than
the increase in Medicaid (5.9 pp vs. 8.7 pp). This is mainly due to a 2.6 pp decrease in private coverage.
Second, the decline in self-pay is about 30 percent the size of the increase in Medicaid (2.6 pp vs. 8.7 pp).

In fact, there is a larger decline in the county indigent program (3.3 pp or 40% of the Medicaid expansion)
16

than in self-pay. Post-ACA, the county indigent program shrinks to nearly zero. The remaining 30% of the
Medicaid expansion is offset by the decline in private insurance. The dynamic results indicate that insurance
coverage increased gradually between 2014 and 2016, with about 85% of the average gain (7.4 vs. 8.7)
obtained in the first year. Hence these results may understate the long-term effects of the expansion.
The results above permit two observations. First, the Medicaid expansion drove the increase in
health insurance coverage. The ACA exchange enrollments apparently did not lead to a net increase of
private coverage among elderly hospitalized patients. 15 When we discuss the effects on utilization and
health, we will interpret them as primarily occurring due to the Medicaid expansion.
Second, the near demise of local safety net programs implies that a substantial share of the Medicaid
expansion replaced existing state and county spending on health care. Extrapolating directly from our
estimate above (40% of increase in Medicaid replaced county coverage) implies that for every $100 increase
in Medicaid hospital spending, about $40 replaced safety net spending. This naïve interpretation ignores
differences in patient severity and reimbursement rates between Medicaid and the safety net program.
However, the reimbursement rates were in fact quite different. Financial data reported by hospitals to
California indicates that in 2011-13 hospitals were reimbursed at half the rate for county indigent patients
as for Medicaid patients ($1,240 vs. $2,400 per day). 16 Hence the $40 transfer from federal tax payers that
fully funded the Medicaid expansion is about equally split between hospitals that now receive greater
reimbursement rates, and California and county governments that largely funded the local safety net. There
are distributional implications as well – if we ignore differences in the costs of raising taxes at different
levels of government, this transfer was borne by federal taxpayers outside California, including those
residing in states that chose to not expand Medicaid. We return to implications for hospitals in section VI
when we examine effects on hospital finances.

i.

Utilization of care
Volume
Since our data is conditional on discharge from a hospital, we cannot study the rate of hospital use

at the individual level (since for example many individuals are not hospitalized during our study period).
We use hospital stays or ER arrivals per 1,000 people per year (i.e. the utilization rate) as our preferred
measure. We collapse the data to day-of-age at admission (denoted by 𝑠𝑠) - year cells and estimate the

following model.
15

The data does not allow us to differentiate between exchange and non-exchange plans. It is possible that exchange plans did
cause an increase in private insurance coverage. If true, this was apparently more than offset by a crowd-out of other type of private
coverage.
16 In 2016 dollars. A caveat is that these numbers are for patients of all ages and include maternity stays. Both Medicaid and the
county indigent programs require small or no co-payment so the effective price on the demand side is not different for the two
programs.

(4)

This is an exact analog of equation 3b, which was estimated on case level data. 𝑦𝑦𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 and 𝑎𝑎�𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 denote the mean

utilization rate and de-meaned age of patients in the day-of-age - year cell 𝑠𝑠, 𝑡𝑡. 𝑑𝑑𝑠𝑠 is the corresponding

indicator obtained by collapsing 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 within each day-of-age cell. The coefficient of interest is 𝜃𝜃32 – the

estimated change in the discontinuity in the rate of utilizing hospital care post-ACA for the treated group
relative to the control.
Figure 3 presents the observed change in the rate of utilization post-ACA of hospital stays (Panel

A) and ER arrivals (Panel B) for elderly patients, by month of age. In addition, we plot fitted values obtained
by estimating equation 4. Panel A shows that there has been a decline in the rate of hospitalization for both

64- and 65-year-old patients, with a smaller decline for the treated group, and a noticeable drop exactly at
age 65. Panel B shows on the other hand that there has been an increase in the rate of ER use for both
groups, with a greater increase for 64-year-olds.
Table 3 presents estimated effects on utilization of care for elderly patients, obtained using equation
4. Table 3 column 1 presents results for all hospital stays. Columns 2 and 3 examine effects separately for
hospital stays that originated through the ER and those that did not since they may respond differently to
changes in insurance coverage. Similarly, columns 4 and 5 present results separately for deferrable and
non-deferrable hospital stays. The table presents both average post-ACA effects (top row) and dynamic
effects for each year 2014-16. We find a differential increase among 64-year-olds of 6% of the mean (8
stays per 1,000 people per year), which eliminates 40% of the pre-ACA gap in hospital stays between 64and 65-year-olds. The estimates indicate that much of the increase is driven by stays for elective or nonemergent reasons. For example, 85% of the increase is driven by more stays for deferrable conditions, and
60% by stays that did not originate in the ER. Table 3 columns 6 and 7 present corresponding results on
ER use. We present results on all patients arriving at the ER (column 6), as well as those that were
discharged from the ER (column 7). The pattern of increase in ER use is similar to that of hospital stays,
whether benchmarking it as a percentage of the mean level or against the pre-ACA gap between 64- and
65-year-olds. Across hospital stays and ER arrivals, the ACA resulted in an increase in utilization rate that
bridged about 35-40% of the pre-ACA gap in volume between 64- and 65-year-olds. 17

17

Our reduced form estimates are similar in magnitude to those reported by Card et al. (2008). They examined the effects of the
onset of Medicare coverage at age 65 on utilization of care and insurance coverage, using data from California, Florida and New
York. They find an 8 percent increase in the rate of hospitalization at age 65, while we find a 6% increase post-ACA. They estimated
an increase of 5% and 14% in stays originating in ER vs. not, while our corresponding estimates are 3% and 10% respectively. We
also estimated alternative specifications 1) using log of utilization rate as outcome, and 2) in the spirit of a regression kink i.e.
allowing the effect to increase with exposure to the ACA (based on age and time since 2014). These results are qualitatively similar
and are available on request.

18

The hospitalization rate for 64-year-olds pre-ACA was about 0.13 stays per individual per year.
Our estimate implies this rate increased by 6% (~0.008) post-ACA. If it is driven entirely by the 6 percent
who acquired coverage due to the ACA then it implies an increase of 0.13 (0.008/0.06) stays i.e. a doubling
of utilization for marginal individuals. This effect is three times the comparable estimate from the Oregon
experiment (Finkelstein et al., 2012). They report a LATE estimate of a 30% increase (Table A.26) for nearelderly individuals (aged 50-63) due to Medicaid coverage. It is possible that the newly insured individuals
are sicker than existing Medicaid patients and hence need to consume more hospital care. Perhaps more
importantly, our estimated increase may be driven by general equilibrium effects. For example, hospitals
and physicians may have responded to the much publicized Medicaid expansion and increased
reimbursement rate by expanding access to and increasing treatment intensity for low-income non-elderly
patients.
ii.

Choice of hospital
In addition to increasing hospital care, patients may also be receiving care at different types of

hospitals after the Medicaid expansion. We explore hospital choice on two dimensions – ownership type
(e.g. public, private non-profit, and private for-profit) and quality (as measured by risk adjusted mortality
and readmission scores). A key benefit of expanding insurance could be enabling patients to choose higher
quality care providers or providers that patients prefer for other reasons (e.g. proximity).
a.

Hospital owner type
Figure 4a presents the change in the observed share of stays at government hospitals for elderly

patients post ACA. It also presents the corresponding fitted values obtained by estimating equation 3b on
case level data. Figure 4a indicates that patient volume shifted away marginally from government owned

hospitals (~1.1 pp) post-ACA. The discontinuity in the share of government owned hospitals is more diffuse
than those in insurance coverage and volume, but the patterns for 64- and 65-year-olds are clearly different,
with a larger reduction in government share among 64-year-olds, whose coverage differentially increased.
Table 4 columns 1-3 present estimated effects on hospital share by owner type for elderly patients.
Panel A presents results for hospital stays, while Panel B presents results on ER arrivals. The table confirms
the trends shown by the plot, and suggests that for-profit hospitals gained about 70% of this shift in volume,
although by 2016 both non-profits and for-profits benefit about equally. Note that 64-year-olds were more
likely to receive care at government owned hospitals in the pre-ACA period. This shift from public to
private hospitals among 64-year-olds after the ACA narrows the pre-ACA gap between 64- and 65-yearolds by 60%, but does not eliminate it.
Our research design cannot help us disentangle the mechanisms – specifically supply vs. demand
side channels – behind this shift in hospital care toward private hospitals. Assuming Medicare patients are
unconstrained in their hospital choices, the lower share of government hospitals among 65-year-olds
19

indicates patient preference for private hospitals. Hence, the most intuitive explanation for narrowing this
gap post-ACA is that it is demand driven. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that private hospitals
proactively courted ACA beneficiaries (such as exchange enrollees and Medicaid beneficiaries). To inform
our interpretation, we replicate the analysis on the sample of ER arrivals (Table 4b). ER arrival patterns are
more likely to reflect patient preferences since they are presumably for emergencies and hence there is less
scope for physician influence. 18 We find a similar pattern of movement away from government owned
hospitals among ER arrivals. In fact, the shift is greater in percentage terms (11% vs. 7% for hospital stays)
among ER users. Taken together, these results suggest that the differential drop in the utilization of care in
public hospitals among 64-year-olds reflects the greater choice afforded by formal health insurance
coverage.
b.

Hospital quality
Hospital ownership is correlated with quality or with perceived quality of care (for example,

academic medical centers are generally high quality and non-profit), but not perfectly so. To examine if the
above sorting across hospitals is motivated by quality, we use two commonly accepted quality measures –
risk-adjusted 30-day mortality and readmission rates – as indicators of hospital quality. We test if patient
volume has shifted toward hospitals that were publicly certified by CMS in 2009 as having better quality
outcomes.
CMS calculates these measures for Medicare patients discharged from hospitals for a number of
serious conditions. The raw mortality and readmission rates are adjusted for patient risk history and
observed sickness at the time of admission. 19 We start with the risk-adjusted rates for hospitals, as reported
by CMS in 2009, on three conditions: heart attack, heart failure and pneumonia. We then compute the mean
rate for each hospital and normalize it such that the distribution across hospitals is standard normal with a
mean of 0 and standard deviation of 100.
Figure 4b presents the observed mean normalized mortality scores and corresponding fitted values
obtained by estimating equation 3b on the Y-axis, against patient month-of-age on the X-axis. The plot is

admittedly diffuse, without a clear discontinuity at age 65. The fitted values indicate that mean hospital
mortality score increased for 65-year-old patients, while it held relatively constant for 64-year-olds,
resulting in a relative improvement of about 2 pp. We do not present the corresponding plot for mean
readmission scores since the estimated change is not statistically significant – although the point estimate
is negative – and the plot is even more diffuse.
18 We also directly examined if 64-year-old patients are receiving care at hospitals located closer to them, however we did not
find any consistent patterns. We used distance between the patient’s and hospital’s zip codes, provided by NBER. These results
are available on request.
19
More details on the methodology are available at https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-AssessmentInstruments/HospitalQualityInits/OutcomeMeasures.html. The mortality measures are available at
https://data.medicare.gov/data/hospital-compare.

20

Table 4 columns 4 and 5 present the formal estimated effects on mean mortality and readmission
scores respectively. Panels A and B present the results for hospital stays and ER arrivals respectively. The
results are similar across both panels and indicate that patient volume among 64-year-olds has shifted
toward marginally better-quality hospitals. In the pre-ACA period, 64-year-olds received care at lower
quality hospitals (0.04 s. d. higher mortality rate) relative to 65-year-olds. The estimated effects for hospital
stays indicate that the pre-ACA disparity between 64- and 65-year-olds decreased by about half. As an
additional test, we also obtained alternative estimates where the specification controls for hospital owner
type. The coefficients drop in magnitude by about half but remain statistically significant in the case of
mortality. We interpret this to mean patients are sorting toward better-quality hospitals even within the same
hospital owner type, and this contributes 50% of the observed improvement in hospital quality.
To interpret the magnitude of this change we use revealed preference estimates of the additional
distance patients are willing to travel to receive care at better hospitals. There is a large literature on hospital
choice which has developed approaches to estimate these parameters and a full review is outside of the
scope of this paper, but the most relevant reference is Tay (2003) who examines Medicare data from
California, Oregon and Washington. She finds that younger, white, male heart attack patients are willing to
travel up to 8 miles further to receive care at a hospital with a 3% lower mortality rate. Our results imply
that 64-year-olds are now receiving care at hospitals with a 0.03 pp (0.02 s. d. i.e. 2% of 1.6 pp, not reported
here) lower mortality rate, or approximately 0.3% of the mean 30-day mortality rate for heart attack patients
(~10 pp). Crudely applying the 8-mile benchmark suggests that the average 64-year-old hospital patient is
benefitting by the equivalent of a ~1 mile (0.3/3*8) reduction in travel distance.

Health Outcomes
Well-designed field experiments have indicated no tangible benefits of insurance coverage on

patient health (Manning et al., 1987; Finkelstein et al., 2012). However, some studies on the effects of
Medicaid have found mortality benefits, albeit among children (Currie & Gruber, 1996a; Bailey &
Goodman-Bacon, 2015; Goodman-Bacon, 2018). Similarly, evidence from the recent Massachusetts
insurance reform indicates substantial mortality benefits of expanding coverage for low income individuals
(Sommers, Long and Baicker, 2014). The ACA was designed to explicitly extend insurance coverage for
non-elderly adults – a group that has historically received less attention. In this section we test the effects
of the ACA on patient mortality, specifically in-hospital mortality – the largest component of 30-day
mortality. 20
20

Due to data limitations, we do not observe 30-day mortality post ACA. We obtained death-linked hospital discharge files over
2008-11 from California OSHPD to examine the link between in-hospital mortality standard metrics of mortality. OSHPD creates
these files by linking hospital discharge records with the state death register. Hence, we can observe standard short-term mortality
outcomes like 7-day and 30-day mortality through November 2011. We find that in-hospital deaths accounted for 79% and 64% of

21

Appendix Table A. 2 columns 1 and 2 present regression estimates on in-hospital mortality for
elderly patients obtained by estimating equation 3b. Panels A and B present results for hospital stays and

ER arrivals respectively. Due to the increase in hospital use, there is a concern that unobserved decrease in
patient severity may lead to spuriously estimating a decrease in mortality. Prior studies (Card et al., 2009;

Doyle et al., 2015) have circumvented this concern by focusing on the subset of patients discharged with
emergent non-deferrable conditions such as Heart Attack and Pneumonia, where outpatient treatment is not
possible. We follow the same approach and these results are presented in column 2. The point estimate of
the effect on in-hospital mortality is a statistically insignificant -0.29 pp, about 7% of the mean mortality
rate in the sample. Prior to the ACA, 64-year-old patients had a higher in-hospital mortality rate (a
statistically insignificant 0.35 pp difference), and this result suggests that this gap has been almost entirely
eliminated. Though the estimate is noisy, we can rule out an effect greater than 10% of the pre-ACA mean
mortality rate. We therefore interpret the suggestive evidence on mortality with caution and refrain from a
formal cost-benefit computation.
A key argument used in favor of expanding insurance coverage was that greater immediate access
to preventative care would circumvent later wasteful use of expensive ER/hospital care. Hence, a natural
second outcome of interest to measure patient health is whether the ACA led to a decrease in the wasteful
use of hospital care. Potentially avoidable episodes are identified for a subset of visits based on ICD-9
diagnosis codes recorded in a patient’s discharge data and have previously been used for this purpose
(Kolstad and Kowalski, 2012). 21 Table A. 2 column 4 presents corresponding estimated effects on the share
of stays that were potentially avoidable. The coefficients are very small and statistically insignificant,
suggesting there is no change. This is consistent with prior evidence from Tennessee showing that a
contraction of Medicaid did not increase the share of uninsured stays for avoidable reasons (Ghosh and
Simon, 2015).

Robustness and falsification checks
Alternate specification
Our preferred specification allows the slope with respect to age to differ for treatment and control

groups but constrains the slopes to remain unchanged in the post-period. In this sub-section we test
robustness to relaxing this constraint. Appendix Table A. 3 presents corresponding results on all key
outcomes – changes in insurance coverage (columns 1-5), utilization (cols. 6-7), hospital choice (cols. 8-9)

7-day and 30-day mortality respectively for patients in these age groups. In-hospital death is also highly predictive of 30-day
mortality across hospitals, with an R-squared of over 0.9.
21
Potentially avoidable care hospitalization is defined only for hospital care where the primary diagnosis code pertains to a
condition of the endocrine, nervous, circulatory, respiratory, digestive or ill-defined systems. These categories account for about
55% of the total sample of elderly patients in 2011-16 respectively.

22

and patient health (cols. 10-11). To facilitate comparison, Panel A repeats our main results. Panel B presents
results using a fully flexible specification that also allows the slopes with respect to age to change in the
post period, holding the bandwidth at 1-year around the benchmark age of 65. We present coefficients on
the relative change in the pre-ACA gap between 64- and 65-year-olds post-ACA, as in our main results.
The results exhibit qualitatively similar patterns and most have only minor differences in point
estimates. The exceptions are a substantially larger estimated increase in ER arrivals in column (7) and
smaller magnitude estimates on hospital choice in columns (8) and (9). Additionally, we performed another
specification check modeling outcomes as quadratic functions of age and found similar point estimates.
ii.

Alternate bandwidth
We prefer one year as the narrowest feasible bandwidth to implement the RD-DD design.
However, we test robustness to other choices by replicating results using a larger bandwidth of two years
instead. Appendix Table A. 3 presents corresponding results of this robustness check for all key outcomes.
In Panel C, we continue to use our main specification, but with a 2-year bandwidth. Panel D presents results
in which we use both the flexible specification and a 2-year bandwidth. 22 The results indicate minor
differences in point estimates, but qualitatively similar patterns. Taken together, the results are reassuringly
robust regardless of specification or bandwidth.

iii.

Falsification
A valid identification concern is that the results may be partially or fully driven by pre-existing
economic trends that may differentially affect 64-year-old patients. This is particularly relevant in the case
of the estimated decrease in private coverage, which is a larger trend observed in health care data since the
Great recession. To investigate this possibility, we replicated our regression discontinuity analysis over the
period 2008-11 i.e. before the ACA insurance expansions were implemented. Ideally, if our pre-ACA
coefficient (2011-13) estimates a stable discontinuity in coverage, then we should find similar estimates in
08−11
11−16
the 2008-09 period as well, i.e. 𝜃𝜃11
= 𝜃𝜃11
. If the post-ACA coefficient captures changes only due
08−11
to the ACA, then we would find a zero (or very small) effect in the placebo analysis, i.e. 𝜃𝜃12
≈ 0.

Table 5 presents results from the placebo analysis on insurance coverage, utilization, hospital

choice and patient health for hospital stays. It summarizes effects on key outcomes from Table 2, Table 3,
and Table 4. The top row presents the estimated difference between 64- and 65-year-olds over 2008-09 i.e.
08−11
08−11
𝜃𝜃11
from equation 3a/3b while the second row presents the change in this gap post 2010, i.e. 𝜃𝜃12
.

The placebo coefficients for post 2010 change are not significantly different from zero or are very small in
magnitude. Overall, the pattern of results does not mimic the post-ACA results. For example, we find an
increase in self-pay, no change in the rate of hospitalizations or the share of government hospitals. There is
22 Again, the use of a quadratic specification does not affect coefficients with a 2-year bandwidth and these results are virtually
identical to those in Panel C. Results using quadratic specification are available upon request.

23

a small increase in Medicaid of 0.75 pp, and a decrease in private coverage of similar magnitude, which
may be due to the ‘early’ Medicaid expansion implemented in California in 2011 (Golberstein et al., 2015;
Sommers et al., 2015; Wherry and Miller, 2016). Nevertheless, these coefficients are very small relative to
the effects obtained after the full expansion took effect in January 2014.

V.
A.

ALL NON-ELDERLY ADULTS
Empirical strategy
We consider the RD-DD design our preferred approach, but its external validity is limited. The RD-

DD estimates are mainly representative of effects for individuals just below age 65 relative to those at age
65. Additionally, patients aged 64-65 are less than 10% of the size of the non-elderly patient sample. We
therefore supplement the RD-DD analysis above using an alternative approach that takes advantage of the
entire non-elderly (21-64) sample and relies on variation across hospital service areas (HSAs), a commonly
used hospital market definition discussed in section III.B.
The ACA was designed to increase insurance coverage among lower income families and
individuals. In 2012, the uninsurance rate among California adults aged 19-64 with income below the 138%
of the federal poverty level was 36%, in contrast to 15% for those above (Charles et al., 2017). Markets
with lower average income levels therefore had higher rates of uninsurance prior to the ACA and would
experience greater decrease in uninsurance due to the ACA. Our thought experiment predicts that such
HSAs would experience a greater “insurance expansion shock” than markets with lower poverty.
We deploy a differences-in-differences research design exploiting cross-sectional variation in
poverty rates (the share of the population below 125% of the federal poverty level) across HSAs in 200711. We use data from the ACS 2007-11 5-year estimates to calculate the poverty variation just prior to the
ACA. Figure 5 presents a histogram of the estimated poverty rates among non-elderly adults across HSAs.
There is substantial variation in poverty – the difference in poverty between the top and bottom quintile
markets was 18%, coincidentally similar to the mean poverty level. In addition, we leverage within-HSA
time-series variation created due to the implementation of the ACA in 2014. We estimate econometric
models at the HSA-year level, presented in equation 5a.

𝑌𝑌𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗 + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 + 𝜉𝜉 ⋅ 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗 ⋅ 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 + [𝑿𝑿′𝒋𝒋𝒋𝒋 𝜓𝜓+] 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

(5𝑎𝑎)

𝑌𝑌𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is the mean outcome value for HSA 𝑗𝑗 in year 𝑡𝑡. 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 is an indicator for years 2014 and later. The

coefficient of interest is 𝜉𝜉 which estimates the change in outcome 𝑌𝑌 post-ACA (2014-16) versus pre-ACA

(2011-13) for a market with baseline poverty rate of one compared to a market with no poverty. We

24

maintain the sample period 2011-16 in order to be consistent with the RD-DD analysis. We include a full
set of HSA and year fixed effects, 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗 and 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 , respectively. Some specifications account for observable

differences in patient characteristics (age group, gender, and category of principal diagnosis) by including
vector 𝑿𝑿𝒋𝒋𝒋𝒋 . To mitigate the influence of small outlier units, we weight each HSA by pre-ACA non-elderly
population estimates obtained from the same source as the poverty shares.

Identification of the causal effect of the ACA relies on the standard parallel trends assumption, i.e.
outcomes for HSA markets at different poverty levels would evolve along similar paths in absence of the
ACA. To test the presence of possible differential pre-trends across markets, we estimate and present results
from models allowing effects 𝜉𝜉𝑠𝑠 to vary flexibly by year from 2011 through 2016, omitting 2013 as the

reference year, as depicted in equation 5b.
Y𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = αj + γt +

𝑠𝑠=2016

� 𝜉𝜉𝑠𝑠 ⋅ Poverty ratej ⋅ I(t = s) + ϵ𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗

𝑠𝑠=2011,
≠2013

(5𝑏𝑏)

Note that this approach uses a different source of identifying variation relative to the regression
discontinuity analysis. Estimates from the geographic analysis inform us about changes for patients residing
in high poverty areas relative to changes for patients in affluent markets. To the extent that affluent markets
also experienced changes, these will be differenced out. For example, Medicaid coverage for patients in the
most affluent quintile of HSAs nearly doubled from 13% to 25% (a 12 pp increase) post-ACA. However,
Medicaid coverage for the least affluent quintile increased by an even larger margin – 18 pp. This research
design is designed to model only the net widening of the gap (by 6 pp) between the two groups of markets.
As with the RD-DD analysis, this approach may therefore understate the aggregate effects of the ACA.
In the interest of brevity, we summarize regression results obtained using this approach into two
tables. Table 6 presents the results on insurance coverage and volume of care, while Table 7 presents
corresponding results on hospital choice and patient health. In both tables panel A presents the average
post-ACA effect, while Panel B presents flexibly estimated effects for each year from 2011 through 2016
relative to 2013.
B.

Insurance coverage
Table 6 columns 1-6 present results on changes in insurance coverage. These results lead to similar

conclusions as in the RD-DD approach. First, there was a large increase in insurance coverage, driven
primarily by Medicaid. The mean poverty rate in the pre-ACA period was 18%, hence the coefficient of 29
implies an average increase in Medicaid coverage of 5.2 percentage points (29*0.18). Correspondingly, the
results imply an average increase of 4.8 pp in insurance coverage (26.4*0.18), which would entirely

25

eliminate the pre-ACA disparity in coverage between the least and most affluent market quintiles (-4.7 pp).
In contrast, we estimate a small and statistically insignificant increase in private coverage, implying an
increase of 0.6 percentage points (3.4*0.18) on average. In fact, we can rule out an increase of greater than
1.5 pp (8*0.18) in private coverage, which would make a negligible difference to the 30 pp gap in private
coverage between the least and most affluent market quintiles. Nevertheless, this result moderates the
takeaway from the RD-DD results that the Medicaid expansion crowded out private payers.23
Second, the decline in self-pay is less than half the increase in Medicaid coverage (~2.5 pp). It is
still sufficient to eliminate the disparity in self pay between the least and most affluent markets (~2 pp).
About 40% of the increase in Medicaid offsets the decline of county indigent programs, strikingly similar
to the estimate in the RD-DD approach. Figure 6a presents the event study plot of changes in insurance
coverage, using estimates from equation 5b. It clearly shows that the increase in Medicaid coverage is about
twice as large as the corresponding decrease in self-pay status, and also there were no differential pre-trends
across markets.

C.

Utilization (volume and hospital choice)
Table 6 columns 7-10 present the estimated effects on hospital volume (in logs). Unlike in the RD-

DD analysis, we are unable to normalize the raw discharges by HSA-year population estimates since we do
not have annual estimates of population by HSA. However the concern of spurious results due to the baby
boom is diminished in this case since the annual variation in age profile across markets is likely very small
relative to the variation in baseline poverty across markets. The estimates in Panel A imply that hospital
utilization by non-elderly patients increased by ~4% across hospital stays (Col. 7) and ER arrivals (Col. 10)
on average (0.2*0.18, 0.25*0.18). Columns 8 and 9 present results separately for deferrable and nondeferrable stays and intuitively show that the increase in stays is driven mainly by patients who came in
with deferrable conditions. This is qualitatively similar to the estimates from the RD-DD approach and
suggest that 64-year-olds experienced an increase in utilization that was only slightly greater than that for
all non-elderly adults (6% vs. 4%). Figure 6b presents the corresponding event study plot and indicates a
sharp increase in volume in 2014, followed by further increases in subsequent years. The plot suggests no
differential trends in utilization across markets prior to the ACA.
The implied increase in hospital volume of 4-6% across both our age-based RD-DD and
geographic-based empirical approaches agrees well with observed changes in utilization for non-elderly
adults over this period. Appendix Figure A. 5 presents the time series of hospital stays and ER arrivals

23

It is possible that crowd-out was greater among 64-year-olds than among all 21-64-year-olds since their average health care costs
are much greater and so there would be more for employers (and possibly employees if any savings were passed on through wages)
to gain from dropping coverage for this group than for their much younger counterparts.

26

(right axis) for patients aged 21-64. The period spans 2011-16, our analysis period. Raw discharges have
been normalized by estimated population in this age group by year, so the plot presents utilization rate per
1,000 individuals per year. Consider the case of hospital stays – simply extrapolating the 2011-13 values
using a linear trend would predict about 50 stays per 1,000 people in 2016. The observed rate exceeds this
prediction by about 3.5 stays per 1,000 people, or 6% of the mean rate over 2011-13 (56.3). If we use the
raw discharge volume changes instead, we obtain an observed increase of 5.5%. Similar analysis holds for
the ER arrivals.
Table 7 columns 1-3 present corresponding results on changes in hospital shares post-ACA. We
examine the change in share by hospital owner type (columns 1-2) and mean risk adjusted mortality score
(Col. 3). Although the point estimates are qualitatively in the same direction as the results from the RD-DD
analysis, they are smaller in magnitude (e.g. implied decrease in government hospital share is 0.6 pp relative
to 1 pp in Table 4 column 1 Panel A) and we cannot rule out effects in either direction. Figure 6c presents
the corresponding event study plot on share of hospital stays at private hospitals. It shows a slight increase
post-ACA, with an increasing trend. The estimated effect on hospital quality (Col. 3) is particularly noisy.
Overall, these results indicate heterogeneity across patients in different age groups, where the sharply
estimated effects for 64-year-olds may not be representative of the trend for the entire non-elderly sample.

D.

Health
Table 7 columns 4 and 5 present estimated effects on in-hospital mortality for the non-elderly

patient group. Again, we primarily focus on effects for the subset of patients discharged with a nondeferrable condition (Col. 5). The results are suggestive of mortality gains, though the point estimate is not
statistically significant, as in the RD-DD analysis. The estimate implies an average decrease in mortality of
0.14 pp (0.77*0.18), sufficient to eliminate a quarter of the pre-ACA mortality gap between the poorest and
most affluent market quintiles (0.48 pp).

VI.

HOSPITAL FINANCES
In this section, we have three goals. First, we document changes in hospital revenue due to the

ACA and discuss heterogeneity in effects across hospitals based on their baseline patient mix. Government
owned hospitals disproportionately served safety net and self-pay patients pre-ACA, and so the expansion
would have a greater impact on them. Second, we quantify the proportion of the revenue increase that can
be linked directly to increases in patient volume versus increases in prices. Medicaid reimbursed hospitals
for inpatient stays and outpatient visits at about twice the rate that they received from self-paying patients

27

and county indigent programs. 24 Hence, a substitution to Medicaid from these other sources of coverage
theoretically should lead to an increase in average reimbursement rates. Our results on hospital volume in
the previous two sections indicated a 4-6% increase in volume of hospital care on average. However, it may
vary when we examine at the hospital level, since there was some reallocation of patients away from
government hospitals. Third, we test if the influx of public insurer funds spurred capital investment and
expansion by hospitals.

A.

Empirical strategy
We implement a differences-in-differences research design which uses cross-sectional variation in

pre-ACA uninsurance rates across hospitals. The thought experiment is conceptually similar to that used in
the geographic analysis where hospitals with a high pre-ACA share of uninsured patients would experience
a greater insurance shock relative to hospitals that largely served insured patients. Figure 7 illustrates the
magnitude of this variation across hospitals before and after the ACA. Panel A presents a histogram of
hospital uninsurance shares pre-ACA, 2008-10, calculated using hospital discharge data. Most hospitals
ranged between zero to approximately 30%. Hospitals in the top quintile by uninsurance had 20 percentage
point greater baseline uninsurance than hospitals in the bottom quintile. Panel B presents the distribution
after the implementation of the ACA, 2014-16. The range noticeably shrank, with most hospitals now below
15%.
Equation 6a presents the estimating equation for this approach. We deploy annual data on hospital

finances collected by OSHPD over the period 2011 to 2016, as described in section III.C, and

correspondingly perform this analysis at the hospital-year level. To mitigate the influence of small outlier
units, we weight each hospital observation by the number of pre-ACA discharges in 2008-10.
𝑌𝑌ℎ𝑡𝑡 = 𝛼𝛼ℎ + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 + 𝜒𝜒 ⋅ Uninsuredℎ−0810 ⋅ 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 + 𝜖𝜖ℎ𝑡𝑡

(6𝑎𝑎)

The key identification assumption is the absence of differential pre-trends in finances across
hospitals at different levels of baseline patient uninsurance shares. In order to test for the presence of pretrends, we also estimate the flexible dynamic specification 6b. Note that this analysis quantifies effects of
the ACA insurance expansion net of patient sorting across hospitals.

24 Surprisingly, hospitals received similar reimbursement from self-pay customers, as from those covered by county indigent
programs. This is consistent with the finding by Gruber and Rodriguez (2007) that providers are able to recover similar or more
revenue from self-paying patients.

To estimate differences across hospital types we also estimate a differences-in-differences-indifferences model in equation 6c where we interact an indicator for being a government hospital, 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺ℎ ,

with Uninsuredℎ−0810 ⋅ 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 and the year fixed effects 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 . The latter flexibly allows government hospitals to

Hospital revenue
Table 8 Columns 1-6 present results on revenue, expressed in thousands of dollars per bed from

estimating these equations. We present results on total revenue as well as from different payers (Medicaid
– including managed care, Private, and all others) and types of services (inpatient vs. outpatient). All
revenue variables are deflated to be in 2016 dollars (in thousands) using the CPI-U and normalized by the
hospital’s average number of licensed beds in the baseline period. 26 Panel A presents results from estimating
equation 6a for the entire sample, while Panel B presents triple difference results to examine differences

between government and privately-owned hospitals.

The key takeaway on hospital revenue is the large differential increase in Medicaid revenue for
hospitals with a higher baseline share of uninsured patients. The average hospital generated an increase of
about $55,000 (508*0.11) in annual Medicaid revenue per bed, which is 27% of the pre-ACA mean level.
This estimate implies an incremental $4.1 billion of Medicaid payment to California hospitals each year
over 2014 to 2016 27.

The estimated effect on total revenue for the average hospital is similar in

magnitude, ~$50,000 increase per bed (471*.11), with a small increase from private payers being nullified
by decreases elsewhere. Since total revenue was about five times as large as Medicaid alone, this increase
represents only 5% of the pre-ACA mean. However, it eliminates more than 10% of the pre-ACA gap of 25

The results by hospital type tend to be noisy and the estimates for government and private hospitals are typically not
statistically indistinguishable due to the imprecision. However, there are a few instances in which the estimates for government
hospitals are statistically significant but are statistically indistinguishable from privately-owned hospitals, which are not
statistically significant. Since this is not discernible in the table, we will highlight these results whenever noteworthy.
26 To account for outliers in the financial data, we winsorize the top 1% of revenues, volume measures (stays and visits), and
expansion variables (capital expenditures and license beds). For operating margin, we also winsorize outliers in the bottom 1% of
values since some hospitals reported extremely negative margins. We winsorize by year, hospital type (government and
privately-owned), and when applicable by payer type (e.g. Medicaid, Private, etc.) and type of service (inpatient vs. outpatient).
We compute total revenue as the sum of the winsorized components rather than winsorizing it independently so that the
coefficients add up across columns. Furthermore, by winsorizing values by hospital type, we eliminate the possibility that outliers
of one hospital type drive our results in Panel B.
27 Multiplying 55,000 increase in Medicaid revenue per bed per year for the average hospital with 235 beds per hospital and 320
general acute care hospitals in the sample = $4.1 billion.

29

$385,000 between top and bottom quintile hospitals by baseline uninsurance. Figure 8a presents event study
plots obtained by estimating equation 6b. The flexibly estimated annual estimates are consistent with the
average point estimates discussed above. Hospitals with greater baseline uninsurance appear to have a
decreasing trend of Medicaid revenue in the pre-ACA period, but it reverses sharply after 2013. This
suggests that our point estimates may even understate the magnitude of the increase in Medicaid revenue
due to the ACA.
Government-owned hospitals disproportionately served county indigent patients in the pre-ACA
period – 15% of their patients versus 3% at privately-owned hospitals, as well as more self-pay patients
(14% vs. 8%). Hence as a group, government hospitals had much more to gain from the insurance
expansions. The results by owner type in Table 8b confirm that government hospitals gained more from the
expansion. The average government hospital experienced a ~$200,000 increase in revenue per bed
(663*0.29), about 25% of the mean pre-ACA level for government hospitals. In contrast, the average private
hospital experienced a ~$90,000 increase in revenue per bed (793*0.11), representing an 9% increase
relative to their pre-ACA mean.
Previous studies argue that public hospitals have soft budget constraints (Duggan, 2000; Baicker
and Staiger, 2005) and hence the increased revenue due to Medicaid would be offset by an equivalent
reduction in public subsidies. Our results appear to contradict these previous studies, however future
reductions in DSH payments may mitigate the revenue gains for public hospitals.

C.

Price vs. Volume and profitability
Table 8 columns 7-10 examine effects on volume and average ‘price’ (mean revenue per discharge)

components to help explain their role in the revenue effects described above. The nature of the data makes
it necessary to examine quantity and price separately by inpatient and outpatient services. Column 11
presents the results on total reported operating margin, computed by dividing the difference between
operating revenue and costs by operating revenue. 28 Examining price and volume separately helps clarify
that the aggregate increase in revenue is driven entirely by price, consistent with Medicaid replacing
uncompensated care. A hospital with 10% greater uninsurance share now receives $1,000 more per
inpatient stay, sufficient to eliminate 12% of the pre-ACA disparity between top and bottom quintile
hospitals by uninsurance (-$8,600).
Hospitals with greater baseline uninsurance lost patient volume relative to those previously serving
a lower share of uninsured patients. Since baseline uninsurance was much lower for private hospitals (by
18 pp), this further corroborates previous results indicating a shift in patient volume from government to
28 Operating revenue is largely composed of patient revenue (90%+), but also includes non-patient revenue due to food and
merchandise sales. It does not include investment income. Operating costs are opaque since we do not observe its components.

private hospitals. The coefficient of -5.8 implies that the average government hospital has a decrease of 1.1
stays per bed (-5.8*0.18) relative to the average private hospital, about 3% (1.1/44) of the mean volume.
This is strikingly similar to the estimated loss in government hospital share (-3.5*0.18/16 = ~4%) in the
geographical analysis, reported in Table 7. Figure 8b presents event study plots illustrating the contrast in
patterns for price and volume. Reassuringly there is no evidence of differential trends prior to the expansion.
Driven by the increased average reimbursement per discharge, hospitals with greater baseline
uninsurance received a large boost in profitability. The average hospital gained about 4 pp in operating
margin (35*0.11). Back of the envelope calculations imply that this translates to a gain of ~$9 million for
the average acute care hospital. 29 If we aggregate this across the 320 hospitals in our sample, it implies a
collective increase of $2.8 billion in hospital operating profit due to the ACA, or about 70% of the estimated
increase in Medicaid revenue.
The increase in price and profitability discussed above is clearly driven by government hospitals.
The average government hospital experienced an increase of ~$5,000 in reimbursement per inpatient stay
(16*0.28) and 12 percentage points in operating margin (40*0.28) due to the Medicaid expansion, both of
these estimates are statistically significant at the 1% level. All these results account for any reductions in
government DSH support and hence imply a large windfall for government hospitals due to the ACA. In
contrast, the estimated effects for private hospitals are much smaller and statistically insignificant. Figure
8c presents the corresponding event study plot of effects on operating margin by hospital type.
Overall, the results on hospital revenue and profitability are consistent with lobbying by hospital,
physician and nursing industry associations to prevent repeal of the Medicaid expansion as well as to
continue delays in cutting federal DSH support. 30

D.

Hospital expansion
The increase in revenue and profitability does not seem to encourage expansion; we find no

evidence of differential increase in capital investments (column 12) or bed capacity (column 13). This is
not entirely surprising as only a three year follow-up period may preclude finding effects on long-term
investment decisions.

29 Gain in operating profit is obtained by using increases in operating margin on the base revenue and factoring in number of
beds, all for the average hospital: 0.35 coefficient * 0.11 mean uninsurance * $968,000 mean revenue per bed * 235 beds = $8.8
million. The mean operating profit in the pre-ACA period was 0.023*968,000*235 = $5.2 million. These underlying mean values
are reported in Table 8 and notes. The pre-ACA mean operating margin for hospitals with non-negative values was 8%.

DISCUSSION
We note three caveats related to our data and research designs that impose the following limitations
when interpreting our results. First, the RD-DD results are estimates of local average treatment effects and
most relevant to individuals close to age 65. The near elderly group of patients is policy relevant since it
may be the next group to benefit from an expansion of Medicare. 31 However, they may not represent the
average effect for the entire non-elderly group. Reassuringly, the results using geographic variation in
poverty for all adults aged 21-64 corroborate key findings from the RD-DD analysis.
Second, we cannot identify the mechanisms causing patient sorting toward privately-owned
hospitals. Our interpretation of the result – bolstered by corroborating evidence from ER arrivals – is that
it is driven by patient preference for better care, but an alternative possible explanation is that managed care
plans (which account for the majority of Medicaid enrollees) are more likely to include (exclude) private
(government) hospitals from their provider networks. The evidence on systematic exclusion is weak, at
least for exchange plans. Haeder, Weimer and Mukamel (2015) examine the breadth, access and quality of
insurer networks offered on California’s ACA exchanges relative to commercial health plans. They find
that exchange plan networks are narrower but do not correlate with hospital ownership or quality. Thus, it
seems unlikely that narrow networks are the primary reason.
Third, our results estimate short-run effects of the insurance expansion since our data spans only
three years post-ACA. The flexibly estimated annual coefficients may provide helpful guidance on how
long-term effects may differ. Notably, the trends of increase in volume of care and patient sorting toward
privately-owned hospitals strengthened between 2014 and 2016. This may represent an ongoing process of
newly insured individuals learning how to choose providers and obtain care. This process implies
continuation of volume growth and patient sorting over the next few years and therefore greater long-run
effects, including on patient health.

CONCLUSION
The ACA authorized the largest expansion of publicly funded insurance since the introduction of

Medicare and Medicaid in the 1960s. This intervention offers a unique opportunity to quantify the effects
of public insurance expansions on providers and patients in a modern setting. In this paper we focused on
the hospital sector. Using the universe of all hospital stays and ER visits, as well as data on hospital finances
over 2008-16, we apply several complementary research designs to quantify costs and benefits of the ACA
in the most populous state in the U.S.

31
Since the 1990s several unsuccessful legislative proposals have been floated to expand Medicare to cover near-elderly
individuals aged 55-64. The latest one (still on-going) was introduced in August 2017 in the US Senate. See
https://www.stabenow.senate.gov/news/senator-stabenow-announces-medicare-at-55-act for more details.

We find that the Medicaid expansion almost completely replaced existing county run safety-net
programs in California. This was a transfer from federal taxpayers to local taxpayers (mostly counties) that
previously bore these costs. Further, since Medicaid reimbursed hospitals at twice the rate that the safety
net programs did, this was also a large transfer from taxpayers to hospitals. Hospitals increased revenue
and profitability, with government hospitals receiving larger gains, even though they lost some patient share
to privately-owned hospitals post-ACA. Understanding how the additional revenue was and will be
deployed by hospitals remains an important question for future research.
We fail to find robust improvements in patient health, even though volume of hospital care has
increased substantially and patients are more likely to receive care at privately-owned and better-quality
hospitals. We argue that this reallocation of patient volume is demand driven, though our research design
cannot distinguish supply and demand mechanisms and we leave this exercise for future work. The increase
in stays and ER visits is about three times what we would predict based on partial equilibrium insurance
experiments, suggesting that general equilibrium effects are large. We speculate that supply side responses
are responsible, though the channels need to be investigated in future research.
The effects that we estimate for patients and hospitals were driven primarily by the expansion of
Medicaid. These results take on additional significance when one considers that more than a dozen states
have recently followed California’s (and 24 other states) lead in 2014 and elected to expand their Medicaid
programs. An additional 14 states have, as of this date, not expanded their Medicaid programs. The variation
across states in decisions likely partially reflects uncertainty about the effects. We help fill this evidence
gap as more states consider whether to expand public health insurance in the years ahead.

1b: Uninsured trend by age

1c: Insurance coverage trend for patients aged 21-64

Figure 1: Insurance coverage for hospitalized patients
Note: This figure presents trends in primary insurance coverage among hospitalized patients in California as recorded in hospital
discharge data. Panels A and B present the percentage of hospital stays covered by Medicaid and uninsured (i.e. self-pay, county
indigent or charity care), respectively, by year between 2010-16 and single year of age for ages 10-75. Panel C presents shares of
different primary payers between 2008-16 for patients aged 21-64, the group primarily affected by the ACA. The sample excludes
cases related to pregnancy and deliveries, is limited to General Acute Care hospitals and excludes individuals residing in zip codes
outside California.

37

2a: Elderly patients

2b: Young patients

Figure 2: Insurance coverage
Note: This figure presents the percentage point change in insurance coverage among hospital patients and corresponding fitted
values by month-of-age. These were obtained by estimating equation 3a on discharge level data as described in Section IV.A for
the sample of elderly (Panel A) and young (Panel B) patients, respectively. The treated groups are those aged 21 (young) and 64
(elderly). Both panels present results for 2011-16 (circles, solid line), and results from 2008-11 (squares, dashed line), which serves
as a falsification exercise. The dependent variable – insurance coverage – is defined by the patient not being self-pay, on charity or
county indigent care and values are either 0 or 100. All models control linearly for age and include year fixed effects. To improve
presentation, we collapse the data to month-of-age cells. We also note the estimated change in discontinuity, which is the coefficient
on 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 . 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 in Equation 3a. Standard errors are clustered by day-of-age cell. Figure A. 4 presents a more detailed version showing
changes in shares of specific payers.

38

3a: Hospital stays

3b: Emergency room arrivals

Figure 3: Utilization rate (per 1,000 people per year)
Note: This figure presents the mean post-ACA change in number of hospital stays (Panel A) and ER arrivals (Panel B), i.e. including
those patients who were eventually admitted as inpatients, per 1,000 CA residents in each month-of-age cell. Raw discharges were
converted to utilization rates using California population estimates, obtained from the National Cancer Institute. The regressions
were estimated on data at day-of-age - year level, but for presentation clarity we collapse data to month-of-age level. Patients aged
64 constitute the treated group. We also plot corresponding fitted values (dashed lines) obtained by estimating Equation 4, as
described in Section IV.C. All models control linearly for age and include a full set of year fixed effects. We also note the estimated
change in discontinuity, which is the coefficient on 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 . 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 in equation 4. Standard errors are clustered by day-of-age cell. Figure A.
5 presents corresponding plots for young patients.

4a: Owner type

4b: Standardized mortality score

Figure 4: Hospital choice: Owner type and quality
Note: This figure presents post-ACA percentage point change in the percent of hospital stays at government hospitals (Panel A)
and in mean standardized mortality score for patients, a variable with mean 0 and SD of 100 (Panel B). We also plot fitted values
obtained by estimating equation 3b on case level data as described in Section IV.A. Patients aged 64 constitute the treated group.
Regressions were estimated at the day-of-age - year level but for presentation clarity the data is collapsed to month-of-age level.
Regressions control linearly for age and include year fixed effects. The estimated change in discontinuity, which is the coefficient
on 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 . 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 in equation 3b, is also presented. Standard errors are clustered by day-of-age cell. Figure A. 7 presents the corresponding
plots for young patients.

Figure 5: Distribution of poverty rates across Hospital Service Areas
Note: This figure presents a histogram of poverty percentage across Hospital Service Areas (HSAs). Poverty share is defined as
the share of population < 125% of federal poverty level, as estimated by the 2007-11 five-year American Community Survey.
There are 210 HSAs in California and they are defined to approximate local markets for hospital care and typically contain only
one hospital. For more details on HSAs refer to http://www.dartmouthatlas.org/tools/faq/researchmethods.aspx. The San Francisco
bay area has a disproportionate concentration of low poverty markets, for example – San Ramon (2%), Pleasanton (5%), Walnut
Creek (6%), Burlingame, San Mateo and Fremont (7%), Mountain View and Livermore (8%). High poverty markets are distributed
across the state with some concentration in central California along interstate 5 – Lindsay (41%), Delano (38%), Corcoran (35%),
Lake Isabella (33%), Dinuba, Porterville (31%), and Merced (27%). The difference in poverty rates across HSAs was 18.3 between
the least and most affluent quintiles and coincidentally the mean across markets was also 18.4. We exploit this variation in poverty
across markets to identify the effects of the ACA on non-elderly adult hospital use.

6b: Hospital utilization (log volume)

6c: Hospital choice (owner type)

Figure 6: Results using poverty variation
Note: This figure presents event studies from the geographic analysis. Each panel plots coefficients on the interaction of 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗 and
indicator for each year 𝑠𝑠 from 2011-16 (relative to 2013), obtained by estimating equation 5b with Medicaid or self-pay status
(Panel A), log of stays or ER arrivals (Panel B), and share of stays at non-profit hospitals (Panel C) as outcome variables. Bars
indicate confidence intervals at the 95% level. 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗 is the estimated share of people in HSA j with income below 125% of the
federal poverty level as reported by the ACS 2007-11 5-year estimates. These models are estimated using data from the sample of
all patients aged 21-64 over 2011-16, about 7.5 million stays and 40.3 million ER arrivals. All models are estimated with data
collapsed to the HSA-year level and include HSA and year fixed effects. HSAs are weighted by pre-ACA non-elderly population.
Mean poverty rate was 0.183.

7b: Hospital uninsurance distribution (2014-2016)

Figure 7: Hospital uninsurance distribution
Note: This figure presents histograms (by hospital) of the percentage of patients that did not have insurance coverage, in 2008-10
(Panel A, pre-ACA) and 2014-16 (Panel B, post-ACA), respectively. Uninsured patients are those coded as self-pay, county
indigent or charity care. These histograms were computed using the discharge data on hospital stays and make use of the same
sample restrictions as in our main analysis – limit to non-elderly adults (aged 21-64) in general acute care hospitals, exclude
childbirth related cases, and exclude cases for individuals with zip codes missing or located outside California. The percent
uninsured is top coded at 50% (one hospital in 2008-10). We use this variation in uninsurance across hospitals to identify effects
of the ACA on hospital finances.

8a: Revenue

8b: Volume vs. Price

8c: Operating margin by hospital type

Figure 8: Effects on hospital finances
Note: This figure presents event study results using hospital-year finances data from OSHPD. We plot coefficients on the interaction
of Uninsuredℎ−0810 with indicators for each year 𝑠𝑠 from 2011-16, omitting 2013 as the reference year, obtained by estimating
equation 6b with various outcome variables. Bars indicate confidence intervals at the 95% level. Uninsuredℎ−0810 is the share of
hospital h patients coded self-pay, charity or county indigent over 2008-10. In Panel A the revenue values have been deflated to be
in thousands of 2016 dollars. Panel B presents patterns for number of inpatient stays per bed (volume) and mean revenue per
discharge in thousands of 2016 dollars (price). Panel C presents results on operating margin obtained by estimating models
separately on the sample of government and private hospitals. Prices here refer to mean reimbursement per hospital stay. All models
include hospital and year fixed effects. Hospital observations are weighted by their number of discharges in 2008-10.

discontinuity analysis and geographic analysis respectively. Both samples begin with the universe of all discharges and use three sample restrictions – 1) only general acute care
hospitals 2) exclude pregnancy and delivery related cases and 3) exclude patients with missing or out-of-CA zip codes. Fraction uninsured includes patients coded as self-pay,
charity or county indigent coverage. Panel A focuses on cases pertaining to ages 20-21 (both inclusive) or 64-65, and all ages are at time of admission. ER arrivals include ER
visits and hospital stays that originated in the ER. To calculate utilization, we normalize number of annual stays/ER arrivals by the population in relevant age-year cell obtained
from the National Cancer Institute, hence these are measures of utilization per 1,000 people per year. Government hospitals include city, county and district but not federally
owned hospitals. We present in-hospital mortality for the full sample as well as the sample of patients discharged with non-deferrable conditions (i.e. conditions like Heart attack,
Pneumonia, Stroke, etc.), for which patients need urgent hospital care and hence are less susceptible to selection concerns.

Note: This table presents regression results on changes in insurance coverage using the RD-DD analysis. Coefficients presented are
on the interaction of indicator for being in the treated group (age 21 or 64) and post-ACA period in equation 3a. Regressions were
estimated on the sample of elderly (Panel A) and young (Panel B) patients respectively, as described in section IV.A. The dependent
variable is coverage by specific payer type. Miscellaneous includes Medicare, Government employees and workers’ compensation.
In each column and panel, the top row presents the average effect, while the dynamic effects present coefficients for each post-ACA
year. This table pertains to hospital stays only. All models control linearly for age and include a full set of year fixed effects. Standard
errors are clustered by day-of-age cell.

Note: This table presents regression results on changes in volume of hospital care using the RD-DD analysis. Coefficients presented are on the interaction of
indicator for being aged 64 and post-ACA period in equation 4. Regressions were estimated on the sample of elderly patients, as described in section IV.C. The
dependent variable is rate of hospital stays or ER arrivals per 1,000 people per year. To generate these utilization rates, we normalize raw discharges by population
estimates for each age-year cell obtained from the National Cancer Institute. Column 1 presents the results for all hospital stays. Columns 2 and 3 present results
separately based on stays that originated through and not through ERs respectively. Columns 4 and 5 present results on stays for deferrable and non-deferrable
conditions respectively. Non-deferrable refers to about 15 conditions such as Heart Attack, Pneumonia, Stroke, etc. that are emergent and require immediate
hospital care. Column 6 presents results for all ER arrivals, while column 7 presents results only on ER visits i.e. where the patient was discharged from the ER.
All models control linearly for age and include a full set of year fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by day-of-age cell. Appendix Table A. 4 presents
results for young patients.

Note: This table presents regression results on changes in hospital share using the RD-DD analysis. We explore changes on two
dimensions – hospital owner type and quality scores. Coefficients presented are on the interaction of indicator for being aged 64 and
post-ACA period in equation 3b. Regressions were estimated on the sample of elderly patients, as described in section IV.A. Panels A
and B present results for the hospital stays and ER arrivals respectively. The sample for hospital owner type contains ~560,000
discharges while in case of quality scores the sample is smaller (~460,000) since some hospitals are not rated by CMS. The
corresponding sample sizes in case of ER arrivals are 1.3 mn and 1.1 mn respectively. The dependent variables are indicators for nonprofit, for-profit or government ownership (Columns 1-3) and standardized 30-day mortality and readmission scores reported by CMS
in 2009 (Columns 4-5). All models control linearly for age and include year fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by day-of-age
cell. We also estimated a version of column 4 controlling for hospital ownership. Estimates were -1.6 (0.5) and -0.7 (0.4) for hospital
stays and ER arrivals respectively. Appendix Table A. 5 presents corresponding estimates for the young patients.

Note: This table presents results of a falsification exercise for the RD-DD analysis using data from 2008-11 (pre-ACA) imagining a placebo ACA in 2010. Coefficients presented are on
the interaction of indicator for being aged 64 and post-2010 in equations 3a, 3b and 4. This exercise provides equivalent estimates to the main estimates on insurance coverage (Table 2),
utilization (Table 3), hospital choice (Table 4) and health (Table A. 2) outcomes. All models control linearly for age and include year fixed effects. When examining effects on volume, we
collapse the data to the day of age-year level. When examining effects on patient health, models control for patient gender and condition category. Standard errors are clustered by day-ofage cell.

provides estimates on insurance coverage and volume of care. In the interest of brevity we do not report effects for the full set of outcome variables, but these are available on request.
Panel A presents the DD coefficient on interaction of 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 ⋅ 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 from Equation 5a, where poverty rate is the share of non-elderly population below 125% of federal poverty
level as reported by 2007-11 ACS 5-year estimates. Panel B presents coefficients from equation 5b flexibly estimated for each year over 2011-16 with 2013 as the reference year. There
are approximately 7.5 million stays and 40.3 million ER arrivals, collapsed to the HSA-year level (209 HSAs x 6 years). The volume regressions use log of discharges as the outcome.
Non-deferrable refers to the subset of approximately 1 million cases that were for non-deferrable or emergent conditions such as Heart attacks, Pneumonia, etc. All models include a
full set of HSA and year fixed effects. HSAs are weighted by pre-ACA non-elderly population. Standard errors are clustered by HSA. The bottom row presents the pre-ACA mean
values for outcomes. The mean values for volume are in levels, not logs. The difference in poverty rates between top and bottom quintile HSAs was 0.183 and coincidentally the mean
was 0.184.

Note: This table presents results from the geographic analysis exploiting variation in poverty rate across hospital service markets
(HSAs), as described in Section V.A. This table provides estimates on utilization (choice of hospital type and quality) and patient
health (in-hospital mortality). In the interest of brevity we do not report effects for the full set of outcome variables, but these are
available on request. Panel A presents the DD coefficient on interaction of 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 ⋅ 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 from Equation 5a, where poverty
rate is the share of non-elderly population below 125% of federal poverty level as reported by 2007-11 ACS 5-year estimates. Panel
B presents coefficients from equation 5b flexibly estimated for each year over 2011-16 with 2013 as the reference year. There are
approximately 7.5 million stays collapsed to the HSA-year level (209 HSAs x 6 years). Models for mortality are also estimated at
the HSA-year level, on the entire sample (Col. 4) and sample of non-deferrable cases (Col. 5) respectively. Non-deferrable refers
to the subset of approximately 1 million stays that were admitted for non-deferrable or emergent conditions such as Heart attacks,
Pneumonia, etc. All models include a full set of HSA and year fixed effects. When examining effects on patient health, models also
control for differences in patient gender and condition category. HSAs are weighted by pre-ACA non-elderly population. Standard
errors are clustered by HSA. The bottom row presents the pre-ACA mean values for outcomes. The difference in poverty rates
between top and bottom quintile HSAs was 0.183 and coincidentally the mean was 0.184.

Note: This table presents regression results examining effects on hospital finances and expansion by exploiting baseline (2008-10) variation in hospitals’ uninsured patient shares,
as discussed in section VI.A. Coefficients presented are for the interaction of baseline uninsurance and an indicator for the post-ACA period in equation 6a. All revenue variables
are expressed in thousands of dollars deflated to 2016 using the CPI-U. We winsorize values for revenue, volume, and expansion variables at the 99th percentile, and operating
margin at the 1st and 99th percentile (more details in footnote 26). Operating margin is reported by hospitals to California as a percentage and is calculated as the ratio of the
difference between operating revenue and costs over operating revenue. Panel A presents average effects across all hospitals. Panel B presents results from estimating a triple
difference version of equation 6a where Uninsured * Post provides estimates for privately-owned hospitals and the sum of Uninsured * Post + Uninsured * Post * Govt Hospital
provides estimates for government hospitals. The bottom rows present the number of observations (e.g. ~320 hospitals x 6 years) and mean value of each dependent variable preACA, i.e. 2011-13 overall and by hospital type. 78 hospitals have no outpatient visits or revenue and hence drop out when examining mean revenue per outpatient visit. All models
include a full set of hospital and year fixed effects. Hospital observations are weighted by their number of discharges in 2008-10. Standard errors are clustered by hospital. The
mean baseline share of uninsured patients across all hospitals was 0.11. It was 0.288 and 0.108 for government and private hospitals respectively.

APPENDIX: FOR ONLINE PUBLICATION
A.1a: Medicaid share in expansion states

A.1b: Medicaid share in non-expansion states

Figure A. 1: Medicaid share in expansion and non-expansion states
Note: This figure presents the Medicaid enrollment as a share of a state’s population for states that expanded Medicaid under the
ACA, as of January 1, 2014, (Panel A) and those that did not (Panel B). Medicaid share as of July-Sept 2013 (i.e. pre-ACA) is
depicted in blue and the change through October 2016 is plotted in red. In both figures, states are sorted in ascending order by
Medicaid’s share of population as in 2013. Comparable baseline data was not available for Connecticut (expanded) and Maine (did
not expand).

53

Figure A. 2: Medicaid and exchange enrollment in California
Note: This figure presents monthly enrollment in Medicaid and on the ACA exchange in California (right axis) over 2010-16.
Enrollment data was obtained from CA Department of Health Care Services (Medicaid) and Covered California (Exchange)
respectively.

54

Figure A. 3: California Medicaid eligibility requirements
Note: This figure presents an extract from an official notice on California Medicaid (Medi-Cal) eligibility requirements. This is
available at http://www.dhcs.ca.gov/formsandpubs/forms/Forms/MCED/Info_Notice/MC002_ENG_0907.pdf and pertains to
2007. The top right portion discusses age thresholds for a person to be eligible for Medicaid under the “indigent” category, i.e. not
disability or welfare recipient. Childless adults were usually ruled out unless they had special circumstances such as pregnancy (in
the case of women) or were in a nursing home.

55

A.4a: Insurance change for the elderly

A.4b: Insurance change for the young

Figure A. 4: Insurance coverage changes (details)
Note: This figure presents observed coverage rates for different insurers, collapsed to age-month bin and corresponding fitted
values (dashed line) obtained by estimating equation 3a on discharge level data as described in Section IV.A. It is a more detailed
version of Figure 2. Self-pay includes charity care. The figure pertains to hospital stays in the RD sample for elderly (Panel A) and
young (Panel B) patients respectively. All models control linearly for age and include year fixed effects. We also note the estimated
change in discontinuity, which is the coefficient on di . Tt in Equation 3a. Standard errors are clustered by day-of-age cells.

56

Figure A. 5: Hospital utilization by patients aged 21-64 (per 1,000 people)
Note: This figure presents the number of hospital stays (Panel A) and arrivals at Emergency rooms (Panel B) by patients aged 2164 in California over 2011-16. The sample contains about 7.5 million discharges. ER arrivals include ER visits and those who were
subsequently discharged as inpatients and the sample contains about 40.3 million observations. The raw discharges are normalized
by population estimates from the National Cancer Institute for each age-year cell. These population estimates were also used in the
RD-DD analysis for the same purpose. The figure makes use of the same sample restrictions as in our main analysis – limit to
general acute care hospitals, exclude childbirth related cases, and exclude cases for individuals with zip codes missing or located
outside California.

57

A.6a: Hospital stays

A.6b: Emergency room arrivals

Figure A. 6: Rate of utilization for young patients
Note: This figure presents the mean post-ACA change in number of hospital stays (Panel A) and ER arrivals (Panel B), i.e. including
those patients who were eventually admitted as inpatients, per 1,000 CA residents in each month-of-age cell. Raw discharges were
converted to utilization rates using California population estimates, obtained from the National Cancer Institute. The regressions
were estimated on data at day-of-age - year level, but for presentation clarity we collapse data to month-of-age level. Patients aged
21 constitute the treated group. We also plot corresponding fitted values (dashed lines) obtained by estimating Equation 4, as
described in Section IV.C. All models control linearly for age and include a full set of year fixed effects. We also note the estimated
change in discontinuity, which is the coefficient on 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 . 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 in equation 4. Standard errors are clustered by day-of-age cell. Figure 3
presents corresponding results for elderly patients.

58

A.7a: Hospital owner type

A.7b: Hospital quality

Figure A. 7: Hospital choice: Owner type and quality (Young patients)
Note: This figure presents post-ACA percentage point change in the percent of hospital stays at government hospitals (Panel A)
and in mean standardized mortality score for patients, a variable with mean 0 and SD of 100 (Panel B). We also plot fitted values
obtained by estimating equation 3b on case level data as described in Section IV.A. Patients aged 21 constitute the treated group.
Regressions were estimated at the day-of-age - year level but for presentation clarity the data is collapsed to month-of-age level.
Regressions control linearly for age and include year fixed effects. The estimated change in discontinuity, which is the coefficient
on 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 . 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 in equation 3b, is also presented. Standard errors are clustered by day-of-age cell. Figure 4 presents corresponding results
for elderly patients.

Note: This table presents population weighted descriptive statistics and regression discontinuity estimates at ages 21 and 65
using data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) person and sample adult files from 2004-2009. Data is limited
to individuals within 12 months of their 21st and 65th birth month, excluding individuals interviewed in their month of birth.
There are 11,321 and 6,883 such individuals in the person files. The outcomes percent days alcohol in past 12 months, smoking
status and flu shot in past 12 months are taken from the sample adult files which have 4,375 and 3,587 individuals respectively.
Standard errors (in brackets) are adjusted to account for sampling stratification as recommended by NHIS documentation. Mean
value at threshold pertains to the mean value for individuals aged 20 and 65 respectively. RD estimate indicates difference in
mean for individuals aged 21 and 64 (the treatment group) respectively. RD estimate obtained using OLS including linear
polynomial in age and year fixed effects.

Note: This table presents estimated effects on two health outcomes – in-hospital mortality and share of stays/visits that were
potentially avoidable – for elderly patients. Panels A and B present results for hospital stays and ER arrivals respectively. The
dependent variables are indicators for in-hospital death (Columns 1 and 2) and potentially avoidable episode (Columns 3 and 4).
Columns 1 and 3 use the entire sample, while columns 2 and 4 use only the sample of patients discharged with a non-deferrable
condition. Estimated change in discontinuity post-ACA is the coefficient on 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 ⋅ 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 in equation 3b. All models control linearly for
patient age, year fixed effects and observable differences in patient sickness, i.e. diagnosis category and gender. Standard errors
are clustered by day-of-age cell. Table A. 6 presents corresponding results for young patients.

Note: This table presents robustness checks of the main RD-DD results presented earlier. In the interest of brevity, we present results for key outcomes only. Columns 1-5 present
results on changes in insurance coverage (Table 2), columns 6-7 present results on volume of care (Table 3), column 8 present results on hospital choice (Table 4), and columns 1011 present results on patient mortality (Table A. 2). The main results (Panel A) use a 1-year bandwidth and the specification constrains slopes w.r.t. age to remain unchanged pre and
post-ACA. Panel B presents results using a flexible specification keeping a 1-year bandwidth but allowing slopes w.r.t age to change post-ACA. Panels B and C use a sample with
2-year bandwidth, and linear I and linear-flexible (D) specifications respectively. Estimated change in the discontinuity post-ACA is the coefficient on 𝑑𝑑𝑠𝑠 ⋅ 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 in equation 3b. All
models also include a full set of year fixed effects. Columns 10-11 also include controls for observable differences in patient sickness, i.e. diagnosis category and gender. Standard
errors are clustered by day-of-age cell. The number of observations and pre-ACA means for Panels A and B are noted at the end of Panel A, and those for Panels C and D are noted
at the end of Panel C.

Note: This table presents regression results on changes in volume of hospital care using the RD-DD analysis. Coefficients presented are on the interaction of indicator
for being aged 21 and post-ACA period in equation 4. Regressions were estimated on the sample of young patients, as described in section IV.C. The dependent variable
is rate of hospital stays or ER arrivals per 1,000 people per year. To generate these utilization rates, we normalize raw discharges by population estimates for each ageyear cell obtained from the National Cancer Institute. Column 1 presents the results for all hospital stays. Columns 2 and 3 present results separately based on stays that
originated through and not through ERs respectively. Columns 4 and 5 present results on stays for deferrable and non-deferrable conditions respectively. Non-deferrable
refers to about 15 conditions such as Heart Attack, Pneumonia, Stroke, etc. that are emergent and require immediate hospital care. Column 6 presents results for all ER
arrivals, while column 7 presents results only on ER visits i.e. where the patient was discharged from the ER. All models control linearly for age and include a full set
of year fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by day-of-age cell. Table 3 presents corresponding results for elderly patients.

Note: This table presents regression results on changes in hospital share using the RD-DD analysis. We explore changes on two
dimensions – hospital owner type and quality scores. Coefficients presented are on the interaction of indicator for being aged 21
and post-ACA period in equation 3b. Regressions were estimated on the sample of young patients, as described in section IV.A.
Panels A and B present results for the hospital stays and ER arrivals respectively. The sample for hospital owner type contains
~150,000 discharges while in case of quality scores the sample is smaller (~125,000) since some hospitals are not rated. The
corresponding sample sizes in case of ER arrivals are 2 mn and 1.7 mn respectively. The dependent variables are indicators for
government, non-profit or for-profit ownership (Columns 1-3) and standardized 30-day mortality and readmission scores reported
by CMS in 2009 (Columns 4-5). All models control linearly for age and include a full set of year fixed effects. Standard errors
are clustered by day-of-age cell. We also estimated a version of column 4 controlling for hospital ownership. Estimates were 0.54 (1.1) and -0.07 (0.3) for hospital stays and ER arrivals respectively. Table 4 presents corresponding estimates for elderly
patients.

potentially avoidable – for young patients. Panels A and B present results for hospital stays and ER arrivals respectively. The
dependent variables are indicators for in-hospital death (Columns 1 and 2) and potentially avoidable episode (Columns 3 and 4).
Columns 1 and 3 use the entire sample, while columns 2 and 4 use only the sample of patients discharged with a non-deferrable
condition. Estimated change in discontinuity post-ACA is the coefficient on 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 ⋅ 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 in equation 3b. All models control linearly for
patient age, year fixed effects, and observable differences in patient sickness, i.e. diagnosis category and gender. Standard errors
are clustered by day-of-age cell. Table A. 2 presents corresponding results for elderly patients.
