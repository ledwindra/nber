Banks as Lenders of First Resort: Evidence from the COVID-19 Crisis
Lei Li, Philip E. Strahan, and Song Zhang
NBER Working Paper No. 27256
May 2020
JEL No. G2
ABSTRACT
In March of 2020, banks faced the largest increase in liquidity demands ever observed. Firms
drew funds on a massive scale from pre-existing credit lines and loan commitments in
anticipation of cash flow disruptions from the economic shutdown designed to contain the
COVID-19 crisis. The increase in liquidity demands was concentrated at the largest banks, who
serve the largest firms. Pre-crisis financial condition did not limit banks’ liquidity supply.
Coincident inflows of funds to banks from both the Federal Reserve’s liquidity injection
programs and from depositors, along with strong pre-shock bank capital, explain why banks were
able to accommodate these liquidity demands.

I. INTRODUCTION
Firms go first to their bank(s) during a crisis. In the last three weeks of March 2020,
anticipating disruptions to cash flow and external funding conditions, non-financial businesses
drew funds from bank credit lines on an unprecedented scale. The shock occurred as asset prices
had fallen across the capital markets. As a result, commercial and industrial (C&I) loans on bank
balance sheets exploded, increasing by $482 billion between March 11 and April 1. For context,
the weekly growth of bank C&I loans over the past 45 years has averaged 0.12% (with a standard
deviation of 0.47%). Firms drew heavily on bank credit lines following the Lehman bankruptcy
too, with lending increasing by about 6% during last three weeks of September 2008 and the first
two weeks of October, or about 1.2% per week (about 10 times the average). In the last three
weeks of March, however, lending grew more than 6% per week (or about 50 times the average).
The growth in lending during these three weeks exceeded every other weekly growth rate going
all the way back to 1973, when the Federal Reserve’s H.8 releases (Assets and Liabilities of
Commercial Banks in the U.S.) began (see Figure 1).1
The three weeks in March 2020 are an unprecedented stress test on the ability of banks to
supply liquidity. This ‘stress test’ was induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, which was unexpected
to most firms and banks, was non-financial in nature, and affected all industries in the economy.
In this paper, we study how bank characteristics and the characteristics of the markets in which
they operate explain the cross-section of this explosion in lending. Our evidence suggests that all
of the increase in lending occurred through drawdowns on existing credit commitments. Large
banks experienced much more drawdowns than smaller ones. Anecdotal evidence suggests that

https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h8/current/h8.pdf

the drawdowns came mainly from large firms, who typically borrow from the largest banks.2 As
a result, C&I lending grew much faster for banks with assets over $50 billion than for other banks
(Figure 2). We do not find evidence that banks’ financial condition before the onset of the crisis
constrained their lending in this COVID-19 stress test. In other words, our results suggest that
banks passed this stress test.
In particular, we study two questions in this paper: First, how has firm demand for bank
liquidity responded to the onset of the COVID-19 crisis? Viral outbreaks varied substantially
across localities, with some cities such as New York, New Orleans and Detroit facing major
outbreaks and others facing more limited exposure. State and local governments responded
differently to the pandemic, both in the intensity and in the timing of lockdowns and other
measures aimed to slow the disease. For example, states like California initiated lockdowns early,
while other states such as Texas initiated these policies weeks later. We measure the size of local
outbreaks using two strategies, one based on local employment declines in small firms, and the
other by ex-post death rates from the COVID-19. We show much larger increases in lending at
banks near large outbreaks.
Second, does bank financial condition constrain their ability to meet the unexpected
increase in liquidity demands from their business clientele? To answer this question, we build off
models developed by Cornett et al. (2011), who study a related phenomenon during the Financial
Crisis of 2007–2009. Cornett et al. (2011) find that banks adjust to shocks to liquidity demands
by reducing new credit origination, and that the changes in credit supply depend on bank financial

constraints. Specifically, in the 2007-2009 period banks more reliant on core deposits, banks
holding more liquid assets, and banks with more capital cut new lending less (increased lending
more) than other banks. Our research tests whether or not these bank financial conditions have
affected liquidity supply in response to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. 3 One key difference
between 2007-2009 and now is that the Federal Reserve has intervened more quickly and more
massively this time. Another difference is that banks have amassed more capital due to the
regulatory changes since 2008. Thus, we can assess whether these interventions helped alleviate
the effect of bank financial constraints on lending during the COVID-19 crisis.
We show that the advent of the COVID-19 crisis explains the increase in lending, as banks
located near areas with larger outbreaks experienced faster loan growth. Large banks with high
levels of unused loan commitments to business experienced by far the largest increases in lending.
These banks, however, were able to fund the liquidity demands due to the massive increase in
deposits, which grew by about $1 trillion in aggregate during the crisis weeks, twice as much as
the aggregate increase in lending. Our cross-bank regressions find no evidence that bank lending
grew more at those financed more with stable deposits before the crisis. Similarly, we do not find
that pre-crisis measures of asset liquidity explain increases in lending. These two ‘non-results’
suggest that concern about liquidity posed no constraint on banks, in stark contrast to what
happened during the 2008 crisis. Moreover, we find no evidence that bank capital constrained
their lending either. Again, in striking contrast to 2008, bank lending did not vary with capital in
response to the COVID-19 crisis.

3

Our model differs slightly from theirs in defining liquid assets. Cornett et al. define mortgage-backed and assetbacked securities as illiquid because these asset classes were at the center of the 2008 crisis. In this paper, we treat
them the same as other securities (that is, we treat them as liquid assets).

4

To develop our tests, we exploit two datasets: the quarterly Call Reports and weekly
confidential FR 2644 data. The Q4, 2019 Call Report provides detailed measures of bank financial
condition at the outset of the crisis, which we use to explain lending growth during Q1, 2020.
Since lending exploded during the last three weeks of March (recall Figures 1 & 2), the bulk of
the loan-growth variation during Q1, 2020 represents the effects of the liquidity shock during these
three weeks. Hence, we exploit weekly growth in bank lending using the confidential FR 2644
data that underlie the Federal Reserve’s H.8 releases. These are the only data that permit highfrequency analysis of the precise timing of the expansion of lending across banks. We construct
all of our estimates within-bank (i.e., with bank fixed effects) to remove unobserved heterogeneity
in bank lending patterns observed during normal (non-crisis) conditions.
Using the high frequency FR 2644 data, we control for lending patterns during normal
periods based on the seven weeks between January 22 and March 11, after which lending took
off.4 In a parallel set of tests, we validate our results using the lower frequency Call Report data,
where we control for lending during normal periods based on the eight quarters leading up to the
first quarter of 2020. Call Report data allow us to include all banks (rather than just the weekly
reporting banks in FR 2644), and also allow us to model both on-balance sheet lending increases
as well as total credit production (the sum of loans on balance sheet plus undrawn commitments).
However, it does not allow us to pinpoint the exact timing of the liquidity shock. Our results across
the two approaches are consistent, both in terms of statistical significance and economic
magnitude.

January 22 was the date of the first reported case of COVID-19 in the U.S. March 11 is the beginning of the rapid
onset of loan drawdowns and corresponds with the World Health Organzation’s declaration of a global pandemic.

Our identification strategy assumes no correlation between pre-crisis bank characteristics
and the liquidity demand shock that occurs in March 2020. While we see no reason to assume
otherwise – the pandemic and ensuing market panic was certainly a surprise to everyone – we
show that our results are similar when we vary the set of variables capturing liquidity demand. In
fact, our results are also similar (quantitatively) in models using the Call Report data, which omit
local demand covariates.
Our paper contributes to the literature on banks’ role as liquidity suppliers to firms. Earlier
research suggests that combining deposits and off-balance sheet credit commitments creates
diversification synergies, which allow banks to hold less cash (Kashap, Rajan and Stein, 2002).
Gatev and Strahan (2006) argue that the synergy is especially powerful during periods of market
stress because deposits flow into banks at the same time that borrower liquidity demands peak.
Ivashina and Scharstein (2010) find evidence consistent with this latter mechanism during the 2008
crisis, although Acharya and Mora (2015) find that banks paid higher rates to attract deposits. In
this paper, we show that aggregate deposit inflows were more than enough to fund the increase in
liquidity demands; these flows explain why pre-crisis deposits do not co-vary with lending across
banks.
We also contribute to the emerging literature on the economic and financial consequences
of the COVID-19 crisis. Many empirical papers study the stock market reaction to the pandemic,
finding a strong response of equity prices to news about the virus and an increase in market
volatility (Alfaro, Chari, Greenland, and Schott (2020); Baker, Bloom, Davis, Kost, Sammon, and
Viratyosin (2020; Caballero and Simsek (2020)). Some studies compare how different types of
stocks respond to the pandemic. Ding, Levine, Lin, and Xie (2020) find firms more exposed to
the global supply chain fared worse, while Ramelli and Wagner (2020) find that exposure to
6

international trade is also associated with poor stock price performance. Another set of studies
focus on non-financial firms. Bartik, Bertrand, Cullen, Glaeser, Luca, and Stanton (2020), based
on a survey small businesses, find a rapid onset of mass layoffs and concern by their surveyed
firms about financial fragility. Several other authors study the early impact of the CARES Act and
the Payroll Protection Program (Humphries, Neilson, and Ulyssea (2020); Granja, Makridis,
Yannelis, and Zwick (2020); Cororaton and Rosen (2020)).
Like us, a number of studies focus on the effect of debt and liquidity on non-financial firms.
Albuquerque et al. (2020) find stock returns at firms with high leverage ratios fared much worse
during the crisis than those with less leverage, while Fahlenbrach, Rageth, and Stulz (2020) find
that firms with more financial flexibility did better. De Vito and Gómez (2020) find that most
firms would exhaust their cash holdings within two years, consistent with many firms relying on
banks for liquidity. Our paper is most closely related to Acharya and Steffen (2020a), who
document that access to bank credit lines during the COVID-19 crisis helped non-financial firms,
based on stock return patterns. Their paper studies the role of access to bank liquidity from the
borrower perspective, whereas we study the problem from the bank (supply-side) perspective.
In another related note, Acharya and Steffen (2020b) apply models estimated from the prepandemic period to simulate the extent of credit line drawdowns at banks during the COVID-19
crisis. These models suggest that credit line usage increases when stock market returns are low
(Berg et al. (2017)). Their analysis simulates aggregate loan drawdowns of $264 billion for the
aggregate U.S. banking system, which is a little more than half of the increased lending seen in
March 2020. They argue that banks overall are sufficiently well capitalized to accommodate this
simulated demand for liquidity, but our data suggest the actual stress on banks has been
substantially larger than the simulated one. Nevertheless, consistent with their conclusion, we find
7

no evidence based on individual bank behavior that capital constrained their ability to meet this
unprecedented demand for cash.

II. EMPIRICAL METHODS, DATA, AND RESULTS
Weekly Increases in Lending: Empirical Model & Data
The onset of the global COVID-19 virus pandemic initiated a market panic that led to a
dramatic increase in firm drawdowns on existing credit lines. We exploit this increase in
drawdowns in developing our empirical model, focusing on the three weeks from March 11
through April 1 as the period when liquidity demand spiked.5 In our first empirical models, we
use weekly data to construct the indicator variable Crisis, equal to one during these three weeks.
To see how unusual this period is, Figure 3 illustrates the weekly growth in bank C&I loans from
the beginning of 2020. The figure shows very clearly that these three weeks stand out from the
early period. Moreover, the figure shows no unusual growth in other loans (e.g., real estate,
consumer, etc.) during this time. Consistent with our interpretation, Acharya and Steffen (2020a)
use data from S&P’s Loan Commentary and Data to document that large public corporations drew
about $225 billion on their bank lines during this period, which is only half of the increase in bank
C&I lending in our data (about $480 billion). The difference probably reflects drawdowns by
private firms.

We end the analysis on April 1 for several reasons. First, the rush to draw funds from pre-existing credit lines had
abated by then. Second, we want the weekly analysis to be comparable to the analysis from the Q1, 2020 Call
Report data. Third, government programs such as the Payroll Protection Program began in early April, which
changed the main source of variation in bank lending and would require a different modeling approach.

We use this unexpected shock to liquidity demand to study whether bank financial
condition affected their willingness to supply liquidity. Having such a bright-line increase in
liquidity demand is nearly unique; it allows us to trace out how (or whether) financial condition
constrained banks’ ability to supply liquidity. The weeks after Lehman’s bankruptcy in 2008 offer
the only other similar situation. Cornett et al. (2011) show that both liquidity and capital affected
bank liquidity supply then. We report similar tests, though as discussed in the introduction the
increase in drawdowns during the COVID-19 crisis dwarfs that observed during the most intense
weeks of the 2008 crisis.
Using the shock to liquidity demand in March 2020, we estimate models of weekly bank
lending of the following form:
ΔC&I Loansi,t/Ai,Q4,2019 = αi + β0Crisist + ΣβjCrisist*Bank Financial Conditionji,Q4, 2019 +
ΣγkLocal Demand Conditionski,t + εi,t .

(1)

The outcome in Equation (1) represents the weekly change in C&I lending from the Federal
Reserve’s FR 2644 dataset for bank i in week t, scaled by the bank’s total assets from the end of
the prior quarter.6 We include the weeks from January 22 to April 1, 2020 for all of the domestic
reporting banks, and set Crisis to one during the last three weeks of the sample. The FR 2644 data
come from an authorized random stratified sample of weekly reporting banks.7 We include a bank

Results are similar using weekly loan growth as the outcome, although this variable contains large outliers. We
prefer to normalize by beginning of period assets to eliminate the influence of outliers.

aggregates and were obtained through a confidential survey of depository institutions that requires confidential
treatment of institution-level data and any information that identifies the individual institutions that reported the data.

fixed effect, αi, in all of our models to remove bank-level heterogeneity, and cluster standard errors
at the bank level throughout. Some of our tests also incorporate time effects.
We build j measures of bank financial condition based on the 2019 year-end bank Call
Reports. As such, these measures are plausibly exogenous with respect to the COVID-19
pandemic (and any associated market panic), which was not declared by the World Health
Organization until March 11, 2020 (which coincides with the beginning of our Crisis weeks). The
bank financial measures vary only across banks (not over time), so the bank fixed effects fully
absorb their direct effects in Equation (1). The βj coefficients measure the impact of these
conditions on lending during the three-week period in which firms were drawing down their credit
lines, relative to their effects during the normal weeks that preceded it.
We include the following bank-level variables, from the Q4, 2019 bank Call Reports: 1)
Size, equal to the log of total bank assets; 2) Liquid assets, equal to non-interest bearing balances
+ interest-bearing balances + Federal funds sold + Repurchase agreement + held-to-maturity
securities (at amortized cost) + available for sale securities (at fair value); 3) Core deposits (a
measure of funding liquidity), equal to deposits in domestic offices minus deposits over $250,000;
4) Tier 1 capital; and, 5) Unused commitments, equal to undrawn commitments to business. 8 We
normalize each of the on-balance sheet measures (other than log of assets) by total assets; for
Unused commitments, we normalize by the sum of assets plus unused commitments. If banks are
constrained by their asset liquidity, by the availability of stable funds, or by scarce capital, we
would expect those factors to affect lending growth positively.

Lending growth could be

Our measure of capital is close to the regulatory Tier 1 Leverage ratio, although we use the year-end total assets
rather than average total assets as the denominator for consistency with the other variables in the model.

constrained either by reducing new loan originations or by restricting access to liquidity under
existing lines (as occurred during the 2008 crisis). In contrast, if banks hold substantial liquidity
buffers, if their funding is sufficiently abundant, and if they operate sufficiently far from regulatory
minimum capital ratios, then the effects of the pre-crisis financial conditions may not affect lending
growth.
To capture bank-specific variation in exposure to local demand conditions, we incorporate
two strategies. First, we control for the weekly growth in employment, as measured by total hours
worked, at small firms located in the state in which each bank is headquartered.9 These data come
from Homebase, a software provider for small businesses to track employee working hours for
scheduling and payroll. As of January 2020, the Homebase data cover about 60,000 small
businesses across all 50 states. About 90 percent of their clients have fewer than 100 employees.
Homebase covers only a small fraction of total state-level employment, but has concentration in
the leisure, hospitality and retail trade sectors, which are the sectors most hard-hit by the COVID19 crisis. Because this measure comes from very small firms, it is unlikely to be directly affected
by the drawdown behavior, which was dominated by large firms (i.e., it acts as an exogenous
measure of local exposure to the virus; employment patterns at large firms might be affected by
the availability of liquidity, which is our outcome). As a second strategy, we measure the statelevel COVID-19 deaths per capita through the beginning of May 2020, which gives a
comprehensive, cross-sectional measure of the extent of the viral outbreak.10 The bank fixed effect

Alternatively, we use the average weekly growth in employment across states in a bank’s branch network, weighted
by the bank’s deposits in each state, and find similar results.
10
We use death after the end of our sample for two reasons. First, unlike the number of cases, deaths do not depend
on the level of testing, which varies substantially across regions. Hence, it suffers less from measurement error.
Second, deaths are a severely lagging indicator of the extent of the outbreak, so the total number of deaths in May
represents a better measure of the magnitude of the viral outbreak in late March than would contemporaneous
measures.
9

11

captures the cross-sectional effect of this variable, so we focus on its interaction with the Crisis
indicator.11
Panel A of Table 1 reports summary statistics for the full sample of domestic, weekly
reporting banks in FR 2644. We report the distribution for both the change in lending and weekly
growth in hours worked split based on Crisis. Panels B-D of Table 1 report the data sorted into
three size bins: banks with assets below $10 billion; banks with assets between $10 and $50 billion;
and banks with assets above $50 billion.
Table 1 shows the dramatic shift that occurs during the crisis weeks. Pre-crisis, bank
lending increases by only 0.01% of assets per week (with a standard deviation of 0.22% of assets);
during the crisis weeks, bank lending increases by an order of magnitude more (to 0.1% of assets),
while its standard deviation increases by about 70% (to 0.37%). These figures appear ‘small’ only
because we normalize the change in C&I lending by the size of each bank’s balance sheet from
the end of the prior quarter. In fact, the changes in bank C&I lending during these three weeks are
the largest since 1973 (when the FR 2644 data collection began).
Table 1 also shows that as lending explodes, small firm employment declines precipitously.
During the pre-crisis period, weekly hours grew 1.07% per week but then falls by 17.23% during
the crisis period (again, more than an order of magnitude more). The negative effect of the viral
outbreak on local economic activity coincides with the explosion of bank lending because firms,
anticipating future declines in cash flow, immediately draw funds from their bank credit lines when
the effects of the pandemic become evident.

Deaths come from Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE), Johns Hopkins University. State
population comes from World Population Review.

11

12

Panels B-D split the summary statistics based on bank size. This split shows that the largest
banks faced, by far, the greatest increase in liquidity demand. Again, our measure normalizes the
change in lending by the size of the lender’s balance sheet, so the difference in lending in absolute
terms across banks of different sizes is even more striking than at first glance (recall Figure 2). To
be specific, the large banks experienced lending increases of 0.57% of assets per week (Panel B).
In contrast, the small banks experienced lending increases of just 0.06% of assets (Panel D), and
the medium-sized banks experience lending growth of 0.13% of assets (Panel C). Across all three
bank-size bins, lending grew much faster during the crisis weeks, but this increase is most striking
at the largest banks.
Weekly Loan Growth: Linking Lending to Bank Financial Conditions
Tables 2 and 3 report regressions from the weekly FR 2644 data, as in Equation (1). Table
2 reports pooled models, with all of the domestic reporting banks. Some specifications include
only the loan-demand variables (Crisis, two lags of weekly growth in hours worked, their
interactions with Crisis, and the state-level death rate from COVID-19 interacted with Crisis). We
then report specifications that add the pre-crisis bank financial variables (Size, Liquid assets, Core
deposits, Tier 1 capital, and Unused commitments) interacted with Crisis. We omit time effects
from these models so the effects of Crisis and its interactions are well-identified (rather than being
absorbed).
Table 3 then splits the analysis by bank size (<$10 billion in assets, $10-50 billion, and
>$50 billion). In Table 3, we add the time effects to absorb fully the aggregate changes in lending
patterns and thus allay concern about possible omitted variables related to liquidity demand. The

13

models in Table 3 allow us to draw inferences about the impact of banks’ ex ante financial
condition on liquidity supply.
As shown in Table 2, all three types of demand control have strong explanatory power for
loan growth. From column (1): lending increases much faster during the crisis period (consistent
with summary statistics). From column (2): the increase during the crisis period is greater in states
with larger (lagged) declines in weekly hours worked at small firms. The first lag interacts
negatively and significantly with Crisis, and the two lags are jointly statistically significant (pvalue < 0.02). Similarly, the increase in lending is greater during the crisis weeks in states with
more overall death per capita from COVID-19 (columns 4-6).
Table 2, columns 3, 5 and 6 introduce the pre-crisis bank-level variables. Consistent with
the simple summary statistics, Size enters positively and significantly. Large banks face greater
liquidity demands during the crisis weeks. Raising Size by one standard deviation (=1.9) increases
weekly lending by about 0.04% of assets. The Unused commitments variable is by far the strongest
predictor of weekly lending increases. This result validates the premise of the paper, which is that
the increase in lending comes primarily from liquidity demands in which businesses draw funds
from their pre-existing credit lines once the effects of the pandemic become clear. The economic
magnitude of this variable is large: a standard deviation increase in Unused commitments (=0.04)
comes with an increase in lending of 0.14% of assets, or about one-third of a standard deviation of
lending growth during the crisis weeks (=0.37%; see Table 1, Panel A). We also find that both
Asset liquidity and Tier 1 capital correlate positively with lending. These results suggest that
financial condition may have constrained bank lending (although both variables are strongly
correlated with bank size).

14

Table 3 separates the analysis by bank size. Two things stand out from this sample split.
First, the effect of Unused commitments, while positive across all three samples, is much larger
and more statistically significant for the largest banks. For banks with assets over $50 billion, a
standard deviation increase in Unused commitments (=0.07; see Table 1, Panel B) leads to an
increase in lending of 0.48% of assets (=0.07 x 0.068). This increase equals about two-thirds of a
standard deviation of the outcome during the crisis week (=0.72% of assets; see Table 1, Panel B).
Second, once we separate the sample by size, the effects of the three financial condition measures
– Liquid assets, Core deposits, and Tier 1 capital – lose statistical power. We find no effect for
the largest banks for any of these measures. For the medium-sized banks, Tier 1 capital enters
with a marginally significant positive coefficient; for the small banks, Asset liquidity enters with a
marginally significant positive coefficient. Taken together, these results offer almost no support
for the idea that bank financial conditions constrained their ability to supply liquidity during the
crisis weeks.
Quarterly Increases in Lending: Empirical Model & Data
The results from the weekly FR 2644 reporting banks have two limitations. First, we
cannot separate new loan originations from drawdowns on pre-existing loan commitments because
the change in loans on bank balance sheet equals the sum of net drawdowns on existing credit lines
plus new originations. We have argued that the variation we observe in these data reflect
drawdowns (not originations), but we cannot demonstrate that claim directly because we do not
observe the off-balance sheet changes in the weekly data. Second, the FR 2644 sample does not
include all banks.

15

To remedy these two defects, we look next at quarterly Call Report data. We have seen
that the vast bulk of C&I lending changes during the Q1, 2020 come during the three crisis weeks
in March. Hence, the total quarterly changes in lending (both on and off the balance sheet) will
provide a good measure of banks’ response to the crisis. So, we estimate the following two
equations:
ΔC&I Loansi,t/Assetsi,t-1 = γt + αi + ΣµjBank Financial Conditionji,t-1
+ ΣβjCrisist*Bank Financial Conditionji,t-1 + εi,t ,

(2a)

and:
Δ(C&I Loans+Undrawn Commit.)i,t/(Assets+Undrawn Commit.)i,t-1 = γt + αi + ΣµjBank
Financial Conditionji,t-1 + ΣβjCrisist*Bank Financial Conditionji,t-1 + εi,t .

(2b)

Equation (2a) is similar to Equation (1). We model the change in total C&I lending on the balance
sheet of bank i in quarter t, normalized by lagged total assets. The sample includes all domestic
banks and uses the eight quarters of 2018 and 2019 to pin down the ‘normal’ effect of bank
condition on lending prior to the onset of the pandemic.12 The time fixed effects, γt, capture the
overall demand in each quarter and thus capture the overall shock observed in Q1, 2020. We leave
out the location-specific measures of demand because these are not well-defined during the precrisis quarters. To construct standard errors, again we cluster by bank.
Unlike Equation (1), the bank fixed effects, αi, do not fully absorb the ‘normal’ effects of
the financial variables, as these exhibit within-bank variation over time. Hence, we include them
in the regression, with their effect prior to the crisis captured by the µj coefficients. As in Equation

12

In contrast, the weekly analysis uses the weeks of Q1, 2020 before the liquidity spike as the ‘control’ regime.

16

(1), the βj coefficients capture the differential effect of bank financial condition during the crisis
quarter relative to normal times.

If bank financial conditions constrain their ability to

accommodate the liquidity demand shock from the pandemic, the βj coefficients will enter
Equation (2a) with positive and significant effects. Equation (2b) allows us to estimate similar
models using total credit production – the sum of on- and off-balance sheet lending commitments
to businesses.
Table 4 reports summary statistics for the Call Report data, again looking at all banks first
and then at banks in each of three size bins. We report these statistics separately for the crisis and
pre-crisis quarters. Looking at the full sample (Panel A), on-balance sheet lending does not show
any difference between Q1, 2020 and the earlier quarters. This masks very large differences,
however, in the aggregates because the large banks were much more affected than the smaller
ones. Consistent with the weekly data, large banks experienced much faster loan growth in Q1,
2020 than during the earlier quarters (Panel B). For them, loans grew by 0.2% of assets at the
mean of the distribution prior to the crisis; in Q1, 2020, however, C&I loans grow 1.7% of assets
at the mean. This difference, however, is not evident in total credit production (loans on balance
sheets plus undrawn commitments), which is slightly lower during the crisis quarter for all banks
and slightly higher for the largest banks. These patterns support our claim that credit-line
drawdowns dominate changes in lending during the crisis.13 Firms demand liquidity from preexisting credit lines, as opposed to demanding new credit to facilitate growth or new investment.
All else equal, each dollar drawdown leads to a dollar increase in loans on bank balance sheets but
no change in total credit (=loans + undrawn commitments).

13

The increase in lending was also much too massive and abrupt to have been driven by new loan originations,
which require substantial time for negotiation of pricing and contract terms.

17

Quarterly Increases in Lending: Results
Tables 5 & 6 report the estimates of Equations (2a) and (2b) using the nine quarters from
the beginning of 2018 through the first quarter of 2020.
The results in Table 5 are fully consistent with those from Table 3, despite the fact that
Table 5 uses all banks (rather than a subset), uses a different pre-crisis benchmark (all of 2018 and
2019, rather than the first weeks of Q1, 2020), and has no cross-state control for the level of the
viral outbreak.
In particular, as in Table 3, the growth in lending in Q1, 2020 is best explained by the level
of pre-existing business loan commitments. The effect of pre-existing commitments is much larger
for the largest banks, and the magnitudes line up very closely with those from the weekly analysis.
For example, the coefficient on Unused commitments for the largest banks equals 0.068 at weekly
frequency (Table 3, column 2). This coefficient is ‘turned on’ for three weeks during Q1, 2020,
so the total effect on lending over the quarter equals 3x0.068 = 0.204. This effect is very close to
the coefficient estimated on the interaction of the Crisis x Unused Commitments from Table 5 of
0.195 (column 2). Moreover, as with the weekly data, there is very little evidence that bank
financial conditions affect changes in lending. We estimate a positive effect of Crisis x Tier 1
capital for the small banks (column 4), but this effect is only marginally significant.
Table 6 reports estimates of Equation (2b), where the outcome captures total credit
production to businesses. This variable is not affected by credit line drawdowns, only by overall
changes in credit originations. We find no correlation between Crisis x Unused Commitments and
credit production, either for the full sample or for any size-based subsample. Consistent with Table
5, there is little evidence that this broader measure of credit production is constrained by bank
18

financial condition. Again, we see a marginally significant positive coefficient on Crisis x Tier 1
capital for the small banks, as well as marginally significant positive coefficient on Crisis x Core
deposits. Neither of these, nor asset liquidity, has a significant effect on total credit production for
the medium-sized or large banks.
Discussion
We have analyzed how banks have accommodated the unprecedented increase in liquidity
demands in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Pre-existing unused loan commitments
explain the majority of the variation in lending, especially for large banks. Yet we see almost no
correlation between bank financial strength and their willingness to bear this liquidity shock. The
shock is the largest ever observed, going all the way back to 1973. It is larger than anything
observed during the 2008 crisis, when financial condition of banks did constrain lending. How is
this possible? We suspect that changes in the regulatory regime after the 2008 crisis, inflows of
deposits, and the Federal Reserve’s aggressive actions in response to the pandemic, explain our
results.
Increases in bank liquidity has been a mechanical side effect of the massive expansion of
the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet from Quantitative Easing (QE), as it effectively expands the
supply of excess reserves. The Fed began expanding the supply of reserves in September of 2019,
and then announced a massive expansion of QE in response to the pandemic on March 15, 2020.
At the same time, the Fed also expanded and reinstated lending programs to banks and other large
financial institutions constructed during the 2008 crisis.

The policy moves were timely –

expanding liquidity supply from the central bank just as non-financial firms were drawing liquidity
from their banks.

19

At the same time that liquidity supplied by the Fed expanded, it also expanded from private
sources. Deposits flowed rapidly into banks, again at just the same time that liquidity demands
spiked. Figure 4 graphs the aggregate flow of deposits into U.S. banks from the beginning of
March 2020, compared to the increase in total C&I lending. As the figure shows, for every $1 of
new lending, there is about $2 of additional deposits. Deposits increased by almost $1 trillion
during the three weeks from March 11 to April 1. Hence, liquidity poured into banks at exactly
the right time, both from the public sector and the private sector. This coincident increase in
liquidity supply to banks, when most needed by their borrowers, is consistent with earlier episodes
(e.g., Kashyap, Rajan and Stein, 2002; Gatev and Strahan, 2006).
Our results also suggest that capital did not constrain banks during this COVID-19 crisis.
As we show, the largest banks faced by far the greatest increases in liquidity demands. But these
banks also experienced the greatest increase in regulatory capital from the post-2008 changes in
regulation. Innovations such as stress testing and additional capital buffers required for the
systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) moved the largest banks well above minimum
capital requirements (Schneider, Yang, and Strahan, 2020). These regulatory innovations, while
controversial, seem to have succeeded in building a sufficiently thick capital cushion to allow
banks to bear this liquidity shock. That said, the longer-term effect of the increased credit exposure
on bank solvency is impossible to assess until more time has passed.

III. CONCLUSION
We have shown that liquidity demands on the large U.S. banks reached unprecedented
levels during late March 2020. Firms went to their banks for cash, drawing funds from pre-existing
20

credit lines and loan commitments, in anticipation of massive declines in future cash flow from
the oncoming economic shutdown. Large banks experienced the lion’s share of these liquidity
demands. Banks met the demand without running into binding financial constraints. We suggest
two reasons for this. First, bank liquidity and bank solvency buffers were both substantially more
robust before the COVID-19 crisis than they were before the 2008 crisis. Second, aggregate
liquidity supply, from both the Federal Reserve and from depositors, flowed in at exactly the right
time.
