    "abstract": "\n\nI study age discrimination in hiring, exploiting a difference between age-revealed and partially age-blind hiring procedures.  Under the first hiring procedure, age is revealed simultaneously with other applicant information and job offer rates are much lower for older than for younger job applicants.  Under the second hiring procedure, interview selections are based on detailed, age-blind on-line applications, while subsequent interviews are not age-blind.  Older applicants are not under-selected for interviews, but after in-person interviews when age is revealed, older applicants still face a much lower job offer rate.  This evidence is strongly consistent with age discrimination in hiring.\n\n",

The views expressed herein are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\n\n\nDavid Neumark\n\nThe data studied in this paper come from a discrimination case on which I worked as an expert witness (on the plaintiff's side).  I was paid on an hourly basis, and hence had no financial stake in the outcome of the case.\n\n\n"
