    "abstract": "\n\nWe present a new model of asset prices in which investors evaluate risk according to prospect theory and examine its ability to explain 23 prominent stock market anomalies. The model incorporates all the elements of prospect theory, takes account of investors\u2019 prior gains and losses, and makes quantitative predictions about an asset\u2019s average return based on empirical estimates of its volatility, skewness, and past capital gain. We \ufb01nd that the model is helpful for thinking about a majority of the 23 anomalies.\n\n",
