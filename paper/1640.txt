Are Imports to Blame?:
Attribution of Injury Under
the 1974 Trade Act

ABSTRACT

Under Section 201 of the 1974 Trade Act, a domestic industry can obtain
temporary protection against imports by demonstrating before the International
Trade Commission that it has been injured, and that imports have been the
"substantial cause" of injury ——
"a cause which is important and not
less than any other cause." To date, the ITC lacks a coherent framework for
selecting a menu of other factors which might be considered as causes of
injury, and for weighing the effects of these other factors against those of
imports.

i.e.,

This paper sets forth a straightforward economic and statistical framework
for use in Section 201 cases. This framework is based on the fact that if the
domestic industry is competitive, injury can arise from one or more of three
broad sources: adverse shifts in market demand, adverse shifts in domestic
supply, or increased imports. We show how these sources of injury can be
distinguished in theory, and statistically evaluated in practice. As an
illustrative example, we apply the framework to the case of the copper
industry, which petitioned the ITC for relief in 1984. Although that industry
has indeed suffered injury, we show that the "substantial cause" was not
imports, but instead increasing costs and decreasing demand.

1. Introduction
Under Section 201 of the 1974 Trade Act, a domestic industry can obtain
temporary protection against imports by demonstrating first, that it has been
injured, and second, that increased imports have been a substantial cause of

injury.1 Protection under the Act might take the form of a quota or tariff
lasting for a period of five years, during which time the industry would
presumably have an opportunity to make the adjustments necessary to strengthen

its competitive international position. To obtain protection, the industry must

make its case before the International Trade Commission (ITC). The findings and
recommendations of the ITC are then reviewed by the President, who makes the
final decision as to whether relief is warranted, and the form it will take.
Determining that an industry has been injured is relatively easy —--

the

ITC

can look to such indicators as reduced profits, plant closings, falling

employment, and the like. What is much more difficult is determining whether
imports, rather than one or more other factors, is the substantial cause of the
injury, ——
cause."

i.e.,

"a cause which is important and not less than any other

2

Yet the ITC must make this determination regularly in the growing

number of cases brought before it each year. To date, the ITC lack a coherent
framework for selecting a menu of other factors which might be considered as
causes of injury, and for weighing the effects of these other factors against
those of imports.

This paper sets forth a straightforward economic and statistical framework

for use in Section 201 cases. This framework is based on the fact that if the
domestic industry is competitive, injury can arise from one or more of three

broad sources: adverse shifts in market demand, adverse shifts in domestic
supply, or increased imports. We show how these sources of injury can be
distinguished in theory, and statistically evaluated in practice.

—1

Before addressing any issues of measurement, an interpretation must be made

of the economic meaning of Section 201. To an economist, the view that increased
imports cause injury is itself problematic. In many economic models the
fundamental determinants of prices and output levels are tastes and technological
possibilities, and imports are only one of the many consequences of these

fundamental determinants. Changes in welfare then come about because of changes
in tastes and technological possibilities, so that imports could never be a

source of injury. This view, however, is hardly in keeping with the spirit and
intent of the Trade Act.

An alternative view might focus on the distinction between domestic and

foreign shifts in tastes and technological possibilities. It would attribute the

deleterious effects of any shifts of foreign origin to imports. However, it
would not treat as injurious any changes in imports due to shifts of domestic

origin. This might seem appealing in that the domestic effects of foreign shifts
are mediated through changes in imports. According to this view, the intent of
the Trade Act is to insulate the domestic industry only from foreign

developments. This view is adopted by Grossman in a recent paper evaluating the
injurious effects of steel imports.3
We reject this view, however, on grounds of both implementation and

interpretation. First, consider implementation. The equilibrium level of
imports is also affected by domestic shifts in tastes and technologies.
Therefore, in order to calculate changes in industry welfare resulting from
changes in imports in a way consistent with this view, one must be able to
separate the changes in imports into two parts —— those due to domestic and those

due to foreign developments. This is likely to be difficult in practice, as will

become clear later. (Grossman avoided this separation by assuming the supply of
imports is infinitely price elastic, an assumption that is extreme and

—2—

unrealistic.) As for the interpretation of the Trade Act, it only refers to
damage from imports. It never distinguishes between the sources of increased
imports.

The view that we adopt is to take

changes in imports as possible causes

of injury, regardless of the sources of those changes. An advantage of this

approach is that the injury from domestic developments is computed as if the

indu8try were not subject to import competition. Moreover, this view is in
keeping with the language of the Trade Act, and as we will see, it permits a
straightforward measurement and comparison of the injuries caused by imports, and
those caused by domestic developments.

Our approach is to begin with any shifts in domestic demand, shifts in
domestic supply, and changes in imports that might have occurred since some base

period, and determine their relative impacts on the industry. We assign injury
to increased imports by comparing actual industry performance (as measured by
such indicia as profits, employment, output, etc.) with performance under a

hypothetical "constant import" scenario. Under this scenario, all domestic
industry variables (e.g. wages, demand, etc.) have their actual values, but
imports are held at their base level (e.g., by imposition of a quota or tariff).
With imports held constant in this way, domestic developments alone can still

cause a certain amount of injury. The difference between actual

industry

performance and performance under the constant import scenario is the injury that

can be attributed to imports. This injury can then be compared with the injury
caused by domestic developments alone.

The next section of this paper sets forth an accounting framework for the

attribution of injury. Statistical issues involved in the application of this
framework are discussed in Section 3. As an illustrative example, Section 4
applies the framework to the case of the copper industry which petitioned the ITC

—3—

for relief in l984. Although that industry has indeed suffered injury, we
show that the "substantial cause" was not imports, but instead increasing costs
and decreasing demand.

As explained above, our framework treats any changes in imports as possible

causes of injury. Section 5 shows how one can test for "substantial cause" under
the alternative framework in which only changes in imports resulting from foreign
shifts in tastes and technologies are included as possible causes of injury.
Section 6 provides a summary, and some concluding remarks.

2. Theoretical Framework
Injury to a domestic industry might have the following causes, which could

occur individually or in combination: a drop in domestic demand, an adverse
shift in supply (corresponding, say, to increases in costs), or an increase in

imports. The problem is to separate these causes and measure their relative
contributions. We do this as follows.
We will assume that the domestic industry is competitive.5 Then we can
write the domestic supply schedule as S(P,a), where P is price, and a is a shift

parameter. Increases in a shift the supply schedule to the right. For example,
technological progress in the U.S. would increase a, and increase supply, while

rising labor costs in the U.S. would have the opposite effect. Similarly, we can
write the domestic demand schedule as D(P,b), where increases in the parameter b
(corresponding, say, to an increase in U.S. income levels) increase demand.

The U.S. also faces an import supply schedule M(P,c). This schedule is
upward sloping; a higher price creates an incentive for foreign producers to
increase production and an incentive for foreign consumers to reduce consumption,

in both cases making more imports available to the U.S. The shift parameter c
reflects changes in foreign supply and demand conditions, with aM/sc > 0.

—4—

For example, a recession abroad would reduce foreign demand, thereby increasing
M, so we would represent such a recession by an increase in c.
The U.S. and world markets are in equilibrium when price equates demand and

total supply, i.e., at a price * such that:
S(P*,a) +

D(P*,b)

M(P*,c)

(i)

An equilibrium of this type is illustrated by Figures la and lb. Observe from
the figures that changes in a and b will affect the equilibrium price *, and
thus the level of imports, even though the import supply schedule M(P,c) remains

fixed. Thus, the level of imports can change purely as a result of domestic

developments. For example, an increase in domestic labor costs (i.e., a drop in
a) would shift S(P,a) to the left, increasing * and increasing imports.
This raises the problem of interpretation of Section 201 discussed in the

Introduction. The alternative view (which we reject) is that the only increases
in imports that should be deemed to have caused injury are those resulting from
increases in c ——

i.e.,

from shifts to the right of the import supply

schedule.6 The view we adopt is to include any changes in imports as possible
sources of injury, no matter how those changes arise, and compare their effects
to those from shifts in the domestic demand or supply schedules.

Let us begin with the equilibrium given by eqn. (1), and consider the effect
of a change in a ——

i.e.

a shift in the domestic supply schedule. From eqn. (1)

we see that this will result in the following change in price:
—
dP/da -

________S/a

(2)

aD/a? -aS/aP -

and the following total change in domestic supply:

(dS/da)T

aS/aa +
— a

S a +

(aS/aP)(dP/da)
(as/aP)(as/ba

(aD/ap— as/ar

—5

—

M/BP)

(3)

This is illustrated in Figures 2a and 2b, which show the effect of a decrease in

a to a', corresponding to say an increase in domestic production cost. Observe
that price increases from P to P1, bringing forth the higher level of imports
M1, with domestic supply falling to S1.

Now suppose that imports had been held constant at M, say through a
quota. Then the change in price would be:

dP/da =

3 S/3 a

(3D/ap — 3S/3P)

(14)

Because of this larger change in price, there is a smaller change in supply.
This "constant import" change in domestic supply is given by:
(a

(dS/da) = 3 S/cia +

P) (3 S/a a)

75P—as/aP)

(5)

As shown in Figure 2a, with imports held at M, price rises to P2 and

domestic supply only falls to S.?.

Thus, the total change in domestic output (ST) resulting from changing
domestic cost conditions can be decomposed into two components: a change for
constant imports (AS), and a change due purely to the shift in imports

(Ls). This latter change is given by:

(dS/da) = (dS/da) — (dS/da)

as/3P — 3M/aP)(3D/3P — as/ap)

In Figure 2a, S is given by S —

(6)

S2, and 1S is given by S2— S1.

Observe that if demand is relatively inelastic (3D/3P is small) and the

import supply schedule is relative elastic (3M/3P is large), S can

exceed S .

m

(That is the case in Figure 2a.) In the extreme case of a

completely inelastic demand schedule, supply would not change at all if imports

were absent. It is only the responsiveness of imports to a price increase that
makes a fall in a detrimental to output in the industry.

—6—

Now we must deal with the meaning and measurement of injury. The Trade Act
is explicit in including only domestic producers among the possibly injured, as

opposed to consumers. A narrow economic view might therefore limit injury to the
loss of producer surplus, i.e. economic profits and rents. In general, profits,
output, capacity utilization, and price will be highly correlated with this

measure, and would represent sensible indicia of industry welfare. So, too, is
the level of employment, if workers who lose their jobs are unable to obtain

alternative employment at the same wage. Indeed, the Trade Act refers to all of
these variables as measures of industry welfare.
Let us denote these indicia of injury by I, and consider what I might depend

on. If the parameter a is constant, it is clear that injury can result only from

a fall in the equilibrium price P that affects supply. (For example, a drop in
demand would reduce p*) However, a reduction in a itself will also cause
injury.7 In general, one can therefore write the value of I as a function of S
and a:
I =

g(S(P*,a),a)

(7)

Observe that I rises as either a or S falls. The effect on I of a change in
a can be decomposed into a "direct" effect, ag/a, and an "indirect" effect,

given by 3gIS times the change in S induced by the change in a. The "direct"
effect is the injury that would result even if prices somehow adjusted to keep

supply constant. The "indirect" effect is the injury resulting from the change
in the equilibrium quantity supplied. Thus the total injury is given by
ag/aa +

(agIaS)(asI3a),

while that attributable to imports is given by

(ag/as)(as/aa) n

A similar analysis can be carried out with respect to a change in B. A
recession—induced drop in domestic demand (a drop in b) will cause injury by

reducing price and output. However, the fall in price will bring about a drop in

—7—

imports, which will mitigate the reduction in output. Now imports benefit the
domestic industry; the total injury from a drop in demand is less than it would
be had imports been held fixed.

Finally, note that a change in c (a shift in the import supply schedule) only

has effects on the domestic industry via its effects on the level of imports. As
shown in Figures 3a and 3b, an increase in c causes injury by increasing M, and
thereby reducing price and domestic output.

3. Statistical Approach.
In assessing injury the ITC reviews data pertaining to some recent time

period, usually the past five years. During such a period there are likely to
have been shifts in all three schedules, S(P,a), D(P,b), and M(P,c), and as a
result changes in such observable variables as price, domestic output, and the

level of imports. We now show how such data can be used to allocate injury
between imports and domestic developments.
We assume that time series of data are available for the indicia of injury,

the level of imports Mt, as well as any

which we denote at time t by

variables that shift the supply and demand schedules, at and bt. For
simplicity, we assume that the relationships embodied in eqns. (1) and (7) are

linear; this is always valid at least as a local approximation.8 Then we can
write supply, demand, and the indicia of injury at time t as:

where the parameters i' 82, and d1 are positive, while

d2, i1, and i2

are negative. The C's are residuals (additive errors); they emerge because of the
myriad influences on supply, demand, and injury which cannot be captured by

the variables we can measure. Now, substituting (8a) and (8b) for supply and
demand into eqn. (1), we obtain the following for the equilibrium price:

Eqn. (9) can be substituted for

Eqn. (10) is a reduced
alternative sources of

form regression equation which we use

injury, as captured by

to gauge the

a, bt, and Mt. First,

however, we must determine whether consistent parameter estimates can he obtained
using ordinary least squares.

The first requirement is that the included variables which shift supply arid
demand (at and bt) not be correlated with the excluded variables embodied in
the residual Ct. Variables typically part of a are wage levels and other

input prices, and these are unlikely to have any direct effect on demand.
Similarly, variables that shift demand, such as aggregate income, are unlikely to

have any significant effect on supply. But even if a were correlated with
eqn. (10) would still provide a valid gauge of the sources of injury.

—9—

Although the estimate of a could not be used to recover the underlying

structural parameters i1, i, etc., it would still be a consistent estimate of
the partial correlation of a with the index of injury. This represents the extent
to which an increase in a, when unaccompanied by any other change, affects I.

A second requirement is that imports Mt not be correlated with .

This

is

more problematic if imports are highly price elastic. In this case, as eqn. (9)

shows, an increase in ed or decrease in c5 raises price and increases imports
substantially. Since increases in either Cdt or

imports price elastic M and

decrease c, with

could be either positively or negatively

correlated. This in turn could bias the estimated value of 5 in either
direction. In principle, this can be corrected by the use of instrumental

variables. One needs instruments that are correlated with M but not with

Cdt

and c. Past values of imports would have this property, but only if
and Edt are serially uncorrelated.
Once a, 13, i4), and

have been estimated, eqn. (10) can be used to compute

the effects on the indicia of injury of the measured changes in a, b, and M from

their base levels. That provides a direct comparision of the injury due to
import changes with that due to domestic developments.

The procedure described above has the advantage of using the available data

to gauge alternative sources of injury as accurately as possible. A limitation,
however, is that it ignores dynamic adjustments in the response of market

variables to changes in imports and other variables. For example, the response
of price and domestic production to a shift in the import supply schedule is
likely to occur with time lags, and those lags are not captured by eqn. (10).

In

theory, one could specify and estimate a detailed structural model that captures
those lags, but given the limited amounts of data that are usually available,

this is likely to be difficult or impossible in practice. We also suggest an

— 10 —

alternative procedure that allows for the possibility of dynamic adjustment.
Unfortunately this procedure can only be used to determine whether imports and
other variables have had any injurious effects at all, but cannot be used to

measure the sizes of those effects. Thus, this procedure would be used to
complement the one described earlier.

This alternative uses the test of causality introduced by Cranger.9 It is
a test of the null hypothesis that a particular variable does not help predict

some other variable. In particular, the variable x does not help predict the
variable y if, in a regression of y against past values of y, the addition of
past values of x as independent variables does not contribute significantly to

the explanatory power of the regression. In such case, the data are not
inconsistent with a relatively small role for x in the prediction or explanation
of y.

10

The application of this notion to the problem at hand involves running a
regression explaining the value of an index of injury at t by past values of the

index as well as present and lagged values of imports. If imports are
statistically insignificant in that regression, then one can accept the

hypothesis that they did not cause injury, or more accurately, that any injury

they did cause is not statistically detectable)1 This is a stronger test for
lack of injury than discovering from the estimaLlon Oi eqn. iL'i tnat 0 Is
insignificantly different from zero, because it allows the effects of imports to
occur with a lag.

4. The United States Copper Industry.
The early 1980's was a period of severe contraction for the U.S. copper

industry. Copper prices fell dramatically, and many domestic mining operations
became unprofitable, leading to mine closings, reduced output and employment, and

a sharp decline in profitability. Domestic producers blamed this on rising

— 11 —

imports of refined and blister copper, and petitioned the ITC for relief.12

Although there is little doubt that injury indeed occurred, our analysis using
the framework described above shows that imports are not a "substantial cause."
Instead, we find that most of the injury can be attributed to two much more

important factors: high and rising domestic costs, and a decline in demand.
Our analysis has two parts. First, we estimate eqn. (10) for several indicia
of injury, and using the resulting parameters, compare the relative contributions

of changes in imports, costs, and demand on each index. Second, we conduct
Granger causality tests to determine whether changes in imports "caused" changes

in either copper prices, or the profits of copper mining firms. Here we briefly
summarize our results.

We estimate eqn. (10) for the following indicia of injury — domestic copper
refinery production, domestic smelter production, domestic mine production, and

domestic copper mining employment.13 Independent variables in these
regressions include (i) the level or real GNP in the U.S. (a variable that shifts
the demand for copper), (ii) the ratio of average hourly earnings for U.S. copper
mining employees14 to average hourly earnings for all U.S. manufacturing
employees (a variable that shifts supply), (iii) a time trend to capture the
effects of productivity growth, the gradual tightening of environmental
regulations, and the gradual substitution of other materials (plastics, aluminum,
and fiber optics) for copper over the sample period, and (iv) the level of
15

imports.

These regressions are estimated by ordinary least squares using annual data

for 1950—83, and the results are shown in Table 1. Observe that all of the
parameter estimates have the expected signs, and except in the equation for
mining employment, all but the time trend are significant at the 95% level or

above. Reestimation of these regressions by two—stage least squares has no
material effect on the relative magnitudes of the parameter estimates.
— 12 —

One might argue that net imports, i.e. imports less exports, is a more
appropriate independent variable than imports alone, and we reestimate the

regressions accordingly. These results are also shown in Table 1, and are
substantially the same as the first set of regressions. Finally, one could also
argue that downstream imports is the appropriate independent variable. (For
example, imports of semi—fabricated products will reduce the demand for

domestically produced refined copper just as will imports of refined copper.) We
therefore reestimate the regressions adding downstream imports to the import

variables at each stage of processing. These results also appear in Table 1, and
again are substantially the same.

The parameter estimates in Table 1 can be used to quantify the effects of
changes in a given independent variable on each index of injury. To do this,
however, one must compare the actual value of the independent variable in a given

year to some meaningful reference value. We use the following reference values.
For real GNP, we take the average annual growth rate for 1959—79, and use
this to generate a series of projected (or "full—capacity") values for subsequent

years. Our proxy measure for the shift in demand then is the difference between
projected and actual GNP in each year. For the wage ratio, we take 1969 as a
reference ——

the last year of a period of relatively uninterrupted prosperity,

and the year that preceeds a decade of wage—price controls, recessions, and
energy shocks that should have produced a relative decline in the real wages of

copper mining employees. We then use the difference between the actual wage
ratio and its 1969 value as a measure of increased cost. Finally, our reference
value for imports of refined copper is 300,000 short tons, or 272,160 metric tons
(the quota recommended by the ITC in 1978), and for imports of blister, zero, so
that any blister imports are treated as "increased imports" in our calculations.
Actual and reference values are presented in Table 2 for the years 1981—1983.

— 13 —

To calculate the relative impacts of the recession—induced decline in demand,
the increase in the wage ratio, and the increase in refined and blister imports,
we multiply the difference between the reference and actual values of each

variable by the parameter estimates in Parts A and B of Table 1. The results are
shown in Table 3 where the relative impact of each variable in each year is

measured relative to the impact of the wage ratio.
As Table 3 shows, for each index of injury and in each year, low CNP and high
real wages each had a greater impact than increases in imports, and in most

instances a much greater impact. In 1981, for example, real wage increases had

by far the greatest impact on the industry. In fact, the parameter estimates in
Table 1 imply that had real wages in copper mining remained stable relative to
the wages in all manufacturing, domestic production at each stage of the industry
would have been 350,000 — 675,000 tons higher. Had there been no increases in
imports on the other hand, domestic production would have been only 55,000 to

100,000 tons higher. In 1982 refined imports were below the ITC's proposed quota
of 272,160 metric tons, and blister imports clearly had a miniscule effect

relative to the other variables. The parameter estimates of Table I imply that
the combined effects of the recession and increased real wage caused production
to decline by 650,000 to 1,000,000 tons at every stage of processing, and caused

employment to decline by roughly 20,000 workers. Even in 1983, when imports
rose, demand and wages contributed significantly more to the changes that

occurred in each index of injury. Based on these results, imports hardly seem a
"substantial cause" of injury to the domestic copper industry.

Conceivably the effects of imports occur with lags not captured by the model

of eqn. (10). We therefore examine the relationship over time between imports
and an additional index of industry welfare, price. Using the notion of Cranger
causality, we test the null hypothesis that changes in imports have not caused
16

changes in prices.
— 14 —

To perform this test, we use data for the U.S.

producer

price of refined

copper, deflated by the PPI for all commodities, and U.S. imports for consumption

U.S. producer prices.

This causality test complements the regression results shown in Tables 1 to

these results provide strong evidence that imports have not been a

cause of injury to the U.S. copper industry.

5. Statistical Implications of Alternative Interpretation of Section 201.
As explained in the Introduction, an alternative interpretation of Section
201 is that changes in imports are considered to cause injury only when they are
due to shifts in the import supply schedule (i.e., changes in the parameter c).
We rejected this interpretation because it requires that changes in the observed
level of imports be divided into changes due to domestic developments and changes

due to foreign developments (where only the latter are injurious). This is
difficult to do in practice, and seems in conflict with the wording of the Trade

Act. Nonetheless, since others may use this interpretation when assessing
injury,17 we discuss the statistical issues involved in its implementation.
The simplest approach is to directly estimate the effects of changes in a, b,

and c on the indicia of injury. This can be done by estimating the reduced form
regression equation:

— 15 —

= ' + a'a

+ 13'bt + ó'c +

(11)

The coefficients in this regression directly measure the effects of a, b, and c
on I.

Note, however, that a' and 13' differ from a and t3 in that the former

also account for the iudirect injury caused by the endogenous response of imports
to changes in a and b.

Unfortunately, the use of eqn. (11) has two related disadvantages. First,
imports, the key variable in Section 201, does not appear explicitly. Second,
the equation does not make use of the fact that all of the injury resulting from
changes in c is mediated through changes in imports, i.e., it does not make full
use of all available information.

18

Thus a better approach is to estimate eqn.

(10) together with an equation explaining the level of imports:

Mt = m0 + miat + m2bt + m3ct +

(12)

where m, m1, etc., are parameters and the fl's are residuals, then the
effects of changes in a, b, and c, are given by (a + (Sm1), (13 + (Sm2),
and (Sm3 respectively.

If c is uncorrelated with excluded domestic variables which affect I,
t

there

is an additional advantage to estimating (10) and (12) simultaneously.

Suppose that M and

in eqn. (10) are correlated, so that an estimate of (S

from that equation is biased. This bias can be reduced by treating M as an
endogenous variable in the system of equations (10) and (12). This amounts to
treating the variables represented by c as instruments for M.

There are two difficulties with this procedure. First, any changes in
imports not explained by eqn. (12), i.e., the n's, are neither attributed to
domestic nor to foreign developments, and there is no a priori grounds for

attributing them in total to either. This, of course, brings us back to the
fundamental problem with this interpretation of Section 201; in practice it is
impossible to make a complete division of changes in imports into those due to

— 16

—

domestic and those due to foreign developments. A second difficulty is that
this procedure requires data on c, which is likely to be much more difficult
to obtain than data on a and b.
An alternative procedure is to estimate only the effects of a and b on
imports, and attribute the remainder of the changes in imports to changes in

c. This involves estimation of the parameters n, n1, and n2 in:
Mt = no +

niat

+

n2bt + nnt

Now the effects of changes in a and b are given by (a +

respectively.

(13)

and

(f3 +

Any change in N not explained by a and b in (13) can be attributed

to c, and then multiplied by ó to yield an estimate of the extent of injury due
to changes in "imports."

This procedure is also somewhat flawed, however. If a and b are positively
correlated with c, eqn. (13) will attribute too much of the variation in M to a

and b. On the other hand, because the entire residual in (13) is attributed to
changes in c, the procedure overstates the importance of c by attributing to it

all of the changes in M that are in fact due to excluded domestic variables. As
a result, the use of (13) can make the division of import changes into those due
to domestic and those due to foreign developments even more problematic.
This discussion should help to clarify why the implementation of this
interpretation of Section 201 would be difficult, if not impossible, in

practice. Consider the case of copper imports discussed earlier. Since there is
no meaningful data available for c, one cannot estimate eqn. (11), and must
instead use the alternative procedure, i.e., estimate (10) together with (13) as

a simultaneous system. But as we have seen, the result will be a highly
imperfect division of import changes into domestic versus foreign sources, and
thus a possibly biased estimate of injury.

6. Conclusions.
This paper has presented an economic and statistical framework for the

attribution of injury under Section 201 of the 1974 Trade Act. Using this
framework, one can evaluate the relative impacts on an industry of imports versus
shifts in domestic demand and supply, and thereby determine whether imports are a

"substantial cause" of injury, as required by the Act. We have also shown how
one can test whether imports have had any deleterious effect at all.
As this paper has shown, the attribution of injury in Section 201 cases is in

principle a straightforward task. In practice there are naturally problems which

arise. The main one is that statistical analyses using different data and
different specifications can lead to different results in borderline cases. But
it is in just such cases that the methods presented here are particularly

useful. The reason is that they focus attention on precisely those issues which
ought to be resolved when deciding such cases.

For example, if the petitioner in a Section 201 case presents a dynamic
version of eqn. (10) and the respondent does not, then the industry's dynamics

may well be important in understanding the causation of injury. Although
assessing the role of dynamics may be difficult to do, it is probably just the

issue that the ITC should ponder in such a case. The economic and statistical
framework presented here may help to focus such pondering, and make it more
productive.

its hearings in May 1984. See Robert S. Pindyck and Julio J. Rotemberg,
"Economic and Statistical Analysis of Injury Causation," presented to the
International Trade Commission, Investigation No. TA—201—52, Unwrought

Codelco, the state—owned copper company of Chile.

5. This simplifies the analysis considerably. If domestic firms had significant
monopoly power (by virtue of concentration or collusion), there would be no
well—defined domestic supply schedule.

report on copper to the ITC. (Unwrought Copper, supra)

another input is likely to have a greater impact on

8. One might think that a globally valid linear formulation can be obtained when
all variables are in logarithms, but this is not the case. With Cobb—Douglas
production functions the log of employment is a linear function of the log of
output. Similarly, the log of output is a linear function of the log of
price. However, eqn. (7) is not valid in logarithms, so that in equilibrium
the log of output is generally not a function of the log of imports.

10. Note that failure to reject the hypothesis that imports did not cause injury
is not the same as a rejection of the alternative hypothesis that imports did
cause injury. This latter hypothesis can almost never be rejected even if
imports did not in fact cause injury. The reason is that it is impossible to
disentagle a minimal amount of injury from no injury at all.

11. The test is performed by running two regressions, the first excluding current
and lagged values of x, and the second including them. Then one can utilize
the following statistic:
F =

N1(SSR1

—

SSR2)/N2(SSR2)

where SSR1 and SSR2 are the sums of squared residuals from the first and
second regressions respectively, N1 is the number observations less the
number of estimated parameters in the second rgression, and N2 is the
number of parameters in the second regression minus the number of parameters
in the first regression. This statistic is distributed as F(N1/N2). See
Sims, supra, and Sargent, supra, note 24.
12. In a 5 to 0 decision, the 1TC concluded that relief was indeed warranted.
However, the Commission's recommendation as to the form of that relief showed
much less unanimity; two commissioners voted for a quota on imports, two
voted for a 5 cent/pound tariff, and one voted for no protection. in
September 1984, President Reagan decided against protection.

13. Time series data on employment in other segments of the industry were
avalable only for 1972—83. However, for this period the correlation
coefficient between mining employment and smelting and refining employment is
.93.

14. Adequate data on the earnings of workers in other segments of the industry
were unavailable, but unpublished Department of Labor statistics from 1970
onwards indicate that the earnings of smelting and refining employees have
increased faster than the earnings for mining.
15. Imports of refined copper are used in the regression equation for refinery
production, while total U.S. imports for consumption of refined and blister
copper are used in the regressions for smelter production, mine production,
and mining employment.
16. In the regressions of the form of (10), imports had no statistically
significant negative effect on prices. On the other hand, the statistically
significant coefficients reported in Table 1 imply that Granger tests of lack
of causality from imports to the other indicia we have considered would have
been rejected.

17. This is the basis of Grossman's analysis of steel imports. (See note 5.)
Grossman, however, makes the extreme assumption that the import supply
schedule is infinitely elastic.
18. This information is particularly useful when there is a large number of
measurable variables affecting the supply of imports. Then the fact that
their injurious effects are all mediated through imports imposes constraints
on the coefficient 6' in (11).
