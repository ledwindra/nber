Effects

of

Inflation on the Pattern

of International Trade

ABSTRACT

This paper examines the relationship between inflation, exchange
rates, and the pattern of international trade and payments in a small

economy with utility—maximizing agents and a transactions demand for

money. Fully anticipated inflation has real effects in the model
through its role as a tax on money and thereby on monetary transactions.
An increase in the rate of monetary expansion generally reduces the
value of domestic output and alters the composition of domestic produc-

tion. The result is a change in the pattern of international comparative
advantage and trade flows. The initial depreciation of the exchange rate
following an increase in the rate of monetary expansion is accompanied by
a trade surplus and capital outflow, while the subsequent depreciation is
accompanied by a trade deficit.

I. Introduction
The relationships between exchange rates, monetary policies, and real
trade flows have received renewed attention recently as Dornbusch and
Fischer (1980), Lucas (1980b), Rodriguez (1980), Weiss (1980), and Stockman
(1980a, 1981a) have examined the effects of real shocks on the exchange rate,

relative prices, and trade flows. Dornbusch and Fischer, and Helpman and
Razin (1981) also examine the impact of

systematic anticipated monetary policy

on the exchange rate and real trade flows. Wilson (1979a) investigates similar
issues in the context of Dornbuschts (1976) model. The
this research with recent work by Lucas (1980a),

current paper integrates

Wilson (1979b), 'Jovanovic (1981),

and Stockman (1981b), and examines the influence of fully anticipated inflation
on the exchange rate, relative prices, and the pattern of international trade.
Fully anticipated inflation has real effects in the model through its influ-

ence on the cost of holding money, which is used to facilitate transactions.
These real effects have impacts on the exchange rate, relative prices, and
the pattern of the international division of labor and trade flows.
The conclusions reached here contrast with those reached by Obstfeld

(1980) in a related analysis. The essential difference between the analyses
is that Obstfeld places money directly into the utility function, whereas
money yields indirect utility in the analysis here, through its use in

facilitating transactions. This latter formulation has been utilized by Lucas,

-2-

Helpman (1981), Helpman and Razin, wilson (197gb), and Stockman (1980a, 1981b)

and a related formulation has been utilized by Jovanovic. The conclusions
reached here also differ from those of Helpman and Razin, as this paper
extends their analysis to incorporate elements of capital accumulation,
the labor-leisure choice, and the markets for factors of production.1

The analysis is conducted for the case of a small country that takes
its terms of trade as given by the outside world, although the last section
of

the paper discusses the implications of relaxing this assumption. The

setup of the

model is described in Section II.

Sections III and IV

inves-

tigate the effects of systematic, anticipated inflation on the relative
price of nontraded goods, the production and consumption of importables,

exportables, and nontraded goods, and the pattern of international trade.
Section V discusses international trade in assets and extensions of the
analysis to a full world equil ibrium model.

II. A Small-Country Model
Considera country in which there is a representative agent who consumes
exportables, importables, and a nontraded good. Since trade patterns in this
model will be determined endogenously, the two traded goods will be referred
to

simply as good one" and "good two." Good one can be consumed directly,

or turned into "capital ," which is an input into the production of all three
goods.
three

The representative agent chooses a sequence of consumptions of the

goods, C1, C2, CN leisure, 1-i, and the allocations of capital and labor

across industries, to maximize utility,

Capital depreciates at rate 6.

In addition to the budget constraint, the agent faces a payments technology
that requires that all purchases during a uperiodI be made with money holdings

acquired by the beginning of the period. This is formalized by a "cash-in—
advance" constraint that has been used in the papers cited above by Lucas, Wilson,

Helpman, Helpman and Razin, and Stockman. The constraint takes the form,3

This completes the description of the optimization problem for a
representative, price—taking, agent in the domestic economy.5

The next

section investigates the characteristics of the equilibrium for the case of
a small economy (taking as given the terms of trade and foreign nominal prices).

[II. Equilibrium of a Small Open Economy
The equilibrium conditions for the economy require that the money market
and the market for the nontraded good clear, i.e.

Md = MS

and h(KN,N) = c4.

(16)

Together, the equations (16) and the budget constraint (2) require a zero
balance of trade.6

The domestic nominal prices of traded goods, p1 and p2, are equal to the
exchange rate times the (fixed) foreign currency prices of goods one and two.
The domestic price of nontraded goods and the exchange rate, are, however,
determined endogenously by (16).

Denote the rate of monetary expansion (through transfer payments) p,
so

Mt =

(l-fp)Mti.

Then consider a steady state equilibrium. Since consumption is constant over
time in the steady state, (7) implies that there is a unique, constant steady
state value of p1(X-i-y). So (15) implies that there is a unique, constant

steady state value of Api, while (14) implies that c

(9) then implies that Xp1 takes a constant steady state value. So

(15) implies that, in the steady state,

is positive except when there is deflation at the discount rate

which is

the rule for the optimal quantity of money. A positive value for y, however,
implies that (5) holds as a strict equality for all t, so that the velocity

of money is fixed in the steady state (at

Combining (9), (14), and (18), we have

(19)

as an analog to the result in Stockman (1981b). Given employment of labor in
industry one, a higher rate of monetary expansion reduces capital and production

in that industry. Given fixed terms of trade,

results hold in industry two:

(20)

The change in proiuction in each of the traded goods industries, when i

changes, is independent of demand for those goods, given employment of labor
in the traded good industries. However, that is not true in the nontraded
goods industry. There, the equilibrium conditions impose domestic marketclearing, so the response of demand for the nontraded good is central, as
discussed below.7

-8Equations

(19) and (20) utilized the first equation in (9) in their

derivation, so that they hold whenever the total capital stock is endogenously

determined. It is useful, however, to first investigate the properties of
the model with a fixed capital stock. This will be discussed in two stages.
First, both the aggregate domestic capital stock and its allocation across

industries will be taken as fixed. The model then is similar to Jones' (1971)
specific-factor model. Second, the aggregate capital stock will be assumed
to be exogenously determined, but the allocation of capital services across

industries will be chosen endogenously. Finally, Section V will return to the
case of an endogenously determined aggregate capital stock.

Exogenous Capital in Each Industry

When capital in each industry is exogenously fixed, equations (9) and

(14) are not part of the model. As noted above, (7) and (15) imply that

(x+y)p1 and Ap are constant in the steady state. Now, sThce (8) implies a
constant steady state value of Xp1, (15) implies that

=

p1

which, in the steady state, implies (17). So, unless there is deflation at

(5')

and (18) continue to hold.

The effects of an increase in p can then be determined from the following,
which follow directly from (7), (8), (5'). and (17),8

discussed in Wilson (1979b), Stocknan (1980b), and Aschauer (1981). The

allocation of labor across traded good industries changes to maintain equality
of (the value of) the marginal products of labor in these industries.
The change in the pattern of international trade as p rises depends on

the relative magnitudes of f22 and g22, and on U11 and U22. Suppose, for
example,

that both the exportable and importable goods industries have Cobb-

Douglas production functions with the same constant-returns-to-scale technology
(same parameters), but that industry one, the exportable-goods industry, has
a greater (fixed) capital stock than the importable-goods industry. Then

in c1 and c2 are identical, so that both exports and imports fall.

An increase in p, in this case, reduces the total volume of international
trade.
Production of the nontraded good falls with an increase in ii, but the
effect of a higher p or the relative price of the nontraded good,

,

is

p1

ambiguous, reflecting both a decrease in supply and a decrease in demand.
The effect of a higher p on the exchange rate can be determined from (5k),
(16), (2), and the condition

-10-

where e is the exchange rate and p and p are the foreign currency prices
of the two traded goods. The exchange rate is consequently

An increase in i, by reducing f, g, and h? raises e except in the case where

— (which may rise or fall with a higher p) rises sufficiently to offset the
p1

falls in f, g, and h. This exceptional case would correspond to a kind of
immiserizing (negative) growth, where the reduction in the supply of the nontraded good raises its price sufficiently to increase the value of total output
in all industries.

These results have been obtained for the case of fixed capital stocks in

each industry. If the aggregate capital stock is fixed but capital is free
to move across industries, then the last two equations in (9) are relevant
for determining the equilibrium distribution of capital across industries.
If there were no nontraded good, then the change in the pattern of production
in the economy when ji

rises

would be given by the Rybczynski theorem, with the

pattern of trade affected also by wealth elasticities of demand. With nontraded
goods in the model, the resulting reallocation of production depends partly on
consumer preferences, through the effect of preferences on the relative price
of the nontraded good and consequently on the amounts of labor and capital

employed in the nontraded goods industry. The derivation of these results is
straightforward; the next section turns to the case in which investment,
and hence the aggregate capital stock, is endogenous.

Endogenous Determination of Investment and Capital

IV.

If the amount of investment, and hence the aggregate capital stock,
is viewed as endogenously determined, then (14), and consequently (19) and

(20), are again relevant to the model. Given total employment of labor in
each industry, (19) and (20) show a negative relationship between u and

production in each of the traded goods industries. Similarly, given the
employment of labor in each industry, (2), (7), and (16) imply

which is seen to be negative. However, unlike the effects of a higher rate
of monetary expansion on 1(1 and K2 (from (19) and (20)), (29) involves parameters

of demand as well as supply, and involves supply parameters from all three
industries.

Given these results, (28) can be used to obtain the change in the relative
price of nontraded goods when the rate of monetary expansion changes, assuming
that

£2) and

are fixed. This is seen to involve two opposing effects.

First, the increase in (A+y)p1 as p rises, which can be obtained from (26),
(27), and (28), represents a wealth effect reducing the demand for nontraded

goods. On the other hand, the shift in the capital stock involves a reduction
in supply. So although production of the nontraded good is reduced, the
relative price may either rise or fall as p rises.

The effect of an increase in p on the exchange rate is again obtained

from (25), this time using (19), (20), (29), and (28). Again, as in the
previous section, an increase in p raises e except in an Himmiserizing.growthhJ

type situation.
These results hold fixed the employment of labor in each industry.
Given these employments, capital in each industry falls when p rises, and

the pattern of international trade is changed. Similarly, it was shown in
the previous section that, given the employment of capital in each industry,

the employment of labor in each industry falls as p rises. In both cases

relative price of the nontraded good may either rise or fall, and unless

the

the relative price of the nontraded good rises substantially, the exchange
rate rises (domestic currency depreciates).
When

to

both total employment and the aggregate capital stock are free

adjust, and to move freely between industries, there are two additional

effects on the patterns of production and trade. First, since with a fixed

-13--

total capital stock (or employment of labor), an increase in p reduces
employment

(or

the capital stock), the marginal product of capital (or labor)

is reduced. This tends to reduce production in each industry. Second, the
negative wealth effect of an increase in p raises the supply of labor, which
tends to increase production.

The interindustry allocation of capital and labor is now affected by

consumer preferences as well as technology and prices. This is true even in
the absence of a nontraded good. In order to see this, ignore the noritraded

good. Using (21) — (24) (except the last equations in (21) and (22), which
refer to the nontraded goods industry), one obtains

The first term on the right-hand side of each equation in (36) is

negative, as expected from the earlier results when the employment of labor

in each industry (ant total employment) was fixed. Now, however, there is a
second effect in (36) on capital employed in each traded goods industry,

associated with the change in the pattern of production when i rises.

As a

result, it is possible that capital employed in one of the two industries
(though not both) rises when i

rises.

Suppose production in each traded goods industry is Cobb-Eouglas, and
that the exportable goods industry (industry one) is more capital intensive

than the importable goods industry. Then

it is straightforward to show that

aggregate production falls when p rises. In the example being considered,
production of exportables falls, while production of importables may either
rise or fall (with a rise more likely the greater the divergence in capital

intensities across industries). With a homothetic utility function, the
volume of trade falls (as long as good one remains an exported good). If
the capital intensities are sufficiently diverse, then an increase in p may
cause good one to become the imported good and good two the exported good,
that is, there may be a complete reversal in the pattern of trade.

V. Asset Trade arid World Equilibrium

The previous sections have examined the effect of an increase in the
rate of monetary expansion on international trade by comparing steady states
for an economy that faces a relative price of traded goods determined in the
outside world. This section discusses changes in portfolio and asset, positions
during the transition from one rate of monetary expansion to another, and the

impacts of an increase in p on the rest of the world and feedbacks on the
domestic economy.

The steady state is associated with a constant net credit (debt) position

for the domestic economy with respect to the rest of the world. Initially,
p1

retain the small country assumption that — is given by the rest of the world,
p2

and assume that there is a foreign asset, that may be held by domestic residents,
that earns a real rate of return of

Consider an increase in p. The

resulting decline in K in the steady state can be accomplished immediately

if capital can be exported. Since consumption behavior (see (7)) is of a
permanent—income type, the domes.tic country does not trade away capital in

return for consumption goods, but, rather, for foreign assets. The interest
on these assets then finances a steady stream of future consumption, with

the principal intact. Thus an increase in p leads to an immediate current
account surplus and capital account deficit. Recall that this is associated
with a depreciation of domestic currency. Following this immediate current
account surplus is a trade deficit (associated with an equal service account
surplus) in the new steady state, and a continuing depreciation of domestic

currency. So, while the initial increase in the exchange rate following an
increase in p is associated with a trade surplus and capital outflow, the
subsequent rise in the exchange rate over time is associated with a trade
deficit.

The changing relationship between the balance of trade and exchange
rate movements is similar to a conclusion reached by Dornbusch and Fischer

as a response to an anticipated one-time change in the money supply. In
their model the initial surplus and subsequent deficit are part of the

transition back to the initial real equilibrium. Here, the initial surplus
and subsequent trade deficit occur in response to an increase in the rate
of monetary expansion, and are associated with the economy's movement to
a new real equilibrium.

Although the model presented in this paper considers a single (small,
open) economy, the results can shed some light on the new world equilibrium.
In the Cobb-Douglas case considered in Section IV, the decline in exports

of good one and imports of good two due to an increase in the rate of
p1

monetary expansion would tend to raise — on world markets. This would
p2

induce the rest of the world to shift resources away from industry two

and into industry one. As a result, world factor prices'would change.
If industry one is relatively apita1 intensive in the rest of the world,
as it is in the domestic country, the Stolper-Samuelson theorem implies
an increase in the real return to capital and a decrease in the real

return to labor. This would induce additional investment and capital
accumulation in the rest of the world until the foreign analogs of (19)

and (20) are satisfied. Consequently, in the new steady state equilibrium,
the reduction in the domestic capital stock would be partly offset by an
increase in the foreign capital stock.
p1

The extent to which a change in —, determined on world markets, feeds
p2

back on the domestic economy obviously depends on the size of the country,
the magnitude of the initial shift in trade patterns following a change in
p, and the elasticity of substitution in production along the transformation

-18-

curve in the rest of the world. It also depends upon the behavior of labor
supply in the rest of the world, since, through the foreign analogs of (19)
and (20), the behavior of labor supply affects the magnitude of capital

accumulation in the rest of the world. Foreign capital accumulation thus
provides an additional margin of substitution when a single country

experiences an increase in inflation. This additional margin of sub—
stitution would be absent, however, if the increase in inflation were worldwide.

VI.

Concluding Remarks

Recent models of exchange rates and real trade flows have focused
on the effects of real disturbances in relative prices, exchange rates,

and asset accumulation. The effects of monetary changes in these models
have typically emphasized real-balance effects or Mundell-Tobin non—

neutralities. This paper has examined the effect on exchange rates and
the pattern of international trade of an increase in the rate of monetary

expansion. The framework for the introduction of money was borrowed from
recent research on monetary economies with transactions technologies that

motivate a demand for fiat money. Although the paper has focused on the
effects of monetary expansion, the framework of the analysis maintains the
features that have been emphasized in the recent work on the effects of real
disturbances.

An increase in the rate of monetary expansion has real effects in the
model presented here because it raises the cost of transacting, since, with

a transactions demand for money, money is more costly to hold. Given an
exogenous stock of capital and its allocation across industries, an increase
in the rate of monetary expansion reduces the employment of labor in the
exportables, importables, and nontraded goods industries, and alters the

—l 9-

nation's comparative advantage. When capital can freely move between
industries, the total employment of labor falls but some industries may

expand production. With capital accumulation or decumulation permitted,
an increase in the rate of monetary expansion reduces the aggregate
capital stock as well, further affecting the nation's comparative

advantage. The movement of capital between industries can result in an
increase in production in some, but not all, industries. If capital
intensities across industries are sufficiently diverse, the pattern of
trade may undergo a complete reversal, with previously imported (exported)

goods becoming exports (imports). If financial assets are traded, then an
increase in the rate of monetary expansion results in a depreciation of
domestic currency associated initially with a trade surplus and subsequently
with a trade deficit.

The paper has not analyzed a full world equilibrium along the lines

of the paper by Helpman and Rain, and it would be important to do so for •

an empirical application, since the effects of a change in foreign inflation
on a country's pattern of trade would have to be distinguished from the

effects of a change in its own inflation rate. Furthermore, the transactions
technology postulated to motivate a demand for money is quite crude. Alternative transactions technologies might consider the role of other assets and

perhaps a system of financial intermediation. If the financial industry uses
capital and labor inputs and if the volume of financial services expands
with inflation, then there will be additional factors affecting comparative
advantage and the pattern of trade.

'Helpman and Razin, however, examine a full 2 country world equilibrium

model, while the current paper is mainly restricted to a small open economy.
2The representative agent is a demander and supplier of all three goods.

While any individual may actually supply labor to only one industry, financial
markets within the economy permit each agent to act as if he were a hypothetical
representative agent supplying all three goods.

31n the papers by Lucas (1980b), Helpman (1981), Helpman and Razin (1981),
and Stockman (1980a), there are two equations of the form (5), one for domestic
money and domestic purchases, and the other for foreign money held by domestic

residents associated with their purchases of foreign goods. Here it is assumed
that domestic importers are able to exchange domestic money for foreign money
just prior to their purchase of foreign goods, so there need not be a trans-

actions demand for foreign money. Alternatively, the analysis in the paper
may be interpreted as assuming that the domestic currency is used in all
international trade transactions.

4An interior solution is assumed, so non-negativity constraints are not
explicitly considered.
5A1 though the current analysis does not explicitly include trade in

financial assets, their introduction into the analysis is straightforward,

following, for example, Helpman (1981). Section V discusses the transition
between alternative steady states in the presence of tradeable financial
assets.
6More generally, the equations imply a zero balance of payments. See
footnote 5.

See equation (29).
