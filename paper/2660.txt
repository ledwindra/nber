THE PENSION INDUCEMENT TO RETIRE:
AN OPTION VALUE ANALYSIS

ABSTRACT
The option value model developed in an earlier paper is used to simulate
the effect on retirement of changes in a firm's pension plan compared to the
effect of changes in Social Security provisions.

The provisions of the firm's

on
pension plan have a much greater effect than Social Security regulations
the retirement decisions of the firm's employees.

The analysis supports the

following conclusions:

•

to 60, for example,
Increasing the firm's early retirement age from 55
would reduce by almost 40 percent, from .48 to .30, the fraction of
employees that is retired by age 60.

•

The effect of changes in Social Security rules, on the other hand,
would be small.

Raising the Social Security retirement ages by one

year, for example, has very little effect on employee retirement rates.
The proportion retired by age 62 is reduced by only about 4 percent.
•

Changes in Social Security provisions that would otherwise encourage
workers to continue workfng can easily be offset by countervailing
changes in the provisions of the firm's pension plan.

Firm responses,

like delaying the Social Security offset to correspond to m later
Social Security retirement age, may simply be m logical revision of
current firm plan provisions.

firm employment. Bulow [1981] described pension wealth accrual under rhese
plans and Lazear [1983] emphasized the porential role of plan provisions in
inducing early rerirement, as a suhsriture for mandatory rerirement. The very
substanrial incentive effects of these plans have been emphasized most
recently by Kotlikoff and Wise [1985, 1987, 1988], who summarize the
incentives of approximately 2500 plans covered by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics Level of Benefits Survey,

and consider in great detail the effects

of the provisions of a large Fortune 500 firm.

This work demonstrates that

the typical firm plan provides a large reward for remaining with the firm
until some age, often the early retirement age, and then a substantial
inducement to leave the firm, often as early as 55.

Almost all plans

incorporate a large penalty for working past age 65.

The gain in wage

earnings from working an additional year is often offset in large part by a
loss in the present value of future pension benefits.
There has been very little analysis of the actual effects of these
incentives on retirement, however.

Exceptions are Burkhauser [1979], Fields

and Mitchell [1982], Lazear [1983], Kotlikoff and Wise [1987], and Hogarth
[1988].

One reason for the limited attention has been the absence of

appropriate data.

The analysis in this paper is based on the personnel

records of a large Fortune 500 firm.

The firm pension plan was described in

detail by Kotlikoff and Wise [1987], who also related the plan provisions to
departure rates from the firm.
The goal of this paper is to quantify the effects of pension plan
provisions on departure rates from the firm and, in particular, to demonstrate
the effect of potential changes in plan provisions. A particularly important
component of the analysis is to demonstrate the relative effects of changes in

The accrual of Social Security benefits may also be calculated in a

similar manner, and is also comparable to wage earnings.

Figure 1 shows the

present value at age 50 of expected future compensation in all three forms.
The line labelled earnings represents cumulated earnings, by age of
retirement.3

For example, if the person were to retire at age 62, his

cumulated earnings between age SO and age 62, discounted to age 50 dollars
would be about $300,000.

The slope of the earnings line represents annual

earnings discounted to age 50 dollars. Earnings decline rather slowly through
age 60 and much more rapidly thereafter.
The solid line shows the accrual of firm pension plus Social Security
benefits, again discounted to age 50 dollars.

The shape of this profile is

determined primarily by the pension plan provisions. The most important

An employee could leave

If he were to do that, and if he were vested in the firm's

pension plan- - which occurs after 10 years of service- -he would he entitled to
normal retirement pension benefits at age 65, based on his years of service
and current dollar earnings at age 53.

He could start to receive benefits as

early as age 55, the penaion early retirement age, but the benefit amount
would be reduced actuarially.

If he started to receive benefits at age 55,

they would be only 36 percent of dollar amount he would receive at age 65.
If, however,

he were to remain in the firm until the early retirement age, the

situation would be quite different.

He would be entitled to normal retirement

benefits based on his years of service and salary at age 55.

considering whether to retire now, at age 50.

If he does he will receive

dies.

(In fact, he will not be able to receive firm pension benefits until

age 55 and Social Security benefits can not be taken until sge 62.)

It is clear that the early retirement provisions in this firm are likely
to have an important effect on retirement decisions.

The qualitative effect

of changing the early retirement age can be seen by comparing figures 1 and

Estimates of the actual effects of such a change are presented below.

It was

that changing the firm early

retirement age from 55 to 60 would have a substantial effect on retirement.
The potential effect of changes in Social Security provisions can be seen by
altering the options faced by the person described in figure 5.

The current

Social Security rules reduce benefits by 5/9 of a percent for each month that
benefits are taken before age 65.

Suppose that the reduction were 1 percent

per month instead of 5/9.

The effect on the options faced by the figure 5

person are shown in figure

6.

The effect is noticeable, but not extreme.

The

value of retirement benefits before age 65 has been shifted downward, and thus
total income associated with retirement before age 65 has been shifted down.
The result would apparently be a lower likelihood of retirement between 62 and
65, judging

by the change in the graph. Actual estimates of the effect of

such a change in Social Security provisions are presented below.

that

in a regression equation explaining retirement. Indeed, it was their work,

Comparison of the aecond and third values shows that retirement probabilities
based on the model fit the data much better than predictions that would be
obtained by using a dummy variable for each age.

One might assume that using

the sample average retirement rate for each age would provide very good
predictiona.

But what the comparison reflects ia that retirement

probabilities vary a great deal among peraons of the same age.

That this was

Another way to understand the model fit is to compare actual versus

Beyond age 64 the sample sizes

are too small to make reliable comparisons. The proportion of those in the
firm at age SO that would remain at age 54, based on actual retirement rates,
is .14; the predicted proportion is .12.

This suggests that even though

measured variables may often not evaluate correctly the alternative to
continued work in the firm for younger employees, the error specification
allows enough flexibility that the model predictions are still quite accurate.

At older ages, the model predicts almost precisely the proportion of employees
who have left the firm,

as shown in figure 7.

example, increasing the Social Security retirement ages reduced the retirement

Summary and Concluding Comments
The option value model developed in Stock and Wise [1988] has been used

to simulate the effects on retirement of changes in a firm's pension plan and
of changes in Social Security rules.

Several important conclusions are

supported by the analysis:

•

•

The provisions of the firm's pension plan have a much greater
effect than Social Security regulations on the retirement
decisions of the firm's employees.
55 to 60, for
Increasing the firm's early retirement age from
example, would reduce by almost 40 percent, from .48 to .30, the
fraction of employees that is retired by age 60.

The effect of changes in Social Security rules, on the other hand,
would be small. Raising the Social Security retirement ages by
one year, for example, has very little effect on employee
retirement rates. The proportion retired by age 62 is reduced by
only about 4 percent.

•

Changes in Social Security provisiona that would otherwise
encourage workers to continue working can easily be offset by
countervailing changes in the provisions of the firm's pension
plan. Firm responses, like delaying the Social Security offset to
correspond to a later Social Security retirement age, may siaply
be a logical revision of current firm plan provisioos.

Thus in considering the effect of changes in Social Security rules,

like the

retirement age, it is important to understsnd the implications of private
pension plan provisions.

In particular, if rhe effect on retirement decisions

of changes in Social Security rules is to be predicted the potential response
of firms to the changes cannot be

ignored.

Although the analysis is based on the retirement experience in a single
large firm, the firm's pension plan is typical of defined benefit plans.
Approximately 75 percent of the employees who are covered by a firm pension
have defined benefit plans.

Thus the results suggest that pension plans in

general have had a very substantial effect on the labor force participation
rates of older workers.
In addition to the simulations, the paper describes the option value
model of retirement.

Comparisons of actual versus predicted retirement rates

demonstrate that the model predicts very complicated retirement patterns with
considerable precision.

That the model fits observed data well increases our

confidence in the simulated results.
