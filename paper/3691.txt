IMMIGRATION POLICY. NATIONAL ORIGIN, AND IMMIGRANT SKILLS:
A COMPARISON OF CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES

ABSTRACT
Over 12 million persons migrated to Canada or the United

States between 1959 and 1981. Beginning in the mid—1960s, the
immigration policies of the two countries began to diverge
considerably: the United States stressing family reunification

and Canada stressing skills. This paper shows that the point
system used by Canada generated, on average, a more skilled

immigrant flow than that which entered the United States. This
skill gap, however, is mostly attributable to differences in the
national origin mix of the immigrant flows admitted by the two

countries. In effect, the point system aworksh because it alters
the national origin mix of immigrant flows, and not because it
generates a more skilled immigrant flow from a given source
country.

IMMIGRATION POLICY, NATIONAL ORIGIN, AND iMMIGRANT SKILLS:
A COMPARISON OF CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES

George 3. Borjas

*

L Introduction
Roth Canada and the United States are important participants in the
ieusigration market. These two countries admitted over 12 million immigrants

between 1959 and 1981. In recent years. their immigration policies have
diverged considerably. Prior to the early i96Os, both Canada and the United
States used national origin to allocate the scarce nueiher of visas aoong the
many applicants, preferring persons originating in northwestern European

countries.1 During the l96Os, the two countries enacted major immigration
policy changes. As a result, the United States began to award entry permits
on the basis of the applicant's family ties with U.S. residents or citizens,
while Canada began to allocate visas on the basis of the applicant's
observable socioeconomic characteristics.
The historical comparison of isusigrant skills and labor market

performance between Canada and the United States, therefore, can provide
useful lessons into the benefits and costs of skill-based immigration

policies. Earlier work has documented important differences hetwecn the
Canadian and American experiences.2 This paper conrinues this line of
research and documents that many of the differences in the economic impact
of foreign-born workers on Canada and the United States can be understood in

terms of a simple hypothesis: the national origin composition of immigrants
in the two host countries is different.
The source country distribution of immigrant flows plays a crucial role
because there is substantial dispersion in skills and labor market

2

performance among national origin groupa (Borjas, 1987; Jasso and

Rosenzweig. 1986). In general, immigrants originating in industrialized
economies are more skilled and ate more successful in the host country's
labor market than isanigtants originating in the less-developed countries.

The empirical analysis below shows that the observed differences between
Canada and the United States in the average skill level of foreign-born

workers can be mostly explained by differences in the national origin cix
of the immigrant flows admitted into the 140

countries.

This finding raises important questions about the efficacy of Canada's

point system. My empirical analysis indicates that the point syotea "works'
not because ii attracts more skilled workers from a particular source
country, but because it alters the national origin mix of the immigrant

flow.3 This implication cf the empirical evidence provides a very different
understanding of how a point system increases rho average skills of foreignborn workers.

II. Immiaration Policies Between 1980 and 1980
Prior tn the 1965 Amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act,
U.S. irsmeigration policy was guided by the national-origins quota system.4

Entry visas allocated to countries in the Eastern Mersisphere depended

proportionately on their representation in the national origin composition

of the U.S. population in 1920. Because the ancestors of the great majority
of U.S. residents originated itt northwestern Europe, the United Kingdom wcs

allocated 65,721 visas (almost half of the 150,000 available visas) and
Germany was allocated 25,957 visas, while Italy was allocated 5,902 and
Russia was allocated 2,784 visas. To prohibit the entry of Asian

immigrants, Asian countries were generally allocated 100 visas per year.

The national-origins quota system applied only to visa applicants
originating

in countries in the Eastern Hemisphere. Applicants [coin North

and South America were exempt itom the quotas and faced no numerical

resLrictions on the number of visas, presuemably because of the close

economic end political ties between the United Srates and its geographic

neighbors. These visas were awarded on m first-come, first-served basis as

long as the applicants satisfied a long list of requirements regarding their
health and their political and moral backgrounds.
The 1965 Amendments (and subsequent revisions) regulated
legal

the process of

immigration throughout the 1970s and l9SOs. Under the 1965

Amendments, the United States permzmitted the entry of

year, with no more than 20,000

270,000 persons per

iaammigrants originating in any particular

country of origin. Instead of enphasizing national origin, the 1965
Amendments made family reunification the central objective of imasigration

policy. This was accoaplished through several provisions. First,

go

percont of the 270,000 numerically limited visas were awardnd to "close"
relatives

of U.S.

unmarried

adult children

or residents. These close relatives included
of U.S. citizens, siblings of adult U.S. citizens,

citizens

spouses of resident aliens. The renaming 20 percent of the visas were
allocated to persons on the basis of their skills. A large number of these

and

Sim,000

visas, ho,.mever. went to the fanilies ef the skilled workers who

qualified

for the visa.

Furthermore, parents. spouses, and minor children of adult U.S. citizens
could bypass the numerical restrictions specified in the legislation, These
"immediate" relatives automatically qualified for entry, and did not have to

apply for one of the 2)0,000 numerically United visas. By the late 1981k,
aore immigrants were entering under this single provision of the law than
under all the family reunification preferences combined.
Until l9il, Canadian immigration policy, like that of the United States,
permitted the entry of persons originating in only a few selected countties,
such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, and tha United States, or of persons

who were dependents of Canadian residents. Major policy changes in 1962 and
1967 removed the national origin restrictions, and shtfted the emphasis in

the visa allocation system towards skills requirements. Under the new
regulations, applicants for entry into Canada were classified into three

categories: sponsored immigrants (which included close relatives of
Canadian residents), nominated relatives (which included more distant
relatives of Canadian residents), and independent immigrants.
Beginning in 1967, visa applicants in the last two of these categories

were screened by means of a point syateo

Potential migrants were graded

and given op to 100 points. Points were awarded according to the
applicant's education (a point per year of schooling, up to 20 points).

occupational demand (up to 15 points if the applicant's occupation was in
strong demand in Canada), age (up to 10 points for applicants under the age
of 35, minus 1 point for each year over the age 35), arranged employment (10
points if the applicant had a job offer from a Canadian eaployet), a
"personal assessment" by the immigration officer based on the applicant's
motivation and initiative (up to 15 points), and other factors. 5

Generally,

en applicant needed to obtain 50 out of the 100 total points in order to
pass the test and be awarded an entry visa.

In 1976, Canada amended its Immigration Act and made it easier for the

I

5

families of Canadian residents to migrate there. This was

accomplished

through a revised point system that, in essence, awarded extra points to

nominated relatives. To socc extent, Canada enacted a weak version of the
1965 Aisendxsents eleven years after the United States.

Certainly the most noticeahle consequence of the major policy shifts in
Canada and the United States is the change that occurred in the notional

origin mix of the immigrant flow. Table 1 summarizes the national origin
distribution of the iamigrant flows admitted between 1959 sod 1981. Curing
the 1960a, about 40 percent of immigrants entering the United States

originated in Europe. This had declined to 17 percent by the 1970s. In
contrast, only 12.8 percent of immigrants in the 1960s originated in Asian
countries, and this tripled to 37.2 percent by the 197Oa.

Similar changes were also observed in Canada. For instance. 70 percent
of immigranta entering Canada in the l960a originated in the United Kingdom

or in other European countries. During the l9lOs, the fraction of the
immigrant flow originating in Europe was cut by half, to 37 percent. On the
other hand, the fraction of icesigrants originating in Asia almost

quadrupled, from 8 percent in the l9iOs to 29 percent in the 19?Oa.
Although the trend sway from European immigration and towards Asian
immigration characterixes the experience of both Canada and the Unites
States, it is important to note that there were significant differences in
the national origin mix of the immigrant flow between the two host countries

in the l9JOs. The fraction of immigrants originating in Europe was more
than twice as large in Canada, while the fraction of immigrants originating
in the Americas (primarily Lotin America) was slaost three times as large in

the United States. I will show that these national origin differentials

III. Education and the 'Choice of a Host Country
As a result of changes in immigration policy (as well as changes in
economic conditions in the host and source countries), the relative size and
skill composition of immigrant flows into Canada and the Unired States

changed drastically in recent years. This section and the next describe the
extent of these changes.
Consider the population of persons who imisigrste at any given time

period into either Canada or the United States. These data can be used to
calculate

the fraction of

immigrants who choose' one country over the

other. Table 2 reports the fraction of immigrants, by cohort and
educational attainment, who migrated to the United States.

I estimate the fraction of immigrants who choose the United States using
the Public Use Samples of the 1971 and 1981 Canadian Censuses and the 1970

and 1980 U.S. Censuses. The 1971 data are drawn from a 1/100 randcm sample
of the Canadian population, while the 1981 data are drawn from a 2/100
sample. The 1970 U.S. Census data for iimeigrants is a 2/100 random s-ample

of the immigrant population, while the 1980 data is a 5/100 sample. The
1970/1971 Censuses are used to estimate the choice probabilities for the

cohorts that migrated during the 1960s, and the 1980/1981 Censuses are used
for estimating the choice probabilities of the cohorts that migrated in the

l970s.6 Finally, the probabilities are calculated in the sample of
immigrants (both men and women) aged 18-64.
Between 1960 and 1980, 81.5 percent of the immigrants "chose" to reside

Source: The data for the l96064 and 1965-70 cohorts are drawn from the
1971 Canadian Census and the 1970 U.S. Census. The data for the 1970-74 and
1975-80 cohorts ate drawn from the 1981 Canadian Census and the 1980 U.S.
Census. The statistics are calculated in the sample of immigrants aged 18-

64.

in the United States. Note, however, that this statistic increased rapidly
during the period. In the early 1960s, 77.2 percent of the sample migrated
to the United States, while in the late 1970s 86,1 percent chose the United
States,

This reallocation of isssigrants in the North American continent is

due to the fact that policy changes in the United
annual number of iisisigrants, while the size

Canada

States increased the

of the annual iineigrant flow in

remained relatively constant (see Table 1).

A more interesting result revealed by Table 2 concerns the differential
trends in the choice probability across schooling groops. Although the
fraction of immigrants ending up in the United States increased in moat

schooling groups, the increase was largest among the least-educated. In the
eatly l960s, 72.1 percent of immigrants who did not have a high-school

diploma migrated to the United States. By the late 1970s, this statistic
was 86.9 percent. an increase of almoat 15 percentage points. In contrast,
in the early 1960s, 82.4 percent of isssigrants with a college diploma chose
the United States, hut by the early l97Ds, the fraction increased to only
89.0 percent, loss than 7 percentage points.

Immigration policy reforms in Canada and the United States are probably

responsible for these trends. Prior to the ensctmcnr of the point system in
Canada, relatively more college graduates "chose" the United States as a

destination point. By the late 197Dm, after Canada began to restrict the
entry of high school dropouts, the fraction of persons choosing the United
States was the same for high school dropouts as for college graduates.

IV. Immirrant Earnines in Canada and the United $tates
Suppose two Census cross-sections are available in a particular host

8

country (the 1971 and 1981 Censuses in Canada, or the 1970 and 198C Censuses
in the United States), and the iollowing regression model is estimated
within a host country:

(1)

lowj —Xfl1+a1y +o2y +tC+ ix +

(2)

log w2 —

+ 7w2

+

C2

where Wjj is the wage rate of immigrant j; w is the wage rate of native
person 2; X is a vector of socioeconomic characteristics (e.g., education,

age, etc.); y is a variable measuring the number of years that rho immigrant
has resided in the host country; C is a vector of dummy vatiahles indicating
the calendar year in which the migration occurred; and w ia a dummy variable
set to unity if the observation is drawn froa ihe 1980/1981 Census, and zero

otherwise. The vector of parameters (0102) along with the age
coefficients in the vector X, measures the assimilation effect (i.e. ,

the

rate at which the age/earnings profile of itsaigranis is converging to the
age/earnings profiles of natives), while the vector of parameters fi

estimates the cohort effects. The period effects arc given by -y for
immigrants and by 1n for natives.
It ie well known that the parameters of the system in (1) and (2) are
not identified unless some normalization is made about either the aging,
cohort, ot period effects (Serjes, 1991).

In other words, two cross-

sections cannot identify three separate sets of coefficients, and something
must be assumed about one of the effects in order to identify the other two.

:1

I choose the normalization that the period effect experienced by immigrants
is identical to the period effect experienced by natives (-y)

- This

normalization, of course, implies that the relative wage diiierential
between immigrants and natives is invariant to the business cycle.

The data used to estimate (1) and (2) are drawn from the Canadian and

U.S. Censuses described in the previous section. The regression analysis is
restricted to prima-age men (aged 25-64), who are not self-employed, whose

records report the relevant information needed to calculate a wage rate in
the year prior to the census, and who are not residing in group quartets.

Although all immigrant observations are used in the analysis, I use random
samples of the native population in the United States because of the large
number of natives surveyed.7
The mean characteristics in these samples are reported in Table 3 for

the post-1960 cohorts. The descriptive data yield a number of important
results. The U.S. Census clearly documents the importance of cohort effects
in immigrant labor market performance. The most recent arrivals in the 1970
Census (i.e., the 1965-1969 cohort) have -

.3

years fewer education than

natives, and earn about 16 percent less than natives. By 1980, the moat
recent arrivals (i.e., the 1975-1979 cohort) have -

.8 years fewer years of

schooling and earn almost 30 percent less than natives.

Remarkably, despite the enactment of the poiot system, the Canadian data

shows a somewhat similar pattern. The educational attainment of the most
recent immigrants in 1971 is 12.0 years, while that of the most recent
immigrants in 1981 is 12.6 years, an increase of over half a year in

schooling. At the same time, however, the educational attainment of recent
immigrants teistive to Canadian natives declined from a 2.1 year advantage

in 1971 to a 1.3 year advantage in 1981, and the relative wage of recent
immigrants decreased from -2.1 percent in 1971 to -17.2 percent in 1981.

Although the educational attainment of successive immigrant waves rose over
time, the educational attainment of the native Canadian population was
rising even faster.

This result, however, should not obscure the fact that the point system

attrmcted a mote educated immigrant flow Into Canada, In the early 1960s,
prior to the immigration reform in Canada, the typical immigrant entering
Canada had .4 fewer yeara of schooling than the typical immigrant entering
the United States (where the educational attainment is measured as oi

1970/1971), The Canadian disadvantage in immigrant schoolicg disappeared by
the late l960s, when the typical new immigrant in Canada had almost one year
more schooling than the typical new immigrant in the United States, and this
gap remained roughly constant throughout the l9lOs.
The dependent variable in (1) and (2) is the logarithm of the wage rate.

I use two different specifications for the vector X. The first includes an
intetcept, age, end age squared, while the second adds education, maritat
status, whether the individual lives in a metropolitan area, and whether the
individual's health limits work (available only for the United States).

The estimated regressions are presented in Appendix Table A-i for Canada and
A-2 for the United States. Table 4 suaniarites the impllrations of the
regressions by reporting the wage differential between immigrants and

natives at the time nf entry into the host country (assuming immigration
takes place at age 20), and the rate of growth of ieatigrant earnings
relative to natives at y—lO and y'-20.8

The results indicate that immigtants in Canada have substantially higher

entry wages (relative to natives) than immigrants in the United States if
the regressions do not control for differences in educational attainment and

other socioeconomic characteristics. For instance, the typical person who
migrated to Canada in the late l970a earns ahout 15 percent less thou
natives at the tioe of arrival, while rhe typical person who migrated to the
Unired States at the same time earns about 29 percent less than natives.

The superior economic performance of immigrants in Canada, however, largely
disappears after controlling for differences in observed demographic
characteristics

(particularly education) between irosigrants and natives in

each host country. The predicted difference between the (log) wage of
immigrants who arrived in the late

l9]Os and demographically cnmparahle

natives is .l in Canada and - .23 in the United States. lhe skill
filtering explicit in Canadian immigration policy, therefore, leads to
higher-woge imsrigrants not because oi unobserved factors such as ability and
training, hut because they ore oore educated.

The data in Table 4 indicate that the enactment of a point system in
Canada could not prevent a decline in the relative skill Jevel of immigrants
across successive waves. In both countries, the entry wage of isimigrarits is

higher for the earlier cohorts than for the later cohorts. Tho decline in
isasigrant skills (as measured by the unadjusted wage), however, is much

steeper in the United States, where the (relative) entry wage fell from -.10
in the early lS6Os to -

.29 in the late 1920s. gy contrast, in Canada, the

entry wage fell from - .03 to -

.15 during the same period.

V. liatlonal Origin and the Canada-U.S. Skill Differential

This section shows that one single factor, the different national origin

12

mix of immigrants in Canada and the United States, explains most of the
differences in skills and relative wages of the foreign-horn between these
ii

two countries. In Section IT, I docwsented that the national origin mix of
the immigrant flow differs between Canada and the United States. There also
exists substantial dispersion in

skills

and wages across national origin

groups in each of the host countries.
I focus on three neasures of skills: years of educational attairaaent,
the log wage rate (relative to natives) .

and the log wage differential

between isasigrants and natives adjusted for diffetences in socioeconomic

characteristics (such as education and age) between the two groups. To
calculate the adjusted wage. I first estimated log vage regressions
separately fat each national otigin gtonp and for natives in each of the

four Censuses available (two Censuses per host country). Using the
estimated coefficients, I caltulated the wage differential between each

the United States, the average education level of immigrants who arrived in
the same period ranged from 8.6 years far immigrants from Larin America to

16.2 years far workers who migrated from Belgium. The relative wage of
immigrants exhibits similar dispersion across national origin groups. The
relative (log) wage ranges from -

.4

(Creek immigrants) to .66 (Belgian

immigrants) in Canada, and from - .53 (immigrants from Latin America) to .46
(Belgian immigrants) in the United States.
As suggested hy these descriptive data, there is a very strong
correlation between the skills of national origin groups in Canada and the

skills of the corresponding group in the United States. Table 6 presents
regressions which describe the relationship between the skills of national

origin groups across host countries. These regressions are of the form:

y.(t) — p0 + p1y. (t) +

(3)

where

y.

is the value of the skill variable for immigrants belonging to

oarionat origin group i who migrated to the United States at tirec t; Yt0(t)
ia the value of the skill variable for the aarrre insaigraor cohort in Canada.10

The regressioos reported in Table 6 provide one very interesting insight.

For the post-1965 cohorts, with only one exception, the slope coefficient p1
is insignificantly different from unity, and the intercept is

insignificantly different from zero. Moreover, the explanatory power of

these regressions is quite high: the F2 is on the order of .5 to .8. Those
results imply that the expected skills or wages of a specific national
origin group in Canada and the United States (in the 1965-1980 period) sre

identical.

system generated a core skilled flow into Canada from within a source
country.

The finding that, on average, irrciigranta in Canada are more skilled than

immigrants in the United States is attributable to another factor. I now
show that the different national origin composition of immigrant flows in

the two countries accounts for much of the Canadian advantage. Let Y(t) be
the average value for a particular characteristic (i.e., education or wage)

observed in the immigrant flow in year t in host country r. By definition,

Y(t) can be wtiiten as:

(Li)

Yr(t)

—

p.(t) Yjr(t)

where y.(t) is the overage value for the labor market characteristic
observed among persons who migrated from source country j into host country

r in year t; and Pi(t) is the fraction of the host country's immigrant flow
in year c originating in source country j.

—

It is useful to define the overage labor narket performance that would
have been ohserved if a different national origin mix had migrated to host
country r, such es the national origin nix observed in host country s,

p.(t). This is given by:

(5)

Y(t,s) —

The decomposition implicit in equation (6) is similar to that commonly
used to measure wage discrimination (Oaxaca, 1973), and has its roots in the

statistical literature (Kitigawa, 1955). Using this methodological
framework, Table 7 decomposes the differences observed in educational
attainment and relative wages between Canada and the United States for each
of the immigrant waves arriving between 1960 and 1960.
To understand the nature of the results, it is instructive to first
coosidet the cohort that migrated to Canada or the United States in the late

l970s. The average education level of those who migrated to Canada was 12.6
years. while the average education level of those who migrated to the United
States was 11.9 years, a difference of .7 years. Column (3) of Table 7
reports the prediction of what the education level of immigrants in Canada
wouid have been had Canada sdmitted irmsigrants on the basis of the U.S.

national origin mix. In other words, it presents the- prediction from
equation (5) using the 1975-1980 means of educational attainment in Canada

and the 1975-1980 national origin mix observed in the United States. This
prediction is 12.3 yeats, so that the average educational attainment of this
immigrant wave would have been .3 years lover. National origin differences,
therefore, explain almost a half of the observed gap between the educational
attainment of the 1975-1980 immigrant wave in Canada and the United Ststea.
It is also pcssihle to estimate what the average educational attainment

of immigrants in the United States would have been had the U.S. accepted
immigrants on the basis of Canada's national origin mix. In other words,
equation (5) is estimated using the 1975-1980 means of educational

attainment in the United States and the national origin mix observed in

Canada in 1975-1980. This prediction1 reported in column (4) of Table 7, is
13.1 years. In other words, the educational attainment of U.S. immigrants
would have increased from 11.9 tn 13.1 years due solely to changes in the

national origin nix. This increase is greater than the observed difference
between Canada and the United States, so that national origin "overexplains"
the obsarved difference.

The reaaining rows of Table 7 report a similar decomposition for both
wagea and adjusted wages for the 1975-1980 cohort, as well as for all other

post-1960 cohorts. It is evident that differences in the national origin
mix between the Iwo hosr countries ate largely responsible ior the post-1965

differences in educational attainment, wages, and adjusted wages. For
instance, the diffetonco in relative wages between the immigrant wave that
arrived in Canada and the United States in 1965-1970 is .139, of which at

least one-half is attributahle to differences in national otigin. The
observed difference for the waves that arrived during the l97Us is around
.12, and over two-thirds of this gap is attrihutable to national origin.11

In contrast to the post-1965 enhorta rhe resulis in Table 7 show that
national origin played a different tole among persona who migrated in the

early 1960s, These data do not indicate that immigrants in Canada were
unambiguously mote skilled than immigrants in the Unired States. Motoover,
the differences in the national origin mix of this immigrant flow sometimes

worked to rhe advantage of the United States: The mean educational
attainment of immigrants in Canada would have increased from 10.5 to 11.2

years if Canada had had the national origin mix of the United States. The
decomposition of tLie wage differential between the two host countries,

17

however, does not yield an unambiguous indication that either country had a

more "desirable national origin mix.
The central implication of these results is clear. Differences in the
national origin mix of iomigrants arriving in Canada and the United States
since 1965 are mainly responsible for the higher average skills and relative

wages of immigrants in Canada. In view of this finding, it is worth
reassessing the role that immigration policy, and in particular a point

sysrem, can play in generating a more skilled immigrant flow. To the extent
that the point system is intended as a way of increasing the skill level of
immigrants from a given source country, the results in t'ahles 6 and 7 are

discouraging. A point system seems to have little effect on the education
level or relative wages of specific natiocal origin groups.

This does not imply, however, that the point system is ineffective. An
alternative, though little diacossed, effect of the Faint system is to

reallocate visas across source countries. Cansidet, for instance, the
impact of the educational requirements in the point system. A visa
applicant is given 1 point per year of education, and only 50 points are

needed to "pass the test." Persons originating in countries with high mean -

educational

attainment are mote likely to qualify for entry into Canada than

petsons originating in countries with low educational attainment. The
population of the source countries differs suhstantially in mean education

levels. For instance, the average educational attainment is 3.2 years in
Haiti, 6.1 years in Mexico, 10.7 years in the United Kingdom, and 11.1 years

in France,12 It is likely, therefore, that the point system plays an
important role in determining the national origin six of the immigrant flow.
The extent to which the point system actually redistributes visas among

18

source countries has not been analyzed. As a preliminary way of
establishing this link, I calculated the frsction of isasigrants that

I

migrated

to Canado (our of the total number of immigrants into Canada and

the United StoLes) for 40 source countries in the late l970s. The
relationship between this choice" variable and moan educational attainment
in the source country is suauearized by:13

log[F/(1-P)] -

-2.3035

÷ .1971 S.

where P is the fraction of the Icusigrant flow that "chose' Canada; S ia the

mean educational attainment in the aource country; and the i-statistics are
reported in paranthoses. Equation (7) was cstimated using a aiuieum
grouped-logit estimator. Evalusted at the mcan probability, an incroasc of
one ycar in the average schooling, level of the suurca country incteases the
likelihood that imaigronts "choose' Canada by about 3.6 percentage points.

This prelioioary analysis thus suggests that the point system plays a
subtle, but ctucial, role:

it biases the admission of ireeigtonts towards

rational origin groups that originate in high-income, high-skill countriea
My findings imply that it is this feature of the point systers which Is
mostly

responsible for the different performance ci ituiiigrants in Canada ond

in the United States during the post-l963 period.14

systeo.1

In 1900-1981, nearly 850 thousand persons born in Conado resided

19

in the United States, and over 300

thousand

persons born in the United

States resided in Canada. The emigration of Americans accounted for 8

percent of the foreign-horn population in Canada, while the emigration of
Canadians accounted for 6 percent of the

foreign-born

population in the

United States.
Table 8 reports the mean educational attainment and relative wages for
several waves of iransnaiional migrants. These data yield several

interesting facts. Tn

general,

Cenadian immigrants in the United States do

quite well in the labor market. The most recent arrivals enumerated in Liie
1980 Census earn about 20 percent higher wages than American natives and

have about 2 years more schooling. Tn contrast, American immigrants in
Canada are less successful. The most recent arrivals enumerated in the 1981

Census earn 4.5 pernent loss than Canadian natives yet have 4.5 yaara gg
schooling.

in addition, the data indicate little growth in immigrant earnings over

time (relative to natives). For instance, the U.S. Census shows that the
rrsat recent arrivela enumerated in the 1970 Census had 14.9 percent higher

wages than natives. Ey

1980,

this differential had increaeed to only 17.2

percent. In Canada, the typical irmnigrant who arrived in the late 1960s

earned 30 percent more than natives in 1970, but earned only 10.6 percent

more than natives in 1980. There is little evidence of assinilation in
these data. In fact, the Canadian Census suggests the possibility of "disassimilation.
Finally, there was a sizable decline in skills among successive waves of

American immigrants in Canada, but an intrease among suncesaive waves of

Canadians in the United States. In 1970, the newly arrived Americans had

6.5 more years of schooling and earned 29 percent more than natives, but by
1980 the most recent American immigrants had 4.5 store years of schooling and

earned 4.5 percent less than natives, in contrast, the newly-arrived
Canadians enumerated by the 1970 U.S. Census had 1.4

more years of schooling

and 14.9 percent higher wages than natives, but the most recent Canadian
immigrants in 1980 had 1.9 more years of schooling and earned 20.2 percent
more than natives.

Some of the statistics in Table 8 may be contaminated by the migration
of draft avoiders tc Canada in the late l960s and early l970s. A
presidential pardon allowing their reentry into the United States was

declared in 1978. Because the empirical analysis below uses the 1971/1981
Canadian Censuses to track the wages of cchorts ci American migrants, it is
possible that the influx of the draft avoiders entatierated in the 1971

Canadian Census, and rheir possible return migration to the U.S. prior to
the 1981 Census, biases the analysis.
There are no reliable estimates of the number of draft avoiders, nor of

their return migration rates. The 1911 Canadian Census enumerated onLy 4800
American-bern young men (aged 18-25) who had migrated between 1946 and 1971.

The 1981 Canadian Census enumerated 4250 American-bern men aged 28-35 (who

had migrated in 1966-1971). Both the size ci this aigraticn flow and the
return migration rate are relatively small. it is unlikely, therefore, that
the migration of Vietnam draft avoiders is driving the results of the

analysis (and this ilow could certainly not explain the increasing skills of
Canadian iessigrants in the United States).
l7ithin each host country, the samples of natives and of transnational

migrants were used to estimate the earnings tunctions in (1) and (2). I

21

then predicted the (relative) eniry wage oE the tranenational migrants in

4

each of the host countries, as well as tha growth rate after 10 and 20 years
in the host country. These summary statistics are reported in Table 9.
The most tecent Canadian immigrants in the United States (i.e. the
1975-1980 wave) entercd the labor market with essentially the aaise wage as

natives, while the most recent Americans in Canada entered the Canadian
labor market with much lower wages than natives. This situation is quite

different from what wss observed in the early l9GOa. At that time, the most
recent Canadians in the United Stares had slightly lower wages titan natives
(though the difference was not statistically significant), while Americans
in Canada entered the labor market with much higher wages than natives.
The relatively better performance of recent Canadian immigrants in the
U.S. labor market stay be a result of a different selection process guiding
the migration of persons across the U.S. -Canada border. In earlier work
(Borjas, 1987), I argued that international differences in the rate of
return tn skills are the nain determinants of the skill composition of

immigrant flows. The results presented in Tables B and 9 are consistent
with this hypothesis if Canada has a lower rate of return to skills than the
United Stares. In fact, the available e'iidence suggests that the Canadian
income distribution is more compressed than that of the United States, so
that skilled Canadians are likely to have greater incentives to migrate to
the United States than unskilled Canadians (Mciatters and Beach, 1989).

Regardless of the validity of this hypothesis, the results presented in
this section suggest that the point aystem plays a much weaker role than

would have been presumed. Because of the skill filters explicitly built
into Canadian immigration policy end the absence of such filters in U.S.

immigrants in Canada would do well in the Canadian labor market and that

Canadian immigrants in the United States would be less successful. The
facts, however, are exactly the opposite. The self-selection generated by
the differential economic opportunities available to skilled and unskilled
workers in the two countries greatly dilutes the expected impact of Canada's
point system.

VII. Summary

-

Because immigration policies in Canada and the United Scares differ in
their objectives, the comparison of the economic impact of immigrants in the
two countries provides a benchmark for assessing the role played by pclicy

in determining the skill composition of the immigrant flow. This paper
presented a description of the trends in immigrant skills and labor market
performance in both Canada and the United States, and interpreted these
trends in terms of the underlying policy changes that occurred between 1960
and 1980 in both host countries.
The data provide a clear and unambiguous picture of the skills and labor

market perfotxance of immigrants in the two countries. Immigrants in Canada
are, on average, more skilled than immigrants in the United States, This
result is evident from comparisons of educational attainment, where
immigrants in Canada have about a year more schooling at the time of arrivai.

than immigrants in the United States, as well as in terss of immigrant
wages, where the wage disadvantsge of immigrants (relative to natives) is
substantially greater in the United States.

The empitical snalysis suggests a simple explsnstion for the skill

23

differential. The average skill level of specific national origin groups is
about the same in Canada and the United States, so that Canada's point
system does net attract more skilled workers from a given source country.
The national origin mix of the Canadian immigrant flow, however, is more

heavily weighted towards national origin groups that tend to perform well in
hoth the Canadian and U.S. labor warkets. It is this compositional effect
that HexplainsI most of the observed differences in the educational
attainment and wages of immigrants in Canada and the United States.
In effect, the point system works because it alters the national origin
mix of iremigtsnt flows. This finding has important, if unpalatable,
impticatlons fur the ongoing debate over the role that the skilla of visa
applicants should play in determining entry into Canada or the United

States. To a large extent, skill filters are effective because they alter
the allocation of visas across source countries. The data analyzed in this
paper, therefore, suggest an important tradeoff between the average skill

ltvel of immigrant flows and their ethnic diversity. The existence and
implications of this tradeoff are likely to play an important role in future
discussions of imnigratinn policy.

Abbott for useful comments and to the National Science Foundation (Grant No.
SES-880928l) for financial support.

1. There was also a sizable transnational migration between Canada and
the United States. The size and skill composition of this flows is
discussed in detail below.
2.

See Abbott sod Beach, 1987; Bloom and Gunderson, 1991; Borjaa,

1990s; Chiswick, 198]; and Tandon, 1978.

3. See Duleep and Regets (1990) For additional evidence that the skills
of immigrants from specific source countries vary little hetween Canada and
the United States.
4.

Borjas

(1990a) presents a comparative review of Canadian and U.S.

immigration policies. See also Boyd (1976) and Keeley and Elwell (1981).
5. The particular allocation of points discussed in the text became
effective in 1967.

6. The intervals reporting the imoligrant's year of entry into the host

country differ between the Canadian and U.S. Censuses. For the post-1960
cohorts, however, these variations are relatively unimportant. The
probabilities reported in Table 2 weigh the observations in each of the
Censuses so as to ensure that the underlying time period defining each
cohort has the same duration in the two host countries.

7, The 1910 U.S. native sample is a 1/1000 extract, while the 1980 U.S.
native sample is a 1/2500 extract.
8.

The growth rates are evaluated by calculating the slope of the ago

25

earnings profile at the relevant age end years-since-migration values. The
staristics reported in Table 4 differ slightly from those that can be
calculated from Tables A-i and A-2 because of rounding errors in the
reporting of the regression coefficients.
-

9.

The U.S. Censuses report many more source countries than the

Canadian Census. The main drawback of
specific

the

Canadian Census is that the

source country of Asian or Latin American immigrants is not

identified.
10.

Because

the dependent variables are

themselves estimates of the true

means, the regressions are estimated using generalized least squares. It is
worth noting, however, that the unweighted regressions lead to the same
qualitative conclusions as the CLS regressions.

11. These education data are reported in Borjas (l99l Tahle 2), and
give the average educational attainment of the population of the source
countries in the late 1970s.

12. It is of interest to determine the extent to which these findings
are driven by the presence of large numbers of relatively unskilled Latin
American immigrants in the United States.

I reeatimated the atatistics

reported in Table 7 after emitting the saiopie of Latin Americans from the

analysis. Suppose, for instance, that there were no Latin American
immigrants in

the

1975-1980 cohort in either Canada or the United States.

The average wage of immigrants would be - .144 in Canada and - .173 in the

United States, if Canada had the same national origin mix as the United
States, the predicted wage would be - .198, while if the United States had
the same national origin mix as Canada the predicted wage would be -

.099.

Therefore, the results indicate that, although Latin American immigrants in

t

26

the

United

States substantially reduce the average skill level of U.S.

immigrants, differences in the national origin composition of the immigrant
flow still favor Canada.
13.

The 40 countries included in this analysis are listed in Borjas

(1957).

14. The empirical analysis presented in Section IV also indicated a
sizable decline in skiiis among successive immigrant waves in both host

countries, with the decline being much steeper in the United States. I have
shown elsewhere (Borjas, 199Db) that much of the U.S. trend can be
attributed ic the changing national origin mix of immigrant flows.
Preliminary calculations (not reported) indicate that national origin plays
a weaker (though still important) role in explaining the declining skills of
immigrants in Canada.

15. These flows have long been of interest to Canadian demographers.
See Boyd (i9Bl). Lavoie (1972), and the many references in U.S. Department
of Commerce (1990).
