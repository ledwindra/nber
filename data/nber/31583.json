    "abstract": "\n\nWe propose a statistical model of heterogeneous beliefs where investors are represented as different machine learning model specifications. Investors form return forecasts from their individual models using common data inputs. We measure disagreement as forecast dispersion across investor-models (MFD). Our measure aligns with analyst forecast disagreement but more powerfully predicts returns. We document a large and robust association between belief disagreement and future returns. A decile spread portfolio that sells stocks with high disagreement and buys stocks with low disagreement earns a value-weighted return of 14% per year. Further analyses suggest MFD-alpha is mispricing induced by short-sale costs and limits-to-arbitrage.\n\n",
