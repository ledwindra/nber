ABSTRACT
In this paper, we develop the theoretical and empirical properties of a new class of multi-variate
GARCH models capable of estimating large time-varying covariance matrices, Dynamic Conditional
Correlation Multivariate GARCH. We show that the problem of multivariate conditional variance
estimation can be simplified by estimating univariate GARCH models for each asset, and then, using
transformed residuals resulting from the first stage, estimating a conditional correlation estimator. The
standard errors for the first stage parameters remain consistent, and only the standard errors for the
correlation parameters need be modified. We use the model to estimate the conditional covariance of up
to 100 assets using S&P 500 Sector Indices and Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks, and conduct
specification tests of the estimator using an industry standard benchmark for volatility models. This new
estimator demonstrates very strong performance especially considering ease of implementation of the
estimator.

Introduction

While univariate GARCH models have met with widespread empirical success, the problems associated with the estimation of multivariate GARCH models with time-varying correlations have
constrained researchers to estimating models with either limited scope or considerable restrictions.
Large time-varying covariance matrices are needed in portfolio management and optimization,
models of the term structure of treasuries or commodities, and large vector autoregressions. In
this paper we describe a model which can be used to estimate extremely large time-varying covariance matrices and describe the theoretical properties of the Dynamic Conditional Correlation
(DCC) Multivariate GARCH model, first introduced in Engle (2001). This class of MV-GARCH
models differs from other specifications in that univariate GARCH models are estimated for each
asset series, and then, using the standardized residuals resulting from the first step, a time varying
correlation matrix is estimated using a simple specification. This parameterization preserves the
simple interpretation of univariate GARCH models with an easy to compute correlation estimator.
This multi-stage estimation requires modifying the standard errors of the parameters, however the
Bollerslev-Wooldridge standard errors for each univariate GARCH model remain consistent, and
only the asymptotic covariance of the parameters of the correlation estimator need be modified.
Bollerslev, Engle and Wooldridge (1988) originally proposed the multivariate GARCH model in
the familiar half-vec (vech) form which provided a very general framework for multivariate volatility
models. The full unrestricted model requires O(k 4 ) parameters to be estimated by maximum
likelihood, where k is the number of time series being modelled. A simpler model, the diagonal
vech was also proposed which allows for non-zero coefficients only on own lagged effects and cross
products, reducing the numbers of parameters needing to be estimated to O(k 2 ). The diagonal
specification allows for a relatively straightforward interpretation, as each series has a GARCH-like
specification. However, deriving the restrictions necessary on the parameters to ensure the positive
definiteness of the conditional covariance becomes extremely difficult as k grows to even a moderate
size.
Bollerslev (1990) introduced the constant conditional correlation multivariate GARCH specification,where univariate GARCH models are estimated for each asset and then the correlation
matrix is estimated using the standard closed form MLE correlation estimator using transformed
residuals. The assumption of constant correlation makes estimating a large model feasible and ensures that the estimator is positive definite, simply requiring each univariate conditional variance
to be non-zero and the correlation matrix to be of full rank. However, the constant correlation
estimator, as proposed, does not provide a method to construct consistent standard errors using

2

the multi-stage estimation process. Bollerslev finds the notion of constant correlation plausible,
yet recent papers by Tsui and Yu (1999) have found that constant correlation can be rejected for
ceratin assets. Bera (1996) and Tse (2000) both have developed tests for constant correlation, the
former being a bivariate test while the latter is a more general multivariate LM test.
The BEKK formulation, proposed in Engle and Kroner (1995), developed a general quadratic
form for the conditional covariance equation which eliminated the problem of assuring the positive
definiteness of the conditional covariance estimate of the original vech model. In order for the
BEKK model to be fully general, the number of parameters needing to be estimated is O(k 4 ), but
a standard BEKK estimation will involve O(k 2 ) parameters. Other more tractable formulations of
the BEKK model include diagonal and scalar which place restrictions on certain parameters to be
equal to zero, although these restrictions are typically rejectable. In addition to the large number of
parameters needing to be estimated for the general form, the exact interpretation of the individual
coefficients is difficult to discern.
Recently, Alexander (2000) has demonstrated the use of factor GARCH models, as first outlined
Engle, Ng, and Rothschild (1990), for estimation of large covariance matrices. Factor or Orthogonal MV-GARCH models provide a method for estimating any dynamic covariance matrix using
only univariate GARCH models. Alexander shows how a limited number of factors can explain a
significant amount of the volatility in certain cases. However, this approach, while reducing the
numbers of parameters estimated to o(k), is limited by both the difficulty in interpreting the coefficients on the univariate GARCH models and the poor performance for less correlated systems
such as equities.
Engle (2001) proposed a new class of estimator that both preserves the ease of estimation of
Bollerslev’s constant correlation model yet allows for correlations to change over time. Dynamic
Conditional Correlation MV-GARCH preserves the parsimony of univariate GARCH models of individual assets’ volatility with a simple GARCH-like time varying correlation. Further, the number
of parameters estimated using maximum likelihood is O(k), a considerable improvement over both
the vech and the BEKK models. More importantly, the number of parameters requiring simultaneous estimation is O(1). The focus of the current paper is to explore both the theoretical and
empirical properties of the DCC MV-GARCH model when estimating large conditional covariance
matrices.
Tse and Tsui (1998) have also proposed a dynamic correlation multivariate GARCH model,
however no attempt has been made to allow for separate estimation of the univariate GARCH
processes and the dynamic correlation estimator. In addition, by not allowing for reversion to the
unconditional correlation in the correlation estimator, the number of parameters needing to be
3

simultaneously estimated is O(k 2 ), and is only slightly less than the typical BEKK formulation.
While this estimator does possess a straight forward interpretation of the coefficients, it still will
require simultaneous estimation of 32 parameters in a 5 asset model, and 167 parameters in a 15
asset model.
The paper is organized as follows. The second section outlines the model in detail and discusses
the estimation procedure used. Section three establishes the asymptotic consistency and normality
of the parameters, discusses the modified mispecification robust standard errors, provides a modified
likelihood-ratio test that is valid under either two stage estimation or model mispecification, and
discusses using a one-step Newton-Raphson iteration to achieve full efficiency. Section four describes
an easy to implement test for constant correlation requiring only the estimation of a restricted VAR.
Section five describes the data used and provides empirical results where systems with up to 100
assets are estimated. In section six specification checks and benchmark comparisons are conducted,
section seven describes multi-step forecasting with the DCC model, and section eight concludes and
outlines area of future research.

Model

The multivariate GARCH model proposed assumes that returns from k assets are conditionally
multivariate normal with zero expected value and covariance matrix Ht .1 The returns can be
either mean zero or the residuals from a filtered time series.2
rt |Ft−1 ∼ N (0, Ht )
and
Ht ≡ Dt Rt Dt
where Dt is the k × k diagonal matrix of time varying standard deviations from univariate GARCH
√
models with hit on the ith diagonal, and Rt is the time varying correlation matrix. The loglikelihood of this estimator can be written:
1

The assumptions of multivariate normality is not required for consistency and asymptotic normality of the

estimated parameters. When the returns have non-Gaussian innovations, the DCC estimator can be interpreted as a
quasi-maximum likelihood estimator.
2
The standard errors of the model will not depend on the choice of filtration (ARMA, demeaning), as the cross
partial derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to the mean and the variance parameters has expectation zero
when using the normal likelihood.

The following useful result from

linear algebra simplifies finding the necessary conditions for Rt to be positive definite and hence a

Proposition 1 (Positive Definiteness) A square matrix, A, is positive definite if and only if
B = A∗ −1 AA∗ −1 ,as defined above, is positive definite.
Proof: See Appendix
Proposition 1 establishes that for positive definiteness of Rt , we only need to ensure Qt is
positive definite. Applying this proposition, we can describe a set of sufficient conditions for Ht to
be uniformly positive definite.

restrictions (Equation 1) are satisfied for all asset series i ∈ [1, . . . , k]:
a. ωi > 0

Then Ht will be positive definite for all t.
Proof: Each hit will be strictly positive as each is a sum of (weakly)positive parts, with ωi strictly
positive. Qt will be positive definite for all t as it is a weighted average of a positive definite matrix
(Q̄), a positive semi-definite matrices (²²0t ) and a positive definite matrices Qt−1 , and Q0 is positive
definite by Assumption h.
Essentially, the requirements for positive definiteness of the conditional covariance are the same
for the DCC model as for a univariate GARCH process. The restrictions on parameters in Proposition 2 are not necessary, only sufficient to guarantee positive definiteness for Ht .

Estimation and Standard Errors

The DCC model was designed to allow for two stage estimation, where in the first stage univariate GARCH models are estimated for each residual series, and in the second stage, residuals,
transformed by their standard deviation estimated during the first stage, are used to estimate the
parameters of the dynamic correlation. The likelihood used in the first stage involves replacing
Rt with Ik , an identity matrix of size k. Let the parameters of the model, θ, be written in two
groups (φ1 , φ2 , . . . , φk , ψ) = (φ, ψ), where the elements of φi correspond to the parameters of the
univariate GARCH model for the ith asset series, φi = (ω, α1i , . . . , αPi i , β1i , . . . , βQi i ). The resulting
first stage quasi-likelihood function is:

Since we are conditioning on φ̂, the only portion of the log-likelihood that will influence the
parameter selection is log(|Rt |) + ²0t Rt−1 ²t , and in estimation of the DCC parameters, it is often

Newey and McFadden (1994) have provided a proof for the asymptotic distribution for twostage GMM estimators. The proofs for consistency and asymptotic normality of the parameter
estimates of the two stage DCC estimator closely follow the results presented for GMM. The
following set assumptions are sufficient to establish the consistency of the parameters estimated
using this two stage procedure, in addition to standard assumptions guaranteeing the completeness
of the probability space and measurability of the quasi-likelihood functions.
A 1 θ0 = (φ0 , ψ0 ) is interior in Θ = Φ × Ψ, and Θ is compact, and θ0 satisfies the conditions of
Proposition 2.
A 2 φ0 uniquely maximizes E[ln f1 (r, φ)] (Equation 3) and ψ0 uniquely maximizes E[ln f2 (r, θ)]
(Equation 7) where r = (r1 , ...rt ) is a strictly stationary, ergodic series.
A 3 ln f1 (r, φ) and ln f2 (r, φ, ψ), the first and second stage quasi log-likelihoods, are twice continuously differentiable on θ0 .
A 4 E[supφ∈Φ k ln f1 (r, φ)k] and E[supθ∈Θ k ln f2 (r, θk] exist and are finite.

Theorem 1 (Consistency) Under assumptions A1 - A4, φ̂n → φ0 and (φ̂n , ψ̂)n = θ̂n → θ0 .
Details of the proof can be found in Newey and McFadden. The conditions for consistency are
very weak and will be satisfied by numerous data generating processes. We now will add sufficient
regularity conditions to allow for asymptotic normality of the estimated parameters. The following
two additional assumptions are needed for this result:
A 5 (i)E[∇φ ln f1 (rt , φ0 )] = 0 and E[k∇φ ln f1 (rt , φ0 )k2 ] < ∞
(ii)E[∇θ ln f2 (rt , θ0 )] = 0 and E[k∇θ ln f2 (rt , θ0 )k2 ] < ∞
A 6 (i) A11 = E[∇φφ ln f1 (rt , φ0 )] is O (1) and negative definite.
(ii) A22 = E[∇ψψ ln f2 (rt , θ0 )] is O (1) and negative definite.
Using these assumptions the following theorem establishes the asymptotic distribution of the
two stage estimation process used in estimating DCC-MVGARCH models.

Following from the theorem, the asymptotic variance of θ̂n is given by A0 −1 B0 A0 −1 . Applying the partitioned inverse theorems for square matrices, the asymptotic variances of the GARCH
parameters for each asset, φ̂n are the standard Bollerslev-Wooldridge robust covariance matrix
estimators given by A0 11 −1 B0 11 A0 11 −1 .5 The asymptotic variance of the second stage DCC parameters is however a much more complicated formula involving all of the parameters. Further,
the asymptotic variance of the parameters is (weakly) greater in this case than would be the case
where A0 φψ was a zero matrix, due to the loss of efficiency in estimating the parameters separately.
In addition to having modified standard errors, a likelihood-ratio test with r restrictions will
not typically be χ2r . Both Foutz and Srivastave (1977) and Liang and Self (1996) have discussed
likelihood ratio testing when either the distributional assumption is incorrect or a model is estimated
in multiple steps. Both of these results demonstrate when the Information Matrix Equality does not
p

hold, i.e. A0 − B0 9 0, then the asymptotic distribution will be a weighted sum of r independent
χ21 variables where the weights will not necessarily be unity. In this case, where the limiting
distribution of the parameters is known (Theorem 2), Foutz and Srivastave have shown that to test
the null of H0 : θ ∈ Θr against H1 : θ ∈ Θ that

upper r × r matrix of Ã−1 B̃ Ã−1 , where Ã is A, as defined in theorem 2, with the rows and columns
of the restricted parameters interchanged, so that the first r rows and columns of Ã correspond to
the standard errors of the restricted parameters being tested and B̃ is similarly defined. In testing
one restriction, we have (W (θ0 )M (θ0 ))−1 λ̂ ∼ χ21 . Another useful result is that the expectation

Proof: See Appendix
While the parameters are consistent and asymptotically normal with a known covariance, they
are not fully efficient as both sets of parameters are estimated using LIML. However, due a result
from Pagan (1986) and others, we know that when an estimate is root-n consistent, that a fully
efficient estimate requires only one step using a Newton-Raphson algorithm that involves using
the second stage likelihood to obtain consistent estimate first and second derivatives.6 Lemma one
gives an exact statement of the one step efficiency for the DCC estimator.

Testing for Constant Correlation

One of the primary motivations for this paper is that the correlations between assets are not constant
through time. Testing models for constant correlation has proven to be a difficult problem, as
testing for dynamic correlation with data that have time-varying volatilities can result in misleading
conclusions, which can lead to rejecting constant correlation when it is true due to misspecified
volatility models. Tse (1998), testing a null of constant conditional correlation against an ARCH in
correlation alternative, and Bera (1996), testing a null of constant conditional correlation against a
diffuse alternative, have provided test statistics for testing a null of constant correlation against an
alternative of a dynamic correlation structure. One short coming of both of these tests is that they
do not generalize well to higher dimensions. We propose a test that only requires consistent estimate
of the constant conditional correlation, and can be implemented using a vector autoregression.
6

Estimates of the can be easily computed form the second stage likelihood function numerically.

10

We are interested in testing the null of constant correlation against an alternative of dynamic
conditional correlation. However, there is a significant difficulty in conducting this test as the
decay parameters (βi ) in the DCC estimator are unidentified under the standard null hypothesis
and must be treated as nuisance parameters. There are two ways to treat this. One is to merely
test the null against an alternative with a specific coefficient for beta β. This test can be conducted
using standard likelihood ratio test with the usual properties of LR testing holding, however it may
lack power if the chosen coefficient for β is far form the truth. However, this is an unnecessarily
restrictive test as it should not be necessary to identify β. Andrews and Ploberger (1994) establish
a procedure by which tests with unidentified parameters can be conducted and only recently has
this framework been extended to cases where the parameter unidentified under the null can be on
the boundary of the parameter space. Implementing this type of test is very difficult as it requires
many optimizations and monte carlo critical values. The test we propose is
H0 : Rt = R̄

∀t ∈ T

against
Ha : vech(Rt ) = vech(R̄) + β1 vech(Rt−1 ) + β2 vech(Rt−1 ) + . . . βp vech(Rt−1 )
The testing procedure is as follows. Estimate the univariate GARCH processes and standardize the residuals for each series. Then estimate the correlation of the standardized residuals,
and jointly standardize the vector of univariate standardized residuals by the symmetric square
root decomposition of the R̄.7

Under the null of constant correlation, these residuals should

be IID with a variance covariance matrix given by Ik .8 The artificial regressions will be a regression of the outer products of the residuals on a constant and lagged outer products. Let
£
¤
Yt = vechu (R̄−1/2 Dt−1 rt )(R̄−1/2 Dt−1 rt )0 − Ik where R̄−1/2 Dt−1 rt is a k by 1 vector of residuals
jointly standardized under the null, and vechu is a modified vech which only selects elements above
the diagonal. The vector autoregression is
Yt = α + β1 Yt−1 + . . . + βs Yt−s + ηt
7

While the E(²t ²0t ) is a correlation matrix, in finite samples this is never going to occur. In practice it is more

efficient to use R̄ as the covariance matrix in place of the correlation matrix. By using a correlation matrix, the test
is further weakened as the test is also sensitive to the standardized variance of the univariate GARCH processes not
being unity.
8
A limitation of this test is that it cannot differentiate from a dynamic correlation structure and misspecified
conditional heteroscedasticity of the univariate series. However, this test is designed to test if the standardized
residuals have a constant correlation, and not necessarily if the DGP has a constant correlation.

11

Under the null the constant and all of the lagged parameters in the model should be zero.
In order to estimate the test statistic, all that is necessary to do is to make the T × 1 vector of
outer-products for each univariate regressand and the T × s + 1 matrix of regressors including
the constant for each set of regressors. Then the parameters can be estimated by stacking the
k(k − 1)/2 vectors of regressands and regressors and performing a seemingly unrelated regression.
The test can then be conducted as

δ̂X 0 X δ̂ 0
σ̂ 2

which is asymptotically χ2(s+1) , where δ̂ are the estimate

regression parameters.9 In every model considered in this paper, we reject the null of a constant
correlation in favor of a dynamic structure.

Empirical Results

The data used in this paper consist of 100 S&P 500 Sector Indices including the S&P 500 Composite
and the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks plus the average. Both data series were from
January 1, 1994 until December 31, 1999, and were provided by Datastream. All days that the
market was closed were removed, with the number of days removed being either eight or nine,
depending on the year.10 After removing these days there were 1509 observations for the sample.
The model used in the empirical section was a simple DCC (1,1)-MVGARCH where each of
the univariate GARCH models estimated for the conditional variances was selected by finding the
minimum of the AIC allowing for P < 4 and Q < 3.11 In addition, an integrated form of this model
was estimated where λ = 1 − β = α was imposed. The models were built in an expanding fashion
so that the three asset model included the assets of the two asset model plus an additional asset,
the four asset model nested the three asset model, and so forth.12
Table 1 summarizes the estimated α̂ and β̂ of the mean reverting model for different numbers of
assets using the S&P indices, as well as the value of the statistic derived from a corrected likelihood
ratio test that tests H0 : α = 1 − β and thus the correlations have an integrated structure. T-stats
are reported for each coefficient using the mispecification robust standard errors in parenthesis.
Table 1 also reports the estimated λ̂ and reports the modified LR statistic of the test of the null
9

If the covariance of the standardized residuals is used in place of the correlation, the intercept will necessarily be

zero, and the test could be conducted as (k)(k − 1)T R2 from the regression which should be χ2(s) .
10
There were at least 8 days removed each year:New Year’s Day, President’s Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day,
Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. In addition in 1994, the markets were closed
for President Nixon’s funeral, and in 1998 and 1999, the markets were closed on Martin Luther King’s Day

The data were not filtered other than simple subtraction of the mean.

The S&P 500 was included as the first asset for the models estimated S&P 500 data with the remaining assets

of an integrated model against an alternative of a mean reverting model.13 For every model with
more than six assets, the estimated λ̂ was on the boundary, and the test statistic is most likely
not distributed χ21 .14 Also, the mean reverting model was preferred to the integrated model for
all data sets, with the rejection of the integrated model occurring at the 0.1% level for all models.
The estimated parameters imply a highly persistent correlation, with a half-life of innovation of 21
days for the 10 asset model.
Table 2 presents the estimated parameters for the Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks. All of
the coefficients of the mean reverting models were significant at the 5% level, with most significant
at the 1% level. The estimated integrated parameter λ̂ was in all instances estimated at the
boundary of 0. The typical estimated set of parameters had slow decay (β̂ > .97) with a small
news parameter (α̂ < .01). For all models, we reject the null of constant correlation in favor of
dynamic conditional correlation at the 1% level based on the likelihood ratio test statistic.
To insure that the expanding data sets used in estimation were not driving the results that
the parameters seem to settle down and are contained in a fairly narrow range, we estimated a
10 models where the data series were chosen at random from the 100 data series of the S&P 500
indices used in the paper. Figure 1 contains the estimated α̂ and β̂ for the ten models. The α̂ range
from 0.004 to 0.013 while the β̂ range from 0.86 to 0.98. None of the models produced parameters
which were constrained on the boundary of α + β ≤ 1. Comparing this to the estimated coefficient
of 0.0255 and 0.9410 for the 10 asset model estimated using the S&P 500 indices, these have a
slightly less dynamic structure and generally more persistence, most likely due to the correlation
structure of the different sector indices and the S&P 500 index. We also estimated the integrated
model on these same ten pairs of assets, finding the estimated parameter to be on the boundary for
all but one of the models. For the one set of assets where the integrated model did not estimate the
parameter on the boundary, the null of an integrated was rejected in favor of an alternative mean
reverting model at 0.001%. We feel that the evidence does not provide support for the integrated
version as all models considered preferred the mean reverting model using the LR test. In writing
this paper, we considered using a longer sample of 10 years. When estimating models with ten
years of data, we found that the integrated model typically had a coefficient that was significantly
different from zero, although the mean reverting model was preferred to the integrated model for
this data length as well. One possible explanation for this phenomena is that there are breaks
13

The nuisance parameter is only present for the test of the mean reverting model against an alternative of a

constant correlation, and is not present for either the null of an integrated model against the alternative of constant
correlation, or a null of mean reverting against an alternative of an integrated model.

When λ̂ = 0, the test can be interpreted as a test of H0 : α = 0, β = 0 against a DCC.

in the unconditional correlation, which allow the integrated model to fit better than a constant
correlation model over longer horizons. This line of research is beyond the scope of this paper, and
will be saved for future work.
Finally, we estimated a variety of specifications for the DCC model, allowing for more lags of
both the news term (α) and the decay term (β). Table 3 contains the corrected likelihood ratio
results for the for both the S&P and the Dow assets. The models estimated were DCC (2,1),
DCC (2,2), and DCC (3,2), where the first number represents the number of α lags included. The
models of the Dow assets never preferred a longer lag length, with most parameters estimated as
zero. The likelihoods improved when using the (3,2) specification, however none were significant.
The original specification was always preferred to the (2,1) specification for all S&P assets models.
The DCC (2,2) was preferred to the DCC (1,1) for the 25 asset model, and 10 of the 12 models
estimated with the DCC (3,2) rejected the null of a DCC (1,1) process. However, upon inspection
of the fitted correlations, the larger models typically generated correlation which were much noisier
than the original model, although with dynamics that remained the same.
Figure 2 contains a plot of the cumulative returns of 4 S&P 500 indices, while figure 3 plot
the time-varying correlations of the S&P 500 composite and 3 sector indices. The correlations
range form 0.2 to 0.8 over the course of the sample. Figure 4 contains the estimated variances
and covariances for these stocks over the sample period. The variances for each series are simply
the result of the univariate GARCH specifications. Figure 5, contains the minimum variance
portfolio weights for these same four assets.15 For the first 3 years of the sample, the weights are
relatively constant with a high loading in the S&P 500 index and slight shorts in most of the others.
However, in the latter periods of the sample, the weights become extremely volatile and include a
short position in the S&P 500 index and greater the 1 weight in the S&P 500 Auto Parts index.
Figure 6 contains the dynamic correlations of the first four Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks.
Consistent with the smaller news parameter estimated for this model, the conditional correlations
are less volatile than the four asset S&P 500 model. However, there do appear to be periods where
the correlation is above the unconditional correlation for hundreds of days.

Specification Testing

In order to test the specification of the DCC model, we propose to examine the model’s performance
using three methods: the standard deviation of portfolios of returns standardized by the portfolio
standard deviation implied by the conditional variance estimate, Value-at-Risk performance, and
15

The procedure used to construct minimum variance weights is discussed in section 6.

14

relative performance to the industry standard RiskMetrics exponential smoother. The first test we
conducted involved testing the variance of returns of portfolios against the predicted variance. We
use three different portfolio weighting methods: equally weighted, value weighted, and minimum
variance portfolio weighted. The minimum variance portfolio is of particular interest as the weights
on the assets are determined by the estimated variance covariance matrix. We feel that if a
particular estimated conditional covariance estimate is misspecified, that the minimum variance
portfolio should exacerbate the short coming. The time-varying weights on the minimum variance
portfolio were calculated using
wt =

Ht−1 ι
Ct

where
Ct ≡ ι0 Ht−1 ι
and where Ht is the one-step ahead forecast of the conditional covariance constructed at time t − 1,
and ι is a k by 1 vector of ones. There was no limit on short selling, however no portfolio ever took
an extreme position. The portfolio weights of the value weighted portfolio were calculated using
the following formula:
wt+1 =

wt (1 + rt )
(1 + rt )0 ι

where rt is a k by 1 vector of time t asset returns with w0 = k −1 ι. Finally a simple equally weighted
portfolio was used where the weights were wt = k −1 ι. If the model was correctly specified for the
conditional covariance, then we would expect that the variance of any portfolio with weights wt
would be wt0 Ht wt . To test this hypothesis we used a symmetric confidence interval with α/2 probability in each tail.16 Portfolio variances which are too small relative to the predicted variance are
indication of excess correlation while variances which are too big indicate underestimation of the
correlation. When standardized by their estimated standard deviations, all assets had standardized (by univariate GARCH processes) residual variance that were in the 95% confidence interval
centered at 1 for both the S&P 500 indices and the DJIA stocks. The RiskMetrics EWMA variance
estimator is
Ht = .06et e0t + .94Ht−1
where H0 can be taken to be the sample covariance matrix or a presample data selection to begin
the smoother. The primary advantage of the RiskMetrics model is that it is extremely easy to

estimate, given that it has no parameters to estimate. According to RiskMetrics, the parameter
choice has been calibrated using extensive model selection. The obvious drawback to the model is
that it has no estimated parameters, and that it forces all assets have the same smoothing coefficient
(.94) irrespective of the type of asset. The RiskMetrics model is widely used in industry, especially
for portfolio Value-at-Risk.
For the S&P 500 indices, the minimum variance portfolio proved to be troublesome for both the
mean reverting DCC estimator and the industry standard RiskMetrics EWMA. The standardized
variances of the minimum variance portfolios only fall with in the confidence interval for portfolios
under 5 assets using the DCC estimator, while the predicted variance of the RiskMetrics model is
uniformly too small, resulting in a portfolio standard deviation 35 times larger than what would
have been expected. For the equally weighted and value weighted portfolios, the DCC estimator
produced portfolio standard deviations insignificantly different from one for all portfolios. Further,
we reject the null that the variance is equal to one for all of the RiskMetrics generated portfolios
using equally weighting or value weighting at the 5% level. Table 4 summarizes the results for
models estimated on the S&P 500 indices.
The performance of the DCC estimator on the DJIA stocks was similar. We reject the null
that the portfolio variance is one for all of the RiskMetrics portfolios, and for the larger DCC
generated minimum variance portfolio. We are also not able to reject the hypothesis that the
portfolio standard deviations are unity for any of the value or equally weighted portfolio variances as
estimated by the DCC model. The slight better performance of DCC and slightly worse performance
of the RiskMetrics model is most likely due to the larger news parameters of the RiskMetrics model
(λ = .06). These tests on the DCC estimator show for many portfolio strategies it performs well
at fitting the portfolio variance, although the structure of the dynamics of the correlation may
need more to allow for more then one news parameter as the size of the portfolio grows. Table 5
summarizes the results of the portfolio variance diagnostic test for the DJIA stocks.
The second measure of performance used to test the empirical validity of the models was the
HIT test (Engle and Manganelli (2000)). The test is designed to test the performance of a model’s
prediction of Value-at-Risk. A series of HITs is defined as a binary variable, 1[rt <V aR(q)] , where a
hit is a return below the forecasted Value-at-Risk and q is the VaR quantile. Under the null of a
correctly specified model for Value-at-Risk, the HITs should have mean q and should independent
of everything in the conditioning information set, including lagged HITs. An artificial regression
can be constructed to test both the mean and the independence of the HITs using OLS:
HITt − q = δ0 + δ1 HITt−1 + δ2 HITt−2 + . . . + δr HITt−r + δr+1 V aRt + νt
16

The artificial regression tests the independence of a HIT from past hits and form the predicted
Value-at-Risk (which is in the time t − 1 information set).17 We constructed one step ahead
forecasts of the variance of a portfolio using the mean reverting DCC model. The 5% VaR was
defined as −1.65σ̂p where σ̂p is the forecasted portfolio standard deviation. Under the assumption
that returns are conditionally multivariate normal, this level would be appropriate. However,
all of the standardized residuals from either the S&P 500 indices or the Dow stocks reject the
null of normality using a Jarque-Bera test at the 5% level. This leptokurtosis of the univariate
returns would invalidate using the −1.65σ̂p as a test for the number of HITs. We found that when
including the constant term in the artificial regression, we were able to reject the null of a correct
VaR model for all cases. Thus, in the test conducted, we tested for independence of the HITs
without simultaneously testing if the percentage of HITs was correct by excluding the constant and
replacing q with q̂,the mean number of HITs at −1.65σ̂p . The DCC model results in a consistently
lower percentage of HITs when estimated on equally weighted portfolios of S&P 500 indices data
(Table 6). Further, even with the mean of the HITs subtracted, there was still serial correlation in
the HITs when modelled on the past 5 HITs and the forecasted VaR. The VaR performance on the
minimum variance portfolio varies from slightly better to considerably worse, with nearly 5% for
smaller portfolios to 10% when estimated on all 100 indices. This is consistent with the estimated
variance performance of the DCC on the minimum variance portfolio significantly underestimating
the variances as the number of assets increased.
The performance of the DCC model using the HIT test was better for the Dow Jones stocks
than it was for the S&P 500 indices. However, the DCC again consistently underestimated the
number of violations of Value-at-Risk for the equally weighted portfolio at the 5% level. Table 6
contains the results of the HIT testing for the DJIA 30 stocks. The performance relative to the 1%
level is much more accurate, usually falling within 20% of the anticipated level.18 The probabilities
the HITs are independent was also better for all portfolios, however for the largest portfolios the
HITs seem to be correlated with past hits and/or contemporaneous VaR. The performance of the
minimum variance portfolio was generally worse than the equally weighted portfolio with respect
to the percentage of HITs, but better with regards to the probability of independence. We fail to
reject the null of independence of the HITs for none of the 14 portfolios at the 5% level using the
minimum variance portfolio.
17

This is the out of sample version of the HIT test as presented in Engle and Manganelli. As noted in their paper,

the distribution of the HITs is not known when the same data are used for fitting the model and evaluating the HIT
test, although this test is still a useful diagnostic.
18
However this difference was still significant at the 5% level.

17

The final specification test we used was to compare the results of the DCC estimator against
the estimator used widely by practitioners, the RiskMetrics exponential smoother. The comparison
was conducted using 4 criteria. The first criterion examines the percentage of HITs predicted
with each model using the equally weighted portfolio. The RiskMetrics estimator consistently
outperformed the DCC estimator in terms of the correct percentage of hits. The RiskMetrics filter
using S&P 500 indices data also performs slightly better on the HIT test, however the performance
of both estimators is inadequate by this metric, with both series having at least 11 out of 15 series
failing independence at the 5% level. A second criteria is the percentage of multivariate variance
standardized residuals which have variance in a confidence interval of one. The test relies on the
assumption that assets are multivariate normal, so
− 12

rt |Ft−1 ∼ N (0, Ht ) ⇒ Ht

rt |Ft−1 ∼ N (0, I)

The DCC estimator produced standardized residuals in the range for all models with less than
10 assets, and performed well in this metric for larger models. The RiskMetrics model produced
no standardized series in the 95% confidence interval for all of the models. This is consistent
with the standardized portfolio variance of Table 3 where the RiskMetrics estimator consistently
underestimated true variance. The final test was a Ljung-Box Q test at lag 15 of the residual to
determine if there was excess serial correlation in the squares and cross products of the covariance
standardized residuals using a 5% significance level. We found that percentage of cross products
failing (there were (k × k + 1)/2 cross products for a given number of assets k) was relatively small
for the DCC estimator for assets with models with fewer than 10 assets , with 15% typically failing
the test for serial correlation for larger models. The RiskMetrics model standardized residual
consistently performed worse, having over 40% of the residuals failing this test for the largest
models. We also found that the percentage failing was always greater than the 5% which would
have been expected with the test at the 5% level.
The Value-at-Risk calculation using the DJIA stocks performed similarly to the S&P Indices,
with the percentage of HITs being consistently under estimated for the equally weighted portfolios
and with the RiskMetrics estimator was always closer to the expected percentage of HITs for all but
one portfolio. In addition, the HITs generated by the RiskMetrics model only fail the independence
test for one of the 15 portfolios at the 1% level, while 7 out of the 15 DCC generated portfolios
fail the independence test at that level. However, for all assets and sizes of the models, with the
exception of one asset in the 31 asset model, the standard deviations of the returns standardized
by the square root of the estimated covariance were always in the confidence interval for the DCC
estimator. In addition, the DCC estimator significantly outperformed the RiskMetrics estimator in
18

terms of performance of the Ljung-Box Q-statistics in the outer products, having fewer series fail
for dependance at the lag 15 than the RiskMetrics model, usually by at least a factor of two. This
provides strong evidence in favor of the DCC model over the RiskMetrics model for assets with a
less dynamic correlation structure.
Overall, the DCC estimator performs very well. While it is not possible to directly compare the
DCC and the constant conditional correlation multivariate models using LR statistics due to an
unidentified parameter, even allowing 2 degrees of freedom, the corrected likelihood ratio statistics
using S&P index data are always greater than 80 which corresponds to a p-value of less than .001%.
The larger models estimated with the Dow Jones data also have very large likelihood ratio statistics,
typically greater then 50. The standard deviations of portfolios were also fit much better using
the DCC than the RiskMetrics model, resulting in no rejections of the null of a portfolio standard
deviation of 1 for the value or equally weighted portfolios using the S&P index data or the Dow
Jones stocks. The RiskMetrics estimator performed especially poor using the minimum variance
portfolios, possibly due to the correlation dynamics imposed by the choice of smoothing parameter.
Figure 7 contains a graph of the correlations estimated using the DCC model and the RiskMetrics
smoother for the 4 asset S&P 500 model. The RiskMetrics produced correlations are much more
volatile and imply that the correlation matrix was nearly singular at certain points in time. Further,
the DCC estimator produced multivariate standardized residuals in a confidence interval of one for
all models with less than 10 assets, and never had a rejection rate greater than 14%, while the
RiskMetrics model never produced multivariate standardized residuals in the confidence interval.
Finally, the DCC estimator typically produces residuals with less serial dependence at lag 15 then
the RiskMetrics estimator using a Ljung-Box Q statistics on the standardized outer-products of
the residuals.

Multi-Step Ahead Forecasting

Forecasting covariances is a requirement of GARCH models. Most GARCH models provide an easy
to implement method to generate r-step ahead forecasts. For instance, the r-step ahead forecast
of a standard GARCH (1,1) is given by
ht+r =

r−2
X

ω(α + β)i + (α + β)r−1 ht+1

i=1

However, the DCC evolution process is a non-linear process, where
Qt+r = (1 − α − β)Q̄ + α[²t+r−1 ²0t+r−1 ] + βQt+r−1
19

where Et [²t+r−1 ²0t+r−1 ] = Et [Rt+r−1 ] and Rt+r = Q∗t+r −1 Qt+r Q∗t+r −1 . Thus, the r-step ahead
forecast of the correlation cannot be directly solved forward to provide a convenient method for
forecasting. In examining methods to overcome this difficulty, two forecasts seem to be the most
natural, each requiring a difference set of approximations. The first technique proposed would be
to generate the r-step ahead forecast of Q by making the approximation that Et [²t+1 ²0t+1 ] ≈ Qt+1
for i ∈ [1, . . . , r]. Using this approximation, we then have the r-step ahead forecast of Qt is
Et [Qt+r ] =

r−2
X
(1 − α − β)Q̄(α + β)i + (α + β)r−1 Qt+1
i=0

and Rt+r = Q∗t+r −1 Qt+r Q∗t+r −1 . An alternative approximation would be that Q̄ ≈ R̄ and that
Et [Qt+1 ] ≈ Et [Rt+1 ]. Using this approximation, we can forecast Rt+r directly using the relationship
Et [Rt+r ] =

r−2
X
(1 − α − β)R̄(α + β)i + (α + β)r−1 Rt+1
i=0

In order to test which of these approximations performs best (if either), a Monte Carlo experiment was conducted. In the monte carlo, 1000 days of bivariate normal data were simulated
using α = .01, β = .98, and varying the unconditional correlation over the set [−0.8, −0.5, 0, 0.35,
0.5, 0.65, 0.8, 0.9]. At the 750th observation, Q750 , r750 , and R750 were saved. Forecasts were then
constructed for days 751 through 1000 using the two methods described above. In order to study
these two forecasting techniques, we treated α̂ β̂, and R̄ as known, setting each parameter to the
value used to simulate the data, to avoid the effects of parameter estimation uncertainty. With
these parameters, the half life of an innovation would be 68 days. Figure 8 contains a plot of the
bias of the two forecasting methods. The first observation is that both of the forecasting techniques
produce forecasts with a very small bias. This bias is generally toward 1 (or -1 for the series with
negative unconditional correlation). The forecast produced by solving forward for Qt+r (the dashdotted line) was always closer to 1 (or -1) and consequently more biased. The method for solving
Rt+r forward had better bias properties for almost all correlations and horizons. Also of interest
is that both forecasts appear to be unbiased when the unconditional correlation is zero, and that
they make essentially the same forecast when the unconditional correlation is zero.
Figure 9 contains a plot of the ratio of the MSFE of the forecast produced by solving Rt forward
directly divided by the forecast produced by solving Qt forward, then transforming the final Qt+r
to a correlation matrix. Neither forecast seems to produce uniformly less MSFE of the first fifty
days. For certain unconditional correlations, the forecast which solves Qt forward produces better
MSE (represented by a value greater than 1), yet this performance is hardly uniform. The ratio of
20

the MSFEs is extremely close to 1, despite the lower bias produced by the Rt forecast because the
bias squared was typically at least three orders of magnitude smaller than the variance. Finally,
figure 10 contains a fan plot of the density of the forecast errors. Two observations can be made
from this figure. First, as the unconditional approaches 1 (or -1), the variance of the forecast
errors decreases. Second, the amount of skewness in the distribution of errors increases as the
unconditional correlation increases. This is not surprising given that correlations are bounded
between 1 and -1. While neither of these two techniques significantly outperformed the other, it
would seem that a logical choice for forecasting would be the method that directly solves forward
Rt . Not only is this method easier to implement, it appears that it also suffers less bias.

Conclusion

This paper presents a class of estimators which join the simplicity and empirical success of univariate
GARCH processes with an easy to estimate and interpret dynamic correlation estimator. A two
step estimator is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal and a consistent estimator
of standard errors is provided. These depend on the cross partial derivatives of the second stage
likelihood with respect to the first and second stage parameters in addition to the typical BollerslevWooldridge robust standard errors. Ensuring the positive definiteness of the estimator is also
shown to be easy to achieve as it simply requires using the same restrictions as univariate GARCH
processes, and in the DCC(1,1) case could be treated as a scalar BEKK model for the correlation
using the standard quadratic form to allow estimation without lower bounds on the parameters. In
addition to the two stage process, a fully efficient estimation procedure is outlined which involves
a single Newton-Raphson step from the original consistent estimates.
A simple test is presented to test the null of constant correlation against an alternative of
dynamic conditional correlation. This test involves running a simple restricted VAR which can
be easily estimated by OLS. Specification testing provided a solid picture that this estimator is
comparable in performance to the industry standard benchmark RiskMetrics for large models and
outperforms RiskMetrics model for small size volatility models. We also feel that this estimator
could be easily improved upon by considering different parameterizations of the conditional correlation estimator, although this is beyond the scope of the present paper. The real strength of
the DCC estimation process is the flexibility it provides in modelling the dynamics of the volatility
process. While no attempt has been made in this paper, it would be easy to allow for asymmetric
affects in volatility. In addition, the theory of DCC specification can be easy extended to include
exogenous factors in the correlation model or alternative parameterizations. In particular , it would
21

be of interest to investigate whether correlation between assets is caused by either the volatility or
correlations of other assets.

Appendix

Proof of Proposition 1:

0

Assume A is positive definite. Further, B = A∗−1 AA∗−1 where A∗ is as defined in section 2. Since
A is real, symmetric and positive definite, we know there exists a cholesky factorization A = P 0 P
where P is upper triangular. Rewriting
0

B = A∗−1 P 0 P A∗−1 = (P A∗−1 )0 (P A∗−1 )
Finally, we know that (P A∗ −1 ) has full rank as it is the product of a diagonal matrix and a
triangular matrix,both with non-zero diagonal elements, and will necessarily be a triangular matrix
with nonzero diagonal elements. Using a familiar result form Linear Algebra, that X 0 X is positive
definite if and only if the X has full rank, thus B is positive definite. The proof assuming B is real,
symmetric and positive definite follows directly replacing A with B and A∗−1 with A∗ .
