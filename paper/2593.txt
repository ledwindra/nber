Economic Efficiency in Recent Tax Reform
History:
Policy Reversals or Consistent Improvements?

ABSTRACT

The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 reduced personal
marginal tax rates and provided significant

business tax breaks.

Subsequent changes through 1985 cut back on business allowances.

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced marginal rates again, but added
significantly

to business taxes.

Was there any unifying theme to

these tax changes, or do they represent frequent changes in course
for tax policy?

This paper uses a general equilibrium model capable of second—
best analysis to investigate the net effects on efficiency of each
of these changes in capital income taxation.

there is no set of other parameters in the model for which these

I. Introduction

Few areas of public policy have seen changes as frequent or as
dramatic as those in tax policy, with major legislation in almost
every year from 1980 to 1986.

These tax revisions may reflect an

evolving economic environment, changing views of individual leaders,
or simply shifts in political coalitions.

They may appear almost

random, however, at least with respect to any one of the multiple

and sometimes conflicting objectives of tax policy.

We might ask

whether these tax changes reflect any consistency with respect to
revenue, economic efficiency,

distributional effects, or any of a

number of noneconomic objectives of tax policy.
Tax initiatives enacted during the Reagan Administration might
seen particularly

inconsistent with respect to the economic

efficiency of taxes on income

front capital.

The Economic Recovery

Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA) reduced personal tax rates and depreciation
recovery periods, but it favored some assets more than others.

Subsequent changes through 1985 retrenched somewhat on the
of
generosity of depreciation allowances. Then the Tax Reform Act
1986 (TRA) repealed the investment tax credit, lengthened

lifetimes, and added almost $30 billion per year of

revenue to the corporate income tax.

measures of distortions in households' choices between labor and
leisure or between present and future consumption. In the latter

case, rhetoric about the level playing field was reinforced by
economists' measures of distortions in firms' choices among
investments. Moreover, all such measures of economic efficiency are
enhanced by lower marginal tax rates.

Birnbeuo and Murray (1987)

also note that "Reagan wanted to go down in history as the president

who cut the top tex rate at least in half, from 70 percent to 35
percent or lower,

If abandoning business tax breaks and raising

corporate taxes was the price he had to pay to achieve that goal, so
be it" (p. 286)

Were these tax changes essentially randon, or is there some set
of prior beliefs about parameter values under which efficiency
consistently

increases?

To address this question, we measure the

economic efficiency of capital tax provisions in this series of tax
initiatives

sectors, and among industries.

We also point out the importance of

key unknown parameters such as the elasticity of substitution among
assets and the elasticity of savings with respect to the net rate of
return.

The generality of the model is important.

For example,

Fullerton and Henderson (1985) evaluate the 1981 Act using a more
restricted model that concentrates on intertemporal distortions.

In

that model, firms use fixed combinations of assets, and ERTA always
generates welfare gains.

Here, we use a more general model

developed by Fullerton and Henderson (forthcoming) in which asset
choices are endogenous.

In this model, even with moderate

substitution parameters,

the less uniform taxation in ERTA can

generate welfare losses.

For another example, Auerbach (1983) and

Gravelle (1981) concentrate on asset distortions but assume
Cobb—Douglas

production functions.

Our more general functional

forms allow us to show how the ranking of tax reforms can be

reversed for non—unitary elasticities of substitution.
Using results of this model, we interpret recent tax reform
history.

We have no formal model of political decisionmaking,

but

it is interesting to see how beliefs about the relative importance
of different efficiency effects might have supported policymakers'
views about the ranking of alternative

reforms.

ERTA may have been

supported by those who believed that capital formation is important
(or,

in this model, that the saving elasticity is high), but it

increases economic efficiency only when the level playing field is
unimportant

(in this model, when the elasticity of substitution

among assets is low).

The aspects of the 1986 Act that reversed

ERTA may have been influenced by changing beliefs about the relative
size of those parameters or importance of those effects.

Results also depend on the assumed effect of dividend taxes.
Under the "new view" that dividend taxes have little effect on

investment incentives, there is no set of substitution and saving
elasticities

for which these tax initiatives led to consistent

improvements

in economic efficiency.

Under the "old view", however,

reduction of personal taxes on dividends does affect incentives.

The consumption side of the model is taken from Fullerton,
Shoveri

and Whalley

(FSW,

1983), where households have initial

endowments of labor and capital and maximize utility by choosing
among present consumption goods, leisure, and saving.

The

elasticity of substitution between consumption and leisure is

supply elasticity (0.15 for these calculations).

Similarly, the

elasticity of substitution between present and future consumption
specified to be consistent with an uncompensated

is

saving elasticity.

This parameter is set to Boskin's (1978) estimate of 0.4 for most
calculations,

but it is varied between 0.0 and 0.8 for others.1

In deciding how much to save, households myopically use current

prices as expected future prices.

We then calculate a sequence of

equilibria in which endogenous saving from one period augments the
capital stock in the next period.

Labor force growth is set

exogenously to place the 1980 baseline equilibrium on a steady state
path.

Domestic saving is the only source of investment funds, since

the model is not open to international capital flows.

In a final CES nest, for each sector of each industry, firms

III. The Effects of Tax Reforms
In 1980, when President Reagan was elected, the top statutory

corporate tax rate was 46 percent, end personal rates extended up to
70 percent.9 Most equipment received a 10 percent investment tax
credit, and capital cost recovery periods were based on the Asset

(ADR)

system.

Besides lowering all personal

rates, including the top rate from 70 to 50 percent, the Economic

Recovery Tax Act of 1981 expanded the investment tax credit and
created the Accelerated

Cost Recovery System (ACRS) which shortened

all depreciation lifetimes.

Table 1 shows that the fully phased—in

version of this bill would have lowered the cost of capital in the
corporate sector from 7.0 to 5.9 percent under the new view (8.5 to
7.0 percent under the old view).

ERTA also reduces the overall cost

of capital, which includes the noncorporate

old view is supported in Poterba and Summers (1983, 1985). Poterba
and Summers (1985) explain some conceptual problems with each view.

9For each tax law, the Treasury's individual tax file with 90,000
households was used to calculate the weighted—average personal
marginal rate on interest receipts, dividends, capital gains,
noncorporate business income, and mortgage interest deductions.
These rates were then modified to account for taxes at the state
level, the taxation of banks, insurance companies, and the holdings
of tax-exempt institutions.

Under the new view, where dividend tax reductions are
relatively unimportant,

tax changes may seem random.

In fact,

randomness may cause additional welfare costs (skinner, 1986, Alm,
1988) or benefits (Stiglitz, 1982, Chang and Wildasin,

1986).

The

apparently random changes may arise from shifting political
coalitions, despite well ordered individual preferences.

Even under the new view, however, each change may have been a
rational response to available information and oomsensus

views.4

Debate in 1980—81 was heavily influenced by the supply-side

school

of thought, and the ooosensus view may have held that the saving

elasticity was very high.

In addition, policymakers may have been

uninformed or unconcerned about interasset distortions.

Certainly

more of the discussion was about capital formation than about level
playing fields.

Thus ERTA may have been viewed as the highest

ranking reform on efficiency grounds.15

Then changes in tax law

through 1985 might be explained by changes in the actual or
perceived importance of these distortions.

Discussion of intarasset

distortions did not begin until Auerbach and Jorgenson (1980),

in fact, debate at the time included consideration of the AuerbachJorgenson (1980) first-year recovery system, a proposal to provide
economic depreciation at replacement cost. Although a major point
of that proposal was tc remove the effects of inflation, its
results in this model vould look very similar to those of the 1986
legislation because we do not consider varying inflation.

however, to follow tOe logic of the interpretations

view

that

t the model,
'iith the

new

taxes on dividends are relatlvely unicportant, recent tax

reforms appear inconsistent.

Advocates of the tconomic Recovery Tax

Act of 1981 cay have knowingly exacerbated

interasset distortions

in.

order to reduce intertemporal distortions, and subsequent
legislation may have been a rational response to new

a new

information or

consensus about the relative importance of those

distortions,

Alternatively,

with the old view that dividend taxes

matter, these reforms nay have been part of a coherent plan to

acheive greater economic efficiency through incremental tax reform.
