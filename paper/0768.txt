Schooling and Health: The Cigarette Connection

ABSTRACT

Numerous studies

by economists during the past decade have revealed

a large, statistically significant correlation between health and years of
schooling after controlling for differences in income and other variables.

Cigarette smoking is a likely intervening variable because of the strong
effect of smoking on morbidity and mortality, and because there is a strong
negative correlation between smoking and years of schooling——at least at

high school levels and above. This paper tests the hypothesis that schooling
causes differences in smoking behavior. We use retrospective smoking
histories of 1,183 white, non—Hispanic men and women who had completed 12

to 18 years of schooling. The data were collected in 1979 by the Stanford
University Heart Disease Prevention Program from randomly selected households in four small California cities.

The most striking result is that the negative relation between
schooling and smoking observed at age 24 is accounted for by differences
in smoking behavior present at age 17, when all subjects were still in

approximately the same grade. We conclude that additional years of schooling
cannot be the cause of differential smoking behavior; one or more "third
variables" must cause changes in both smoking and schooling.

Analysis of
smoking by cohort reveals that the schooling—smoking correlation developed
only after the health consequences of smoking became widely known; it has

remained strong even in the most recent cohorts. This implies that the
mechanism behind the schooling—smoking correlation may also give rise to
the schooling—health correlation.

SCHOOLING AND HEALTH:

THE CIGARETTE CONNECTION

Phillip Farrell and Victor R. Fuchs

One of the strongest generalizations to emerge from empirical

research on health in the United States is a positive correlation between

years of schooling and health status. At one time this relationship was
viewed as a "class" or "socioeconomic status" effect and was thought to
be significantly influenced by a positive relation between schooling and
income and a positive effect of income on health (A. Antonovsky, 1967).
Numerous studies by economists during the past decade, however, have
revealed a large, statistically significant relationship between health

and years of schooling after controlling for differences in income.-'
In a detailed exploration of the subject Michael Grossman (1975)
showed that this relationship was strong even among a population of middle—
aged white men, all of whom had at least completed high school. He also
showed that the relationship persisted after controlling for a large number

of family background variables, I.Q., and health status in high school.
Grossman has hypothesized that the additional years of schooling make an

individual a more efficient producer of health. This greater efficiency
may express itself through more judicious use of medical care or through
more knowledgeable choices about diet, exercise, cigarette smoking, and
other health—affecting activities.

Systematic differences in "life style" by years of schooling are
readily discernible (controlling for income), but such differences are
consistent with schooling—induced shifts in preferences as well as with

the augmented efficiency hypothesis. One attempt to test for schooling

2

effects in the use of, and outcomes from, in—hospital surgical operations
had essentially negative results (Louis Garrison, 1981). Years of schooling
was not systematically related to the stage of the disease at the time of
surgery, qualifications of the surgeon, length of hospital stay, or even
outcome of the surgery (controlling for the initially better general health
of those with more schooling).

Cigarette smoking has been regarded as a likely intervening variable

between schooling and health for two reasons. First, the relationship
between cigarette smoking and health is very strong. Among males with life
insurance the gross difference in life expectancy at age 35 between nonsmokers and those who smoke a pack a day is approximately six years (Jeffrey

Harris, 1981). Even within a relatively homogeneous population such as
regular participants in the Kaiser—Permanente Multiphasic Health checkups,
the age—sex—race—adjusted death rate for cigarette smokers is double that

of nonsmokers (G. ID. Friedman etal., 1981). Second, there is a strong
negative relationship between cigarette smoking and years of schooling, at

least at high school levels or above. In a 1975 national probability survey
the proportion of high school graduates who smoked was more than 50% higher
than that of college graduates (DHEW, 1976).

The reasons for the schooling—smoking relationship are not well

understood. One class of explanations asserts that schooling has a direct
effect on smoking behavior. Additional schooling may increase knowledge
about the harmful effects of smoking, it may change preferences, or it may
increase the individual's ability to develop strategies of self—control

(Richard Thaler and H. N. Shefrin, 1981). A second class of explanations
denies any causal role for years of schooling and asserts that the correlation

3

is attributable to one or more "third variables" that affect both schooling
and smoking behavior.

The purpose of this paper is to test alternative explanations
of the schooling—smoking relation.

Such tests may contribute to a

better understanding of smoking behavior and of the larger question of
the correlation between schooling and health. Our research strategy is
to examine the smoking behavior of different cohorts of men and women

before and after they have completed

their formal schooling. Pre— and

Post—schooling observations can shed light on whether additional years of

schooling changes behavior. Analyses of starting behavior by cohorts and
quitting behavior in different time periods can reveal how the schooling—
smoking relation was affected by the spread of information about the
adverse effects of cigarettes on health.

Data and Methods

The sample. The data used in this paper are drawn from 2,504
personal interviews conducted in the fall of 1979 by the Stanford Heart

Disease Prevention Program (SEPP) among residents aged 12 to 75 years in
randomly selected households in four small California cities: Modesto,

Monterey, Salinas, and San Luis Obispo. All cities are located in predominantly agricultural areas; their populations range between 30,000 and 130,000

(in 1975). The interviews were taken as part of a health education experiment
designed to test the effectiveness of techniques for altering smoking,
exercise, and dietary behaviors in order to reduce risk of heart disease
(Nathan Maccoby and Douglas Solomon, 1981).
Table 1 shows that the relations between schooling and health and

schooling and smoking status in this sample are similar to those reported

in national surveys. Health status as measured by days ot normal activity
limited by illness improves systematically with schooling.

Other health

indicators (not shown) such as health care utilization or personal satisfaction
with health also show systematic improvement with increased schooling. The
proportion smoking cigarettes on a daily basis declines with years of

schooling (except for increases at the very lowest levels of schooling, not

separately shown). Men are more likely to smoke than women, and the proportion
smoking is higher at age 24 than at age 17.

For the regression analyses that follow a subset of 1,183 survey
respondents was selected consisting of white, non—Hispanic men and women

whowerenot students at the time of the survey, had completed 12 to 18
years of schooling, and who were at least 24 years old; 45% were men and

55% women. Nonwhites and Hispanics (about 17% of the survey respondents)

were excluded because the sample size was inadequate to explore interactions
among ethnicity, schooling, and smoking.

Persons still in school or under

age 24 were excluded in order to focus on those who have had ample opportunity
to reveal their decisions about schooling and initiation of smoking. Over
90% of the ever regular smokers in the SHDPP survey began smoking by age 24.
Using a higher cut—off age (to capture a higher percentage of all possible
smokers) would remove from the study too many of the younger cohorts who
have been most exposed to information about the health consequences of
smoking.

To test the hypothesis of a causal relationship between schooling
and smoking, we need to observe a sample of individuals both before and

after they had completed differing amounts of schooling. Assuming
uninterrupted attendance in school from age 6 onward, those with more than
18 years of schooling were excluded so that everyone in our sample (including
those just age 24 in 1979) could be observed after the completion of

schooling. Persons with less than 12 years of schooling were excluded so
that the entire sample would still be in school at age 17, when nearly half
of the ever regular smokers in this sample had begun smoking.

To include
-

of
persons with fewer years of schooling and still achieve the objective
observing the entire sample at a common age when all were still in school,
a younger age would have to be selected when there was not yet much smoking
activity.

With this sample we can study the effects of additional years of
schooling (beyond 12) on smoking behavior; we cannot explicitly investigate
the effects of differences in the quality or type of schooling, although

the effects should be similar since differences in quality of schooling
are a particular dimension of quantity of education, ceteris paribus. We

7

will look at the relation between schooling

(ultimately completed) and the

probability of smoking at ages 17 and 24; we will also examine the relation
between schooling and the probability of continuing to smoke, conditional
on having been a regular smoker.

The variables. Respondents to the SHDPP 1979 survey were asked if
they had ever smoked cigarettes on a daily basis. Those who responded

affirmatively are classified as "ever regular smokers." Ever regular smokers
were also asked at what age they began smoking and whether they had smoked

in the past week. Those who had smoked in the past week are considered
current regular smokers; those who had not are considered former regular

smokers. Former regular smokers were asked how long ago they quit. The
answers to these questions were used to construct retrospective histories

of smoking status.V

characteristics such as cultural traditions (including

Family background
religion), income,

and whether the parents smoked are possibly important influences on whether

a person begins to smoke. Unfortunately, the only such background characteristic included in the 1979 SHDPP survey was father's years of completed

schooling. Approximately 17% of the white survey respondents did not give
father's schooling; the median years of completed father's schooling for
their ten—year age cohort was assigned.--"

Although generally not statis-

tically significant in either continuous or categorical forms, father's
schooling was retained in the final regression.

The absence of other

background variables may be less of a problem in this relatively homogeneous
sample than in a national sample.

8

Cohorts were defined according to historical periods of possibly

different smoking behavior. The critical years were believed to be entry
into World War 2 (1942), the first appearance in the popular press of
articles linking smoking to lung cancer! (c. 1953), and the publication of
the first Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health (DREW, 1964). Survey
respondents were assigned to the cohort that included the calendar year when

they were 17 years of age. The four cohorts defined by these three important
years were roughly equal in size in these data; further sub—divisions of
each cohort were used in some analyses.

Possible bias in variables. Potential systematic bias in the
measurement of smoking status is an important concern, especially if bias

is correlated with education. The most obvious potential source of bias
when using survey results is the possibility that respondents lie about
their smoking status or history in order to avoid perceived social stigma

or disapproval. Fortunately, tests for the presence of smoking by—products
carbon monoxide in expired air and thiocyanate in blood samples collected
by the SHDPP as part of their survey establish the veracity of self—reported
current smoking behavior, and by extension, previous smoking behavior (since

the motivation to lie——social stigma——would be less strong for previous
smoking than current smoking.

All of the female self—reported nonsmokers (including former smokers)
and 97.5% of the male ones had levels of smoking by—products well below
"threshold levels" used to classify typical smokers (8 ppm CO and 100 micro—

moles/liter thiocyanate; see Vogt etal., 1977). Furthermore, for self—
reported nonsmokers mean levels of these by—products (and thus the probability
of lying) decreased with increased years of schooling, though only the
differences in CO levels were statistically significant.' If present at all,

9

systematic bias due to "lying" is thus very minor and works in the direction
of reducing, not increasing, the observed strength of the schooling—smoking
relationship.

Another potential source of bias is differential survivorship of

smokers and nonsmokers. The direction and size of bias depends upon the
absolute difference in mortality, the true proportion who were smokers at

different levels of schooling, and possible effects on death rates of

interactions between smoking and education.

We have attempted

to estimate the potential bias assuming mortality rates for smokers that
were double those of nonsmokers, and concluded that even for our oldest
cohort the effect is small unless the interaction between smoking and

education was very large.-" Most important of all, considering the purposes
of this paper, the effect on the comparison between the schooling—smoking

Because of the dichotomous nature of the smoking state

variables, the binary logistic model was used to estimate regressions of

smoking on schooling. In this model the probability of smoking, F, is
assumed to be related to the independent variables by

indicating the appropriateness of the functional form.

Results

Table 2 reports the results of maximum likelihood logit regressions
in which the probability of smoking is a function of years of own schooling,
years of father's schooling, cohort

and interactions between cohort and own

schooling. Identical regressions were estimated for the probability of
smoking at age 17 and age 24 with schooling measured in both cases as the
number of years the individual would eventually complete (by 1979). This
specification permits a test of whether the schooling—smoking relationship
observed in this sample was established before or after the additional years

of schooling were obtained. The schooling by cohort interactions allow a
test of whether the effect was associated with the news of adverse health
effects from smoking.

The most striking result is that the negative relation between
schooling and smoking is generally as strong at age 17 as at age 24 for all
cohorts; for women, the relationship is stronger at age 17 than at age 24

for the two most recent cohorts. At age 17, however, the individuals were all
still in the same school grade (approximately). Thus the relative differences
in the probability of smoking that are observed at age 24 between persons
with differing years of schooling are already present at age 17, before the

schooling is obtained. The additional schooling cannot be the cause of the
differential smoking behavior.

The second important result is that the differences in smoking by
years of schooling appear to be motivated, at least in part, by health

concerns. This can be seen in the variation in the schooling coefficients
by cohort, which shows how the schooling—smoking relation has changed over

time. This variation is important because before 1953 there was little

11

public discussion linking cigarettes to bad health, and before 1964 there
was little explicit public anti—smoking policy.
The regression results in Table 2 show that schooling has a sharply

different relation to smoking in the periods before and after health

consequences of smoking became a major public concern. The total schooling
coefficients1' for the two pre—l953.cohorts are small for all age/sex
combinations, and none are significantly different from zero (p > .10
for all)

or from each other. For women, the 1953—1964 cohort

coefficients appear to

still show a statistically insignificant relation between schooling and
smoking (although, see the results below using finer cohort

classifications).

Beginning with the 1953—64 cohort for men, and continuing through the 1964—72
cohort for both men and women, the total schooling coefficients at both ages
became strongly and sharply negative; they are statistically different from
the pre—1953 coefficients at p < .05 and different from zero at p <
.01
(based on the standard errors of the total coefficients, not shown in the
table).

The coefficients for father's schooling in Table 2 are small and

statistically insignificant. Even if own schooling is left out of the
regression or interactions between father's schooling and cohort are added,
the father's schooling coefficient remains weak.

Father's schooling may

perform poorly in these regressions because of correlation with several
potentially conflicting influences on smoking, such as social class and

family income. For instance, father's schooling might be positively correlated
with smoking among women in older cohorts because social disapproval of
smoking by women was stronger for the "lower class" (Jeffrey

Harris, 1980).

Father's schooling could be correlated with decreased probability of smoking,

at least during the era of health concerns about smoking, through a negative
relation between father's ow-n smoking and schooling coupled with a positive

influence of parental smoking on teenage smoking. Finally, father's schooling
is undoubtedly positively correlated with family income. If income elasticity
of demand for cigarettes has declined over time, father's schooling may have
positively influenced smoking through an income effect among older cohorts
but not among younger cohorts.

The intercept and simple cohort coefficients in Table 2 show the
partial effect of cohort, holding the effect of interactions between schooling

and cohort at zero. To obtain the partial difference between two cohorts
holding schooling constant at some non—zero level, one must sum the difference
between the simple cohort dummy coefficients and the difference between the
schooling by cohort interaction coefficients (evaluated at the specified

level of schooling). Evaluating the inter—cohort effects with schooling
held constant at the mean value (rather than zero) produces a set of cohort
difference coefficients that are considerably reduced in magnitude and
different in pattern from the simple cohort dummy variable coefficients
shown in Table 2.
At mean schooling levels, the partial effect of cohort for men is
increased smoking in successively younger cohorts up to the 1953—63 cohort
for both ages (except for a dip at age 24 in the 1942—52 cohort), followed

by a sharp decline in smoking in the 1964—72 cohort. For women, smoking
increases in successive cohorts right through the 1964—72 cohort at age 17;
at age 24, smoking increases through the 1953—63 cohort and then drops sharply

in the 1964—72 cohort. None of these cohort—to—cohort changes are statistically significant (at p <

.05),

however, except the decrease in smoking

among 24—year—old men in the 1964—72 cohort.

14

Another way to view the difference in the schooling—smoking relation
by cohort, age, and sex is to examine the predicted probabilities of smoking

implied by the regression results. Table 3 shows those predictions for the
end values and midpoint of years of schooling, for each cohort/age/sex

combination. These predicted probabilities clearly show the dramatic change
in the schooling—smoking relation between the pre— and post-"health concern'T

cohorts. The strong negative relation between schooling and smoking came
about primarily from decreases in smoking by the highly educated; smoking
probabilities for those with only 12 years of schooling are generally as high or higher

in the post—"health concern" cohorts as in the pre—"health concern" cohorts.

Table 3 also reaffirms that the schooling—smoking relationship observed at
age 24, after schooling was completed, could be accounted for by equally
strong differences in smoking probabilities among the same individuals at
age 17, before they had obtained differential amounts of schooling.
In order to obtain a more detailed view of the timing of changes

in the schooling—smoking relation the four cohorts in the regression of
Table 2 were further divided into nine cohorts of approximately equal size

within each sex. Maximum likelihood logit regressions were estimated for
each cohort within each sex separately for the probability of smoking at
ages 17 and 24 versus own schooling and intercept (father's schooling was
omitted because of its insignificant coefficient in previous regressions)
The schooling coefficients are plotted on an inverted scale versus the cohort

mean year. (See Figure 1.)
The schooling coefficients are estimated less precisely because of
smaller sample sizes (standard errors range from .10 to .26, with a mean

of .16). Nevertheless, Figure 1 confirms Table 2 and shows even more clearly

the dramatic change in the schooling—smoking relation that occurred after

knowledge of adverse health effects of smoking became widespread. For men
the strong schooling—smoking relation begins with the 1953—59 cohort; for

women it begins with the 1960—63 cohort. The more detailed cohort analysis
also confirms the finding that the schooling—smoking relation is as strong
at age 17 as at age 24.

Additional support for the conclusion that the schooling—smoking
relation only developed after the health effects of smoking became widely
publicized comes from regressions of quitting behavior (see Table 4).

It is

only in the 1964—79 period that the probability of smoking at the end of the
period (conditional on having smoked sometimg during the period) was significantly related to years of schooling (for men).

Discussion
The data examined in this paper reject the hypothesis that additional
years of schooling play a significant causal role in the schooling—smoking

corre1ation.' There are apparently one or more "third variables" that
affect both smoking and years of schooling. These data do, however, support
the hypothesis that the schooling—smoking relation, and by implication, the
effect of any underlying "third variable," is related to considerations of
health consequences of smoking.
What is the third variable that leads to differences in both schooling

and smoking? The data reject the view that differences in "social class"
are the underlying cause. First, the effect of father's schooling is very
weak and not statistically significant even in regressions which omit the

individual's own schooling. Second, "class" effects should presumably have

been present for the older cohorts as well as the more recent ones, but no
significant relation between schooling and smoking emerges until after 1953
for men and after 1960 for women.

Mental ability is another possible third variable. Those individuals
who complete additional schooling are presumably more intelligent. Differences in smoking incidence among high school students have also been correlated
with differences in academic performance, which itself is a correlate of

ability (Barry Borland and Joseph Rudolph, 1975). Thus, even though all
our sample have the same number of years of schooling at age 17, those of
greater mental ability may more rapidly absorb and act upon information about
the harmful effects of smoking, as well as obtain more additional schooling.
If the schooling—smoking correlation was primarily due to superior mental
ability, however, one might expect that it would become weaker over time as
knowledge about the harmful effects of smoking became more widely diffused.
The analysis by cohort provides no evidence of such weakening over time.
Fuchs (forthcoming, 1982) suggests that both schooling and smoking
behavior are related to individual differences in time discount, i.e.,
willingness and ability to incur current costs for future benefits. Schooling
has long been recognized as a form of investment; decisions about cigarette

smoking have a similar character. Assuming imperfect capital markets,
differences in time discount could explain the observed correlation between

schooling and smoking. The data in this study are consistent with this
hypothesis, but cannot test it.

Cigarette smoking is undoubtedly an important intervening variable

in the correlation between schooling and health. If, as this study suggests,
additional years of schooling is not causally related to smoking, identification of the "third variable" that affects both may provide a key to understanding the schooling—health relationship.

2. Spells of nonsmoking by current regular smokers were ignored,
since their duration and timing were not recorded in the survey. For our
purposes the error thus introduced in determination of smoking status at 17
or 24 is probably not significant.

3. Regressions were also tried excluding those missing fatherts
years of completed schooling. Results were the same as the full sample
with median values assigned to missing observations.

6. The ratio of the probability of smoking for 12th versus 18th
graders changed by about 10% after removing effects of survivorship bias,

assuming no interactions. Details of the calculation available upon request.
7. The total schooling coefficient for any cohort is obtained by
adding the cohort interaction effect in Table 2 to the base schooling
coefficient; differences in the effect of schooling between cohorts are
simply the differences in the cohort interaction coefficients (or the
interaction coefficients themselves for differences from the omitted 1921—41
cohort).

8. This paper does not explicitly address the possibility that
differences in quality of schooling prior to the 12th grade could be the

cause of the observed differences in smoking behavior at age 17. Differences
in quality, however, are similar to additional years of schooling because
both reflect differences in the quantity of education inputs into the

individual. We find no causal relationship between education inputs after
the 12th grade (in the form of additional years of schooling) and smoking.
To assert a strong causal role for education inputs up to the 12th grade
(in the form of "quality" differences) would then require that causality

suddenly cease after the 12th grade. It stretches plausibility to suppose
that schooling can increase knowledge, change preferences, increase ability
for self—control, or otherwise exert strong influence over smoking behavior
until the 12th grade and not at all thereafter.
