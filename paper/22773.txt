Multidimensional Private Information, Market Structure and Insurance Markets
Hanming Fang and Zenan Wu
NBER Working Paper No. 22773
October 2016
JEL No. D82,G22,H11
ABSTRACT
A large empirical literature found that the correlation between insurance purchase and ex post
realization of risk is often statistically insignificant or negative. This is inconsistent with the
predictions from the classic models of insurance a la Akerlof (1970), Pauly (1974) and Rothschild
and Stiglitz (1976) where consumers have one-dimensional heterogeneity in their risk types. It is
suggested that selection based on multidimensional private information, e.g., risk and risk
preference types, may be able to explain the empirical findings. In this paper, we systematically
investigate whether selection based on multidimensional private information in risk and risk
preferences, can, under different market structures, result in a negative correlation in equilibrium
between insurance coverage and ex post realization of risk. We show that if the insurance market
is perfectly competitive, selection based on multidimensional private information does not result
in negative correlation property in equilibrium, unless there is a sufficiently high loading factor.
If the insurance market is monopolistic or imperfectly competitive, however, we show that it is
possible to generate negative correlation property in equilibrium when risk and risk preference
types are sufficiently negative dependent, a notion we formalize using the concept of copula. We
also clarify the connections between some of the important concepts such as adverse/
advantageous selection and positive/negative correlation property.

Introduction

The classic asymmetric information models of insurance pioneered by Arrow (1963), Pauly
(1974), Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976) and Wilson (1977) assume that potential insurance buyers
have one-dimensional private information regarding their risk type. These models predict a positive
correlation between insurance coverage and ex post realizations of losses. The reason is ex ante
adverse selection, namely, that the “bad risks” (i.e., those relatively likely to su↵er a loss) have
a higher willingness to pay for insurance; and allowing for ex post moral hazard only strengthens
the positive correlation between coverage and ex post losses. This “positive correlation property”
of the classic asymmetric information models forms the basis for empirical tests of asymmetric
information in several recent papers (see Chiappori and Salanié 2000).
However, the results from a growing empirical literature testing for the correlation between
insurance coverage and ex post realization of risks are mixed and vary by market. In an auto
insurance market, Chiappori and Salanié (2000) find that accident rates for young French drivers
who choose comprehensive automobile insurance is not statistically di↵erent from those opting for
the legal minimum coverage, after controlling for observable characteristics known to automobile
insurers. In contrast, Cohen (2005), using data from an online Israeli insurer, finds that new
auto insurance customers choosing a low deductible tend to have more accidents, leading to higher
total losses for the insurer.1 In a life insurance market, Cawley and Philipson (1999) find that
the mortality rate of U.S. males who purchase life insurance is below that of the uninsured, even
when controlling for many factors such as income that may be correlated with life expectancy.2
For long term care (LTC) insurance market, Finkelstein and McGarry (2006), using panel data
from a sample of Americans born before 1923 (the AHEAD study), find no statistically significant
correlation between LTC coverage in 1995 and use of nursing home care between 1995-2000, even
after controlling for insurers’ assessment of a person’s risk type; moreover, when they use whether
respondents undertake various types of preventive health care as a proxy for risk aversion, they find
that people who are more risk averse by this measure are both more likely to own LTC insurance
and less likely to enter a nursing home. In an annuity insurance market, Finkelstein and Poterba
(2004) find systematic relationships between ex post mortality and annuity characteristics, such as
the timing of payments and the possibility of payments to the annuitants’ estate, but they do not
find evidence of substantive mortality di↵erences by annuity size. For Medigap insurance market,
Fang, Keane and Silverman (2008) find that, conditional on controls for Medigap prices, those
with Medigap spend on average $4,000 less on medical care than those without, providing a strong
evidence for negative correlation between Medigap purchase and ex post realization of risk.
These empirical findings fueled an emerging literature on the possibility that multidimensional
1

Others have examined the evidence of asymmetric information in the choice of insurance contracts such as
deductibles and co-payments etc. For example, Puelz and Snow (1994) study automobile collision insurance and
argue that, in an adverse selection equilibrium, individuals with lower risk will choose a contract with a higher
deductible, and contracts with higher deductibles should be associated with lower average prices for coverage. They
find evidence in support of each of these predictions using data from an automobile insurer in Georgia. However, see
Chiappori and Salanié (2000) and Dionne et al. (2001) for critiques of the Puelz and Snow study.

private information may lead to what has been called “advantageous selection.”3 The formal theoretical literature is sparse. de Meza and Webb (2001) postulate a model in which individuals
di↵er in their risk preferences, which they refer to as “timid” and “bold” types. They assume that
more timid types may lower their risk exposure through increased insurance purchase and greater
precautionary e↵ort to reduce risks. They show that, in the presence of administrative costs in
processing claims and issuing policies, there exists a pure-strategy, partial pooling, subgame-perfect
Nash equilibrium in the insurance market that exhibits the negative correlation property. Thus,
failure to condition on risk aversion may then mask the positive correlation between insurance coverage and ex post risk predicted by one-dimensional models. Following de Meza and Webb (2001),
the existing literature points to risk preferences as the primary suspect behind advantageous selection. In general, however, any private information could function as a source of advantageous
selection if it is positively correlated with insurance coverage and at the same time negatively
correlated with risk. Finkelstein and McGarry (2006) argue that their findings on LTC insurance
market is consistent with multidimensional private information and advantageous selection based
on risk aversion; in fact, their findings suggest that, on net, adverse selection based on risk and
advantageous selection based on risk aversion roughly cancel out in the LTC insurance market.
Fang, Keane and Silverman (2008) find that, for Medigap insurance market, risk preferences do not
appear as a source of advantageous selection, but cognitive ability is particularly important.
However, to the best of our knowledge, the precise conditions under which whether selection
based on multidimensional private information may generate in equilibrium a positive or negative
correlation between insurance purchase and ex post realization of risk is still unknown. Most of the
existing papers that invoked the possibility of multidimensional private information as a possible
explanation for the empirical findings discussed above rely on partial equilibrium intuition (much
in the spirit of Hemenway, 1990).4 The goal of this paper is to fill in this gap. We present a
simple model of insurance market where consumers have multidimensional private information in
risk and risk preference types, and systematically investigate whether selection based on multidimensional private information can, under di↵erent market structures, result in negative correlation
in equilibrium between insurance coverage and ex post realization of risk. We show that if the
insurance market is perfectly competitive, selection based on multidimensional private information
does not generate negative correlation property in equilibrium unless there is a sufficiently high
loading factor. If the insurance market is monopolistic, however, we show that it is possible to
generate negative correlation property in equilibrium when risk type and risk preference type are
sufficiently negative dependent, a notion we formalize using the concept of copula. We further show
that this result generalizes to imperfectly competitive market structure.
3

The first description of this phenomenon in the economics literature appears to be Hemenway (1990), who used
the term “propitious selection.”
4
An important paper by Chiappori, Jullien, Salanié and Salanié (2006, henceforth CJSS) argue that in a competitive insurance market the positive correlation property is a general implication of insurance models with asymmetric
information even when the private information is multidimensional in risk and risk preferences. The key assumptions
are consumer rationality and a condition which they refer to as “nonincreasing profit” condition - that is, the per
contract expected profit does not increase with the generosity of the contract. We will discuss the connection between
our results with their results in Section 4.

2

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we provide a detailed discussion of the related literature. In Section 3, we describe our model environment in which consumers
are heterogeneous in both risk and risk preference types. In Section 4, we consider the perfectly
competitive market structure and show that, unless the loading factor is sufficiently high, selection
based on multidimensional private information does not generate negative correlation property in
equilibrium, regardless of the dependence structure between the two dimensions of private information. In Section 5, we analyze the other polar case of monopolistic market structure where we show
that it is possible to generate negative correlation property in equilibrium when risk type and risk
preference type are sufficiently negative dependent, a notion we formalize using the concept of copula. In Section 6, we clarify the confusions in this growing literature about the connections between
some of the important concepts such as adverse/advantageous selection and positive/negative correlation property. In Section 7, we introduce a parameterization of the imperfect market structure
and show that our results for the monopoly case derived in Section 5 are robust. In Section 8,
we partially endogenize the contract space and again show that our results for the single contract
case derived in Sections 4 and 5 continue to hold with natural and mild additional assumptions. In
Section 9, we summarize our main findings and suggest directions for future research.

Related Literature

To the extent that our paper investigates on whether positive correlation property is robust
to environments with multidimensional consumer heterogeneity, it is most related to CJSS (2006)
and de Meza and Webb (2016). CJSS argue that, as long as consumers are rational and the per
contract expected profit does not increase with the generosity of the contract (which they refer
to as “nonincreasing profit” (NIP) condition), then the positive correlation property is robust to
multidimensional private information in a competitive insurance market. This conclusion is similar
to our results for the competitive insurance market presented in Propositions 1-2 and Proposition
8. Their results are proved using the revealed preference argument implied by the hypothesized
consumer rationality and the nonincreasing profit condition assumed on the supply side, and as
such they do not have to exploit the full set of equilibrium restrictions. In contrast, we exploit the
full set of the equilibrium restrictions and as a result our positive correlation predictions for the
competitive insurance market are sharper for the case of proportional loading factor case. We will
provide more details of the comparison when we discuss Proposition 2. Also related, de Meza and
Webb (2016) provide an insightful discussion that the positive correlation test is not a valid test to
distinguish asymmetric information from symmetric information environment. The reason is that
under symmetric information, the only insurance purchased by consumers will be full cover, unless
the claim processing costs (or loading factors) are formally modeled. The results in our paper is
more relevant in distinguishing multi- vs. one-dimensional private information models of insurance
as opposed to symmetric vs. asymmetric information models of insurance.
Our paper is related to a recent literature that attempts to analyze the selection markets with
potentially multidimensional private information. Einav, Finkelstein and Cullen (2010) propose an
3

approach to conduct empirical welfare analysis in insurance markets based on directly estimating
the demand and average (and marginal) cost curves using exogenous variations in prices.5 Based on
their graphical analysis of the demand and cost curves for the selection market, where the defining
feature is that insurers’ costs depend on which consumers purchase their products and hence are
endogenous to price, they also argue that slope of the estimated marginal cost curve provides a direct
test of the existence and nature of selection, i.e., whether the selection is adverse or advantageous.
Specifically, they argue that a rejection of the null hypothesis of a constant marginal cost curve is
a rejection of the null hypothesis of no selection, whereas the selection is adverse if marginal cost
is increasing in price or advantageous if marginal cost is decreasing in price. They also emphasize
that an attractive feature of their approach of relying only on the estimated demand and cost
curves is that “it does not require the researcher to make (often difficult-to-test) assumptions about
consumers’ preferences or the nature of ex ante information” (Einav, Finkelstein and Cullen, 2010,
p. 879). In Section 6, we show that an important limitation of their approach is that generically the
marginal cost curve is non-monotonic when consumer heterogeneity is multidimensional.6 In fact,
in our setting with two-dimensional private information in risk and risk aversion, it is monotonic
only when the two dimensions are perfectly correlated. Therefore, depending on the range of the
price variations available in the data that is used to estimate the demand and cost curves, it is
likely the estimated cost curve only reflects the nature of the selection –adverse or advantageous–
locally.7 We also provide an example (Example 4) in which the nature of the local selection being
advantageous at the equilibrium price level does not imply a negative correlation between insurance
purchase and ex post realization of risk in equilibrium.
We explicitly model consumers’ multidimensional heterogeneity in this paper. The intuition for
why marginal cost curve is unlikely to be monotonically increasing in market size in our model can
be easily explained. Consider an environment where consumers’ willingness to pay for insurance is
increasing in their risk type m and
h risk
i aversion type . Suppose that risk type and risk aversion
type are bounded in [m, m] and ,
respectively. Then the marginal cost of insurance when the
market size is close to 0 will be close to m and the marginal cost when the market size is close to 1 will
be close to m. That is, the marginal cost curve must always have at least one decreasing segment!
Another benefit of modeling consumers’ multidimensional heterogeneity explicitly is that it allows
us to examine how the market outcome changes when the dependence structure of individuals’
multidimensional heterogeneity varies. We use the concept of copula to parameterize the degree of
dependence between the consumers’ multidimensional types.
Mahoney and Weyl (2016) build and analyze a model of imperfect competition in selection
markets. They parameterize the degree of both market power and selection, and use graphical price5

Einav and Finkelstein (2011) are aware of the non-monotonicity issue of marginal cost curve, as they stated: “More
generally, once we allow for preference heterogeneity, the marginal cost curve needs not be monotone. However, for
simplicity and clarity we focus our discussion on the polar cases of monotone cost curves.” (footnote 7, p. 124).

Einav, Finkelstein and Cullen (2010) have a total of six price levels (or three price levels if one only considers
those with somewhat large number of consumers). Also, the range of the price variations is quite limited.

theoretic reasoning to analyze the interactions between selection and imperfect competition. Their
parameterization of selection follows Einav, Finkelstein and Cullen (2010) by hypothesizing whether
the marginal cost curve is upward or downward sloping, and as such it has the same limitation
that globally increasing marginal cost curves are in fact non-generic in models of multidimensional
heterogeneity.
Azevedo and Gottlieb (2016) propose an equilibrium concept for competitive insurance market
where consumers may have multidimensional heterogeneity, and insurance companies compete for
consumers by choosing contracts from a compact space and setting their corresponding prices.
Their equilibrium concept, which relies on perturbations, guarantees existence. Veiga and Weyl
(2016) instead study the incentives for a monopolistic insurer in its choice of insurance quality facing
consumers with multidimensional heterogeneity. They derive a condition of the optimal insurance
quality to emphasize that the sorting incentives of the monopolist is the ratio of two terms: the
numerator is the covariance among marginal consumers between the marginal willingness to pay
for quality and the cost for the firm, and the denominator is marginal consumer surplus, which
measures market power. The analysis of Veiga and Weyl (2016) focus on the marginal consumers,
and does not analyze correlation between insurance purchase and ex post realization of risk which
is about the average insurance buyers and non-buyers; and they also focus on monopolistic market
structure, while our paper highlights the interactions between multidimensional heterogeneity and
market structure.8 In the basic model of our paper, the quality of insurance is assumed to be
exogenously fixed, and we focus on the determination of premium; while Veiga and Weyl (2016)
focuses on how the monopolistic insurer determines the profit-maximizing quality of insurance.
Neither Azevedo and Gottlieb (2016) nor Veiga and Weyl (2016) analyze whether multidimensional
consumer heterogeneity can generate negative correlation between insurance purchase and ex post
realization of risk in equilibrium.9

The Model

Consumers. There is a continuum of consumers with heterogeneous types indexed by ✓ ⌘
(m, ), where m 2 [m, m] with 0  m < m < 1 denotes consumer’s risk type, and 2 [ , ]
with 0 < < < 1 can be interpreted as any other characteristics of the consumer that may be
related to his/her risk preference.10 As a notational convention, we use M and ⇤ respectively to
denote the random variables for risk type and risk preference type, and their lowercase counterparts
as their realizations. In the population, consumers’ type, (m, ) , is assumed to be independently
8

Also related to our paper, Weyl and Veiga (2014) o↵er a quantitative strengthening of the notion of affiliation
for multidimensional random vectors that is useful to relate dependence between risk type and risk preferences to the
direction of selection.
9
It should be noted that Azevedo and Gottlieb (2016) introduce a notion of intensive margin selection coefficient
that measures the di↵erence between the marginal changes of the premium and the cost of insuring the marginal
consumers, both with respect to the insurance coverage. They suggest that this notion is related to the positive
correlation test. We will discuss its connection with our results in Sections 6 and 8 below.

We assume that m and are bounded above by m and respectively for the simplicity in describing some of the
intuitions for our results. All of our results are robust to unbounded supports.

drawn from joint CDF H(m, ), and we denote the marginal CDF of M and ⇤ by F (m) and G ( )
respectively. We use h (m, ) , f (m) and g ( ) to denote the corresponding joint and marginal
density functions of (M, ⇤) , M and ⇤, respectively. We assume that the marginal distribution of
M is such that M has finite mean, denoted by E [M ] . We allow dependence between M and ⇤ in
this paper, and we will discuss the form of the dependence in details in Section 5.
Insurance Contract. Consumers decide whether or not to purchase insurance. In the basic
model, we assume that insurance firms are regulated in the sense that they can only provide
insurance with quality x 2 (0, 1] where a higher x indicating a contract with better coverage. Note
that we assume that the insurance coverage quality x is not a choice variable for the firms. As
such, our setup is in the spirit of Akerlof (1970) where insurance contract is exogenously given,
rather than Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976) where the insurance quality x is endogenously chosen.
The cost to the insurance firms, not inclusive of any loading cost, for providing quality-x insurance to a type-✓ ⌘ (m, ) consumer, denoted by C (✓; x) , is increasing in consumer’s risk type m
and the coverage quality x. Note that it does not depend on the consumer’s risk preference type .
In particular, we let C(✓; x) = x · c(m) where, without loss of generality, we assume that c0 (·) > 0.
Consumer Preference. Type-✓ ⌘ (m, ) consumer’s willingness to pay (WTP) for an insurance policy with quality x is denoted by v(✓; x). We make the following assumptions on v (·) :
Assumption 1 @v/@x > 0, @v/@m > 0 and @v/@ > 0.
Assumption 1 simply says that consumer’s WTP for insurance is increasing in her risk type, in
her risk preference type and the quality of the contract coverage.
Assumption 2 v(✓; x) > C(✓; x) ⌘ x · c(m), for all ✓.
Assumption 2 holds for many economic framework of insurance as long as individuals are riskaverse.11 The di↵erence between the WTP for insurance v(✓; x) and C(✓; x) is commonly referred
to as the risk premium for type-(m, ) consumer.
Facing a premium p for insurance coverage x, a type-(m, ) consumer purchases insurance if
and only if p  v((m, ) ; x). We use
B (p) ⌘ ✓ : v(✓; x)

p

(1)

to denote the set of consumers whose WTP for the insurance exceeds the premium and thus they
are the set of buyers; and use
N B (p) ⌘ ✓ : v(✓; x) < p
(2)
to denote the set of non-buyers at price p.
11
In environments with heterogeneity in ex post moral hazard, such as that studied in Einav et al. (2013), it is
possible that v (✓; x) does not always exceed C (✓; x), as shown in the Example 3 in Azevedo and Gottlieb (2016).
Moral hazard can also indirectly lead to a violation of Assumption 1 if consumers face budget constraints.

6

Remark 1 In practice, firm can charge premiums based on observable characteristics. In this paper
we simplify our analysis by assuming the observed characteristics are the same across all consumers.
It is useful to think of our analysis as being within the consumers of a particular risk classification
class. This simplification allows us to focus on the comparison between multidimensional private
information and one-dimensional private information.
Example 1 (Binary States) Each consumer has initial wealth y and is subject to a possible loss
! 2 (0, y) with probability m. The consumer can purchase an insurance contract to cover a fraction
x of the loss if it occurs. Let u (·; ) be consumer’s utility function where is the risk preference
parameter. Then the expected cost to the insurance firm for insuring type-(m, ) consumer is
C(m, ; x) = xc (m) = xm!. Consumers’ WTP for insurance of coverage x is determined by:
m·u y

v

(1

x)!;

+ (1

m) · u(y

v; ) = m · u(y

!; ) + (1

m) · u(y; ).

The concavity of u(·; ) implies that v(✓; x) > xm! = C (✓; x). By the implicit function theorem,
it can be verified that @v/@x > 0 and @v/@m > 0. Finally, fixing x = 1, @v/@ > 0 holds for both
Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) and Constant Absolute Risk Aversion (CARA) utility
functions when we interpret as relative risk aversion and absolute risk aversion respectively.12
Example 2 (CARA and Normal Shocks) Consumers have initial wealth y and may experience a medical expenditure Z ⇠ N (m, 2 ). A consumer has CARA utility u(y) = exp( y),
where is consumer’s constant absolute risk aversion. Type-(m, ) consumers’ WTP for insurance
of coverage x is determined by:

Note that Proposition 1 states that negative correlation property will not emerge in a competitive insurance market without loadings, regardless of the dependence structure between risk

insurance market, the equilibrium premium must be equal to the expected risk realization of the
insured, which is lower than that of the uninsured under negative correlation property. But if
the equilibrium premium were indeed lower than the expected risk realization of the uninsured,
it must also be lower than their average WTP under Assumption 2. This in turn implies that
at the equilibrium premium, some of the uninsured must prefer to purchase insurance as well, a
contradiction.
Now we consider the role of loadings. Denote the loading factor by ` > 0, and by p⇤ (`) the
competitive equilibrium price in a market with loading factor `, which is determined by:
h
i
p⇤ (`) = (1 + `) xE c(M )|B p⇤ (`) .

(10)

We have the following result:17

Proposition 2 (Positive Correlation Property Holds in Competitive Equilibrium with
Low Loadings) Suppose Assumption 1 and 2 are satisfied. A sufficient condition for the positive
correlation property to hold in equilibrium if the insurance market is perfectly competitive is

where the second inequality follows from the postulated restriction (11) on the loading factor `.
Note that the upper bound on the loading factor specified by (11) depends on the ratio of the
WTP for the consumer with average risk and lower-bound risk preference relative to its expected
claim. Proposition 2 shows that if the loading factor is bounded by (11), then competitive insurance
market will always exhibit positive correlation property in equilibrium even in the presence of
loading factors. The intuition is again quite simple. In order for the equilibrium that low risk types

purchase insurance while the high types do not to exist, it must be the case that the premium is
higher than the WTP for the high risk type. But the only way for the such levels of premium when
the insured is actually of low risk type is that the loading factor must be very high, which is ruled
out by the upper bound (11) on the loading factor.
Remark 2 We could have redefined consumers’ “risk type” to be inclusive of the insurance loading. Such a redefinition of risk type will make Assumption 2 a more stringent assumption on all
consumers’ risk premium. The sufficient condition (11) stated in Proposition 2 requires that the
risk premium for the average risk type is sufficiently high.
The following (extremely simple) example illustrates why the stated upper bound on loading
factors is sufficient to rule out negative correlation property in equilibrium.
Example 3 Suppose that there are three types of consumers in the population. For simplicity, we
will describe their types by the combinations of their cost and WTP for insurance: (c1 , v1 ) , (c2 , v2 )
and (c3 , v3 ) . Let qj denote the probability that a consumer is of type cj , vj , j 2 {1, 2, 3} , in the
⇥
⇤
P
population. Suppose that c1 < c2 < c3 and c2 = j2{1,2,3} qj cj = E c (M ) so that c2 is exactly the
average risk type m† as defined in (9).
Now suppose that the market equilibrium price p⇤ is such that only type 1 consumers are purchasing insurance, i.e., that the market equilibrium exhibits negative correlation property. For this
to be an equilibrium, it must be the case that the equilibrium price p⇤ = (1 + `) c1 and it satisfies
max {v2 , v3 } < p⇤  v1 .

(12)

However, this inequality is ruled out by the assumption (11), which for this example is reduced to
1+`

v2
.
c2

(13)

To see this, note that (13) implies that
p⇤ = (1 + `) c1 

v2
c 1 < v2 ,
c2

(14)

which is a contradiction against (12), implying that type 2 consumers would have preferred to
purchase insurance as well at p⇤ .
The logic underlying Propositions 1 and 2 suggests that, in contrast to the view expressed by
Chetty and Finkelstein (2013), whether multidimensional private information, particularly private
information related to risk preferences, can explain the observed negative correlation between insurance purchase and ex post risk realization must be related to large loading factors in the insurance
market, or non-competitive features of the insurance market.18
18

Chetty and Finkelstein (2013) stated that “... if preferences are sufficiently important determinants of demand
for insurance and sufficiently negatively correlated with risk type, the market can exhibit what has come to be called
advantageous selection.” This view was shared by many others in the literature.

11

It is also useful to point out that, to the extent that the loading factor in the insurance market
reflects the costs of administrating insurance sales and processing claims, competitive pressure
in the insurance market will drive down such costs. As such, the loading factor in a perfectly
competitive insurance market is likely to be low, suggesting the applicability of Proposition 2.19
The di↵erent findings in Chiappori and Salanié (2000) and Cohen (2005) we mentioned in the
introduction can potentially result from the di↵erential loading factors in the two markets. Recall
that Cohen’s (2005) data is from an online Israeli insurer, while Chiappori and Salanié’s (2005) is
from a traditional French insurance company. The online insurer is likely to have a much lower
loading than the traditional insurer. Therefore Proposition 2 suggests that positive correlation
property is more likely to hold in the Israeli data.

4.1

Relationship to CJSS (2006)

Let us now discuss in details the connections between our Propositions 1-2 and the results
in CJSS (2006). Formally, using the notation in CJSS, a contract Ci reimburses the insured an
amount Ri (L) when loss L occurs, and they say that contract C2 covers more than contract C1 if
R2 (L) R1 (L) is nondecreasing in L. Let
⇡ (Ci ) = pi

Z

Ri (L) dFi (L)

denote the per contract profit from contract Ci where Fi (L) is the distribution of loss among
consumers purchasing contract Ci , and is the fixed costs associated with the contract, and it
is assumed to be the same across the contracts. The nonincreasing profit (NIP) condition states
that ⇡ (C2 )  ⇡ (C1 ) if contract C2 covers more than C1 . CJSS’s main result, Proposition 2
(p. 789), states that under assumptions on consumer rationality (which we also assume) and the
nonincreasing profit condition, it must be true that
Z
Z
R2 (L) dF2 (L)
R2 (L) dF1 (L) .
(15)
In the notation of our paper, the case we considered in Proposition 1 is the case with
= 0,
20
R2 (L) = xL and R1 (L) = 0 where L = C (M ) . The NIP condition is automatically satisfied
in out competitive market setting because of the zero profit condition. Under this interpretation,
CJSS’s inequality (15) is equivalent to

19

h
i
E c(M )|B p⇤

h
i
E c(M )|N B p⇤ ,

However, de Meza and Webb (2001, p. 250) note that “Between 1985 and 1995 for U.K. insurers, expenses as
a percentage of premium income averaged 25% for motor insurance and 37% for property damage insurance.” Note
that such levels of average expense/premium ratio can still be consistent with the sufficient condition stipulated in
Proposition 2, which is a condition imposed only on the average risk type.
20
When > 0, CJSS’s Proposition 1 can not be used to show that the average ex post realization of risk for the
insured is higher than the uninsured, as CJSS pointed out in their Footnote 5 (p. 789).

12

which is exactly the same as our result stated in Proposition 1.
When there is a proportional loading factor ` > 0, the per contract profit from contract Ci is
then
Z
⇡ (Ci ) = pi (1 + `) Ri (L) dFi (L) ,
and CJSS show that their testable implication is given by (their inequality (7) on p. 790, with tax
rate t = 0):21

(16)

Again, if we let R2 (L) = xL and R1 (L) = 0 where L = C (M ) to match the setting considered in
our Proposition 2, the inequality (16) can be simplified as
⇥
⇤
E c(M )|B (p)

⇥
⇤
E c(M )|N B (p)

which does not correspond to the positive correlation property even if the loading factor ` is sufficiently small. Indeed, CJSS comment that (p. 791), “... we can test some well-defined implication
of asymmetric information (which may not look like a positive correlation property any more)”
[italics added]. We thus consider our Proposition 2 a new result to the literature.

Monopolistic Insurance Market

In this section, we focus on the other extreme of the insurance market structure, assuming
that there is a monopolistic insurance firm. We ask whether correlated multidimensional private
information can lead to the emergence of negative correlation property (see Definition 1) in a
monopolistic insurance market.
We first provide some background on how we will model dependence of the two dimensional private information M and ⇤. In Section 3, we stated that, in the population, consumers’ type, (m, ) ,
is independently drawn from joint CDF H(m, ), with marginal CDFs for M and ⇤ respectively
denoted by F (·) and G (·) . It turns out to be easier to parameterize the dependence structure of
the two random variables M and ⇤ using the concept of copula.22 By Sklar’s Theorem, for every
joint distribution H (m, ), there exists a unique copula C(·, ·) such that H(m, ) = C(F (m), G( )).
That is, the dependence structure between M and ⇤ can be represented by a copula and remains
unchanged under strictly increasing transformations of the random variables.

5.1

Positive Dependence

We first consider the case of positive dependence between risk type M and risk preference type
⇤. Although intuition suggests that positive correlation between risk and risk preference would

exacerbate adverse selection and thus strengthen positive correlation between insurance coverage
and ex post realization of risk, here we provide a precise sufficient condition for such a conclusion.
Definition 2 (Positive Stochastic Monotonicity Dependence) ⇤ is stochastically increasing
in M if Pr(⇤ > |M = m) is a nondecreasing function of m for all .
Nelson (2006, Corollary 5.2.11, p. 160) proved that Definition 2 is equivalent to C11 (z1 , z2 )  0
for all (z1 , z2 ) 2 [0, 1]2 in the language of copula. Positive stochastic dependence means that a high
realization of z1 shifts the conditional distribution of z2 according to first-order stochastic dominance. Because marginal distribution functions are monotonic, this property of copula translate
directly into corresponding dependence property of the joint distribution of (M, ⇤).
Proposition 3 (Positive Stochastic Monotonicity Dependence Implies Positive Correlation Property) Suppose Assumption 1 is satisfied. If ⇤ is stochastically increasing in M , then
positive correlation property holds under any market structure.

5.2

Negative Dependence

Now we consider the case in which the risk type M and the risk preference type ⇤ exhibit
negative dependence (to be made precise below) and investigate whether negative dependence
between M and ⇤ may lead to the emergence of negative correlation property under a monopolistic
market structure.
In this section, we consider the tractable case of CARA utility function and normally distributed
shocks as described in Example 2. Note that for this CARA-normal specification, it is without loss
of generality to assume that x = 1;23 thus from (3), we have C(✓) = m, and

We will interpret the parameter k ⌘ 2 /2, where 2 is the variance of the health expenditure shock,

5.2.1

The Role of Preferences

We study the e↵ect of the relative importance between risk and preferences, i.e., the magnitude
of k defined in (17), holding fixed the joint distribution H(·, ·).
Proposition 4 Suppose that consumers have CARA utility functions and experience normally
distributed risks as described in Example 2. For every H (·, ) , there exists a threshold k † > 0 such

When p 2 m + k , E [M ] + k , if a consumer’s risk type m is such that m E [M ] , then her
WTP v (m, ) m + k
E [M ] + k > p, thus such a consumer will for sure purchase insurance
at price p. Thus, all the consumers who do not purchase insurance must have risk type m < E [M ] ,

Proposition 4 shows that if risk preference is not a sufficiently important determinant of the
demand for insurance, then negative correlation property will not emerge under monopolistic market
structure, regardless of the joint distribution, H(·, ·), of risk and risk preferences. Notice that this
holds true even when the risk type M and the risk preference type ⇤ exhibit strong negative
dependence. Figure 2 illustrates why this is so for the extreme case when M and ⇤ exhibit perfect
negative dependence. Since M and ⇤ are perfectly negative dependent, there exists a one-to-one
monotonic mapping between m and , which is shown in the dashed line in Figure 2. A sufficiently
small k yields a steep iso-WTP curve, which would imply that for any price in (m + k , m + k ),
the iso-WTP curve that separates purchasers and no-purchasers of insurance at that price would
intersect the dashed line as depicted: the higher risks (the darker segment of the dashed line) always
purchase insurance before the lower risks (the lighter segment of the dashed line). This results in
positive correlation property.
Intuitively, when k is sufficiently small, a change in the price charged by the monopolist will have
a stronger influence on the support of risk type M rather than that of ⇤; as a result, the market is
more susceptible to the risk-based adverse selection problem as in the case of one-dimensional private information in risk, and the potential countervailing e↵ect of selection based on risk preferences
is too weak to override the positive correlation property.
Now we consider the other limiting case, and show that if risk preference is a sufficiently important determinant factor for the demand of insurance, then when risk M and risk preference ⇤
are negatively dependent (to be defined more precisely below), a monopolistic market may exhibit
negative correlation property in equilibrium. To this end, we first introduce the notion of negative
quadrant dependence:
Definition 3 (Strict Negative Quadrant Dependence) M and ⇤ are strictly negatively quadrant dependent if for all (m, ) 2 [m, m] ⇥ [ , ],
H(m, ) < F (m)G( ).

Strict negative quadrant dependence formalizes the notion that two random variables are negatively dependent if greater values of M are more likely to appear with smaller values of ⇤ and vice
versa. In the language of copula, it is equivalent to C(z1 , z2 ) < z1 z2 .24 Notice that independent
random variables does not satisfy strict negative quadrant dependence.25
Proposition 5 Suppose that consumers have CARA utility functions and experience normally
distributed risks as described in Example 2. If M and ⇤ are strictly negatively quadrant dependent,
24

Many families of copulas that include C(z1 , z2 ) = z1 z2 have subfamilies of positively quadrant dependent and
negatively quadrant dependent copulas. For instance, the Mardia family, the FGM family, the Ali-Mikhail-Haq family
and the Frank family (see Nelson 2006).
25
It is useful to point out that negative quadrant dependence is a weaker notion of negative dependence than
negative stochastic monotonicity dependence (also known as negative regression dependence, see Nelson 2006), which
is the opposite of the positive stochastic monotonicity dependence we introduced in Definition 2. Formally, we say that
two random variables M and ⇤ have negative stochastic monotonicity dependence if one is stochastically decreasing
in the other; for example, ⇤ is stochastically decreasing in M if Pr(⇤ > |M = m) is a nonincreasing function of m
for all .
Negative stochastic monotonicity dependence is in turn implied by and thus weaker than negative likelihood ratio
dependence (see Bromek and Pleszczyńska (1991, p.115). We say that M and ⇤ are negatively likelihood ratio
dependent if
h(m, )h(m0 , 0 )  h(m0 , )h(m, 0 )
for all m  m0 and

> E [M ] for k > k †† .
The intuition for Proposition 5 is as follows. When risk aversion is a sufficiently important
determinant of the demand for insurance, the iso-WTP curve is sufficiently flat in the (m, ) space.
Thus, a change in the price by the monopolistic firm will have a stronger impact on the distribution
of the risk aversion type than the distribution of risk types among the set of the purchasers; that
is, the selection of the consumers are more based on risk aversion type than on risk type m. In
the limit when k is sufficiently large, it is profit maximizing for the monopolist to price in a way
to select only consumers whose risk aversion is above ⇤ as defined by (19). Because higher risk
aversion is associated with lower risk type by the assumption of quadrant negative dependence,
21

consumers who purchase insurance have lower average risk than the entire population.
Proposition 5 represents a striking di↵erence from the result reported in Proposition 1 for
the case of perfectly competitive market, where we show that negative correlation property will
not emerge under any joint distribution of M and ⇤. To better explain the intuition why market
structure plays such an important role in whether or not negative dependence between M and ⇤ can
lead to negative correlation property in equilibrium, it is useful to further examine the di↵erence,
when k gets large, between the competitive equilibrium price p⇤ and the monopolistic price pm (k) .
In Lemma 1 we showed that under monopoly, pm (k) /k converges to ⇤ when k gets large. The
following claim shows that p⇤ (k) /k – we use p⇤ (k) to indicate the competitive equilibrium price
when the relative importance parameter of the risk preference in WTP is k – will be converging to
a smaller value than ⇤ .
Claim 1 Suppose that consumers have CARA utility functions and experience normally distributed
risks as described in Example 2. Under perfect competition, there exists a threshold k̃ ⇤ such that
p⇤ (k)  E [M ] + k for k > k̃ ⇤ .
Proof. Let k̃ ⇤ =

which is a contradiction to the zero profit condition required for competitive equilibrium.

Claim 1 implies that as k gets sufficiently large, p k(k) will converge to something smaller than ;
m
in contrast, p k(k) converges to ⇤ > . The di↵erence between competitive and monopolistic market
structure can be understood as follows. As k gets larger, it becomes less costly for the insurance
firms to o↵er insurance due to the increase in the WTP for insurance for consumers of all risk types.
This is true for both the competitive and the monopolistic market structure. However, in a perfectly
competitive market, the competitive pressure will force insurance companies to reduce prices and
cover more consumers, leading to a low price level in equilibrium. Claim 1 establishes that the
competitive equilibrium price is lower than E [M ] + k when k is sufficiently large. As a result, only
consumers with low risk (lower than the unconditional expectation) and low degree of risk aversion
choose to opt out (the lower dashed line in Figure 3). This implies directly that consumers with
no insurance have lower average risk than the entire population.26 In contrast, a monopolistic firm
recognizes that, when M and ⇤ exhibit strong negative dependence, most densities concentrate on
the diagonal as indicated in Figure 3. To maximize profit, a monopolist will choose a higher price

5.2.2

Comparative Statics with Respect to the Degree of Negative Dependence

Proposition 5 is a limiting result under monopoly as the role of preference as a determinant of the
demand for insurance becomes sufficiently important. In this subsection, we further parameterize
the nature of the negative dependence between M and ⇤, and examine its impact on the equilibrium
outcomes of the monopolistic market, including premium and market size and the correlation
between insurance purchase and ex post realization of risk.
To this end, we assume that both M and ⇤ are uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, and the
joint distribution of M and ⇤ can be represented by a Bivariate Fréchet copula parameterized by
µ 2 [0, 1]:
C(z1 , z2 ; µ) = µW(z1 , z2 ) + (1 µ)⇧(z1 , z2 ),
(20)
where ⇧(z1 , z2 ) ⌘ z1 z2 is the product copula that exhibits independence and W(z1 , z2 ) ⌘ max{z1 +
z2 1, 0} is the Fréchet lower bound that shows perfect negative dependence between u and v.

23

Hence, the parameter µ measures the degree of negative dependence between z1 and z2 . With a
slight abuse of notation, we use pm (µ) to denote the monopolist’s profit maximizing premium, and
use D pm (µ) to denote the measure of consumers who will purchase insurance at the monopolist’s
price pm (µ). We know from Proposition 1 that positive correlation property emerges for all k and
µ if the market structure is perfect competition. For the case of monopolistic market structure, we
have the following result:
Proposition 6 Suppose that consumers have CARA utility functions and experience normally
distributed risks as described in Example 2, and the joint distribution is H(m, ; µ) = µW(m, ) +
(1 µ)⇧(m, ). Assume M ⇠ U [0, 1] and ⇤ ⇠ U [0, 1]. Suppose the market structure is monopoly.
Then,
1. if k < 1, positive correlation property emerges for all µ;
2. if k > 1, there exists a threshold µ† such that:
(a) negative correlation property emerges if µ > µ† ; and positive correlation property emerges
if µ < µ† ;
(b) dpm (µ) dµ < 0 and dD(pm (µ)) dµ > 0.
Proof. (1). Suppose that k < 1. First consider ⇧ (m, ) , which is the joint distribution when M
and ⇤ are independent, which trivially satisfies the definition of positive stochastic monotonicity
dependence (see Definition 2). Thus Proposition 3 applies; and thus, for all p 2 (0, k + 1), we must
have:27

The monopolist takes advantage of the increasing negative dependence between risk and risk
aversion. In particular, when these two consumer characteristics become more negatively dependent, the monopolistic insurer has an incentive to set a high premium to rule out the “bad risks.” As
a result, the monopolist optimally chooses a price in the region where negative correlation property
emerges.

Local Adverse/Advantageous Selection and Positive/Negative
Correlation Property

In this section, we use the example we analyzed in the previous section to clarify the connections between some important concepts related to selection markets, such as adverse/advantageous
selection and positive/negative correlation property. In the classic models of insurance with onedimensional consumer heterogeneity in risk types (e.g., Arrow 1963, Pauly 1974, Rothschild and
Stiglitz 1976 and Wilson 1977), adverse selection refers to the idea that the average risk of those
who choose to purchase insurance worsens as the insurance premium rises. The reason is very
simple: as premium rises, the marginal consumer to drop out of coverage is the least risky among
the insured in a one-dimensional model. To the extent that the average risks will translate into
average cost of coverage for the insurance company, this translates into average cost curve (and the
marginal cost curve) being an increasing function of price.29
Einav, Finkelstein and Cullen (2010) generalize this insight to models of potential multidimen29

Or equivalently, the average (and the marginal) cost curve is a decreasing function of the fraction insured because
the fraction insured is a monotonically decreasing function of the price.

26

sional consumer heterogeneity. Their approach to test for the nature of selection in the insurance
market treats the marginal cost curve as a sufficient statistics for the distribution of consumers’
potentially multidimensional heterogeneity, and to the extent that researchers have access to exogenous price variations to estimate the marginal cost curve, it would indeed be a very attractive
approach relative to a fully structural alternative.
The first clarification we would like to make in this section is the following: in models with
multidimensional consumer heterogeneity, average cost and marginal cost curves are generically
non-monotonic functions of premium.30 Thus, it is useful to define a local notion of selection based
on how the marginal cost curve, which we will denote by M C (p) , is locally related to the premium
change:
Definition 4 (Local Adverse/Advantageous Selection) The market is said to be subject to
local adverse selection at price p if M C 0 (p) > 0. Similarly, the market is said to be subject to local
advantageous selection at price p if M C 0 (p) < 0.
Remark 3 If consumers have one-dimensional heterogeneity in risk, local selection is always adverse, as the marginal insurer buyer is always riskier as the premium increases; thus there is no distinction in the notion of local selection and global selection. Moreover, in the one-dimensional heterogeneity model, the average cost curve, which we denote by AC (p) , is always above the marginal
cost curve except at the price levels that exceed the maximum WTP for insurance (where the two
curves coincide). Thus AC 0 (p) > 0.
Remark 3 also implies that local advantageous selection is a phenomenon that may arise only
when consumer heterogeneity is multidimensional.
Remark 4 When consumers have multidimensional heterogeneity, whether AC (p) is increasing
(or decreasing) at p depends on whether AC (p) is larger (or smaller) than M C (p) . Thus, marginal
cost curve locally increasing at p does not imply, and is not implied by the average cost locally
increasing at p.
In contrast, the concept of positive or negative correlation property (see Definition 1 for the case
of competitive market structure, but can be obviously generalized to any market structure) refers
to whether the equilibrium correlation between insurance purchase and ex post realization or risk is
positive or negative. It is a property of the equilibrium, which depends on the complete distribution
of consumer heterogeneity, while the local adverse/advantageous selection is determined by the local
properties of the distribution of consumer heterogeneity on the iso-WTP sub-space. The market
30

As we pointed out in Footnote 6, Einav and Finkelstein (2011) note this as well in a footnote in their paper, but
proceed assuming monotonicity. Mahoney and Weyl (2016) also realize that importance of studying non-monotone
cost curves (footnote 5, p. 4): “It is possible that these slopes have di↵erent signs over di↵erent ranges or that the
two have slopes of di↵erent signs over a particular range. All of these cases do not fall cleanly into one category
or the other and are not our focus in what follows. It would be interesting to extend our analysis to such cases.”
Our discussion below is to emphasize that the non-monotonicity is a generic property of models of multidimensional
heterogeneity.

27

equilibrium price depends on the market structure, of course; in the price-cost graph as in Figure 4
below, the competitive market equilibrium price is determined by the intersection of the 45 degree
line with AC (p) curve, while the monopolistic equilibrium price is determined by the intersection
of the marginal revenue curve, which is p + D (p) /D0 (p) , with M C (p) curve.
Now we illustrate the notions of local adverse/advantageous selection in the context of the
example environment we studied in Section 5.2.2. We define, as a function of premium p, the
demand for insurance, the total (expected) cost, the average (expected) cost and the marginal
(expected) cost at price p are equal to:

Let us focus on the case where k > 1.
When µ = 0, i.e., when the risk type and risk preference type are independent and uniformly
distributed, M C(p; µ = 0) is given by:

It can be verified that M C(p; µ = 0) is nondecreasing in p.31 Hence, the AC curve lies above the
M C curve and is increasing in p for p 2 [0, k + 1]. This corresponds to the graphical representation
of adverse selection in Einav, Finkelstein and Cullen (2010) and Mahoney and Weyl (2016). It
is worth noting that the monotonicity of M C and AC in this example is a sufficient but not a
necessary condition for the emergence of positive correlation property under any market structure.
Indeed, from Proposition 3 we must have AC(p) > AC(m + k ) = E [M ] for p 2 (m + k , m + k )
when µ = 0 regardless the shape of cost curves.
When µ = 1, i.e., when M and ⇤ are perfectly negative dependent, M C(p; µ = 1) is given by,

The joint distribution H(·, ·) degenerates to a one-dimensional distribution and there exists a oneto-one mapping between m and . In particular = 1 m. Consumer’s WTP is k + (1 k)m,
31

If M and ⇤ are not uniformly distributed as in this example, the independence of M and ⇤ does not generally
imply that the MC curve in terms of p is monotonic. See Example 4 below for a construction.

which is decreasing in m when k > 1. Therefore, the lower risk types have higher WTP for a given
price. This implies directly that the risk of the marginal consumer is decreasing as price increases
and AC(p) is decreasing in p. This corresponds to the graphical representation of advantageous
selection in Einav, Finkelstein and Cullen (2010) and Mahoney and Weyl (2016).

It can be verified that MC is non-monotone in p. As depicted in Figure 4, the MC curve is increasing
in p for p 2 [0, 1] and p 2 [k, k + 1], and decreasing for p 2 [1, k].
The non-monotonicity of the MC curve is not a unique property of this example. In fact,
when we hmodel
i dependence on the joint distribution with positive density almost everywhere on
[m, m] ⇥ , , it is impossible to obtain a globally decreasing MC curve. To see this, notice
that only consumers with high risks purchase insurance when the price is below but sufficiently
close to the maximum price m + k . Hence, the MC is high when price is close to m. By the

29

same token, when the price decreases gradually and is approaching to the minimum price m + k ,
the additional consumers are those with low risks. In other words, MC is low (close to m) near
the lowest price. Therefore, MC always starts up low and ends up high. For negative correlation
property to emerge, MC needs to change its monotonicity at least twice as Figure 4 illustrates.
Only under joint distribution functions that puts zero density on certain combinations of (m, ) is
it possible to obtain a globally decreasing MC curve. For example, when M and ⇤ exhibit perfectly
negative dependence (i.e. µ = 1), the MC curve is globally decreasing as in Einav, Finkelstein and
Cullen (2010) and Mahoney and Weyl (2016).
Having clarified the distinction between the local notion of adverse/advantageous selection in
models of multidimensional heterogeneity and the equilibrium (and thus global) notion of positive/negative correlation property, the following claim discusses their connections:
Claim 2 (Connection between Local Advantageous/Adverse Selection and Equilibrium
Negative/Positive Correlation Property)
1. If the market exhibits negative correlation property in equilibrium, then the market is subject
to local advantageous selection at some prices.
2. However, the reverse does not hold.
3. Moreover, it is possible that selection is locally advantageous at the equilibrium price p⇤ , yet
the market exhibits positive correlation property in equilibrium.
The first part of Claim 2 is obvious. Suppose that the market is subject to local adverse
selection for all prices. Then M C(p) is increasing in p for all p by definition. It follows immediately
⇥
⇤
that AC(p) is increasing in p globally, which implies that E c(M )|B (p⇤ ) = AC (p⇤ ) > AC (0) =
⇥
⇤
E c(M ) . We provide an example to illustrate the second and third part of Claim 2.

Discussions

Clarifying the distinction between local selection (adverse or advantageous) and the equilibrium
positive/negative correlation is important. As noted by de Meza and Webb (2016), this distinction
is sometimes not clearly made. Einav, Finkelstein and Levin (2010, p.316) state that, “contract j
is adversely selected if the expected cost of insuring j’s enrollees under contract j is greater than
the expected cost of insuring the population I under contract j” and is advantageously selected
otherwise. This is in fact referring to the equilibrium positive or negative correlation property.
In contrast, Einav, Finkelstein and Cullen (2010, p. 879) state that “... the sign of the slope of
the marginal cost curve tells us whether the resultant selection is adverse (or the marginal cost is
increasing in price) or advantageous (if marginal cost is decreasing in price.” In our terminology, this
is a local definition of adverse or advantageous selection. Since the marginal cost curve is generically
non-monotonic in price, a property Einav, Finkelstein and Cullen (2010) do not emphasize but
Einav and Finkelstein (2011, footnote 7, p. 124) do acknowledge, the two notions will often reach

di↵erent conclusions under multiple consumer heterogeneity,, as explicitly shown in our Claim 2
above. This is a point that was already made by de Meza and Webb (2016) in their two-type (bad
and good risks) example, where they also argue that the local sign of the slope of the average cost
with respect to quantity, which may not be monotonic, can be a useful measure of selection as well.
Azevedo and Gottlieb (2016) introduce a notion of intensive margin selection coefficient that
measures the di↵erence between the marginal changes of the premium and the marginal increase in
the cost of insuring the consumers choosing a particular level of coverage, if they were to switch to
a contract with an infinitesimally better coverage. Notice that their notion is with respect to the
local changes in coverage, as supposed to the local changes in the premium used in our definition
of local adverse/advantageous selection. They suggest that this notion is related to the positive
correlation test. Indeed if the intensive margin selection coefficient is positive (negative), it means
that, locally, there is a positive (negative) correlation between the ex post risk realization and
the insurance coverage generosity. More importantly, the intensive margin selection coefficient not
only provides the sign of the correlation but also the magnitude of the positive correlation. They
state that “It is possible that there is adverse selection in one region of the contract space, and
advantageous selection in another region.” In Section 8 below, we show in Proposition 8 that under
a set of mild conditions, the multiple contract competitive equilibrium exhibits positive correlation
property throughout the contract space. We will provide further connections between their intensive
margin selection coefficient and the standard correlation test after we present Proposition 8.

Imperfectly Competitive Insurance Market

In this section, we generalize the market structure and study imperfect competition. We model
imperfectly competitive insurance market as follows.32 Suppose that there are two insurance firms
on the market where they engage in a modified “Bertrand competition” by setting a price for
insurance of quality x. Di↵erent from the standard Bertrand model, we assume that consumers
cannot compare prices perfectly; instead, a consumer receives a noisy signal regarding which of the
two firms has a lower price, and then he/she inspects the actual price of the firm indicated by the
noisy signal, and finally he/she decides whether to buy the product accordingly.33, 34 The noisy
signal regarding which firm has the lower price creates spurious product di↵erentiation and gives
rise to market power to firms and thus induces imperfect competition.
Specifically, after firm i 2 {1, 2} posts price pi , each consumer receives a signal s 2 {1, 2} about
32

Our approach of modeling imperfect competition is in the same spirit as Fisher and Plan (2015).
It is assumed that the consumer cannot switch to the other firm once the price of the chosen firm fully reveals.
This specification of the consumer behavior can be rationalized by a sufficiently high switching cost.
34
Note that our approach to parameterize the imperfect competition is related to but distinct from from Lester et
al. (2016). In their paper they assume that a buyer samples one o↵er with probability p1 2 (0, 1) and two o↵ers with
probability p2 = 1 p1 . The higher p2 is, the more fierce the competition is.
33

which firm has the lower price as follows: given (p1 , p2 ) ,
s=

(

1 if p1 p2 + ✏  0
2 otherwise,

where ✏ ⇠ N (0, s2 ).35 It is clear that a consumer always follows the signal: if s = i, she will find
out the actual price pi and decide between purchasing insurance at price pi and staying uninsured.
Hence, conditional
⇣ on the
⌘ price vector (p1 , p2 ), the probability that a consumer considers purchasing
pj pi 36
from firm i is
. Conditional on observing firm i0 s price pi , the purchase decision of types
✓ consumer remains the same as before: she will purchase insurance at price pi if and only if
v (✓; x) pi , i.e., if and only if ✓ 2 B (pi ) where B (·) is defined in (1). Note that s2 represents a
measure of the market competitiveness. When s2 = 0, consumers always buy from the firm with
the lower price, which indicates fierce price competition. When s2 = 1, the signal is completely
uninformative and the consumer randomly chooses between the two o↵ers and each firm behaves
as if they were a monopoly.
Now we can set up the strategic pricing game between the two firms. Fixing pj , firm i chooses
pi to maximize the expected profit:

where ⇡ (·) is defined in (4). Notice that a nice feature of our formulation of the imperfect competition is that the price competition between the two firms only a↵ects which firm is in the
consideration set of the consumer, not the subsequent decision of whether to purchase the insurance.

Assumption 3 (i) ⇡(p) is strictly single-peaked in p for p 2 v((m, ); x), v((m, ); x) ; (ii)
maxp 0 {⇡(p)} > 0; (iii) ⇡(p) is di↵erentiable and log-concave in p 2 (p⇤ , pm ], and ⇡ 0 (pm ) = 0
where p⇤ is the competitive equilibrium price and pm is the monopolist’s profit maximizing price.37
The di↵erentiability and single-peakedness of the profit function guarantees that the profit
function under monopoly is well-behaved and the first-order condition is sufficient to pin down
the optimal price; and maxp 0 {⇡(p)} > 0 ensures that a monopolistic insurer will not exit the
market. Finally, as it will be clear later, log-concavity ensures the symmetry and uniqueness of the
equilibrium.

The assumption of Gaussian noise can be easily relaxed. All the results obtained in this section can be generalized
to a noise Z parameterized by ↵ 2 [↵,

@z < 0; (iii) @ (0; ↵) @↵ > 0; (iv) lim↵!↵ (0; ↵) = 0 and lim↵!↵ (0; ↵) = 1.

An alternative way of modeling is to assume that each potential consumer receives two signals si = pi + ✏i and
examine the price of the firm with the lower signal, where ✏i is assumed to be independently identically distributed
according to a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance s2 /2.

Next, we show that if an equilibrium exists, it must be symmetric. Suppose to the contrary that

Therefore, p̂⇤1 < p̂⇤2 from Assumption 3, a contradiction. Imposing the symmetry condition p̂⇤1 =
p̂⇤2 = pe to the above first order condition yields equation (25).
Lastly, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium. From the definition of p⇤ and
Assumption 3, ⇡ 0 (pm ) = 0 and ⇡(p⇤ ) = 0, which implies directly that limpe !p⇤ ⇡ 0 (pe )/⇡(pe ) = 1
and limpe !pm ⇡ 0 (pe )/⇡(pe ) = 0. Therefore, for any s2 > 0, there exists a unique solution to equation
(25). This completes the proof.

The proof follows immediately from Assumption 3 that ⇡ (p) is log-concave. This result is

insurance market becomes more competitive.

Extension: Endogenizing the Contracts

In the basic model, the quality of the insurance is predetermined, and hence we are comparing
no purchase with purchasing x 2 (0, 1]. In this section we relax this assumption and show that the
main results derived in both the competitive and monopolistic case are indeed robust.

8.1

Competitive Insurance Market: Endogenous Contract

Consider a perfectly competitive market. Instead of allowing the competing insurance firms to
choose the quality of the contract arbitrarily, we assume that a firm can provide contracts from a set
X = {x0 , x1 , · · · , xN } with 0 = x0 < x1 < · · · < xN  1, where x0 refers to the null contract costing
nothing (i.e., C(✓; x0 ) ⌘ x0 ·c(m) = 0) and providing zero utility (i.e., v(✓; x0 ) = 0) to all consumers.
This approach allows us to endogenize the insurance quality with a minimal departure from the
basic model we considered in Section 3. We would like to study whether negative correlation or
positive correlation property will emerge in equilibrium when comparing xi versus xj for i < j, as
well as those who do not purchase. Denote the price of contract xi by pi for i 2 {0, 1, · · · , N }.
Fixing the premium vector p = (p0 , p1 , · · · , pN ), denote the set and measure of consumers that
selects xi by Bi (p) and Di (p) respectively, that is,
Bi (p) ⌘

Next, we define the employed equilibrium notion, which borrows from Azevedo and Gottlieb
(2016). This definition corresponds to the weak equilibrium in Azevedo and Gottlieb (2016).
Definition 5 The price vector p⇤ = (p⇤0 , p⇤1 , · · · , p⇤N ) is a competitive equilibrium if
i. For each contract xi , firms make no profits.
ii. Consumers make purchase decision and choose contracts optimally.
This price-taking definition requires firms to earn zero profits on each contract (either with
positive or zero demand) and hence rules out cross-subsidies between contracts.39 The existence of
equilibrium is guaranteed by Theorem 1 and Proposition 1 in Azevedo and Gottlieb (2016). It is
worth noting that the equilibrium premium of the null contract is zero if the corresponding demand
is strictly positive.
Next, we define positive and negative correlation property with multiple contracts. It is useful to
denote the set of contracts that induces positive insurance demand by X̃(p) and the corresponding
price vector by p̃ holding fixed p and X.

negative correlation property if E c(M )|Bi (p⇤ ) < E c(M )|Bj (p⇤ ) .
We assume that the insurance coverage x a↵ects consumers’ WTP in the natural way. Specifically, we impose the following assumptions on v (·):
Assumption 4 @v/@x

c(m).

Assumption 4 simply says that consumer’s WTP for an additional unit of insurance quality is
no less than the cost to the insurance firms. Assumption 4 implies and is a natural extension of
Assumption 2 for the multiple contract case.
Assumption 5 @ 2 v/@m@x > 0 and @ 2 v/@ @x > 0.
Assumption 5 states that consumer’s marginal WTP for insurance quality of the contract coverage (i.e. @v/@x) is increasing in her risk type and in her risk preference type.
39
As argued by Azevedo and Gottlieb (2016), this equilibrium concept can be justified as the limit of a strategic
model with di↵erentiated products. The intuition is simple: a firm that cross-subsidizes contracts has incentives to
sell contracts with positive profits only.

Denote the iso-WTP curve v(✓; xi ) pi = 0 by = Ii (m). Assumption 6 simply says that
the single-crossing condition holds for the iso-WTP curves of insurance coverage xi > xj > 0.
Specifically, Ii (m) and Ij (m) intersect at most once in the (m, )-space. Moreover, the iso-WTP
curve Ii (m) is steeper than Ij (m) at the intersection if they intersect.
It is clear that Assumption 4, 5 and 6 are satisfied in Example 2. To see this, recall that
consumer’s WTP for insurance is given by v(✓; x) = xm + x(22 x) 2 . Therefore, @v/@x = m + (1
x) 2
c(m), @ 2 v/@m@x = 1 > 0, and @ 2 v/@ @x = (1 x) 2 0, and Assumption 5 is satisfied.

and hence Assumption 6 is satisfied.
Consider a pair of contracts (xi , pi ) and xj , pj with xi 6= xj . Due to Assumption 1, the set of
consumer types that are indi↵erent between the two contracts, namely, ✓ : v(✓; xi ) pi = v(✓; xj ) pj ,
can be represented by an indi↵erence curve, which we denote by = Iij (m) for i 6= j. It is obvious
that Iij (m) = Iji (m). When one of the contract pair is (x0 , 0) , i.e., the null insurance, then the
indi↵erence curve between contract (xi , pi ) and (x0 , 0), namely, = Ii0 (m), coincides exactly with
the iso-WTP curve = Ii (m) defined previously. The following lemma illustrates some additional
properties of the indi↵erence curves.

Case III: I i0 (m) lies below I j0 (m).
This case is depicted by Figure 8(c). By the same argument
as in Case II, Iij (m) does not intersect with either Ii0 (m) or Ij0 (m), and Iij (m) must lie below
Ii (m) (See Figure 8(c)). This implies that a consumer whose type is above or on = Ii0 (m) will
purchase contract xi , p⇤i , and will
⇣ end ⌘up with no insurance otherwise. Therefore, there will be
no insurance demand for contract xj , p⇤j , a contradiction to Dj (p⇤ ) > 0.
Lemma 5 states that the unit price of the high quality insurance must be higher than that of
the low quality insurance in a competitive equilibrium. The intuition is as follows. Consumers
can be roughly classified into four groups based on their risk type (high risk v.s. low risk) and
risk preference type (high risk aversion v.s. low risk aversion). Single crossing condition of the
indi↵erence curves guarantees that consumers selecting the low quality insurance must have both
lower risk and lower risk aversion, and consumers of higher risk types (independent of risk preference
type) will select into the high quality insurance. This market segmentation is illustrated by Figure
8(a). Now suppose that the unit price of the high quality insurance is lower relative to that of
the low quality insurance. Then providing the low quality insurance helps the insurance firms to
maintain a high premium and to attract consumers of low risk type (and lower risk aversion). This
results in a net profit and contradicts to the zero profit condition required by the definition of
equilibrium. Therefore, the unit price of insurance has to be strictly increasing in the insurance
quality in a competitive equilibrium.40

Proposition 8 (Positive Correlation Property Holds in Competitive Equilibrium with
multiple contracts) Suppose Assumptions 1, 4, 5 and 6 are satisfied, |X̃(p⇤ )| 2 and x0 2 X̃(p⇤ ).
Then positive correlation property always holds in a competitive equilibrium without loadings.
Proof. Suppose |X̃(p⇤ )| = 2. Then Proposition 1 applies and positive correlation property must

We conjecture that we can use arguments analogous to those in the proof of Proposition 2 to show that positive
correlation property holds in competitive equilibrium with multiple contracts under a positive proportional loading
factor as long as it is sufficiently low.

To prove this, suppose there is only one contract of quality xs available on the market where
consumer characteristics are drawn from the set Bs (p⇤ ) [ B0 (p⇤ ). It is obvious that p⇤s is an
equilibrium price in such a market. Moreover, the set of buyers and the set of non-buyers of
contract xs are Bs (p⇤ ) and B0 (p⇤ ) respectively. We can thus apply Proposition 1 to conclude

It is useful to connect the result stated in Proposition 8 to the notion of the intensive margin
selection coefficient introduced in Azevedo and Gottlieb (2016), which they denoted by SI (x).
They defined SI (x) for continuous contract space, but it is easy to adapt it to our discrete
environment setting. Specially, the intensive margin selection coefficient evaluated at contract
xk , k = 0, 1, 2, ..., N 1 can be written as:

where the first term reflects the marginal premium change per unit increase in coverage locally

where the second equality follows from our assumption that C (✓; xi ) = xi · c (m) . Proposition 8
thus implies that in our setting the intensive margin selection coefficient SI (xk ) defined in Azevedo

they find changing signs of SI (·) at di↵erent levels of x feature heterogeneity in ex post moral
hazard, which may cause a violation of Assumption 1.

Monopolistic Insurance Market: Endogenous Contract

Now we consider a monopolistic insurance firm that chooses premium pm and insurance coverage
xm to:41
Z
max ⇡(p, x) ⌘
(p xm) dH(m, )
(31)
{p,x}

where B(p, x) is defined as

✓2B(p,x)

B (p, x) ⌘ ✓ : v(✓; x)

p

0 .

(32)

For tractability, we employ the expression of WTP derived from the CARA-normal specification
in Example 2, that is, v(✓; x) = xm + x (2 x) k . For this class of examples, we will use ⇡ (p, x; k)
and B (p, x; k) to indicate that both are related to the parameter k ⌘ 2 /2 as defined in (17),
which measures the relative importance of risk aversion as a determinant of the consumer’s WTP
for insurance. The following lemma can be implied immediately from the linearity of consumers’
WTP.
Lemma 6 Suppose v(✓; x) = xm + x (2

x) k , then ⇡(p, x; k) = x⇡(p/x, 1; (2

x)k).

The proof follows directly from the fact that B(p, x; k) = B(p/x, 1; (2 x)k) and is omitted
for brevity. Lemma 6 uncovers the trade-o↵ between x and the degree of adverse selection in an
intuitive way: holding fixed the per-unit price of the insurance (i.e., p/x), increasing insurance
coverage x will directly increase the revenue received from each consumer that purchases insurance,
at the cost of yielding steeper iso-WTP curves in the (m, ) space, which indicates more severe
adverse selection.
41
Same as in Veiga and Weyl (2016), we assume the monopolist o↵ers a single contract instead of a menu of
contracts.

The Role of Preferences
Proposition 4 and 5.

The next two propositions report results that are parallel to those in

Proposition 9 Suppose that consumers have CARA utility functions and experience normally
distributed risks as described in Example 2. For every H (·, ) , there exists a threshold k̂ † > 0 such
⇥
⇤
that for all k < k̂ † , E M |B (p, x; k) > E [M ] for all p 2 (m + k , m + k ) and x 2 (0, 1].

x)k < 2k. Applying

Proposition 10 Suppose that consumers have CARA utility functions and experience normally
distributed risks as described in Example 2. If M and ⇤ are negatively quadrant dependent, then
there exists a threshold k̂ †† such that negative correlation property emerges under monopoly when
k > k̂ †† .

††
††
Proposition 5 with k̂ = k completes the proof.
Proposition 9 and 10 show that the results in Proposition 4 and 5 are robust to the endogenizing
of insurance quality in a monopolistic market. Before we explain the results, it is useful to discuss
the sources of advantageous selection. Because both the joint distribution of M and ⇤ and the
shape of the iso-WTP curves will influence firm’s cost curves, there are two sources of advantageous
selection in a model of multidimensional private information. The first source of advantageous
selection comes from the joint distribution of M and ⇤ as emphasized in Section 5.2.2. Intuitively,
negative dependence between M and ⇤ favors the monopolist and decreases firm’s cost of providing
insurance. The second source of advantageous selection is a result of the downward sloping nature
of the iso-WTP curves. Fixing the risk type, consumers of a high risk aversion type are more
willing to purchase insurance relative to those of a low risk aversion type. As a result, consumers
with low risk type and high risk aversion type will purchase insurance, mitigating adverse selection
compared to a model of one-dimensional private information in risk where the low risk type will
opt not to purchase insurance.
Fixing the joint distribution of M and ⇤, di↵erent from the model of exogenous insurance quality, the monopolist is able to choose insurance coverage x to change the composition of consumers
and hence mitigate adverse selection it faces. However, the impact of x in influencing selection
is limited. Formally, the absolute value of the slope of the iso-WTP curve is given by (2 x)k,
which is bounded from below by k and above by 2k. Therefore, the e↵ect of k in determining selection takes over as k becomes sufficiently large (respectively, small) and the result in Proposition
4 (respectively, Proposition 5) remains.
Impact of Dependence between M and ⇤ In this subsection we report numerical results
to shed some light on the role of dependence between M and ⇤ on the design of the optimal
contract, especially on the correlation between insurance purchase and ex post realization of risk.
44

To proceed, we assume that M ⇠ U [0, 1], ⇤ ⇠ U [0, 1], and the joint distribution is H(m, ; µ) =
µW(m, ) + (1 µ)⇧(m, ) as in Section 5.2.2. With slight abuse of notation, we denote the
monopolist’s optimal contract by pm (µ, k), xm (µ, k) .
We will first briefly describe the algorithm of searching for the optimal contract in the numerical
analysis.42 We use p̂m (µ, k) to denote the monopolist’s optimal premium fixing x = 1. We first
completely solve for p̂m (µ, k) for any k.
Suppose k > 1, we have already shown in (23) that the profit function is,

⇡(p, 1; k) =

For this special case, the profit function is discontinuous at p = 1. It can be verified that p̂m (µ, 1) =
1; and it can be verified that positive correlation property emerges in this case.
Lastly, suppose k < 1, the profit function is:43

the combination of (µ, k) for which negative correlation property (respectively, positive correlation

correlation property) emerges under optimal contract when k is sufficiently large (respectively,
small). This confirms the results in Proposition 9 and 10. Second, the result in Proposition 6 is

Conclusion

A large empirical literature has found that the correlation between insurance purchase and ex
post realization of risk is often statistically insignificant or negative, which is inconsistent with the
predictions from the classic models of insurance a la Akerlof (1970), Pauly (1974) and Rothschild
and Stiglitz (1976), where consumers di↵er only in their risk types. It is suggested that the selection
based on multidimensional private information, e.g., risk type and risk preference type, may be able
to reconcile the empirical findings. In this paper, we systematically investigate, under di↵erent
market structures, whether selection based on multidimensional private information can result in
negative correlation between insurance coverage and ex post realization of risk in equilibrium. We
show that if the insurance market is perfectly competitive, selection based on multidimensional
private information does not generate negative correlation property in equilibrium, unless there is
a sufficiently high loading factor. If the insurance market is monopolistic, however, we show that it is
possible to generate negative correlation property in equilibrium when risk type and risk preference
type are sufficiently negative dependent, a notion we formalize using the concept of copula. We
further show that this result generalizes to imperfectly competitive market structure, as well as when
contracts are partially endogenized. We also clarify the confusions in this growing literature about
the connections between some of the important concepts such as adverse/advantageous selection
and positive/negative correlation property.
There are some interesting directions for future research. First, in this paper we studied the
role of additional consumer heterogeneity in risk preference. It is important to model and examine
whether other sources of heterogeneity, such as heterogeneity in moral hazard (Einav et al., 2013)
and heterogeneity in imperfect rationality (e.g., Fang, Keane and Silverman, 2008), will lead to
di↵erent conclusions on the emergence of positive or negative correlation property. As we pointed
out in Footnote 11, introducing moral hazard is likely to lead to the violations of Assumption 1.
Heterogeneity in imperfect rationality will call for a plausible behavioral model of consumers’ insurance purchase decisions. Second, in our paper we have identified the potential role of loading factors
in possibly a↵ecting the equilibrium of the insurance market under di↵erent market structures. In
particular, Proposition 2 shows that a sufficiently small loading factor is sufficient to ensure that
positive correlation property always holds under a competitive insurance market regardless of the
dependence structure of the multidimensional heterogeneity. Loading factors can also drive a wedge
between the WTP for insurance and marginal cost (inclusive of loading factors) of providing coverage. Further investigations, empirically about the magnitude of loading factors, and theoretically
about how loading factors – potentially heterogeneous among insurance firms – may impact the
equilibrium of the insurance market, are also an important avenue for future research.
by the monopolist. Simulation shows that endogenizing x slightly shifts the contour plot to the left and enlarges the
region of negative correlation property under optimal contract. This result is intuitive: the monopolist can better
take advantage of the negative dependence of the joint distribution if it is allowed to design x. Therefore, negative
correlation property is more likely to emerge under optimal contract.

In this online appendix, we collect the materials omitted from the main text of the paper. The
appendices are ordered according to where they are first referenced in the main text. In Appendix
A we show that Assumption 1-2 are satisfied in the binary state model of insurance in Example 1;
in Appendix B we provide the details of the derivation of the profit function, the demand curve, and
the cost curves in Proposition 6; in Appendix C we prove that the profit function of the example
in Section 5.2.2 for k > 1 satisfies Assumption 3; in Appendix D we derive the profit function used
in the numerical analysis in Section 8.2 for k < 1.

where the inequality follows from the concavity of u(·) and the equality follows from the fact that

where the last equality follows from the rearrangement of consumers’ indi↵erence condition.
Last, we show that @v/@ > 0 holds for CRRA and CARA utility function when x = 1. For
CARA utility function (i.e., u(c; ) = e c ), consumer’s indi↵erence condition can be simplified
as,
e v = me ! + (1 m).
Carrying out the algebra and solving for v yields,

Assumption 3 is Satisfied in the Example in Section 5.2.2 for k > 1

In this example, v (m, ); x = 0 and v((m, ); x) = k + 1. It can be verified that ⇡(p) is
single-peaked in p for p 2 [0, k + 1]. Moreover, p⇤ 2 (0, 1), pm 2 (1, k) and ⇡ 0 (pm ) = 0.

Therefore, ⇡(p; µ) is strictly increasing

@⇡(p;µ)

⇡(p; µ) is strictly decreasing in p for p 2 [p⇤ , 1).

Therefore, @p
