Can Financial Incentives Help People Trying to Establish New Habits? Experimental Evidence
with New Gym Members

NBER Working Paper No. 23567
July 2017
JEL No. C93,D03,I12
ABSTRACT
We conducted a randomized controlled trial testing the effect of modest incentives to attend the
gym among new members of a fitness facility, a population that is already engaged in trying to
change a health behavior. Our experiment randomized 836 new members of a private gym into a
control group, receiving a $30 payment unconditionally, or one of 3 incentive groups, receiving a
payment if they attended the gym at least 9 times over their first 6 weeks as members. The
incentives were a $30 payment, a $60 payment, and an item costing $30 that leveraged the
endowment effect. These incentives had only moderate impacts on attendance during members’
first 6 weeks and no effect on their subsequent visit trajectories. We document substantial
overconfidence among new members about their likely visit rates and discuss how
overconfidence may undermine the effectiveness of a modest incentive program.

Exercise is a prototypical example of a positive health behavior where self-control
problems appear to lead to suboptimal establishment of habits. Only 21% of Americans get the
recommended amount of weekly exercise 1 and many people feel they exercise less than would
be optimal (e.g., Royer, Stehr and Sydnor, 2015). Many also pay substantial fees over long
periods for gym memberships that they do not use (DellaVigna and Malmendier, 2006).
A small recent literature has used randomized-controlled trials to test whether
temporary financial incentives for exercising can help people establish more lasting habits.
While the literature has identified that temporary incentives for going to the gym have impacts
in some cases (especially Charness and Gneezy, 2009), the effects tend to be modest and do
not always appear (Charness and Gneezy, 2009; Acland and Levy 2015; Royer, Stehr and
Sydnor, 2015; Carrera et al., 2017; Rohde and Verbeke, 2017).
Financial incentives may be less effective when they target a broad population whose
potential for habit formation is not at its peak. Behavior change that leads to successful habit
formation may require that people are motivated and prepared for making a change (Ajzen,
1985). Recent research finds, for example, that many people start new exercise routines and
make other life changes on salient dates, such as birthdays (Dai, Milkman, and Riis, 2014). That
pattern suggests that it may be advantageous to attempt behavior change on specific dates
when motivation might be high. Perhaps, then, timing incentive programs to coincide with
moments when people have already taken the first step toward establishing a new habit could
be more effective. On the other hand, however, people who are attempting to establish new
habits may generally be overoptimistic and facing other adjustment challenges that may
overwhelm any effects of extrinsic incentives.
We test the effects of financial incentives that coincide with endogenous attempts at
establishing new habits using a randomized controlled trial with new members of a gym. This is
a useful group to study in this context because they have all already engaged in costly actions –
paying membership fees and going through the enrollment process – that signal an intention to
use the gym. Prior research also shows clearly that many people who join gyms fail to establish
a gym-going habit. These patterns of attendance are clear amongst our study population. New

members of the gym report that they plan to attend the gym 3 times per week. In reality, in
absence of an intervention, visits initially start at 2 visits per week in the first week and fall
quickly to an average of only 1 visit per week by the end of the second month of membership.
Thus, both the fact that new members have shown that they are ripe for pursuing behavioral
change and the fact that they often face difficulty in establishing and maintaining their exercise
habits make this population an interesting and potentially fruitful one to study.
Our experiment randomized all 836 new members who enrolled in a gym over the
course of an 8 month period into one of four arms: a control group and 3 incentive groups. For
all of the incentive groups, subjects earned incentives by attending the gym at least 9 times in
the first 6 weeks of membership (i.e., an average of 1.5 visits per week). We chose 9 visits as
the target because it was the median number of visits for members who joined prior to our
intervention. The median seemed appropriate because it was high enough to be potentially
motivating for many members yet not so high as to be unrealistic. Among the incentive groups,
subjects in one group earned $30 in an Amazon.com gift card for reaching the threshold,
subjects in one group similarly earned $60 in an Amazon.com gift card, and subjects in the last
group earned a specific but subject-chosen item sold by Amazon.com worth approximately $30.
Research on the endowment effect (Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler, 1990) inspired this itembased incentive. We hypothesized that selecting a specific item at the outset might create a
sense of ownership for that item so that not hitting the target visit rate might feel like a “loss”
of the item. For loss-averse people, that could make an incentive based on an item more
powerful than an equivalent-valued monetary prize, even though the monetary prize is more
fungible.
Our experiment reveals that additional incentives for visits early during a new gym
membership were only moderately effective at helping people to increase their exercise. Across
all of the incentive treatments we find only small effects on the number of visits over the first 6
weeks of membership and no effect of having an incentive on visit rates after that incentive
period. We find that the item incentive induces slightly more visits than the equivalent-valued
monetary incentive, but the differences are modest and not statistically significant. In
heterogeneity analysis, not surprisingly, low exercisers and those who struggle with establishing
3

exercise habits had the largest increases in total visits in response to the incentives. Overall we
conclude that the provision of modest additional financial incentives only marginally changed
the behavior of new gym members.
2.

Experimental Design

2.1

Setting
Our experiment took place at a commercial gym consisting of roughly 3,000 members in

a large Midwestern city between September 2015 and April 2016. The gym is affiliated with a
local nearby university but is open to the public and is separate from the campus’ primary
student fitness facility. In our study sample, 49 percent are associated with the University in
some way as faculty, staff, or students. The baseline membership cost is $59 per month.
However, membership discounts are available to a number of groups including those associated
with the university.
The operation of the facility is rather typical for a fitness gym. The gym is open 7 days
per week from 5:30 a.m. to 12:30 a.m. on weekdays and 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. on the weekend.
Members have an ID card that is swiped by front desk personnel upon entry to the facility.
These timestamped entry records form the primary data for this study. 2
We do not track the specific activities people engaged in while at the gym, only the
number of days they came to the gym and checked in. One potential concern with login records
as the outcome measure for an incentive is that it may encourage people to show up at the
gym only to “swipe in” but not to exercise in their normal way. In general, we were not overly
worried about inducing this type of behavior because there are real costs (e.g., time, parking)
associated with accessing the gym for most people, which tend to reduce the likelihood of this
type of behavior. We also introduced a new checkout procedure partway through the study (in
February 2016). Participants after that time were required to swipe out after attending the gym
for at least 10 minutes in order to get credit for a visit toward their incentive. Introducing this
procedure did not change visit patterns or the estimated treatment effects in the study and the
2

In the event that a member forgets her ID card, the staff will look her up in the computer to log the entry, which
still appears in the same timestamped records.

4

swipe-out records reveal that the vast majority of gym visits lasted substantially longer than 10
minutes.
2.2

Recruitment and treatment assignment
Our subject pool is new members. Upon enrolling with the gym, members fill out a

membership packet. We embedded our experimental randomization into this enrollment
process by attaching our study enrollment forms at the end of each new membership packet
during the study period (see Appendix for a copy of study enrollment forms). The enrollment
forms began with a flyer highlighting their randomized treatment assignment. 3 We used a
simple randomization procedure where enrollment forms were sorted in a stack that alternated
control and each of the three treatment assignments. Gym staff simply used the enrollment
packet on the top of the stack as new members joined the gym. 4
The enrollment forms included an IRB-approved consent form, short survey, and contact
information sheet. Subjects had to consent to participate in the study in order to receive
payment. From the membership packets, there was a record of the treatment offered and
whether or not the new member chose to participate in our study. For those who consented to
participate, we can match at the individual-level their survey data from the enrollment packet
and their gym attendance record. In principle, if new members did not selectively choose
whether to participate, our analysis of consenters (or what we later refer to as participants) is
sufficient and will lead to unbiased estimates of the treatment effects on the treated. However,
we want to test whether this assumption of non-selectivity is true. From the gym, we obtain
two useful data: a) the fraction of consenters across the four arms of the study and b) the
average rate of attendance for each of the four arms unconditional on consenting to participate
(since the gym keeps visit data for all members).
We randomized members into one of four groups. These groups were as follows:

3

For example, for the $30 incentive group, the flyer included “You will be eligible for a $30 Amazon.com gift card”
and “You get the gift card as long as you visit [the gym] on at least 9 days over your first 6 weeks as a member.”
4
There are three membership types at the gym – regular, graduate student, and those who signed up through a
well-being improvement company affiliated with their health insurance plan. We randomized treatment
assignments within stacks of membership forms for these three groups separately. As such, our randomization is
stratified by membership type.

5

(a)

Control group: received a $30 Amazon gift card after six weeks unconditionally.

(b)

Money $30 group: received a $30 Amazon gift card if attended gym at least 9

days in their first 6 weeks of membership.
(c)

Money $60 group: received $60 Amazon gift card if attended gym at least 9 days

in their first 6 weeks of membership.
(d)

Item group: received a self-chosen item worth approximately $30 from Amazon

if attended gym at least 9 days in their first 6 weeks of membership.
For Money $30, Money $60, and Item groups, the receipt of their prize was conditional
on their attendance. The control group received a $30 payment simply for participation (e.g.,
enrollment survey completion), which ensured that any observed effects of the incentive were
not caused by differential “good-will” effects between the treatment groups and control.
Providing a payment to the control group also ensured similar participation rates in the full
study (e.g., consenting to complete the initial survey). 5
Those randomized into the Item group were given the choice of one item among ten
pre-selected products sold on Amazon for roughly $30. At the time of enrollment, we presented
participants with the details of each of the products, including pictures and ratings of them. At
that time, subjects were asked to select one of the products as a prize and were told (truthfully)
that the product would be ordered and held for them until they completed their 6th week of
membership. Of course, the actual receipt of the prize was conditional on attending the gym at
least 9 days over those 6 weeks. One of the item sheets is displayed in the Appendix. 6
Our selection process for these 10 products started with collecting a long list of products
available at Amazon.com for prices ranging $27-35 since prices fluctuate frequently on Amazon,
with at least 100 reviews and an average star rating of at least 4. We then did extensive polling
5

We cannot rule out the possibility that the unconditional payment of a $30 gift card affected the behavior of our
control group and that our incentives would have appeared to have larger effects when compared to a control
group that did not receive any payment. Prior studies, however, have not found that the effects of a gym incentive
depend on whether the control group is uncompensated or receives an unconditional reward (Charness and
Gneezy, 2009, Rohde and Verbeke, 2017)
6
Item group subjects had a choice over the following products: Ninja Master Prep blender (36%), Play X Earbuds
(25%), Bluetooth Shower Speaker (9%), Portable 8W Solar Charger (8.4%), a portable hammock (7.8%), an electric
kettle (6.6%), wireless desktop keyboard/mouse combination (3%), Google Chromecast (1.8%), Redragon gaming
mouse (1.8%) where the numbers in parentheses represent the frequency with which those items were chosen.

on Mechanical Turk to choose the items that generated the most interest as potential prizes for
a study. In the end, the average price paid per item was $31.53.
Classical economic theory predicts that this type of item incentive would be perceived
as (weakly) less valuable than an unconstrained monetary prize of the same value. The
motivation for this incentive design is the endowment effect (Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler,
1990), a phenomenon where people appear to value objects much more if they feel a sense of
ownership for them. The idea in our context was that if individuals felt strong attachment to
their chosen item, this incentive may work better than a monetary incentive with the same
value. We tried to instill a sense of ownership at the beginning of the experiment by emailing
subjects a picture of their item twice: once to confirm their choice of item and its order, and
again after it had arrived, using a Post-It note to label it with their name and telling them that
their item was waiting for them at the gym (all of which was true). Contrasting the Item group
with the Money $30 group and Money $60 group allows us to place a monetary value on the
endowment effect.
2.3

Summary statistics
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the full sample of new members who joined

the gym during our study period. The first two columns show the overall mean and the control
group means for several key variables – first, the participation rate (the fraction of individuals
consenting to be a part of our study) and second, variables collected by the gym for all
members. The next three columns show the difference between the control group and each of
the three treatment groups. The final column presents p-values testing whether each of the
treatment assignments have equal means.7
Nearly all new members consented and were eligible to participate in the study (over
80%). There are slight differences in participation rates across the experimental arms but we
are unable to reject that the participation probability is the same across the treatments.
Approximately half of the new members are associated with the nearby university and nearly
7

These p-values come from tests of equivalence of the treatment dummy coefficients in OLS regressions of each of
the variables listed in the far right column of Table 1 on the treatment status indicators. All models are estimated
with heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors.

7

all of those who are university affiliated are students. Our randomization appears to be
balanced as none of the p-values in the final column indicate statistically significant differences
by treatment status.
Although the packets were distributed in equal numbers, there was some random
variation in final sample sizes for the treatment assignments caused by some packets being
given to potential members who never joined, or to ineligible members (e.g., existing members
completing enrollment forms to change their membership type).
Table 2 parallels Table 1 but lists characteristics for those who consented to participate
in the study, and for whom we have survey measures from the new membership packets.
Across all measures, at standard significance levels, we cannot reject that the means are the
same across treatment groups, suggesting that the treatment groups were balanced. The
average age of participants in the study was 35, similar to the overall sample of new members,
and similar across treatment groups. Compared to the full sample of new members,
participants were slightly more likely to be female (58% vs 55%). Among the participants, we
observe that those in the item group were 7 percentage points less likely than control to be
female, a slight gender imbalance. Overall nearly 90% of participants report having a college
degree or an advanced graduate degree. The high education rates of our sample are consistent
with the gym’s target population of university staff, faculty, graduate students and hospital
employees.
The new membership packet survey also asked participants to report some basic
information about their past exercise behavior and their expectations for visit patterns at the
gym. When respondents answered the survey they were already aware of their treatment
assignment, and as such the answers to these questions could be influenced by treatment
expectations. Overall 43% of participants reported that they had exercised on average one day
or less per week over the prior year. The frequency of reporting low prior-year exercise was
higher for participants in the incentivized treatment groups relative to the control group. We
also asked participants to characterize their past experience establishing an exercise routine.
Subjects could choose from 5 statements the one that best characterized their experience and

8

three of these indicated a failure to establish an ongoing exercise habit in the past. 8 The
majority (55%) of subjects chose one of these three options. Consistent with the patterns for
exercise frequency, those in the treatment groups were a little more likely than control to state
they did not have a prior exercise routine.
The new members expected to attend regularly. On average, new members predicted
that they would visit the gym 3 times per week. Interestingly, that expectation was not
significantly different for those in the incentive groups even though they were aware of the
incentive opportunity. New members were also overall quite confident that they would visit the
gym at least 9 times over their first 6 weeks as members. Participants assessed their likelihood
of attending at least 9 times and using their responses we estimate that overall members
believed they had around a 78% chance of meeting the 9 visit-per-week target. 9 Again,
interestingly, this was similar for those in the treatment and control groups.
3. Results
3.1 Results for participants
We begin our analysis by examining the patterns of visit rates over the first 14 weeks of
membership for the 690 new members who participated in the study. Figure 1a shows these
patterns for the control group and the three incentive groups pooled together.
The most glaring pattern is the downward trend in visits over time for new members.
This highlights why an intervention aiming to encourage members to come frequently or
consistently might be useful. Eight weeks into their membership, new members go half as
frequently as they did in the first week of their membership. The dashed line reveals that the
control group visit rates fell from an average of 2 visits during the first week of membership to
around 1 visit per week by the end of the second month of membership. Recall that members

8

The specific options were: “I have never tried to establish an exercise routine” (10%); “I have repeatedly tried to
establish an exercise routine, but have never been successful” (10%); “I have at times established a regular
exercise routine, but have been unable to stick to it for long periods” (35%); “Although I struggle with my
commitment occasionally, I am usually able to keep up a regular exercise routine” (34%) and “I am a workout buff:
I keep a regular exercise routine without much problem at all” (11%).
9
The survey question appears in the appendix. We assigned 10%, 30%, 50%, 70% and 90% to those responding 020%, 21-40%, 41-60%, 61-80% and 81-100% respectively.

9

expected themselves to make about 3 visits per week, suggesting that without added
incentives, they attended about one third as often as they desired by two months after joining.
The average visit rates for the members assigned to one of the three incentive groups
were somewhat higher over the first 6 weeks of membership, consistent with the presence of
incentives. The differences, however, were quite modest. On average, across the first six weeks,
the members assigned to the incentive treatments made 0.14 more visits per week than the
control group. The largest difference was in week 2 when the control group made an average of
1.5 visits while the incentivized groups averaged 1.73 visits. Interestingly, there was a modest
bump in visit rates for the incentivized group in the 6th week of membership, which was the last
week during which this group could make visits to count toward the 9 visit incentive threshold.
From week 10 on, the average visit rates for the incentivized groups and control groups were
very similar and hover around 1 visit per week.
Figure 1b shows these patterns separately for each of the three incentive groups. The
patterns look generally similar. In all cases we see the same sort of sharp decline in attendance
rates over the first two months of membership. The average visit rates for the Item group were
higher than those of control in all but week 10 suggesting that the Item incentive might have
had a larger effect on attendance than the other incentives. However, caution is warranted in
interpreting these raw visit differentials, as the modest selection patterns identified in Tables 1
and 2 could be partly responsible for these results. Below we present regression results to
quantify the difference in visit rates and to control for the modest differences in observables
between subjects in the different treatments.
It is not obvious that the average number of visits measure examined in Figures 1a and
1b is the most relevant since the incentives were threshold-based and the number of visits
distribution has a non-negligible and long right tail. Thus, it is useful to analyze the distribution
of the number of visits made over the first 6 weeks. Figure 2 shows histograms with the number
of visits top-coded at 24 (average 4 per week) due to the long and sparse right tail in visit
counts. The dashed line in each graph denotes the 9-visit incentive target.
The histograms reveal a few interesting patterns. For all groups, there is considerable
diversity in the number of visits new members make during the first 6 weeks, but in general
10

most of the mass lies below 12 visits (i.e., 2 visits per week on average). For the Control group
the highest peaks in the histogram occur between 2 and 7 visits, and the overall average is 9.41.
The Item incentive group’s visits were shifted slightly to the right with an overall average of
10.75. A two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test of the difference of the two distributions has a pvalue of 0.09.
Both of the monetary incentives, but especially the Money60 treatment, show some
evidence of “hollowing out,” with both more mass at visit rates above 9 and below 3 than the
control. For the Money60 incentive there is a distinct peak in the histogram at 10 visits in the
first 6 weeks and hollowing out of the mass around 7 visits relative to what we see for the
control group. However, the average visits for the Money30 and Money60 treatments were
only modestly higher than the Control average at 9.99 and 10.09, respectively. This is because
the increased fraction attending 9 or 10 times was offset by a higher fraction of members in the
monetary groups who visited only once during the incentive period. One possible interpretation
of this “hollowing out” pattern for the Money60 incentive is that the higher monetary
treatment might have led to some discouragement among a subset of new members and
caused them to give up attending earlier. We caution, however, that overall we cannot detect
statistically significant differences in these distributions: the p-values on the Wilcoxon rank-sum
test of the difference of distributions between Control vs. Money30 and Control vs. Money60
are 0.83 and 0.41, respectively.
In Table 3 we present regression results to quantify the average treatment effects
observed in Figures 1 and 2. For these regressions we run models of the form:
𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖′ 𝜃𝜃 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖 ,

where 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 is a measure of visits and 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 is an indicator that takes the value of 1 for

individuals in the treatment group and 0 otherwise. In Panel A, we present regressions pooling
all three incentive treatments together to estimate a single treatment effect. In Panel B, we
estimate three separate treatment coefficients, one for each of the treatment groups relative
to control. The three visit measures used as dependent variables are a dummy variable for
meeting the 9-visit threshold over the first 6 weeks, the number of visits in the first 6 weeks,

11

and the number of visits in weeks 7-12 (a test of the lasting effects of the intervention, an
interest in prior literature (Charness and Gneezy, 2009 and Royer, Stehr, and Sydnor, 2015)).
We consider models with and without controls. In principle, such controls are not
necessary due to the randomization of the treatments, but in some cases, there are slight
differences in these covariate means across groups, so for robustness, we also include these
control variables. Qualitatively, the addition of the control variables has little impact on
treatment effect point estimates. The matrix of controls, which we include in even-numbered
columns in both tables, includes age in years, an indicator for being female, having a university
affiliation, dummies for special membership type (e.g., student, senior), and indicators for selfreported frequency of exercise in the year prior to joining the gym and for reporting no success
establishing an exercise routine in the past. Throughout we run ordinary least squares
regressions with heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors.
The coefficient estimates in columns 1 and 2 of Table 3, Panel A, show that members
facing an incentive were 9-10 percentage points more likely to reach the threshold of nine visits
in the first six weeks than control group subjects. This result is statistically significant and
substantial relative to the control group’s 48 percent probability of meeting the threshold. The
increase in the average number of visits, however, is less pronounced and only marginally
statistically significant with controls. In column 3, without controls, the estimated increase of
0.85 visits over the first six weeks is equivalent to the sum of the differences between the
dashed and dotted lines, over weeks 1 to 6, in Figure 1a. When controls are added, the
estimated treatment effect increases slightly, to 0.98, and is significant at the 10% level.
Columns 5 and 6 show that in the post-incentive period, weeks 7-12, the estimated difference
in visits between the pooled incentive and control groups is smaller and not statistically
significant, in line with the convergence of the dashed and solid lines seen in Figure 1a. 10
Panel B presents the same regression estimates for each treatment group separately. Of
the three incentive groups, Money 60 had the largest and most significant increase in the
10

Our study was not powered to detect small post-intervention treatment effects. Our power calculations, based
on the visit data of new members prior to our study, implied that with at least 150 participants in each group, we
would have power to detect differences of 1.72 visits over the 6 week intervention period between two groups, or
a 0.29 difference in average visits per week. Note that this minimum detectable difference is less than half as large
as the effect on average weekly visits estimated by Charness and Gneezy (2009), for a threshold incentive of $100.

12

probability of meeting the 9 visit threshold, a 12 percentage point increase. This is not
surprising since members of this group had the strongest incentive to meet the threshold. It is
more surprising, however, that Money 60 also had the smallest increase in average visit rates
after controlling for covariates. This reflects the apparent “discouragement effects” seen in
Figure 2. Compared to the distribution of visits in the control group, the $60 incentive has more
mass just above the threshold of nine visits, but also more mass far below the threshold, with
the latter potentially representing people who visited less than they would have in the absence
of the incentive. Thus, the average visit rate is only slightly larger in Money 60 versus the
control group, despite a substantial increase in the probability of being above the threshold.
The estimated treatment effects of Item and Money30 are positive but statistically
insignificant. Examining the point estimates across the different specifications, it is not
immediately clear whether the Item or Money30 treatment is more effective. Recall that our
goal in including these two treatments was to test for the endowment effect. Classical
economic theory would predict that a fungible $30 is a weakly stronger incentive than a fixed
item worth $30, but if the anticipation of owning a chosen item evokes “the endowment
effect,” then the Item treatment may have a stronger effect. All of these coefficients, however,
are statistically insignificant at the 5% level, and only the effect of Item on 9+ visits is significant
at the 10% level. The magnitude of Item treatment effect on 9+ visits is not negligible - nearly a
20% increase in the probability of attending 9 or more days.
3.2 Robustness check using assignment to treatment offer
Since our study enrollment packets contained information about incentives, individuals
in the recruitment pool could learn about their assigned treatments before deciding whether to
participate. In Table 1, we showed that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that treatment
status had no effect on participation rates. Nonetheless, in this section we address the possible
concern of differential selection by treatment group by conducting a simple intent-to-treat
analysis.
While we do not have survey data for those who did not participate, our agreement
with the gym does allow us to calculate visit rates for the full sample of new members. We can
13

compute visit outcomes for all members invited to participate and test for mean differences
between the groups offered different treatments.
Table 4 summarizes visit outcomes for all who were invited to participate in the study,
by their assigned treatment group or “treatment offer.” The differences reported between each
group and the control group are “intent to treat” effects. These synthesize the same
information we present in Table 3 except we present means and differences in means. The
second panel shows the means of each visit outcome when all treatments are pooled into a
single incentive group. The means for 9+ visits and visits over 1st 6 weeks are larger than the
means of the control group, showing a marginally significant 0.07 percent increase in meeting
the 9-visit threshold and an insignificant increase of 0.57 in average visits among new members
who were invited to join an incentive group relative to those invited to the control group. It is
not surprising that these impacts are smaller than the analogous estimates in Table 3 because
the treatments should have little effect on the non-participants – leading to a dampened effect
overall when we combine participants and non-participants. The remaining panels of Table 4
show means by specific treatment group. The differences among the treatment groups follow
the same patterns seen in columns 1, 3, and 5 of Table 3, Panel B and discussed in the previous
section. This analysis is less powerful given the non-participant rates but is consistent with our
earlier analysis and further indicates that the main results are not driven by selection.
3.3 Heterogeneity
The overall effects presented thus far may mask interesting and substantial
heterogeneity – especially given the diversity in the new member population. In this light, we
investigate whether the treatment effects among participants differ by survey measures of
exercise frequency and familiarity with maintaining an exercise routine. A threshold incentive
might work better for those with low levels of exercise and little experience maintaining an
exercise routine since these groups presumably have more scope for improvement in their
exercise habits. Alternatively, if the goal is not realistic, then a threshold incentive may work
better for those with higher levels of exercise and more experience maintaining a routine,

14

particularly if their exercise level in the absence of the incentive was close to but did not exceed
the threshold.
Table 5 presents the results of heterogeneity cuts along these lines. We define as low
exercisers those who reported exercising one or fewer times per week in the year before
joining the gym and high exercisers as those who reported exercising two or more times per
week. We categorize individuals as unsuccessful in maintaining an exercise routine if they
report on our survey that they have never tried to establish an exercise routine, have been
unsuccessful in trying to establish an exercise routine, or have been unable to sustain an
exercise routine for a long period of time. We categorize individuals as successful if they are
usually able to maintain an exercise routine or do so without much trouble.
Overall we do not detect substantial heterogeneity in the treatment effects by these
cuts. However, we are limited in power to detect differences across the groups. The incentive
effect point estimates on encouraging people to exceed the 9-visit threshold are elevated for
those with more successful previous exercise routines, which may reflect the fact that this
group was more likely to be near that threshold to begin with. The effects on average visit rates
during and after the intervention, though, are higher for low exercisers and those with less
prior success with exercise.
4. Discussion and Conclusion
We conclude that the provision of moderately-sized financial incentives only moderately
helped new gym members establish better habits for using the gym. This suggests that, at least
for exercise, timing financial incentives to align with endogenous attempts at behavior change
may not be the most successful strategy for improving exercise habits.
One question raised by our results is whether the small effects of our incentives are
related to their size and threshold nature. The results here do not rule out that a different type
of incentive structure, like a per-visit incentive, or higher incentive stakes, might have
generated stronger behavior change. However, two prior gym incentive studies, Charness and
Gneezy (2009) and Acland and Levy (2015), documented substantial average response to
threshold-based incentives and even saw some lasting effects on attendance once the
15

incentives were removed. 11 So, ex ante, there was no reason to expect that a threshold
incentive would be ineffective amongst our study population. The incentive stakes we used in
this experiment, though, are smaller than those in previous studies, with our $60 treatment
offering stakes around half the size of those in Charness and Gneezy (2009). 12

Also, our

“monetary” treatments offered Amazon gift cards rather than cash, which might make them
slightly less valuable to some participants. 13 It is possible that doubling the size of our larger
incentive might have had a more substantial impact on behavior. However, linearly
extrapolating from the comparison of our $30 and $60 treatments, we might expect some
increase in the probability of hitting the 9-visit threshold (a 20 percentage point treatment
effect as compared to the 12 percentage point effect seen earlier) if we doubled the size of the
largest incentive to $120, but no increase in the impact on overall visits, since the point
estimate for the $60 treatment on visits is smaller than that for the $30 treatment. What we
can say clearly is the promise of moderately-sized incentives in helping people establish
exercise habits is limited. Modest-sized incentives (as opposed to high-powered incentives) are
relevant when considering broad interventions, and are of the size firms and gyms often use.
Our results offer some interesting insights on our population of new members. New
members are extremely overoptimistic about how often they will visit the gym, and there is a
fast decline in their visit frequency over the first few months of membership. In our survey, 95
percent of participants indicated that they expected to visit the gym more than once per week
on average, but the share of participants who did so was 63 percent in the first month and
dropped to 34 percent in the third month. We also observe substantial dispersion in earlymembership visit patterns. While some in the control group reach the 9 visit threshold as early
as their second week, 14 percent don’t come at all in weeks 2-4, and 28 percent make less than
11

Among studies focusing on incentives for health behaviors and outcomes, some use threshold-based incentives
(e.g., Acland and Levy, 2015; Babcock and Hartman, 2010; Babcock et al., 2015; Charness and Gneezy, 2009; John
et al., 2011;, Rohde and Verbeke, 2017; Volpp et al., 2008; and Volpp et al., 2009) and some use more continuousbased incentives (e.g., Carrera et al., 2017, Cawley and Price, 2013; and Royer, Stehr, Sydnor, 2015).
12
Charness and Gneezy’s Study 1 offered participants $100 for attending the gym 8 times over 4 weeks compared
to our incentive treatment of $60 for 9 visits over 6 weeks.
13
The survey included a question “How often do you shop on Amazon.com?” The majority, 54% of respondents,
chose “Frequently,” 39% chose “Occasionally,” and only 6.7% chose “Never or very rarely.” Also, even our smaller
gift card, $30, was enough to meet Amazon’s minimum spending to obtain free shipping. Thus, we are not too
concerned that participants would value the gift cards at less than their nominal value.

16

one visit per week, on average, in the first month. 14 Our incentives changes this distribution of
visits only in a very localized way, inducing those just below the threshold to make a few extra
visits over the six weeks but not raising average visit rates significantly.
One of the takeaways from this study is that future interventions aimed at closing the
gap between intended and actual behavior among new members may need to be based on a
better understanding of both their overconfidence and the rapid decline of their visit rate. For
example, those who attended very infrequently over their first months of membership believed
at the start that they were very likely to visit often and did not believe that their likelihood of
visiting often would be influenced by the incentive.15 That pattern is consistent with the
possibility that overoptimistic people derive little additional motivation during the beginning of
incentive programs because they (wrongly) believe they are very likely to earn the incentives.
Ultimately, we believe these results suggest that simply timing incentives to coincide
with intrinsic motivation for change is likely to be insufficient on its own to help people reach
their health goals. Even amongst new members, there is substantial heterogeneity in their past
exercise habits. Instead of focusing on this group as a whole, it may be better to find ways to
tailor incentives so that they are providing motivation on the margin for each individual.
Moreover, tackling individuals’ overconfidence by helping individuals set realistic and
reasonable goals for themselves may make incentive programs more effective. In general,
tailoring incentives is challenging, but in a population that has just started trying to change their
own behavior, it may be more fruitful to add an extrinsic incentive after a short delay, or to
design an adaptive incentive that adjusts based on the patterns of early success or failure
observed. We see these as promising avenues for future research.

14

This dispersion, which we anticipated when designing this experiment, highlights one reason why we chose a
threshold as opposed to a per-visit incentive: Per-visit incentives result in the bulk of the budget being used to
reward people who would be frequently visiting the gym anyway.
15
Their perceived probabilities of making 9+ visits, reported in the initial survey after learning their treatment
assignments, did not differ significantly between the treatment and control groups. (Average perceived
probabilities imputed from a five-point scale ranged from 77.7% in the control group to 79.9% in the item group).
