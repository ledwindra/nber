    "abstract": "\n\nWe propose a new inverse probability weighting (IPW) estimator for moment condition models with missing data. Our estimator is easy to implement and compares favorably with existing IPW estimators, including augmented inverse probability weighting (AIPW) estimators, in terms of efficiency, robustness, and higher order bias. We illustrate our method with a study of the relationship between early Black-White differences in cognitive achievement and subsequent differences in adult earnings. In our dataset the early childhood achievement measure, the main regressor of interest, is missing for many units.\n\n",

This is a heavily revised and extended version of NBER Working Paper w13981 titled \"Inverse probability tilting and missing data problems\". Previous versions of this paper also circulated under the title \"A new method of estimating moment condition models with missing data when selection is on observables.\" Material in Section 4 of the initial NBER paper is not included in this version of the paper, but may be found in the companion paper \"Efficient estimation of data combination problems by the method of auxiliary-to-study tilting\" (NBER Working Paper w16928 ).
