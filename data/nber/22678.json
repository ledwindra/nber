I establish this stylized fact with meta-analysis and confirm it by estimating a plain-vanilla gravity model.  I then explain this finding by examining systematic biases in \u201cmultilateral resistance to trade\u201d manifest in time-varying country fixed effects; bias grows as the sample is truncated by dropping small poor countries.\n\n",
