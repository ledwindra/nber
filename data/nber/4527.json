First, we review the implications of neoclassical growth theory and the more recent theories of 'endogenous growth'.  Then we discuss the empirical evidence that bears on the modeling of long-run growth.  Finally, we describe in more detail a model of growth based on endogenous technological progress and discuss the lessons that such models can teach us.\n\n",
