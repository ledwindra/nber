                                        1    Introduction

Figure 1 plots income per worker relative to the the world average in 1990 against its
1960 value, and draws the 45 degree line for comparison. This picture of the world
income distribution raises two questions: First, why are there such large di®erences in
income across countries? For example, some countries, such as the U.S. or Canada, are
30 times as rich as others such as Mali or Uganda. Second, why has the world income
distribution been relatively stable since 1960? A number of growth miracles and disasters
notwithstanding, the dispersion of income has not changed much over this period: most
observations are around the 45 degree line and the standard deviation of income is similar
in 1990 to what it was in 1960 (1.06 vs. .96).1
       Existing frameworks for analyzing these questions are built on two assumptions: (1)
\shared technology" or technological spillovers: all countries share advances in world
technology, albeit with some delay in certain cases; (2) diminishing returns in production:
rates of return to accumulable factors, such as capital, decline as these factors become
more abundant. The most popular model incorporating these two assumptions is the
neoclassical (Solow-Ramsey) growth model. All countries have access to a common tech-
nology, which improves exogenously. Diminishing returns to capital in production pulls all
countries towards the growth rate of the world technology.2 Di®erences in economic poli-
cies, saving rates and technology do not lead to di®erences in long-run growth rates, but
in levels of capital per worker and income. The strength of diminishing returns determines
how a given set of di®erences in these country characteristics translate into di®erences in
capital and income per worker.3
   1
     Among subsets of countries with similar institutional structures there is substantial narrowing of
di®erentials. For example, the standard deviation of log income per worker among OECD economies was
0.53 in 1960 and fell to 0.30 in 1990. In contrast, there appears to be signi¯cant widening of income
di®erentials during the 100 years before 1960. See, for example, Durlauf (1995) and Quah (1997) on
changes in the postwar post-war world income distribution, and Parente and Prescott (1994) and Jones
(1997) on its relative stability. See Pritchett (1997) for the widening of the world income distribution
since 1870.

and Prescott (1994), and Mankiw (1995).

     A di®erent but related story recognizes technology di®erences across countries. Despite these di®er-
ences, backward countries share some of the technological improvements of advanced economies through
spillovers. These spillovers ensure the stability of the world income distribution, and also determine
how di®erences in country characteristics translate into income di®erences. See, for example, Grossman
and Helpman (1991), Parente and Prescott (1994), Coe and Helpman (1995), Howitt (2000), Eaton and


                                                   1
   This paper o®ers an alternative framework for analyzing the world income distribution.
We show that even in the absence of diminishing returns in production and technological
spillovers, international trade leads to a stable world income distribution. Countries that
accumulate capital faster than average experience declining export prices, reducing the
value of the marginal product of capital and discouraging further accumulation at home.
They also increase the demand for products and the value of the marginal product of
capital in the rest of the world, encouraging accumulation there. These terms of trade
e®ects introduce de facto diminishing returns at the country level and ensure the stability
of the world income distribution. Consequently, cross-country di®erences in economic
policies, saving rates and technology lead to di®erences in relative incomes, not in long-
run growth rates. How disperse the world income distribution will be for a given set of
country characteristics is determined by the forces that shape the strength of the terms
of trade e®ects; namely, the degree of openness to international trade and the extent of
specialization.
   Some degree of specialization in production is essential for the terms of trade e®ects
we emphasize here: if domestic and foreign products were perfect substitutes, countries
would be facing °at export demands, and capital accumulation would not a®ect their
terms of trade. That countries specialize in di®erent sets of products appears plausible.
Moreover, this assumption has proved to be crucial in explaining some robust features of
international trade, such as the substantial two-way trade in products of similar factor
intensities and the success of the gravity equation in accounting for bilateral trade °ows.4
   We model the world as a collection of economies a la Rebelo (1991), with growth
resulting from accumulation of capital. In the absence of international trade, countries
grow at di®erent rates determined by their economic policies, saving rates and technology.
With international trade and specialization, the world as a whole still behaves as the
standard Rebelo economy, but now all countries share the same long-run growth rate.
   To understand why countries tend to grow at the same rate and what factors determine
their relative incomes, consider the familiar steady-state condition equating the rate of
return to savings to the e®ective rate of time preference. In our model, this condition
takes the form
                         ³                              ´

The rental rate depends negatively on the relative capital of the country because of terms
of trade e®ects: countries that produce more face lower export prices and a lower value of
the marginal product of capital. This condition also shows how di®erent characteristics
a®ect relative incomes. In the steady state, countries with lower rates of time preference
and lower price of investment goods (those with fewer distortions a®ecting investment)
will have lower rental rates, hence higher relative capital and income. Countries with
better technologies will be richer, in turn, because they have higher rental rates for a
given level of relative capital and income.
   Despite rich interactions across countries, we show in Section 3 that cross-country
income di®erences take a simple form, analogous to the basic Solow-Ramsey model. We
also show that cross-country income di®erences and the rate of conditional convergence
depend on the strength of the terms of trade e®ects, not on the capital share in output
as in the Solow-Ramsey model. For plausible values of the elasticity of export demand
and the share of exports in GDP, the terms of trade e®ects are strong enough to generate
an elasticity of output to capital su±cient to account for observed di®erences in incomes
and the speed of conditional convergence.
   In Section 3 we also provide evidence of terms of trade e®ects. We look at cross-
country growth regressions to isolate di®erences in growth rates due to accumulation. As
emphasized by Barro (1991) and Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995), countries that are poor
relative to their steady state income level accumulate faster. We show that this faster
accumulation is also associated with a worsening in the terms of trade. Our estimates
imply that holding technology and other determinants of steady-state income constant, a
1 percentage point faster growth is associated with a 0.7 percentage point deterioration
in the terms of trade. With terms of trade e®ects of this magnitude, our model explains
a signi¯cant fraction of cross-country income di®erences.
   Our main results are derived in Sections 2 and 3 in a model with capital as the only
factor of production. An implication of this framework is that factor and product prices
are lower in richer countries. We extend our basic setup in Section 4 to include labor as
an additional factor of production. This extended framework implies that wages should
be higher in rich countries and can also account for some stylized facts regarding relative
prices across countries. For example, costs of living are higher and relative prices of
investment goods are lower in rich countries as in the data (see Summers and Heston,
1991, or Figure 2 below). We also demonstrate that the main predictions of the model


                                              3
are independent of the capital share in national product.
       Sections 2, 3, and 4 consider models with exogenous specialization. Would similar
results hold if countries could choose which goods, and how many goods, to produce?
We consider two reasons for specialization; increasing returns in production and costly
product development. We show that in both cases the terms of trade e®ects continue
to operate and ensure a common long-run growth rate across countries. As a byproduct
of this analysis, we also obtain a simple theory of cross-country total factor productivity
di®erences: countries with lower rates of time preference (higher saving rates) have better
technologies, contributing to their higher relative income. Another implication of this
analysis is that whether countries share the same technology frontier or not is not essential
to our results: in the model with increasing returns in production all countries share the
same technology, while in the model with costly product development countries have
di®erent technologies.
       Our study is related to the endogenous growth literature5 and to papers on cross-
country technological spillovers mentioned above. Howitt (2000) is most closely related to
our study. He shows that in a model of Schumpeterian endogenous growth, if innovations
build on a worldwide \leading-edge technology", all countries grow at the same rate, and
policy and saving rate di®erences a®ect relative incomes. Howitt's results are therefore
parallel to ours, but rely on widespread technological spillovers. We emphasize instead
the role of commodity trade and show that even a small amount of commodity trade is
su±cient for all countries to share the same long-run growth rate.
       Our study also relates to the literature on international trade and growth. A ¯rst
strand of the literature emphasizes learning-by-doing, and studies how international trade
changes the industrial structure of countries and a®ects their aggregate rate of productiv-
ity growth.6 A second strand of the literature studies how international trade a®ects the
incentives to innovate.7 A third strand of the literature studies how international trade
a®ects the process of capital accumulation in the presence of some form of factor price
equalization.8 Our paper is closer to this third line of research, since we also examine
   5
      See, for example, Romer (1986, 1990), Lucas (1988), Rebelo (1991), Grossman and Helpman
(1991a,b), Aghion and Howitt (1992). Although we use the formulation of Rebelo with capital accu-
mulation as the engine of growth, our results generalize to a model in which endogenous growth results
from technical change as in these other papers.

the e®ects of international trade on the incentives to accumulate capital. We depart from
earlier papers by focusing on the case without factor price equalization. With factor price
equalization, the rental rate of capital is independent of domestic capital and countries
can accumulate without experiencing diminishing returns. Without factor price equaliza-
tion, the rental rate of capital is determined by the domestic capital stock even in the
absence of technological diminishing returns.

                            2   A World of AK Economies

In this section, we outline a world of AK economies with trade and specialization. The
main purpose of this model is to demonstrate how terms of trade e®ects create a force
towards a common growth rate across countries. We establish that any amount of inter-
national trade ensures that cross-country di®erences in technology, saving and economic
policies translate into di®erences in income levels, not growth rates. Countries that accu-
mulate capital faster than average experience declining export prices, reducing the rate
return to capital and discouraging further accumulation. These terms of trade e®ects
create diminishing returns to capital at the country level and keep the world distribution
stable.

2.1     Description

The world we consider contains a continuum of \small" countries with mass 1. Capital is
the only factor of production. There is a continuum of intermediate products indexed by
z 2 [0; M ], and two ¯nal products that are used for consumption and investment. There
is free trade in intermediate goods and no trade in ¯nal products or assets.
      Countries di®er in their technology, savings and economic policies. In particular, each
country is de¯ned by a triplet (¹; ½; Á), where ¹ is an indicator of how advanced the
technology of the country is, ½ is its rate of time preference, and Á is a measure the e®ect
of policies and institutions on the incentives to invest. We denote the joint distribution
of these characteristics by G(¹; ½; Á) and assume it is time invariant.
      All countries admit a representative consumer with utility function:
                                     Z1
                                          ln c(t) ¢ e¡½¢t ¢ dt ;                         (1)
                                     0

where c(t) is consumption at date t in the (¹; ½; Á)-country. Throughout the paper, we sim-
plify the notation by suppressing time and country indices when this causes no confusion.

                                                  5
The budget constraint facing the representative consumer is

                                     pI ¢ k_ + pC ¢ c = y ´ r ¢ k;                                    (2)

where pI and pC are the prices of the investment and consumption goods, k is capital
stock, and r is the rental rate. For simplicity we assume that capital does not depreciate.
Since there is no international trade in assets, income, y, must equal to consumption,
                              _
pC ¢ c, plus investment, pI ¢ k.
    To introduce specialization, we adopt the Armington assumption that products are
di®erentiated by origin.9 Let ¹ be the number of intermediates produced by the (¹; ½; Á)-
                 R
country, with        ¹ ¢ dG = M . A higher level of ¹ corresponds to the ability to produce
a larger variety of intermediates, so we interpret ¹ as an indicator of how advanced the
technology of the country is. In all countries, intermediates are produced by competitive
¯rms using a technology that requires one unit of capital to produce one intermediate.
    Each country also contains many competitive ¯rms in the consumption and investment
goods sectors with unit cost functions:

where p(z) is the price of the intermediate with index z. These equations state that
the production of consumption and investment goods require the services of domestic
capital and intermediates. The parameter ¿ is the share of intermediates in production
and it will also turn out to be the ratio of exports to income. This ratio is usually
interpreted as a measure of openness. The parameter " is the elasticity of substitution
among the intermediates and also the price-elasticity of foreign demand for the country's
products. The inverse of this elasticity is often interpreted as a measure of the degree of
specialization. We assume that " > 1. This assumption rules out immiserizing growth,
that is, the country becoming poorer despite accumulating more (see Bhagwati, 1958).
Note that the technologies for consumption and investment goods are identical except for
    9
      See Armington (1969). We make this crude assumption to simplify the analysis and highlight the im-
plications of specialization for growth patterns in the simplest way. In Section 5, we model how countries
choose the set of intermediates that they produce and provide micro-foundations for this assumption.

on the incentives to invest. Examples of the policies and institutions we have in mind
include the degree of enforcement of property rights or the distortions created by the tax
code.10

2.2      World Equilibrium

A competitive equilibrium of the world economy consists of a sequence of prices and
quantities such that ¯rms and consumers maximize and markets clear. Our assumptions
ensure that such an equilibrium exists and is unique. We prove this by construction.
       Consumer maximization of (1) subject to (2) yields the following ¯rst-order conditions:
                                        r + p_I   p_C    c_
                                                ¡     =½+ ;                                          (5)
                                          pI      pC     c
                                              pI ¢ k ¡½¢t
                                        lim          ¢e   = 0:                                       (6)
                                        t!1   pC ¢ c
Equation (5) is the standard Euler equation and states that the rate of return to capital,
r + p_I p_C
       ¡ , must equal the rate of time preference plus a correction factor that depends
  pI      pC
on the slope of the consumption path. Equation (6) is the transversality condition. Inte-
grating the budget constraint and using the Euler and transversality conditions, we ¯nd
that the optimal rule is to consume a ¯xed fraction of wealth:

                                          pC ¢ c = ½ ¢ pI ¢ k:                                       (7)

Equation (7) implies that countries with more patient consumers|low ½| will have lower
consumption to capital ratios.
       Next consider ¯rm maximization. The production functions (3) and (4) ensure that
all intermediates are produced in equilibrium. Since ¯rms in the intermediates sector are
competitive, they set their price equal to marginal cost, the rental rate of capital. So the
price of any variety of intermediate produced in the (¹; ½; Á)-country is equal to:

                                                 p = r:                                              (8)
  10
    Jones (1995), Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan (1998) and Parente, Rogerson and Wright (2000) have
emphasized the importance of such policies in explaining cross-country di®erences in income levels, and a
range of empirical studies have shown the importance of institutional di®erences in a®ecting investment
and economic performance (e.g., Knack and Keefer, 1995, Barro, 1997, Hall and Jones, 1999, Acemoglu,
Johnson and Robinson, 2000).


                                                   7
We use the ideal price index for intermediates as the numeraire, i.e.,
                                ZM                    Z
                                     p(z)1¡" ¢ dz =       ¹ ¢ p1¡" ¢ dG = 1:                           (9)
                                0

Since all countries export practically all of their production of intermediates and import
the ideal basket of intermediates, this choice of numeraire implies that p is also the terms
of trade of the country, i.e. the price of exports relative to imports.11
       Firms in the consumption and investment sectors take prices as given and choose factor
inputs to maximize pro¯ts. The logarithmic preferences in (1) ensure that the demand
for consumption goods is always strong enough to induce some production in equilibrium,
so price equals cost:
                                               pC = r1¡¿ :                                            (10)

On the other hand, if the country starts with a large capital stock, consumers may want to
dissave and there may not be any production of investment goods. We rule this possibility
out by assuming that the initial capital stock is not too large. This ensures that price
equals cost for the investment good as well:

                                             pI = Á¡1 ¢ r1¡¿ :                                        (11)

       Finally, we need to impose market clearing for capital. By Walras' law, this is equiv-
alent to imposing trade balance.12 Each country spends a fraction ¿ of its own income
on foreign intermediates, while the rest of the world spends a fraction ¿ ¢ ¹ ¢ p1¡" of their
income on this country's intermediates. Therefore, trade balance requires

                                             y = ¹ ¢ p1¡" ¢ Y:                                        (12)
                R
where Y ´           y ¢ dG is world income. Equation (12) implies that when the number of
varieties, ¹, is larger, a given level of income y is associated with better terms of trade,
  11
     Although each country is small relative to the world, it has market power because of complete
specialization in the production of intermediates. So, each country may want to act as a monopolist,
imposing an optimal tari® or an export tax. Whether they do so or not does not a®ect our results,
and we ignore this possibility. In any case, a cooperative equilibrium with free trade policies is superior
to a non-cooperative equilibrium in which all countries actively use trade policy, so we may think that
countries have solved this coordination problem and have committed not to use trade policy.
  12
     Market clearing for capital implies that k = kn + ¹ ¢ ki , where kn is capital used in the nontraded
sector, and ki is capital used in the production of each intermediate. Given the Cobb Douglas assumption,
we have kn = (1 ¡ ¿ ) ¢ y=r. Also because demand for each intermediate is of the constant elasticity form
and a fraction ¿ of world income Y is spent on intermediates, we have ki = ¿ ¢ p1¡" ¢ Y=p. Using y = r ¢ k,
the market clearing condition for capital is equivalent to (12).

                                                      8
p, and higher rental rate of capital, since r = p. Intuitively, a greater ¹ implies that for a
given level aggregate capital stock, there will be less capital allocated to each variety of
intermediate, so each will command a higher price in the world market. Conversely, for
a given ¹, a greater relative income y=Y translates into lower terms of trade and rental
rate.

2.3     World Dynamics

The state of the world economy is fully described by a distribution of capital stocks. A
law of motion for the world economy consists of a rule to determine the trajectory of this
distribution from any starting position. This law of motion is given by the following pair
of equations for each country:13
                                            k_
                                               = Á ¢ r¿ ¡ ½;                                         (13)
                                            k
                                                         Z
                                    r ¢ k = ¹ ¢ r1¡" ¢       r ¢ k ¢ dG:                             (14)

For a given cross-section of rental rates, the set of equations in (13) determine the evolution
of the distribution of capital stocks. For a given distribution of capital stocks, the set of
equations in (14) determine the cross-section of rental rates.
   The world economy has a unique and stable steady state in which all countries grow at
the same rate.14 To describe this steady state, de¯ne the world growth rate as x ´ Y_ =Y ,
and the relative income of a (¹; ½; Á)-country as yR ´ y=Y . Then, setting the same
                                     _ = y=y
growth rate for all countries, i.e., k=k _ = x, we obtain the steady-state cross-section
of rental rates as                              Ã            !1=¿
                                           ¤        ½ + x¤
                                          r =                                                        (15)
                                                      Á
where \*" is used to denote the steady-state value of a variable; for example, x¤ is the
steady-state world growth rate. Using (8), equation (15) also gives the steady-state terms
of trade of the country, p¤ . It is important to note that in steady state terms of trade and
rental rates are constant. This highlights that the world income distribution is stable not
because of continuously changing terms of trade, but because countries that accumulate
more face lower terms of trade, reducing the interest rate and the incentives for further
  13
     To obtain (13), we substitute the price equations, (7), (8), and (11) into the budget constraint (2).
To obtain (14), we simply rewrite equation (12) using (2) and (8).
  14
     Stability follows immediately since there is a single di®erential equation describing the behavior of
each country given by (13), and this di®erential equation is stable because, from equation (14), a greater
k leads to a lower r.

accumulation. In the steady state, both the distribution of capital stocks and relative
prices are stable.
   Using equations (9), (12) and (15), we can provide a complete characterization of the
world distribution of income in the steady state:
                                              Ã           ! "¡1

                                Z         Ã       ! "¡1

                                       ½ + x¤
Equation (16) describes the steady-state world income distribution and states that rich
countries are those which are patient (low ½), create incentives to invest (high Á), and have
access to better technologies (high ¹). Equation (17) implicitly de¯nes the steady-state
world growth rate and shows that it is higher if countries have \good" characteristics, i.e.,
low values for ½ and high values for Á and ¹.
   International trade and specialization play an essential role in shaping the world in-
come distribution. To see this, use equations (8), (10), (11), and (12) to write the terms
of trade and the rate of return to capital as follows:
                                                          Ã        !    1
                                                              ¹        "¡1
                              terms of trade = p =                           ;           (18)
                                                              yR

                                              r + p_I   p_C
                          rate of return =            ¡     = Á ¢ p¿ :                   (19)
                                                pI      pC
   These are the two key relative prices in our economy. Equation (18) states that for a
given measure of country technology ¹, the terms of trade of the country are decreasing in
its relative income. Intuitively, a greater level of income translates into greater production
for each variety of intermediates in which the country specializes, and this greater supply
reduces the relative prices of these intermediates. Equation (19) states that for given
economic policies Á, the rate of return to capital is increasing in the terms of trade. This
is also intuitive: a higher price for the country's exports raises the value of the marginal
product of capital and hence the rate of return to capital. Equations (18) and (19)
together explain why countries face diminishing returns to capital.
   These equations also illustrate the sources of income di®erences across countries. To
provide incentives for accumulation, the steady-state rate of return to capital must equal
the e®ective rate of time preference, ½ + x¤ . Equation (19) implies that for countries with

                                               10
greater patience and better economic policies, lower terms of trade are su±cient to ensure
accumulation (i.e., to ensure that the rate of return is equal to ½ + x¤ ). Equation (18),
on the other hand, translates lower terms of trade and better technology into a greater
relative income level, yR . So countries with low values for ½ and high values for Á and ¹
will be richer.
   Equations (18) and (19) also give the intuition for the stability of the world income
distribution. A country with a relative income level below its steady-state value has terms
of trade above its steady state (eq. (18)). Terms of trade above steady state in turn
translate into a rate of return to capital that exceeds the e®ective rate of time preference
(eq. (19)). This induces faster accumulation than the rest of the world, increasing relative
income. As this occurs, the terms of trade worsen, the rate of return declines, and the
rate of capital accumulation converges towards the world growth rate.
   As in most growth models, both the shape of the steady-state world income distri-
bution and the speed of convergence towards this steady state depend on the strength
of diminishing returns. While in standard models diminishing returns is postulated as a
property of technology, in our model it is derived from changes in relative prices resulting
from international trade and specialization. Naturally, the strength of diminishing re-
turns depends on the volume of trade and the extent of specialization. There are stronger
diminishing returns when the volume of trade and the extent of specialization are greater
(high ¿ and low "). When ¿ is low, equation (19) shows that the rate of return to capital
is less sensitive to changes in the terms of trade. In the limit, as ¿ ! 0, we converge
to a closed economy, the rate of return is independent of the terms of trade, and there
are no diminishing returns. In this case, as in the standard endogenous growth models,
very small di®erences in country characteristics are su±cient to create arbitrarily large
di®erences in incomes (and also to make the process of convergence to this steady state
arbitrarily slow). Similarly, when " is high, equation (18) shows that terms of trade are
less sensitive to di®erences in relative incomes. In the limit as " ! 1, we are back to the
endogenous growth world.

                     3   Empirical Implications and Evidence

World income has grown steadily during the past 200 years. And over the postwar era, as
suggested by Figure 1, most countries have grown at similar rates. Our model provides a
uni¯ed framework for interpreting these facts. Since there are constant returns to capital


                                            11
accumulation from a global perspective, the time-series behavior of the world economy is
similar to that of existing endogenous growth models. In particular, the world economy
grows at a rate determined by policies, savings and technology. However, since there
are diminishing returns to capital accumulation at the country level, the cross-sectional
behavior of the world economy is similar to that of existing exogenous growth models.
Cross-country variation in economic policies, savings and technologies translate into cross-
country variation in incomes, and country dynamics exhibit conditional convergence as
in the Solow-Ramsey model. We now discuss how our model can be used to interpret
cross-country income di®erences and patterns of conditional convergence, and provide
some evidence of terms of trade e®ects.

3.1   Re-Interpreting Cross-country Income Differences

Recall that in Solow's (1956) model countries save a fraction s of their income, and have
access to technologies subject to diminishing returns. For example, consider the popular
                                                             1¡®
Cobb-Douglas aggregate production function: y = (A ¢ ex¢t )        ¢ k ® , where A is a country-
speci¯c e±ciency parameter, x is the exogenous rate of technological progress, and ® is
the share of capital in national product. A key assumption of this framework is that
technology improves at the same rate everywhere, hence x is common across countries.
As usual, de¯ne income per e®ective worker as y^ = y ¢ e¡x¢t . Then, steady-state income
is:
                                             µ ¶   ®
                                      ¤    s 1¡®
                                 y^ = A ¢        :                            (20)
                                           x
So countries that save more (high s) and are more e±cient (high A) have higher per
capita incomes, though all countries share the same growth rate x. The responsiveness
of income to savings depends on the capital share, ®. Mankiw, Romer and Weil (1992)
estimated a version of equation (20) and found that it provides a reasonable ¯t to cross-
country di®erences in income for ® 2 [2=3; 4=5]. Similarly, Klenow and Rodriguez (1997)
and Hall and Jones (1999) show that given the range of variation in capital-output ratios
and education across countries, the Solow model accounts for the observed di®erences in
income per capita without large di®erences in the productivity term A if ® 2 [2=3; 4=5].
This implies a quali¯ed success for the Solow model: given the share of capital in national
product of approximately 1=3 as in OECD economies, the framework accounts for cross-
country income di®erences only if there are sizable di®erences in productivity or e±ciency


                                            12
(the A term).
   To relate these empirical ¯ndings to our model, note that our key equation (16) is in
                                                                             x¤ 15
e®ect identical to (20); in our model the steady-state savings rate is s =        , and

Our model implies the same cross-country relationship as the Solow model with two
exceptions: (i) the e±ciency parameter A captures the e®ects of both the technology term,
¹,17 and the inverse of the relative price of investment goods, Á; and (ii) the elasticity
of relative income to savings depends not on the capital share, but on the degree of
specialization, ", and the volume of trade, ¿ . In particular, the equivalent of ® in equation
          "¡1
(20) is             in our model, so the elasticity of output to savings is decoupled from
        ¿ +"¡1
the capital share.18
    To discuss the empirical implications of our model further, it is useful to calculate the
implied elasticity of output to savings for plausible parameter values. The two crucial
parameters are ¿ and ". Because of Cobb-Douglas preferences, the share of traded goods,
¿ , is also equal to the share of exports in GDP. Except for the U.S. and Japan, this number
is around 30 percent or higher for rich economies (see World Development Report, 1997).
So here we take it to be ¿ = 0:3. Next recall that " corresponds to the elasticity of export
demand. Estimates of this elasticity in the literature are for speci¯c industries, and vary
between 2 and 10, though there are also estimates outside this range (see, for example,
Feenstra, 1994, or Lai and Tre°er, 1999). For our purposes, we need the elasticity for the
  15                                                     _
     The savings rate in our model is de¯ned as s = pI ¢ k=y.   To obtain the equation in the text, simply
use equations (13) and (15).
  16
     In practice, Mankiw, Romer and Weil (1992) use the investment to output ratio, i rather than the
savings rate. Summers and Heston (1991) construct i with a correction for di®erences in relative prices
of investment goods across countries, so e®ectively i = s=pI . Using this de¯nition, an alternative way of
expressing the empirical predictions of our model is
                                                    µ ¶"¡1

                                                      x¤
In this case, the e±ciency parameter, A, is simply equal to ¹, and the equivalent of ® in equation (20) is
(" ¡ 1) =". The quantitative predictions of our model are a®ected little by this change.
  17
     In our full model of Section 5, we endogeneize ¹ and show that it depends on the rate of time
reference, ½.
  18
     In this economy, the capital share in national product is equal to 1. In the next section, when we
introduce labor, the capital share will no longer be 1, but the elasticity of output to savings will remain
unchanged.

whole economy, not for a speci¯c industry. Below we use cross-country data on changes
in terms of trade to estimate an elasticity of " = 2:3. So here we use this as our baseline
estimate. With " = 2:3, our model's predictions for cross-country income di®erences are
identical to those of the Solow model with ® = 0:8. As we consider higher values for the
elasticity of export demand, ", the implied elasticity of output to savings increases even
further.

3.2      Re-Interpreting Conditional Convergence

Another salient characteristic of the postwar growth process is conditional convergence.
Barro (1991) and Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995) run regressions of the form:

                                    gt = ¡¯ ¢ ln yt¡1 + Zt0 ¢ µ + ut ;                                 (21)

where gt is the annual growth rate of income of the country between some dates t ¡ 1
and t, and Zt is a set of covariates that determine steady-state income. The parameter
¯ is interpreted as the speed of (conditional) convergence towards steady state. These
regressions typically estimate a value of ¯ ¼ 0:02 corresponding to a rate of conditional
convergence of about 2 percent a year. Conditional convergence is consistent with the
implications of the Solow-Ramsey model, but the rate of convergence is slower than that
predicted by the basic model.
       It is possible to obtain explicit equations for the rate of convergence to steady state
in our model. Let us de¯ne the growth rate of output as g ´ y=y,
                                                            _    then we have:19
                                                2Ã ! ¿            3

                                                                    ;                                  (22)
                                     "                     yR            ½+x

When a county is at its steady state value, i.e., yR = yR¤ , it grows at the rate (x + (" ¡ 1) ¢
x¤ )=", which is a weighted average of the steady-state world growth rate, x¤ , and the
current world growth rate, x. When the world is also in steady state, i.e., x = x¤ , the
country grows at the world growth rate x¤ . If yR is below its steady-state value, it grows
at a rate that depends on the distance away from this steady state, the elasticity of export
demand, ", the share of traded goods, ¿ , and the rate of time preference, ½.
  19
     To obtain this equation, we use the trade balance condition (12) and the budget constraint (2) to
get an expression for y in terms of world income, Y , and the capital stock of the country, k: y =
(¹ ¢ Y )1=" ¢ k("¡1)=" . We then time-di®erentiate this equation, and substitute from (13) for k=k
                                                                                               _   and (12)
                                                                                                          ¤
for r to obtain an expression for y=y,
                                    _    and then substitute for the steady-state relative income level, yR ,
from (16).

                                                     14
       The speed of convergence, ¯ = ¡dg=d ln y, in this model is therefore
                                                          Ã    !¡    ¿
                                       ¿              yR            "¡1
                                    ¯ = ¢ (½ + x¤ ) ¢ ¤                   :                            (23)
                                       "              yR

 As in the Solow-Ramsey model, the speed of convergence is not constant; countries
away from their steady states grow faster. Near the steady state, yR ¼ yR¤ , we have
         ¿
that ¯ = ¢ (½ + x¤ ). The baseline values of parameters suggested by Barro and Sala-i-
         "
Martin (1995) imply that the term in parentheses is about 0:1.20 With these values, the
Solow model would match the speed of convergence of approximately 2 percent a year,
if ® = 0:8, i.e., once again with a value of ® much larger than the capital share in the
data. In contrast, with our baseline elasticity of export demand " = 2:3 and the share of
exports in GDP ¿ = 0:3, our model implies ¯ = 0:013. So the model's implications are
broadly consistent with the speed of conditional convergence observed in the data. With
a higher elasticity of export demand, ", the implied rate of convergence would be even
slower.

3.3     Empirical Evidence on Terms of Trade Changes

At the center of our framework is the idea that as a country accumulates more capital,
its terms of trade deteriorate. Is there any evidence supporting this notion? A natural
place to start may be to look at the correlation between growth and changes in terms of
trade. Consider equation (12) which links the terms of trade of a country to its relative
income. Taking logs and time di®erences, we obtain
                                           ¡1
                                   ¼t =       ¢ (gt ¡ xt ) + ¢ ln ¹t                                   (24)
                                          "¡1
where ¼t is de¯ned as the rate of change in the terms of trade between date t and some
prior date t ¡ 1, gt is the rate of growth of the country's income, xt is the rate of growth
of world income, and ¢ ln ¹t is the change in technology. More generally, this last term
stands for all changes that a®ect income and terms of trade positively, including changes
in technology and world's tastes towards the country's products.
  20
    The standard formula includes the rate of population growth, n, and the rate of depreciation of
capital, ±, which we have set to zero to simplify notation. It is easy to check that if we allow for positive
                                                                               ¿
population growth and depreciation, the speed of convergence would be ¯ = ¢(½+n+± +x¤ ). Barro and
                                                                               "
Sala-i-Martin suggest a parameterization with an annual discount factor of about 0:99 (i.e., ½ = 0:02),
a depreciation rate of 5 percent, a world growth rate of 2 percent, and a population growth rate of 1
percent per annum. This implies ½ + n + ± + x¤ ¼ 0:1.

                                                     15
   In theory, we can estimate an equation of the form (24) using cross-country data and
look at the coe±cient of gt . A negative coe±cient would imply that, as in our theory,
a country that accumulates faster than others experiences a worsening in its terms of
trade. Unfortunately, in practice, we do not have direct measures of the technology
term, ¢ ln ¹t , so the only option is to estimate (24) without this term, or with some
proxies. Since changes in technology will be directly correlated with changes in income,
estimates from an equation of the form (24) will be biased and hard to interpret. This
is the standard identi¯cation problem, and to make progress we need to isolate changes
in growth rates that are plausibly orthogonal to the omitted technology term ¢ ln ¹t . An
ideal source of variation would come from countries growing at di®erent rates because
they have started in di®erent positions relative to their steady-state income level and are
therefore accumulating at di®erent rates to approach their steady state.
   How can we isolate changes in income due to accumulation? Here we make a prelimi-
nary attempt by using a convergence equation like (21). Recall that these equations relate
cross-country di®erences in growth rates to two sets of factors: (i) a set of covariates, Zt ,
which determine the relative steady-state position of the country; and (ii) the initial level
of income, which captures how far the country is from its relative steady-state position.
Accordingly, di®erences in growth due to the second set of factors approximate changes
in income due to accumulation, and give us an opportunity to investigate whether faster
accumulation leads to worse terms of trade.
   The estimating equation is

                                   ¼t = ± ¢ gt + Zt0 ¢ ! + vt                            (25)

where, as before, ¼t is the rate of change in terms of trade, and gt is the growth rate of
output. We will estimate (25) using Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS), instrumenting gt
using equation (21). The vector Zt includes a set of covariates that Barro and Sala-i-
Martin (1995) include in the growth regressions of the form (21). We include them in the
second stage equation (25), since they may also a®ect the terms of trade. The coe±cient
of interest is ±, which, in our theory, corresponds to ¡1= (" ¡ 1) as in (24).
   The excluded instrument in our 2SLS estimation is the initial level of income, ln yt¡1 .
Intuitively, there is no obvious reason for why, once we condition on income growth and
other covariates, the initial level of income should a®ect the change in the terms of trade.
Moreover, as the large literature on conditional convergence documents, the initial level
of income has a strong predictive power on subsequent growth, and this e®ect seems

                                              16
to work through accumulation: countries further away from their steady-state position
accumulate more.21 This makes ln yt¡1 an ideal instrument for estimating (25).22
       To implement this procedure, we use data from the Barro and Lee (1993) data set
for the period 1965-1985. We estimate cross-sectional regressions of the rate of change
of terms of trade between 1965 and 1985 on the growth rate of income and various sets
of covariates as in equation (25). Table 1 reports the results. The top panel reports
the 2SLS estimate of ±, the coe±cient on output growth. The middle panel reports the
¯rst-stage relationship, in particular, the convergence parameter ¯. Finally, the bottom
panel reports the OLS estimate of ±. Di®erent columns correspond to di®erent sets of
covariates. In all 2SLS speci¯cations, to save space we report only the coe±cients on
a few of the covariates. The footnote to the table gives the full set of other covariates
included in each column. In the ¯rst-stage relationship, the coe±cients are very similar
to the convergence equations estimated by Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995), and we do not
report them here.
       In column 1, we start with a minimal set of covariates that control for human capital
di®erences. These are average years of schooling in the population over age 25 in 1965
and the log of life expectancy at birth in 1965. Both of these variables are typically found
to be important determinants of country growth rates, so they are natural variables to
include in our Zt vector. We also include a dummy for oil producers, since over the period
1965-85, the increase in the price of oil is likely to have led to an improvement in the
terms of trade of these countries. The coe±cient on log GDP in 1965 reported in Panel
B shows the standard result of conditional convergence at the speed of approximately 2
percent a year. The estimate of the coe±cient of interest, ±, in column 1 is -0.73 with a
standard error of 0.31. This estimate implies that a country growing 1 percentage point
faster due to accumulation experiences a 0.73 percentage point decline in its terms of
trade. This estimate is statistically signi¯cant at the 5 percent level. The coe±cient
on years of schooling is insigni¯cant, while the coe±cients on life expectancy and the
  21
      In the presence of technological convergence, countries below their steady state may also be improving
their technologies, and ln yt¡1 may be correlated with ¢ ln ¹t . In this case, our estimate of ± would be
biased upwards, stacking the cards against ¯nding a negative ±. More generally, this consideration
suggests that we may want to interpret our estimate of the strength of the terms of trade e®ects as a
lower bound.
   22
      There is a debate on how regressions of the form (21) should be interpreted, and whether the coe±cient
on ln yt¡1 is biased or not, for example because of attenuation bias. See, for example, Quah (1993). This
is not important for our purposes, since (21) is only the ¯rst-stage relationship for us. Attenuation bias
in the ¯rst-stage relationship does not lead to bias in the 2SLS estimates.



                                                    17
oil producer dummy are positive and statistically signi¯cant. The coe±cient on the oil
producer dummy implies that, all else equal, the terms of trade of oil producers improved
at approximately 0.075 percentage points a year during this period. We return to the
interpretation of the other covariates later. Notice also that the OLS coe±cient reported
in Panel C is insigni¯cant and practically equal to 0. The contrast between the OLS and
the 2SLS estimates likely re°ects the fact that the 2SLS procedure is isolating changes in
income that are due to accumulation and hence orthogonal to ¢ ln ¹t .
   In column 2, we enter years of primary, secondary and tertiary schooling separately,
and this has little e®ect on the estimate of ±. In column 3, we include the average invest-
ment rate between 1965 and 1985, which again has little e®ect; ± is now estimated to be
-0.82 with a standard error of 0.34. The next three columns add other covariates from
the set of common controls of Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995), including the ratio of gov-
ernment consumption expenditure to GDP, dummies for sub-Saharan Africa, East Asian
countries, and Latin America, an index of political instability, a dummy for experiencing
a war during this period, and the black market premium. The variables on war, political
instability and black market premium are generally interpreted to capture the security of
property rights faced by investors. The estimates now vary between -0.51 and -1.08, and
are always signi¯cant at the 5 percent level
   In column 7, we exclude the 6 oil producers from the sample (Algeria, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Jordan and Venezuela) and re-estimate our basic speci¯cation of column 1. This
reduces the estimate of ± to -0.63 (standard error=0.35). This estimate is now marginally
insigni¯cant at the 5 percent level, but continues to be signi¯cant at the 10 percent.
Column 8 instead excludes the sub-Saharan African countries, reducing the sample to 62.
The estimates of ± now increases to -0.98 with a standard error of 0.4, and is signi¯cant
at the 5 percent level.
   In columns 1-8, the covariates are di±cult to interpret because they refer to values at
the beginning of the sample. For example, a 10 percent higher life expectancy in 1965 is
associated with 0.5 percentage point improvement in terms of trade. This may capture the
fact that initial level of life expectancy (or years of schooling) is correlated with subsequent
changes in these human capital variables and therefore possibly correlated with ¢ ln ¹t
as well. In columns 9 and 10, we add changes in years of schooling and life expectancy
between 1965 and 1985 to the basic regression of column 1. In column 9, these changes are
entered as additional covariates. In column 10, we instead use the initial levels of years


                                              18
of schooling and life expectancy as excluded instruments in addition to the initial level of
income. In both columns, the estimate of ± is negative and statistically signi¯cant at 5
percent. We ¯nd that changes in the years of schooling are positive and signi¯cant in the
second stage, indicating that countries that increased their human capital over this period
experienced improvements in their terms of trade. This is reasonable since improvements
in human capital are likely to be correlated with ¢ ln ¹t .23
       Overall, the results in Table 1 provide evidence that higher output growth due to
accumulation is associated with a worsening in the terms of trade, as implied by our
mechanism. Given the relatively low number of observations and the usual di±culties
in interpreting cross-country regressions, this result has to be interpreted with caution.
Nevertheless, it is encouraging for our theory.
       We can also use the magnitudes of the coe±cient estimates to compute implied values
for the export demand elasticity ". For example, the estimate in column 1, -0.73, implies
" ¼ 2:3. This is a reasonable elasticity estimate, within the range of the industry estimates,
albeit on the low side. Returning to the discussion in the previous two subsections,
recall that with a value of " around 2.3, our model comes close to explaining most of
the variability in income levels across countries and the observed speed of conditional
convergence. Therefore, this evidence not only points to the presence of signi¯cant terms
of trade e®ects, but also suggests that these terms of trade e®ects are quantitatively
important in accounting for observed patterns of income di®erences and growth.

                                              4    Labor

A salient feature of the world economy is that wages for comparable workers are higher in
richer countries. The model developed in the previous section is silent on this important
fact, since it does not include labor as a factor of production.24
       Another set of important regularities in the data refer to relative product prices. The
  23
     We experimented with di®erent speci¯cations and various subsets of covariates, with similar results.
We also estimated ± using decadal changes, and a random-e®ect model as in Barro and Sala-i-Martin
(1995) and Barro (1997)'s favorite speci¯cation. In this case, the results are similar to those reported in
Table 1, but more precise because of the greater number of observations. For example, the equivalent of
column 1 yields an estimate of ± of -0.97 with a standard error of 0.3. The equivalent of column 3 yields
an estimate of -0.95 with a standard error of 0.29, the equivalent of column 4 yields an estimate of -0.99
with a standard error of 0.32, while the equivalent of column 7 which excludes oil producers yields an
estimate of -0.68 with a standard error of 0.35.
  24
     With a broad view of capital k as including both physical and human capital, r would also correspond
to return to human capital. Since r is lower in rich countries, this view would lead to the counterfactual
implication that wages for workers with the same human capital are higher in poor countries.

                                                    19
cost of living (or the real exchange rate) is higher in rich countries, while the price of
investment goods relative to consumption goods is lower in rich countries. Figure 2 plots
the cost of living and the relative price of investment goods for the set of 1985 benchmark
countries of the Summers and Heston (1991) dataset. The ¯gure shows a clear positive
relationship between income per capita and the cost of living, and a negative relationship
between income and the relative price of investment goods. While the model in the
previous section can account for the di®erences in the relative price of investment goods
as a result of di®erences in Á, it is at odds with the cost of living variations, as it implies
that both consumption and investment goods should be cheaper in rich countries.25
       These observations on wages and costs of living are likely to be related. The trade liter-
ature typically explains higher costs of living with higher wages (Balassa, 1964; Samuelson,
1964; Bhagwati, 1984; Kravis and Lipsey, 1983). Intuitively, when the law of one price
applies for traded goods, di®erences in the cost of living re°ect di®erences in the prices
of nontraded goods. Nontraded goods consist mostly of services and tend to be labor
intensive. So cross-country di®erences in the price of nontraded goods and the cost of
living simply mirror cross-country di®erences in wages.
       In this section, we introduce labor as a production factor in our baseline model of
Section 2. While this modi¯cation has no e®ect on the predictions regarding the world
income distribution, it generates higher wages and higher costs of living in richer countries.
It also demonstrates that our key results, including the responsiveness of income to savings
and economic policies, do not depend on the capital share in national product.

4.1      The Model with Labor

We add two assumptions to our model from Section 2. First, the production of the
consumption good now requires labor. In particular, we adopt the following unit cost
function:
                                                                 20                 ¿ 3
                                                                                 1 1¡"
                                                                   ZM
                 BC (w; r; p (z)) = w(1¡°)¢(1¡¿ ) ¢ r°¢(1¡¿ )   ¢6
                                                                 4@ p(z)
                                                                        1¡"
                                                                            ¢ dz A 7   5;           (26)
                                                                    0

which is identical to equation (10), except for the presence of domestic labor services in
production.
  25
     Equations (10), (11), and (15) imply that both consumption and investment goods should be more
expensive in countries that are poorer because of low Á and high ½. On the other hand, the relative price
of investment goods in our model is simply Á¡1 . So countries with high Á, which are, ceteris paribus,
richer, also have lower relative prices of investment goods as in the data.

                                                    20
   Second, each consumer supplies one unit of labor inelastically. The budget constraint
of the representative consumer then becomes:

                              pI ¢ k_ + pC ¢ c = y ´ r ¢ k + w;                             (27)

where w is the wage rate. The rest of the assumptions in Section 2.1 remain the same.
The model in that section is therefore the limiting case in which ° ! 1. In this limit,
labor is not used in production and the wage is zero.
   The description of the world equilibrium in Section 2.2 needs to be revised. Consumers
now maximize the utility function (1) subject to the new budget constraint (27). The so-
lution to this problem still involves the Euler equation (5) and the transversality condition
(6). Once again integrating the budget constraint and using the Euler and transversality
conditions, we obtain the consumption rule as:
                                     0                         Rt                    1
                                                Z1         ¡
                                                                    r+p_I
                                                                            ¢dv
                       pC ¢ c = ½ ¢ B                                                C
                                                                     pI
                                    @pI ¢ k +        w¢e       0                  ¢ dtA :   (28)
                                                 0

The optimal rule is still to consume a ¯xed fraction of wealth, which now also includes
the net present value of wages.
   The existence of labor income has no e®ect on ¯rms in the intermediate and investment
goods sectors. So equations (8) and (11) still apply. But the condition that price equals
marginal cost for the ¯rms in the consumption good sector is now given by:

                                  pC = w(1¡°)¢(1¡¿ ) ¢ r°¢(1¡¿ ) ;                          (29)

so prices of consumption goods depend on the wage rate.
   Since we now have two factor markets, the trade balance condition, (12), is not su±-
cient to ensure market clearing, and we need to add a labor market clearing condition to
complete the model. Labor demand comes only from the consumption goods sector, and
given the Cobb-Douglas assumption, this demand is (1 ¡ °) ¢ (1 ¡ ¿ ) times consumption
expenditure, pC ¢ c, divided by the wage rate, w. So the market clearing condition for
labor is:
                                                     pC ¢ c
                               1 = (1 ¡ °) ¢ (1 ¡ ¿ ) ¢     :                        (30)
                                                      w
   It is useful to note that (30) implies labor income, w, is always proportional to con-
sumption expenditure. Using this fact, we can simplify the optimal consumption rule,
(28), to obtain
                                               ½
                           pC ¢ c =                          ¢ pI ¢ k:                      (31)
                                      1 ¡ (1 ¡ °) ¢ (1 ¡ ¿ )

                                                21
       The law of motion of the world economy is again described by a distribution of capital
stocks, but now this distribution is given by a triplet of equations for each country:26

                                            k_
                                               = Á ¢ r¿ ¡ ½:                                          (32)
                                            k
                                                           Z
                                                 1¡"
                              r¢k+w = ¹¢r              ¢       (r ¢ k + w) ¢ dG:                      (33)

                     w                  (1 ¡ °) ¢ (1 ¡ ¿ ) ¢ ½
                         =                                                      :                     (34)
                   r¢k+w   [° + (1 ¡ °) ¢ ¿ ] ¢ Á ¢ r¿ + (1 ¡ °) ¢ (1 ¡ ¿ ) ¢ ½
       Equation (32) is the law of motion for capital. It is identical to (13) and gives the
evolution of the distribution of capital stocks for a given distribution of rental rates.
Equation (33) is simply the new budget constraint which determines the cross-section of
rental rates for a given distribution of capital stocks and wage rates. The third equation,
(34), de¯nes the labor share|wage income divided by total income. It is added to the
system to determine the distribution of wages across countries. Intuitively, from (30),
wage income is equal to (1 ¡ °) ¢ (1 ¡ ¿ ) times consumption expenditure, pC ¢ c, which is
itself proportional to capital income from (31). This equation also shows that the behavior
of the labor share simply depends on the rental rate: as the rental rate increases, the labor
share falls.
    The steady-state world distribution of income follows from equations (32) and (33).
                 _ = x¤ , i.e., all countries will grow at the same rate. This immediately
In steady state, k=k
gives the steady-state rental rate as in equation (15) from the previous section. More
important for our purposes, the steady-state distribution of income and the world growth
rate are still given by equations (16) and (17). Therefore, the intuition regarding the
determinants of the cross-sectional distribution of income from Section 2.3 still applies.
Moreover, the empirical implications, and the ¯t of the model to existing evidence, dis-
cussed in Section 3, are also valid.27 But there are new implications for the cross-section
of wages and some key relative prices, which we discuss below.
  26
     To obtain (32), we start with (27), and substitute for w using (30), for pC ¢ c using (31), and for pI
using (11). Equation (33) is simply the trade balance condition, (12), rearranged with y = r ¢ k + w.
Finally, we use (11), (30) and (31) to express w as a function of k and r, and then rearrange to obtain
(34).
  27
     The equation describing convergence to steady state is also similar. In particular, equation (22) from
the previous section still gives the rate of growth of capital income (relative to average capital income),
      k                                                                                               k   k
say yR  , but now total income also includes labor income. We can write relative income as yR ´ yR      =³R
          k
where ³R is the share of capital income relative to the average value of this share in the world. As long
as factor shares do not change much near the steady state, equation (22) still describes the convergence
properties of this more general model.

                                                    22
4.2      Factor Prices

Equations (32), (33), and (34) give the steady-state factor prices:
                                            Ã            !1=¿
                                       ¤        ½ + x¤
                                      r =                       ; and                               (35)

                            [° + (1 ¡ °) ¢ ¿ ] ¢ x + ½     ½ + x¤
There are a number of important features to note.
       In the cross section, the rental rate of capital continues to be lower in richer countries|
i.e., countries with low ½ and high Á. In contrast, wages tend to be higher in richer coun-
tries: countries with better technology (high ¹) and with better economic policies (high
Á) will have higher wages. Both of these follow because richer countries generate a greater
demand for consumption, increasing the demand for labor and wages. Interestingly, the
e®ect of ½ on wages is ambiguous. Countries with low ½ will accumulate more and tend
to be richer, and through the same mechanism, they will have a greater demand for con-
sumption and higher wages. However, as equation (31) shows, everything else equal, a
country with low ½ will consume less, which tends to reduce the demand for consumption
and wages.28
       The contrast between the behavior of the rental rate and the wage rate in the time
series is also interesting. While the rental rate of capital remains constant, equation (36)
shows that wages in all countries grow at the rate of world income growth. This prediction
is consistent with the stylized facts on the long-run behavior of factor prices.
       Finally, recall that equation (34) gives the share of labor in national product, so the
capital share in national product is no longer equal to 1, while relative income di®erences
are exactly the same as in the model of Sections 2 and 4. This highlights that, as claimed
before, the result that the responsiveness of relative income to savings and economic
policies depends on the share of exports in GDP and export demand elasticity was not
predicated on a capital share of 1.29
                                 ¤                                 ¤    ¤
                                                     [°+(1¡°)¢¿ ]¢x ¢¿ ¢(½+x )
  28
     Di®erentiation gives that @w
                                @½ < 0 () " > 1 + ½2 +[°+(1¡°)¢¿ ]¢½¢x¤ . In other words, as long as the
elasticity of foreign demand is large enough, countries with low ½ will have higher wages.
  29
     More generally, although the responsiveness of output to saving rates and policies does not depend
on the capital share in national product, it can be shown that it does depend on the capital share in the
investment goods sector.




                                                   23
4.3     Costs of Living and the Relative Price of Investment Goods

We now turn to the implications of this extended model for product prices. While in the
model of Section 2 both consumption and investment goods were cheaper in rich countries,
now equation (29) implies that consumption goods tend to be more expensive in richer
countries. This is because wages are higher in rich countries.
      To discuss the implications regarding to di®erences in costs of living, de¯ne the cost of
living in a country as the geometric average of consumption and investment goods prices,
with weights 1 ¡ ¾ and ¾:

                    e = p1¡¾
                         C   ¢ p¾I = Á¡¾ ¢ w(1¡¾)¢(1¡°)¢(1¡¿ ) ¢ r[¾+(1¡¾)¢°]¢(1¡¿ ) :

In the data, ¾ is usually chosen as some average share of consumption and investment
goods (for example, in a benchmark country or in the world). Whether the cost of
living, e, is higher in rich countries will depend on ¾, and how di®erent consumption
and investment good prices are across countries. Given the share of income spent on
investment is relatively small, typically around 0.2, di®erences in consumption good prices
are likely to dominate di®erences in the costs of living. Therefore, we expect rich countries
with higher wages to have higher costs of living.
      The relative price of investment goods is now:
                                                 µ    ¶¡(1¡°)¢(1¡¿ )
                                    pI         w
                                       = Á¡1 ¢                         :
                                    pC         r
This is di®erent from the relative price expression in the previous model because of the
second term, which incorporates the fact that consumption goods are more labor-intensive
than investment goods. Our model in Section 2 generated lower relative prices of invest-
ment goods in rich countries only because of di®erences in policies, Á. Now we have an
additional e®ect reinforcing this: richer countries have higher wages, reducing the relative
prices of investment goods.

                     5   Where Does Specialization Come From?

The previous two sections have shown how trade and specialization shape the process of
world growth and cross-country income di®erences. At the center stage of our framework
is diminishing returns due to terms of trade e®ects: as countries accumulate more capital,
they increase the production of the commodities in which they specialize, and their terms
of trade worsen. There are two assumptions underlying this mechanism:

                                                     24
   1. Each country specializes in a di®erent set of products.

   2. The set of products a country produces is ¯xed (or, at least, it does not grow
         proportionally with its income).

       The importance of these two assumptions is highlighted in equation (18). If countries
were not specialized, or if " ! 1 so that di®erent goods were perfect substitutes, they
would face °at export demands. In this case, capital accumulation and greater production
of intermediates would not worsen the terms of trade. If, on the other hand, the set of
products in which a country specializes were proportional to its income, the production
of each variety would not change with income. In this case, even with downward-sloping
export demands, capital accumulation would not worsen the terms of trade. In this
section, we show that these assumptions can be justi¯ed as the equilibrium of a model in
which countries choose the set of goods they produce.
       The two most popular explanations for why countries specialize in di®erent products
are based on increasing returns in production and costly development of new products.30 If
there are ¯xed costs in production, countries choose to specialize in di®erentiated products
so as to have enough market power to recoup the ¯xed costs. If developing new products
is costly, countries choose to develop di®erentiated products so as to have enough market
power to recover the costs of creating new products. Not surprisingly, these elements
can be used to justify the ¯rst assumption. Moreover, we show that if the ¯xed costs
of production or the costs of creating new products require the scarce factor |labor|,
the number of varieties in each country does not increase with income. This justi¯es the
second assumption.
       We next develop two models with these features. As a byproduct of this analysis, we
obtain a simple theory of total factor productivity (TFP) di®erences, whereby countries
with higher saving rates have relatively higher TFP levels. Furthermore, we show that
our results do not depend on whether all countries share the same technology or not: in
the model with increasing returns in production, all countries have access to the same
technology frontier; in the model with costly product development, each country possesses
the know-how to produce a di®erent set of products.
  30
    See Helpman and Krugman (1985) and Grossman and Helpman (1991) for a thorough discussion
of models of trade under increasing returns to production and costly development of new products.
Specialization may also arise because of large di®erences in factor proportions, even when production
exhibits constant returns and there are no costs of developing new products.



                                                 25
5.1    Increasing Returns in Production

We now present a model in which specialization results from increasing returns in pro-
duction. We introduce two modi¯cations to the model of Section 4. First, we assume
that there is an in¯nite mass of intermediates, and all ¯rms in all countries know how
to produce them. Hence, all countries have access to the same technology frontier. The
total number of goods produced, M , as well as its distribution among countries, ¹, is
determined as part of the equilibrium.
      Second, we assume that one worker is needed to run the production process for each
intermediate. So there is a ¯xed cost of production equal to the wage, w. In addition,
one unit of capital is required to produce one unit of each intermediate, so there is also a
variable cost in terms of the rental rate of capital, r. The rest of the assumptions from
Section 4 still apply.
      The description of the world equilibrium needs to be revised slightly. The consumer
problem is still to maximize (1) subject to the budget constraint, (27). The solution
continues to be given by the Euler equation (5) and the transversality condition (6).
Alternatively, the consumption rule is still represented by (28) from the previous section.
      Firms in the consumption and investment goods sectors face the same problem as be-
fore, and equations (11) and (26) still determine their prices. But ¯rms in the intermediate
goods sector are now subject to economies of scale. Since an in¯nite number of varieties
is available at no cost, no two ¯rms will ever choose to produce the same good. So each
producer is a monopolist. With isoelastic demands, all intermediate good monopolists in
a country will set the same price, equal to a constant markup over marginal cost (which
is equal to the rental rate, r):
                                          "
                                       p=     ¢ r:                               (37)
                                        "¡1
Hence, the terms of trade are no longer equal, but simply proportional, to the rental
rate of capital. Because of the markup over marginal cost, each producer makes variable
pro¯ts equal to "¡1 times its revenue, ¿ ¢ p1¡" ¢ Y . As long as these variable pro¯ts exceed
the cost of entry, there will be entry. So we have a free-entry equation equating variable
pro¯ts to ¯xed costs:

                                         ¿ 1¡"
                                      w=   ¢ p ¢ Y;                                (38)
                                         "
where w, the wage rate, is the ¯xed cost of producing an intermediate, since one worker
is required to run the production process.

                                             26
       To complete the description of the equilibrium, we need to impose market clearing.
The trade balance equation, (12), still applies. The market clearing condition for labor
needs to be modi¯ed because now ¹ workers are employed in the intermediate sector:
                                                                 pC ¢ c

                                                                   w
       The law of motion for the world was written in Section 4 as a triplet, describing the
dynamics of the state variable k and factor prices, r and w. Now, this law of motion
will be more complicated for two reasons. First, the consumption to capital ratio is no
                                                      pC ¢ c
longer constant, so we need to add this ratio, z ´           , as a co-state variable, and
                                                      pI ¢ k
include the transversality condition to determine the trajectory of the system. Second,
the number of varieties is now endogenous and will be determined from the free-entry
condition, equation (38).
       The laws of motion of the key variables is given by two blocks of equations for each
country:

   1. Dynamics. For a given distribution of factor prices, r and w, and varieties, ¹, this
         block determines the evolution of the distribution of capital stocks:31

         Equation (40) gives the evolution of the capital stock as a function of the rental rate,
         r, the number of varieties, ¹, and the consumption to capital ratio, z. It di®ers from
         (32) only because the consumption to capital ratio now varies over time. Equation
         (41) gives the evolution of the consumption to capital ratio as a function of the
         number of varieties, ¹. Finally, equation (42) is the transversality condition.

   2. Factor prices and varieties. Three equations give the cross-section of factor prices
         and the number of varieties of intermediates as functions of the distribution of

         Equation (12) is the trade balance equation and di®ers from (33) because, due to
         monopoly power, the rental rate and the terms of trade are not equal (see equation
         (37)). Equation (44) gives the labor share. It di®ers from (34) because the con-
         sumption to capital ratio, z, and hence the demand for labor, change over time, and
         also because a fraction ¹ of workers are now employed in the intermediate sector.
         Finally, (45) is the free entry condition.

       The dynamics of the world economy are again stable and converge to a unique steady
state. This steady state is relatively simple to characterize. It is described by two equa-
tions similar to (16) and (17):
                                            µ        ¶"¡1 Ã                 ! "¡1

                                    "                  ½ + x¤
The reason why (46) and (47) di®er from (16) and (17) is the presence of monopoly
markup. Otherwise, they are identical to (16) and (17), and imply the same cross-sectional
relationship between economic policies, saving rates and technology.
       The key modi¯cation is that the number of varieties is now endogenous and given
by:33
                                         ½ + x¤ ¢ [1 ¡ (1 ¡ °) ¢ (1 ¡ ¿ )]
                          ¹¤ = ¿ ¢                                             :                    (48)
                                     ½ ¢ [¿ + " ¢ (1 ¡ °) ¢ (1 ¡ ¿ )] + ¿ ¢ x¤
  32
     Equation (43) follows from (12) combined with (37). The wage equation, (44), follows from the
market clearing condition for labor, (39), and the de¯nition of z in a manner analogous to the derivation
of equation (34) in footnote 26. Finally the free-entry equation, (45), is obtained by substituting for
world income, Y .
  33
     To obtain this equation, we divide the free-entry condition (45) by the trade balance condition (43)
          w       ¿
to get r¢k+w  = "¢¹  . We then equate this to the labor share equation, (44), and then substitute the
steady-state value of z from equation (41).


                                                      28
The only country-speci¯c variable in this equation is ½. So all countries have similar
¹'s, but those with lower discount rates (and hence higher saving rates) endogenously
specialize in the production of more goods|or loosely speaking, they will \choose better
technologies". Intuitively, countries with low ½ accumulate more capital and have a larger
capital stock relative to their wage rates. For a given number of goods, they therefore
face worse terms of trade. Consequently, they ¯nd it pro¯table to incur the ¯xed cost of
production for more goods.
     Now that technology di®erences, ¹'s, are endogenous, there are two determinants of
cross-country income di®erences: countries with better economic policies (i.e., high Á)
will be richer for the same reasons as before. Countries with lower discount rates (i.e.,
high ½) will be richer both because of the reasons highlighted in Sections 2 and 4, and
because they will choose to specialize in the production of more intermediates.
     Notice that technology di®erences in this model simply translate into di®erences in
relative incomes, not long-run growth rates. This appears plausible since there is evidence
pointing to signi¯cant technology di®erences across countries (e.g., Klenow and Rodriguez,
1997, Hall and Jones, 1999), and as noted in the introduction, these di®erences do not
seem to lead to permanent di®erences in growth rates.
     To understand why the steady-state number of goods is independent of the level of
capital stock or income (cfr. equation (48)), denote the ¯xed cost of production by f (in
equation (38), we had f = w). Then using (12), the free-entry condition can be written
as
                                          ¿ y
                                        ¹=  ¢ :
                                          " f
This equation states that the number of goods in which a country specializes is propor-
tional to its income divided by the ¯xed cost of production. The reason why ¹ is constant
is that as y increases f increases also. This is a consequence of the assumption that ¯xed
costs are in terms of the scarce factor. As the country becomes richer, demand for labor
(from the consumption sector) increases, causing a proportional increase in the wage rate.
So, y=f and ¹ remain constant.
     It is also useful to contemplate what would happen if the ¯xed cost f depended on
the wage rate, but less than proportionately, say f = w³ where ³ < 1. As long as ³ > 0,
¹ would still increase with income, but less than proportionately. As a result, our key
mechanism, that an increase in production translates into worse terms of trade, would
continue to hold, since, from equation (18), terms of trade are proportional to ¹=y, and


                                             29
are decreasing in y. Nevertheless, in this case, the model would not be well-behaved
for another reason: as ¹ increases with income, the world growth rate would increase
over time, eventually becoming in¯nite. This explains our particular choice of f = w to
preserve steady endogenous growth.

5.2     Costly Product Development

We next present a model in which specialization results from costly product development.
We simply introduce one modi¯cation to the model of Section 4. Now ¯rms in the inter-
mediates sector can develop new products by undertaking R&D. Each worker employed
in an R&D ¯rm discovers new products at the °ow rate ¸. We also assume that existing
products become obsolete at the °ow rate ±.
       Let l be the number of workers devoted to R&D. Then our assumptions imply that
the law of motion for the number of varieties that the country produces is given by

                                              ¹_ = ¸ ¢ l ¡ ± ¢ ¹:                                   (49)


       A ¯rm that discovers a new product receives a perfectly enforced patent.34 As a
result, ¯rms in di®erent countries know how to produce di®erent sets of intermediates.
We maintain the rest of the assumptions from Section 4.
       The description of the world equilibrium needs to be revised slighlty. The consumer
problem is still to maximize (1) subject to the budget constraint, (27). The solution
continues to be given by the Euler equation (5) and the transversality condition (6).
       Firms in the consumption and investment goods sectors face the same problem as
before, and equations (11) and (26) still determine their prices. Firms in the intermediates
sector are monopolists as in the previous subsection. Since they face isoelastic demands,
they set their prices as in (37). In addition, they undertake R&D to discover new products.
Let v be the value of a new product. By standard arguments, this value must satisfy the
Bellman (asset value) equation:
                          Ã                   !
                              r + p_I   p_C              ¿ 1¡"
                                      ¡           ¢v =     ¢ p ¢ Y ¡ ± ¢ v + v:
                                                                             _                      (50)
                                pI      pC               "
Equation (50) equates the opportunity cost of holding the asset, i.e., the interest rate
times the value of the product to the °ow return. This °ow return consists of the °ow of
  34
    We assume that there is no international enforcement of intellectual property rights, so ¯rms have to
use the products in the country in which they are located.

                                                         30
pro¯ts net of obsolescence and the appreciation in the asset value. Associated with this
Bellman equation, we impose the standard no-bubble condition.
     Firms allocate labor to R&D until the value of the marginal product of a worker, ¸ ¢ v,
equals the wage, w. So
                                          ¸ ¢ v = w:                                    (51)

     Finally, we impose market clearing. The trade balance equation (12) still ensures
market clearing for capital, while the market clearing condition for labor is now modi¯ed
to
                                                    pC ¢ c
                              1 ¡ l = (1 ¡ °) ¢ (1 ¡ ¿ ) ¢ ;                       (52)
                                                      w
where recall that l is employment in the R&D sector. This equation is identical to (39)
except that instead of ¹ workers employed to run ¯rms, we now have l workers employed
in the R&D sector.
     For simplicty, we consider only the steady state of this model. In this steady state
the rental rate r is still given by (15), and since world demand grows at the rate x¤ , we
     _ = x¤ . Using the trade balance equation (12) together with (15), and (50), we
have v=v
can rewrite the free entry condition (51) as

                                   ½¡±      ¿
                                       ¢ w = ¢ p1¡" ¢ Y:                                (53)
                                    ¸       "
This only di®ers from (38) in the previous subsection because of the term (½ ¡ ±)=¸ on the
left-hand side. This term incorporates the fact that labor costs are not costs for operating,
but R&D costs incurred only initially.
     Equation (53) implies that in steady state, income and wages have to grow at the same
rate. With a similar reasoning to that in the previous subsection, this is only consistent
with (52) if the amount of labor allocated to the R&D sector is constant. From (49), this
implies ¹_ = 0, that is, the steady-state number of varieties produced in each country is
constant and equal to
                                              ± ¢ ¹¤
                                         l¤ =        :
                                                ¸
Given the steady-state rental rate, (15), income di®erences across countries are once again
given by (46) in the previous subsection.
     More generally, the steady-state equilibrium is similar to that in the economy with
increasing returns in production. To maximize the parallel, let us normalize ±=¸ = 1. This
normalization implies that in both models, the steady-state number of workers employed


                                                31
in the consumption sector is 1 ¡ ¹¤ . With this assumption, we see immediately that
equation (48) from the previous subsection gives technology di®erences across countries.
   The intuition for why the number of varieties, ¹, does not grow with income is the
same as in the previous subsection: ¯xed costs of inventing new goods are in terms of
the scarce factor. So an increase in income causes a proportional increase in the wage
rate and ¯xed costs, raising the costs and pro¯ts from inventing new goods by an equal
amount. As a result, equilibrium distribution of ¹'s remains unchanged.
   This analysis also establishes that as long as ¯xed costs of production underpinning
specialization are in terms of the scarce factor, the general conclusions reached in the
previous three sections continue to hold irrespective of whether specialization is due to
increasing returns in production or endogenous technology di®erences. This implies that
whether countries share the same technology frontier or not is inessential to our results.

                               6     Concluding Remarks

This paper has presented a model of the world income distribution in which all countries
share the same long-run growth rate because of terms of trade e®ects. Countries that
accumulate faster supply more of the goods that they specialize in to the world and
experience worse terms of trade. This reduces the return to further accumulation and
creates a demand pull on other nations. We view this model as an attractive alternative
to the existing approaches where common long-run growth rates result only if all countries
share the same technology.
   Naturally, a theory of diminishing returns due to terms of trade e®ects does not pre-
clude diminishing returns in production or cross-country technological spillovers. It is
relatively straightforward|though cumbersome| to write down a model with all of these
factors present and complementing each other. The more important question is their rel-
ative contribution to explaining the actual world income distribution. Here, we made a
preliminary attempt at estimating the extent of terms of trade e®ects. Our results show
that when a country accumulating faster than others experiences a worsening in its terms
of trade. The estimated strength of the terms of trade e®ects is approximately of the
right order of magnitude to account for the observed cross-country di®erences in income
levels and speed of conditional convergence. Further empirical work on the importance of
terms of trade e®ects and how they in°uence cross-country income di®erences appears a
fruitful area for future research.

   Observations

            “Growth Rate of Terms of Trade” is measured as the annual growth rate of export prices minus the growth rate of import prices. The four
schooling variables and log of life expectancy at birth refer to 1965 values. The oil producer dummy is for 6 countries in our sample (Algeria, Indonesia,
Iran, Iraq, Jordan and Venezuela). The investment rate is the ratio of real domestic investment (private plus public) to real GDP, and the government
consumption is the ratio of real government consumption net of spending on defense and education to real GDP. Three continental dummies are defined
for Latin American, Sub-Saharan African and East Asian countries. The political instability variables include a dummy for countries that fought at least
one war over the period 1960-85, the average of the number of assassinations per million inhabitants per year and the number of revolutions per year, and
the average of the logarithm of the black market premium over the period 1965-85. Changes in years of schooling and log of life expectancy are between
1965 and 1985. All covariates in the second stage are also included in the first stage. Column 5 also includes dummies for sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia
and Latin America and column 6 includes the political instability variables, the war dummy, and the log of 1 plus the black market premium. These
covariates are not reported to save space. All data are from the Barro-Lee Data Set.
            Excluded instrument is log of output in 1965 in columns 1-9, while in column 10, excluded instruments are log of output in 1965, years of
schooling in 1965, and the log of life expectancy in 1965.
