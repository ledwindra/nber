    "abstract": "\n\nIn a model of data-driven firm competition, data are jointly produced by users, buying firms\u2019 services and contributing data, and firms, investing in data infrastructure and collection. Data collection improves services, benefiting users, but may reduce competition, harming users. Dispersed users do not internalize the impact of their data contribution on (i) service quality, (ii) competition, and (iii) firms\u2019 investment incentives, causing inefficient data over- or underinvestment. Unlike data sharing, user privacy protection policies, or data markets, a data union \u2014 which coordinates users\u2019 data contributions \u2014 or data trust \u2014 which intermediates data sales \u2014 can address these inefficiencies.\n\n",
