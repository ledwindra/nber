    "abstract": "\n\nPast work demonstrates that mandated prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) decrease opioid prescribing, but provides limited evidence on mechanisms. We analyze Kentucky\u2019s landmark PDMP mandate to disentangle the role of information versus hassle costs. PDMP mandates are meant to affect prescribing through information provision but may also unintentionally affect prescribing through the hassle cost of required record checks. On net, we find that although information clearly affected prescribing, hassle costs explain the majority of the decline in prescribing from this program. Hassle costs, however, did not deter physicians from prescribing opioids to the patients who would benefit the most\n\n",

We also thank Tom Chang, Guy David, Amol Navathe, Mark Pauly, David Powell and seminar participants at Mihaylo College of Business\u2019s at Cal State Fullerton, Claremont Graduate University, and the USC Leonard Davis School for helpful comments.
