JEL No. G1,G12
ABSTRACT
The Svensson generalization of the popular Nelson-Siegel term structure model is widely used by
practitioners and central banks. Unfortunately, like the original Nelson-Siegel specification, this generalization,
in its dynamic form, does not enforce arbitrage-free consistency over time. Indeed, we show that the
factor loadings of the Svensson generalization cannot be obtained in a standard finance arbitrage-free
affine term structure representation. Therefore, we introduce a closely related generalized Nelson-Siegel
model on which the no-arbitrage condition can be imposed. We estimate this new arbitrage-free generalized
Nelson-Siegel model and demonstrate its tractability and good in-sample fit.

Introduction

To investigate yield-curve dynamics, researchers have produced a vast literature with a wide variety
of models. Many of these models assume that at observed bond prices there are no remaining
unexploited opportunities for riskless arbitrage. This theoretical assumption is consistent with the
observation that bonds of various maturities all trade simultaneously in deep and liquid markets.
Rational traders in such markets should enforce a consistency in the yields of various bonds
across diﬀerent maturities–the yield curve at any point in time–and the expected path of those
yields over time–the dynamic evolution of the yield curve. Indeed, the assumption that there
are no remaining arbitrage opportunities is central to the enormous finance literature devoted to
the empirical analysis of bond pricing. Unfortunately, as noted by Duﬀee (2002), the associated
arbitrage-free (AF) models can demonstrate disappointing empirical performance, especially with
regard to out-of-sample forecasting. In addition, the estimation of these models is problematic,
in large part because of the existence of numerous model likelihood maxima that have essentially
identical fit to the data but very diﬀerent implications for economic behavior (Kim and Orphanides,
2005).1
In contrast to the popular finance arbitrage-free models, many other researchers have employed
representations that are empirically appealing but not well grounded in theory. Most notably, the
Nelson-Siegel (1987) curve provides a remarkably good fit to the cross section of yields in many
countries and has become a widely used specification among financial market practitioners and
central banks. Moreover, Diebold and Li (2006) develop a dynamic model based on this curve and
show that it corresponds exactly to a modern factor model, with yields that are aﬃne in three
latent factors, which have a standard interpretation of level, slope, and curvature. Such a dynamic
Nelson-Siegel (DNS) model is easy to estimate and forecasts the yield curve quite well. Despite its
good empirical performance, however, the DNS model does not impose the presumably desirable
theoretical restriction of absence of arbitrage (e.g., Filipović, 1999, and Diebold, Piazzesi, and
Rudebusch, 2005).
In Christensen, Diebold, and Rudebusch (2007), henceforth CDR, we show how to reconcile the
Nelson-Siegel model with the absence of arbitrage by deriving an aﬃne AF model that maintains
the Nelson-Siegel factor loading structure for the yield curve. This arbitrage-free Nelson-Siegel
(AFNS) model combines the best of both yield-curve modeling traditions. Although it maintains
the theoretical restrictions of the aﬃne AF modeling tradition, the Nelson-Siegel structure helps
identify the latent yield-curve factors, so the AFNS model can be easily and robustly estimated.
Furthermore, our results show that the AFNS model exhibits superior empirical forecasting performance.
In this paper, we consider some important generalizations of the Nelson-Siegel yield curve that
are also widely used in central banks and industry (e.g., De Pooter, 2007).2 Foremost among
these is the Svensson (1995) extension to the Nelson-Siegel curve, which is used at the Federal
1 A further failing is that the aﬃne arbitrage-free finance models oﬀer little insight into the economic nature
of the underlying forces that drive movements in interest rates. This issue has been addressed by a burgeoning
macro-finance literature, which is described in Rudebusch and Wu (2007, 2008).
2 Alternative flexible parameterizations of the yield curve include the use of Legendre polynomials (as in Almeida
and Vicente, 2008) and natural cubic splines (as in Bowsher and Meeks, 2008).

Coroneo, Nyholm, and Vidova-Koleva, 2008), and many other central banks (see Söderlind and
Svensson, 1997, and Bank for International Settlements, 2005). The Svensson extension adds a
second curvature term, which allows for a better fit at long maturities. Following Diebold and
Li (2006), we first introduce a dynamic version of this model, which corresponds to a modern
four-factor term structure model. Unfortunately, we show that it is not possible to obtain an
arbitrage-free “approximation” to this model in the sense of obtaining analytically identical factor
loadings for the four factors. Intuitively, such an approximation requires that each curvature
factor must be paired with a slope factor that has the same mean-reversion rate. This pairing
is simply not possible for the Svensson extension, which has one slope factor and two curvature
factors. Therefore, to obtain an arbitrage-free generalization of the Nelson-Siegel curve, we add a
second slope factor to pair with the second curvature factor. The simple dynamic version of this
model is a generalized version of the DNS model. We also show that the result in CDR can be
extended to obtain an arbitrage-free approximation to that five-factor model, which we refer to as
the arbitrage-free generalized Nelson-Siegel (AFGNS) model.
Finally, we show that this new AFGNS model of the yield curve not only displays theoretical consistency but also retains the important properties of empirical tractability and fit. We
estimate the independent-factor versions of the four-factor and five-factor non-AF models and
the independent-factor version of the five-factor arbitrage-free AFGNS model. We compare the
results to those obtained by CDR for the DNS and AFNS models and find good in-sample fit for
the AFGNS model.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the DNS model
and its arbitrage-free equivalent as derived in CDR. Section 3 contains the description of the
arbitrage-free generalized Nelson-Siegel model. Section 4 describes the five specific models that
we analyze, while Section 5 describes the data, estimation method, and estimation results. Section
6 concludes the paper, and an appendix contains some additional technical details.

Nelson-Siegel term structure models

In this section, we review the DNS and AFNS models that maintain the Nelson-Siegel factor
loading structure.

2.1

The dynamic Nelson-Siegel model

The Nelson-Siegel curve fits the term structure of interest rates at any point in time with the
simple functional form
y(τ ) = β0 + β1 (

1 − e−λτ
1 − e−λτ
) + β2 (
− e−λτ ),
λτ
λτ

(1)

where y(τ ) is the zero-coupon yield with τ denoting the time to maturity, and β0 , β1 , β2 , and λ
are model parameters.3
3 This

is equation (2) in Nelson and Siegel (1987).

2

As many have noted, this representation is able to provide a good fit to the cross section of
yields at a given point in time, and this is a key reason for its popularity with financial market
practitioners. Still, to understand the evolution of the bond market over time, a dynamic representation is required. Diebold and Li (2006) supply such a model by replacing the parameters
with time-varying factors
yt (τ ) = Lt + St (

1 − e−λτ
1 − e−λτ
) + Ct (
− e−λτ ).
λτ
λτ

(2)

Given their associated Nelson-Siegel factor loadings, Diebold and Li show that Lt , St , and Ct can
be interpreted as level, slope, and curvature factors. Furthermore, once the model is viewed as a
factor model, a dynamic structure can be postulated for the three factors, which yields a dynamic
Nelson-Siegel (DNS) model.
Despite its good empirical performance, however, the DNS model does not impose absence of
arbitrage (e.g., Filipović, 1999, and Diebold, Piazzesi, and Rudebusch, 2005). This problem was
solved in CDR, where we derived the aﬃne arbitrage-free class of dynamic Nelson-Siegel term
structure models, referred to as the AFNS model in the remainder of this paper.

2.2

The arbitrage-free Nelson-Siegel model

The derivation in CDR of the class of AFNS models starts from the standard continuous-time
aﬃne arbitrage-free term structure model. In this framework, we consider a three-factor model
with a constant volatility matrix, that is, in the terminology of the canonical characterization of
aﬃne term structure models provided by Dai and Singleton (2000), we start with the A0 (3) class
of term structure models. Within the A0 (3) class, CDR prove the following proposition.
Proposition 2.1. Assume that the instantaneous risk-free rate is defined by
rt = Xt1 + Xt2 .
In addition, assume that the state variables Xt = (Xt1 , Xt2 , Xt3 ) are described by the following
system of stochastic diﬀerential equations (SDEs) under the risk-neutral Q-measure:

This result has two implications. First, the fact that zero-coupon bond yields in the AFNS class
of models are given by an analytical formula greatly facilitates empirical implementation of these
models. Second, the nine underlying volatility parameters are not identified. Indeed, only the six
terms A, B, C, D, E, and F can be identified; thus, the maximally flexible AFNS specification
that can be identified has a triangular volatility matrix given by5

Extensions of the Nelson-Siegel model

The main in-sample problem with the regular Nelson-Siegel yield curve is that, for reasonable
choices of λ (which are empirically in the range from 0.5 to 1 for U.S. Treasury yield data),
the factor loading for the slope and the curvature factor decay rapidly to zero as a function of
maturity. Thus, only the level factor is available to fit yields with maturities of ten years or
longer. In empirical estimation, this limitation shows up as a lack of fit of the long-term yields,
as described in CDR.
To address this problem in fitting the cross section of yields, Svensson (1995) introduced an
extended version of the Nelson-Siegel yield curve with an additional curvature factor,
y(τ ) = β1 + β2

³ 1 − e−λ1 τ ´
λ1 τ

+ β3

³ 1 − e−λ1 τ
λ1 τ

´
³ 1 − e−λ2 τ
´
− e−λ1 τ + β4
− e−λ2 τ .
λ2 τ

Just as Diebold and Li (2006) replaced the three β coeﬃcients with dynamic factors in the regular
Nelson-Siegel model, we can replace the four β coeﬃcients in the Svensson model with dynamic
processes (Lt , St , Ct1 , Ct2 ) interpreted as a level, a slope, and two curvature factors, respectively.
Thus, the dynamic factor model representation of the Svensson yield curve, which we label the
DNSS model, is given by
yt (τ ) = Lt + St

³ 1 − e−λ1 τ ´
λ1 τ

+ Ct1

³ 1 − e−λ1 τ
λ1 τ

´
³ 1 − e−λ2 τ
´
− e−λ1 τ + Ct2
− e−λ2 τ ,
λ2 τ

along with the processes describing factor dynamics. The factor loadings of the four state variables
in the yield function of the DNSS model are illustrated in Figure 1(a) with λ1 and λ2 set equal to
our estimates described in Section 5.
The critique raised by Filipović (1999) against the dynamic version of the Nelson-Siegel model
also applies to the dynamic version of the Svensson model introduced in this paper. Thus, this
model is not consistent with the concept of absence of arbitrage. Ideally, we would like to repeat
the work in CDR and derive an arbitrage-free approximation to the DNSS model. However, from
the mechanics of Proposition 2.1 for the arbitrage-free approximation of the regular Nelson-Siegel
model, it is clear that we can only obtain the Nelson-Siegel factor loading structure for the slope
and curvature factors under two specific conditions. First, each pair of slope and curvature factors
must have identical own mean-reversion rates. Second, the impact of deviations in the curvature
factor from its mean on the slope factor must be scaled with a factor equal to that own meanreversion rate (λ). Thus, it is impossible in an arbitrage-free model to generate the factor loading
structure of two curvature factors with only one slope factor. Consequently, it is impossible to
create an arbitrage-free version of the Svensson extension to the Nelson-Siegel model that has
factor loadings analytically identical to the ones in the DNSS model.
However, this discussion suggests that we can create a generalized AF Nelson-Siegel model by
including a fifth factor in the form of a second slope factor. The yield function of this model takes

This dynamic generalized Nelson-Siegel model, which we denote as the DGNS model, is a fivefactor model with one level factor, two slope factors, and two curvature factors. (Note that we
impose the restriction that λ1 > λ2 , which is nonbinding due to symmetry.6 ) The factor loadings
of the five state variables in the yield function of the DGNS model are illustrated in Figure 1(b)

A straightforward extension of Proposition 2.1 delivers the arbitrage-free approximation of this

Five specific Nelson-Siegel models

In general, all the models considered in this paper are silent about the P -dynamics, and an infinite
number of possible specifications could be used to match the data. However, for continuity with
the existing literature, our econometric analysis focuses on independent-factor versions of the five
diﬀerent models we have described. These models include the DNS and AFNS models from CDR
and the generalized DNSS, DGNS, and AFGNS models introduced in Section 3.
In the independent-factor DNS model, all three state variables are assumed to be independent
first-order autoregressions, as in Diebold and Li (2006). Using their notation, the state equation
7 The analytical formula for the yield-adjustment term in the AFGNS model is provided in Appendix A. As was
the case for Proposition 2.1, Proposition 3.2 is also silent about the P -dynamics of the state variables, so to identify
the model, we follow CDR and fix the mean under the Q-measure at zero, i.e., θQ = 0.

The corresponding AFNS model is formulated in continuous time and the relationship between
the real-world dynamics under the P -measure and the risk-neutral dynamics under the Q-measure
is given by the measure change
dWtQ = dWtP + Γt dt,
where Γt represents the risk premium specification. To preserve aﬃne dynamics under the P measure, we limit our focus to essentially aﬃne risk premium specifications (see Duﬀee, 2002).

With this specification, the SDE for the state variables under the P -measure,

and mean-reversion matrix K P under the P -measure and still preserve the required Q-dynamic
structure described in Proposition 2.1. Therefore, we focus on the independent-factor AFNS model,
which corresponds to the specific DNS model from earlier in this section and assumes all three
factors are independent under the P -measure

Data

Our data are monthly observations on U.S. Treasury security yields covering the period from
January 1987 to December 2002 (and also used in CDR). The data are end-of-month, unsmoothed
Fama-Bliss zero-coupon yields for 16 diﬀerent maturities that range from three months to 30 years.
Summary statistics of the yields are provided in Table 1, which lists the 16 maturities. Figure 2
displays the time series for the three-month, two-year, and ten-year yields.

5.2

Estimation method

All 16 maturities are used throughout. Since the five models are aﬃne Gaussian, we estimate
them by maximizing the likelihood function in the standard Kalman filter algorithm which is an
eﬃcient and consistent estimator in this setting (see Harvey, 1989). A separate advantage of the
Kalman filter is that it lets the data speak on which maturities are fitted the best by each model.
Thus, we avoid identifying the factors of the models by assuming a corresponding number of yields
are observed without error as is done, for example, in Duﬀee (2002). This is important for our
analysis as we are comparing models with a varying number of factors and focus on the in-sample
fit of the entire yield curve.
For the DNS, DNSS, and DGNS models, the state equation is

the measurement equation is given by
yt = BXt + εt .
Following Diebold, Rudebusch, and Aruoba (2006), we start the algorithm at the unconditional
mean and variance of the state variables. This assumes the state variables are stationary, which
is imposed with the constraint that the eigenvalues of A are smaller than 1.
For the continuous-time AFNS and AFGNS models, the conditional mean vector and the
conditional covariance matrix are given by
E P [XT |Ft ] = (I − exp(−K P ∆t))θP + exp(−K P ∆t)Xt ,
Z ∆t

V P [XT |Ft ] =

where ∆t = T − t. By discretizing the continuous dynamics under the P -measure, we obtain the

state equation

Xi = (I − exp(−K P ∆ti ))θP + exp(−K P ∆ti )Xi−1 + ηt ,
where ∆ti = ti − ti−1 is the time between observations. The conditional covariance matrix for the

DNSS model estimation results

Table 2 presents the estimated mean-reversion matrix A and the estimated vector of mean parameters μ, along with the estimated parameters of the conditional covariance matrix Q obtained for
the DNSS model. The results reveal that the slope factor is the most persistent factor. Also, the
relatively large standard deviations of the estimated mean parameters suggest some diﬃculty in
pinning down their value under the P -measure, which is likely related to the fairly high persistence
of the state variables (e.g., Kim and Orphanides, 2005). The λ1 parameter is estimated at 0.838,
which implies a factor loading for the first curvature factor that peaks near the two-year maturity.
The estimated value of λ2 is 0.097, so the factor loading of the second curvature factor reaches
its maximum near the 19-year maturity. (These are illustrated in Figure 1(a).) Clearly, the two
curvature factors take on very diﬀerent roles in the fit of the model.

The level factor has the smallest volatility, and the two curvature factors are the most volatile,
similar to the CDR results for the DNS model.
In Figure 3, we compare the estimated level, slope, and first curvature factors in the DNSS
model to the corresponding factors estimated by CDR for the independent-factor DNS model. The
correlations for these three factors across the two models are 0.553, 0.844, and 0.899, respectively.
Thus, only the level factor changes notably when the second curvature factor is added to the
model. Intuitively, without the second curvature factor, only the level factor is able to fit the
long-term yields. However, the second curvature factor can fit yields with maturities in the 10to 30-year range, so when it is included, the level factor is allowed to fit other areas of the yield
curve.
Figure 4 shows the second curvature factor. The purpose of this factor is to improve the fit
of long-term yields, and there is a clear relationship between it and the ten-year yield (with a
correlation coeﬃcient of 0.793). The second curvature factor also inherits the downward trend
observed in long-term yields over this sample period, while the DNSS level factor starts to look
more stationary.
Table 3 reports summary statistics for the fitted errors of all five models. With its additional
flexibility, the DNSS model does show some improvement in fit over the DNS model, especially
in the maturity range from three months to eight years. There is also a slightly better DNSS
model fit with long-term yields, which is consistent with the second curvature factor operating

at long maturities. However, Figure 5, which displays the fit of all five models on four specific
dates,9 shows that at times the DNSS model still does not fit the long end of the yield curve very
well. Indeed, since the factor loading of the second curvature factor is practically flat in the 10- to
30-year maturity range, it can only provide a level diﬀerence between the shorter end of the yield
curve and the very long end of the curve, but it cannot fit deviations between the 10-, 15-, 20-,
and 30-year yields.
The fitted errors reported in Table 3 for the DNSS model can be compared loosely to the
errors reported by Gürkaynak, Sack, and Wright (2007), who use the Svensson yield curve to fit

see a significant change in the estimated mean-reversion rates after this addition. Overall, though,
all the factors have become less persistent than what we observed in the DNSS model.
For the estimated mean parameters we find little change after adding the second slope factor
to the model. If anything, it seems like the uncertainty about these parameters has declined
notably. This ties in well with the fact that the factors have become less persistent, which allows
the estimation to determine their means more precisely.
For the independent-factor DGNS model, the estimated q-parameters translate into a onemonth conditional covariance matrix given by

This matrix shows that for the level factor and the two curvature factors the estimated volatilities
are now smaller than the ones reported in Equation (9) for the DNSS model. In contrast, the
estimated volatilities of the two slope factors are notably higher than the one reported for the
single slope factor in the DNSS model.
The estimated values of λ1 and λ2 , which are 1.19 and 0.102, respectively, are also of interest.
The estimated value of λ1 is higher than the estimate of 0.838 obtained for the DNSS model, which
implies that the factor loadings of the first slope and curvature factors decay to zero at a more
rapid pace. Thus, as illustrated in Figure 1(b), movements in these two factors will have a limited
impact on yields beyond the five-year maturity. However, that lack of influence is made up for by
the second slope factor. The low estimate of λ2 implies that this factor has a loading that decays
very slowly. Therefore, this factor can aﬀect the important intermediate range of maturities from

In Figure 6, we compare the level, the first slope, and the first curvature factors in the DGNS
model to the corresponding factors obtained for the DNS model (from CDR) and the DNSS model
(described earlier in this section). The correlations of these three factors across the DNS and
DGNS models are 0.730, 0.804, and 0.793, respectively. For the DNS and DNSS models, the
correlations are 0.549, 0.821, and 0.949, respectively. Thus, while the level factor is aﬀected by
the addition of a second curvature factor, as in the DNSS model, the impact of a second slope
factor, as in the DGNS model, is more limited. Also, the first slope and curvature factors have

very similar sample paths across all three models. Given the fairly large estimated values of λ1 in
all three models, the factor loadings of these two factors decay towards zero relatively rapidly as
a function of maturity, so their roles in fitting the shorter end of the yield curve are well defined.

second slope factor appears to be a stationary process with a fairly high rate of mean-reversion,
but its intuition is not obvious.
If we focus on the fit of the DGNS model in Table 3, we see fairly uniform improvement in
the fit in the maturity range from three months to ten years and a dramatic improvement in
the fit of the 30-year yield. The improved fit for the long yield in the DGNS model relative to
the DNSS model reflects the presence of the second slope factor and is also visible in Figure 5 .
However, there is still no improvement for the 15- or 20-year yields, a deficiency that can perhaps
be alleviated by imposing the AF restrictions.

Compared to the estimated A matrix reported for the DGNS model in Table 4, this shows that
by imposing an absence of arbitrage on that model, the level and two curvature factors become
notably less persistent, while the two slope factors become more persistent.

Across the board, the volatility of each factor is notably higher in the AFGNS model than in the
corresponding non-AF DGNS model.
The estimated AFGNS values of λ1 and λ2 are 1.01 and 0.234, compared with the DGNS values
of 1.19 and 0.1016. The lower value of λ1 implies that the first slope and curvature factors decay

somewhat slower to zero than in the DGNS model, while the higher value of λ2 indicates that the
model is using the additional yield-adjustment term to get the level of the long-term yields right,
which eases the tension on the second curvature factor. This shows up as a much larger estimate
for λ2 .
Figure 8 displays the estimated paths for the level, first slope, and first curvature factors in the
AFGNS model and the earlier models. The correlations for these three factors across the AFGNS
and DGNS models are 0.692, 0.668, and 0.952, respectively. Thus, for the level and first slope
factors, the imposition of an absence of arbitrage leads to some changes.10
1 0 Note that, with the inclusion of the yield-adjustment term in the yield function of the AFGNS model, the
estimated values of all five factors are rescaled relative to the estimated values obtained in the DGNS model (and
reflected in the mean parameter estimates as well).

Figure 9: Second Slope and Second Curvature Factors in the AFGNS Model.
The estimated second slope and curvature factors for the independent-factor AFGNS model are
shown with corresponding estimated paths from the DNSS and DGNS models for comparison.

Figure 9 illustrates the second slope and curvature factors and the eﬀect of the increase in
the estimated value of λ2 . Figure 9(a) shows that there is a notable change in the path of the
second slope factor in the AFGNS model relative to the DGNS model, and the two paths show
a correlation of only 0.046. There is greater correlation between the AFGNS and DGNS second
curvature factors (of 0.696), as depicted in Figure 9(b).
Focusing on the fit of the AFGNS model in Table 3, it is clear that the AFGNS model provides
a more balanced fit across maturities than the DNSS model. Indeed, only the 30-year yield does
not really benefit from adding the second slope factor or the AF restrictions. There are also
benefits relative to the DGNS model, especially on the four specific dates studied in Figure 5
when the improvement in the fit of the 15- and 20-year yields obtained with the AFGNS model
is quite apparent. The increase in the maximum log likelihood value from 16816.08 to 16982.52
from the imposition of the AF restrictions also indicates that the overall fit of the model has been
improved notably.
The only diﬀerence between the DGNS and the AFGNS models is tied to the yield-adjustment
)
term, − C(τ
τ , which is a maturity-dependent function that appears in the yield function as a

result of the imposition of absence of arbitrage and is a consequence of convexity eﬀects. Figure

10 displays the AFNS yield-adjustment term from CDR (and its three subcomponents) and the
AFGNS yield-adjustment term (and its five subcomponents).11 These two yield adjustments have
similar shapes but a somewhat diﬀerent scale. In the AFNS model, the yield-adjustment term
stays below 50 basis points even at the 30-year maturity, while in the AFGNS model it reaches a
full 3 percentage points at that same maturity. The AFGNS model uses the large negative values
1 1 As long as we only consider models with diagonal volatility matrices, the yield-adjustment term will be a
negative, monotonically decreasing function of maturity that will eventually converge to −∞ due to the level factor
imposed in the Nelson-Siegel model.

Conclusion

The Nelson-Siegel (1987) curve and the associated dynamic DNS model of Diebold and Li (2006)
both have trouble fitting long-maturity yields (in large part because of convexity eﬀects). In this
paper, we solve that problem while simultaneously imposing an absence of arbitrage. We argue
that although the popular Svensson (1995) extension of the Nelson-Siegel curve may improve
long-maturity fit, there does not exist an arbitrage-free yield-curve model that matches its factor
loadings. However, we show that there is a natural five-factor generalization, which adds a second
slope factor to join the additional curvature factor in the Svesson extension, that does achieve
freedom from arbitrage. Finally, we show that the estimation of this new AFGNS model is tractable
and provides good fit to the yield curve. The empirical tractability is especially important because,
as noted in the introduction, it would be very diﬃcult to estimate the maximally flexible five-factor
aﬃne arbitrage-free term structure model.
Going forward, the AFGNS model may be a useful addition to the tool kit of central banks
and practitioners who now use the non-AF Svensson extension of the Nelson-Seigel yield curve.
Furthermore, we envision much future research that employs the underlying arbitrage-free NelsonSeigel structure. In particular, given its tractable estimation, the basic AFNS model can be easily
extended to incorporate other elements, such as stochastic volatility, inflation-indexed bond yields,
or interbank lending rates (Christensen, Lopez, and Rudebusch, 2008a, b, c). These extensions
would be diﬃcult to include in an estimated maximally flexible aﬃne model but may help illumi-
