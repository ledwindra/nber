Homework in Monetary Economics: Inflation, Home Production, and the Production of Homes

ABSTRACT
We study models incorporating money, household production, and investment in housing. Inflation,
as a tax on market activity, encourages substitution into household production, and thus investment
in household capital. Hence, inflation increases the (appropriately deflated) value of the housing stock.
This is documented in various data sources. A calibrated model accounts for a fifth to a half of the
observed relationships. While this leaves much to be explained, it demonstrates the channel is economically
relevant. We also show models with home production imply higher costs of inflation than models
without it, especially when home and market goods are close substitutes.

It is sometimes heard that housing is a good hedge against inflation. Is this true? And,
if so, one might ask where and when — i.e., in what countries and time periods — and of
course, one might want to know why? To address these issues we think that one needs to
look carefully at the data, build a rigorous theoretical model, and apply it quantitatively.
This paper presents the results of our eﬀorts in that endeavor.
Using various data sources, mainly for the U.S., although we also look at other countries,
we find that appropriately deflated values of the housing stock are positively related to both
inflation and nominal interest rates. While one may be able to think of diﬀerent ways to
interpret this fact, we pursue the following idea. In any reasonable monetary model, inflation
is a tax on market activity as long as cash is used in at least some market transactions.
Thus, inflation leads agents to substitute out of market and into nonmarket activity, and in
particular into household production — e.g., when inflation is higher, people go out less and
eat more meals at home, given that going out is cash intensive. Of course not all market
activity uses cash, but it uses cash more than household production, since home-produced
goods (like home-cooked meals) are generally not even traded, let alone traded using currency.
Hence, inflation increases demand for inputs to household production, including time, and
also capital, such as appliances and housing itself. In this way, inflation increases the value
of the housing stock — perhaps mostly through prices in the short run, and more in quantities
as supply catches up, but either way it increases.
We formalize this reasoning by integrating the literature on the microfoundations of
monetary exchange, the literature incorporating household production into macro, and the
literature that models housing explicitly.1 This is motivated by much previous work showing
that incorporating home production into otherwise standard nonmonetary macro models has
1

For surveys on the microfoundations of monetary economics, see Nosal and Rocheteau (2011) or
Williamson and Wright (2010); our setup is closest to Aruoba et al. (2011), which is a generalization
of Lagos and Wright (2005). As an independent contribution to monetary economics, this is the first paper
we know that builds an explicit retail sector into the framework. On home production, there are surveys by
Greenwood et al. (1995) and Gronau (1997), but we review many of the more recent contributions below.
We also review some of the literature on housing; as a preview, we follow Davis and Heathcote (2005).

significant eﬀects.2 We use our setup to formalize the economic intuition described above, to
organize the empirical findings, and to measure the eﬀects of inflation. The last application
is natural, since it is well known that home production models can give diﬀerent quantitative
answers, compared to models without home production, to other policy questions. We want
to see if it makes a diﬀerence for a classic monetary policy question: what is the cost of
anticipated inflation?
In our theory, housing capital is valued as an input to household production, like market
capital is valued as an input to market production in standard macro. We first prove several
analytic results, then ask how well calibrated versions of the model capture the empirical
findings. The model accounts for a sizable fraction, but not all, of the relationship between
appropriately deflated measures of value of the housing stock, on the one hand, and inflation
or nominal interest rates, on the other, while matching several additional observations of
interest. To be precise, we can account for between a fifth to a half of the key relationships, depending on details. While this leaves a significant amount to be explained by other
channels, it demonstrates that the eﬀect we isolate is economically relevant. We also show
that models with home production imply a higher cost of inflation than models without it,
especially when home and market goods are relatively close substitutes,
In terms of other work, several papers study the relation between stock markets and
inflation, which is similar in that equity and housing are both assets (see Geromichalos et
al. 2007 for references). Other papers analyze house prices and inflation explicitly through

2

By way of example, Benhabib et al. (1991) and Greenwood and Hercowicz (1991) put the ideas of Becker
(1965,1988) into dynamic general equilibrium, and show models with home production do a better job than
otherwise similar models matching key business-cycle moments. It has been shown that such models also
account better for consumption (Baxter and Jerrmann 1999; Baxter 2010; Aguiar and Hurst 2005,2007a),
investment (Gomme et al. 2001; Fisher 1997,2007), female labor-force participation (Greenwood et al. 2005;
House et al 2008; Albanesi and Olivetti 2009), and labor supply generally, including retirement and other
life-cycle issues (Rios-Rull 1993; Rupert et al. 2000; Gomme et al. 2004; Aguiar and Hurst 2007b; Ngai and
Pissarides 2008; Rogerson and Wallenius 2009). Home production models give diﬀerent answers to certain
policy questions, such as the impact of taxation (McGrattan et al. 1997; Rogerson 2009). They also do a
better job accounting for international diﬀerences in income, and provide a diﬀerent perspective on growth
and development (Einarsson and Marquis 1997; Parente et al. 2000).

the eﬀects on mortgages, including Kearl (1979), Follain (1982) and Poterba (1991). These
are complementary ideas, but we focus on diﬀerent channels. Brunnermeier and Juiliard
(2008) in particular assume “money illusion” where agents confound nominal and real interest
rates, which may ring true, but we want to see how far we can get with rational agents.
An innovative recent paper by Burnside et al. (2011) also studies housing markets with
departures from standard rational expectations assumptions, but again we want to see how
far we can get without this. He et al. (2011) show how housing can bear a liquidity premium,
because home equity can be used to collateralize loans. We are after diﬀerent issues, and
abstract from home equity loans. As we remark below, this suggests concentrating on data
prior to 2000, before the use of home equity loans rose dramatically, but we still show data
pre- and post-2000. Similar in spirit is work by Piazessi and Schneider (2010), who study how
portfolios adjust when inflation taxes returns to financial assets but not housing. In terms
of diﬀerentiating our product, we incorporate household production explicitly, allowing us
to take advantage of many theoretical and empirical results in home production research.3
Section 1 discusses the data. Section 2 presents the theoretical framework, and Section 3
defines equilibrium. Section 4 presents a simplified version of the model and derives analytic
results. Section 5 presents the numerical analysis. Section 6 concludes.

Data

Here we make the case that the value of home capital, scaled by either nominal output or the
money supply, is positively related to inflation and nominal interest rates. We obviously have
to scale by something, to correct for purely nominal increases in value, and we emphasize
that our theory is about more than the idea that inflation makes prices go up. Our model
3

Also, we mention here that although our model has frictional goods markets, housing is traded in
frictionsless markets, just like capital is traded in standard growth theory. The growing body of research
on frictional housing markets includes Wheaton (1990), Albrecht et al. (2007), Caplin and Leahy (2008),
Coulson and Fisher (2009), Ngai and Tenreyro (2009), Novy-Marx (2009), Piazzesi and Schneider (2009),
and Head and Lloyd-Ellis (2010).

predicts the value of home capital over nominal output, and of home capital over the money
supply, both increase with inflation or nominal interest rates. We first show this is true
in the U.S., then examine other countries. We consider several measures of the value of
home capital, each defined by an estimate of housing wealth (price times quantity), plus
the stock of durable goods from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). We add durables
since we think of home capital more broadly than just housing, even if housing is the biggest
component — i.e., around 75%. We describe the diﬀerent approaches to measuring housing
wealth in some detail here, but more information on data sources is given in the Appendix.

1.1

United States

Our first estimate of housing wealth uses data from Davis and Heathcote (2007), DH for short.
This is a relatively short sample, starting in 1975, but provides a very accurate measure.
Figure 1 shows time series and color-coded scatter plots for home capital over nominal output
vs inflation and vs the nominal interest rate, as well as home capital over the money supply
vs inflation and vs the nominal rate. Our measure of output is GDP minus rents paid to
housing services, as in related studies on home production. Our measure of money is the
M1S series that adjusts M1 for the practice of banks since the 1990s of “sweeping” checkable
deposits into overnight money market accounts (Cynamon et al. 2006). For inflation we use
the appropriately adjusted GDP deflator, and for the nominal rate here we use T-bills. We
consider both inflation and interest rates, even though the Fisher Equation predicts they
should move together in theory, because they do not cohere perfectly in practice. Figure 1
also reports correlations, and semi-elasticities computed from regressing of the log of home
capital over GDP or home capital over M1S on inflation or interest rates. The black line
shows the predicted relationship 1975-1999, and the blue line shows it 2000-2009.
It is apparent that something unusual — the housing bubble — happens in the 2000s relative
to the previous 25 years. Unlike some of the work mentioned in the Introduction, we do not

4

have much to say in this paper about the post-2000 U.S. housing boom and bust, and there
may well have been something going on that our model is not designed to capture (see, e.g.,
Burnside et al. 2011, Mian and Sufi 2011, He et al. 2011 and references therein). Therefore
it may be reasonable to concentrate more on “normal” times, by ending the sample at 1999,
but we do not want to hide anything, and so we still show what happened after 2000. From
1975 to 1999, home capital over GDP and home capital over M1S are obviously positively
correlated with both inflation and interest rates. This is also true after 2000, but that decade
simply looks diﬀerent. Over the whole sample, 1975-2009, there is not much of a correlation,
but not because there is no relationship — rather, because the positive relationship rotates
or shifts, depending on whether we look at inflation or interest rates.
Our second measure of housing wealth uses data from the Flow of Funds Accounts (FFA).
An advantage of FAA data is that they go back to 1952, although as is common in macro we
prefer to start in 1955, post Korean war. In any case, we believe FFA data do not provide
the best estimates of the house values in 1975-1990, which is a key period for our analysis
because it has a lot of variation in inflation. This is because the housing capital gains implied
by the FFA data in this period do not align well with capital gains computed using standard
price indexes. Unlike the DH data, where capital gains are taken directly from price indexes,
for this period FFA data spline together estimates from various surveys. With this caveat
in mind we show the results in Figure 2. There little correlation between home capital over
GDP and inflation prior to 2000, although the relationship is positive after 2000, and it
is positive in both periods for home capital over GDP and interest rates. The correlation
between home capital over M1S and either inflation or interest rates is also positive in both
periods, and again one can see a rotation or shift post 2000. So, even if we are less confident
in this data, the basic pattern is similar.
Our third measure is based on the replacement cost of structures estimated by the BEA,
as used in, e.g., McGrattan et al. (1997). A disadvantage of these data is that they do not

5

include the value of land, which prior to 1970 was between 10 to 20 percent and is currently
about a third of aggregate housing value (Davis and Heathcote 2007). The advantage is that
they are constructed according to well-documented methods, and go back to the 1930s. It
is not clear, however, what to make of data that far back, where the situation is confounded
by the Great Depression, as well as some swings in inflation having to do with price controls
and wars. Given these caveats, Figure 3 shows the BEA data.4 In this case the regression
lines come from splitting the sample between 1930-1954 and 1955-1999 (although we show
the data to 2009). For home capital over GDP vs inflation, the relationship in the latter
(earlier) period is slightly positive (negative) For home capital over GDP vs interest rates,
the correlation is positive in both subsamples. For home capital over M1S vs inflation the
relationship in the latter (earlier) period is strongly positive (slightly negative). For home
capital over M1S vs interest rates, the relationship between home capital over M1S and
interest rates is remarkably strong in both periods, with correlation coeﬃcients around 0.9.
Our fourth and final measure of housing wealth is computed directly from the Decennial
Censuses of Housing (DCH). The advantages are that these numbers are very accurate,
and go back to 1930, although of course we have only one observation every 10 years, so
we interpolate between data points. In Figure 4, the regression lines in the scatters are
from splitting the sample between 1930-1954 and 1955-1999. For home capital over GDP vs
inflation, again the relationship in the latter (earlier) period is slightly positive (negative).
For home capital over GDP vs interest rates it is always positive. For home capital over
M1S vs inflation the relationship is positive (slightly negative) in the latter (earlier) period.
For home capital vs the nominal interest rate the relationship is again remarkably strong in
both periods.5 We are mostly interested in what happens post 1955, and do not have a lot
4

Since here we go back to the 1930s, the interest rate uses AAA corporate bonds. If we use these instead
of T-bill rates for Figures 1 and 2, there is little change before 2000, although there is some change after
2000 (which is not too surprising given so few post-2000 observations).
5
We remark that the relationship between housing and interest rates is generally more clear than the
relationship between housing and inflation. One reason may be that nominal rates better reflect perceptions
of long-term inflation than actual reported inflation rates, especially in periods with price controls.

6

to say about the Depression, major wars or price controls. Once we move past those events
there is a clear relationship between the variables in question.
To make one more point, Figure 5 shows Shiller’s (2005) house price index (HPI) series,
focusing on post-1955. Over this period, HPI declines secularly relative to GDP and M1S,
rendering correlations uninformative. More importantly, Table 1 reconciles decade-by-decade
changes in HPI and housing wealth. Column 1 reports HPI growth; Column 2 reports growth
in the average price of housing units; Column 3 reports growth in the number of units; and
Column 4 reports growth in nominal GDP. The percentage change in the value of housing
is approximately Column 2 plus Column 3. Columns 1 and 2 show average prices increase
faster than the HPI in every decade. This is because Shiller’s data holds housing quality
constant, and the gap between Columns 1 and 2 reflects quality improvement. Also, Shiller’s
data do not track changes in the number of units, which increased rapidly over the period
(Column 3). To sum up, Columns 2 and 3 show the change in housing wealth between 1950
and 2000 is 528 percent, about the same the 517 percent change in nominal GDP. The HPI
increased only 284 percent, about half the change in housing wealth. Given this, the HPI is
less useful for our purposes than it might be for others. Also, this may explain why people
who focus on Shiller’s data have not noticed the facts we document in the other sources.
To reiterate, we are interested in the value of home capital scaled by either GDP or
M1S, and we want to know how this is related to inflation and interest rates, because our
theory makes strong predictions about that. We are less interested in house prices, or house
prices relative to general consumer prices, because as we show theory makes less definitive
predictions about that. Several U.S. data sets indicate that appropriately scaled values of
home capital are positively related to inflation and interest rates. Although the exact semielasticities vary, the pattern is usually quite clear, and when it is less clear, like in the earlier
half of the last century, this may be due to events like the Depression, major wars and price
controls.

1.2

Other Countries

Data on housing wealth prior to 1990, and certainly prior to 1980, are virtually nonexistent
outside the U.S. However, various estimates of prices have been constructed for several
countries. As we said, we prefer price times quantity, but for most countries prices are all
we have. Figure 6 presents house prices over GDP vs inflation for 16 countries, where now
we do not distinguish the 2000s since the boom and bust is less apparent in these economies.
We have direct source data for Belgium, France, Ireland, Switzerland and the UK. For the
remaining countries, we use 1971-2009 data from the Bank for International Settlements
(BIS) (see Andre 2010). We are less sure about these data, since we do not know the
original sources, but we checked price growth from the BIS against source data for the five
economies mentioned above, and they align well, giving us some confidence. The bottom
line is that there is a positive relationship in 13 out of the 16 countries.
To conclude, virtually every source of information we could find — and we made an eﬀort
to cast our net widely — points to similar conclusions. There is a positive relationship between
house prices over GDP or over the money supply, on the one hand, and inflation or nominal
interest rates, on the other hand. This is clear at least for the US, and we did what we could
for other countries. The rest of the paper presents one way of accounting for this evidence.6

Model

Time is discrete and continues forever. Each period has two subperiods, with a distinct set
of markets, as discussed below. This temporal structure is natural, since it allows households to adjust home production after realizing the outcome of their stochastic retail market
experience. There is a [0 1] continuum of homogeneous households, a [0 ] continuum of
retail firms, and a set of production firms, the cardinality of which does not matter due to
6

Jeﬀ Campbell asked whether one should interpret these findings in terms of a moment — a repeated
pattern in the time series — or an event — one big rise and fall in postwar inflation, and suggested the evidence
may be even more compelling from the latter point of view. We are agnostic.

8

constant returns. There is also a government that controls the money supply  and levies
a lump sum tax  . In the first subperiod’s market, production firms hire labor and capital
from households at nominal factor prices  and , to make output . Households purchase 
for direct consumption, and for investment in home and market capital. Retailers purchase
 and transform it into a diﬀerent good , to sell to households in the market that convenes
in the second subperiod.
Households discount at rate  = 1 − 1  0 across periods, but not across subperiods,
without loss of generality. Within-period utility is
 (     ) −   −   
where  ,  and  are consumption in the first market, consumption in the second (retail)
market, and nonmarket (home) consumption, while  and  are market and nonmarket
labor hours. Having utility linear in labor keeps the analysis tractable. For some of what
we do, we shut down  so that there are only two goods, but it is useful to bring  back
for quantitative work, as it is important for matching velocity observations. Also, in the
quantitative work we consider two specific functional forms, but for now we keep a general
specification  (·), satisfying the usual monotonicity and convexity assumptions.
There are two nominal assets: money , which is is used as a medium of exchange;
and a bond , the role of which is merely to compute an interest rate — i.e.,  need not be
traded in equilibrium, but we can still price it. There are three real assets: market capital  ,
residential structures  , and land  . As is standard,  is an input to the market production
function  (   ). There is also a nonmarket production function  (   ), where  is
nonmarket capital, which in the theoretical discussion we call housing even though in the
empirical analysis we add consumer durables. Housing combines residential structures and
land according to  =  (   ). One could alternatively say that home production has
three inputs, labor, structures and land, but for our purposes we want housing to be an

9

explicit function of  and  . Market capital and structures depreciate at rates   and   ,
while land does not depreciate and it’s fixed supply is normalized to 1. The technologies
 (·),  (·) and  (·) are strictly increasing, concave and homogeneous of degree 1.
While the first-subperiod market is frictionless, the retail market has search-type frictions.
There are two distinct locations, one where agents have access to record keeping, and another
where they do not. The measures of households that get to trade in the first and second
locations are 1 and 2 , so  0 = 1 −  1 −  2 is the measure that do not get to trade at all. To
remember the notation, the  in  refers to the number of payment instruments available:
with probability 1 there is one, money; with probability  2 there two, money and credit; and
probability  0 there are none. Credit means acceptance by retailers of households’ promises,
to be honored in first-subperiod next period. When record keeping is not available, credit
is impossible and trade requires currency.7 We assume the same measure of retailers and
households trade in each location, and since the ratio of retailers to households is , a given
retailer trades in the credit market with probability  2 , and in the money market with
probability  1 . We assume that all agents are price takers in the retail markets.8

2.1

Households’ Problems

At the start of each period, a household’s state variable is a portfolio z = (       ),
plus outstanding debt from the previous period, . Given quasi-linear utility, without loss
in generality we assume all debt is paid oﬀ in the first subperiod. Let  (z ) and  (ẑ  )
be the value functions in the first and second subperiods. The first-subperiod problem is
 (z ) = max {−  +  (ẑ  )}
st  +  + Ω =   + ̂ +  ̂ +  ̂ +  ̂ +  ̂ 
7

Since Kocherlakota (1998), we know it is imperfect record keeping that generates an essential role for
a medium of exchange. For more on why currency, and not, say, bonds or claims to capital, is used in this
capacity, see Lester et al. (2011) and references therein (although this is not a solved problem).
8
One can say they meet multilaterally in these markets, on islands, as in the Lucas-Prescott labor-search
model, instead of bilaterally, as in the Mortensen-Pissarides search-and-bargaining model.

where  ,  and  are the prices of ,  and , respectively, and we define net wealth, after
a lump sum tax  , by9
Ω =  +  +  (1 −   )  +  (1 −  )  +   −  − 

asset  =   the FOC is   =   , where for  the price is  = 1, for  it
is  etc. A similar condition holds for  which is carried into the second subperiod to be
combined with  and  . The envelope conditions are

(5)

In the second subperiod, three events may occur for households: with probability 0
they have no opportunity to trade in the retail market; with probability 1 they have an
opportunity to trade using money; and with probability 2 they have an opportunity to trade
using money or credit. Conditional on each event, the value function is denoted   (ẑ  ),
 = 0 1 2, and  (ẑ  ) = Σ     (ẑ  ). In what follows, we use two standard results: First,
in the money-only retail market households cash out — i.e., they bring no more money than
they plan to spend in the event that credit is unavailable. Second, when credit is available,
all agents are indiﬀerent between using credit or cash, so we assume they use credit only.
9

Since ,  and  are the same physical good, they have the same price,  . Also, notice households
choose market work  in the first subperiod, but home work  is not decided until the second. Finally, one
can imagine that households build their own homes using purchases of  and  , but as we discuss below,
it is equivalent to have them buy houses from competitive construction firms.

happened in the retail market. For a household with no retail opportunity, 0 = 0,

(1 + ) (1 + ), (12) says  = 1 (1 + ) Agents are happy with any  iﬀ this holds.

Firms’ Problems

The representative production firm maximizes profit by hiring labor and capital,
Π = max {  ( ) −  − } 

(13)

where  and  are aggregates. The solution satisfies  =  1 ( ) and  =  2 ( ),
and Π = 0 by constant returns.
Retail firms purchase  and convert it into  , where for simplicity the conversion is one
to one. They have an opportunity to sell it for money or credit in the retail market with
probabilities 1  and 2 , resp. Because we assume that unsold inventory fully depreciates
when the retail market closes, venders supply their wares inelastically, so 1 = 2 = 
(consumption is the same in the cash and credit markets). Therefore, expected retail profit
is

Π = max −  +  1  +  2  

(14)

The first term on the RHS of (14) is the cost of inventories; the second is expected revenue
from cash sales, discounted by  = 1 (1 + ) since this can only be dispersed next period;
and the third is expected revenue from credit sales discounted the same way. The FOC is

(15)

Retailers are happy with any  as long as (15) holds, and Π = 0. To pay for , in the
first market, retailers issue bonds that households are happy to buy given  = 1 (1 + )
(although nothing interesting would change if, say, retailers instead issue equity).

2.3

Policy

Government controls the supply of money, which grows at rate . This can be implemented
either using the lump sum tax/transfer  , or by spending new money on  (with quasilinear utility, nothing depends on this except  ). Without loss of generality, we balance the
budget each period. We focus on stationary outcomes where all real variables are constant,
implying  = . Hence, it is equivalent to use the money growth rate or inflation rate as
a policy instrument. Since 1 +  = (1 + ) (1 + ), it is also equivalent to use the nominal
interest rate . Policy does not determine the real interest rate across periods; that is pinned
down by the preference parameter .

Equilibrium

We first show how to express all prices (        1  2 ) in terms of the allocation. To
¡
¢
¡
¢
begin with factor prices, we already know  = 1 ̄   and  = 1 ̄   , where

̄ is aggregate market hours and equilibrium requires  =  and ̄ = . Note that for
each household  =  (Ω) depends on their wealth at the start of the period, which diﬀers
according to their recent retail experience, but all we need to characterize macro equilibrium
R
is ̄ =  (Ω). In terms of land, (10) implies it is priced by its capitalized value as an

input to housing, which is itself an input to home production,

 = (1 − )−1 2 (   ) E (2 2 )  
Notice on the RHS we divide by  and multiply by the wage , to convert utility into
time and time into money. For bond prices, we already know  = 1 (1 + ) where  is

14

eﬀectively set by policy. For retail prices, in the cash market 1 1 = ̂ = (1 + ) , and in
the credit market we have the FOC 2 (  2  2 ) = 2  0 . Hence, 1 = (1 + ) 1
and 2 = (1 + ) 2 (  2  2 )  . Finally, from the retailers’ FOC (15) we get the price
level in the first subperiod,
 =

 1 1 +  2 2

 (1 + )

This gives all prices as functions of the allocation. In fact, we can pare down the description of an allocation as follows. In terms of land, structures and housing, since  = 1 and
 =  (  1), we need only keep track of  . And in terms of consumption, 1 = 2 = 
and  = [   (  1)]. So we can fully describe an allocation by retail inventories, market
and home capital, and market and home work.
Definition 1 A steady state equilibrium is given by (       ̄   ) satisfying: the FOC

Nominal GDP is ( 1 1 +  2 2 ) + (   +    +  ). With  as a price index, real GDP
is
 = ( 1 1 +  2 2 )  +   +   +  

(23)

Velocity is  =  , and a standard notion of money demand is 1 =   (see, e.g.,
Lucas 2000). Finally, consider the price of a house  and value of the stock   , the empirical objects discussed earlier. If we introduce competitive home builders, the allocation is
the same as if individuals build their own houses; yet we can still imagine builders combining land and structures according to household specifications to deliver  =  (   ). The
profit from this activity is
Π =   (   ) −   −   

(24)

which is 0 in equilibrium. Hence,   =   +   and  = (  +   )  (   ).

Simple Model: Analytic Results

The general framework is complicated, because we are interested in some complicated issues,
but we can simplify it to convey the intuition. First, eliminate investment decisions by fixing
market capital and structures at  and  , with   =  = 0, so housing is fixed at
 =  (  1). Then to ease the presentation, for now, simplify household production by
setting  =  . Also, rather than trading  and  , households now trade  directly at
price  , and trade  at price  . Also set 2 = 0, so there is no retail credit, and ignore
bonds, so z = (    ). Finally, ignore  = 0 by writing utility as  (   ). Then the

Walrasian pricing in this exercise, although we can imagine bringing back bargaining in future work.

are not too risk averse, inflation also increases  deflated by nominal GDP defined using
consumer prices.
Of course, with  fixed, all the results about  can be restated as eﬀects on the value
of housing wealth   . We summarize all this as follows:

We are most interested in the eﬀects of  on housing wealth   , relative to either 
or GDP, as discussed above. The idea is that inflation aﬀects the economy in general, and
housing in particular, by creating an incentive to move economic activity out of the market
and into the home. We have shown how these eﬀects work qualitatively, and later we consider
their magnitude. Before the quantitative work, however, we mention that the analytic results
can be generalized to some degree, and sketch the extension to a general home technology
 =  (   ). For this we set  = 1 = 1 and still abstract from investment.
Generalizing (28), we now get two equations in time use (   )

These conditions exhibit a nice symmetry between market and home time use, only broken
by exactly the channel we want to highlight: the former is taxed, while the latter is not

We like the fact that this theory generates such clean analytic predictions, at least with
capital fixed. Even with endogenous investment, the model is still fairly tractable. Continuing to set  1 = 1, with endogenous investment we have
(1 + )  = 1 [   (   )] 1 (   )
 = 2 [   (   )] 1 (   )

where  satisfies the obvious feasibility condition. If so inclined, one can also assume  is
endogenous but  fixed (or vice-versa) by dropping the final (penultimate) equation. While
some analytic results are available, at this stage computational methods are appropriate —
especially since we want the magnitudes, not just signs, of the relevant eﬀects.

 if we want to match standard observations on velocity (something that obviously never
came up in nonmonetary home production models). Hence, we consider two specifications,
both of which seem a priori reasonable. In Calibration 1,  and  are perfect substitutes
and we identify them collectively as market consumption:13

 (     ) = log [( +  ) +  ] 
Here 1(1 − ) is the EOS between market and home goods. In Calibration 2, we use:
 (     ) =  log ( ) + (1) log ( +  )
13

There is implicitly a constant multiplying  , but we can set it to 1 without loss of generality by a
choice of units.

20

Here  no longer directly captures the EOS we want to target, so we average (using expenditure shares) the EOS between  and  , which is 1, and between  and  , which is
1 (1 − ).
We use long-run observations to calibrate as many parameters as we can, and use properties of the empirical money demand curve, including its elasticity, for some others. Unless
otherwise noted, our targets are computed using US data, for the period 1975 to 1999 (since
we are not attempting to explain the housing bubble). The length of a period is a quarter,
although the results are robust to this choice. The average annual inflation rate and 3-month
T-bill rate are 413% and 680% in the sample, which yield  = 00066 and  = 00103. We
set  = 073 to match the value of residential structures plus durables relative to the value
of housing capital, and set   =   = 0015 for a 6% annual depreciation rate on both 
and  , all obtained using data discussed in Section 2. We set 2 = 051 , so that there are
half as many retail trades with credit as there are with money, based on data from the recent
Bank of Canada Methods of Payment Survey.14
Since a key parameter is , as it governs the EOS between market and home goods, we
discuss this in some more detail. In their original home production macro model, Benhabib
et. al. (1991) argue for an EOS of 5. Estimates by Rupert et al. (1995) using PSID
data, however, yield numbers closer to 18 or 2. Estimates by McGrattan et al. (1995) using
aggregate time series and a DSGE model yield values between 15 and 18. Aguiar and Hurst
(2007a), using scanner and time-use data, estimate an EOS of 18 Chang and Schorfheide
(2003) using aggregate data get a slightly higher estimate of 23. While there is obviously no
unique definitive number, there is a consensus on a reasonable range, and as a compromise
we use an EOS of 18, the median of these estimates. In Calibration 1 this immediately
implies  = 044, while in Calibration 2 we need to calibrate  jointly with the remaining
14

See Arango and Welte (2012). To give a little more detail, the probabilities of using cash in any
transaction for single and married people are 55% and 48%, resp., and the probabilities of using credit cards
are 20% and 25%, resp., making  2 close to  1 2

21

parameters to match the EOS target.
At this point, for Calibration 1 the parameters (           1 ), and for Calibration 2 these plus , are calibrated to match the following targets. As is standard in the
literature (Greenwood et al. 1995) households work on average ̄ = 33% of their discretionary time in the market and ̄ = 25% in the home, while market capital over annual
output is   = 207 and household capital over annual output is   = 196. For the
retail markup we target 30% based on data from the Annual Retail Trade Survey.15 Finally,
we match the level and slope of money demand, targeting an average annual velocity of
576 and a semi-elasticity of with respect to  of 256%, obtained using a standard log-linear
regression. While the parameters are calibrated jointly, heuristically  and  match the
targets for hours,  and  match the capital-output ratios,  matches the markup, 
matches the level of velocity and  1 matches its elasticity.
The top panel of Table 2 report calibration results. In Calibration 2  is 083, which
implies a large EOS between  and  (coincidently, very nearly the value used in Benhabib
et. al. 1991), but maintains the target EOS between overall market and nonmarket consumption of 18. In terms of the retail market, for Calibration 1 (2 is similar), the measure of
retailers is  = 022, and the measure of households that trade each period is 1 +  2 = 017.
Therefore (1 +  2 ) , or 78%, is the fraction of retail inventories sold each period, while
17% of households make a purchase in this market each period. Defining market expenditure as   + 1 1 1 + 2 2 2 , about 15% of total market consumption is purchased in
the frictional retail market, while the rest is  ; this is largely driven by average velocity in
the data. To understand the importance of home production, we compute the percentage
increase in market consumption required to compensate for the loss if home consumption
set to 0. For households that are able to trade in the retail market, each period, market
15

We first saw this data discussed in Faig and Jerez (2005). To give more detail, at the low end (Warehouse
Clubs, Superstores, Automotive Dealers and Gas Stations), markups range from 17% to 21%; at the high
end (Specialty Foods, Clothing, Footware and Furniture), they range from 42% to 44%. We pick 30%, right
in the middle.

22

consumption has to increase by 77% to compensate for no home production. For households
that cannot trade in the retail market, this number is 152%. Hence, both retail and home
consumption are economically important.

5.1

Positive Results

We now ask how well the model accounts for the facts discussed in Section 1 — the relationship
between the inflation or nominal interest rate, on the one hand, and the value of home
capital over nominal output or over the money supply, on the other. Here we denote the
value of home capital over nominal output and over the money supply by  and .
These ratios are tightly connected to inverse velocity,  , by the relationship  =
 × . Since the average value of  and   are calibration targets, the average
value of  matches the data, by construction. The only elasticity we target is the semielasticity of   with respect to the nominal rate, denoted    . The model generates
endogenously a semi-elasticity for  , denoted   , and the elasticity of  then
follows from   =   +    . We are mainly interested in seeing how the model
accounts for   .16
We first compute the steady state for diﬀerent values of  in the data between 19751999. This takes every year to be a steady state of the model with a particular , which is
obviously not strictly correct, due to the persistence of shocks and transitions. As we think
the theory is more relevant for medium- to longer-run observations, this may not be such
a bad approximation; in any case, studying shocks or transitional dynamics is beyond the
scope of this project. Then, among other statistics, for a particular variable of interest ,
we compute the relevant elasticity by regressing log ( ) on a constant and . Table 2 reports
the results and Figure 7 shows  ,  and  vs.  for Calibrations 1 and 2, as well
as the data. In Calibration 1 we get   = 023 and in Calibration 2 we get   = 055, or
16

One reason for this is something pointed out by Marcelo Veracierto: even if   does not move at all,
as long as real balances fall with , we get   right, at least qualitatively, by construction. It therefore
seems more interesting, and challenging, to focus on   .

23

21% and 50% of the semi-elasticities in the data, respectively.17 It obviously matters which
specification one uses: diﬀerent ways a disaggregating market consumption into  and 
are simply not equivalent, even when they are roughly similar in terms of their predictions
for the EOS. More work can be done to uncover which is a better specification.
Given that we tend to think the theory is mainly relevant at medium-run frequencies, and
less relevant for business cycles, we do not expect to match all the fluctuations in the data.
But as Figure 7 shows, we capture the main long-run patterns fairly well. These findings
are robust. Changing the level of risk aversion from 1 to 12 or 2, e.g., has little eﬀect. Nor
does increasing the calibration frequency to monthly or even weekly. This is important, to
us, because it is one of the reasons for modeling retail as a frictional market. With a typical
cash-in-advance model, where households spend all their money each period, there is no way
to match velocity when the period is short. With our frictional retail market, we can shorten
the period length and keep everything else basically the same by scaling the arrival rates.
As regards the EOS target, varying this in the range 15 to 23 yields roughly similar results,
although as the EOS increases the fraction of   accounted for by the model increases. In
fact, if in Calibration 2 we use an EOS of 5, we can account for basically 100% of   . But
an EOS of 5 is too high, given the body of empirical work. We prefer to conclude that for a
reasonable EOS we can account for 20% − 50% of the relationship.

5.2

Normative Results

We are also interested in how inflation aﬀects welfare. There are two reasons for revisiting this
classic issue. First, it is well known that models with relatively explicit microfoundations
for money can generate bigger costs of inflation than reduced-form models. A standard
exercise is to compute the cost of 10% inflation as the amount of consumption households
would be willing to sacrifice to go from 10% to the Friedman rule, which means an inflation
17

When we consider   , the model accounts between 78% and 87% of the elasticity in the data, but
again we prefer to focus on   

24

rate consistent with a 0 nominal interest rate. A consensus estimate from reduced-form
analyses is that the answer is around 12 of 1%, while in various versions of the model in
Lagos and Wright (2005) the number can easily be closer to 5%, an order of magnitude
higher (see Aruoba et al. 2011 for references). Second, it is well known that incorporating
home production into otherwise standard models can have a big quantitative impact on fiscal
policy, so why not see if this is also the case for monetary policy?18
Figure 8 shows how the equilibrium changes with inflation. Results are shown for the two
benchmark calibrations, as well as a version of the model with home production shut down.
Since inflation is a tax on money holdings, higher inflation reduces real money balances and
1 . Since 1 = 2 = , this also reduces demand by retailers for inventories, employment
and investment. In the model with no home production, market activity falls with inflation,
and this creates a loss in welfare. In the household production model households can make
up for some of the lost market consumption by increasing home consumption. In the end,
the cost of inflation is larger when home production is an option: going from 10% inflation
to the Friedman rule implies a welfare gain of 04% without home production, 053% in
Calibration 1, and 066% in Calibration 2.
Hence inflation is more costly with home production, especially when home and market
goods are better substitutes. As in standard public finance, a household’s optimal behavior
in response to an increase in inflation is to reduce market and increase nonmarket activity.
Depending on the degree of substitutability, individual welfare may be minimally aﬀected by
this. But if all households do the same thing, aggregate demand for home capital and  
rise — e.g., by about 015% as inflation goes up from the Friedman rule to 10% in Calibration
18

In fact, the main reason for the big welfare eﬀects in Lagos-Wright models is that they use bargaining,
rather competitive pricing. Bargaining power can be calibrated to match the markup, which would be 0
with competitive pricing. With a markup calibrated to the data, bargaining introduces what is sometimes
called a hold-up problem in money demand, which, in our notation, reduces  below the eﬃcient level even
at the Friedman rule. In this paper, even with competitive pricing we get a markup. Although it may be
worth incorporating noncompetitive pricing in the future, here we ask how home production aﬀects the cost
of inflation without the complication of hold-up problems.

25

1. Due to these general equilibrium eﬀects, the increase in home consumption does not
completely make up for the loss in market consumption. In Calibration 2  responds
significantly more, due to the higher substitutability between  and  , and households
increase their demand for housing so much that   grows by about three times as much
as in Calibration 1. While there is room for more work on this important topic, we want to
simply make one point: microfoundations matter for quantitative policy issues, not just for
aesthetics, and this is true for both the microfoundations of monetary economics and the
microfoundations of household behavior.

6

Conclusion

Many people these days seem interested in housing. Our view is that housing is household
capital, and it only makes sense to study this by specifying how this capital enters the
home production function, exactly as we study investment in market capital by specifying
how it enters into the market production function. We began by asking if housing is a
good hedge against inflation. The answer is yes, in this sense: when inflation is high, and
hence one’s money is worth less, the value of the housing stock is high. In terms of hard
data, we documented that appropriately-deflated values of the housing stock, measured using
various sources, go up with inflation or nominal interest rates. In terms of theory, we proved
analytically the model is consistent with this finding. Numerical work shows the model
accounts for a reasonable portion of the key observations, between 20% and 50%, depending
on which version one uses. Clearly it matters which utility function one uses, and this is
worth further study. In any case, although we can account for a relevant fraction of the
observations under study, there a lot left to be explained, and hence more to be done in
future work.

Data for GDP for all countries comes from the IFS.

•

Data for inflation (GDP deflator) for all countries except England and France comes from the
World Bank World Development Indicators, which can be downloaded from
http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators . These data begin in
1961, explaining the use of different data for England and France

•

The data for inflation in England are derived from the Retail Price Index (RPI) all items, as
published by the Office for National Statistics table RP02.

•

The data for inflation for France are from the same source as for house prices:
