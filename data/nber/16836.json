    "abstract": "\n\nFinancial intermediaries borrow in order to lend.  When credit is increasing rapidly, the traditional deposit funding (core liabilities) is supplemented with other funding (non-core liabilities).  We explore the hypothesis that monetary aggregates reflect the size of non-core and core liabilities and hence convey information on the stage of the financial cycle.  In emerging economies with open capital markets, non-core liabilities of the banking system take the form of short-term foreign exchange liabilities, increasing the vulnerability to the outbreak of \"twin crises\" where a liquidity crisis is compounded by a currency crisis.\n\n",
