    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper investigates the choice of living arrangements among elderly Americans. It has two specific aims. First, because health is not directly measurable and can only be described by indicators such as ADLs and IADLs, it explores a new econometric approach to model the influence of the latent health status on living arrangements. Second, it exploits the NBER Economic Supplement of the Longitudinal Study on Aging to investigate the role of housing and financial wealth in the choice of living arrangements.\n\n",
