Sticky Information: A Model of Monetary Nonneutrality and Structural Slumps
N. Gregory Mankiw and Ricardo Reis
NBER Working Paper No. 8614
December 2001
JEL No. E0, E3, E5

ABSTRACT
This paper explores a model of wage adjustment based on the assumption that information
disseminates slowly throughout the population of wage setters. This informational frictional yields
interesting and plausible dynamics for employment and inflation in response to exogenous movements
in monetary policy and productivity. In this model, disinflations and productivity slowdowns have a
parallel effect: They both cause the path of employment to fall below the level that would prevail under
full information. The model implies that, in the face of productivity change, a policy of targeting either
nominal income or the nominal wage leads to more stable employment than does a policy of targeting
the price of goods and services. Finally, we examine U.S. time series and find that, as the model predicts,
unemployment fluctuations are associated with both inflation and productivity surprises.

How do employment and inflation respond to real and monetary forces? What frictions
cause these macroeconomic variables to deviate from the ideals that would arise in a fully classical
world? These questions are at the center of macroeconomic research, as well as at the center of
much of Ned Phelps's formidable research career. Early in his career Phelps (1967, 1968), together
with Milton Friedman (1968), gave us the natural rate hypothesis, which remains the benchmark for
understanding monetary nonneutrality. More recently, Phelps's work on structural slumps (1994)
has examined the real forces that can cause the natural rate of unemployment to change over time.
This paper offers a model that weaves together these two threads of Phelps's work. In this
model, information is assumed to disseminate slowly throughout the population of wage setters,
and as a result, wages respond slowly to news about changing economic conditions. Our model
includes two kinds of relevant information: news about aggregate demand, as determined by
monetary policy, and news about equilibrium real wages, as determined by productivity.
We introduce this sticky-information model in Section I. The model generalizes the one in
Mankiw and Reis (2001). In the earlier paper, we applied the assumption of sticky information to
the price-setting process in order to understand the dynamic response of the economy to monetary
policy. The resulting model has three properties that are consistent with the conventional wisdom of
central bankers and the empirical evidence of macroeconometricians. First, disinflations in the
model are always contractionary (although announced disinflations are less contractionary than
surprise ones). Second, the model predicts that monetary policy shocks have their maximum impact
on inflation with a substantial delay. Third, given a realistic stochastic process for money growth,

1

the model implies that the change in inflation is positively correlated with the level of economic
activity, which is the well-known "accelerationist Phillips curve." The model presented here
encompasses the previous model--and thus these results--as a special case.
In Section II we offer some new results that come from applying the sticky-information
assumption to the labor market and introducing productivity as an additional driving force. We
show that disinflations and productivity slowdowns have parallel effects: both cause employment
and output to fall below their classical levels until the information about the new regime works its
way through the economy. Thus, the model may help explain why unemployment rose during the
productivity slowdown of the 1970s and yet again during the Volcker disinflation of the early
1980s. It may also help explain why the productivity resurgence associated with the "new economy"
of the 1990s coincided with falling unemployment. Ball and Moffitt (2001) and Staiger, Stock, and
Watson (2001) have recently documented the empirical importance of productivity trends for shifts
in the Phillips curve. The sticky-information model presented here offers one interpretation of those
findings.
In Section III we examine how the economy reacts to a change in trend productivity if the
monetary authority responds either by stabilizing employment or by stabilizing inflation. We find
that a strict policy of stabilizing inflation causes large fluctuations in employment. We also find that
the employment-stabilizing policy keeps both nominal income and the nominal wage on its
predetermined path. These results are a warning for the many central banks around the world that
have adopted inflation targeting as a policy framework. They suggest that employment would be

2

more stable if the monetary authority used nominal income or the price of labor, rather than the
price of goods and services, as its nominal anchor.
In Section IV we use the model as a lens through which to examine U.S. quarterly time
series. According to the model, employment is a function of unexpected movements in inflation
and productivity, where expectations are formed at various points in the past. The key parameter
that governs this relationship is the one that measures the stickiness of information. When we apply
the model and estimate this parameter, we find the average wage setter updates his information
about once a year. Moreover, the correlation between predicted and actual unemployment is as high
as 0.60. Thus, the sticky-information model can be used to explain much of the observed variation
in aggregate unemployment as a response to inflation and productivity surprises. One anomaly,
however, is that productivity surprises appear to influence unemployment with a lag of several
quarters.
This paper brings together many elements from the literature on inflation-employment
dynamics that Phelps helped to spawn. The natural rate hypothesis, imperfect information,
infrequent adjustment, and the wage curve all play central roles in the model. Our goal is not to
offer a radically new theory but to combine familiar elements in a new way in an attempt to better
explain monetary nonneutrality and structural slumps.

I. The Wage Curve Meets Sticky Information
The model we offer aims to explain the dynamics of wages, prices, employment, and

3

output. There are two key elements: the wage curve and the assumption of sticky information.

The Wage Curve
The starting point is an equation describing the target nominal wage w*:
w*t = pt + θt + αet,
where p is the price level, θ is labor productivity, and e is employment. All variables are in logs,
and employment is normalized so that it averages zero. This equation resembles the wage curve, as
in Phelps (1994) and Blanchflower and Oswald (1995). Some might call it a "pseudo labor supply
curve."
The simplest way to motivate this equation is from the standpoint of a union that sets
wages. The union has a target for the real wage that depends on its workers' productivity. In
addition, high employment makes the union more aggressive, raising the wages they demand.
Another way to view this wage equation is from the standpoint a firm that sets wages in an
efficiency-wage environment. The wage curve describes a "no shirking condition." Firms pay
productive workers more because they have better outside alternatives. In addition, high
employment raises shirking among workers, because unemployment is a less potent threat. As a
result, high employment induces firms to offer higher wages.

The Sticky Information Assumption
To this standard wage curve, we add the assumption that wage setters make their decisions

4

based on imperfect information. Every wage setter sets a new wage every period, but they collect
information about the economy and update their decisions slowly over time.
Our assumption about information arrival is analogous to the adjustment assumption in the
Calvo (1983) model of price adjustment. That is, adjustment occurs as a Poisson process. In each
period, a fraction λ of the wage setters obtains new information about the state of the economy and
recomputes optimal plans based on that new information. Other wage setters continue to set wages
based on old plans and outdated information. Each wage setter has the same probability of being
1

one of those updating their information, regardless of how long it has been since its last update.
A wage setter that last updated its information j periods ago sets the wage
j

w t = Et-j w*t.
The aggregate wage is the average of wages in the economy:
∞
j
j
wt = λ Σ (1 - λ) w t.
j=0
These two equations, together with the wage curve equation above, fully describe the process of
wage setting.
The rest of the model is conventional. The overall price level is determined by the level of
wages and labor productivity:

1

A natural question is whose expectations suffer from the stickiness of information. Under the
union interpretation of the wage curve, the expectations are clearly those of the union workers. The
answer is less obvious in the efficiency-wage interpretation, according to which the wage curve
represents the no-shirking condition. In this case, firms set the wages, but because the firms are
trying to induce workers not to shirk, the expectations of the workers are again relevant.
5

pt = wt - θt.
This equation is both the supply curve in the output market (prices depend on costs) and the
demand curve in the labor market (the real wage depends on productivity). The level of output is
determined by employment and labor productivity:
yt = et + θt.
This is the production function. The above five equations together make up the aggregate-supply
side of the model.
It is worth noting what happens in the limiting case when information is perfect (λ=1). It is
straightforward to show that in this case, e=0 and y=θ. That is, under perfect information,
employment is constant, and output mirrors productivity. In this model, all employment dynamics
follow from the assumed stickiness of information.

The Sticky Information Phillips Curve
We can solve for the price level as a function of output by combining the previous five
equations. The resulting aggregate supply equation is
∞
j
pt = { λ Σ (1 - λ) Et-j[ pt + αyt + (1 - α) θt] } - θt.
j=0
With this equation in hand, another special case is apparent. If there are no productivity shocks
(θ=0), the model simplifies to the price adjustment model in Mankiw and Reis (2001). Thus, the
results in that paper concerning the dynamic effects of aggregate demand apply here as well.

6

With some tedious algebra, which we leave to the appendix, this equation for the price level
yields the following equation for the inflation rate:
∞
j
πt = [αλ / (1 - λ) ] et - ∆θt + λ Σ (1 - λ) Et-1-j ( πt + ∆θt + α∆et),
j=0
where ∆et=et-et-1. We call this the sticky-information Phillips curve.
Let's examine each of the determinants of inflation in this model: (1) High employment
means higher inflation: This is the conventional short-run Phillips curve. Here it arises because high
employment raises target wages, which in turn raises costs and thus the prices charged by firms. (2)
Higher productivity growth lowers inflation because it lowers firms' costs of production. (3) Higher
expected inflation raises inflation because, by virtue of the sticky information assumption, past
expectations are still affecting current wage increases. (4) Higher expected productivity growth
raises inflation because it influences the wages that wage-setters thought were appropriate. (5)
Higher expected employment growth also raises inflation because it also influences expected target
wages.

Comparison to a Leading Competitor
This sticky-information Phillips curve is very different from the "new Keynesian Phillips
curve" that has become popular in recent years. The latter model is based on the work of Taylor
(1980), Rotemberg (1982), and Calvo (1983). It implies an expectation-augmented Phillips curve
where current inflation depends on the expectation of next period's inflation. Ignoring productivity

7

shocks for the moment, the new Keynesian Phillips curve can be written as:
πt = γ et + Etπt+1.
For a notable example of a paper applying this model of inflation dynamics, see Clarida, Gali, and
Gertler (1999). McCallum (1997) has called this model "the closest thing there is to a standard
specification," while Goodfriend and King (1997) say it is part of a "new neoclassical synthesis" in
macroeconomics.
Yet this model has some significant empirical flaws. Mankiw (2001) argues that it is
inconsistent with conventional views about the effects of monetary policy. Mankiw and Reis (2001)
compare it with a simple version of the sticky-information model and show that the stickyinformation model yields more plausible dynamics. In particular, according to the new Keynesian
Phillips curve, inflation responds immediately and substantially to monetary shocks, whereas
according to the sticky-information Phillips curve, the effect of monetary shocks on inflation is
delayed and gradual.
The key difference between the models comes from the role of expectations. The new
Keynesian Phillips curve gives a prominent role to current expectations of future inflation. These
expectations can adjust quickly in response to changes in monetary policy. By contrast, the stickyinformation Phillips curve gives a prominent role to past expectations of current inflation. These
expectations are predetermined and, thus, cannot change quickly. In this way, the stickyinformation model more closely resembles an earlier generation of price-adjustment models
proposed by Fischer (1977) and Phelps and Taylor (1977).

8

II. Disinflations and Productivity Slowdowns
We now consider the dynamics of employment and inflation in this sticky-information
model. To do this, we need to close the model with a specification for aggregate demand. One
approach to doing this would be to add a goods market equilibrium condition (that is, an IS curve)
and a monetary policy reaction function for the interest rate (such as a Taylor rule). This approach
has several advantages and might be pursued in future work. But in this paper, we adopt an
approach that, although perhaps less realistic, is simpler and more transparent. We use a simple
money-market equilibrium condition:
mt - pt = β yt.
The parameter β is the income elasticity of money demand. More important for our purposes, it
determines the elasticity of the aggregate demand curve. The smaller is β, the flatter is the aggregate
demand curve. The variable m can be viewed narrowly as the money supply or broadly as a
summary measure of all variables that shift the aggregate demand for goods and services. Thus, we
can refer to m as either money or aggregate demand.
With this equation, we have now fully described the model. For purposes of numerical
illustration, we need to choose values for the parameters. We pick β=1/2. For some of the
qualitative results reported below, it is important that β<1. We also set α=0.1 and λ=0.25. The
value of α measures the sensitivity of the target real wage to labor-market conditions. In the
terminology of Ball and Romer (1990), it measures the degree of "real rigidity." If the period is

9

taken to be a quarter, then λ=0.25 means that wage setters update their information on average once
a year. These parameter values strike us as plausible, and we will use them only for the purposes of
illustration. In a later section, we use the time-series data to estimate λ, the key parameter
measuring the stickiness of information, and find that λ=0.25 fits the data well.
Here we look at how this economy responds to a sudden change in regime. In the first case,
we assume that the annual rate of growth of money m falls by 2 percentage points, or 0.5 percentage
points per quarter. In the second case, we assume that the growth rate of productivity θ falls by this
amount. In each case, the change in the exogenous growth rate is assumed to be sudden,
unexpected, and permanent.
The appendix explains in detail how we solve for the resulting equilibrium path for the
economy, while here we present and discuss the solution in more intuitive terms. Figure 1 shows
the response to each of these disturbances. The top panel shows the path of employment e, and the
bottom panel shows the response of inflation π. Recall that the natural rate of employment in this
model--the level of employment that would prevail if information were perfect--is normalized to
zero. Thus, the employment variable measures how far the economy is operating from what might
be viewed as its "full employment" level.
Figure 1 shows that employment follows a hump-shaped pattern in response to both
disinflations and productivity slowdowns. Employment falls for a while as the impact of the change
in regime builds over time. But then the effect on employment dissipates as the information about
the change in regime spreads its way throughout the population. For these parameters, the

10

maximum impact on employment occurs at 6 quarters, although of course this result is sensitive to
the parameter values we have picked.
The two inflation paths in the bottom of Figure 1 are quite different from each other. In the
case of a slowdown in money growth, inflation declines only gradually. It overshoots the new lower
level briefly as agents learn of the new regime and correct their previous mistakes. In the case of a
productivity slowdown, inflation immediately spikes up, as firms pass on higher costs to
consumers. Inflation gradually declines as wages start reflecting lower productivity growth. After a
brief period of overshooting, inflation eventually settles at a new higher level.
The reader might have noticed that the dynamic paths for employment are similar in the
case of disinflations and productivity slowdowns. This is not a coincidence. In fact, the appendix
proves the following:

Proposition: Productivity has an impact on employment that is exactly 1-β times that of aggregate
demand.

This naturally leads to:

Corollary: If the aggregate demand curve is unit elastic ( β=1 ), then productivity has no effect on
employment.

11

The intuition behind the corollary is the following: Adverse news about productivity influences
target nominal wages in two ways. Target nominal wages fall because target real wages are lower,
and they rise because the price level is higher. If β=1 and the path of m is held constant, these two
effects exactly cancel. In this special case, wages stay exactly on track to maintain full employment,
despite the slow diffusion of information.

III. Stabilization Policy in the Face of Productivity Change
The outcomes shown in Figure 1 assume that when the economy experiences a productivity
slowdown, the monetary authority holds aggregate demand on the same path that it otherwise
would have followed. This benchmark is natural, but it need not hold. As employment and inflation
fluctuate, the monetary authority may well respond by altering aggregate demand. Here we consider
two other natural benchmarks.
One possibility is that the monetary authority may choose a policy to stabilize employment.
This means it would adjust aggregate demand m to keep e=0 at all times. Because fluctuations in
employment in this model arise because of imperfections in private information and because the
monetary authority is assumed to have full information, it might well try to achieve the level of
employment and output that private decisionmakers would choose on their own if only they were
better informed.
Alternatively, the central bank may choose to stabilize inflation. This means it would adjust

12

aggregate demand to maintain a constant inflation rate. This benchmark is interesting in part
because many central banks are in fact now committed to inflation targeting as a policy framework
(although many such regimes allow temporary deviations from a strict target).
There is also another reason to focus on the employment path that follows under an
inflation-stabilizing policy: This path corresponds to what econometricians might measure as the
NAIRU (the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment). In this model, the natural rate of
employment--that is, the level that would prevail with full information--is assumed constant. Yet
the rate of employment associated with nonaccelerating inflation is not constant. To find the level
of employment that corresponds to the measured NAIRU, we can solve the model assuming that
monetary policy stabilizes inflation.
Figure 2 shows employment and inflation in response to a productivity slowdown under
three policies: constant aggregate demand, employment stabilization, and inflation stabilization.
The appendix presents the details of solution.
The figure shows that inflation stabilization leads to very large fluctuations in employment.
To extinguish the impact on inflation, monetary policy responds to the adverse shift in aggregate
supply by contracting aggregate demand. This instability in employment under inflation
stabilization can be viewed as a warning to the many central banks around the world that have
adopted inflation targeting. In essence, a productivity slowdown in this model looks like a rise in
the NAIRU. This is consistent with the empirical results in Ball and Moffitt (2001) and Staiger,
Stock, and Watson (2001). Yet the natural rate--the level of employment that would prevail under

13

full information--has not changed. The fall in employment that results from a productivity
slowdown is no more desirable in this model than any other downturn. Yet a policy of inflation
stabilization not only tolerates the downturn in employment but exacerbates it to keep inflation
under control.
Figure 2 also shows that a policy of employment stabilization leads to a permanent rise in
the inflation rate. That is, for the central bank to maintain full employment during a productivity
slowdown, it has to accommodate the adverse shift in aggregate supply by raising aggregate
demand, permitting a higher inflation rate. The rise in inflation needed to stabilize employment
equals the magnitude of the slowdown in productivity growth. That is, a slowdown of 2 percent per
year requires an increase in the inflation rate of 2 percentage points.
There are other ways to describe the policy of stabilizing employment. It turns out that along
the path with stable employment, both nominal income (p+y) and the nominal wage (w) equal their
previously expected values. Turning this observation around leads to a policy: If the central bank
commits to keeping either nominal income or the nominal wage at a constant level (or growing at
some constant rate), aggregate demand and inflation in the price of goods and services will
automatically respond to a productivity shift by exactly the right amount to maintain full
employment.
Overall, this model suggests that inflation targeting may not be the best framework for
monetary policy in the face of changing productivity. A better target variable than the price of
goods and services is nominal income or the price of labor. Like inflation targeting, targeting

14

nominal income or the nominal wage gives monetary policy a nominal anchor, but it does so in a
way that permits greater stability in employment. There is a long tradition suggesting the
desirability of nominal income targeting; see Tobin (1980) and Hall and Mankiw (1994) for two
examples. But, as far as we know, the possibility of targeting the price of labor has not received
much attention.
One exception is the plan discussed in Phelps (1978). Phelps concludes, “the program
envisioned here aims to stabilize wages on a level or rising path, leaving the price level to be
buffetted by supply shocks and exchange-rate disturbances.” This is precisely the policy suggested
by the sticky-information model of wage setting. We agree with Phelps that nominal wage targeting
2

seems like a promising alternative to inflation targeting as a monetary policy rule .

IV. An Empirical Application
In the model presented here, inflation and productivity surprises drive employment
fluctuations. This section examines this prediction using U.S. time series data to get a sense of how
well the model works and to learn where it has problems matching the world.

The Approach
We start with the sticky-information Phillips curve presented earlier:
2

Aoki (2001) presents a related result: In a world with a sticky-price sector and a flexible-price
sector, optimal monetary policy targets inflation in the sticky-price sector. In our model, the labor
market is analogous to the sticky-price sector.
15

∞
j
πt = [ αλ / (1 - λ) ] et - ∆θt + λ Σ (1 - λ) Et-1-j( πt + ∆θt + α∆et ).
j=0
Now turn this equation around to use it as a theory of employment:
∞
j
et = [ (1 - λ) / αλ ] [ πt + ∆θt - λ Σ (1 - λ) Et-1-j (πt + ∆θt + α∆et ) ].
j=0
This equation implicitly expresses employment as a function of inflation, productivity, and the past
expectations of these variables.
Our goal is to see whether this equation can help explain observed U.S. fluctuations. To do
this, we make two auxiliary assumptions.
First, we assume that inflation and productivity growth follow univariate stochastic
processes. Their moving average representations can be written as:
∞
πt = Σ ρj εt-j
j=0
∞
=
Σ ηj vt-j
∆θt
j=0
In this case, the expectations of inflation and productivity growth are a function of their past
3

univariate innovations. As the appendix shows, the model can now be solved as
3

In reality, expectations may also depend on other information. For example, news about
monetary policy may affect expected inflation. But experience suggests that the improvement from
multivariate over univariate forecasting is often slight. Future work could improve upon this
assumption, but we probably don't go too far wrong assuming univariate processes for inflation and
productivity growth.
16

∞
∞
α et = Σ γj εt-j + Σ ψj vt-j
j=0
j=0
where the parameters {γj} and {ψj} are functions of {ρj}, {ηj}, and λ. This equation can be used to
predict fluctuations in employment, taking as inputs the univariate innovations in inflation and
productivity.
Second, we assume that the observed unemployment rate is linearly related to a moving
average of e, the employment variable in our model. In particular, the unemployment rate u is
assumed to be:
s

ut = δ0 - δ1 e t,
s

where e t is defined as
s

e t = [ et-3 + 2et-2 + 3et-1 + 4et + 3et+1 + 2et+2 + et+3] / 16.
We found that without any smoothing of the predicted employment variable, the model produces
too much high-frequency variation in the predicted unemployment rate. This triangular filter
smooths out the rapid quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in the predicted series, leaving the business
4

cycle variation and the longer-term trends.

Given these two auxiliary assumptions, we can use the model to produce a predicted path of
unemployment for any given set of parameters. The predicted unemployment rate in any period
4

There are two natural hypotheses to explain the high-frequency variation predicted by the model
without the filter. (1) Some high-frequency variation in productivity growth and inflation is
measurement error. (2) The high-frequency variation in productivity growth and inflation in the
data is real, but for some reason, employment responds more sluggishly in the world than it does in
our model. Very possibly, each explanation has an element of truth.
17

depends on the history of shocks to inflation and productivity.

Parameter Estimation
The next issue is how to choose the parameters. We estimate the parameters of the
univariate processes for inflation and productivity growth as autoregressions using ordinary least
squares. We then invert these autoregressions to obtain {ρj} and {ηj}, the parameters of the moving
average representations. The residuals from the autoregressions are the shocks, {εt} and {vt}, that
we feed into the model to explain fluctuations in unemployment.
The remaining three parameters are λ, δ0, and δ1/α. (The parameters α and δ1 are not
separately identified.) We estimate these parameters using a least-squares procedure. That is, we
choose these parameters to minimize the sum of squared deviations between predicted and actual
unemployment.
The results from this procedure have a simple interpretation. The estimated δ0 equals the
mean unemployment rate. The estimated δ1/α ensures that the prediction error is not correlated with
the predicted value. These two parameters do not affect the autocorrelations of predicted
unemployment or the cross-correlations between predicted and actual. In some sense, these
parameters aren't interesting: Changing δ0 and δ1/α alters the mean and variance of predicted
unemployment without altering the dynamics in any other way.
The interesting parameter is λ, which measures the rate of information arrival. Our least
squares procedure picks this parameter to make the model fit the data. In particular, it picks the

18

value for λ that maximizes the correlation between predicted and actual unemployment.

Data and Results
We use quarterly, seasonally adjusted U.S. data from the first quarter of 1959 to the first
quarter of 2001. Inflation is measured by the consumer price index. Productivity growth is the
growth of output per hour in the business sector. Unemployment is the civilian unemployment rate.
The univariate autoregressions indicate that inflation and productivity growth follow very
different stochastic processes. Productivity growth is indistinguishable from white noise, indicating
no persistence. By contrast, inflation is well modelled as an AR(3) with autoregressive parameters
0.37, 0.22, and 0.29. These three coefficients on lagged inflation sum to 0.88, indicating that
inflation is borderline nonstationary. We use the white noise specification for productivity growth
and the AR(3) parameters for inflation to calculate the moving average parameters and the
5

estimated innovations.

Next we fit the model using the unemployment data. The estimated value of λ, the rate of
information arrival, is 0.25. This means that wage setters in the economy update their information

5

When we tried using an estimated AR(3) process for productivity growth, the results were
almost the same as those reported here, because the estimated autoregressive coefficients were so
small. Notice that the case we use, according to which the level of productivity follows a random
walk, is similar to the specifications commonly used in the real business cycle literature. Exploring
alternative processes may be fruitful in future work. If we had assumed a stochastic process with a
slowly changing conditional mean (such as an IMA(1,1) process with a large, negative MA
parameter), then employment would be related to productivity growth minus a weighted average of
past productivity growth. This specification would more closely resemble the one in Ball and
Moffitt (2001). See also Grubb, Jackman and Layard (1982, section 5) for a related earlier work.
19

on average every 4 quarters. Figure 3 shows the actual and predicted unemployment rate using this
estimate. The correlation between these two series is 0.47.
Figure 4 decomposes the predicted unemployment rate from Figure 3 into two pieces. The
top panel shows the piece of predicted unemployment that is driven by inflation innovations. The
bottom panel shows the piece of predicted unemployment that is driven by productivity
innovations. Actual unemployment is shown in both panels, and all the parameters are held constant
at the same values as in Figure 3.
The figure shows that inflation and productivity innovations are both important for
explaining unemployment. The correlation of unemployment with the inflation piece of the
predicted series is 0.33. The correlation of unemployment with the productivity piece is 0.17.
Inspection of Figure 4 reveals an anomaly: Unemployment as predicted by productivity
innovations moves in advance of actual unemployment. Although this piece of predicted
unemployment has a correlation with contemporaneous unemployment of only 0.17, its correlation
with unemployment one year ahead is 0.48. Productivity appears to take more time to influence
unemployment in the world than it does in our model.
As a rough (and, we admit, ad hoc) fix for this lagged response, we add a four-quarter delay
to the estimated model. The employment equation becomes
∞
∞
α et = Σ γj εt-j + Σ ψj vt-j-4.
j=0
j=0
Otherwise, the model and estimation procedure are the same. The estimate of λ is now 0.26, almost
20

identical to our earlier estimate. The predicted and actual unemployment rates, shown in Figure 5,
now have a correlation of 0.60. Adding this lag in the effect of productivity significantly improves
the model's fit.
In the end, the empirical verdict on this model is mixed. On the one hand, the model fails to
capture some important dynamics in the data. The delay between productivity innovations and
6

unemployment is a puzzle. On the other hand, inflation and productivity surprises can account for
much of the observed evolution in U.S. unemployment. The simulation in Figure 5 captures many
of the main features of the unemployment data, including the big recessions in 1975 and 1982, the
rising trend level of unemployment rate during the 1970s and early 1980s, and the declining
unemployment rate in the late 1990s.
There are many ways in which this empirical model could be improved. The model
excludes many determinants of unemployment, such as changing demographics, unionization, and
minimum wage laws. It also excludes many shocks that might shift the inflation-unemployment
relationship, such as exchange rates, food and energy prices, and wage-price controls. The only
inputs into these simulations are inflation and productivity surprises. Absent changes in measured
productivity, the model interprets all movements in inflation as driven by aggregate demand.
Incorporating other sources of unemployment and inflation fluctuations into the model, and adding

This delay in the response to productivity shocks may be related to the mechanism highlighted
in Basu, Fernald, and Kimball (1998). If prices are sticky in the short run, then a good productivity
shock can reduce employment, because firms need fewer workers to produce the same level of
output. Another possibility is that the short-run changes in measured labor productivity are a
reflection of labor hoarding over the business cycle, rather than exogenous movements in true
productivity.

we leave for future work.

V. Conclusion
Since Friedman (1968) and Phelps (1967,1968) introduced the natural rate hypothesis in the
1960s, expectations have played a central role in understanding the dynamics of inflation and
employment. Early empirical work testing the hypothesis was based on the assumption of adaptive
expectations, according to which expected inflation is a weighted average of past inflation. Yet
Lucas (1972) and Sargent (1971) forcefully criticized that approach. Since then, economists have
most often relied on the assumption of rational expectations.
Over time, however, economists have increasingly realized that while agents may be too
smart to form expectations adaptively, they may not be smart enough to form them rationally.
Unfortunately, finding a safe haven between the stupidity of adaptive expectations and the hyperintelligence of rational expectations is not easy. Friedman (1979), Summers (1986), and Sargent
(1999) have explored the possibility that least-squares learning can help explain how expectations
evolve over time. Sims (2001) has suggested modelling agents' limited capacity for processing
information. Ball (2000) has proposed that agents form optimal univariate forecasts, but ignore the
possible gains from multivariate forecasts. Each of these approaches has some appeal, but each
lacks the parsimony that makes rational expectations so compelling.
Like all these efforts, the sticky-information model we have explored here and in our

22

previous paper attempts to model agents that are smart, but not too smart. Our agents form
expectations rationally, but they do not do so often. Because of either costs of acquiring information
or costs of recomputing optimal plans, information diffuses slowly throughout the population. As a
result, expectations conditional on old information continue to influence current behavior.
Recently, many economists have been pursuing "behavioral economics," a research program
that tries to incorporate the insights of psychology into economics. The starting point of this work is
the observation that people are not quite as rational as the homo economicus assumed in standard
models. The sticky-information model of inflation-employment dynamics can be viewed as a
modest contribution to this literature. The closest antecedent is the work of Gabaix and Laibson
(2001), which tries to explain consumption behavior and the equity premium puzzle by assuming
that consumers are slow to recognize changes in the values of their portfolios. The stickyinformation model we have presented here applies the analogous assumption to the process of wage
setting.
From a theoretical standpoint, assuming sticky information is an attempt to have your cake
and eat it too. Like many previous efforts, our model tries to describe agents who do not fully
understand their environment and gradually learn about it over time. This lack of full understanding
motivates our application of Calvo's assumption of Poisson adjustment to the acquisition of
information. Whether this approach is the best way to model the imperfections of human behavior
is hard to say. But without doubt, it has a major advantage: Once this leap of faith is taken, the
powerful tools of rational expectations become available to solve for the resulting equilibrium.

23

Of course, the validity of this model of inflation-unemployment dynamics is ultimately an
empirical question. The model fits some broad stylized facts. In our previous paper, we showed that
the model can explain the dynamic response of the economy to monetary policy: It can explain why
disinflations are costly, why monetary shocks have a delayed and gradual effect on inflation, and
why changes in inflation are positively correlated with the level of economic activity. This paper
has moved the analysis to the labor market and introduced a role for productivity as a driving force.
The model can now explain why productivity slowdowns, such as the one that occurred in the
1970s, are associated with rising unemployment (and a rising NAIRU) and why productivity
accelerations, such as the one that occurred in the United States in the 1990s, are associated with
declining unemployment (and a declining NAIRU). When we applied the model to U.S. time series
data, we found that inflation and productivity surprises account for a sizable fraction of observed
unemployment fluctuations.
The model proposed here suggests a possible problem with the policy of inflation targeting
that many of the world's central banks adopted during the 1990s. In this model, stabilizing
employment in the face of a productivity slowdown requires a rise in the inflation rate of an equal
magnitude. The model suggests that a better nominal anchor than the price of goods and services is
nominal income or the nominal wage. Targeting inflation in the price of labor, rather than in the
price of goods and services, is a policy rule that deserves a closer look.

Appendix:
This appendix formally justifies some of the claims asserted in the body of the paper.

The sticky-information Phillips Curve.

(A1)

The three equations describing wage setting, together with the demand for labor lead to:
∞
j
pt = { λ Σ (1 - λ) Et-j [ pt + αet + θt ] } - θt.
j=0

Take out the first term to obtain:
(A2)

∞
j+1
pt = λ [ pt + αet + θt ] + { λ Σ (1 - λ) Et-1-j [ pt + αet + θt ] } - θt
j=0

and subtract the pt-1 version of (A1) from (A2) to obtain, after some rearranging:
∞
j
(A3)
πt = λ [ pt + αet + θt ] + { λ Σ (1 - λ) Et-1-j [πt + α∆et + ∆θt ] }
j=0
∞
j
- λ Σ (1 - λ) Et-1-j [ pt + αet + θt ] } - ∆θt
j=0
2

where ∆ is the first difference operator and the inflation rate is πt = ∆pt. Multiplying through
equation (A2) by λ and rearranging, we get:
∞
2
j
(A4)
(1 – λ) λ Σ (1 - λ) Et-1-j [ pt + αet + θt ] =
j=0
= λ [ (1 – λ) pt - λαet + (1 - λ) θt].
Replacing (A4) for the last term in (A3) leads to, after rearranging, the sticky information
Phillips Curve:
25

∞
j
πt = [ αλ / (1 - λ) ] et - ∆θt + λ Σ (1 - λ) Et-1-j (πt + ∆θt + α∆et ).
j=0
The response of employment and inflation to a fall in the growth rate of aggregate demand
and productivity.
(A5)

Replacing for yt using the aggregate demand equation into the aggregate supply equation,
we obtain the law of motion for the price level:
∞
j
(A6)
pt = { λ Σ (1 - λ) Et-j [ (1 - α/β) pt + (α/β) mt + (1 - α) θt ] } - θt.
j=0
First, say that mt was growing at the rate 0.005, up to date –1, when it reaches the level 0.
Then, unexpectedly, the growth rate falls to 0, so mt stays at level 0 forever. Formally: mt=
0.005(1+t) for t≤-1 and mt= 0 for t≥0. Also, set θt= 0 for all t. Then, we can break equation (A6)
into two components:
(A7)

t
j
pt = λ Σ (1 - λ) Et-j [ (1 - α/β) pt + (α/β) mt ] +
j=0
∞
j
+ λ Σ (1 - λ) Et-j [ (1 - α/β) pt + (α/β) mt ].
j=t+1

In the first summation term are included the agents that set their expectations after the change in
mt. Thus, they set expectations with full information: Et-j(pt)= pt and Et-j(mt)= 0. In the second
summation term are agents who set expectations prior to the change: Et-j(pt)= Et-j(mt)=
0.005(1+t). Thus, (A7) becomes:
(A8)

t+1

pt = (1 - α/β) (1 - (1 - λ)

t+1

) pt + 0.005 (1+t) (1-λ)

which, after rearranging, gives the solution:
(A9)

t+1

pt = [ 0.005 (1 + t) (1 - λ)

t+1

] / [ 1 - (1 - α/β) (1 - (1-λ) ) ].
26

Employment is given by et= - pt/β and inflation is πt = ∆pt.
The fall in productivity is formalised as: θt= 0.005(1+t) for t≤-1 and θt= 0 for t≥0, and
mt= 0 for all t. Starting again from (A6) we obtain, by very similar steps, the response of prices:
(A10)

t+1

pt = [ 0.005 (1 - β) (1 + t)(1 - λ)

t+1

] / [1 - (1 - α/β) (1 - (1 - λ) )].

Inflation and employment follow immediately.

Proof of the Proposition and Corollary.
Starting from (A1), replacing for pt from the aggregate demand equation and for yt from
the production function, we obtain the expectational difference equation for employment as a
function of the two exogenous processes, mt and θt:
∞
j
(A11)
βet = mt + (1 - β) θt – λ Σ (1-λ) Et-j [ mt + (1 - β) θt + (α - β) et ] }.
j=0
If we define the composite disturbance: mt + (1-β)θt, employment is solely driven by this
term. Shocks to mt or (1-β)θt have exactly the same effect on the equation above and thus on
employment. This shows the Proposition. The Corollary follows from setting β=1 in (A11) and
noting that θt does not enter the stochastic equation determining employment.

27

Stabilization Policy and Productivity Change.
Start with the stable employment policy. From (A11), it follows that if mt = -(1-β)θt then
we obtain an expectational difference equation involving only et, which has solution et = 0. This
is the policy that stabilizes employment. Given the path for θt above, we then have the policy
path mt, and since we know this ensures et = 0, then yt= θt from the production function. The path
of prices pt comes from the aggregate demand equation pt= -θt. A permanent drop in the growth
rate of productivity therefore leads to a permanent rise in inflation.
Alternatively, note that combining the wage curve and the labor demand (output supply)
equations into the equation for the aggregate wage we obtain:
∞
j
(A12)
wt = λ Σ (1 - λ) Et-j [ wt + αet ].
j=0
From (A12), having the wage rate equal to some forever known constant ensures et = 0. Without
loss of generality, set that constant to zero. The associated policy is mt = -(1-β)θt, from using the
aggregate demand equation and the production function. Thus, an employment stabilization
policy is equivalent to a policy that stabilizes the wage rate in the sense of having wt
deterministic or known to all.
Similarly, use the labor demand and the production function equations to replace for wt
and θt in (A12) above and obtain:
∞
j
(A13)
pt + yt – et = λ Σ (1-λ) Et-j [ pt + yt + (1-α)et ].
j=0
Thus, by the same argument as above, stabilizing nominal income pt + yt is equivalent to
stabilizing employment.
We now turn attention to inflation targeting. Without loss of generality we set the target
28

to zero, and the level to zero as well, so the policy aim is to have pt = 0 at all periods. From the
law of motion for the price level in (A6) and the set path for prices:
∞
j
(A14)
θt = λ Σ (1 - λ) Et-j [ (α/β) mt + (1 - α) θt ].
j=0
Given a path for θt, the necessary path of policy is given by the solution to this equation. For t ≤ 1, all agents have full information and θt = 0.005(1+t) so the policy is: mt = 0.005β (1+t). For t≥0,
breaking the sum in two components, the first referring to informed agents that set their
expectations at or after date 0, and the second to uninformed agents that set their expectations
before date 0, we obtain:
(A15)

t+1

0 = (α/β) ( 1 - (1 - λ)

t+1

) mt + 0.005 (1 + t) (1 - λ)

which, after rearranging, becomes:
(A16)

t+1

mt = - [ 0.005 β (1 + t)(1 - λ)

t+1

] / [ α - α (1 - λ) ].

The path for employment for t ≥ 0 is et = yt = mt/β.

Empirical implementation.
Since the only forces driving employment are inflation and productivity growth, the
general solution for employment will be a linear function (with undetermined coefficients) of the
shocks to these variables:
∞
(A17)
α et = Σ ( γj εt-j + ψj vt-j ).
j=0
Using the MA representations for inflation, productivity growth and employment, plugging these
in the equation for employment in the main text and taking the relevant expectations, we obtain:
29

∞
∞
Σ (γj εt-j + ψj vt-j) = [ (1 - λ) / λ ] [Σ ( ρj εt-j + ηj vt-j ) j=0
j=0

j=0
i=j+1
∞
∞
j
+ { λ Σ (1 - λ) Σ (γi εt-i-1 + ψi vt-i-1 ) } ].
j=0
i=j
Matching coefficients gives the solution:
(A19)

γ0 = [ (1 - λ) / λ] ρ0

(A20)

γj = [ (1 - λ)

(A21)

ψ0 = [ (1 - λ) / λ ] η0

) ) ] ψj-1.

Given the MA parameters ρj and ηj, and a series for the shocks εt and vt (all of which we
obtain by OLS regressions on the data) we can generate a predicted employment series from
(A17), which after applying the triangular filter in the text produces a series for smoothed
s

employment: e t. Note then first that, from (A17) and the additive nature of the smoother, 1/α
s

factors out of the expressions for e t. Second, that since ρj, ηj, εt, and vt are determined by first stage
OLS regressions, the only parameter left determining predicted smooth employment is λ, so that we
s

can write αe t=g(λ), where g(.) is the function defined by (A17) and (A19) to (A22). The formula
for our predicted unemployment series is:
(A23)

ût = δ0 – (δ1/α) g(λ)

We pick parameters by non-linear least squares to minimize the sum of squares residuals:
