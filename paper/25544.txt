ABSTRACT
How do international trade shocks affect spatially connected regional markets? We answer this
question by extending shift-share empirical specifications to incorporate general equilibrium
effects that arise in spatial models. In partial equilibrium, regional shock exposure has a shiftshare structure: it is the average shock weighted by regional exposure shares in revenue and
consumption. General equilibrium responses of employment and wages in each market are the
sum, across all regions, of these shift-share measures times bilateral reduced-form elasticities
determined by the economy's spatial links. We use this reduced-form representation of the model
to efficiently estimate the bilateral elasticities exploiting exogenous variation in shock exposure
across markets. Finally, we study the general equilibrium impact of the “China shock” on U.S.
CZs using our model-consistent generalization of the specification in Autor et al. (2013). We find
that indirect effects from the shock exposure of other markets reinforce the negative impact of the
market's own shock exposure, leading to employment and wage losses that are significantly larger
than those reported in the existing literature.

Introduction

What are the labor market consequences of international trade shocks, such as a trade policy change
or a foreign productivity boom? Answering this question requires quasi-experimental variation
in trade shocks affecting different labor markets. A growing literature obtains such a variation
from regional measures of exposure to trade shocks that are constructed from the interaction
of aggregate shocks and associated region-specific exposure shares, as in the shift-share designs
in Autor et al. (2013) and Kovak (2013). These measures yield estimates of how labor market
outcomes differentially respond in regions with higher shock exposure. However, these differential
responses may not fully capture all the channels through which trade shocks affect regional labor
markets in general equilibrium. Such is the case if spatial connections imply that the shock exposure
of a region not only affects its own labor market, but also has spillover effects on other regions.
Without estimates of this type of spatial spillover effects, any analysis of the general equilibrium
impact of trade shocks on local labor markets is incomplete.1
In this paper, we analyze how trade shocks affect local labor markets by extending shift-share
empirical specifications to incorporate the general equilibrium effects that arise from spatial links
in a flexible model. We first show that a market’s shock exposure in partial equilibrium can be
written in terms of two shift-share variables based on market-specific exposure shares for revenue
and consumption. We then establish that, in general equilibrium, responses of employment and
wages in each market are the sum, across all regions, of these shift-share measures times bilateral
reduced-form elasticities determined by the economy’s spatial links. Thus, though the lens of our
spatial model, these reduced-form elasticities are sufficient for computing the general equilibrium
impact of observed measures of regional shock exposure on local labor market outcomes. We then
show how to efficiently estimate these elasticities using the model’s reduced-form representation for
employment and wage responses to exogenous variation in the shock exposure of different markets.
Finally, we study the impact of the ‘‘China shock’’ on U.S. Commuting Zones (CZs). Our theory
yields a generalization of the shift-share specification in Autor et al. (2013) that accounts for both
the direct effect of the CZ’s own shock exposure in revenue and consumption, as well as the indirect
effect of the shock exposures of other CZs. We find that indirect effects reinforce direct effects,
leading to employment and wage losses that are significantly larger than those reported in the
existing literature.
We consider a general equilibrium framework with three types of spatial links. Every market
has multiple sectors, each featuring a gravity-type demand for the goods from different markets.
Local labor supply is endogenous: it depends on wages and prices in all markets. Finally, we allow
for local economies of scale and spatial productivity spillovers by making local labor productivity a
1

This is related to the well-known problem that difference-in-difference empirical strategies do not recover the
general equilibrium effect of the ‘‘treated’’ on ‘‘non-treated’’, as pointed out by Heckman et al. (1998) and, more
recently, by Muendler (2017) in the context of regional regressions.

function of employment in all markets. Through the shape of the functions specifying spatial links
in the economy, our model encompasses several of the mechanisms in existing trade and spatial
frameworks – for example, the gravity trade models reviewed by Costinot and Rodrı́guez-Clare
(2014) and the spatial models reviewed in Moretti (2011) and Redding and Rossi-Hansberg (2017).
We start by expressing equilibrium wages and employment in terms of each market’s excess
labor demand. This way studying the impact of trade shocks in our spatial framework becomes a
traditional comparative statics exercise in general equilibrium – see e.g. Arrow and Hahn (1971). In
partial equilibrium, for any given initial wage vector, trade shocks trigger shifts in the excess labor
demand of each market. In general equilibrium, wages and employment in all markets respond to
these partial equilibrium shifts to guarantee labor market clearing everywhere. Such responses
depend on the Jacobian matrix of the excess demand system with respect to wages. This is the
‘‘spatial links’’ matrix that summarizes the combined strength of different types of spatial links.
We then separately analyze these two components of the impact of trade shocks on local
labor markets. We first show that the partial equilibrium shifts in excess labor demand can be
written in terms of two shift-share variables, given by the sum of the product of trade shocks and
market-specific exposure shares for revenue and consumption. For sectoral foreign productivity
shocks, a market’s revenue exposure is the commonly used shift-share variable based on sectoral
employment shares – e.g., Autor et al. (2013) and Kovak (2013). In addition, our theory yields
a consumption exposure measure that is a shift-share variable where the ‘‘share’’ is instead the
sectoral spending share.
In general equilibrium, responses of employment and wages in each market are the sum, across
all markets, of their partial equilibrium excess demand shifts multiplied by bilateral reduced-form
elasticities. These general equilibrium reduced-form elasticities control how much the shift in
a market’s excess labor demand affects directly its own market and indirectly other markets.
Depending on their sign, indirect reduced-form elasticities may reinforce or attenuate the direct
effect of the market’s own excess demand shift. Thus, in our spatial model, these elasticities are
ex-ante sufficient statistics that allow the general equilibrium aggregation of excess demand shifts
across markets.
We open the black-box of spatial shock propagation in the economy by writing the reduced-form
elasticities as a series expansion of the spatial links matrix. This implies that bilateral reduced-form
elasticities are larger between markets with stronger spatial links, due to tighter bilateral or
third-market connections (e.g., similar compositions of trade partners and sectoral employment, or
tighter labor supply links).2 Only when spatial links are identical for all markets, bilateral indirect
effects are identical and yield a common endogenous variable that is absorbed by time fixed-effects.
2

Intuitively, this arises from the several adjustment rounds triggered by the response of each market’s excess
labor demand to shock-induced wage changes elsewhere. This is similar to the channel creating percolation of
sectoral shocks in production networks, as in Acemoglu et al. (2012) and Acemoglu et al. (2016).

2

We further show that, if trade demand links are strong enough, indirect and direct effects have the
same sign and, therefore, reinforce each other.
Taken together, our theoretical results point to two critical components of any empirical analysis
of how trade shocks affect local labor markets: (i) the partial equilibrium shock exposure in revenue
and consumption, and (ii) the general equilibrium reduced-form elasticities to the shock exposure
of different markets. Accordingly, we build on these two components to propose a new empirical
methodology to study the labor market consequences of trade shocks.
To this end, we use the reduced-form representation of our general equilibrium model to specify
how regional outcomes respond to an observed trade shock and other unobserved shocks. We
combine the observed trade shock with trade data to compute the revenue and consumption
exposures of each market. Our model yields two estimating equations linking observed changes
in employment and wages in each market to linear combinations of the product of reduced-form
elasticities and observed measures of shock exposure across markets, as well as additive unobserved
residuals. We proceed in two steps to estimate the reduced-form elasticities using these equations
and exogenous cross-regional variation in shock exposure.
First, we reduce the dimensionality of the reduced-form elasticity matrix by imposing that
spatial links are known functions of observables and parameters. Thus, we only need to estimate
the parameters regulating the strength of reduced-form effects associated with different observed
variables (e.g., bilateral flows in migration and sectoral trade).3 We obtain moment conditions
to estimate these parameters by assuming that the observed shock exposure is mean-independent
of unobserved residuals. This assumption is the same orthogonality condition underlying the
shift-share strategies in Kovak (2013) and Autor et al. (2013). Notice however that our estimating
equations generalize the specifications in this literature: they include direct and indirect reducedform elasticities to the shock exposures in both revenue and consumption.
Second, we characterize the efficient estimator of the parameters that non-linearly regulate the
general equilibrium reduced-form elasticities. We outline a class of consistent GMM estimators for
the parameter vector that differ in how they aggregate the shock exposure of different markets.
We follow Chamberlain (1987) to characterize the ‘‘optimal’’ variance-minimizing estimator within
this class and its two-step feasible implementation. For each market, the model-implied optimal
moment puts more weight on the observed exposure of markets whose bilateral reduced-form
elasticities are more sensitive to changes in the parameter of interest.4
In the last part of the paper, we apply our methodology to study the impact of the ‘‘China
3

Our approach is similar to the common practice in demand estimation of projecting cross-price elasticities on
product characteristics – see e.g. Berry (1994), Berry et al. (1995) and, for a review, Nevo (2000).
4
The approach of Chamberlain (1987) has been used in partial equilibrium models by Berry et al. (1995),
Petrin (2002), and Reynaert and Verboven (2014). Our contribution is, for a flexible spatial model in general
equilibrium, to formally establish a class of consistent estimators and among them the optimal estimator and its
feasible implementation.

shock’’ on U.S. Commuting Zones (CZs), as in Autor et al. (2013) (henceforth ADH). We follow
ADH by considering the exposure of each CZ to industry-level Chinese export growth to a group
of developed countries (excluding the U.S.). In this case, the model-consistent revenue exposure
is proportional to the shift-share instrument in ADH. However, our theory predicts that regional
outcomes also respond to (i) the CZ’s own consumption shift, and (ii) indirectly to the revenue and
consumption shifts of other CZs. Therefore, we begin our empirical analysis by estimating a simple
extension of the specification in ADH with the goal of qualitatively investigating the relevance
of these two additional channels. We impose that each market’s indirect effect is proportional to
the average shock exposure of all other markets, weighted by their inverse bilateral distance. We
find that, conditional on a CZ’s own revenue exposure, growth of both employment and wages
are significantly lower if nearby CZs suffer larger revenue shocks. In our theory, these reinforcing
indirect effects are consistent with strong trade demand links across CZs (relative to labor supply
links). In addition, we do not find evidence that regional outcomes significantly respond to shifts
in consumption cost. This suggests weak labor supply responses to lower import costs.5
We then implement our methodology to estimate the general equilibrium reduced-form elasticities implied by our parametrization of the spatial links matrix. This allows general equilibrium
reduced-form elasticities to depend on bilateral as well as third-market connections that arise in
general equilibrium. In addition, it implies that, through the lens of our spatial model, neither
time fixed-effects nor residuals include any component of the endogenous responses of regional
outcomes to the observed sectoral average of the China shock. In line with the evidence discussed
above, we find that the direct and indirect effects of revenue exposure have the same sign. These
indirect reinforcing effects are mostly driven by spatial trade links. We estimate large reduced-form
elasticities that are consistent with strong amplification through local economies of scale. In
addition, a reduction in consumption cost has a positive direct and indirect impact on wages and
employment. However, the positive responses to consumption cost shifts are much weaker than
the negative responses to revenue shifts.
To gain confidence in our methodology, we propose a way of evaluating a spatial model’s
predictions based on their ability to match the impact of regional shock exposure on labor market
outcomes across CZs – in line with the evaluation strategy suggested by Kehoe (2005). Specifically,
we regress actual changes in employment and wages of U.S. CZs on the model-predicted responses
to the China shock. We find that the estimated fit coefficients are close to one for our baseline
predicted responses, indicating that their magnitude is consistent with the shock’s differential
5

We construct CZ-level sectoral spending shares using the CZ’s sectoral employment shares interacted with
national input-output matrices, so they capture also the CZ’s input spending on different sectors. Thus, this result
indicates that we do not find evidence of stronger employment growth in CZs intensively using inputs from industries
with larger increases in Chinese exports. This is consistent with the evidence in Pierce and Schott (2016) and
Acemoglu et al. (2016) who do not find a significant response of an industry’s employment to stronger Chinese
export growth in the industries supplying its inputs.

impact on employment and wages across CZs.6
Using the same methodology, we evaluate the fit implied by typical specifications of spatial
links in the quantitative spatial literature. We find that they perform poorly: the fit coefficient is
much higher than one and, depending on the specification, very imprecisely estimated. This finding
indicates a troubling disconnect between the results of empirical analyses using cross-regional
variation in shock exposure and those of quantitative analyses using general equilibrium spatial
models. It implies that common specifications of spatial links generate regional responses to the
China shock that are too small compared to –and often uncorrelated with– actual changes in
employment and wages across CZs. We show that these results follow mainly from specifying weak
agglomeration forces and strong sensitivity of employment to import prices.
Finally, we compute the impact of the China shock on U.S. CZs by aggregating their exposure
to the China shock using our estimates of the general equilibrium reduced-form elasticities. On
average, revenue losses dominate consumption gains, reducing employment and wage log-growth
respectively by 2.8 and 4 log-points between 1990 and 2007. The consumption gains however lead
to a small increase in the average real wage of 0.2 log-points. These responses vary substantially
across CZs: the standard deviation of log-changes is 1.3 for wages, 3.3 for employment, and 1.7 for
real wages. These employment and wage losses are significantly larger than those in the existing
literature. Empirical specifications ignoring indirect reinforcing effects yield smaller losses. In
addition, quantitative frameworks yield average responses that are close to zero because they rely
on reduced-form elasticities that are too small compared to those necessary to match the observed
cross-regional responses to the shock.
Building on the seminal works of Bartik (1991) and Blanchard and Katz (1992), a growing
literature uses shift-share strategies to estimate how regional markets respond to economic shocks,
in general, and trade shocks, in particular – see e.g. Topalova (2010), Autor et al. (2013), Kovak
(2013), Dix-Carneiro and Kovak (2017), Autor et al. (2016), Pierce and Schott (2020) and Burstein
et al. (2020). Moving beyond the differential responses documented in this literature, we propose a
generalization of this empirical approach that captures the indirect general equilibrium impact of
the shock exposures of different markets. Through the lens of our spatial model, such estimates
can be used to aggregate the shock exposure of different regions to obtain the general equilibrium
responses of local labor market outcomes.7
Our work provides a bridge between this empirical literature and the alternative popular
approach used to study the labor market consequences of trade shocks: quantitative analyses using
6

While we use this methodology to evaluate regional outcomes, the same logic can be applied to evaluate
outcomes such as bilateral trade or commuting flows, see e.g. Dingel and Tiltenot (2020).
7
Heterogeneity in spatial links also implies heterogeneity in the direct ‘‘treatment’’ effect of the own market’s
shock exposure – as shown by Monte et al. (2018). In a recent related paper, Hornbeck and Moretti (2018) empirically
document indirect effects of regional productivity shocks through out-migration to other regions. Instead, we focus
on the implications of spatial links for the measurement of shock exposure in partial equilibrium and the estimation
of indirect reduced-form elasticities in general equilibrium.

general equilibrium spatial models. Several papers point out the challenge of extrapolating general
equilibrium counterfactual predictions from estimated differential responses across regions – see
e.g. Moretti (2011); Kline and Moretti (2014); Beraja et al. (2019); Muendler (2017); Kehoe et al.
(2017); Redding and Rossi-Hansberg (2017). This motivated recent analyses based on quantitative
spatial frameworks studying the effects of import growth from China on local labor markets in
the U.S. – see e.g. Galle et al. (2017) and Caliendo et al. (2019). We depart in two ways from
this quantitative approach. First, we characterize the reduced-form representation of our general
equilibrium model that links actual changes in employment and wages to shift-share measures of
regional shock exposure in revenue and consumption. Second, we use this representation to obtain
estimating equations that can be used to identify parameters regulating the general equilibrium
reduced-form elasticities of local outcomes to the shock exposure of different markets. Thus, our
approach is an extension of existing shift-share empirical specifications that allows the aggregation
of regional shock exposure in a way that is consistent with the predictions of general equilibrium
spatial models.8 As a result, compared to common specifications of spatial links in quantitative
frameworks, our methodology yields a substantially better fit for the differential response of
labor market outcomes to shock exposure across regions, increasing the credibility of the model’s
counterfactual predictions.
Finally, our paper is related to the so-called ‘‘market access’’ approach in Redding and Venables
(2004) that has been recently used to study how regional labor markets respond to economic shocks
in general equilibrium – e.g., Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016); Alder et al. (2015); Bartelme (2018).
Our model-consistent exposure measures correspond to partial equilibrium versions of the changes
in producer and consumer market access in this literature, if the latter were computed holding
wages and employment constant. Our exposure measures can be immediately constructed using
trade data and can be aggregated in a model consistent-way using our estimates of the general
equilibrium reduced-form elasticities. Market access measures are instead endogenous variables
obtained from solving the general equilibrium model under restrictive assumptions and whose
aggregation requires additional general equilibrium shifters.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes our spatial model. Section 3
characterizes the partial equilibrium exposure measures and the general equilibrium reduced-form
elasticities. Section 4 presents the linear expressions for changes in wages and employment in
terms of the exposure measures. Section 5 describes our methodology to estimate the reduced-form
elasticities using these expressions. In Section 6, we estimate the impact of the China shock on
U.S. CZs. Section 7 concludes.
8

Note that our methodology is different from that used in papers exploiting cross-regional variation in shock
exposure to estimate parameters of particular structural equations of the model – e.g., Faber and Gaubert (2019);
Fajgelbaum et al. (2018); Galle et al. (2017); Allen et al. (2020); Burstein et al. (2020). This is because they do
not explicitly characterize nor estimate the model-implied reduced-form elasticities of regional outcomes to shock
exposure.

Model

We consider a spatial general equilibrium model in which N ‘‘markets’’ are linked through trade
flows, labor productivity, and labor supply. Each ‘‘market’’ i consists of a set of sectors, s ∈ Si ,
within a geographic unit r where producers face identical endogenous production costs.9 In the
rest of the paper, we use bold variables to denote stacked vectors of market outcomes, x ≡ {xi }i ,
and bar bold variables to denote matrices with bilateral variables associated with origin market i
and destination market j, x̄ ≡ [xij ]i,j .
Labor Supply Labor is freely mobile within a market, so that wi is market i’s wage. Labor
supply in i, Li , is a function of the vectors of wages, w ≡ {wj }, and price indices, P ≡ {Pj }:
Li = Φi (w, P ),

(1)

where Φi (· ) is strictly positive, differentiable, bounded, and homogeneous of degree zero.
We use the matrices of labor supply elasticities to changes in wages and prices to summarize
the economy’s spatial links in labor supply,
φw
ij ≡

∂ ln Φi (w, P )
∂ ln wj

and φpij ≡

∂ ln Φi (w, P )
.
∂ ln Pj

(2)

p
The own-market elasticities, φw
ii and φii , control the response of employment to changes in
the market’s wages and prices. They allow employment to respond to the regional exposure to
import competition – as documented in Autor et al. (2013) and Dix-Carneiro and Kovak (2017).
Our specification allows, but does not require, employment responses to wages and prices to be
different. As discussed below, this implies that our model can match different types of employment
responses to shocks in import competition and import prices. This is important given the evidence
in Acemoglu et al. (2016) and Pierce and Schott (2016) that these shocks have different implications
p
for employment growth across industries. Finally, the cross-market elasticities, φw
ij and φij , regulate
employment responses in market i to wages and prices in other markets, capturing endogenous
employment changes across markets – as in the literature reviewed by Moretti (2011).
Our general labor supply specification Φi (w, P ) encompasses the labor supply function implied
by several micro-founded frameworks – for a formal discussion, see Online Appendix B. It can
replicate the labor supply functions in spatial models with homogeneous individuals facing housing
congestion forces, as in Helpman (1998), and heterogeneous individuals in market-specific amenity
preferences, as in Allen and Arkolakis (2014), Redding (2016), and Bryan and Morten (2015).10
9

Each market in our model can be seen as a group of industries within a geographic unit at a point in time. For
example, a market may be the set of manufacturing industries in a U.S. Commuting Zone.
10
If a market is a group of industries in a region, then Φj (w, P ) can also replicate the industry-level labor supply

7

Our specification also allows aggregate employment to respond to changes in wages and prices.
The fact that labor supply is a separate function of wages and price indices may arise from
the endogenous labor supply choice in the presence of unemployment benefits when preferences
either imply income effects on leisure demand, as in Shimer (2009) and Keane (2011), or entail
heterogeneity in the disutility to work across individuals, as in Rogerson (1988) and Chetty (2012).
In fact, without migration, these two settings imply that labor supply is more sensitive to the
p
market’s wage than to the price index, φw
ii > −φii > 0. We show that this feature is key to match
employment responses to trade shock exposure in the empirical application in Section 6.
Production The region-sector pair (r, s) in market i has a competitive representative firm whose
production function uses only labor,
Qr,s = Ψi (L) Lr,s ,

(3)

where Ψi (· ) is a strictly positive differentiable function that governs the endogenous component of
labor productivity in all sectors and regions of market i. We use the matrix of labor productivity
elasticity to changes in employment to summarize the economy’s spatial links in productivity,
ψij =

∂ ln Ψi (L)
.
∂ ln Lj

(4)

The own-market elasticity ψii captures labor productivity gains caused by higher local employment – as documented, for example, by Greenstone et al. (2010), Kline and Moretti (2014) and
Peters (2019). The cross-market elasticity ψij regulates spatial spillovers in labor productivity.
Again, different micro-founded frameworks imply that labor productivity takes the general
form in Ψi (L). A setting with ψii = ψ and ψij = 0 arises from firm entry and increasing returns to
scale with homogeneous firms, as in Krugman (1980), or heterogeneous firms, as in Arkolakis et al.
(2008) and Chaney (2008).11 By properly defining markets, our specification allows for external
economies of scale in a region-sector, as in Ethier (1982), and technology diffusion between regions,
as in Fujita et al. (1999) and Lucas and Rossi-Hansberg (2003). When markets are industry groups
in a region, our environment accommodates differences across sectors in market structure and
economies of scale – e.g., Krugman and Venables (1995), Balistreri et al. (2010), Kucheryavyy et
al. (2016). In addition, the cross-market elasticity of labor productivity, ψij , may also incorporate
congestion forces implied by the spatial re-allocation of other factors of production (see Online
Appendix B). Finally, under combined parametric restrictions on Φi (w, P ) and Ψi (L), our model
is equivalent to existing quantitative gravity spatial models, such as those reviewed by Redding
implied by assignment models with heterogeneous individuals in terms of industry-specific productivity, as in
Burstein et al. (2019); Galle et al. (2017); Adão (2015).
11
Costinot and Rodrı́guez-Clare (2014) establish this in the context of gravity trade models.

and Rossi-Hansberg (2017).12

in (1) imply that the endogenous production cost in market i, pi , is

Demand We consider a multi-sector nested CES trade demand. The spending share of j on
P
goods of sector s is constant and given by ξj,s , with s ξj,s = 1. Within sector s, the demand for
goods from different markets is a constant elasticity function. This implies that the spending share
of market j on goods produced in i is

where s > 0 is the trade elasticity in sector s, τ ≡ {τij,s }ijs is the stacked vector of bilateral trade
costs, and the summation in the denominator is over markets that produce in sector s, {o : s ∈ So }.
The sector-specific trade costs combine bilateral differences in tastes, iceberg trade costs, and
productivity. In our analysis below, we consider the consequences of exogenous changes in these
bilateral terms.
Our multi-sector gravity trade structure follows closely that of the recent quantitative gravity
literature reviewed by Costinot and Rodrı́guez-Clare (2014). In fact, when labor supply is exogenous
(i.e., Φi (w, P ) = L̄i ), our framework becomes a standard multi-sector gravity trade model with
perfect labor mobility across sectors within a market but no mobility across markets. With a single
sector, our trade demand specification is equivalent to that of the Armington model in Anderson
(1979), the Ricardian model in Eaton and Kortum (2002), and, more generally, the class of gravity
trade models in Arkolakis et al. (2012).
P
The revenue of i is Yi (p, E|τ ) = j xij (p|τ )Ej where Ej is j’s total spending. To summarize
the economy’s spatial linkages in trade, we use the elasticity of revenue to production costs,

where yij is the share of j in the revenue of i, and yij,s is the share of sector s in the sales of i
to j. Equation (7) has two properties that follow directly from our model’s multi-sector gravity
structure. First, all markets are substitutes in the trade demand: χij ≥ 0 for all i 6= j. Second,
markets i and j are closer substitutes whenever i gets more of its revenue from destinations and
P
sectors in which j’s market share is large: χij is increasing in k,s (yik yik,s )(xjk,s s ).
12

Online Appendix B shows that the formal equivalence with these settings requires specifying the regional
allocation of payments to non-labor factors (e.g., rent payments to land and capital).

entails endogenous labor supply and economies of scale.

establish uniqueness in our framework with spatial links in labor supply, labor productivity, and
trade demand. Note that, whereas proving existence in the presence of such links is straightforward
(see Mas-Colell et al. (1995) Chapter 17), characterizing uniqueness is typically harder and involves
specific parametric restrictions (e.g., see Miyao et al. (1980), Allen et al. (2020), Allen et al. (2015)).

Theory of General Equilibrium Effects in Space

We now study how exogenous changes in bilateral trade costs τij,s affect outcomes in different
markets. We use the superscript 0 to denote variables in the initial equilibrium, zj0 , and hats to
denote log changes in variables between the initial and new equilibria, ẑj ≡ ln(zj /zj0 ). Given the
normalization ŵm = 1, relative wage changes follow directly from the equilibrium definition in
terms of excess labor demand. By totally differentiating (10), we obtain

where Ȳ is the diagonal matrix of initial market revenue.
The system in (11) frames our analysis as a traditional comparative statics exercises in general
equilibrium.14 The right hand side measures the partial equilibrium shift in the excess labor demand
of each market caused by the shock (holding wages constant). The left hand side is the general
equilibrium change in excess demand, which depends on the ‘‘spatial links’’ matrix γ̄, triggered by
relative wage responses that restore labor market clearing everywhere.
Remark 1. Following shocks to bilateral trade shifters, relative wage changes combine: (i) the
vector of partial equilibrium shifts in excess labor demand, η̂(τ̂ ), and (ii) the Jacobian matrix of
the excess demand system, γ̄.
In the rest of this section, we first establish that the excess demand shift can be written in
terms of shift-share variables similar to those used to measure regional exposure to trade shocks
in a recent empirical literature – e.g., Kovak (2013) and Autor et al. (2013). We then show
that, because of the spatial links in γ̄, the general equilibrium elasticity of the wage in market i
aggregates the direct effect of i’s own demand shift and the indirect effect of the demand shift of
other markets.
It is worth noting that our analysis focuses on the elasticity of labor market outcomes to trade
cost shocks. As such, it is a good approximation for the response to small changes in trade costs.
14

For example, see sections 10.2 in Arrow and Hahn (1971) and 17.G in Mas-Colell et al. (1995). Allen et al.
(2020) use an analogous representation in a single-sector gravity economy with a logit function of effective labor
P
supply – in our notation, Φi (w, P ) = νi (wi /Pi )φ / j νj (wj /Pj )φ and Ψi (L) = Lψ
i .

11

For large shocks however, it is necessary to compute the integral of our formulas accounting for
changes in trade outcomes along the adjustment path to the new equilibrium.

3.1

Partial Equilibrium Shifts in Excess Labor Demand

Our first result characterizes partial equilibrium shifts in the only two variables directly affected
by the shock: revenue Yi and consumption cost index Pi .
Proposition 2. Partial equilibrium shifts in i’s revenue, η̂iR (τ̂ ) ≡
P
0 |τ 0 )
consumption cost, η̂iC (τ̂ ) ≡ o,s ∂ ln∂Plni (p
τ̂oi,s , are given by

and

(12)

o,s

j,o,s

Proof. See Appendix 8.2.
Equation (12) shows that the partial equilibrium shifts, η̂iR (τ̂ ) and η̂iC (τ̂ ), have a shift-share
structure: they interact the shock τ̂oj,s with i’s initial exposure in terms of revenue and consumption.
In particular, market i’s revenue is more exposed to τ̂oj,s when i’s revenue share in sector s and
0
destination j is higher (i.e., yij0 yij,s
is higher) and the spending share of j on market o is higher (i.e.,
0
xoj,s s is higher). In addition, by Shepard’s lemma, i’s consumption cost is more exposed to τ̂oi,s
when i spends more on sector s of market o (i.e., ξi,s x0oi,s is higher). Thus, given any trade shock,
the computation of η̂iR (τ̂ ) and η̂iC (τ̂ ) only requires bilateral trade flows and trade elasticities.15
We simplify the notation by denoting η̂iR (τ̂ ) and η̂iC (τ̂ ) as η̂iR and η̂iC .
To understand better η̂iR and η̂iC , consider a shock in a single origin F , τ̂ij,s = 0 for i 6= F and
τ̂F j,s 6= 0, under the assumption of s =  for all s. For i 6= F , the exposure to the sectoral average

of the demand-adjusted shock, ζ̂s ≡ N −1 j (x0F j,s τ̂F j,s ), is16

where yi,s
≡ j yij0 yij,s
is the share of sector s in market i’s revenue. Notice that yi,s is also the
share of sector s in i’s total employment since our model features a single wage rate in each market.
15

The measures η̂iR (τ̂ ) and η̂iC (τ̂ ) are the partial equilibrium (i.e. holding wages and employment constant in all
markets) impact of trade shocks on the measures of firm and consumer market access introduced in Anderson and
Van Wincoop (2003) and Redding and Venables (2004). However, while our measures can be readily recovered with
data in the initial equilibrium, the definition of market access requires solving the full general equilibrium, which is
typically done under the assumption of a single industry whose bilateral trade costs are symmetric and observed
(e.g., Redding and Sturm (2008), Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016), Bartelme (2018)).
P
16
Without loss of generality, we can decompose x0F j,s τ̂F j,s into a sector mean, ζ̂s ≡ N −1 j (x0F j,s τ̂F j,s ), and a
sector-market residual, ε̂j,s ≡ x0F j,s τ̂F j,s − ζ̂s .

12

In this case, η̂iR is a shift-share variable based on sectoral employment shares. It is thus the
regional exposure to import competition used in a growing empirical literature. If F becomes more
productive (ζ̂s < 0 for all s), then every other market suffers a negative revenue shift, η̂iR < 0. The
0
effect is stronger in markets with a higher employment share in sectors (i.e., higher yi,s
) with a
stronger foreign shock (i.e., lower ζ̂s ). Our theory also entails a consumption cost shift that is
proportional to a shift-share variable based, instead, on sectoral spending shares. If ζ̂s < 0, then
consumption cost falls everywhere, η̂iC < 0. The decline is stronger in markets with higher spending
shares in sectors (i.e., higher ξi,s ) with a stronger foreign shock (i.e., lower ζ̂s ).
The partial equilibrium excess demand shift can be now written in terms of the shifts in revenue
and consumption cost.

where ᾱ ≡ Ī − ȳ 0 + χ̄0 ψ̄ Ī + φ̄ x̄00 ψ̄ , ȳ 0 is the revenue share matrix with entries yij0 , and
x̄00 is the spending share matrix with entries x0ij .
Proof. See Appendix 8.3.
The first component in (14), the revenue shift η̂ R , measures the shock’s impact on the demand
for goods from each market (holding wages and employment constant). The second component
measures the labor supply shift caused by the import price shock. It arises only when labor supply
p
is a function of consumption prices (φ̄ 6= 0). The total effect on the excess labor demand is
amplified by the multiplier matrix ᾱ implied by the feedback effect of employment on productivity
and market size (holding wages constant).
We convey the intuition for the supply shift in the special case without cross-market links in

Consider the supply shift implied by an increase in foreign productivity that lowers consumption
cost everywhere, η̂iC < 0. The shock causes a labor supply increase in i, pushing down excess
labor demand by φp η̂iC . However, labor supply increases in every other market j, increasing i’s
P
excess demand proportionally to its revenue share from j, −φp j yij0 η̂jC . The net effect is the first
term in (15). Second, through the productivity response, the higher labor supply in i lowers its
good prices by ψφp η̂iC . The second term in (15) is this cost reduction times the demand elasticity
13

χ̄0 . The third term in (15) arises from the several feedback rounds of changes in labor supply
and productivity. Because all entries of φp ψ x̄00 are positive, every term in the series expansion is
positive and, therefore, amplifies the effect of the net labor supply and productivity terms.
Remark 2. The revenue shift η̂ R has a direct impact on excess labor demand η̂. The impact of the
p
consumption cost shift η̂ C is proportional to the price elasticity of labor supply φ̄ .

3.2

Direct and Indirect Effects in General Equilibrium

We now investigate the general equilibrium impact of partial equilibrium shifts in excess labor
demand. We start by establishing that the spatial links matrix is a function of the spatial
connections in labor supply, productivity, and trade demand.
Proposition 3. The spatial links matrix is

Supply substitution

Proof. See Appendix 8.4.
The spatial links matrix combines two forces created by spatial connections. The first is the
demand substitution effect implied by changes in trade demand, as summarized in (ȳ 0 , χ̄0 ). It
controls how much the wage change in one market affects demand for goods elsewhere (given initial
employment). The second is the supply substitution effect that regulates how much excess labor
demand changes due to employment responses. It is the sum of the wage’s direct impact on labor
w
p
supply, φ̄ , and its indirect impact on labor supply through changes in the price index, φ̄ x̄00 .17
Again, the labor supply response is amplified by the multiplier matrix ᾱ defined in Theorem 1.
We now characterize the general equilibrium response of relative wages.
Theorem 2. Suppose that Assumption 1 holds. Consider shocks to bilateral shifters, τ̂ , with an
associated vector of excess demand shifts given by η̂. Then,

Proof. See Appendix 8.5.
Theorem 2 characterizes the reduced-form impact of shifts in excess labor demand on relative
wages (given the normalization ŵm ≡ 1). The term βij is the reduced-form elasticity of market
i’s relative wage to market j’s partial equilibrium excess demand shift. Equation (17) shows that
local shock exposure percolates to other markets: η̂j has a direct effect of βjj η̂j on the own market
j and an indirect effect of βij η̂j on other markets i. Thus, i’s relative wage responses aggregates
the direct exposure to its own shock (η̂i ) and the indirect exposure to the shock of other markets
(η̂j for j 6= i), where the aggregation weights are given by βij . Accordingly, conditional on knowing
the excess demand shifts η̂, the matrix of reduced-form elasticities β̄ is sufficient to aggregate wage
responses in general equilibrium. Thus, expression (17) can be used to construct an ex-ante analog
of the type of sufficient statistic for welfare gains in Arkolakis et al. (2012) that only requires
outcomes in the initial equilibrium.18
The theorem shows that βij is a series expansion of the spatial links matrix γ̄. A stronger
bilateral link γij yields a larger indirect effect βij : the first term of βij in (18) is proportional to γij .
The change in i’s excess demand must also be corrected for changes in the wages of other markets,
triggering higher-round responses captured by the power series in (18), whose magnitude depends
on the combined strength of the connections across the network of markets.19
This result indicates that the spatial links matrix γ̄ determines the reduced-form elasticity
matrix β̄. In fact, Appendix 8.6 shows that the connection between γ̄ and β̄ holds also in the
opposite direction since β̄ is, up to a normalization, the inverse of γ̄.
Remark 3. Given the vector of partial equilibrium shifts η̂, the general equilibrium wage responses
aggregate the direct effect of the own market shock exposure, βii η̂i , and the indirect effects of other
P
markets’ exposure, j6=i βij η̂j . The indirect effects βij are stronger among markets with stronger

3.3

Understanding Indirect Effects in General Equilibrium

We now present two special cases to provide further intuition for the results above. They illustrate
how indirect effects shape the general equilibrium impact of trade shocks on local labor markets.
They also link the reduced-form representation in (17) to specifications used to investigate how
regional markets respond to trade shocks in a recent empirical literature.
18

Our characterization also complements the connection between outcomes and market access across regions
introduced by Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016). While the aggregation of the reduced-form responses based on (17)
immediately yields wage changes in general equilibrium, the aggregation of the impact of market access also involves
an endogenous shifter implied by the full specification of the model.
19
Similar power series of indirect effects arise in the percolation of shocks across the network of sectors e.g.,
Acemoglu et al. (2012) and Acemoglu et al. (2016).

15

Our first special case provides a sufficient condition for the direct and indirect effects to have
the same sign. It imposes that γ̄ satisfies the gross substitution property, which effectively restricts
demand substitution in γ̄ to dominate opposing supply substitution forces.
Corollary 1. If γ̄ satisfies gross-substitution (γij < 0 for i 6= j), then βij > 0 for all (i, j).
Proof. See Appendix 8.7.
To understand this result, consider again the productivity increase in foreign market F . If the
negative revenue shift of i dominates the impact of its consumption cost shift (η̂i < 0), then market
i’s excess demand shift leads to reinforcing indirect effects everywhere, lowering not only i’s wage
relative to F , but also that of all other markets. Intuitively, a negative revenue shift in a market
reduces the demand for goods produced in other markets, further decreasing revenues and wages
in those markets. In this case, ignoring indirect effects underestimates the impact of the foreign
productivity shock on local outcomes.
The second special case restricts spatial links to be identical.
Corollary 2. If the entries of γ̄ satisfy γij = γI[i=j] − γj , then βij = βI[i=j] + βj ∀ (i, j).
Proof. See Appendix 8.8.
This case gives rise to an ‘‘endogenous’’ fixed-effect, which contains the sum of the indirect
P
effects of all markets, j βj η̂j . This common component can be ignored only if the shock affects a
zero mass of markets. Notice that βj is positive whenever γ̄ also satisfies gross substitution (i.e.,
γj > 0). In this case, a foreign productivity gain leading to η̂i < 0 for all i 6= F creates a negative
fixed-effect that reinforces the wage decline caused by the market’s own shock exposure.
Remark 4. The off-diagonals of the spatial links matrix determine the sign and the heterogeneity
of the indirect effects of excess labor demand shifts in other markets.
Connection to gravity trade models. The previous two corollaries illustrate the predictions
w
p
of gravity trade models with exogenous labor supply (φ̄ = φ̄ = 0) – e.g., see Costinot and
Rodrı́guez-Clare (2014). In fact, these models satisfy the gross-substitution property if the trade
elasticity s is positive (Alvarez and Lucas, 2007). By Corollary 1, in this case, excess labor demand
shifts further propagate through the trade network, generating reinforcing indirect effects on other
markets. Theorem 2 indicates that these indirect effects are stronger in nearby markets for which
γij is likely to be higher.20
20

A gravity structure of bilateral trade is also present in quantitative spatial frameworks used in a recent
literature (e.g. Allen and Arkolakis (2014); Redding and Rossi-Hansberg (2017)). However, in these models, the
gross-substitution property may not hold due to the combination of endogenous responses in employment and
productivity across markets. This creates a force for attenuating indirect effects as negative shocks elsewhere lead
to local employment increases that have positive impacts on local market size and labor productivity.

16

This special case allows us to tightly connect our results to existing evidence on the response of
regional wages to trade shocks – e.g., Kovak (2013); Autor et al. (2013). To see this, assume no
trade costs (i.e., yij,s = xij,s = xi ), and consider again the shifts created by the sectoral component
of productivity gains in the foreign country F (i.e., ζ̂s > 0 for all i 6= F ). By Corollary 2, equation
(17) for any i 6= F becomes
ŵi = β η̂iR + η̄ R

where

η̄ R ≡

X
j

βj η̂jR

and

η̂iR ≡

X

0
yi,s
ζ̂s .

(19)

s

This expression implies that the differential wage response of market i is proportional to that
market’s shift-share exposure (as measured by η̂iR ). The elasticity β measures how much more
relative wages respond in markets experiencing stronger shifts in excess demand. The general
equilibrium response also includes the common ‘‘endogenous’’ fixed-effect η̄ R that incorporates the
indirect effects of labor demand shifts in other markets. This fixed-effect reinforces the impact of
the market’s own revenue shift caused by the foreign productivity gains (η̂iR < 0 for all i 6= F ). Its
size is proportional to the size of the more severely exposed markets (see Appendix 8.8).
Our model thus generalizes shift-share specifications used in this recent empirical literature. In
the general case considered in Theorem 2, the indirect effect of the shock exposure of other markets
may reinforce or attenuate the direct effect of the local shock exposure. These indirect effects are
stronger between markets with stronger spatial links. In Section 5, we use the heterogeneity in
indirect effects to propose a strategy to estimate how local labor markets respond to the shock
exposure of different markets. The strategy exploits the one-to-one mapping between β̄ and γ̄
to reduce the number of parameters in estimation. Before we do that, we derive our model’s
reduced-form expressions for changes in wages, employment, and real wages.

3.4

Extensions

In Online Appendix C, we derive versions of the results in this section for several extensions of
our baseline model. We highlight potential differences in terms of sources of spatial links, which
regulate the reduced-form general equilibrium elasticities, and the shock exposure measures, which
take the form of shift-share variables.
Trade imbalances. We follow Dekle et al. (2007) to incorporate exogenous trade imbalances for
each market (specified in terms of the world’s average wage). All results above remain valid with
a spatial links matrix that accounts for the effect of wage changes on transfers.
Bilateral migration. We follow Bryan and Morten (2015) to incorporate bilateral migration
flows into our model. All results above remain the same. The only difference is that this extended
model also yields predicted changes in bilateral migration flows following trade shocks.
Multiple worker groups. We introduce multiple worker groups, as in Cravino and Sotelo (2019).

17

In this case, the market definition includes worker groups and the spatial links matrix depends on
the elasticity of substitution in production across groups. We show that revenue shifts for each
group are based on the group’s employment distribution across sectors.
General trade demand. We relax the nested CES demand structure by considering an one-factor
economy with arbitrary within-sector heterogeneity in productivity across goods and markets, as
in Adao et al. (2017). The main difference in this case is that spatial links in trade demand χij
take a more general form and they also enter the definition of the revenue shift.
Input-Output linkages. We finally extend our model to incorporate input-output linkages in
production, as in Caliendo and Parro (2015). Bilateral trade demand for intermediate inputs
are reflected in the spatial links matrix. This economy entails an additional exposure measure
capturing shifts in the cost of imported inputs, which takes the form of a shift-share variable
based on shares of intermediate input usage across sectors for each market (similar to the ones in
Acemoglu et al. (2016)).

Reduced-Form Responses in General Equilibrium

In this section, we derive our theory’s reduced-form representation for the impact of trade shocks
on employment and wages across markets. In particular, we show how each labor market responds,
directly and indirectly, to the shock-induced shifts in revenue and consumption cost of different
markets. These reduced-form expressions are the cornerstone of our empirical strategy to measure
the labor market consequences of trade shocks in general equilibrium. Appendix 8.9 contains the
derivations for this section.

Wage changes combine (i) the vector of shock-induced shifts in revenue and consumption costs,
R
C
η̂ and η̂ C , and (ii) the reduced-form elasticity matrices of wage changes to these shifts, β̄ and β̄ .
The elasticity of wages to shifts in revenue and excess labor demand are identical, so it has all the
properties discussed in Sections 3.2 and 3.3. The reduced-form elasticity of wages to consumption
cost shifts also includes the supply component of the excess demand shift discussed in Section 3.1
p
and, as such, it is proportional to φ̄ .
Turning to employment, the labor supply function in (1) and the price index in (8) yield

where ρ̄ ≡ (Ī + φ̄ x̄00 ψ̄)−1 and φ̄ ≡ (φ̄ + φ̄ x̄00 ). This expression captures all the different
channels through which trade shocks affect employment in our model. ρ̄ is the multiplier of
employment-induced changes in productivity and prices that feedback into further employment
changes. It is the matrix that introduces the amplifying series expansion in ᾱ – see equation (15).
The terms inside brackets capture the labor supply responses to changes in wages and prices: φ̄ŵ
p
is the impact of wages through the elasticity structure of labor supply in φ̄, and φ̄ η̂ C is the impact
p
of import prices through the price elasticity of labor supply in φ̄ .
We use this expression to write employment changes as only a function of shifts in revenue and
consumption cost. The combination of (20) and (21) implies
L̂ = ϕ̄R η̂ R + ϕ̄C η̂ C

such that ϕ̄R ≡ ρ̄φ̄β̄

R

 p
and ϕ̄C ≡ ρ̄ Ī − φ̄β̄ ᾱ φ̄ .

(22)

Employment responses depend again on η̂ R and η̂ C , but they are now multiplied by different
reduced-form elasticity matrices, ϕ̄R and ϕ̄C . The revenue elasticity combines the revenue shift’s
impact on wages β̄ and the employment elasticity to wages ρ̄φ̄. The consumption cost elasticity
p
is the sum of employment responses to the consumption cost shift, ρ̄φ̄ , and the wage change
C
p
induced by the cost shift, ρ̄φ̄β̄ . Thus, ϕ̄C is proportional to φ̄ .
Through the lens of our model, (20) and (22) are the reduced-form responses of local labor
market outcomes to trade shocks in general equilibrium. Accordingly, they allow us to aggregate any
vector of partial equilibrium shifts η̂ R and η̂ C to obtain wage and employment responses in general
R
C
equilibrium. This aggregation only requires the reduced-form elasticity matrices (β̄ , β̄ , ϕ̄R , ϕ̄C ).
Remark 5. The reduced-form expressions in (20) and (22) connect responses of wage and employment to shock-induced vectors of shifts in revenue and consumption cost. The reduced-form
elasticities are sufficient to aggregate any vector of shifts η̂ R and η̂ C to obtain wage and employment
responses in general equilibrium.

4.2

Real Wage Responses

We conclude our theoretical analysis by establishing how trade shocks affect real wages, defined
as Ŵi = ŵi − P̂i . We use the real wage change as measure of the shock’s impact on welfare. In
fact, Online Appendix B.3 shows that, under general preferences for consumption and leisure, the
equivalent welfare variation in each market implied by the shock is increasing in the shock’s impact

19

on the market’s real wage. The real wage changes can be decomposed into three terms:
Ŵ =

Terms-of-trade gains

+

x̄00 ψ̄ L̂
| {z }

Efficiency gains

−

η̂ C

.

(23)

Consumption cost gains

The terms in this expression represent the three main sources of welfare gains in the model: (i)
changes in terms-of-trade due to the wage changes characterized in (20), (ii) changes in labor
productivity due to the employment changes characterized in (22), and (iii) the partial equilibrium
changes in consumption cost, η̂ C in (12).
The main forces shaping real wage responses can be readily seen using again the example of the
w
p
gravity trade model and a foreign productivity shock. In such case, φ̄ = φ̄ = 0 and, therefore,

Ŵ = Ī − x̄00 β̄ η̂ R − η̂ C
where β̄ > 0. For a foreign productivity gain, ηiR < 0 and ηiC < 0 for all i 6= C. This creates two
opposite forces on the real wage: it tends to fall because of adverse terms of trade movements, but
it tends to rise due to lower import prices. The overall effect depends on the relative intensity of
these forces as controlled by the reduced-form elasticity β̄.

Measurement of General Equilibrium Effects in Space

We now develop a methodology to estimate the general equilibrium reduced-form elasticities. We
specify the data generating process using our theory’s reduced-form representation for changes in
wages and employment across markets. We then outline parametric restrictions on spatial links
that make the reduced-form elasticity matrix a function of observable variables and unknown
parameters. We finally characterize a GMM estimator of the vector of parameters based on the
Optimal IV approach of Chamberlain (1987).

5.1

Data Generating Process
t

We observe changes in employment and wages between t and t0 , L̂ and ŵt , as well as the sectort0
level trade matrix at t0 , {Xij,s
}. We decompose trade cost changes into observed and unobserved
t
t
components such that τ̂ = τ̂ O + τ̂ tU .21 Since ηiR (τ̂ t ) and ηiC (τ̂ t ) in (12) are linear combinations of
τ̂ , we can define the shifts implied by each component of the shock:
η̂ R (τ̂ t ) = η̂ R (τ̂ tO ) + η̂ R (τ̂ tU ) and η̂ C (τ̂ t ) = η̂ C (τ̂ tO ) + η̂ C (τ̂ tU ).
21

(24)

The observed component may be sectoral productivity shocks in a foreign country or changes in import barriers
in an importer country. The unobserved component includes all other sources of trade shocks.

Without loss of generality, we define the time fixed-effects, β t and ϕt , to be the mean effect
on wage and employment of the unobserved trade shocks, η̂ R (τ̂ tU ) and η̂ C (τ̂ tU ). The terms νiw,t
and νiL,t are then the deviations from the mean for market i in wage and employment responses
to η̂ R (τ̂ tU ) and η̂ C (τ̂ tU ). Notice that we can easily allow νiw,t and νiL,t to also include the effect of
labor supply shocks – i.e., the reduced-form responses to the shifts in Li = Φi ({vjw wj }j , {vjp Pj }j ).
Assumption 5a. [DGP] Between periods t0 and t, we observe a trade shock vector τ̂ tO . We
also observe changes in wages and employment, ŵit and L̂ti , that are given by equation (25) with
νiw,t and νiL,t denoting mean-zero unobserved residuals.

5.2

Dimensionality Reduction: Parametrizing Spatial Links

The estimation of equation (25) entails one important challenge: while we only observe employment
and wage changes for N markets, (25) has 4N 2 unknown elasticities. To circumvent this problem,
we parametrize spatial links to write reduced-form elasticities as non-linear functions of observable
variables in the initial equilibrium and a small number of unknown parameters.22 Our parametric
assumptions yield a parsimonious specification while incorporating enough degrees of freedom to
flexibly capture different response patterns in the data.
Definition of a Market. Each market i is an integrated regional labor market, in which workers
are perfectly mobile across sectors. In the empirical analysis below, markets are U.S. Commuting
Zones (CZs), as in Tolbert and Sizer (1996).
Labor Supply. The labor supply elasticities to changes in wages and prices are given by
w
m 0
w
p w
φw
ij = φ I[i=j] − φ mij − (φ + φ )bj ,

and φpij = φp I[i=j] + φm m0ij − (φw + φp )bpj ,

p
where m0ij is the observed share of i’s population born in j at t0 , and bw
j and bj are observed
P

j + bj ) = 1.
The parameters φw and φp control, respectively, the sensitivity of regional employment to
the local wage and price index. As discussed in Section 4, φw is proportional to the response of
22

This procedure effectively projects the reduced-form elasticities in (25) onto observable variables regulating the
strength of spatial links. It is similar to the common practice in demand estimation of specifying cross-price demand
elasticities in terms of observable variables (Berry, 1994; Berry et al., 1995).

21

regional employment to the shock-induced change in the region’s wage. It captures the evidence in
Autor et al. (2013) and Dix-Carneiro and Kovak (2017) that both employment and wage growth
are lower in regions more exposed to import competition shocks. In contrast, φp is proportional
to i’s employment response to its own import price shock η̂iC . This allows the model to flexibly
match the type of employment responses to lower import prices studied by Acemoglu et al. (2016)
and Pierce and Schott (2016). The parameter φm controls the employment response in i to wage
changes in the regions where a higher share of i’s population was born (i.e., m0ij is higher). It thus
captures the gravity migration links documented by Bryan and Morten (2015). For simplicity, we
impose identical absolute values for the cross-market labor supply elasticities associated with mij
for changes in prices and wages.
p
Lastly, bw
j and bj in (26) guarantee the homogeneity of the labor supply function, so that
employment changes are invariant to the numeraire choice. Our baseline specification uses bpj = 0
P
and bw
j = Yj /
o Yo , which can be interpreted as setting non-employment benefits in terms of the
world’s average wage (the same numeraire used for international transfers).23
Productivity. The labor productivity elasticity to changes in employment is
ψij = ψI[i=j] .

(27)

The parameter ψ is the elasticity of regional labor productivity to regional employment. As
discussed in Section 3, when combined with the labor supply elasticity in (26), a higher value of ψ
amplifies the reduced-form elasticities of wages and employment to the observed shifts in revenue
and consumption. Intuitively, it regulates the strength of the feedback effect of employment on
productivity and, therefore, excess labor demand. It captures the agglomeration forces documented
by Greenstone et al. (2010), Kline and Moretti (2014) and Peters (2019). It is important to note
that such channel is absent in recent quantitative spatial frameworks based on the Ricardian model
of Eaton and Kortum (2002) – e.g. Caliendo et al. (2018), Caliendo et al. (2019) and Galle et al.
(2017).

We summarize these parametric restrictions in the following assumption.
Assumption 5b. [Parametrization of spatial links] Assume that (26)–(28) hold. Conditional on θ ≡ (φw , φp , φm , ψ, ), equation (29) relates observed changes in wage and employment to
the observed shifts in revenue and consumption cost in (30) across markets.

Assumption 5c. [Exogeneity] Let νi ≡ νi , νi
. In every period t, E νit | η̂ R,t , η̂ C,t = 0.
Assumption 5c imposes that the unobserved residuals in (29) are mean-independent from the
observed shifts in revenue and consumption. This type of exogeneity condition is necessary for the
causal interpretation of estimates of how regional labor markets respond to international trade
shocks – e.g. Topalova (2010), Kovak (2013), Autor et al. (2013).24

Consider a function Hi η̂ R,t , η̂ C,t with dimension dim(θ) × 2. By the law of iterated expectations, Assumption 5c implies
E[Hi (η̂ R,t , η̂ C,t )νit ] = 0,
(31)
which yields the following class of GMM estimators of θ.

Definition 1. Let Hi η̂ R,t , η̂ C,t be a dim(θ) × 2 function and νit (θ) be the residual implied by
(29) under Assumptions 5a and 5b. Define the GMM estimator:
Since τ̂ tU generates the structural residuals νiw,t and νiL,t , Assumption 5c is implied by the independence between
and τ̂ tO (given the initial trade matrix). This is similar to the requirements for identification and consistency in
shift-share designs (see Borusyak et al. (2018) and Adão et al. (2019)).

The estimator in (32) is consistent for θ whenever Hi (·) satisfies the usual rank conditions
establishing identification in GMM estimators.25 Notice that a necessary condition for identification
is that all elements of θ are associated with heterogeneous responses to the shock exposure across
markets (instead of an identical effect on all markets). In fact, the results in Section 3 show that
bilateral reduced-form elasticities are increasing in bilateral spatial links, implying that identification
relies on heterogeneity in the bilateral variables governing the spatial links associated with θ.
The implementation of the GMM estimator in (32) requires specifying Hi (·). Although any
function yields a consistent estimator of θ, functions vary in terms of asymptotic variance – that
is, the estimators differ in precision.26 The following proposition uses the approach in Chamberlain
(1987) to characterize the function Hi∗ (·) that minimizes the asymptotic variance of θ̂ H .
Proposition 4. Under Assumptions 5a–5c, the function that minimizes the asymptotic variance
of the class of estimators in Definition 1 is


The optimal function Hi∗ η̂ R,t , η̂ C,t has two components. The matrix Ωti attributes larger
weight to observations with a lower variance of unobserved residuals – under homoskedasticity,
Ωti = Ωt is the GMM optimal moment weight matrix. The second component is the predicted
response of the endogenous variables associated with θ. Intuitively, through the Jacobian matrix
in (34), the Optimal IV of each parameter in θ puts more weight on the observed shifts of markets
whose reduced-form effects on market i are more sensitive to changes in that parameter.
The Optimal IV in Proposition 4 is a function of the unknown vector θ. To simplify its implementation, we characterize an asymptotically equivalent two-step estimator: the Model-implied Optimal
25

See Theorems 2.6 and 2.7 in Newey and McFadden (1994).
Newey and McFadden (1994) provide regularity conditions for normality of GMM estimators of the form in
(32) – see Theorem 3.4. This relies on the central limit theorem and, therefore, requires some sort of independence
assumption. We assume that residuals are i.i.d across markets or clusters of markets. Notice that the number of
moments is equal to the number of unknown parameters in θ. This does not imply any loss of generality, since it is
always possible to define Hi (· ) to include the optimal moment weighting matrix.

and obtain θ̂ from (32). Since the instrument is a function of (η̂ R,t , η̂ C,t ), the first-step estimator is
consistent but not optimal. Thus, in the second-step, we use the consistent estimator θ̂ to compute
a consistent estimator of the Optimal IV, Ĥi∗ = E[∇θ νit (θ̂)||η̂ R,t , η̂ C,t ](Ω̂ti )−1 . We then use it to
M OIV
obtain θ̂
from (32).
Proposition 5. The efficient estimator Hi∗ (η̂ R,t , η̂ C,t ) in (33)–(34) is asymptotically equivalent to
the Model-implied Optimal IV (MOIV) estimator obtained with the following two-step procedure.
Step 1. Using a guess θ 0 , estimate θ̂ from (32) using Hi0 = E[∇θ νit (θ 0 )|η̂ R,t , η̂ C,t ](Ω̂ti )−1 .

Application: Measuring the Effects of The China Shock

In the last part of the paper, we use the results above to study how the rise in Chinese manufacturing
exports affected U.S. CZs. We follow Autor et al. (2013) (henceforth ADH) to specify the observed
sectoral intensity of the ‘‘China Shock.’’ We first show that the methodology of Section 5 yields a
generalization of the empirical specification in ADH. We then estimate our theory’s reduced-form
representation for employment and wage responses to the shock and use it to compute the shock’s
general equilibrium impact on U.S. CZs.

6.1

A General Equilibrium Extension of ADH

We start by connecting our theory’s estimating equation (29) to the main specification in ADH.
We focus on the labor market consequences of the sector-level average of the Chinese cost shock,

P
ζ̂st ≡ N −1 j x0China,j,s τ̂China,j,s . We project ζ̂st onto ADH’s sector-level shift: the per-worker
Chinese exports growth to developed countries (excluding the U.S.), ∆Mso,t .
Assumption 6a. [ADH Shock] Assume that
ζ̂st = κ∆Mso,t + ε̂ts

such that ∆Mso,t ⊥ ε̂tk ∀s, k.

(35)

In equation (35), κ is the pass-through coefficient that connects the increase in per-worker
Chinese exports ∆Mso,t to changes in Chinese production costs ζ̂st . This parameter is negative because
a sector with stronger cost reduction should have stronger export growth. Under Assumption
6a, equation (30) implies that η̂iR,t and η̂iC,t are proportional to shift-share variables based on

25

The revenue shift is a linear function of the shift-share instrumental variable used in ADH – see
equation (3) in ADH. In addition, the consumption cost shift yields a new shift-share measure, IP Cit ,
where the shift ∆Mso,t is interacted with the CZ’s spending share on sector s. Under Assumption
6a, ε̂R,t
and ε̂C,t
are orthogonal to IP Wit and IP Cit . From (29) and (36),

Equation (37) is a strict generalization of ADH’s main specification. In fact, ADH only allow
for a common direct effect of the CZ’s own revenue shift and the endogenous fixed-effect of revenue
C
C
shifts: βijR (θ) = βI[i=j] + βj , ϕR
ij (θ) = ϕI[i=j] + ϕj , and βij (θ) = ϕij (θ) = 0. As discussed in Section
3.3, such a specification arises under two restrictions. First, consumption cost shifts can only be
ignored when labor supply does not respond to prices (i.e., φp = φm = 0). Second, common indirect
effects only arise when we restrict further the spatial links matrix to have identical off-diagonal
elements in all rows – as in the case of equal spending shares (xij = yji = xi for all j). Notice that,
even in this special case, the specification in ADH cannot separately identify the common indirect
effect from other national shocks included in the time fixed-effect. Hence, whenever this common
indirect effect is not zero, it delivers only part of the general equilibrium impact of the China shock
on U.S. CZs.
In general, our theory implies that we must estimate how employment and wages in CZ i
respond to both the IP Wjt and IP Cjt of the own CZ as well as those of other CZs. As discussed in
Section 3.2, these reduced-form elasticities vary across markets because of the bilateral spatial links
that we parametrize in terms of sector specialization, trade flows, and migration flows. Even in the
presence of time fixed-effects, we identify each element of θ from the response of outcomes in a CZ
to the shock exposure of the CZs with higher values of the bilateral variables associated with each
parameter. Thus, in the rest of this section, we rely on equation (37) to estimate the reduced-form
−1 C
−1 C
elasticity matrices, {βijR (θ), ϕR
ij (θ), βij (θ), ϕij (θ)}ij , using the MOIV estimator described in
Section 5.3. To adjust for the scale of the shock, we separately estimate the pass-through parameter
κ using the linear expression in (35).

Notes: For each CZ, the left panel reports IP Wit and the right panel reports IP Cit . IP Wit has standard deviation of 2.52, IP Cit has
standard deviation of 1.22. The spatial correlation between IP Wit and IP Cit is 0.34.

6.2

Data Construction

We now provide an overview of the steps to construct the data used in estimation. Appendix 9
presents a detailed discussion of the data construction methodology.
We follow ADH by considering the 722 CZs in mainland U.S. over 1990-2000 and 2000-2007.
We use the procedure in the Online Appendix of ADH to construct the number of employed
individuals and the average weekly log-wage in each CZ using the Census Integrated Public Use
Micro Samples in 1990 and 2000 and the American Community Survey in 2006-2008. We also use
the U.S. Census data in 2000 to measure mij as the share of working-age individuals in CZ i that
report to be living in CZ j 5 years ago.
We construct the shift-share variables IP Wit and IP Cit as follows. We compute IP Wit by
interacting ADH’s sector-level shift ∆Mso,t and the CZ’s ten-year-lagged employment share in
that sector. For each CZ, we use the imputation methodology in ADH to obtain employment
by 4-digit SIC industry from the County Business Patterns. Thus, our IP W t is identical to the
instrumental variable in ADH. To construct IP Cit , we interact ADH’s sector-level shift ∆Mso,t
and the CZ’s sectoral spending share. We follow Gervais and Jensen (2019) to construct CZ-level
spending shares by 4-digit SIC industries using the national input-output table. Specifically, for
each industry, we combine the final consumption share from the national input-output table with
the CZ’s predicted input purchase share obtained by interacting national industry spending shares
and regional industry employment.27 Figure 1 reports the spatial variation in IP Wit and IP Cit . The
two measures have a good degree of variation across space, and their spatial correlation is 0.34.
To implement our strategy, we also construct sectoral trade matrices between the 722 U.S. CZs
and 52 foreign countries in 1990 and 2000. We assume a single labor market in each foreign country.
First, we use trade data from UN Comtrade to construct a country-to-country matrix of trade flows
27

In Appendix 9.3, we evaluate our procedure to construct CZ-level spending shares across 4-digit SIC industries.
We run a regression of state-STCG shipment inflows in the Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) on the state-SCTG
spending shares implied by the aggregation of our dataset, where SCTG is the commodity classification used in the
CFS. We obtain a coefficient close to 1 and a R2 of 0.95.

27

in 368 industries. We use the gravity structure of our model and data on domestic sales from Eora
MRIO to impute domestic spending shares in each industry. Second, we distribute U.S. domestic
and international trade flows across CZs using again the gravity structure of our model. We first
split U.S. Census data on imports and exports for each industry-country across CZs using each
CZ’s share in that industry’s national spending and production. We then impute bilateral trade
shares across CZs using an industry-level gravity specification estimated with bilateral shipment
data from the Commodity Flow Survey (CFS). Since our baseline model imposes trade balance, we
adjust market sizes to balance trade flows given the bilateral trade shares.28

6.3

Simple Extension of ADH

We begin our analysis with a simpler extension of the specification in ADH. Our goal is to provide
qualitative evidence for our main novel channels: how regional outcomes respond (i) directly to
the CZ’s own consumption shift, and (ii) indirectly to the revenue and consumption shifts of other
CZs. To this end, we consider an intuitive approximation of the reduced-form elasticity matrices
in equation (37):
Ŷit = αt + αR IP Wit + αC IP Cit + αIR

X
j6=i

zij IP Wjt + αIC

X

zij IP Cjt + Xit λ + νit

(38)

j6=i

where, for CZ i in period t, Ŷit is the change in log-employment or average weekly log-wage, αt is a
time fixed-effect, and Xit is a set of regional controls.29 We equally weight all CZs when estimating
(38) because our theory’s unit of observation is a market.
As in ADH, αR is the direct impact of higher exposure to Chinese import competition. We
also include αC to measure the direct effect of the CZ’s own consumption cost shift, as well as αIR
and αIC to measure the indirect effects of the revenue and consumption shifts of other CZs. We
use zij to parametrize cross-regional variation in these indirect effects. Since general equilibrium
reduced-form elasticities are stronger between CZs with stronger spatial links, we build on our
L0 D−δ
model’s gravity structure to set zij ≡ P jL0ijD−δ , where Dij is the bilateral distance between i and j,
k k ik
so that CZ i responds more to shocks in nearby and larger CZs. We set the parameter δ controlling
the relative importance of distance to five, following typical estimates of the trade elasticity.30
28

Table 11 in Appendix 9.3 reports validation tests using the CFS data for 1997, 2002 and 2007. Regressions of
actual on predicted trade flows across states and SCTGs yield coefficients close to 1 and R2 around 0.5.
29
We include the largest set of regional controls in ADH – i.e., column (6) of Table 3 in ADH. We also
include controls for the CZ’s exposure to the secular manufacturing decline in the period: the CZ’s spending and
0
0
employment shares in manufacturing (yi,M
and ξi,M
), as well as the weighted average of these shares across other
P
P
0
0
CZs, j6=i zij yj,M and j6=i zij ξj,M . Finally, we follow Greenland et al. (2019) by including the CZ’s lagged
population growth to absorb the effect of persistent confounding shocks.
30
Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016) rely on a similar specification to compute a proxy for their market access
measure in partial equilibrium. Online Appendix A shows that we obtain similar qualitative results for different
values for δ and functional forms for zij .

Table 1 reports the estimation of (38). Column (1) qualitatively replicates the main findings in
ADH. Regions initially specialized in industries subject to stronger Chinese import competition
exhibit slower growth in employment and wages. In contrast, column (2) shows that the shockinduced shift in consumption cost does not have a significant impact on both employment and
wage growth across CZs. Notice that this is driven by lower point estimates with relatively tight
confidence intervals – especially for the wage response in Panel A.31
31

Notice that input-output connections can be incorporated in the reduced-form of our model as an additional
shift-share variable, as discussed in Section 3.4. Since ξi,s includes sectoral intermediate input spending in the CZ,
our results indicate no systematic difference in the outcomes of CZs that intensively source inputs from industries
with larger increases in Chinese export growth. This result is consistent with those in Pierce and Schott (2016) and

29

Columns (3) and (4) investigate the indirect effect of the shock exposure of other CZs. Given
the CZ’s own revenue exposure, column (3) indicates that employment and wage growth are weaker
if nearby and larger CZs are more exposed to Chinese import competition. Compared to column
(1), the point estimates for the direct effect are one-fourth lower in column (3), suggesting that
the CZ’s own revenue shift is partially correlated with the revenue shifts of closer and larger CZs.
Column (4) shows however that the indirect effect of consumption exposure is not significant for
both wages and employment – again, confidence intervals have the same magnitude as those of
the indirect effect of revenue exposure. Finally, columns (5) and (6) indicates that results are
qualitatively similar when we use the specification with all measures of shock exposure.
Our estimates show that revenue shifts percolate through the spatial link’s network, amplifying
the negative direct impact of the CZ’s own exposure to Chinese import competition. The point
estimates in column (5) indicate that an increase of $1000 dollars in Chinese imports per U.S.
worker in all nearby CZs is associated with a weaker growth of 1.3 log-points in employment and
1.0 log-points in wages. These negative indirect effects are three times larger than the differential
direct impact of increasing the CZ’s own import competition exposure by $1000.
We can interpret these estimates using the theoretical insights presented in Section 3. First,
the negative direct impact of exposure to the China shock on employment and wages suggests
that revenue shifts have strong impacts on both employment and wages (i.e., φw is large). Second,
the negative indirect effect of revenue shifts indicates that demand substitution dominates supply
substitution in the spatial links matrix, as in Corollary 1. Lastly, the weak impact of consumption
cost shifts on employment and wages suggests that labor supply does not respond much to import
prices (i.e, φp is low relative to φw ).
Robustness. Online Appendix A.1.1 investigates the robustness of the results in Table 1. We
focus on our preferred specification in column (5). We first analyze the importance of the baseline
controls. While the wage responses are not sensitive to the control set, the estimated employment
responses are larger and more precise when we control for the lagged population growth, as in
Greenland et al. (2019).32 In addition, results are qualitatively similar when we compute zij (i)
with other distance parameters δ ∈ (1, 8), (ii) without CZ size, and (iii) only with CZs in the same
state. The indirect effects are negative and statistically significant when we weight CZs by their
1990 population (as in ADH), use the inference procedure in Adão et al. (2019), and use other
measures of the CZ’s spending shares ξi,s .
Acemoglu et al. (2016) that find no evidence of differential employment growth in industries using more intensively
inputs from sectors in which the China shock was stronger.
32
This is consistent with the results in ADH who find a significant negative effect of Chinese import exposure
only on manufacturing employment. In their baseline specification, the response of total employment is negative
but non significant at usual levels (see also Bloom et al. (2019)).

30

Additional results. Online Appendix A.1.2 complements our baseline estimates. We find
that the indirect effect is negative and statistically significant for employment responses in both
manufacturing and non-manufacturing. In contrast, similar to ADH, wage responses are mainly
driven by the non-manufacturing sector. Finally, we document that results are qualitatively similar
when the sector-level shifter is the NTR gap used by Pierce and Schott (2016).

6.4

Reduced-Form Elasticities to Revenue and Consumption Shifts

We now turn to the implementation of the empirical strategy described in Section 5. In comparison
to the simple linear specification presented above, this strategy imposes that general equilibrium
reduced-form elasticities are implied by a parametrization of the spatial links matrix. This has
two main advantages. It guarantees that the reduced-form elasticities capture both bilateral and
third-market connections among CZs that arise in general equilibrium (as parametrized by the
observable variables in our specification). In addition, it implies that, through the lens of our
spatial model, neither time fixed-effects nor residuals include any component of the endogenous
responses of regional outcomes to the observed sectoral average of the China shock. For these
reasons, the predicted reduced-form responses implied by our elasticity estimates can be used to
properly aggregate regional shock exposures when computing the general equilibrium impact of the
China shock on U.S. CZs.
We present our results in three steps. We first estimate the pass-through coefficient κ in
equation (35). We then estimate equation (37) and present the implied reduced-form elasticities.
Lastly, we evaluate the fit of our model by comparing its predicted responses to the China shock
to actual changes in employment and wages across CZs.
6.4.1

Pass-through of Chinese Export Growth to Chinese Cost Shock

We start by estimating the pass-through coefficient κ in equation (35). Since the reduced-form
elasticities in (37) are a non-linear function of θ, κ is necessary to adjust the scale of the sectoral
import changes in ADH to be consistent with the sectoral cost shocks in our theory. Thus, the
estimation of (35) can be seen as the first-stage in the estimation of θ.
We measure ζ̂st in two steps. We first estimate destination-sector-period fixed-effects, ρtj,s , in
a gravity equation of changes in bilateral trade shares across countries. Using the gravity trade

Table 2 presents the estimation of (35). It indicates that industries with stronger growth of
per-worker Chinese exports experienced stronger decline in Chinese production costs (as measured
by ζ̂st ). Specifically, a sector with $1000 higher per-worker Chinese export growth had a decline
in Chinese production cost of 0.38 percentage points in 1990-2000 and 0.10 percentage points in
2000-2007. We then set κ to the average estimate over the two periods: κ = −0.0024.

6.4.2

Estimation of the Reduced-form Elasticity Matrices

We now turn to the estimation of the reduced-form elasticities in estimation of (37). Table 3 reports
our baseline estimates of θ obtained from the estimation of (37) with the two-step procedure in
Proposition 5. We consider the same set of baseline controls in Table 1.
In Panel A, we present the estimation results without migration links in labor supply (i.e.,
φm = 0). We estimate an elasticity of labor productivity to local employment of 0.56. This is a
direct consequence of the large employment and wage responses to revenue shifts that we document
in Table 1. In order to rationalize such large reduced-form responses, the model requires strong
agglomeration forces that are higher than typical calibrations in the quantitative spatial literature
(we return to this point below). It is roughly twice the agglomeration elasticity implied by firm
entry in Krugman (1980) (as specified in Monte et al. (2018)) and much higher than the elasticity
of zero in Ricardian models such as Eaton and Kortum (2002) (as specified in Galle et al. (2017),
Caliendo et al. (2018) and Caliendo et al. (2019)). Instead, our estimate is closer to the elasticity
of manufacturing productivity to population density estimated from regional demand shocks in the
U.S. – for instance, Kline and Moretti (2014) estimate this elasticity to be around 0.4.
Second, we estimate a large elasticity of labor supply to wages, but a lower labor supply
elasticity to consumption prices. In fact, our estimate is closer to estimates based on the aggregate
employment responses to the business cycle, being three times higher than the median microestimate reviewed by Chetty et al. (2013). This high value is necessary to rationalize the strong
responses of employment to revenue shifts, both directly and indirectly. In contrast, we estimate

a lower labor supply elasticity to prices, φ̂p = −1.36. This parameter controls the response of
employment and wages to consumption cost shifts across CZs. Accordingly, the low φ̂p relative to
φ̂w follows from the weak responses of wages and employment to IP Cjt in Table 1. Notice that, in
the full structural estimation, we obtain a small confidence interval for φp because estimation uses
all the channels through which this parameter affects reduced-form elasticities in the model.34
Third, we find that gravity trade links across regions are important, implying a trade elasticity
of roughly four. This lies within the range of estimates in the literature – e.g., see Simonovska and
Waugh (2014) and Costinot and Rodrı́guez-Clare (2014). This parameter captures the negative
indirect effects of revenue shifts on both employment and wages that we document in Table 1.
Panel B presents results when we also estimate the parameter controlling migration links in
labor supply across markets. Our estimate of φm is not statistically different from zero at usual
significance levels. This implies that employment in a CZ, conditional on its own wage change,
does not respond much to revenue shifts in CZs with stronger migration links. This is consistent
with the evidence in ADH of weak responses in the CZ’s working-age population to its own revenue
shift.35 Notice that the point estimates of all other parameters are almost the same in Panels A
and B. However, relative to Panel A, standard errors are two to five times higher in Panel B. This
34

In Online Appendix B.1.2, we show that two rudimentary formulations of the intensive and extensive margins
of labor supply imply that employment is more sensitive to wages than to prices (i.e., φw > φp ). In a setting with a
representative household deciding the number of hours worked, this arises from the fact that a higher wage affects
labor supply only through changes in the opportunity cost of leisure (i.e., the real wage), whereas a lower price
index has ambiguous effects on labor supply because it increases both the real wage and the real value of lump-sum
transfers. In a setting with heterogeneous individuals in terms of disutility to work, the labor supply function
emerges from the comparison between the nominal wage and the home sector’s payoff in each region and, therefore,
it is not a direct function of the region’s price index.
35
Greenland et al. (2019) find that, in response to the China shock, population responses are weak for all
working-age individuals, but are much stronger among young individuals aged below 30 years old. Our results are
also consistent with the evidence in Cadena and Kovak (2016) who find weak migration responses of U.S. native
workers to regional labor demand shocks, especially for non-college graduates.

33

follows from the high correlation between bilateral migration and trade shares across CZs, which
makes it hard to separately estimate the different parameters in the model.36 Given these results,
our preferred specification uses the estimates in Panel A. In Appendix A.2.1, we investigate the
sensitivity of reduced-form responses to different values of φm .
We now turn to the estimates of the reduced-form elasticities implied by the parameters in
Table 3. Table 4 reports percentiles of the empirical elasticity distribution for 2000. The top panel
reports the direct effects and the bottom panel reports the indirect effects.
The direct and indirect effects of revenue shifts are positive. Thus, a negative demand shock
in a CZ triggers reductions in wages and employment in that CZ as well as in other CZs. Since
the labor supply elasticity to wages is around two, revenue shifts affect more employment than
wages. In addition, indirect effects are typically smaller than direct effects: while the median direct
wage elasticity is 0.67, the median indirect wage elasticity is 0.002 (for employment, the median
elasticities are 1.46 and 0.003, respectively). This reflects the fact that there are 721 CZs indirectly
affecting each CZ.
Moreover, our estimates indicate that both wages and employment respond less to consumption
cost shifts than to revenue shifts. The median direct elasticity to η̂iC is -0.35 for wages and -1.21
for employment. For indirect effects, the difference is even starker: the median elasticity to
consumption shifts is close to 0 for both wages and employment.
Importantly, the difference between the 90th and 10th percentiles of the estimated elasticities
suggests a large dispersion in direct and indirect effects across U.S. CZs. As discussed in Section 3,
this arises from the observed heterogeneity in the variables controlling bilateral spatial linkages.
Online Appendix A.2.2 shows that the indirect effects are increasing in the intuitive measure of
gravity links zij used in Table 1, but zij explains only a small fraction of the variation in indirect
effects. Instead, the elements of the spatial links matrix, yij and χij , explain roughly 50% of the
variation in indirect effects across pairs of CZs.
Robustness. Online Appendix A.2.1 investigates the robustness of the estimated reduced-form
elasticities to the assumptions in the baseline parametrization of spatial links in Section 5.2. In
particular, we re-estimate the specification in Panel A of Table 3 when we (i) allow for trade
imbalances, (ii) use a calibration of migration links from the literature, and (iii) impose labor
supply homogeneity in terms of the national price index (rather than the world’s average wage).
For all alternative specifications, despite the estimated parameters being different, the estimated
reduced-form elasticities are highly correlated with our baseline estimates.
36

It may be possible to improve on the estimation of spatial links in labor supply by extending our empirical
strategy to include one additional estimating equation for reduced-form responses in bilateral migration flows – as
in the extension presented in Online Appendix C.2.

Model Fit

Finally, we investigate how observed changes in employment and wages across CZs relate to our
baseline predicted responses to the China shock. As a benchmark, we compare this relationship to
that obtained with alternative specifications of spatial links motivated by the existing literature.
Specifically, we consider the following linear regression:
Ŷit = αt + ρŶit (IP W , IP C|θ) + Xit λ + νit

(39)

where, in CZ i in period t, Ŷit (IP W , IP C|θ) is the response to the China shock implied by our
model with parameter vector θ, and Xit is the same control set used in Table 1.
The coefficient ρ summarizes the relationship between actual and predicted changes in labor
market outcomes across CZs. A coefficient of one means that predicted reduced-form responses
have the correct magnitude to match cross-regional variation in wage and employment growth. In
contrast, an estimated coefficient much larger than one implies that reduced-form responses in the
model need to be multiplied by a large re-scaling coefficient ρ to match the observed variation in
wage and employment growth between CZs. In this case, the predicted responses in the model are
too small compared to the differential effect of higher shock exposure observed in the data. Finally,
a non-significant coefficient indicates that the model’s predicted responses are not correlated with
the observed changes in labor market outcomes.
Table 5 reports the estimates of (39) under alternative parameterizations of our model. The
coefficients close to one in column (1) indicate that our baseline estimates yield reduced-form
responses to the China shock that are aligned with observed changes in wages and employment for
U.S. CZs. This is a consequence of the fact that we estimate θ precisely from the effect of shock
exposure on employment and wages, as specified in equation (37). Column (2) reports similar fit

coefficients when we consider the alternative specification with migration links.37
Columns (3) and (4) show how the fit coefficients change when we calibrate agglomeration
forces to be weaker. In column (3), we set ψ = 0.2 as in the increasing returns framework of
Krugman (1980) and, more recently, Monte et al. (2018) and, in column (4), we set ψ = 0 as in
the Ricardian framework of Eaton and Kortum (2002) and, more recently, in Galle et al. (2017),
Caliendo et al. (2018) and Caliendo et al. (2019). The fit coefficient is substantially higher when ψ
is lower. As discussed in Section 3, higher values of ψ amplify the reduced-form responses in the
model. Thus, as we reduce ψ, a higher ρ is necessary to match the large differential responses to
shock exposure that we observed across U.S. CZs.
Columns (5) and (6) investigate how the specification of labor supply links affects the model
fit. In column (5), we set φw = −φp = 0.7, so that the CZ’s labor supply responds to changes
in the local real wage with an elasticity given by the median estimate reported by Chetty et al.
(2013). This parametrization is consistent with that in Caliendo et al. (2019) who specify the
non-employment benefit in terms of the local price index – see equation (60) in their Appendix
C5. In this case, the fit coefficient for employment growth is very imprecise, indicating that this
specification greatly reduces the model’s ability to match cross-regional variation in employment
responses to shock exposure. As discussed in Section 3, by setting φw = −φp , we increase the
relative magnitude of the positive employment response to cheaper Chinese imports (relative to
37

As a robustness check, Table A.10 in Online Appendix A.2.1 shows that our estimates of the fit coefficients are
similar when we consider the alternative specifications of spatial links described in Section 6.4.2.

the negative response to the decline in revenue). However, as Table 1 shows, the impact of higher
consumption exposure on regional outcomes is not statistically significant at usual level. Lastly,
column (6) sets the elasticity of migration links in labor supply to 0.25 – an elasticity similar to the
(annual) estimate of the migration elasticity in Caliendo et al. (2019). We can see that allowing for
a larger migration elasticity does not affect much the fit of the model.
Figure 2 graphically illustrates the results reported in Table 5 using bin scatter plots of actual
changes in labor market outcomes and predicted responses to the China shock across U.S. CZs.
In line with the estimates in column (1) of Table 5, the black circles show that our baseline
predicted responses are around the 45o degree line, indicating that they are not only correlated
with actual changes in employment and wages across CZs, but also their magnitude is consistent
with the differential regional responses in labor market outcomes. We also report the relationship
for the alternative specifications in columns (3) and (6) of Table 5. In both cases, the points are
concentrated around zero, indicating that the magnitude of these predicted responses is too small
compared to differential changes in labor market outcomes across U.S. CZs.38
38

Online Appendix A.2.2 investigates whether different specifications of spatial links can match the findings in
ADH: namely, the magnitude of the differential employment response to higher regional exposure to Chinese import
competition. Our baseline estimates yield differential responses that are similar to those in column (1) of Table 1.
In contrast, the alternative specifications in columns (3) and (6) of Table 5 yield much smaller differential responses
that are less than one-fourth of those reported in column (1) of Table 1.

6.5

The Impact of the China Shock in General Equilibrium

We conclude our analysis by quantifying the impact of the China shock on U.S. CZs. Based on
the theoretical results in Sections 3 and 4, we directly aggregate our estimates of equation (37) to
obtain responses of employment and wages in general equilibrium. We then use expression (23) to
compute the real wage response in each CZ. Table 6 reports the average and standard deviation of
shock-induced changes in wages (relative to the Chinese wage), employment and real wages.39 We
consider the predicted responses over the entire period between 1990 and 2007.40
The first column of Table 6 shows that, on average, the wage of U.S. CZs fell by 4 log-points
relative to the Chinese wage. Most of the wage decline was driven by the indirect effect of negative
revenue shifts in other CZs. This is a consequence of our finding that indirect effects reinforce
direct effects. The impact of lower consumption costs is positive, but it is not sufficient to offset
the impact of the revenue decline. This follows from the fact that consumption elasticities are
smaller than revenue elasticities. Interestingly, our results indicate large differential effects across
CZs: all component of wage responses exhibit large cross-regional dispersion.
We then turn to the effect of the China shock on employment. Again, revenue shifts lead to
average employment losses, but consumption cost shifts create partially offsetting employment
gains. The sum of all components yields an average employment loss of 2.8 log-points between
1990 and 2007. The impact of the shock on employment varied greatly across U.S. CZs as can be
seen by the large standard deviation of employment responses.
The last two columns report real wage responses across CZs. On average, the China shock
generated a small real gain of 0.16 log-points. This gain was mostly driven by the reduction in
import prices that is captured by the large positive effect of the CZ’s own consumption cost shift.
This more than compensates for the loss in terms-of-trade that followed from the wage reduction
induced by the revenue decline. Notice that, again, the large standard deviation indicates that
these consumption gains varied substantially across CZs. In fact, 39% of U.S. CZs experienced
declines in real wages due to the China shock.
Robustness. Online Appendix A.3 investigates the robustness of our counterfactual predictions
to the alternative specifications of spatial links discussed in Section 6.3. All alternative specifications
yield predicted responses that have a high correlation with the baseline responses. Similar to
the baseline, the average wage decline is close to 4 log-points in all cases. However, the average
employment decline may be stronger or weaker depending on the specification. When we allow for
trade imbalances and migration links, the average employment losses are respectively -4.1 and -5.4
39

Recall that, by Walras’ law, only relative wages are determined in general equilibrium (see discussion in Sections
2 and 3). Without loss of generality, we specify the Chinese wage as the numeraire. This implies that our predicted
wage changes must be interpreted as relative to the Chinese wage.

Online Appendix A.3 reports the same statistics for 1990-2000 and 2000-2007. We find that most of the impact
of the China shock happened in the second period, after China’s accession to WTO in 2001.

employment decline is only 0.5 log-points because this specification entails stronger employment
gains to lower import prices.

Comparison to other specifications of spatial links

In Table 7, we compare our baseline estimates of the effect of the China shock on U.S. CZs
to those obtained from two types of alternative specifications of spatial links in the literature.
Panel A presents changes in employment and wages implied by the simple specifications of
spatial links embedded in the linear regressions presented in Table 1. That is, we aggregate the
predicted responses implied by the linear specification in ADH and its extension with intuitive
parametrizations of indirect effects in equation (38).41 Panel B reports changes in employment and
wages that we compute using the alternative calibrations of spatial links used in Table 5.
The first row of Panel A shows that the simple aggregation of ADH’s specification (column (1)
of Table 1) implies average reductions of 1.2 log-points in wages and 1.5 log-points in employment.
These average changes are less than half of those implied by our baseline specification. The second
row of Panel A shows that, when we extend ADH’s specification by including intuitive measures
of indirect effects (column (3) of Table 1), the average predicted response is much closer to our
baseline average response. This is a consequence of the fact that both our baseline estimates and
the extension of ADH’s specification yield indirect effects that reinforce the negative impact of
the local exposure to import competition. Notice however that the correlations with our baseline
predicted responses are below 0.5, indicating that these simple extensions still miss an important
fraction of the heterogeneity in predicted responses of wages and employment across CZs.
41

We only consider specifications that ignore consumption cost shifts since the effect of these variables is not
statistically significant (see Table 1). Thus, researchers using the reduced-form results in Table 1 would conclude
that consumption cost shifts are not relevant drivers of labor market outcomes across CZs.

39

In Panel B, we compare our baseline results to those implied by two alternative calibrations
of spatial links used in Table 5. In the first row, we eliminate agglomeration forces, but keep
other parameters unchanged. In this case, predicted responses remain highly correlated with
our baseline responses. However, they become substantially smaller: the standard deviation of
predicted responses falls by more than 80%. In fact, the average employment loss is close to zero.
This results from the removal of the amplification channel of agglomeration forces (see Section 3).
This is also consistent with the model fit coefficients in column (4) of Table 5, which suggest that
employment responses were too small, such that they had to be multiplied by a factor of nine to
match the cross-regional variation in the data.
In the last row of Panel B, we further change the labor supply specification imposing that
p
−φ = φw = 0.7, as in column (5) of Table 5. In this case, the positive impact of lower import
prices on employment dominates in the aggregate, implying a small increase in average employment.
Across CZs, the correlation with our baseline predicted responses falls substantially – it was 0.65
in the first row, but it is only 0.35 in the second row. This is because this parametrization induces
responses to import prices that are too strong compared to those in the data.

Conclusions

For a general class of spatial models, we show that changes in labor market outcomes, as a result
of foreign shocks, can be written as the product of two components. First, the partial equilibrium
impact of trade shocks on markets, which takes the form of shift-share variables. Second, the
general equilibrium reduced-form elasticities that summarize how local outcomes respond directly
40

to the local shock exposure and indirectly to the shock exposure of other markets through spatial
links. We use these results to propose a novel estimation strategy that extends existing empirical
shift-share specifications to measure the general equilibrium impact of trade shocks on local labor
markets. Our empirical strategy recovers the general equilibrium reduced-form elasticities using
the response of labor market outcomes to the exposure of different regions to observed trade
shocks, such as the China shock in ADH. These elasticities can then be used to aggregate the
shock exposure of different markets to compute the general equilibrium impact of trade shocks on
employment, wages, and real wages.
While our methodology differs from existing quantitative approaches, our empirical findings are
ultimately ones that quantitative analyses need to reckon with. For that purpose, we devise a new
model validation procedure that makes additional use of cross-regional variation in shock exposure.
The procedure uncovers the ability of different variants of the model to come to grips with empirical
estimates of the differential response of labor market outcomes in regions with higher exposure
to observed trade shocks. We feel, to some extent, that this procedure achieves the standards
set by Kehoe (2005): ‘‘Ex-post performance evaluations of applied GE models are essential if
policymakers are to have confidence in the results produced by these models. Such evaluations also
help make applied GE analysis a scientific discipline in which there are well-defined puzzles with
clear successes and failures for competing theories’’. We hope, therefore, that our approach will
lead to a better understanding of the role of spatial links in shaping the impact of trade shocks on
regional labor markets.

Proofs

8.1

Proof of Proposition 1

We now establish the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium wage vector of our economy. Consider
the solution w∗ of the system Di (w∗ |τ ) = 0 for all i, and the following two lemmas.

Lemma 1. [Arrow and Hahn (1971) T.1.3 (p. 33)] Suppose that Fi (·) is a function defined for every
w ∈ RN
such that Fi (·) is (i) differentiable, (ii) homogeneous of degree 0, (iii) satisfies Walras’ law,
PN ++
(iv) there exists a scalar s such that Fi (w) < s for every w, and (v) if
i=1 wi Fi (w) = 0 for all w,P
∗
wn → w with wm = 0, then i Fi (wn ) → −∞. Then, there exists w∗ ∈ RN
++ such that Fi (w ) = 0 for
all i.

Lemma 2. [Arrow and Hahn (1971) T.9.12 (p. 234)] Suppose that Fi (·) satisfies the conditions in
∗

∂Fi (w )
∗
∗
Lemma 1. Assume that, for any w∗ ∈ RN
satisfies (i)
+ with Fi (w ) = 0 for all i, fij (w ) ≡
∂wj

fii (w ) > 0 and (ii) ∃{hi (w )}i,m  0 such that hi (w )fii (w ) > j6=i,m |fij (w )|hj (w ) for all i 6= m.
∗
Then, there is a unique w∗ ∈ RN
++ such that Fi (w ) = 0 for all i.

We consider the function Fi (w) ≡ − w1i Di (w|τ ) with Di (w|τ ) defined by (9) and P (w|τ ) implicitly
defined as the solution of (8) with po given by (5). In this proof, we simplify notation by denoting
P (w|τ ) as P (w). Notice that the definition of P (w) implies that P (κw) = κP (w). We now establish
the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium wage vector by verifying that Assumption 1 implies all
conditions in Lemmas 1 and 2.

1. The function Fi (w) is differentiable because it only combines differentiable functions.

2. We now verify that the system is homogeneous of degree 0. Since Fi (κw) = − κw

Proof of Theorem 2

We re-define the system in (11) to set the change in the wage of market m to zero. Consider the matrix
M̄ obtained by deleting the m-th row from the identity matrix with dimension equal to the number of
0
markets. If M̄ γ̄ M̄ is nonsingular, then we can write


M̄ ŵ = M̄ γ̄ M̄
M̄ η̂,

0

which yields the representation in (17) when we define β̄ ≡ M̄ (M̄ γ̄ M̄ )−1 M̄ .
0
In the rest of the proof, we first show that M̄ γ̄ M̄ is nonsingular and then establish that β̄ admits
the series representation in (18). To simplify exposition, we abuse notation by defining
0

γ̄ ≡ M̄ γ̄ M̄ ,

ŵ ≡ M̄ ŵ

and

η̂ ≡ M̄ η̂.

This modified system does not include the row associated with the market clearing condition of market
m and imposes that ŵm = 0. To obtain a characterization for the solution of this system, let κ̄ be the
diagonal matrix with the diagonal elements of γ̄: κ̄ = [κij ] s.t. κii = γii and κij = 0 for i 6= j. Thus,
we can write the system as

¯
¯ ≡ Ī − κ̄−1 γ̄,
γ̄ = κ̄ Ī − γ̃
st γ̃
which implies that γ̃ii = 0 and γ̃ij = −γij /γii .
Consider the vector {hi }i6=m  0 that guarantees the diagonal dominance of γ̄ in the initial equilibrium.
Let h̄ be the diagonal matrix such that hi is the diagonal entry in row i. Thus, the system in (11) is
equivalent to

We start by showing that the gross

P
1. As shown in Appendix 8.6, j γij P
= 0 for all i,P
which implies that γii = − j6=i γij for all i. Thus,
γij < 0 for all i 6= j implies that γii = j6=i |γij | > j6=i,m |γij | for any numeraire m. Thus, Assumption
1 holds and Theorem 2 immediately implies the expression in (18). Since γij < 0 for all i 6= j, γ̃ij ≥ 0 for
(d)
all i and j and, therefore, γ̃ij ≥ 0 for all i, j and d.

We abuse notation by defining the matrix γ̄ after dropping the numeraire market: γ̄ ≡ γ Ī − Iγ̃ 0 ,

Data Construction

This appendix describes the procedure to construct bilateral trade flows among 722 US CZs and 52
countries in 1990 and 2000 for 367 4-digit SIC manufacturing industries and one non-manufacturing sector.

Summary Statistics

We start by reporting in Table 8 summary statistics for the main variables in our empirical application.
The dispersion of employment changes is higher than that of wage changes in both periods. Our main shock
exposure measures IP Wit and IP Cit have larger average and dispersion in 2000-2007 than in 1990-2000.
This arises because the increase in imports from China was stronger after China’s accession to WTO in
2001. Finally, the measures of the CZ’s indirect shock exposure have lower dispersion than the measure of
the CZ’s own exposure.

Methodology

Country-to-country bilateral trade matrix. We start by creating a country-to-country matrix of
trade flows at the 4-digit SIC classification. We consider the countries listed in Table 9.
We obtain international trade flows at the product-country level from the BACI dataset, assembled by
CEPII, which we aggregate at the 4-digit SIC level. Since the starting year of the BACI dataset is 1995,
we use the trade flows for 1995 and 2000.42 To obtain domestic spending shares for each country, we note

compute btk as average the material to payroll ratio across all U.S. non-manufacturing industries in the

CZ-to-CZ bilateral trade matrix. We follow three steps to impute trade flows across CZs using the
gravity trade structure of our model. First, for each SCTG category, we use state-to-state shipment data
from the Commodity Flow Survey in 1997 to estimate
ln Xij,s = δs + β1 lnDij + β2 ln Ej,s + β3 ln Yi,s + β4 di=j + εij,s

(62)

where i is the origin state, j is the destination state, s is the SCTG sector, Dij is the distance between i
and j, Ej,s are expenditures, Yi,s are production, di=j is a dummy that equals 1 when i = j.
Second, we use the estimated coefficients to impute trade flows across CZs with the following gravity
specification:
t
t
t
ln Xij,s
≡ β̂1 lnDij + β̂2 ln ξ˜j,s
+ β̂3 ln ỹi,s
+ β̂4 dstate(i)=state(j)
(63)
where Dij is the distance between CZ i and j, and dstate(i)=state(j) is a dummy equal 1 if i and j belong to
the same state.
Lastly, we re-scale the imputed CZ-to-CZ trade flows to sum to the total US domestic sales in each
SIC sector (as in the country-to-country trade matrix).
43
The final consumption shares vary across sectors but not across CZs. We take this approach because we are not
aware of any comprehensive data on final consumption shares by CZ. The Consumer Expenditure Survey produced
by the BLS only covers 26 selected MSA and does not vary by manufacturing sectors. We verify that, across these
MSAs, consumption shares in the CEX display little variation – for instance, the average share of consumption on
food and apparel is 19%, with a standard deviation of only 2% across MSAs.
44
We construct state-sector exports and imports as follows. First, we use the US Merchandise Trade Data for
1997 released by the US Census to create a mapping from each of the 44 US districts to the 50 US states, in
terms of share of imports and exports to each foreign country. Note that this is done at the aggregate level as this
information is not available at the industry-level. We then use US Census data to create district-level exports and
imports at the HS-6 level for 1997. Finally, we use the mapping previously constructed to obtain state-HS6, and
then state-SIC 4 digit, trade flows with our sample of foreign countries.

61

Trade balance. Finally, we impose that trade is balanced at the regional level, as in the baseline model.
We use the trade flows obtained above to compute matrix x̄t whose entries correspond to the share of
spending of each region j on another region i. Under trade balance, the vector of total revenue in the
world economy, Y t , must satisfy x̄t Y t = Y t and, therefore, (Ī − x̄t )Y t = 0. Notice
that it is always
P
possible to find a vector Y t that satisfies this system since (Ī − x̄t ) is singular ( i xtij = 1 for every j).
Thus, we find the vector Y t as the eigenvectorPof (Ī − x̄t ) associated with the eigenvalue of zero. We
then normalize it such that world GDP is one, i Yit = 1.

t constructed in equation (61) and
We first evaluate the correlation between the expenditure shares ξi,s
the spending shares implied by the shipment data for US states. To this end, for each of the 40 SCTG
categories, we compute state-level total shipment inflow in the Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) for 1997.
We then aggregate our expenditure shares at the SCTG level using a crosswalk between SIC-4 and SCTG
categories, and compute total spending by state-SCTG using the size of the CZs in the state. Table 10
reports the result of a regression of the expenditure shares in the CFS on our constructed spending shares
in 1990 and 2000. We can see that they are positively and significantly correlated, with an OLS coefficient
close to 1 and a R2 of 0.95.
We then proceed to assess whether our constructed CZ-level trade matrix reproduces the patterns of
observed trade flows for US states. We use the CFS to measure bilateral shipments between US states in
each SCTG category for 1997, 2002 and 2007. To obtain comparable data, we use the methodology in
Appendix 9.2 to construct the trade matrix for CZs and SIC industries for 1997, 2002, and 2007. We then
aggregate this data at the state-SCTG level in each year.
Table 11 reports the results of regressing actual shipment data on the corresponding trade flow
obtained from our trade matrix. Column (1) considers domestic flows between US states, column (2)
considers export flows from US states to foreign countries, and column (3) considers import flows from
foreign countries to US states. All specifications include sector fixed-effects. We can see that the predicted
trade flows are significantly and positively related to the actual flows, with coefficients close to 1. Notice
also that our imputed data captures a large share of the variation in bilateral trade flows. The R2 is
above 0.8 for exports and imports of US states, and around 0.5 for domestic flows between US states.

Notes: The dependent variable in column (1) is the actual shipment flow reported in the CFS for state-state-SCTG triples. The
dependent variables in columns (2) and (3) are trade flows constructed from the US Census trade data for state-country-SCTG triples.
The regressors are the trade flows constructed using our methodology for the years 1997, 2002 and 2007, aggregate at the state-stateSCTG or state-country-SCTG level. All regressions include sector fixed effects. Robust standard errors in parentheses. *** p < 0.01,
