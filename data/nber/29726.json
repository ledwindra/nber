    "abstract": "\n\nThe view that empirical strategies in economics should be transparent and credible now goes almost without saying. The local average treatment effects (LATE) framework for causal inference helped make this so. The LATE theorem tells us for whom particular instrumental variables (IV) and regression discontinuity estimates are valid. This lecture uses several empirical examples, mostly involving charter and exam schools, to highlight the value of LATE. A surprising exclusion restriction, an assumption central to the LATE interpretation of IV estimates, is shown to explain why enrollment at Chicago exam schools reduces student achievement. I also make two broader points: IV exclusion restrictions formalize commitment to clear and consistent explanations of reduced-form causal effects; compelling applications demonstrate the power of simple empirical strategies to generate new causal knowledge.\n\n",

Many thanks to Jimmy Chin and Vendela Norman for their help preparing this lecture and to Noam Angrist, Hank Farber, Peter Ganong, Guido Imbens, and Parag Pathak for comments on an earlier draft. Thanks also go to my coauthors and Blueprint Labs colleagues, from whom I\u2019ve learned so much over the years. Special thanks are due to my co-laureates, David Card and Guido Imbens, for their guidance and partnership. We three share a debt to our absent friend, Alan Krueger, with whom we collaborated so fruitfully. This lecture incorporates empirical findings from joint work with Atila Abdulkadiro\u011flu, Sue Dynarski, Bill Evans, Iv\u00e1n Fern\u00e1ndez-Val, Tom Kane, Victor Lavy, Yusuke Narita, Parag Pathak, Chris Walters, and Rom\u00e1n Z\u00e1rate.
