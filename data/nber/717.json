    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper presents an analytical framework that can be used to analyze the effects of unions on productivity in the public sector. Our initial focus is on public libraries because considerable effort has been devoted to conceptualizing library productivity measures and because of the availability of data to implement the framework. Preliminary estimates are presented based upon data from 71 municipal libraries in Massachusetts. We conclude by indicating the direction that our future research on the subject will take.\n\n",
