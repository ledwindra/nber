The Decline, Rebound, and Further Rise in SNAP Enrollment: Disentangling Business Cycle
Fluctuations and Policy Changes

ABSTRACT
Approximately 1-in-7 people and 1-in-4 children received benefits from the US Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program (SNAP) in July 2011, both all-time highs. We analyze changes in SNAP take-up
over the past two decades. From 1994 to 2001, coincident with welfare reform, take-up fell from 75%
to 54% of eligible people. The take-up rate then rebounded, and, following several policy changes
to improve program access, stabilized at 69% in 2007. Finally, take-up and enrollment rose dramatically
in the Great Recession, with take-up reaching 87% in 2011. We find that changes in local unemployment
can explain at least two-thirds of the increase in enrollment from 2007 to 2011. Increased state adoption
of relaxed income and asset thresholds and temporary changes in program rules for childless adults
explain 18% of the increase. Total SNAP spending today is 6% higher than it would be without these
increases in eligibility. The recession-era increase in benefit levels is also likely to have increased
enrollment.

Introduction

In July 2011, 45.3 million people were enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), fifteen percent of the US population.2 This
is a sharp increase from 26.6 million and nine percent of the population in
July 2007. There has been considerable debate about the growth in SNAP
enrollment in the aftermath of the recession. Researchers at the US Department of Agriculture (Hanson and Oliveira (2012), USDA) analyzed national
annual time series evidence and concluded that the increase in unemployment
rates can explain most of the growth, while Mulligan (2012) finds that changes
in SNAP policies played a central role. In this paper, we attempt to explain
trends in SNAP enrollment over the past twenty years, and bring new data to
bear on the debate over current SNAP enrollment.
Figure 1 shows estimates of the percent of the population enrolled in SNAP
and the SNAP take-up rate. Because household income is volatile and not
all the information needed to establish eligibility is available in household
surveys, it is quite diﬃcult to estimate the number of people who are eligible
for SNAP at a point in time. Mathematica Policy Research (Eslami et al.
(2012)) produces estimates of eligibility using data on annual income in the
March Current Population Survey, combined with adjustment procedures for
a variety of program requirements including legal residency, asset tests, and
work requirements.3 Changes in estimated take-up closely track changes in the
percent of the population enrolled in SNAP. Take-up fell from 75% in 1994
to 54% in 2001. It then rebounded up to 69% in 2006. Enrollment and takeup then remained stable through 2008. Finally, take-up rose significantly in

The 2008 Farm Bill changed the program name from the “Food Stamp Program” to the
“Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.” We use SNAP throughout the paper to refer
to this program, regardless of time period.

Cunnyngham and Smith (2013) provide a detailed description of the methodology for
2010. Mathematica reports do not provide a consistent time series because of changes over
time in their methodology. We attempt to construct a consistent time series by splicing
together the Mathematica estimates. See notes to Figure 1 for details on how we construct
a consistent time series. Another challenge to producing an estimate of take-up among
eligible individuals is that some recipients may be ineligible and estimates of the fraction of
recipients who are ineligible are imperfect.

the recent recession, reaching 87% in 2011. We use these inflection points in
the take-up rate to organize our analysis into three periods: Welfare Reform,
Bush-Era Modernization, and the Great Recession.
In 1992, Oregon was the first state approved for a major waiver from the
federal government to modify its cash assistance program.4 Over the next
few years, 36 additional states received waivers, culminating in the passage of
federal welfare reform in 1996. Cash assistance receipt declined dramatically,
from 14.0 million individuals in 1994 to 5.6 million in 2000; SNAP receipt
among families with children, as well as among adults who were newly subjected to SNAP time limits by federal welfare reform, declined concurrently.
We demonstrate that states with bigger declines in cash assistance receipt had
bigger declines in SNAP receipt among families with children. We further show
that the change in SNAP enrollment for families with single mothers over this
period can be decomposed into to two equally important factors. First, there
was a decrease in the number of eligible individuals because of rising incomes.
Second, among eligible individuals, there was an increase in the fraction of
individuals with significant earnings and there has historically been a much
lower take-up rate of SNAP benefits among people who are working.
Beginning in 2001, with encouragement from USDA, states implemented
a series of policy changes designed to improve access to SNAP for working
families. States relaxed vehicle ownership rules, redesigned income reporting
requirements, and promoted phone interviews in lieu of face-to-face interviews
for establishing and maintaining eligibility. Enrollment rose, even as the unemployment rate was falling, and the program became more dynamic, with
more people entering and exiting SNAP. In addition, we find evidence of a
“bounceback” from welfare reform – states with bigger declines in cash assistance in the 1990’s experienced bigger increases in SNAP receipt several years
later.
Once the Great Recession began, SNAP enrollment increased rapidly. Our
4

We use the term “cash assistance” to refer to both Aid to Families with Dependent
Children and Transitional Aid to Needy Families.

research assesses the extent to which SNAP enrollment should be viewed as
an “automatic stabilizer,” rising directly in response to unemployment, or as
a deliberate fiscal policy response to the recession. There is a wide consensus
among economists that automatic stabilizers are good policy for responding
to business cycle changes, while there is disagreement over the usefulness of
discretionary fiscal policy.5
We model the relationship between unemployment and SNAP enrollment.
Using family-level data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation
(SIPP), we estimate that changes in unemployment duration alone can explain
about half of the increase in SNAP enrollment from 2007 to 2011. Next,
using county-level data, we find that local area unemployment can explain
between 71% and 98% of the increase in SNAP enrollment, depending on the
specification.6
We examine in detail the eligibility expansions and policy changes which
may also have increased SNAP enrollment during the recession years. We
find that states’ adoption of relaxed income and asset limits (“Broad Based
Categorical Eligibility”) accounts for 8% of the increase in enrollment over this
period. Another feature of SNAP is that program rules for Able-Bodied Adults
Without Dependents (ABAWDs) are temporarily relaxed in places with high
unemployment. Expanded eligibility for ABAWDs during the recession can
explain 10% of the increase in enrollment. We repeat the exercise for spending
and find that BBCE and ABAWD changes are responsible for 3% and 9%
5

See Auerbach (2003) for a critique of fiscal policy responses and Blinder (2006) for
a response to the critics of fiscal policy. Nevertheless, both view automatic stabilizers
favorably. Blanchard et al. (2010) distinguish between two kinds of automatic stabilizers
– progressive tax-and-transfer schedules, which have permanent fiscal costs and incentive
consequences, and temporary policies which respond to unemployment, which they view as
“more promising.” Blundell and Pistaferri (2003) and Gundersen and Ziliak (2003) estimate
the consumption insurance provided by SNAP, which fits Blanchard’s first type of automatic
stabilizer, while this paper highlights the response of SNAP to unemployment, consistent
with Blanchard’s second type of stabilizer. In other recent work, McKay and Reis (2013)
argue that SNAP is particularly eﬀective as an automatic stabilizer.

transfer programs over the business cycle, and report that the response of SNAP and unemployment insurance during the Great Recession was in line with historical patterns.

SNAP benefits in the Recovery Act may have raised take-up, although we are
unable to quantify its impact.

Program Overview

2.1

Program Description

SNAP helps low-income people buy food. A household unit is people who
“purchase and prepare food together.” Eligibility is typically determined by
three tests:
• gross income test – household income must be less than 130% of the
poverty line (in FY2013, 130% of poverty is $1,211/month for one person
and $2,498/month for four people).
• net income test – household income minus deductions must be less than
100% of the poverty line.7
• asset test – assets must be less than $2,000, excluding the recipient’s
home and retirement accounts.
7

There is a standard deduction of $149 for households with 1 to 3 members (with higher
amounts for larger households), a 20% earned income deduction, a medical expense deduction for households with elderly or disabled members, a child care deduction, and a
deduction for households with very high shelter costs. http://www.massresources.org/snapfinancial-eligibility.html oﬀers a clear description of these rules.

5

Households with a disabled person or a member whose age is 60 or above need
to pass only the net income test (not gross income), and face a less stringent
asset threshold of $3,250. Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents who are
working less than half time or do not meet certain work requirements are
limited to receiving benefits for 3-months out of each 36-month period.
Program applicants must participate in an interview and provide documentation of legal residency, income, and expenses. Then, recipients need to
complete a recertification on a recurring basis every 6 to 24 months.
Households receive an electronic benefit transfer card, which can be used to
purchase food at supermarkets, grocery stores, and convenience stores. About
84% of benefits are spent at supermarkets (Castner and Henke (2011)). A
household’s benefit is equal to the maximum benefit, minus 30% of its net
income. In fiscal year 2011, the maximum monthly benefit was $200 for one
person (mean $146) and $668 for four people (mean $482).
States administer the program, determining eligibility and issuing benefits.
The cost of benefits is paid entirely by the federal government, through USDA.
Administrative costs are split between the state and federal government. Each
year, about 50,000 active cases are randomly selected for audits through the
Quality Control (QC) system, and the results are used to calculate a state’s
payment error rate. In FY2011, the oﬃcial national overpayment error rate
was 3.0%, and the underpayment error rate was 0.8%. States with persistently
high error rates incur financial penalties.
Economists have done substantial research on the impacts of SNAP on
recipients. A recent series of papers by Hilary Hoynes, Diane Whitmore
Schanzenbach, and coauthors uses the county-level rollout of SNAP to study
the program’s impacts. Almond et al. (2011) find that program exposure
raised birth weights, and Hoynes and Schanzenbach (2009) find that the program raised food expenditures. Evidently, program recipients face significant
cash constraints, with lower caloric intake at the end of the monthly benefit
6

cycle (Shapiro (2005)). Hastings and Washington (2010) show that supermarket prices respond modestly to changes in demand by benefit recipients;
the magnitude of price responses is likely to be small because recipients shop
alongside non-recipients.

2.2

Methodology for Constructing Time series Patterns
in Enrollment and Flows

Mathematica Policy Research uses the QC data to construct a public use
file each year that is representative of the national SNAP caseload.8
Figure 2 shows trends in SNAP receipt by household type using the QC
data. We divide households into three mutually-exclusive groups:
1. “Families with Children” – household has at least one child (under age
18).
2. “Adults” – household has no children and at least one non-senior adult
(ages 18-59).
3. “Seniors” – all household members are seniors (at least age 60).

In the top panel, we show the size of each group on SNAP as a share of the total
US population. In 1991, families with children accounted for 84% of SNAP
recipients, households with adults (and no children) were 11% of recipients,
and households with seniors were 5% of recipients. To better highlight changes
in SNAP receipt by household type, we construct an index for enrollment
relative to 1991 levels shown in the bottom panel. To control for changes
8

Files from fiscal year 1996 forward are posted at http://hostm142.mathematicampr.com/fns/. Leftin et al. (2012) provides documentation for the most recent file. We
limit our analysis to the fifty states plus D.C. Throughout our analysis, we use variables
fywgt for household weight to match national caseloads and certhhsz for the number of
post-audit household members.

in demographic structure, we use the March Current Population Survey to
estimate the total US population in each household type j in each year t. We
calculate

The QC files can also be used to estimate flows into and out of SNAP, as
shown in Figure 3. We flag a case as a new entrant if the most recent action on
the case was a certification, rather than a recertification (actntype==1) and the
most recent certification occurred in the previous three months (lastcert<=2).9
We observe total participants SN APt , SN APt−1 , and entert in the QC files,
and calculate exitt using the statistical identity:
SN APt − SN APt−1 = entert − exitt

(2)

In Figure 3, we plot entry and exit as a share of the US population.10

Welfare Reform, 1991-2001

In this section, we analyze changes in SNAP from 1991 to 2001, with
particular attention to the role of welfare reform in causing people to leave
SNAP. We use the QC files and the SIPP to show that SNAP receipt declined
more in demographic groups most aﬀected by welfare reform, in states where
cash assistance caseloads dropped the most, and for people receiving cash
assistance at the time of the 1996 welfare reform legislation.
9

Before FY95, lastcert is often missing, and we instead identify entrants using
(actntype==1) combined with the date the case was opened (rcntopen). For 1995, when
both variables are available, we find that using the most recent action date yields a quarterly
entrance rate of 15% and using the case opening date yields a quarterly entrance rate of
19%.
10
In Appendix Figure 1, we show entry rates – entrances as share of the unenrolled
(EntryRatet = entert /(popt − SN APt )) and exit rates – exits as a share of enrollment
(ExitRatet = exitt /SN APt ). These rates have the attractive feature that they are scaled
by the exposed population and therefore can allow more natural comparisons of transition
rates across time periods with widely varying SNAP participation rates.

8

From 1993 to 1999, the number of cash assistance recipients in the US
fell dramatically. An unusually strong labor market and expansions of the
Earned Income Tax Credit led single mothers to transition from cash assistance
receipt to work (Meyer and Rosenbaum (2001)). Welfare reform played an
important role as well: the first major waivers for changes in state welfare
policy were given in 1992. By the time President Clinton signed the Personal
Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act (PRWORA) in 1996, 37 states had
already received waivers. Currie and Grogger (2001) estimate a state-level
model and find that the improving economy can explain about 30% and welfare
reform can explain about 20% of the decrease in SNAP receipt from 1993 to
1998.
Both panels of Figure 2 show that SNAP receipt fell relative to the overall
population beginning in 1993, with the rate of decline increasing after welfare
reform in 1996. The new law also revoked SNAP eligibility for many legal
immigrants.11 Families with children, who were leaving cash assistance, show
the biggest declines in SNAP receipt. Adults, some of whom were newly subjected by PRWORA to a 3-months-out-of-36 time limit for SNAP receipt, also
show large declines. Seniors, who presumably were least aﬀected by welfare reform, show the smallest declines. Figure 3 shows that through 1993, entrances
exceed exits, and caseloads were rising. After this point, as the economy recovered and states began experimenting with welfare reform, exits substantially
exceed entrances, and caseloads begin to fall. As cash assistance recipients
transitioned to work, we calculate in the QC files that the share of people in
SNAP families with children reporting earned income rose from 30% to 45%.
State-level evidence points to a link between the intensity of welfare reform
and SNAP receipt. Because the timing of welfare reform varied across states,
11

The number of eligible noncitizens fell from 2.71 million in 1994 to 1.33 million in 2000,
and SNAP receipt fell even more sharply, from 1.81 million to 0.59 million, over the same
period (Cunnyngham (2002)). Borjas (2004) uses this policy change to study the eﬀect
of public assistance on food insecurity and finds that a 10 percentage point reduction in
the fraction of the population that receives public assistance increases the fraction of foodinsecure households by about 5 percentage points.

9

we define t(peak) as the year in which a state j reached its maximum number
of cash assistance recipients. For 41 states, this occurred between 1992 and
1994. Cashj,t(peak) is the number of people receiving cash assistance in the
peak year in state j. We measure the intensity of welfare reform as the change
�
�
from the peak to five years later log Cashj,t(peak)+5 − log Cashj,t(peak) and
compare this to the change in SNAP receipt over the same time period. We
regress
�

�

log SN APj,t(peak)+5 −log SN APj,t(peak) = α+β log Cashj,t(peak)+5 − log Cashj,t(peak) +εjt(peak)
(3)
The top panel of Figure 4 shows a strong, statistically significant correlation:
a 10 log point decrease in cash assistance receipt is associated with about a
3 log point decrease in SNAP receipt among families with children.12 This
suggests that at the state level, the intensity of welfare reform was correlated
with changes in SNAP receipt. Cash assistance receipt fell on average by 65
log points in the five years after a state’s peak, and SNAP receipt fell by
an average of 34 log points, so the change in SNAP receipt implied by the
cross-sectional coeﬃcient (0.29*65=18.9) is about half of the observed drop in
SNAP receipt. This means that above and beyond any changes in the national
economy or national policies, changes in state-level conditions were important
in explaining changes in SNAP receipt.13
12

An alternative specification uses a common time period, of 1994 to 1999. We drop Idaho
and Wyoming, which are extreme outliers in their change in cash assistance. Here, we find a
coeﬃcient of 0.12, which is statistically significant at a 10% level. We find this specification
less attractive because it does not account for heterogeneity in when states began changing
their welfare programs, as discussed above.
13
Two pieces of evidence suggest that the state-level correlation between welfare reform
and SNAP receipt is not simply the result of state economic conditions aﬀecting caseloads for
both transfer programs. First, our welfare reform measure has only a weak correlation with
changes in the contemporaneous unemployment rate. A 10 log point decrease in caseloads
from peak is associated with an additional decrease of 0.05 percentage points in the state
unemployment rate (not statistically significant). Adding the state unemployment rate as a
regressor in the regression specified in equation 3 has barely any impact on the coeﬃcent on
the change in cash assistance. Because measurement error in the state unemployment rate
could bias downward the impact of the unemployment rate in the regression, we find the
more direct evidence from regressing the unemployment rate on the change in caseloads to be
more informative. Second, when we regress changes in cash assistance caseloads on changes

10

To further explore the connection between welfare reform and SNAP receipt, we use the March CPS together with the QC files to study SNAP enrollment by single mothers with children from 1993 through 1999. In particular,
we use the CPS data to distinguish among three explanations for the decline
in SNAP receipt: (1) mothers increased their employment and were no longer
eligible, (2) mothers increased their employment, were still eligible, but because SNAP take-up rates are lower among those with earnings, their SNAP
participation fell, and (3) changes in public assistance administrative practices or individual preferences reduced take-up among people with a given set
of characteristics.14
First, we divide the sample of single mothers in the CPS by whether or
not their income was below 130% of poverty each year – suggesting whether
they were likely to be eligible for SNAP. We then sub-divide the likely-eligible
sample into four groups: “Work Only”, “Cash Assistance Only”, “Work and
Cash”, or “Neither Work Nor Cash”. We define a family as “working” if they
have annual earnings equal to at least 25% of the annual poverty line and as
“receiving cash assistance” if they report assistance equal to at least 10% of
the annual poverty line. The proportion of people in each group is shown in
the top panel of Appendix Table 1. We see a decline in the share of single
mothers who are likely to be eligible for SNAP from 63% to 53%. Among that
pool of likely eligibles, we see a sharp decrease in the share receiving only cash
assistance. This is oﬀset by a large increase in the share of single mothers
only working, as well as an increase in the share who are neither working nor
receiving cash assistance.
Next, we calculate the number of SNAP recipients in each of these four cells
using data from the QC. As a secondary measure, we also construct estimates
in SNAP receipt for adults and seniors – populations that were less aﬀected by state-level
welfare reform activities – we find a smaller and statistically insignificant coeﬃcient. This
is evidence that the welfare reform variable reflects state-level policy changes, and not just
changes in the state’s labor market situation.
14
Narrative accounts of welfare reform implementation suggest that when people left cash
assistance for work they often did not realize (and welfare oﬃces made little eﬀort to tell
them) that they remained eligible for SNAP (Government Accountability Oﬃce (1999)).

11

of the number of SNAP recipients in each cell from the CPS, even though
the CPS measure suﬀers from significant underreporting. These estimates are
presented in the second and third panels of Appendix Table 1.
The bottom two panels of Appendix Table 1 also report ratios within each
cell of QC recipient totals to CPS population totals and of CPS recipient
totals to CPS population totals. Computing the ratio with the QC data in the
numerator and CPS data in the denominator gives us a number analogous to a
take-up rate. Such a comparison is likely to be imperfect because the QC files
are based on monthly data, while the CPS is based on annual interview data,
and because cash assistance receipt for single mothers is underreported in the
CPS. In particular, there are more single moms in the QC data with Cash
Only than there are in the CPS and the ratio is not constrained to be below
1.15 Nevertheless, such a comparison is useful for examining trends over time.
The ratio is highest for the Cash Only group, with an average value of 1.53,
and lowest for the Work Only group, with an average value of 0.49. Notably,
all four ratios are fairly stable over this time period. The ratio for the Work
and Cash group shows evidence of an increase, but this is the smallest group
in absolute magnitude and is therefore most likely to have imprecise ratio
estimates. CPS-based results are similar. Within each cell, there is very little
change over time in the ratio of SNAP recipients to SNAP-eligible families.
These take-up ratios allow for a unique decomposition of changes in SNAP
receipt, first by changes in income eligibility, and then, among income-eligible
individuals, by changes in work and cash assistance status.
SN APt+6 − SN APt = ∆Elig ∗ T akeU pt + ∆T akeU p ∗ Eligt+6
15

(4)

This comparison is made more diﬃcult because, as documented by Meyer et al. (2009),
the underreporting of cash assistance in the CPS is rising during this period. Interpreting
results from changes in this ratio as changes in take-up requires an assumption that reporting
rates for cash assistance are constant. The ratio of the administrative monthly enrollment
total from HHS to the CPS total using our method falls from 104% in 1993 to 87% in
1999. We rescale our cells each year to match changes in this aggregate reporting ratio.
Eﬀectively, this assumes that there is no diﬀerential reporting of earnings in the CPS among
cash assistance recipients as compared to non-recipients.

12

∆T akeU p =

�
j

∆W orkCashj ∗ T akeU pjt + ∆T akeU pj ∗ W orkCashj,t+6 (5)

Table 1 shows the results of this decomposition. The first column shows our
preferred QC-based estimates. Overall, of the 4.4 million person decrease in
SNAP receipt among people in families headed by single mother, about half
(2.18 million) is due to decreases in eligibility, holding take-up fixed. The rest
of the decrease is due to a shift among people who remained eligible from the
high take-up category of only receiving cash assistance to the two lower-take
up categories of work only and neither work nor cash assistance. The results
with the CPS-based measure of SNAP receipt are similar. Changes in take-up
ratios within each cell do not play an important role. In other words, in terms
of the theories outlined on the previous page, we find evidence consistent with
theories (1) and (2), but not theory (3). Whether policy makers intended to
have families who remained income eligible lose SNAP receipt when they left
cash assistance is unclear.

Bush-Era Modernization, 2001-2007

The national SNAP take-up rate reached a low point in 2001, with 54% of
eligible individudals receiving benefits. It then began a steady march upward
to 69% in 2006 and 2007. Eligibility rose from 31.2 million in 2001 to 34.4
million in 2002, due largely to changes in vehicle rules, and then roughly kept
pace with population growth to reach 37.1 million people in 2007 (Eslami et al.
(2012)).16 Meanwhile, SNAP enrollment rose from 17.5 million in July 2001
to 26.6 million in July 2007. Two factors can explain most of the increase
in take-up during this period: policy changes intended to improve access to
SNAP for working families and a bounceback from welfare reform.
Under the Bush administration, led by Under Secretary Eric Bost, there
were several policy changes, designed in particular to make it easier to combine
work and SNAP receipt. In 2001, Bost testified before Congress:
16

See Table 1 of Cunnyngham (2002) for estimates of the contribution of vehicle rules
changes to 2002 eligibility estimates.

13

Concerns have grown that the program’s administrative burden
and complexity are hampering its performance in the post-welfare
reform environment. There is growing recognition that the complexity of program requirements – often the result of desires to
target benefits more precisely – may cause error and deter participation among people eligible for benefits... These burdens are
particularly significant for the working families that comprise an
increasing portion of the Food Stamp caseload. Caseworkers are
often expected to anticipate changes in their income and expenses –
a diﬃcult and error-prone task, especially for working poor households whose incomes fluctuate... (Bost (2001))

Most of these policy changes were implemented by giving states waivers from
program rules, allowing states to verify eligiblity in new ways. For example,
states were give permisson to set up call centers and conduct eligibility and
recertification interviews over the phone, making it easier for people who are
not available to come into a welfare oﬃce during work hours to meet program
requirements. Similarly, most states reduced the frequency at which they collected updated income data from recipients and recalculated benefits. Reduced
income reporting requirements eased participation for low-income households
with volatile earnings.
During this period, SNAP receipt rose for all three types of families, as
shown in Figure 2. Of particular note is that program receipt became more
dynamic, as shown in Figure 3. In 2000, 1.1% of the US population was
entering and exiting SNAP each quarter, as shown in Figure 3. By 2005,
1.5% of people were entering and exiting each quarter. Because, as Bost says,
families with marginal labor force attachment will experience greater changes
in eligibility from month to month, improved access for working families would
likely manifest itself with increased entrances and exits. Acs and Schwabish
(2011) find using microdata from the SIPP that “Recipients who combine food
stamps and work in the same four month period are substantially more likely
14

to exit the program and exit the program with earnings than adults who do
not mix food stamps and work.” In the QC files, SNAP enrollment rose both
for families with earnings and for families without earnings.17
In Table 2, we show the number of states implementing various policies by
year, as reported in the SNAP Policy Database.18 Three particularly important changes were to income reporting, recertification periods, and interview
structure:

• Simplified Reporting – Under default program rules in 2001, SNAP recipients were required to report any change in income. USDA first gave
states waivers requiring the reporting of only significant income changes
(e.g. a $100 change in monthly income). This culminated in simplified
reporting, where SNAP recipients were required to report income changes
between six-month recertification dates only if the income changes made
them ineligible for benefits. By 2007, 47 states had adopted simplified
reporting.
• Recertification Lengths – After welfare reform, many states had implemented recertifications of three months or shorter. Longer intervals between recertifications for people with earnings reduce the cost of participating in the program on an annual basis. Kabbani and Wilde (2003)
and Ribar et al. (2008) study the impact of recertification intervals on
SNAP take-up. In 2001, 25 states were using certification intervals of
three months or less for many people with earnings, but by 2007, all 50
states and DC had stopped using such short intervals.
17

An increase in SNAP receipt among families without earnings may occur in conjunction
with greater labor market activity by low-income families, if families with fluctuating earnings enroll only when they have zero earnings, but not when they have positive earnings. It
is also possible that attempts to make SNAP participation easier for eligible households with
earnings spilled over into a general eﬀort to make participation easier for eligible households
either through changes in administrative behavior or through changes in awareness about
program eligibility.

• Interview Format – Under default program rules in 2001, SNAP applicants were required to do a face-to-face interview to establish eligibility
and for every recertification, unless the household had demonstrated difficulty with completing such an interview. Over time, USDA gave states
waivers allowing phone interviews, first for recertification, and then later
for initial certifications. By 2007, 22 states had received a waiver of the
face-to-face requirement for recertifications.

Other innovations during this period include the establishment of call centers
(20 states by 2007), online applications (14 states by 2007), and the Supplemental Security Income Combined Application Project (SSI CAP), which
eased enrollment procedures for SSI recipients(12 states by 2007).19
In addition, there were rule changes which may have raised enrollment by
expanding eligibility, but should not directly have aﬀected estimated take-up:20

• Vehicle Exemptions – Under default program rules in 2001, the value of
a family’s vehicles above an exemption counted towards the asset test.21
Over time, states were given flexibility to revise their vehicle policies. By
2007, 46 states exempted at least one vehicle completely from the asset
test.
• Legal Immigrants – The 2002 Farm Bill reinstated eligibility for some
legal immigrants whose eligibility had been revoked in PRWORA. By
2007, about 0.94 million legal immigrants were receiving SNAP, an increase from 0.59 million in 2000 (Leftin and Wolkwitz (2009)).
19

Dickert-Conlin et al. (2011) analyze the eﬀect of radio ads and Schwabish (2012) analyzes
the eﬀect of online applications.
20
Leftin et al. (2012), and its counterparts for prior years, adjust the number of eligibles in
response to changes in rules for vehicles and legal immigrants. They drop recipients eligible
through BBCE from both the numerator and denominator of their calculations.
21
For example, the exemption threshold was $4,650 in 2003.

16

• Broad-Based Categorical Eligibility (BBCE)22 – Under default program
rules, eligibility involves a gross income test, a net income test, and an
asset test. BBCE allowed states to eliminate the net income and asset
tests, and also to raise the threshold for the gross income test, up to
200% of poverty. However, states still must set benefits as the maximum
benefit minus 30% of net income. For example, in 2013, a household
with four members and net income at 100% of poverty would receive a
monthly benefit of $92. Put another way, four-member households with
net income of 116% of poverty or higher would not receive any benefits.
This benefit calculation rule sharply limits the scope of the eligibility
expansion; the group most aﬀected is those with substantially higher
gross incomes than net incomes, such as fathers paying child support.
By 2007, 13 states had implemented some form of BBCE. We analyze
BBCE in detail in Section 5.3 and find little new enrollment due to
BBCE.

We regress each of the state-level policies described above on take-up. Empirically, it is diﬃcult to isolate the eﬀect of each policy separately with statistical
precision, so we analyze each policy separately. Using estimates of the SNAP
take-up rate each year by state (see Cunnyngham et al. (2013) for the most
recent estimates), with j indexing states and t indexing years, we use the
specification
T ake − upjt = α + βP olicyjt + ηj + ϕt + εjt

(6)

with ηj state fixed eﬀect and ϕt year fixed eﬀect. Two caveats are in order.
First, even though policies and take-up vary at the state-year level, there is
substantial measurement error in policy adoption.23 Second, our estimates do
22

“Broad-Based Categorical Eligibility” is used to distinguish this new policy from a longstanding “Categorical Eligibility” policy, which made people already receiving cash assistance
automatically eligible for SNAP.
23
For example, Trippe and Gillooly (2010) and Government Accountability Oﬃce (2012)
disagree on the date of BBCE adoption for 7 states.

17

not identify the causal impact of these specific policies, because their adoption
may be markers for other state-level policy changes.
We report results in Figure 5 and Appendix Table 2. Only the coeﬃcients
on simplified reporting and short recertifications are statistically significant.
Finally, we construct an omnibus summary index of all eight policies. The
coeﬃcient on this index implies that switching from the most stringent policies
to the most lenient policies raises the take-up rate by a statistically significant
9.1 percentage points, from a sample mean of 65.2 percent.
We also consider an alternative specification with the percent of population on SNAP (SN APjt /P opjt ) as the dependent variable in equation 6. Here,
we find that BBCE, simplified reporting, call centers, and ending short recertifications have a significant and positive eﬀect on enrollment.24 Using the
summary index, switching to all of the new policies implies a 2.5 percentage
point increase in a state’s population receiving SNAP, from a sample mean of
9.0 percent, and this estimate is statistically significant.
We can use these coeﬃcients to estimate the impact of policy changes on
aggregate takeup and enrollment. The mean for the summary index rose by
0.42 from 2001 to 2007. Using our takeup regression, this implies an increase
in take-up of 3.8 percentage points, one-fourth of the increase in take-up during this period. Alternatively, using our enrollment estimates, this implies
an increase in enrollment of 1.0 percentage points, or about one-third of the
increase in the enrollment during this period. Given the measurement error
regarding the timing of implementation, these estimates are likely to be a lower
bound on the impact of state-level policy changes on SNAP take-up during
this period.25
24

An extensive literature estimates the eﬀect of state SNAP policies on enrollment rates.
Most papers find insignificant coeﬃcients for most policies. Klerman and Danielson (2011),
Mabli and Ferrerosa (2010), and Mabli et al. (2009) report that a state’s adoption of BBCE
had a statistically significant impact on enrollment raising it by 6% and simplified reporting
raised enrollment by about a statistically significant 4%. These estimates are slightly smaller
than the coeﬃcients reported here.
25
Enrollment rose from 5.9% of the US population in 2001 to 8.8% in 2007. Other authors

18

Finally, the rise in SNAP receipt may have been, in part, a bounceback from
welfare reform, a channel overlooked by existing research. In the bottom panel
of Figure 4, we show that states which had bigger declines in cash assistance
receipt in the 1990’s also had bigger increases in SNAP receipt among families
with children in subsequent years (tpeak + 6 to tpeak + 11), with an estimated
coeﬃcient of -0.45. This coeﬃcient likely also reflects, in part, changes in the
state-level economy. We find that a 10 log point decrease in caseloads during
welfare reform is associated with a 0.36 percentage point increase in unemployment over the bounceback period (statistically significant).26 Therefore,
we think that one reason the coeﬃcient for the relationship between changes in
cash assistance caseloads and immediate changes in SNAP is smaller than the
bounceback coeﬃcient is because the bounceback coeﬃcient in part reflects
state-level changes in unemployment.
Overall, the data show an increase in SNAP take-up during this period,
with relatively stable eligibility and a stable poverty rate. It appears that both
specific policy changes to improve access and bounceback from welfare reform
played large roles in rising enrollment.

Great Recession, 2007-2011

The Great Recession coincided with a dramatic increase in SNAP receipt
– from 26.6 million recipients in July 2007 to 45.3 million recipients in July
2011.27 Since then, enrollment has stabilized and was 47.5 million people in
have also run up against measurement error challenges in using state-level policy variables
to explain caseload trends during periods of major policy change. For example, Danielson
and Klerman (2008) find that measured policy variation can explain only about one-fifth of
the measured decline in cash assistance receipt from 1992 to 2005.
26
In addtion, SNAP enrollment for adults and seniors in these states bounced back as
well.
27
These estimates are the national monthly totals published by USDA. In Table 4, we
report the average monthly caseload for Q3 in the QC files, which is 26.04 million recipients
in 2007 and 45.14 million in 2011. Appendix D of Leftin et al. (2012) explains that the
QC counts are slightly lower because they omit families receiving Disaster SNAP and cases

19

April 2013, the month with the most recently available data. Hanson and
Oliveira (2012) used national time series data to examine the correlation between the unemployment rate and SNAP receipt, and concluded that the increase in SNAP participation during the recent recession was “consistent with
the increase during previous periods of economic decline.” 28 In contrast, Mulligan (2012) focuses on policy changes, noting “Millions of households received
safety net benefits in 2010 that would not have been eligible for benefits in
2007 even if their circumstances had been the same in the two years, because
the rules for receiving safety net benefits had changed.” 29
We perform three sets of analysis to explore the sources of the increase in
SNAP take-up during this period. First, we estimate the relationship between
unemployment and SNAP receipt at the family level. Next we examine the
connection between unemployment and SNAP receipt at the county level. Finally we examine in detail the eligibility expansions which may have increased
SNAP enrollment.

5.1

Unemployment and SNAP (Family Level)

We begin by analyzing the family-level relationship between unemployment
and SNAP receipt using data from the SIPP.30 We estimate the fraction of time
that a family’s labor force participants were unemployed over the past sixteen
months, using data from mid-2007 and mid-2011. The top panel of Figure 6
shows that the frequency of prolonged unemployment spells rose substantially.
Next, we compute the probability of SNAP receipt for families by time spent
unemployed. The bottom panel of Figure 6 shows that the probability of SNAP
receipt in 2007 is rising sharply by unemployment status, from 5% of people
in families with no unemployment to about 60% of people in families with
which were found to be ineligible for SNAP.
28
Relatedly, Anderson et al. (2012) show that the share of working-age SNAP recipients
also receiving unemployment insurance rose during the recession.
29
See also page 283 where he calculates that the BBCE and other eligibility changes are
responsible for “66 percent of the growth of SNAP household participation in excess of family
(125 percent) poverty growth between fiscal years 2007 and 2010.”
30
See Appendix A.1 for details on sample construction. This sample includes all families,
regardless of whether children are present.

20

unemployment for sixteen consecutive months. The same strong correlation
between duration and SNAP receipt exists in 2011, although the probability
of SNAP receipt is higher in this later year for families with short durations.
Using 2007 SNAP receipt rates by duration and the 2011 SIPP distribution of
unemployment durations, we calculate a counterfactual SNAP enrollment rate
in 2011 of 12.0%. National SNAP receipt rose from 8.9% to 14.5% during the
analysis period, so using family-level variation in unemployment rates alone,
we can explain about half the increase in SNAP receipt among the entire US
population (not conditional on unemployment).
When a recession hits an entire region, it becomes more diﬃcult to turn
to neighbors, family, and friends for financial support. An extensive literature in economics (e.g. Townsend (1994)) documents that people rely on local
networks to smooth idiosyncratic shocks, suggesting that the impacts of unemployment on SNAP enrollment for a region will be larger than the impacts on
a family alone. In addition, during the recession, economic distress could occur without measured unemployment, if a worker remained employed but had
his or her hours or wage-level reduced. Indeed, we calculate using the SIPP
that 31 percent of the aggregate increase in SNAP receipt from 2007 to 2011
occurs in families in which no member experienced an unemployment spell
and at least one member was in the labor force. These considerations suggest
benefits to analyzing the relationship between economic conditions and SNAP
receipt at the local level.

5.2

Unemployment and SNAP (Area Level)

We estimate the relationship between local unemployment and SNAP receipt using data from 1990 through 2007, prior to the Great Recession.31 While
unemployment rates were lower during this period, three states (California,
West Virginia, and Michigan) had unemployment rates which exceeded 9%
31

An extensive literature analyzes the eﬀect of SNAP policies and labor market conditions
on enrollment at the state level. Examples include Currie and Grogger (2001); Klerman and
Danielson (2011); Mabli et al. (2009); Mabli and Ferrerosa (2010); Ratcliﬀe et al. (2008);
Ziliak et al. (2003).

21

in the early 1990’s recession. As an initial graphical example, we model the
state-level relationship between unemployment and SNAP enrollment as
(7)

log SN APjt = α + β0 Ujt + ηj + ϕt + εjt

where Ujt is the unemployment rate in state j in year t, ηj is a state fixed eﬀect
and ϕt is a year fixed eﬀect. We plot the results from this regression in the top
panel of Figure 7 – a one percentage point increase in the state unemployment
rate raises SNAP enrollment by six percent.32
Next, we build an extended version of this model using county-level data.33
We use a specification with both county- and state-level unemployment, because county-level unemployment is measured with substantial error, and
state-level unemployment may not reflect important aspects of the local labor
market situation. Our empirical model uses unemployment and two annual
lags at the state and county-level:34

The results are reported in Table 3. In our first specification, we weight each
county equally, and we find that the eﬀect of the contemporaneous state-level
unemployment rate, β̂0 , is large and significant (column 1). γ̂0 and γ̂1 are also
positive and significant. The sum of all β̂ and γ̂ estimates is 0.11, meaning
that in a state in which every county saw a persistent one percentage point
32

Mabli and Ferrerosa (2010) similarly estimate that a 1 p.p. increase in unemployment
raises SNAP enrollment by 6%.
33
Details on construction of this sample are in Appendix A.2. This dataset has two key
limitations. First, not all states report county-level enrollment statistics to FNS. In 1990,
we have county-level data for 85% of SNAP enrollment, and by 2007, after some states have
stopped reporting, we have county-level data for 80% of SNAP enrollment. Second, among
the matched observations, there is measurement error in the county-level unemployment
rate, as well as measurement error because enrollment at a county’s SNAP oﬃce may not
correspond to enrollment by county residents.
34
We found that a third lag was statistically insignificant.

22

increase in the unemployment rate, the model predicts an increase in SNAP
enrollment reaching 11% after three years. When we weight each county by its
population, the eﬀect of unemployment is even larger (column 2), producing
a 20% cumulative increase in enrollment.35
One striking feature of these estimates is that unemployment has highly
persistent impacts on SNAP enrollment.36 In the bottom panel of Figure 7,
we compute the impact of a 1 percentage point increase in unemployment for
three years on SNAP enrollment over a five-year horizon. Some commentators
(Furchtgott-Roth (2012)) have raised concerns that SNAP receipt remained
high even after the unemployment rate peaked in June 2009. In fact, our
estimates show that a feature of the aftermath of past recessions is persistentlyelevated SNAP receipt.
We show robustness checks to our specification in Appendix Table 3. First,
we report estimates from a specification without year fixed eﬀects ϕt (columns
1 and 2). Unsurprisingly, when the national unemployment rate is higher,
SNAP enrollment rises as well, and so this specification yields larger coefficients. This may reflect spillovers in the impacts of unemployment across
geographies or changes in the national policy climate with respect to SNAP
enrollment. Second, we use the share of the population receiving SNAP as
the dependent variable (columns 3 and 4) and find similar magnitudes to the
results in Table 3.
Measurement error seems to be a serious issue with the county unemployment data. Suppose that the true relationship between u and log SN AP
is E ∗ (log SN AP |u) = βu, where u is the true county-level unemployment
35

We emphasize that these specifications do not identify the causal impact of unemployment on SNAP receipt. An increase in the unemployment rate may change local SNAP
policies – an increase in client to caseworker ratios may lengthen processing time, making it
harder to enroll, or governments may enact policies making it easier to enroll. Rather, these
specifications characterize the historical relationship between unemployment and SNAP enrollment, to help us examine whether the path of SNAP enrollment in the Great Recession
is in line with historical patterns.
36
Ziliak et al. (2003) also find a persistent impact of unemployment on SNAP enrollment.

23

rate. If in the data we observe ûcounty = u + ε̃ where u and ε̃ are both normally distributed, and we estimate E ∗ (log SN AP |û) = β̂ û, we will find that
V ar(u)
β̂ = β V ar(u)+V
. This means that β̂ will be biased toward zero. Intuitively,
ar(ε̃)
when the unemployment rate is diﬃcult to measure, it will be harder to detect
statistically a relationship between unemployment and SNAP receipt. To the
extent that measurement error is an issue, regardless of the error distribution,
lowering V ar(ε̃) will raise β̂. Two pieces of evidence suggest a role for measurement error. First, measurement error is likely to be larger for counties
with small populations and weighting each county by its population leads to
larger point estimates. Second, if we knew the true county-level unemployment rate u, and there were no spillover eﬀects from nearby counties, then the
coeﬃcients on state-level unemployment should be zero. In fact, we find that
they tend to be even larger than the county coeﬃcients.37
We use the pre-recession model to predict the consequences of unemployment changes for SNAP enrollment in the Great Recession. We predict the
annual change in enrollment in each county using the equation
∆ log snapijt =

2
�

β̂k ∆uj,t−k + γ̂k ∆uij,t−k

(9)

k=0

where ∆uj,t−k is the change from the previous year in state unemployment
and ∆uij,t−k is the county-level change.38 To predict the change in national
37
Because these coeﬃcients are both biased towards zero due to measurement error, they
likely imply that SNAP receipt has risen less in the Great Recession than we might expect
due to changes in the unemployment rate. If the county-level unemployment data were simply smaller samples of the state data, we could assess the extent of bias from measurement
error and adjust for it. The actual data generating process for the county unemployment
rates is more complicated, and involves allocating the state-wide unemployment across counties based upon county-level administrative data counts of unemployment beneficiaries. A
fuller analysis of measurement error – both in mismatch between unemployment and SNAP
geographies and also in the construction of county-level unemployment rates – is beyond
the scope of this paper, but would be valuable for future work.
38
While measurement error in local unemployment is a source of bias for estimating β̂ and
γ̂, it will not bias our prediction for the path of unemployment in the recession given a set of
�2
coeﬃcients β̂ and γ̂. Formally, ∆ log�
snapijt = E( k=0 β̂k (∆uj,t−k +εj,t−k )+ γ̂k (∆uij,t−k +

(10)

We compute this prediction for all counties, regardless of whether data was
available on SNAP enrollment there.39
Using the coeﬃcients from the specification which weighted counties by
population, we predict that SNAP enrollment would have risen by 18.7 million
people by July 2011 (98% of the observed increase). Using the equal-weighted
specification, we predict an increase of 13.5 million (71% of the observed increase).40
These estimates should be treated with caution. A sharp, sustained increase in unemployment rates may have diﬀerent eﬀects on SNAP enrollment
than a smaller, more-transitory increase. With this caveat, the model’s predicted timing and magnitude of the SNAP enrollment response are quite similar to the observed data. These estimates are consistent with interpreting
the increase in SNAP enrollment as an automatic stabilizer responding to a
very bad labor market situation in a way that is similar to how SNAP has
performed in past downturns.

5.3

Eligibility Expansions

Next, we examine the role of policies which expanded SNAP eligibility in
the recession. We focus in particular on two policies: increased state-level
39

We also computed a prediction
� for the change in national enrollment weighting each
county by its SNAP enrollment ( ij snapij,2007 (log snapijt − log snapij,2007 )) and obtained
very similar results.
40
For July 2012, the population-weighted model predicts 92% of the observed increase,
and the equal-weighted model predicts 54% of the observed increase. The prediction from
the equal-weighted model shrinks more, because that model puts more weight on the second
lag of unemployment and less weight on the third lag, and unemployment is falling during
2012.

25

adoption of Broad-Based Categorical Eligibility (BBCE) and waivers on time
limits for Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWDs) that states
become eligible for when unemployment rates are high. These results for
enrollment are summarized in Table 4. We repeat the exercise for benefits,
and the results are shown in Appendix Table 4.
BBCE, a policy option introduced in 2001 which allows states to relax
income and asset limits on eligibility, is described in detail in Section 4. In
2007, according to the SNAP Policy Database, 13 states had adopted some
version of BBCE. USDA administrators issued a memo in September 2009
(Shahin (2009)) encouraging states to start using BBCE, and by 2011, 41
states had adopted BBCE. Using the QC files, we estimate that in 2011, 1.7
million people (3.9% of total enrollment) lived in households whose income was
too high to be SNAP-eligible under normal program rules and therefore were
enrolled only because of BBCE.41 We construct a counterfactual by assuming
that enrollment for people with excess income would have grown at the same
rate between 2007 and 2011 as enrollment of people eligible under standard
rules. Under this assumption, new adoption of BBCE raised enrollment of
people with excess income by 1.0 million. In other words, we estimate that
of the 1.7 million indivdiuals eligible because of BBCE in 2011, 700,000 were
eligible based on pre-2007 state adoption of BBCE and 1,000,000 were eligible
because of recession-era adoption.42
BBCE also allowed states to raise or eliminate asset limits. Because caseworkers do not record assets in BBCE states, we cannot count enrollment with
excess assets using the QC files. In 2011, Idaho and Michigan reinstated asset
limits of $5,000 and caseloads fell by 1 percent or less (Government Account41

Precisely, we classify a household as exceeding standard income limits due to BBCE
if (1) they are not receiving pure cash assistance (because they are already categorically
eligible) and (2) they have net income > 100% of poverty. We also flag households with
gross income > 130% of poverty if they do not have a senior or a disabled person. Our
estimates are very similar to those reported by Government Accountability Oﬃce (2012)
(Table 2) and Trippe and Gillooly (2010) (Table C4.2).
42
Using the same methodology, we calculate that recession-era BBCE adoption raised
benefit expenditures on people with excess income by $200 million in 2011.

26

ability Oﬃce (2012)). Based on this evidence, we estimate that adoption of
BBCE during the recession raised enrollment of people with excess assets by
560,000.43
Welfare reform (PRWORA) subjected ABAWDs who are working less than
half time or not meeting employment-training requirements to a 3-month time
limit on SNAP benefits during any 36-month period. However, the legislation
established a waiver of time limits in places with elevated unemployment.44
Without time limits, more people are eligible, and there is greater incentive
to apply, given the potential for a longer duration of receipt. Conceptually,
because state eligiblity for ABAWD waivers mechanically expands and shrinks
with the unemployment rate, these waivers have a lot in common with conventional automatic stabilizers, even though they require a state decision to
apply for the waivers for them to go into eﬀect.45
In 2007, about one-third of the SNAP enrollment was in places with a
waiver. As the country headed into recession, nearly all places became eligible
for waivers.46 In 2011, we estimate that 4.3 million SNAP recipients (9.5% of
43

Idaho and Michigan reinstated asset limits of $5,000, which included some people who
would have been excluded by a $2,000 asset limit. Using the Survey of Consumer Finances,
we estimate that asset limits of $2,000 would have caused caseloads to fall twice as much as
a $5,000 limit. Based on this fact, we assume that people with excess assets account for 2%
of the total caseload in BBCE states. In 2007, the 11 states without asset tests accounted
for 18% of SNAP enrollment and in 2011, the 39 states without asset tests in 2011 accounted
for 79% of total SNAP enrollment. We calculate the total number of individuals aﬀected as
.02 x (.79-.18) x 45 million. This could be an overestimate if the true impact of the Idaho
and Michigan policy changes analyzed by the GAO was less than 1 percent rather than
equal to 1 percent. Because we lack micro data on these asset limit changes, in constructing
an annual pattern of the impact of these changes for Figure 8 we assume that enrollment
for cases with excess assets grew linearly from 2007 to 2011.
44
A “place” may be a city, a county, or a group of counties. Commonly used criteria are
if a place has an unemployment rate is 20 percent higher than the national average, has
unemployment above 10%, is designated by the Department of Labor as a “Labor Surplus
Area”, or has a “low and declining employment-population ratio.”
45
Some portion of the coeﬃcients estimated using equation 8 likely reflects the business
cycle pattern of ABAWD waivers because about half of our 1990 to 2007 sample period is
after the new waiver procedures were set up.
46
USDA administrators issued a memo on January 8, 2009 (Foley (2009)) saying that
states with Extended Unemployment Compensation for unemployment insurance were al-

27

total enrollment) were potential ABAWDs using the QC files.47 If enrollment
for this group had instead grown at the same rate as enrollment of people eligible under standard rules, there would be about 2.5 million potential ABAWDs
receiving SNAP. Under this assumption, the recession-induced waivers raised
enrollment by 1.9 million people.48
We find that the impact of BBCE adoption and ABAWD waivers was
smaller in terms of benefit dollars than in terms of enrollment. Real spending
in 2011 dollars rose from $31.9 billion in 2007 to $71.9 billion in 2011, an
increase of $40.0 billion. BBCE adoption raised spending by $1.1 billion,
accounting for 3% of the increase, and ABAWD waivers raised spending by
$3.6 billion, accounting for 9% of the increase. Put another way, total SNAP
spending increased by 6% as a result of these policy changes.
Finally, the Recovery Act temporarily raised the maximum SNAP benefit
by 13.6%, which increased the incentive to enroll and may have raised takeup among the already eligible. It is diﬃcult to quantify the impact of this
change because SNAP benefits are set at the federal level. However, a series of
papers estimating the take-up elasticity for unemployment insurance, another
program which serves people with temporary economic need, finds values between 0.19 and 0.59.49 Applying this range to the 18% increase in average
lowed to waive ABAWD time limits. Nearly all states had EUC during the recession, which
qualified them for an ABAWD waiver. Then, the Recovery Act issued a national waiver of
time limits through FY2010. After this authority expired, nearly all states received waivers
in FY2011 due to continued labor market weakness.
47
We classify a person as a potential ABAWD if they are: ages 18-49, have no children in
the household, are working less than 30 hours a week, and are not disabled. Following Leftin
et al. (2012), we define a person disabled if (1) they have SSI income, (2) the household has no
elderly members and a medical deduction, or (3) the person is exempt from work registration
due to disability, and has income from Social Security, veterans’ benefits, or workers’ comp.
We classify these people as “potential” ABAWDs because many had enrolled within the
previous three months, and likely had not exhausted their time limits. For example, 29% of
potential ABAWDs in FY2011 had enrolled within the last three months.
48
Using the same methodology, we calculate that recession-induced waivers raised benefit
expenditures by $3.6 billion in 2011.
49
McCall (1995) uses the CPS Displaced Worker Survey to estimate a that a 10% increase
in UI benefits raises benefit expenditure through takeup by 1.9%-3.0%. Anderson and Meyer
(1997) use administrative data from six state UI programs to estimate an elasticity between

28

household SNAP benefits implies an increase in enrollment of 3% to 11%.

Summary and Reconciliation with Literature

Figure 8 summarizes our enrollment results for unemployment and eligibility expansions together. We find that expanded adoption of BBCE raised
enrollment by 1.57 million people, and automatic waivers of time limits raised
enrollment by 1.87 million people, for a total of 3.44 million. Together, these
two changes can account for 18% of the total increase in enrollment over this
period. Beyond that, unemployment raises SNAP receipt both by increasing
the number of people who are eligible and increasing need among eligibles.50
Recall that we estimated two diﬀerent specifications for the impact of unemployment on SNAP enrollment – one which weighted each county equally and
another which weighted counties according to population. The equal-weighted
estimate is shown in the top panel, and here our model slightly underpredicts
the actual increase in SNAP enrollment. The population-weighted estimate,
in the bottom panel, slightly overpredicts the actual values in 2010 and 2011.
A simple decomposition suggests that for the other 15.7 million people who
enrolled in SNAP about one-third is attributable to increases in the number of
eligible individuals, holding program rules fixed, and two-thirds is attributable
to increases in the take-up rate.51
SNAP enrollment rose by 19.1 million people from July 2007 to July 2011,
an unprecedented increase, but one that the estimates from our unemployment
regressions indicate was mostly the result of the program’s built-in automatic
stabilizer features operating as usual in the midst of a very severe recession.
Mulligan (2012) estimates that post-2007 policy changes increased SNAP
0.39 and 0.59.
50
We believe that our model is conservative in only focusing on the unemployment rate.
In particular, other household economic measures suggest that the Great Recession was a
time of very serious economic need. Long-term unemployment and food insecurity reached
all-time highs.
51
The number of people living below 125% of the poverty line increased by a factor of
1.2, while the number of people enrolled in SNAP, after subtracting 3.3 million for reasons
detailed above, increased by a factor of 1.58.

29

enrollment by 20.3 percent. Our comparable number is that these changes
account for 7.5 percent of enrollment in 2011.
Mulligan (pages 79-81) assumes that adoption of relaxed vehicle policies
during the recession and changes in asset policies in the 2008 Farm Bill raised
participation by 12%.52 However, the SNAP Policy Database shows that by
2007, 46 states had already adopted relaxed vehicle policies (see Table 2). The
2008 Farm Bill excluded retirement accounts and 529s from the asset test; this
had a minimal impact on eligibility, given that asset limits bind so rarely, as
discussed above.
Mulligan further assumes that BBCE raised enrollment nationally by an
additional 6%, which is larger than our estimate of 3.5%. His estimate comes
from comparing the diﬀerential increase in SNAP enrollment among states that
had adopted BBCE by 2010 relative to the ones that had not. However, if state
economic conditions aﬀect the decision to adopt BBCE, then this estimate
will conflate the impact of those conditions with the impact of the eligiblity
expansion. States with BBCE by 2010 had unemployment rates averaging
9.2%, while the unemployment rate in non-BBCE states averaged 7.6%. Thus,
it seems quite possible that part of the diﬀerential SNAP enrollment by BBCE
states was a reflection of their greater economic distress. In contrast, our
estimates directly count the number of individuals who were eligible under the
eligiblity expansions but would not have been eligible in their absence.
Finally, in assessing the impact of waiving ABAWD time limits, Mulligan
does a QC-based calculation that is quite similar to ours. He concludes that
the waiver of time limits raised enrollment by 2.3%, which is smaller than
52

Mulligan cites Ratcliﬀe et al. (2007) as finding that exempting a vehicle from the asset
test raises participation by 8-16%, and takes the midpoint of 12% as his estimate (see
Ratcliﬀe et al. (2008) for the published version). Ratcliﬀe et al. (2007) uses SIPP data in
its analysis. Another paper using the SIPP, Hanratty (2006), reports that exempting one
vehicle changed enrollment by negative 5.5% to positive 7%. Estimates for the impact of
vehicle exemptions using state-level administrative enrollment counts are: 0.8%-1.2% from
Mabli et al. (2009) and 0.4%-0.9% from Klerman and Danielson (2011). In Appendix Table
2, we estimate with state-level data that exempting at least one vehicle raises enrollment by
2%.

30

our estimate of 4.1%. In Table 5, we provide a side-by-side comparison of our
estimates and Mulligan’s which summarizes the discussion in this section.

Conclusion

In this paper, we examine changes in SNAP enrollment over the past twenty
years. We show that a strong economy and welfare reform contributed to
falling enrollment in the 1990’s, and policy eﬀorts to make the program more
accessible to workers and a bounceback from welfare reform caused enrollment
to rise between 2001 and 2007. Research on SNAP enrollment in the Great
Recession has been limited, and we attempt to fill this gap. We find that SNAP
acts as a automatic stabilizer: unemployment and temporary business-cycle
sensitive rule changes for adults without children were much more important
than state-level policy expansions in producing the surge in enrollment from
2007 to 2011.

Notes: Eslami et al. (2012) of Mathematica Policy Research estimate the takeup rate as average monthly SNAP enrollment using administrative data, divided by
the number of people estimated to be eligible using data on annual income from
the March CPS, combined with adjustment procedures for a variety of program
requirements including legal residency, asset tests, and work requirements.
Because of changes over time in its methodology for estimating the take-up rate,
Mathematica does not publish a consistent time series for take-up. In order to
produce a consistent series, we splice together the 1993 and 1994 estimates. Under the old methodology, the take-up rate was 61.4% in 1994 and under the new
methodology, it was 74.8%. For estimates prior to 1994, we compute T aket =
method + 74.8 − 61.4. Mathematica changed its methodology in 2010, but
T akeold
t
provided a time-consistent estimate in Figure 1 of Eslami et al. (2012). No estimate
is available yet for 2011. A crude way to estimate the 2011 take-up rate is to calculate the ratio of enrollment to the number of people with income less than 125% of
poverty in calendar year t, which is 66.4% in 2010 and 73.3% in 2011. We estimate
T ake2011 = T ake2010 + (73.3 − 66.4). Finally, Mathematica changed its methodology
in 1999 and 2002, but those changes aﬀected the estimated take-up rate by no more
than half a percentage point, and we make no adjustment.

Notes: tpeak is the year in which a state had its maximum number of cash
assistance recipients. For 41 states, this peak occurred between 1992 and 1994. The
x-axis in both panels is the change in the number of welfare recipients (expressed
in logs) from tpeak to tpeak + 5. Idaho is an outlier and is omitted; there, welfare
receipt fell by 234 log points (from 24,282 recipients in 1995 to 2,397 in 2000), and
SNAP receipt fell by 35 log points. The y-axis is the change in the number of SNAP
recipients (expressed in logs) in families with children, from the QC files.

Notes: Each bar is a coeﬃcient from a separate regression with a single policy
indicator, plus state and year fixed eﬀects. The summary index is the sum of all
eight policy indicators divided by 8. Sample is 50 states plus DC annually from 1996
through 2010. Impacts are shown relative to sample mean for take-up rate (65.3%)
and the percent of the population receiving SNAP (9.0%). Policy data comes from
each year’s July record in SNAP Policy Database. Take-up rate is the average of
all values reported in State Participation Reports (Cunnyngham et al. (2013) is the
most recent report). SNAP enrollment is for July. States are weighted equally.
Standard errors are clustered by state. Appendix Table 2 shows the coeﬃcients and

the share of the US population in families with diﬀerent amounts of time spent unemployed. Always-employed families are 63% of the population in 2007 and 54% in
2011. Families with no labor force participation are 14% in both 2007 and 2011. See

Notes: The first panel shows the relationship between state unemployment and
SNAP enrollment from 1990 to 2007 using the regression log SN APjt = α + βUjt +
ηj + ϕt + εjt . We create 20 bins for residual values of Ujt and compute conditional
means within each bin for SNAP enrollment. Standard errors are clustered by state.
We estimate the impact of unemployment on SNAP enrollment using annual
county and state data from 1990 to 2007. Results shown are for model which weights
counties by population (Table 3, column 2). 95% confidence interval in gray is
computed using the delta method.

Notes: This figure combines the estimates for the impact of the unemployment
rate on SNAP enrollment from Table 3 with the estimates for the impact of eligiblity
expansions from Table 4. Table 3 presents two diﬀerent specifications for the impact
of unempoyment on SNAP receipt. The top panel shows results using the specification where each county is equally weighted and the bottom panel using population
weights (see Section 5.2 for details). Many states adopted relaxed income and asset thresholds during the recession (“BBCE”) and elevated unemployment triggered
waivers of time limits for Able Bodied Adults Without Dependents, also known as
“ABAWDs” (see Section 5.3 for details). The estimated contribution of these policy
changes to overall change in enrollment are the same in the top and bottom panel.

Note: We use the March Current Population Survey (CPS) together with the SNAP
Quality Control (QC) files to study SNAP enrollment by single mothers with children from
1993 through 1999. We develop a unique decomposition of enrollment changes by income
eligibility, and among eligibles, by take-up rates separately for families working and families
receiving cash assistance.
Eligibility Data We estimate the number of eligible people as those in families with income
less than 130% of poverty in the CPS. We define a family as working it has earned income of
at least 25% of the poverty line and as receiving cash assistance if it reports payments of at
least 10% of the poverty line. We then sub-divide the likely-eligible sample into four groups:
’Work Only’, ’Cash Assistance Only’, ’Work and Cash’, or ’Neither Work Nor Cash’.
SNAP Enrollment Data We estimate the number of people enrolled in each of these four
groups using QC data, and separately using CPS data. The QC data come from administrative sources, but use a monthly accounting concept. The CPS data on SNAP receipt cover
the prior year, but suﬀer from underreporting. Appendix Table 1 reports take-up estimates
for each of these four subgroups using both methods.

Note: Enrollment counts are average monthly caseload for Q3 in QC files. Both ABAWD
waivers and state BBCE adoption expanded from 2007 to 2011. We calculate a no-eligibilitychange counterfactual by assuming that enrollment for these groups grew at the same rate
as enrollment for people eligible under standard rules.
Relaxed Income and Asset Limits through Broad-Based Categorical Eligibility (BBCE). In
2007, 13 states had adopted some version of BBCE, and by 2011, 41 states had BBCE.
Using the QC files, we estimate the number of households as which are eligible only due to
relaxed income limits. See text for details. The QC files lack data to adequately evaluate
assets. Idaho and Michigan re-introduced asset limits of $5,000 in 2011, and about 1% of
cases were closed due to excess assets (GAO 2012). Using the Survey of Consumer Finances,
we estimate that asset limits of $2,000 would have caused caseloads to fall by 2%. In 2007,
the 11 states without asset tests accounted for 18% of SNAP enrollment and in 2011, the
39 states without asset tests in 2011 accounted for 79% of total SNAP enrollment.
Waiver of Time Limits for Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents (ABAWDs)
Under
standard program rules, there is a 3-month time limit on SNAP receipt for ABAWDs who
are not working full time and not participating in an employment training program. See
text for details.

Note: This table provides estimates for the total increase in SNAP enrollment due to

no impact from relaxed vehicle rules during the Great Recession because, as shown in Table

enrollment impacts come from Table 4. See Section 5.4 for details.

Data Appendix
Survey of Income and Program Participation

We use the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to analyze familylevel unemployment and SNAP receipt in 2007 and 2011. The unit of observation is
always a person, with cross-sectional person weights (wpfinwgt). We observe enrollment in cash assistance and SNAP at the individual level. We assign all individuals
in the same family the same status for potential SNAP eligibility (family income <
130% of poverty), unemployment, and family earnings.

A.1.1

Family-Level Data on Unemployment and SNAP

We use waves 8-11 of the 2004 SIPP and waves 6-9 of the 2008 SIPP. We use family
definitions which include subfamilies as part of the same unit (rfid) from month 4
of the final wave of the analysis sample.
Unemployment We construct a person-level measure of unemployment over the
previous four waves. The SIPP records weekly labor force status for people age 15
or higher. Of people in this age group in wave 11 of the 2004 panel and wave 9 of
the 2008 SIPP, a complete retrospective sixteen-month history is available for about
81% of people. We compute an individual’s unemployment status using all available
months, including those individuals for whom data on some months is missing. We
compute the unemployment rate as the number of weeks unemployed (rmwklkg), divided by the number of weeks the person was in the labor force (rmwklkg+rmwkwjb).
We aggregate this measure to the family level by taking a simple average of unemployment rates across family members.
SNAP Receipt We use self-reported SNAP receipt rcutyp27 (ignoring observations where SNAP receipt is allocated, a27amt) from the fourth reference month,
which is the month preceding the interview. Meyer et al. (2009) document underreporting of transfer program receipt in household surveys. In wave 11 of the 2004
SIPP, which covers SNAP receipt from July to October 2007, 6.3% of people report
receiving SNAP, while administrative data show that the average monthly caseload
was 8.9%. In wave 9 of the 2008 SIPP, which covers SNAP receipt from April to July
2011, 9.8% of people report receiving SNAP, while administrative data show that the
average monthly caseload was 14.5%. Meyer and Goerge (2011) link administrative
data on SNAP receipt to the ACS and CPS. They find that the false negative rate
(report no SNAP receipt in survey when admin records do show SNAP receipt) is
much higher than the the false positive rate.
Formally, we want to know the relationship between unemployment duration U
and SNAP receipt. If there are only false negatives, then P r(ReportSN AP |ReceiveSN AP ) =
71% in 2007 and 68% in 2011. To match administrative totals, we recode each personlevel indicator of SNAP receipt to 1.41 in the 2007 sample and 1.48 in the 2011 sample. Formally, such a modification is equivalent to assuming P r(ReportSN AP |ReceiveSN AP, U )

48

is equal for all U . Intuitively, it says that peope with long unemployment durations
are as likely to underreport SNAP receipt as people with short unemployment durations. Meyer and Goerge (2011) estimate the relationship between unemployment
status and the false negative rate (report no SNAP receipt when admin records
do show SNAP receipt) in the CPS and ACS. In three out of four specifications
they find no statistically significant relationship. In the fourth, they find that the
false negative rate is higher for people who are unemployed; if this is true, then
our method understates the strength of the relationship between unemployment and
SNAP receipt.

A.2

Area-Level Data on Unemployment and SNAP

We link data from the Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) series published
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to administrative data on SNAP enrollment from
the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) at USDA.
SNAP Enrollment State SNAP oﬃces report monthly enrollment to FNS at the
project level each January and July. We use the July data from the fifty states plus
DC. States have discretion over the geographic definition of “project.” Many states
report enrollment at each SNAP oﬃce with a 7-digit id of which the first 5 digits
are a county FIPS code. We collapse the data to the county level using 5-digit FIPS
codes. AK, CT, ME, MA, NH, OR, RI, UT, VT, WV, and WY never report countylevel enrollment. NY and ID stop reporting county-level enrollment in January 1992.
We drop all these states from the sample. Missouri stops county-level reporting in
2007, Nebraska stops in 1994, and Montana stops in 2002; for these states, we use
county data in the years it is available.
We drop tribal geographies in Minnesota and Arizona. We drop 12 county-year
pairs where enrollment exceeds county population, and another 16 county-year pairs
where enrollment jumps to at least 40% of the population for one year and then
immediately falls again.
In 1990, we have county-level data for 85% of SNAP enrollment in our cleaned
sample, and by 2007, after some states have stopped reporting, we have county-level
data for 80% of SNAP enrollment.
Unemployment LAUS estimates monthly state-level and county-level unemployment rates. The state-level estimates are controlled to match results from the Current Population Survey (CPS). Because the CPS samples relatively few households
per state (from about 800 per month in Mississippi to about 4,300 per month
in California), and the unemployment rate typically varies from around 5% to
10%, it is quite diﬃcult to precisely estimate state unemployment rates, especially in small states. LAUS then uses administrative data on the place of residence of unemployment insurance recipients to allocate the CPS-based state unemployment estimates county-by-county. See http://www.bls.gov/lau/laumthd.htm
for details on estimation methodology. We use flat files from 1990-2012 posted

49

at ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/time.series/la/. For about 500 county geographies labeled
with series_id “PA” or “PS”, LAUS reports a geographic identifier which is not a
valid 5-digit county FIPS code. We use data from http://www.bls.gov/lau/laucnty12.xls
to crosswalk these LAUS geographies to county FIPS codes. We observe July SNAP
enrollment in year t, and we construct annual unemployment in year t using data
from the preceding 12 months (the average unemployment rate from July in year
t − 1 to June in year t).
Population We use annual population estimates from the Census Bureau posted
at http://www.census.gov/support/USACdataDownloads.html
Merged County Data We merge the county-level datasets using year and 5-digit
FIPS codes. Every observation in the unemployment dataset also appears in the
population dataset. There are 7 fips codes from FNS that do not match the county
unemployment file; they account for 0.01% of enrollment. We have 47,940 observations between 1990 and 2007 with nonmissing, positive SNAP enrollment and a
county-level estimate of the unemployment rate. Our analysis sample has 42,169
observations, because we require two lags of the local unemployment rate.

take-up rates, and by take-up rates separately for families working and families receiving
cash assistance.
Eligibility Data We estimate the number of eligible people as those in families with income
less than 130% of poverty in the CPS. We define a family as working if it has earned income
of at least 25% of the poverty line and as receiving cash assistance if it reports payments
of at least 10% of the poverty line. We then sub-divide the likely-eligible sample into four
groups: ’Work Only’, ’Cash Assistance Only’, ’Work and Cash’, or ’Neither Work Nor Cash’.
