Parenting with Style: Altruism and Paternalism in Intergenerational Preference Transmission
Matthias Doepke and Fabrizio Zilibotti
NBER Working Paper No. 20214
June 2014, Revised February 2017
JEL No. D10,J10,O10,O40
ABSTRACT
We develop a theory of parent-child relations that rationalizes the choice between alternative
parenting styles (as set out in Baumrind 1967). Parents maximize an objective function that
combines Beckerian altruism and paternalism towards children. They can affect their children’s
choices via two channels: either by influencing children’s preferences or by imposing direct
restrictions on their choice sets. Different parenting styles (authoritarian, authoritative, and
permissive) emerge as equilibrium outcomes and are affected both by parental preferences and by
the socioeconomic environment. Parenting style, in turn, feeds back into the children’s welfare
and economic success. The theory is consistent with the decline of authoritarian parenting
observed in industrialized countries and with the greater prevalence of more permissive parenting
in countries characterized by low inequality.

1 Introduction
From time immemorial, parents have been looking for advice on how to best raise their
children. The Bible urges parents to be strict and to dispense generous corporal punishment.1 Discipline and rigor are also advocated by John Locke in Some Thoughts
Concerning Education.2 In his celebrated Émile, Jean-Jacques Rousseau reverses the
perspective and encourages parents to let children learn from experience and not to interfere with their freedom and happiness.3 The pendulum has kept swinging between
strict and lenient approaches ever since. If anti-authoritarian parenting and schooling
practices became fashionable in the 1960s and the 1970s, the “Tiger Mom” has recently
become the icon of a strict, rule-oriented parenting which is supposedly at the root of
the success of many Asian children (see Chua 2011).
What drives these shifts in the doctrine and practice of child upbringing? In this article,
we argue that child-rearing practices are shaped by economic incentives and constraints.
We build a positive theory of parenting that accounts for broad changes in parenting
styles in industrialized countries over time, and for variation in parenting styles across
countries.
In our model, parents are driven by a combination of Beckerian altruism (i.e., a concern for the well-being of the child) and a paternalistic motive. Paternalism captures
the extent to which parents disagree with their children’s natural preferences and inclinations. Parents can affect their children’s choices in two ways: either by molding
children’s preferences, or by imposing direct constraints on their choices. Echoing the
classification of “parenting styles” in developmental psychology (see Baumrind 1967),
we define as permissive a parenting style that allows children to make free choices according to their natural inclinations, in the spirit of Rousseau. We define as authoritative
a parenting style where parents attempt to mold their children’s preferences, with the
aim of inducing choices that parents view as conducive to success in life. Finally, we
define as authoritarian a style where parents restrict children’s choices, i.e., the parent
directly imposes her will on the child rather than taking the indirect route of molding the

13:24); “Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of discipline will drive it far from him”

child’s preferences. The choice between these parenting styles hinges on the interaction
between parental preferences and the characteristics of the socioeconomic environment.
Our theory can be applied to different aspects of potential disagreement between parents and children. We conjecture that disagreements about choices that have a bearing on human-capital investment and future economic success are a key factor for the
choice of parenting styles and for the observed variation in the data. Accordingly, we
focus on two preference traits that have been shown to be important for human capital
and wealth accumulation (see, e.g., Doepke and Zilibotti 2008 and Dohmen et al. 2015),
namely, time preference (patience) and risk aversion. In the case of patience, we identify
paternalism as the innate tendency of parents to care more about their children’s futureoriented investments than do the children themselves, as witnessed by the relentless
struggle of many parents to push their reluctant children to study diligently for school.
In the case of risk aversion, we consider paternalism to be the tendency of parents to
protect children from risky activities that may have long-term costs.
Parents can deal with these conflicts by monitoring their children and forcing them to
obey (authoritarian parenting). The downside of the authoritarian strategy is that it
limits children’s freedom, and this has its own costs in terms of human capital investment. For example, some independence and risk taking may be necessary for children
to discover their true talents. Alternatively, parents can mold children’s preferences so
as to align them with their own (authoritative parenting), for instance, by emphasizing
the virtue of hard work or the importance of avoiding certain types of risky behavior
(drugs, unprotected sex, etc.). The downside of authoritative parenting is that it imposes
a welfare cost on children, and may also require costly effort on part of the parents.
Building on these ideas, we can envision societies as being distinguished by the return to
human capital investment and by the comparative advantage of parents in transmitting
skills to their children (or conversely, the economic return to children’s independence).
In traditional societies with a strong incumbency advantage and low social and occupational mobility, children usually do well by adopting their parents’ profession. In such
societies, the returns to independence are low, and hence we would expect authoritarian
parenting to dominate. In contrast, authoritative parenting should prevail in societies
with a high economic value of making independent choices (for example, because of a
high return to matching one’s occupation with one’s talents) and a high return to human
capital. Finally, permissive parenting is attractive if the return to independence is high
and the return to human capital investment is low.
2

The theory is consistent with historical trends in parenting styles in industrialized countries. Authoritarian parenting, as measured by practices such as corporal punishment,
has been declining over time. In the 1960s and 1970s, anti-authoritarian (i.e., permissive) parenting gained in popularity. In recent decades, we observe a new trend towards
more engaged and intrusive parenting. By and large, the nature of this new parenting
style (which is commonly known as “helicopter parenting”) is authoritative and shuns
the coercive methods of yesteryear. Instead, helicopter parents aim to form responsible
children who will “do the right thing” and become high achievers on their own accord.
We argue that the long-term decline in authoritarian parenting is driven by rising economic returns to independence. The continuous increase in the division of labor in industrialized societies has greatly increased the number of occupations, making it less
likely that a child’s talents are well matched with the occupation of the parent. In addition, even within professions the specialized knowledge of the parent may have less
value when there is rapid technological change. These trends have increased parents’
incentives to grant children more independence by letting them acquire general human
capital through formal education. This erodes the direct control over children that is a
precondition for an authoritarian parenting style.
We link the period of anti-authoritarian parenting to low inequality, a low return to
education, and the increasing size of welfare state programs. In the 1960s and early
1970s, economic inequality reached a historic low, and there was little unemployment.
In those days, the returns to pushing children to study hard were low relative to the
value of granting them freedom and independence. For sure, the hippie movement that
is often identified with the trend towards anti-authoritarian parenting also had other
(e.g., political) motives, but our analysis suggests that broad economic trends played an
important role in its success.
Regarding the rise of authoritative parenting in recent decades, our theory suggests that
such a trend could be driven by an increase in the return to education. And indeed, the
decades since the 1980s brought about a reversion in economic trends and an accompanying waning of the hippie values. Inequality has risen, in large part due to an increase
in the returns to education and skill. The theory predicts that such a change should induce a shift towards more intensive parenting aimed at increasing children’s drive for
achievement while protecting them from various forms of juvenile risk that can harm
their future prospects. In other words, the theory accounts for today’s popularity of
helicopter parenting.
3

A general implication of our theory is that permissive parenting is less attractive when
the stakes are high, i.e., when adult-style behavior is especially important for children’s
future success. Thus, we should expect little permissive parenting in unequal societies
where early effort can have a large effect on one’s position later in life. In contrast, in
more equal societies parents should be more inclined to grant children independence
and room for self-discovery. We show that these predictions are in line with evidence on
differences in parenting between countries with low inequality (such as Germany and
the Scandinavian countries) and more unequal countries such as the United States.
In the next section, we relate our contribution to the existing literature. In Section 3,
we present evidence on variation in parenting styles across countries and over time that
motivates our theory. Our general model of parenting styles is introduced in Section 4,
and in Sections 5 and 6 we consider applications emphasizing the role of patience and
risk preferences to address the facts described in Section 3. Section 7 concludes. All
proofs are contained in the mathematical appendix.

2 Related Literature
The concept of parenting style originates from developmental psychology. In her seminal contributions, Baumrind (1967) proposes the threefold classification of parenting
styles into authoritarian, permissive, and authoritative that is still dominant today. Since
then, many studies in psychology have attempted to identify the effects of parenting
style on children’s preferences, personalities, and outcomes (see, e.g., Aunola et al. 2000,
Chan and Koo 2011, Darling and Steinberg 1993, Dornbush et al. 1987, Spera 2005, and
Steinberg et al. 1991).
There exists a limited economic literature on parenting, influenced by the seminal contributions of Becker and Tomes (1979) and Mulligan (1997). Weinberg (2001) focuses
on parents’ influence on their children’s behavior through pecuniary incentives. He argues that, due to the scarcity of means, low-income parents have limited access to such
incentives, and therefore resort to authoritarian methods such as corporal punishment.
Lizzeri and Siniscalchi (2008) consider the decision problem of altruistic parents who
have superior information about the consequences of certain actions. Parents can intervene to protect children from the consequences of ill-informed choices. However, this
comes at the cost of reducing children’s ability to learn from experience. The setting
gives rise to alternative parenting strategies, depending on whether parents aim to shelter their children from the consequences of their actions, or instead wish to maximize
4

learning opportunities. In their model, parents do not have paternalistic motives. Instead, parenting strategies arise from limits on communication: parents are not able to
directly share their knowledge, nor can they directly communicate to children which
action they should take.4 Information frictions are also emphasized in a recent empirical literature (Attanasio 2015, Attanasio et al. 2015, and Dizon-Ross 2016) arguing that
parental investment in child rearing hinges not only on parents’ objectives and resource
constraints, but also on their possibly incorrect beliefs about the nature of the production
function for human capital. These papers are complementary to ours: they postulate, as
we do, that parenting practices are crucial in shaping child development, but focus on a
different source of frictions (imperfect information).
Our paper is related more generally to the large literature on cultural transmission and
norms and the effect of cultural factors on institutions and economic development, including Bisin and Verdier (2001, 2010), Gorodnichenko and Roland (2016), Hauk and
Saez-Marti (2002), Saez-Marti and Zenou (2012), and Tabellini (2008). A common assumption in this literature is imperfect empathy, which corresponds to the paternalistic
element in our theory: parents use their own preferences to evaluate children’s choices.
Imperfectly empathic parents always benefit when children adopt the parents’ cultural
traits. By considering a setting with both altruistic and paternalistic motives, our theory
allows for richer implications and leads to a theory of parenting styles.
Interactions between parental transmission of preferences, labor supply, and occupational choice are also central to the analyses of Corneo and Jeanne (2010), Doepke and
Zilibotti (2008), and Fernández (2013). Becker et al. (2016) show that it may be optimal
for parents to invest resources in manipulating their children’s preferences in order to
“buy” their support in old age. Lundberg et al. (2009) and Romich et al. (2009) focus on
the non-cooperative interaction between paternalistic parents and myopic children. In
our model, authoritative parenting may instill a form of guilt that induces the child to
behave responsibly and avoid choices that parents view as inappropriate. This feature
links our work to Fernández-Villaverde et al. (2014), where altruistic parents choose
how strongly to stigmatize sex, trading off the marginal gains from instilling a taboo
against its costs.
Our theory relates to the recent literature on time-inconsistent decision making and
temptation. Gul and Pesendorfer (2001) propose an axiomatic decision theory of a ratio4

Other recent studies involving a choice of parenting strategies include Cobb-Clark et al. (2016),
Cosconati (2013), and Zhang and Ikeda (2016). None of these papers aim to explain variation in parenting
styles over time and across countries.

nal agent who is subject to a temptation problem where the decision maker may benefit
from restricting her choice set ex ante. In our model, similarly, a parent may find it
optimal to restrict the choice set of the next member of the dynasty. Other related papers in this literature include Amador et al. (2006) and Bhatt and Ogaki (2012). Pavoni
and Yazici (2016) study an optimal taxation problem where the inefficiency in decision
making that arises from time-inconsistent preferences calls for a positive tax on parental
transfers.
Our study is also motivated by a growing literature showing that preferences and noncognitive skills can be molded from early childhood, and that these attributes play
an important role for human and social capital accumulation. Heckman and Mosso
(2014) show that the success of intervention programs targeting poor families with small
children hinges on whether a program stimulates parental investments and improves
parent-child interactions (see also Cunha 2015, Cunha et al. 2010, Heckman et al. 2013,
and Segal 2013). Our analysis builds specifically on work emphasizing the importance
of patience for human capital investment (see, e.g., Figlio et al. 2016, Heckman et al.
2006, Sutter et al. 2013).

3 Motivating Evidence
In this section, we lay out some novel motivating facts that a positive theory of parenting
style ought to explain. We focus on variation in parenting styles across OECD countries,
differential trends in parenting across social classes in the United States from the 1970s
to the present, and the correlation between parenting style and children’s performance
in education.
3.1 Differences in Parenting Styles Across Countries
We start by documenting how the popularity of the three parenting styles varies across
countries that differ in income inequality, return to education, and redistributive policies. Our theory suggests that these variables should be important determinants of parenting choices in advanced economies where the incumbency premium is low. Accordingly, our sample of countries consists of all OECD members before 1994.5 We choose
these countries because they are broadly similar in terms of the overall level of development (which correlates with incumbency premia) and other aspects of culture and
5

The sample includes: Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Japan,
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United States. Although Turkey is a poorer country than the rest of the group, its exclusion yields no changes in the results.

institutions that may also affect parenting choices (e.g., a former communist government).
Our measures of parenting styles are assembled using the World Value Survey (WVS),
where people are asked the following question: “Here is a list of qualities that children
can be encouraged to learn at home. Which, if any, do you consider to be especially
important? Please choose up to five!”6 We construct proxies of the three main parenting styles (authoritarian, authoritative, and permissive) by considering the four child
qualities most directly related to them. The value most closely associated with an authoritarian parenting style is obedience. Therefore, we label as authoritarian any parent
who lists obedience among the desired qualities. Next, we label as authoritative any parent who (i) is not authoritarian, and (ii) mentions hard work among the top five values.
Finally, we label as permissive any parent who (i) is neither authoritarian nor authoritative, and (ii) lists either independence or imagination (or both) among the top five
values. The three categories are mutually exclusive but not exhaustive: some parents
may not be associated with any of the three parenting styles. However, this residual categories turns out to be small. In a total sample of 66,632 respondents, 27% are classified
as authoritarian, 30% are as classified authoritative, 34% are classified as permissive,
and 9% are not classified. In the analysis below, we exclude the non-classified group.7
The focal point of our analysis is the correlation between inequality and the choice of
parenting style. In more unequal societies, success and failure are associated with larger
income gaps; thus, we expect that parents might interfere more with their children’s
natural inclination to seize the day. Our first measure of inequality is the 90th-to-10th
percentile ratio in the gross earnings of full-time dependent employees from the OECD.
This measure is available for many years and is easily comparable across countries.
As a first-step analysis, we collapse the individual data at the country-wave level. The
permissive parenting style is negatively correlated with inequality (correlation coefficient: -0.63), whereas the authoritarian (0.25) and, more pronouncedly, the authoritative
6

The values among which parents can choose are: independence, hard work, feeling of responsibility,
imagination, tolerance and respect for others, thrift and saving money, determination and perseverance,
religious faith, unselfishness, and obedience. We consider data from all the available waves: 1981–1984,
1989–1993, 1994–1998, 1999–2004, 2005–2009, 2010–2014.
7
How to delineate permissive from authoritative parenting is not completely obvious; independence
is a natural attribute of permissive parenting, but it may also be a goal for some authoritative parents.
Hard work, however, is distinctively a value upon which permissive parents would not insist. Therefore,
we classify all parents who mention hard work (but do not mention obedience, which is clearly associated with authoritarianism) as authoritative. Below, we discuss robustness results when the value of
“determination and perseverance” is also associated with an authoritative parenting style.

The upper panel shows correlations between the fraction of parents adopting a particular parenting style
in each country-wave and income inequality (90-10 earnings ratio) in the year in which the WVS surveyed
the country (or in closest available observation within a [-2,+1] year interval). The lower panel shows
correlations between the fraction of parents adopting a particular parenting style in Wave 5 and the return
to tertiary education from Montenegro and Patrinos (2014).

(0.72) parenting styles are positively correlated with inequality. Scatter plots of these
relationships are displayed in the upper panel of Figure 3.1. The narrative for specific
countries accords well with the general picture. Inequality is very low in Sweden and
Norway, and these countries have very high shares of permissive parents. Conversely,
in the much more unequal United States, parents are more authoritative and authoritarian.8
The same pattern of correlation emerges if we replace income inequality with the return
8

This pattern is confirmed by breaking down the analysis to the individual values. Consider Wave
5, which has the largest coverage of countries. Among Swedish parents, 78% and 57% mention independence and imagination among top five values, respectively. In contrast, only 10% mention hard work. The
opposite is true in the United States, where only 53% and 31% mention independence and imagination
among their top five values, respectively, while 62% mention hard work.

to tertiary education from Montenegro and Patrinos (2014). The main limitation here
is the lack of comprehensive comparable international data with a panel dimension.
Therefore, we use only the Wave 5 of the WVS, and take the closest available data for
the return to schooling. The lower panel of Figure 3.1 shows a highly positive correlation between the return to education and the authoritative and authoritarian parenting
styles.9 The correlation with the permissive parenting style is instead negative. Interestingly, France and Spain are countries with medium inequality but a medium-high
return to education. In these countries, parents tend to be less permissive.
While so far we have considered only country averages, it is informative to perform
more formal regression analysis using the individual data from the WVS. This allows us
to control for respondents’ individual characteristics such as age and education. We focus on the 90-10 ratio inequality measure, since we do not have reliable panel variation
in the return to education. Table 3.1 displays the relative risk ratios (RRRs) associated
with inequality in multinomial logistic regressions (full regression tables are reported in
the appendix). In all cases, the permissive parenting style is the reference category; thus,
the first coefficient is the RRR for authoritative vs. permissive parenting, while the second coefficient is the RRR for authoritarian vs. permissive parenting. In all regressions,
standard errors are clustered at the country level. Odd and even columns display the
coefficients of regressions without and with country fixed effects, respectively. All specifications control for age, age squared, three classes of education (less than completed
high school, completed high school, and some college or more), and wave fixed effects.
We also control for the country’s GDP per capita (expenditure side, from Penn World
Table 9.0), although this does not affect any of the results.
Columns (1)–(2) are baseline regressions including all respondents, while columns (3)–
(4) only include parents. The results are similar across the two specifications. Inequality
is associated with a higher share of authoritative and authoritarian parents. The results
along the authoritative-permissive margin hold up to the inclusion of country fixed effects. The effect of inequality (which we interpret as correlation) is quantitatively sizeable. The inequality measure ranges from 1.9 to 5, with a standard deviation of 0.8. In
the United States, the inequality measure ranges between 4.5 and 5. Thus, a 2.5 RRR implies large effects, as suggested by Figure 3.1. Columns (5)–(6) control for a self-reported
dummy for religiosity.10 While religiosity is an important determinant of parenting style
9

We obtain similar results with the data for college premia in Krueger et al. (2010). However, their
study only contains data for seven countries.

Dependent variable: parenting style (indicator). The reference category is permissive. All the models
are multinomial logistic models and the displayed coefficients are RRRs. Columns (1) and (2) are based
on the whole sample, columns (3) and (4) only considers parents, columns (5) and (6) include control for
religiosity, columns (7) and (8) consider an alternative classification of parenting style described in the
text. All models include wave fixed effects and controls for gender, age, age squared, and GDP per capita
(log). Inequality is defined as the ratio between the 90th and 10th percentile of gross earnings of full-time
dependent employees. Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered at the country level. *, **, *** indicate
statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level respectively.

at the individual level (see the full regression table in the appendix), it does not alter the
significant RRR associated with inequality. Columns (7)–(8) are based on an alternative
definition of parenting style, where we classify as authoritative all non-authoritarian
parents who mention either hard work or determination and perseverance among top
five values.11 The results are robust to this definition.12
The effects of individual characteristics are interesting in their own right. Consider, first,
how important it is in your life. Would you say religion is: Very Important, Rather Important, Not Very
Important, Not At All Important.” A respondent is classified as religious if (s)he chooses one of the first
two answers.
11
We find this alternative classification less compelling, since permissive parents may also value determination. With this alternative coding, 53% of parents are classified as authoritative, while only 15% and
27% are permissive and authoritarian, respectively. This contrasts with the balanced distribution obtained
from our preferred classification.
12
We also run the same regressions including the nine countries that became OECD members since
1994 (Chile, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Israel, Korea, Mexico, Poland, and Slovenia). The pooled
regressions without country FE continue to indicate the same pattern as in the baseline regressions with
highly significant coefficients. However, the regressions with country fixed effects now yield insignificant
RRRs close to unity.

education. College-educated parents are far less authoritarian. Their RRR (relative to
the reference group “below high school completed”) ranges between 0.3 and 0.4; highschool graduates are in between, with RRRs in the 0.5-0.7 range. Religiosity also has a
sizeable effect: religious people are significantly less permissive and more authoritarian
than non-religious people. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that parents
prepare their children for the world in which they expect their children to live. Many
religious parents believe that the world is regulated by a never-changing order, and that
it is their duty to transmit to their children an immutable set of values and truths. For
instance, Ellison et al. (1996) argue that conservative Protestants in the United States
“. . . consider the Bible to be without error, providing reliable and sufficient insights to
guide the conduct of all human affairs, including child rearing.” In such a world, it is
unnecessary and possibly inadvisable to foster children’s independence and imagination. According to Bartkowski and Ellison (1995), these parents do not emphasize selfconfidence, self-discipline, creativity, and intellectual curiosity, but instead believe that
“. . . to succeed in adult roles, children must be trained to embrace the divinely-ordained
principles of authority and hierarchy” (p.25).
So far, we have considered a measure of pre-tax income inequality. If expectations regarding children’s economic outcomes and exposure to risk really drive the choice of
parenting style, the extent of redistributive taxation and the availability of safety nets
should also matter. To study this possibility, we consider (i) a measure of tax progressivity from the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies (2010) that has recently been
used by Heathcote, Storesletten, and Violante (2016);13 (ii) a measure of aggregate social
expenditure as a percentage of GDP from the OECD Social Expenditure Database. In
both cases, the within-country variation in the measure is very limited, and accordingly
there is little within-country correlation with parenting. Across countries, in contrast,
the results line up well with our findings for overall inequality. Figure 3.2 displays scatter plots of the tax progressivity and social expenditure measures and each of the three
parenting styles. The correlations of permissive, authoritative, and authoritarian parenting with tax progressivity are 0.62, -0.61, and -0.42, respectively, and the correlations
with the social expenditure measure are 0.45, -0.53, and -0.19.14
The results are confirmed by multinomial logistic regressions based on individual data.
13

The measure captures the marginal rate progression up to an income level equivalent to four times a
country’s per capita GDP.
14
All correlations are significant at the 1% level except for the one between social expenditure and
the authoritarian style. The results are similar if one restricts attention to Wave 5 (which is the most
comprehensive wave).

The upper panel shows correlations between the fraction of parents adopting a particular parenting style
in each country-wave and tax progressivity in the year in which each country was surveyed. The lower
panel shows analogous correlations with social expenditure as percentage of GDP.

Columns (1) and (2) of Table 3.2 display results for each measure individually. An increase in either social expenditure or progressive taxation is associated with a significant
fall in the likelihood of the authoritative and authoritarian parenting styles relative to
the permissive style. In short, more redistribution makes parents more permissive. In
column (3), we include both measures as well as the 90-10 ratio inequality measure in the
same regression.15 The results are remarkably stable along the authoritative-permissive
margin. The RRR of inequality is 1.9; tax progressivity has a negative and highly significant effect, while the effect of social expenditure is also negative but marginally insignificant. The results are similar for the authoritarian-permissive margin, although the
coefficient of social expenditure is imprecisely estimated.16
15

We lose some observations since tax progressivity is not available in the period corresponding to
Wave 6.
16
To assess the quantitative effects, note that (i) tax progressivity ranges between 0.28 and 1.12, with a
s.d. of 0.25; (ii) social expenditure ranges between 0.55 and 3.06, with a s.d. of 0.61. In both cases, the

Dependent variable: parenting style (indicator). The reference category is permissive. All models are
multinomial logistic models and the displayed coefficients are RRRs. All models include wave fixed
effects and controls for gender, age, age squared, and GDP per capita (log). Tax progressivity is from
Andrew Young School of Policy Studies (2010). Safety nets are expressed as the aggregate social expenditure in percentage of GDP. Inequality is defined as the ratio between the 90th and 10th percentile of
gross earnings of full-time dependent employees. GDP is the Expenditure-side real GDP at chained PPPs
(Source: Penn World Table 9.0). Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered at the country level. *, **,
*** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level respectively.

Beyond inequality, redistribution, and return to education, the institutional features of
the education system may also affect parenting styles. In some countries, vertical teaching and the memorization of facts are emphasized in secondary schools, and access to
the best universities is rationed by high-stakes university entrance exams. In such countries, parents have a stronger incentive to push their children towards hard work during
adolescence. Depending on other factors, this could take the form of either authoritative or authoritarian parenting. In contrast, in other countries (such as the Scandinavian
countries and Germany) secondary schooling is less intense, and access to higher education less competitive. Emphasizing values such as imagination and independence,
which may pay off later on, should be more attractive in such places. This dimension
might help explain, for example, the case of France (see Algan et al. 2013). Teaching
in French schools is vertical, and access to the country’s elite system of grandes écoles is
restricted. Hence, parents emphasize hard work at the expense of independence and
imagination, even though overall inequality is relatively low.
source variables have been multiplied by 10.

13

In conclusion, the WVS data indicate that low inequality, generous redistributive policies, and low stakes in education are associated with more permissive parents. In more
unequal countries with low redistribution and high stakes in education, parents are
more authoritative, and to some extent also more authoritarian.
3.2 The Historical Decline of Authoritarian Parenting
The second fact that we highlight is the secular decline of the authoritarian parenting
style. While survey evidence of specific parenting practices is only available for the last
few decades, historical evidence suggests that in the pre-industrial period authoritarian
parenting was the norm, including the widespread use and approval of corporal punishment. Based on a sample of autobiographies and diaries, Pollock (1983) documents
that in terms of the range of disciplinary techniques, “surprisingly little changed from
1500 to 1699” (p. 156). His findings are echoed by Plumb (1975), who notes that of “two
hundred counsels of advice on child rearing prior to 1770, only three, Plutarch, Palmieri,
and Sadoleto, failed to recommend that fathers beat their children” (p. 65). With regard
to parenting style in North America, Kaestle and Vinovskis (1980) report that “the early
Puritans had stressed that children were innately evil . . . The only proper response for
parents was to watch their children closely and to discipline them at very young ages.”
Our theory can account for these observations given that traditional societies are characterized by high incumbency premia. Until the onset of industrialization, most people
in the Western world were engaged in agriculture, a sector where children work with
their parents and incumbency (e.g., through land ownership) is important. There was
relatively more mobility among city dwellers working as artisans or craftsmen, but even
there much of skill acquisition took place within the family, and incumbency advantage
was often protected formally through guilds. These factors provided incentives for parents to exert direct control over their children.
With the rise of industrialization in Western Europe and North America in the nineteenth century, an increased division of labor brought about a rise in occupational specialization and occupational mobility. Moreover, from the middle of the nineteenth
century education increasingly took place in schools and universities. These trends increased the importance of choosing an occupation based on talent rather than following
in a parent’s footsteps. Our theory predicts that these changes, over time, should make
authoritarian parenting less attractive. And, indeed, social historians document a gradual change in attitudes towards children and parenting in these times. Pollock (1983)
14

argues that some changes already began in the late eighteenth century, mostly in the
middle and upper ranks of society. Influenced by Rousseau and subsequent reformers
(e.g., Pestalozzi, Froebel, Montessori, and Dewey), the view of “children . . . as innocent
beings that had to be protected and nurtured,” and of childhood as a “distinct phase of
human development that required special attention and training” gained ground in the
more progressive sectors of society (Kaestle and Vinovskis 1980, p. 192).17
The same trends continued in the twentieth century: the practice of corporal punishment slowly declined as close-knit patriarchal families were gradually replaced by a
new model where children received formal education outside the home. The increase
in mobility was fostered by the rise of pension programs and old-age health insurance,
which made parents less dependent on their children’s material and physical care in
old age. As the employment share of agriculture declined, fewer and fewer children
continued in their parents’ occupation.18 Even within occupations, the more rapid pace
of technological change led to a faster depreciation of knowledge, which reduced the
amount of useful knowledge that parents could teach to their own children (Galor and
Tsiddon 1997, Hassler and Rodriguez Mora 2000). For example, a parent who works
as an accountant may lack the computer skills necessary for new entrants in the occupation. The decline of authoritarian parenting accelerated in the 1960s with the rise of
the anti-authoritarian “hippie” culture. At this time, inequality measures, which had
been falling from the late nineteenth century, reached an all-time low (Piketty and Saez
2003). In addition, educational attainment was rising, but the college premium fell (Katz
and Murphy 1992, Gottschalk 1997). According to our theory, the combination of an increasing return to independence, waning direct control of parents over children (due to
education moving from the family to formal institutions), and a low return to human
capital investment made permissive parenting attractive during this time.
Appendix Figure B.1 shows two cross-country correlations that accord with the historical change in advanced economies. The share of authoritarian parents in the World
Value Survey is positively correlated with the employment share of agriculture, and
negatively correlated with the gross enrollment ratio in tertiary education. As discussed
17

According to Guttormsson (2002), the influence of enlightened educators was stronger in the industrial areas of Northwestern Europe. There, among the urban middle-class families, “the mood was shifting
away from beating as a routine punishment . . . towards the application of moral and emotional pressures
developing in children a capacity for self-government” (Guttormsson 2002, p. 267–268). In contrast, the
authoritarian parenting style remained unquestioned within the working class.
18
According to Long and Ferrie (2013), in the United States intergenerational mobility across broad
categories (farmer, white collar etc.) actually fell going into the twentieth century. However, occupations
also became more differentiated.

15

above, in agriculture incumbency premia are high, children’s effort is easy to monitor,
and the economic return to independence is low; all these conditions increase the appeal of an authoritarian parenting style. The opposite is true in societies where higher
education is key for human capital accumulation.
3.3 The Rise of Helicopter Parenting
Next, we turn to changes that occurred during the last half century. Hsieh et al. (2013)
document that since the 1970s, U.S. society has become significantly more fluid: there
is more occupational mobility, there are fewer gender- and race-related barriers in the
labor market, and the allocation of talent has improved. During the same period, wage
dispersion across workers of a given education level started increasing. Marimon and
Zilibotti (1999) and Violante (2002) interpret this fact as evidence of a growing importance of matching individual talent and occupation. Both the reduction in frictions in
the labor market and the increased role of individual talent imply a lower relative importance of incumbency. In terms of the return to human capital, the earlier trend towards lower inequality has reversed. Since the 1980s, income inequality has increased,
largely driven by increasing returns to education and within-group earning inequality,
especially in the United States and the United Kingdom. This new trend has raised
the stakes in parenting, in the sense that acquiring education and putting in high effort
throughout one’s career gained in importance for economic success.
In the data we also observe a new trend towards more involved parents. Ramey and
Ramey (2010) show that in the United States, weekly hours spent on child care by mothers and fathers have increased markedly from the mid-1980s. 19 This rise in child care
time corresponds to the widely discussed phenomenon of helicopter parenting, i.e., the
observation that parents “hover” over their children at various activities to guide and
protect them. At the same time, support for coercive methods and corporal punishment
has continued to slide; instead, helicopter parenting is authoritative in nature.20
19

Ramey and Ramey (2010) suggest that this trend may be driven by increased competition for admission to top colleges (see also Sevilla and Borra 2015 for a study on the effect of competition for university
places in the U.K.). We formalize a similar mechanism, although here the broad return to education matters, rather than competition for spots at the most elite institutions.
20
The waning appeal of permissive parenting is also reflected in the debate on teaching practices. Over
the last two decades, we observe a new shift of emphasis in school authorities towards tests and high
achievement. Yet, this counterrevolution did not reinstate, for the most part, the coercive methods of the
1950s. Rather, the combination of motivational and learning goals resemble characteristics of authoritative
parenting (see Darling 1994).

Data from American Time Use Survey. Child care time comprises the same categories used in Ramey and
Ramey (2010). Average time use is computed by regressing individual time use on interacted dummy
variables for gender, survey year, education category, and age category. “More Educated” corresponds to
B.A. degree or higher, “Less Educated” to high school degree or less. Plotted results are average time use
for parents in age group 25–34.

Figures 3.3 and 3.4 show that the trend towards more involved parenting (in terms of
time use) and towards lower approval of corporal punishment are more pronounced
among more educated parents. In the 1970s, there was little difference in these dimensions between parents with at most high school education and parents with a university
degree. In the 2000s, educated parents spent significantly more effort on raising their
children, and many fewer of them approved of the use of corporal punishment by parents.21 The observed changes are quantitatively large. For example, in 1975 an average
college-educated couple aged 25–34 spent 16.6 hours on child care per week (mother
and father combined). By 2012, that same couple would have spent 30.5 hours, an in21

In a similar vein, Ramey and Ramey (2010) document that in neighboring Canada parenting time has
increased much less than in the United States. Interestingly, the return to education also increased much
less in Canada, which according to our theory could result in a more relaxed approach to parenting.
Guryan et al. (2008) show that that highly educated mothers spend more time on child care than mothers
with less education in 14 different industrialized countries, although they do not consider changes over
time.

17

crease of more than 80 percent.22 Meanwhile, spanking was met with almost universal
approval in the late 1960s, whereas among the highly educated now almost half disapprove. In Appendix B.3, we discuss additional evidence from the General Social Survey
showing that since the mid-1980s, many more parents emphasize the importance of
children working hard while fewer say that it is important for children to obey, which
is again consistent with a decline of authoritarian and a rise of authoritative parenting. The quantitative evidence accords well with the observations on class differences
in parenting in Annette Lareau’s book “Unequal Childhoods” (Lareau 2003). Lareau
describes how upper middle-class parents engage in time-intensive “concerted cultivation” of their children, whereas working-class parents are less engaged, implying that
their children forgo some opportunities but are also less pressured.
One interpretation of these trends is that in college-educated families the return to education is higher (due to inheritability of skill and oblique transmission in the family),
making these families more responsive to the rise in the education premium. A complementary explanation is that there are differences across education groups in the technology of preference transmission. Specifically, a college education may improve parents’
ability to motivate their own children and instill education-oriented values in them,
i.e., educated parents may have a comparative advantage at authoritative parenting.
This accords with a literature in developmental psychology showing that authoritative
methods are used more frequently in educated families, whereas less educated parents
are more prone to resort to authoritarian methods (Kohn 1977, Straus and Stewart 1999).
3.4 Parenting Style and Educational Outcomes
Our explanation for changes in parenting hinges on the notion that parenting style has
an impact on children’s performance in education and, ultimately, their future prospects.
We conclude our discussion of motivating evidence by showing that in the United States,
parenting style is indeed correlated with children’s school performance. Here, we focus
on documenting the empirical association between parenting and children’s outcomes,
without directly addressing causality (that is, we do not argue that variation in parenting style is exogenous).23
22

The change is even more dramatic if measured in per child terms; conditional on having at least one
child, the average number of children in this group was 1.94 in 1975 and 1.85 in 2012. The decline in
fertility may itself be related to the new trend in parenting style, since authoritative parenting is more
demanding in terms of parental time.
23
Assessing the causal effects of parenting style would a promising area for future research, as would
be the use of large administrative data sets for examining long-run effects on a larger set of outcomes.

Data from General Social Survey (GSS, 1986–2014) and from “Study of Political Violence Attitudes, Personal Experiences with Violence, Emotional Reactions to Assassination and Violence in the Media, 1968”
(ICPSR Study No. 7354). Displayed is fraction of adults who approve of the use of corporal punishment
in a given year, averaged over five-year intervals. The survey question in the 1968 survey is: “Are there
any situations that you can imagine in which you would approve of a parent spanking his or her child
assuming the child is healthy and over a year old?” The survey question in the GSS is: “Do you strongly
agree, agree, disagree, or strongly disagree that it is sometimes necessary to discipline a child with a good,
hard spanking?” Approval is defined as sum of fraction of parents who strongly agree or agree.

We rely on data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youths 1997 (NLSY).24 The
parenting style variables in the NLSY are constructed from two questions asking children whether their parents are (i) “supportive,” and (ii) “strict/demanding.” Following
Maccoby and Martin (1983), we classify as permissive parents who are supportive but
not strict, as authoritarian parents who are strict but not supportive, as authoritative
parents who are both, and as neglecting parents who are neither. In Appendix B.4, we
show how parenting styles vary with the socioeconomic characteristics of parents in the
NLSY. An increase in parental education is associated with a lower propensity to be a
neglecting or authoritarian parent, and with an increase in the propensity to be authori24

The NLSY is a nationally representative survey of ca. 9,000 youths who were 12 to 16 years old at
the end of 1996. In 1997, both parents and children were interviewed, including a set of questions on
parenting style. The youths are subsequently interviewed annually as they progress through adult life.

tative.
Today’s environment is characterized by a high return to independence and a high return to education. Consequently, we expect that children’s educational performance
should benefit from having some freedom (i.e., a non-authoritarian parenting style),
and some demands (i.e., an authoritative style is expected to lead to the best results).
The evidence from the NLSY confirms this expectation. Columns (1) to (3) of Table 3.3
display results for OLS regressions of the child’s high school grade point average (GPA)
on both the mother’s and the father’s parenting style (which are observed separately,
albeit highly correlated). The first column shows results for a basic specification where,
in addition to parenting style, only age and age squared are included as control vari20

ables. The results show that authoritarian parenting has a significantly positive and
quantitatively large association with the child’s GPA; permissive parenting (in particular on part of the mother) is associated with slightly worse outcomes; and authoritarian
and neglecting parenting (the omitted category) are linked to the lowest likelihood of
educational success for the child.
The associations in column (1) may reflect omitted variables that correlate with both
parenting and education outcomes, such as parents’ skill and education (which can lead
to a direct transmission of skills within the family) and socioeconomic background. Column (2) adds parental education (years of education for each parent), race and ethnicity
controls, and a control for the gender of the child; column (3) includes, in addition,
family income in 1997. These family characteristics have remarkably little effect on the
parameter estimates for parenting styles; both in terms of magnitude and statistical significance, all columns give rise to similar basic results. Hence, parenting style is not
merely a reflection of social class or parental education.
The NLSY also provides information on children’s educational achievements beyond
high school. Columns (4) to (6) of Table 3.3 present parallel results for the probability
for the child to attain at least a bachelor’s degree (i.e., four years of education beyond
high school). The results are similar to those for GPA: permissive and authoritative
parenting are associated with a substantially higher likelihood of success for the child
compared to authoritarian and neglecting parenting, and authoritative parenting yields
the highest chance of success overall (although in this case the difference to permissive
parenting is small).

4 A Dynastic Model of Parenting Styles
In this section, we present a general model of parenting choices, which generates distinct
“parenting styles” as equilibrium outcomes. In Sections 5–6, we specialize the model to
a setting with a central role of human capital accumulation shaped by patience and
risk preferences, and show that its predictions are in line with the empirical evidence
discussed in Section 3.
4.1 The Decision Problems of Parents and Children
The model economy is populated by overlapping generations of people who live for
two periods, childhood and parenthood. Each parent has one child. The period utility function is defined on a consumption vector c and a preference vector a. A child’s
21

preferences can be influenced by the parent through child-rearing effort. The preference
vector a is acquired during childhood and affects utility in both periods of life. Age also
has an effect on preferences. For instance, a child may be intrinsically less patient or less
risk averse than an adult. Thus, there are separate period utility functions for children
U y (c|a) and for adults U o (c|a), where in general U y (c|a) ̸= U o (c|a).
A child makes economic decisions denoted by x ∈ X, where X is the set of feasible
choices. A child’s choices are affected by three state vectors: (i) her own preference
vector a; (ii) a vector of economic state variables h such as human capital; (iii) the realization of a stochastic state variable s that captures the role of uncertainty, for example
regarding luck in the labor market or the realization of an ability shock.
A parent makes two child-rearing choices. First, she molds her children’s preferences
by choosing the preference vector a′ ∈ A, where A is a fixed set of feasible preferences.
Second, she can take actions that restrict or expand the set X ∈ X (h, s) from which
her child will be able to choose, where X (h, s) is the set of feasible choice sets, which
may depend on the parent’s state variables h and s. Child rearing entails an effort cost
e (X, a′ |h, s), assumed to be separable from the adult’s utility from consumption. We
abstract for simplicity from adult economic decisions such as labor supply or retirement.
Thus, consumption is pinned down directly by the state vector through the function
C o (h, s), which captures budget and other constraints.
We formulate the parent’s and child’s decision problems recursively. The parent’s value
function is given by:
v o (a, h, s) = max
{U o (co |a) − e (X, a′ |h, s) + δw (X, a′ |a)}
o ′
c ,a ,X

subject to co = C o (h, s) and X ∈ X (h, s). Here, w (X, a′ |a) is utility the parent derives
from the child’s experience, and δ measures the overall degree of altruism.
The child’s value function is given by:
v y (X, a′ ) = max
{Es′ [U y (cy |a′ ) + βv o (a′ , h′ , s′ )]}
y
′
c ,x,h

subject to cy = C y (x, s′ ), h′ = H(x, s′ ), and x ∈ X.
Parenting choices hinge on how the child’s choices enter the utility of the parent. If
w (X, a′ |a) = v y (X, a′ ), this would be a standard altruistic-dynasty problem with investment in preferences (as in Doepke and Zilibotti 2008). However, here we allow for the
22

possibility that the parent evaluates the child’s consumption sequence differently than
does the child herself. We label such a difference as paternalism. Specifically, we postulate that the utility a parent derives from her child’s experiences is given by:
w (X, a′ |a) = Es′ [(1 − λ) U y (cy |a′ ) + λU o (cy |a) + βv o (a′ , h′ , s′ )] .

(1)

When evaluating (1), the parent takes into account that the child’s preferences a′ and
choice set X jointly determine the child’s choice of x. More formally, cy , x, and h′ are
given by a decision rule (cy , x, h′ |X, a′ ) arising from the child’s optimization problem.
The function w (X, a′ |a) given in (1) comprises both an altruistic and a paternalistic component. Altruism is the standard enjoyment of the child’s own utility as in Becker (1974),
while paternalism is the evaluation of the child’s actions through the lens of the parent’s
utility function. The altruistic and paternalistic components enter the parent’s value
function with weights 1 − λ and λ, respectively. Paternalism applies only to childhood,
and not to the child’s felicity when the child has grown up. Hence, the child’s adult-age
utility enters the parent’s value function as β v o , where β is the discount factor between
the child and the adult period and v o is the value function of the child when she turns
into a parent. Restricting paternalistic motives to childhood is broadly realistic because
preferences change with age, implying that there is more scope for conflict with an adolescent than with a grown-up child. The formulation also has the advantage that it implies a recursive representation of the choice problem, which is used widely in related
dynastic settings.
4.2 Parenting Styles
We are now ready to introduce a formal definition of parenting styles, based on the
Baumrind classification in developmental psychology.
Definition 1. Consider a parent who makes the parenting choices a′ = a∗ and X = X ∗ . We
define the following four parenting styles:
1. Authoritarian: A parent is authoritarian if there exists an X̃ ∈ X such that v y (X ∗ , a∗ ) <
v y (X̃, a∗ ) and e (X ∗ , a∗ |h, s) ≥ e(X̃, a∗ |h, s). That is, an authoritarian parent spends
effort to constrain the child’s choice for a purpose other than making the child happy.
2. Authoritative: A parent is authoritative if there exists an ã′ ∈ A such that v y (X ∗ , a∗ ) <
v y (X ∗ , ã′ ) and e (X ∗ , a∗ |h, s) ≥ e(X ∗ , ã′ |h, s). That is, an authoritative parent spends
effort to mold the child’s preferences for a purpose other than making the child happy.
23

3. Neglecting: A parent is neglecting if for all X̃ ∈ X and ã′ ∈ A, we have e (X ∗ , a∗ |h, s) ≤
e(X̃, ã′ |h, s), with a strict inequality for at least one pair X̃, ã′ . That is, a neglecting parent
makes the parenting choices that minimize parenting effort.
4. Permissive: A parent is permissive if she does not meet the definitions of any of the other
parenting styles. That is, a permissive parents refrains from influencing the child’s choice,
but also does not simply minimize parenting effort.
If the choice sets X in the feasible set X (h, s) are nested, authoritarian parenting implies
restricting the child’s choice to a smaller set than the largest possible. Authoritarian and
authoritative parents exert effort to affect their children’s behavior, even at the cost of
reducing their cardinal utility. These two styles are not mutually exclusive, as parents
may exercise effort to both restrict the children’s choice and change their preferences.
We sometimes refer to parents who are either authoritarian or authoritative (or a combination of the two) as engaging in intensive parenting. Neglecting parents minimize
parenting effort.25 In contrast, permissive parents do spend effort on parenting, but they
do so solely in order to increase the child’s choice set and utility.
Our model articulates specific motives that induce parents to choose a particular parenting style among those in Definition 1. In the appendix, we state and prove (Propositions
A.1–A.4) some general properties of the model. First, if parents are fully altruistic in
a Beckerian sense (i.e., λ = 0), they have no motive for exercising effort in a way that
lowers their children’s utility. Thus, such parents are either permissive or neglecting.
Second, if parents exercise some effort either to restrict their children’s choice or to mold
their preferences, they must do so in order to affect their behavior. Finally, if parents
mold their children’s preferences to the extent that there is no disagreement about what
the children should do, there is no point to restricting their choice set. In the appendix,
we also characterize the decision problem when the problem is differentiable.

5 Parenting Styles in a Model of Patience and Investment in Skills
Our model of parenting styles is sufficiently flexible to be applied to many kinds of
choices children make and that their parents may disagree with. However, based on
The condition that there is at least one choice of X̃, ã′ that would require higher effort in the definition
of neglecting parenting is imposed to capture the case where there is no effort cost for molding the children’s choices and preferences (an example of this kind will be given below). Without the requirement of
at least one strict inequality, in such a case all parents would be neglecting by definition, which would not
be a desirable feature of a model of parenting styles.
25

24

the discussion of the evidence in Section 3, we conjecture that the key dimension that
accounts for much of the variation in parenting styles in the data consists of potential
disagreements about future-oriented investments (such as education). Accordingly, in
this section we specialize our model to a deliberately simple environment with a central
role for human-capital investment and the transmission of time preferences (patience),
and use this model to shed light on the socioeconomic determinants of parenting style.
The underlying friction in this setting is that children are innately less patient than their
parents would like them to be. As a result, children may be unwilling to undertake
investments, such as educational effort, at the level that their parents would consider
optimal. Parents can increase their children’s relative appreciation of future rewards by
imbuing them with a sense of guilt about immediate gratification. This comes at the
cost of lowering the child’s utility. Alternatively, a parent can act in an authoritarian
way, i.e., directly force her child to undertake the investment the parent desires. This
option also comes at a cost: it stifles the child’s independent discovery of her own talent
and thus may diminish the child’s success in the labor market. While specialized, we
argue that this setting captures a key aspect of potential disagreement between parents
and children, and can provide a plausible interpretation of the empirical observations
on the variation in parenting styles described in Section 3.
5.1 Environment
We parameterize preferences by an isoelastic utility function. The parent’s felicity is
given by U o (co |a) = (co )1−σ / (1 − σ), where we assume 0 < σ < 1, implying that utility
is positive. The child’s choice x is a two-dimensional vector comprising an occupational
choice and an educational investment, which together imply a (stochastic) level of consumption. The child’s felicity is given by:
(cy )1−σ
.
U (c |a) = a
1−σ
y

y

Here the parameter a ∈ A = [1, ā], where ā > 1 captures children’s innate preference for
instant gratification. The preference parameter a is chosen by the parent, and the possibility of choosing a < ā captures the option for parents to stifle the child’s enjoyment of
young-age consumption. Although cardinal utility is maximized by setting a = ā, the
parent may choose a lower a in order to make the child more patient.26
26

Note that in this application a affects only the young-age felicity. One could argue that patience
additionally yields a better ability to enjoy future (old-age) consumption. Such a specification would give

25

The child’s choice vector x has two components: an occupational choice xµ and an effort
choice xe ∈ [0, 1], where the latter can be interpreted as effort in formal education and
as the acquisition of skills on the job. Both choices, together with the realization of an
exogenous stochastic shock s′ , determine the accumulation of human capital, h′ = (x, s′ ),
where x = [xµ , xe ]. The return to education effort xe is determined by a parameter R.
The budget constraints and laws of motion for human capital are then given by:
cy = C y (x, s′ ) = (1 − xe ) y (xµ , s′ ) ,
co = C o (h, s′ ) = h′ ,
h′ = h (x, s′ ) = (1 + Rxe ) y (xµ , s′ ) .
The function y (xµ , s′ ) captures individual productivity, determined by the occupational
choice and the individual realization of the shock. The microfoundation for the impact
of the occupational choice on productivity is as follows. There are different occupations
that a child can choose from. The productivity of an individual in a given occupation
has two components: first, there is her individual talent for that occupation, which may
be high (yH ) or low (yL < yH ); second, there is a premium for working in the same
profession as one’s parent, denoted by µ ≥ 1. This incumbency premium reflects the
acquisition of skills within the family as well as entry barriers (e.g., guilds or professional associations that protect incumbent families). There are two possible strategies
for choosing an occupation, given by xµ ∈ {xHOM E , xSEARCH }. First, the child could
stay at home and follow in the parents’ footsteps, xµ = xHOM E . In this case, the child
benefits from the premium µ. However, this occupation may or may not be the best
match with her talent, so that:

(
)  µyH with probability 0.5,
y xHOM E , s =
 µy
with probability 0.5.
L

Alternatively, the child could leave home and independently search for her true calling. In this case, the child always finds an occupation for which she has talent, so that
(
)
y xSEARCH , s′ = yH , independently of s′ .
Next, consider the parental choice of the child’s choice set X. Here, we assume that
when the child stays at home, the parent can perfectly monitor her effort choice xe . In
contrast, when the child leaves home, she can choose xe independently. This implies
similar results.

26

that the set of feasible choice sets X comprises two subsets, X = {X HOM E , X F REE }.
Here, X HOM E is the more restricted choice set for a child who stays at home. Since the
parent retains control, it is optimal for the parent to assign the effort that is optimal from
the parent’s perspective, which we denote by x̄e . In addition, the child is forced to adopt
the parent’s occupation. We therefore have:27

X F REE can be interpreted as granting the child independence. For example, a child born
on a farm may be allowed to study in the city, so as to ultimately find the occupation that
best suits her. Once the child has moved to the city, however, the parent loses control
over her choices, and the child may decide to slack off rather than invest in her future
success. Formally,

Note that X HOM E ⊂ X F REE .
Since the parent’s utility depends only on her human capital (the preference parameter
a affects only young age utility, and the shock s affects future utility only through its
impact on h), we can write v o (a, h, s) = v o (h) and w (X, a′ |a) = w (X, a′ ). The parent’s
value function can be written as:
v o (h) =

h1−σ
+ max {−e (X, a′ |h) + δw (X, a′ )} .
1 − σ a′ ∈A,X∈X

To characterize the choices of a′ and X, it is useful to first consider optimal choices conditional on being authoritarian, and then compare authoritarian parenting to the other
possible styles. We first consider the case where parental effort is costless, e (X, a′ |h) = 0.
27

In principle, another alternative would be for the parent to keep the child at home, but still let the
child choose effort xe freely. However, this choice set is (at least weakly) dominated from the parent’s
perspective.

27

5.2 Authoritarian Parenting
In this environment, a parent adopts an authoritarian parenting style if she chooses
X = X HOM E . Since the choice set X of the child is now a singleton, the corollary of
Proposition A.2 implies that the parent will choose a′ = ā. Since the parent is uncertain about her child’s productivity in the parent’s occupation, the continuation utility
involves expectations:

It is useful to note, for future reference, that x̄e → 1 as R → ∞. Thus, for large R,
(
)
w̃ X HOM E , ā is determined entirely by adult-age felicity.28 Conversely, we have x̄e = 0
if R = 0: there is no point in exerting effort if the return to effort is zero.
5.3 Non-Authoritarian Parenting
We now describe the choice of a parent who grants independence to the child by selecting the choice set X F REE . Unless the incumbency premium µ is very large, the child
moves to the city and chooses the occupation according to her comparative advantage,
thus y = yH . We assume that even if the child eventually chooses the same occupation
28

This result hinges on the assumption that σ > 1, implying that the substitution effect dominates over
the income effect.

28

as her parent, the incumbency premium µ is available only if the child stays at home.
The parent’s continuation utility can be broken down as follows:

Hence, while the parent cannot dictate a particular effort choice to the child, the parent can influence the choice through setting a′ . We can now characterize the optimal choice of a′ , i.e., the degree to which the parent stifles the child’s enjoyment of
young-age consumption in order to induce more patience. It is convenient to define
cy (xe (a′ )) = (1 − xe (a′ )) yH .
Lemma 5.1. Conditional on a non-authoritarian parenting style, the optimal choice of the child’s
preferences a′ satisfies the following condition:
cy (xe (a′ ))

where the strict inequality holds if and only if a′ = ā.
The marginal benefit in (6) is positive since lowering a′ causes an increase in the human
29

capital investment that the parent approves of (note that cya′ > 0). The marginal cost
captures the utility loss suffered by the child from being brain-washed with adult-like
values. How the parent weighs costs and benefits depends on the extent of paternalism.
If λ = 0, the marginal benefit vanishes, and the optimal solution is a corner, a′ = ā, corresponding to a permissive parenting style. By continuity, a permissive parenting style
is also optimal for a range of low values for the paternalism parameter λ. In contrast, if
λ = 1 the parent does not care about the utility loss inflicted on the child. In this case,
it is optimal to set a′ = 1, i.e., the parent adopts a purely authoritative style, inducing
the child to take the same action that the parent would choose. The following lemma
summarizes the discussion.
Lemma 5.2. Let a∗ denote the optimal choice of a′ , defined implicitly by (7). There exists λ > 0
such that, for all λ ≤ λ, a∗ = ā (permissive parenting style). For λ = 1, a∗ = 1 (purely
authoritative parenting style).
We can now establish a key result regarding the role of the return to human capital
investment R for the choice between permissive and authoritative parenting.

Conversely, if λ ≤ σ ā−(1−σ)

The parent prefers a permissive style if the return to human capital is low (R < R̄), and
an authoritative style if the return to human capital is high (R ≥ R̄ ). In the high range,
the extent to which the parent molds the child’s preferences is increasing in R.29
5.4 Equilibrium Parenting Style

permissive or authoritative) parenting. This choice hinges on the return to incumbency

µ. In particular, for a fixed R, there exists a unique threshold µ̂(R) such that for µ ≥ µ̂(R)
parents choose to be authoritarian.
The left panel of Figure 5.1 displays the optimal parenting style as a function of the return to human capital R and the incumbency premium µ, given parameters σ = 0.5,
β = 0.8, λ = 0.95, ā = 1.5, and yH /yL = 1.5. The figure shows that the critical level
µ̂(R) above which parents are authoritarian is first decreasing and then increasing in
R. The reason is that the threshold depends on the severity of the agency problem in
choosing education effort. If R = 0, there is no disagreement, because parents and children agree that optimal effort is zero. Disagreement also vanishes as R → ∞, since then
both parents and children think that maximum effort should be devoted to education.30
However, the agency problem bites for intermediate values of R. In this region, controlling the effort of the child becomes more attractive for the parent, and thus the threshold
µ̂(R) shifts downward (i.e., to the left in Figure 5.1).31
Consider the choice between authoritative and permissive parenting for µ < µ̂(R). As
shown in Proposition 5.1, in this region there is a fixed threshold R̄ such that for R > R̄,
parents are authoritative, and for R ≤ R̄ they are permissive. Proposition 5.1 implies
that for sufficiently low λ, authoritative parenting is never optimal. That is, if we lower
λ, the boundary between permissive and authoritative parenting in Figure 5.1 first shifts
upward and then disappears altogether.
30

In this case, an authoritarian parenting style is chosen over a permissive parenting only if the incumbency premium exceeds the value of flexibility. This threshold is defined in Proposition 5.2.
31
Interestingly, the µ̂(R) function is constant (i.e., the boundary between authoritarian and the other
parenting styles in Figure 5.1 is vertical) when either λ = 0 or when λ = 1. The reason is that in these
extreme cases the agency problem is entirely resolved, either because the parent completely agrees with
the child (λ = 0) or because the child is indoctrinated to completely agree with the parent (λ = 1).

31

Proposition 5.2 summarizes our results.
Proposition 5.2. There exists a function µ̂(R) where 0 < µ̂(R) ≤ µ̄ such that:
ā
1) If λ > σ ā−(1−σ)
, then:

• If µ > µ̂(R), parents choose an authoritarian style.
• If µ ≤ µ̂(R) and R > R̄, parents choose an authoritative style.
• If µ ≤ µ̂(R) and R ≤ R̄, parents choose a permissive style.
ā
2) If λ ≤ σ ā−(1−σ)
, then:

• If µ > µ̂(R), parents choose an authoritarian style.
• If µ ≤ µ̂(R), parents choose a permissive style.
Here, R̄ is the threshold characterized in Proposition 5.1, and µ̄ is the threshold where the incumbency premium exactly offsets the value of flexibility, given by:
µ̄ ≡

((

) ( 1−σ
)) 1
1−σ
2yH
/ yH + yL1−σ 1−σ .

Moreover, µ(0) = limR→∞ µ̂(R) = µ̄, and µ̂(R) < µ̄ for 0 < R < ∞.
The parameter space can be broken down in three regions.32 For a high incumbency
premium, the authoritarian style is optimal. For a low incumbency premium and a low
return to human capital, permissive parenting is adopted. Finally, for a low incumbency
premium and a high return to human capital, parents choose to be authoritative.
The right panel of Figure 5.1 summarizes our interpretation of the historical evolution of
parenting styles discussed in the introduction and in Section 3. We view pre-industrial
economies as characterized by a high incumbency premium µ and a low return to human capital R. Hence, initially an authoritarian parenting style is adopted. Subsequently, industrialization brings about an erosion of incumbency advantage, an increase
in occupational specialization, and a rising demand for human capital. These trends are

prevalence of permissive parenting. The most recent decades feature a further decline
in the incumbency premium µ and a rise in the return to human capital R, leading to the
current situation where authoritative parenting is dominant.33
As Proposition 5.2 shows, the qualitative characterization of equilibrium parenting style
does not depend on specific parameter values, except that the authoritative style only
emerges if parents are sufficiently paternalistic (which is the case for the illustrative
parametrization underlying Figure 5.1). However, the sharp delineation between parenting styles obtained here does benefit from simplifying assumptions, in particular that
there is a binary choice between being authoritarian and granting independence, with a
discrete impact on expected future income. A richer model could allow for restricting
children’s choice in a more continuous way (we describe such a setting in the context
of the general model in the appendix). The basic intuition for how the incumbency
premium and the return to human capital affect parenting should carry over to such a
setting, but a full discussion would necessitate going beyond discrete parenting styles
and talking about degrees of employing authoritarian or authoritative strategies.
5.5 Heterogeneity in the Cost of Parenting
So far, we have abstracted from parental effort costs. In this section, we consider heterogeneity in the cost of parenting. There are two types of dynasties, distinguished by skill.
For high-skill parents, molding their children’s preferences is costless, as in the previous
section. In contrast, low-skill parents who engage in authoritative parenting face a cost
given by:

 0 if a′ = ā,
A ′
e (a |h, s) =
 eA if a′ < ā.
This assumption is in line with the discussion in Section 3.2, where we argue that education improves parents’ ability to motivate their children and mold their preferences.34
To start with, consider a society where the return to incumbency is low, and hence the
33

Figure 5.1 is drawn for a particular value of the paternalism parameter (λ = 0.95). We view the
population as heterogeneous in λ, and to some extent the incumbency premium and the return to human
capital investment may vary across families as well (see below). Thus, the evolution depicted in Figure 5.1
does not necessarily affect all families equally, but should be interpreted as broad trends that shift the
distribution across the parenting styles in the population.
34
Another source of heterogeneity could stem from the distinction between time and goods costs of
parenting. If costs were in terms of goods, richer parents would face a lower effective cost of investing
(due to higher consumption and lower marginal utility). However, given that time costs are arguably
more important, we do not emphasize this aspect here.

33

relevant margin is between permissive and authoritative parenting (namely, all parents
choose X F REE ). We can establish the following result.35
Proposition 5.3. For given parameters, there exist thresholds for the degree of paternalism
λ̄H , λ̄L where 0 < λ̄H < λ̄L < 1 such that: (i) no parents with λ < λ̄H exert effort in molding
their children’s preferences; (ii) no low-skill parents with λ ∈ [λ̄H , λ̄L ] and all high-skill parents with λ ∈ [λ̄H , λ̄L ] exert effort in molding their children’s preferences; (iii) all parents with
λ > λ̄L exert effort in molding their children’s preferences.
In this environment, we can consider again the effect of an increase in the return to
education effort R. The incentive to exert child-rearing effort increases for all parents.
(
)
Paternalistic parents with λ ∈ λ̄L , 1 will respond on the intensive margin by increasing their parental effort, and so will high-skill parents with λ ∈ [λ̄H , λ̄L ]. In addition,
there will be some response on the extensive margin for both types. The range of λ for
which parents continue to be permissive and do not react to the change in R will be
larger for low-skill parents. Although the average response hinges on the distribution
of λ in the population, the fact that the range of inaction is larger for low-skill parents
suggests that, as a group, high-skill parents will respond more strongly to an increase in
R. The predictions of the theory are consistent with the evidence on parental time use
by education discussed in Section 3.2 and with Putnam (2015), who argues that today
American children are exposed to a much more unequal upbringing than a half century
ago.
Next, consider in the same setting the case in which µ is sufficiently large so that authoritarian parenting is also a relevant choice. For simplicity, assume that eA is sufficiently
large that low-skill parents are never authoritative. The following proposition characterizes the parenting choices in this setting.
Proposition 5.4. There exist functions µ̂L (R) and µ̂(R) where 0 < µ̂L (R) ≤ µ̂(R) ≤ µ̄ such
that:
ā
, then:
1) If λ > σ ā−(1−σ)

• If µ ≥ µ̂(R), all parents choose an authoritarian style.
• If µ ∈ [µ̂L (R), µ̂(R)] and R > R̄, high-skill parents choose an authoritative style and
low-skill parents choose an authoritarian style.
35

The proof is an immediate extension of the proof of Proposition 5.2 and is omitted.

• If µ < µ̂(R), parents choose a permissive style.
Here R̄ and µ̄ are the same as in Proposition 5.2.
Likewise, µ(0) = limR→∞ µ̂L (R) = limR→∞ µ̂(R) = µ̄, and µ̂L (R) < µ̄ for 0 < R < ∞.
Figure 5.2 provides a numerical illustration of the result.36 An interesting implication
of the analysis is that from an initial condition in which all parents are authoritarian,
a decline in the incumbency premium µ can induce diverging behavior between lowand high-skill parents: the former remain authoritarian, while the latter turn authoritative. Such a divergence is consistent with the observation that in the United States,
the decline in the approval of corporal punishment in recent decades has been much

35

more pronounced among the educated (see Figure 3.4). Alternatively, if we start from a
situation where all parents are permissive, an increase in R turns low-skill parents authoritarian, and high-skill parents authoritative. Overall, this pattern lines up with the
observations that over the last decades parenting style has become more intensive and
that the behavior of different socioeconomic groups has diverged.
The parenting cost considered in this section implies that it is costly (for some parents)
to mold children’s preferences away from the natural inclination. Another dimension
of parenting cost is the possibility that the parent can spend effort to expand the child’s
choice set in a way that makes the child better off, for example by opening up additional
educational opportunities. Such an extension would allow for all four parenting styles,
where neglecting parents would be the ones who minimize parenting effort rather than
making investments to benefit the children.

6 Parenting Styles in a Model of Risk Aversion and Protective Parents
The theory can also be applied to another important dimension of preferences, namely,
the attitude towards risk. Risk aversion is known to increase with age (Morin and Fernandez Suarez 1983), leading to a natural conflict between parents and children regarding risky behavior. Risk aversion is also known to matter for important aspects of human behavior. For instance, Barsky et al. (1997) document that risk tolerance is associated with hazardous behaviors that tend to lower economic success, such as smoking
and drinking, but also with a more aggressive investing style that yields higher average
returns, such as holding stocks rather than bonds. Risk tolerance is also an important
driver of entrepreneurship as shown, e.g., by Cramer et al. (2002) and Kan and Tsai
(2006). Dohmen et al. (2012) document that trust and risk attitudes are strongly correlated between parents and children in the German Socioeconomic Panel. Using the
same data set, Zumbuehl et al. (2013) find that parents who invest more in child-rearing
efforts are more similar to their children in terms of attitudes towards risk. All these
studies concur on the importance of the transmission of attitudes towards risk within
families.
In line with the analysis in the previous sections, we focus on the relationship between
income inequality and preference transmission. In Section 5, we emphasize the dimension of preferences that regulates the intertemporal trade-off in consumption, a key determinant of human capital investments. However, success in education and the labor
market also hinges on young people avoiding hazardous behaviors that may tempt ado36

lescents: consumption of street drugs, unprotected sex, delinquency, etc. Parents typically disapprove of such activities, not least because they can harm their children’s future prospects. For instance, adolescent risk taking is often associated with poor grades
and school dropout. How consequential these choices are ultimately hinges on the extent of inequality. In countries where unemployment is low, the income distribution
is equal, and where there exist social safety nets and second opportunities, the risk
associated with making poor choices during adolescence is limited. In contrast, early
mistakes tend to be more detrimental in societies where adult success hinges on being
admitted to good schools, and where the return to education is high. While parents may
try to counteract risk-taking behavior by making their children more forward-looking,
another natural intervention is to increase the children’s wariness of risk. Monitoring
children to ensure they stay away from dangerous activities is another option.
6.1 Environment
To focus sharply on the risk dimension, we both extend and specialize the model of
Section 5. In particular, we focus on juvenile risk, while abstracting from other dimensions of physical and human capital investment. As in the previous section, the income
realization can be either high, yH (success), or low, yL (failure). To focus on risk preferences separately from time preferences, we consider lotteries that affect success in the
first period only, whereas income in the adult period is exogenous. Allowing persistent
effects would combine the effects analyzed in the previous section with the risk dimension that is the focus here. To simplify the analysis we also abstract from savings, and
we continue to set the cost of parental investments to zero.
Preferences are parameterized by a von Neumann-Morgenstern expected utility function inducing a constant relative risk aversion (CRRA). The child’s felicity is given by:
[

]
c1−a − 1
,
U (c|a) = E
1−a
y

with the usual convention that U y (c|1) = log (c). The child’s risk aversion is endogenous
and is given by a = a′ ∈ [0, ∞). Here, ā = 0, so that a higher a′ implies a higher risk
aversion, and at the bliss point preference ā adolescents are risk neutral. Parents are risk
averse, i.e., a = σ > 0.37 Their higher innate risk aversion leads them to disagree with
37

Note that, contrary to the case of patience, parental preferences here affect incentives for preference
transmission. More risk averse parents will worry more about the risk-taking of their children, and are

37

their children about the choice of lotteries. A useful property of CRRA utility is that,
for any given c, U y (c|a) is decreasing in a. This conveniently captures the notion that
risk aversion makes people fearful and less disposed to enjoy life. Therefore, altruistic
parents will suffer a cost from making their children risk averse. If parents opt, nevertheless, to turn them risk averse, it is because of their paternalistic drive to distort their
choice of lotteries (as shown in Proposition A.2).
The parent’s value function can be written as:
v o = max
{uo (co ) + δw (X, a′ )} ,
′
a ,X∈X

where
w (X, a′ ) = Es′ [(1 − λ) U y (C y (x, s′ )|a′ ) + λU o (C y (x, s′ )) + βv o ] .
The exogenous consumption of parents co will be ignored below since it does not affect
any parenting choice.
We assume that adolescents can choose between two lotteries: x ∈ X F REE = {xJ , xN }.
The lottery xN (no juvenile risk) yields a safe income yH . The lottery xJ (juvenile risk)
yields an additional utility that is assumed to be multiplicative in the consumption level.
However, it is risky: youngsters engaging in juvenile risk are successful (yH ) with probability pJ ∈ (0, 1), and unsuccessful (yL ) with probability 1 − pJ .
6.2 Authoritative versus Permissive Parenting
We now consider the case where parents cannot monitor the choice of lotteries, but can
influence risk aversion through an authoritative parenting style. The child’s value function is given by:
v y (a′ ) =

max

x∈{xJ ,xN }

{Es′ [U y (C y (x, s′ )|a′ ) + βv o ]} ,

where

therefore more likely to mold their children as risk averse. If we assume that the preferences of the young
persist, the theory can feature path dependence (see Doepke and Zilibotti 2013). Here, we abstract from
this source of persistence by assuming, for simplicity, that the risk aversion of the old is exogenous.

38

Here, ψ > 1 captures the thrill associated with taking the risky juvenile lottery.
The optimal choice of x hinges on the endogenous risk aversion parameter a′ . We assume parameters to be such that children rank the three possible outcomes as follows:
first, success and juvenile activities; next, success and no juvenile activities (safe option);
last, failure and juvenile activities. Choosing xJ yields a lottery between the most and
the least desired outcome. The standard properties of von Neumann-Morgenstern utility imply that, for any risk aversion, there exists a value pJ = PJ (a′ ) for the probability
of success that makes the decision maker indifferent between the juvenile and the safe
lottery. The indifference condition between the two lotteries can be written as:
ψ − ψa
PJ (a′ ) = 1 −

We can establish the following intuitive property:
Lemma 6.1. PJ (a′ ) is an increasing function of risk aversion a′ . Hence, there exists a range of
probabilities pJ such that a more risk averse child chooses xJ over xN , whereas a less risk averse
child chooses xN over xJ .
Since PJ is monotonic, it admits an inverse function, PJ−1 (pj ) ≡ A (pJ , yH /yL ), where A
is increasing in pJ and decreasing in yH /yL . The function A (pJ , yH /yL ) gives the degree
of risk aversion a′ that makes the child indifferent between the two lotteries, and hence
the minimum level of risk aversion the parent has to endow the child with to induce
the child to take the safe choice. To focus on the interesting case, we restrict attention
to parameter values pJ , yH , and yL that fulfill the inequality 0 < â ≡ A (pJ , yH /yL ) < σ.
This guarantees that parents prefer the safe lottery, while risk-neutral children would
take the juvenile lottery.
Now consider the parent’s choice between an authoritative and a permissive parenting
style. An authoritative parent sets a′ = â, while a permissive parent sets a′ = 0.38 A
(

(
)
parent chooses to be permissive if w X F REE , 0 ≥ w X F REE , â , and to be authoritative
38
To see why, recall that, with CRRA utility, a higher risk aversion reduces cardinal utility for any given
choice. Thus, it would be sub-optimal to choose a′ > â. Likewise, no parent would choose a′ ∈ (0, â), as
in this range the child would take the juvenile risk, in which case setting a′ = 0 is always better.

The choice of parenting style hinges on λ: higher paternalism induces a more intrusive
parenting style. Moreover, the range of λ inducing a permissive parenting style shrinks
as inequality increases. The following proposition formally states this result (the proof
is omitted).40
Proposition 6.1. There exists a λJ (pJ , yH /yL ) such that all parents with λ ≥ λJ (pJ , yH /yL )
are authoritative while all parents with λ ≤ λJ (pJ , yH /yL ) are permissive. λJ is increasing in
pJ and decreasing in yH /yL .
6.3 Helicopter Parents
So far, we have considered the margin between permissive and authoritative parenting.
We now extend the analysis to authoritarian strategies. To this aim, suppose that there
exists a second risky lottery (henceforth, the small lottery ) denoted by x̃J that entails
less risk but also delivers less fun than the juvenile lottery. This lottery is assumed to be
a mean-preserving compression of the juvenile lottery, i.e., it delivers the same expected
income with a lower variance. More formally, we denote by ỹH < yH and ỹL > yL the
realizations of the small lottery, where we have:
yH − ỹH
1 − pJ
=
.
ỹL − yL
pJ
Here, pJ is the probability of success of both the juvenile and the small lottery (assumed,
for simplicity, to be the same). The small lottery delivers an extra utility ψ̃ < ψ such that
39

Note that we assume that the thrill ψ enters the utility of both altruistic and paternalistic parents,
being essentially part of consumption. This modeling strategy emphasizes that risk is the only source
of disagreement. One could alternatively assume that ψ only enters the altruistic component of w. In
this case, parents and children would also disagree on the evaluation of the thrill embedded in juvenile
activities. This source of additional disagreement would strengthen our results.
40
It is interesting to observe that, ceteris paribus, more inequality turns children themselves to be less
prone to risk taking. Formally, A (pJ , yH /yL ) is decreasing in yH /yL , implying that parents’ interventions
can succeed even if they are less intensive. Arguably, this is in line with the casual observation that in
today’s more unequal societies the young generation tends to be more conservative and oriented towards
individual success (although part of this observation can relate to parents’ interventions).

40

ψyH > ψ̃ ỹH > yH > ψ̃ ỹL > ψyL . We also assume that
ψ (pJ yH + (1 − pJ )yL ) > ψ̃ (pJ ỹH + (1 − pJ )ỹL ) > yH ,
i.e., a risk neutral child prefers the juvenile over the small lottery, and the small over the
safe lottery.
The new authoritarian element is that parents can prevent children from taking the small
lottery by monitoring them at no cost. In contrast, parents cannot monitor the juvenile
lottery. Hence, parents can choose between the choice sets X F REE = {xJ , x̃J , xN } and
X HELICOP T ER = {xJ , xN }. With this in mind, parenting boils down to choosing between
three strategies:41
1. Allow children to take the juvenile lottery (permissive parenting style).
2. Induce children to decline the juvenile lottery but let children take the small lottery
(authoritative parenting style).
3. Take no chance: mold the children’s preferences so that they decline the juvenile
lottery, and monitor that they reject the small lottery (helicopter parenting).
Figure 6.1 displays the optimal parenting style as function of paternalism and inequality
(parameterized as proportional shift in the variances of both risky lotteries).42 The range
of λ for which parents are permissive is decreasing in inequality (or risk). For very
low risk, all parents are permissive. For moderate risk, there is a threshold for λ such
that parents with a degree of paternalism above the threshold are authoritative (i.e.,
they endow their children with sufficient risk aversion to avoid the juvenile lottery)
but they still allow their children to take the small lottery. Next, for high risk, low-λ
parents continue to be permissive, intermediate-λ parents are authoritative, and highλ parents are helicopter parents, i.e., they forbid even small lotteries. Finally, for very
41

In order to avoid the small risk, parents could in principle choose X F REE and increase the child’s risk
aversion so much that she declines both lotteries. However, under our assumptions this option is always
dominated by setting a′ = â and restricting the choice set to X HELICOP T ER , as this yields a larger utility
while inducing the same choice of lotteries. Similarly, a parent could in principle be only authoritarian,
but this is also a dominated strategy because the child would then choose the juvenile lottery.
42
The parameter values are σ = 2, ψJ = 1.5, ψ̃J = 1.33, pJ = 0.75, and E (xJ ) = 1.75. In Figure 6.1,
inequality on the horizontal axis refers to the ratio yH /yL for the juvenile lottery. The relative riskiness of
the small and juvenile lotteries is held constant as inequality varies, namely, ỹH /ỹL = 0.4yH /yL .

large risk, parents are either permissive or helicopter parents. The range of helicopter
parents increases with inequality.
In summary, the theory yields predictions that are consistent with the recent rise in helicopter parenting, comprising both an increase in moral suasion aimed to deter children
from taking gambles, and direct monitoring to avoid even small risks.43

7 Conclusions
In this paper, we construct a formal rational-choice theory that accounts for the emergence of different parenting styles as equilibrium outcomes driven by economic incentives. We apply our general model to the intergenerational transmission of patience and
of risk aversion. The theory yields predictions for how the economic environment determines the prevalence of different parenting styles. In particular, it is consistent with
historical evidence that authoritarian parenting declines as economic development advances. Moreover, it is consistent with evidence that in the industrialized world parents
in low-inequality countries are more permissive and emphasize values such as independence and imagination, whereas in high-inequality countries parents place more stock
in hard work, a value typically associated with an authoritative parenting style. Re43

In our example, the only cost of being a helicopter parent is merely a utility loss for the child. However, it is easy to extend the model and show that when children are turned more risk averse, they may
also reject risky lotteries with an upper tail, like entrepreneurial activities, see Doepke and Zilibotti (2013).

42

turns to education and redistributive policies also affect the choice of parenting style in
a way that lines up well with the evidence. Finally, the theory predicts that a combination of high inequality, weak safety nets, and strong paternalism can explain the rise of
helicopter parents, a salient trend of parenting style in the United States in recent years.
The theory can be extended in a number of directions. For instance, one could allow for
endogenous fertility decisions and study the interaction of family size and parenting;
less time-intensive parenting styles should be more attractive when the number of children is large. The theory could also be applied to the transmission of social preferences.
Parents’ incentives to teach pro-social behavior should vary with the extent to which
such behavior (and its opposite, i.e., opportunistic behavior) is rewarded in society. In
addition, one could let the degree of paternalism result from an evolutionary process.44
Our analysis suggests that there is no golden rule about the fitness of paternalistic preferences. In our application to patience, paternalism has high fitness, as it induces human
capital accumulation, contributing to the economic success of paternalistic dynasties. In
the application to risk preferences, parental paternalism reduces risk-taking and protects
children from juvenile risk, but may also stifle entrepreneurship. Therefore, the success
of paternalistic families depends on the preference trait, the economic environment, and
the stage of economic development.
One could also consider self-reinforcing mechanisms that operate through general equilibrium effects. In earlier work, we study the interaction among preference transmission, innovation, and growth (see Doepke and Zilibotti 2013). In ongoing work with
Giuseppe Sorrenti, we consider the two-way link between neighborhood characteristics
and the choice of parenting style. One could go even further and study how parenting style feeds back into the determination of policies, institutions, and social norms.
Finally, one could study how changes in parenting styles have contributed to magnify
inequality in the recent half century. Such extensions are left to future research.

A Technical Appendix
A.1 The General Model of Section 4
In this section, we formalize properties of the general model discussed in the text, and provide a
characterization of the first-order conditions for the differentiable case.
A.1.1 Some General Properties
In this section, we formalize the discussion in the last paragraph of Section 4.2.
We introduce two simplifying assumptions. The first is a simple tie-break rule for the choice of
X.
Assumption 1. If the parent is indifferent between two or more choice sets, she chooses the largest possible
one.
Given that the child always prefers a larger choice set, this amounts to respecting the preference
of the child if the parent is indifferent.
The second assumption is that there exists a particular preference vector a = ā such that for
given c, the period utility is maximized in a cardinal sense. Moreover, this is the least costly
choice of a′ . We interpret ā as the children’s natural inclination. Letting this inclination prevail
is less costly for parents than molding their preferences.
Assumption 2. There exists a unique ā ∈ A such that for all a, a′ ∈ A, h ∈ H and s ∈ S, and for all
feasible c:
U o (c|ā) ≥ U o (c|a) ,
( )
U y (c|ā) ≥ U y c|a′ ,
e(X, ā|h, s) ≤ e(X, a′ |h, s).
In a more general model, parents may wish to mold their children’s preferences in order to
increase their cardinal utility (e.g., by increasing their overall appreciation of life). In part, Assumption 2 can be regarded as a normalization of utility, in the sense that utility and effort cost
are defined relative to a point where mutually beneficial investments in improving cardinal utility have already been carried out. The assumption is restrictive in the sense that the same bliss
point ā is assumed to apply to utility in both young and old age and that young and old agree
on this bliss point, which simplifies the analysis.
We can now state some general propositions.

1

Proposition A.1. If λ = 0, then the parent is neither authoritarian nor authoritative.
Proof Suppose, to derive a contradiction, that a∗ ̸= ā, i.e., the parent is authoritative. Then
optimality of the choice of a∗ implies that the following inequality should hold:
[

(
)
− e (X , a |h, s) + δEs′ U y C y (x (X ∗ , a∗ ) , s′ )|a∗
∗

∗

( (
)
)
+ β U o C o (H(x (X ∗ , a∗ ) , s′′ )|a∗ − e(X ′′ , a′′ |H(x (X ∗ , a∗ ) , s′ ), s′ ) + δw(X ′′ , a′′∗ )
[
(
)
∗
≥ −e (X , ā|h, s) + δEs′ U y C y (x (X ∗ , a∗ ) , s′ )|ā

]

]
( (
)
)
+ β U o C o (H(x (X ∗ , a∗ ) , s′′ )|ā − e(X ′′ , a′′ |H(x (X ∗ , a∗ ) , s′ ), s′ ) + δw(X ′′ , a′′ |ā) ,
where X ′′ and a′′ denote the optimal choices in the next period, given that a′ = a∗ and X ′∗ are
chosen today. Now notice that with λ = 0 we have w(X ′′ , a′′ |ā) = w(X ′′ , a′′∗ ), that is, the parent’s
preference parameter does not directly enter the utility derived from children. Canceling equal
terms, we therefore have:
∗

∗

[

∗ ∗

≥ −e (X , ā|h, s) + δEs′ U C (x (X , a ) , s )|ā + βU C (H(x (X , a ) , s )|ā .

This inequality contradicts Assumption 2 which implies ā is the unique preference parameter
that maximizes the expression on the right-hand side. We therefore have obtained a contradiction, and must conclude that a∗ = ā, so that parents cannot behave authoritatively. A similar
argument establishes that purely altruistic parents do not behave in an authoritarian fashion. 2
Proposition A.2. Suppose λ ∈ (0, 1). If the parent is authoritarian and X̃ is a feasible choice set such
(
)
(
)
that X ∗ ⊂ X̃ and e(X ∗ , a∗ |h, s) > e(X̃, a′ |h, s), then we have cy , x, h′ |X ∗ , a∗ ̸= cy , x, h′ |X̃, a∗ .
Likewise, if the parent is authoritative and e(X ∗ , a∗ |h, s) ≥ e(X ∗ , ā|h, s), then it must be the case that
( y
) (
)
c , x, h′ |X ∗ , a∗ ̸= cy , x, h′ |X ∗ , ā .
Proof Note that
v o (a, h, s) = U o (co |a) − e (X ∗ , a∗ |h, s) + δv y (X ∗ , a∗ )
[ (
)
(
)]
+ δ (1 − λ) Es′ U o C y (x (X ∗ , a∗ ) , s′ )|a − U y C y (x (X ∗ , a∗ ) , s′ )|a∗ . (9)

2

Consider the first part of the proposition. Note that, since (X ∗ , a∗ ) is the optimal choice, then:
− e (X ∗ , a∗ |h, s) + δv y (X ∗ , a∗ )
[ (
)
(
)]
+ δ (1 − λ) Es′ U o C y (x (X ∗ , a∗ ) , s′ )|a − U y C y (x (X ∗ , a∗ ) , s′ )|a∗
≥ −e(X̃, a∗ |h, s) + δv y (X̃, a∗ )
[ (
)
(
)]
+ δ (1 − λ) Es′ U o C y (x(X̃, a∗ ), s′ )|a − U y C y (x(X̃, a∗ ), s′ )|a∗ .
Suppose, to derive a contradiction, that C y (x(X ∗ , a∗ ), s′ ) = C y (x(X̃, a∗ ), s′ ). Then, the expression above can be rewritten as:
(
)
e(X̃, a∗ |h, s) − e(X ∗ , a∗ |h, s) + δ v y (X ∗ , a∗ ) − v y (X̃, a∗ ) ≥ 0.
However, this is impossible since (i) e(X ∗ , a∗ |h, s) > e(X̃, a′ |h, s) (by assumption), and because
(ii) v y (X ∗ , a∗ ) ≤ v y (X̃, a∗ ) since we assume that X ∗ ⊂ X̃. A contradiction.
Consider the second part of the proposition. Note that, since a∗ is the optimal choice, we have
[
− e (X ∗ , a∗ |h, s) + δEs′ (1 − λ) U y (C y (x (X ∗ , a∗ ) |a∗ )
(
)]
+ λU o (C y (x (X ∗ , a∗ ) |a) + βv o a∗ , H(x(X ∗ , a∗ ), s′′
[
≥ −e (X ∗ , ā|h, s) + δEs′ (1 − λ) U y (C y (x (X ∗ , ā) |ā)
(
)]
+ λU o (C y (x (X ∗ , ā) |a) + βv o ā, H(x(X ∗ , ā), s′′ .
Now, to derive a contradiction, let C y (x (X ∗ , a∗ ) = C y (x (X ∗ , ā) and x(X ∗ , a∗ ), s′ ) = x(X ∗ , ā), s′ ).
The expression can then be rewritten as:
[
]
e (X ∗ , ā|h, s) − e (X ∗ , a∗ |h, s) + δ(1 − λ)Es′ U y (C y (x (X ∗ , a∗ ) |a∗ ) − U y (C y (x (X ∗ , ā) |ā)
[ (
)
(
)]
+ λβEs′ v o a∗ , H(x(X ∗ , a∗ ), s′′ − v o ā, H(x(X ∗ , ā), s′′ ≥ 0.
However, given the condition stated in the proposition the first term is non-positive, and ā is (by
Assumption 2) the unique maximizer of U y and U o (which enters in v o ), so that the remaining
2

expression is negative, giving a contradiction.
Proposition A.3. If the optimal X is a singleton, then the parent is not authoritative.
Proof The result follows immediately from Proposition A.2

2

Proposition A.4. If the optimal a′ is such that U y (c|a′ ) = U o (c|a), then the parent is not authoritarian.

3

Proof If U y (c|a∗ ) = U o (c|a), then equation (9) above simplifies to
v o (a, h, s) = U o (co |a) − e (X ∗ , a∗ |h, s) + δv y (X ∗ , a∗ ).
Suppose, to derive a contradiction, that the parent is authoritarian, i.e., there exists an X̃ ∈ X
such that v y (X ∗ , a∗ ) < v y (X̃, a∗ ) and e (X ∗ , a∗ |h, s) ≥ e(X̃, a∗ |h, s). The optimality of X ∗ , a∗
implies:
−e (X ∗ , a∗ |h, s) + δv y (X ∗ , a∗ ) ≥ −e(X̃, a∗ |h, s) + δv y (X̃, a∗ ).
Since v y (X ∗ , a∗ ) < v y (X̃, a∗ ), we get that:
e (X ∗ , a∗ |h, s) < e(X̃, a∗ |h, s).
However, this contradicts the condition e (X ∗ , a∗ |h, s) ≥ e(X̃, a∗ |h, s).

2

A.1.2 The Differentiable Case
In this section, we provide characterization for the differentiable case. Suppose that U o and
U y are continuous, twice differentiable, and concave in c. In addition, suppose that all choice
4

and state variables are unidimensional, i.e., [c, h, x, a] ∈ (R+ ) . We introduce the following
assumptions.
Assumption 3. The set X (h, s) can be expressed as X (h, s) = {X (h, s, r) |r ∈ [0, 1]}, where for any
r, r̃ such that r̃ > r, X(h, s, r) ⊂ X(h, s, r̃).
Assumption 4. The function e is separable, namely, e(X (h, s, r) , a′ |h, s) = er (r|h, s) + eA (a′ |h, s),
where er and eA are twice differentiable convex functions of r and a′ , respectively, with minima at r̄ and
ā.
The decision problem of choosing a′ and r can now be written as:
o

v (a, h, s) =

max

a′ ∈A,r∈[0,1]

{
U o (C o (h, s)|a) − er (r|h, s) − eA (a′ |h, s)

If the child’s choice of x is interior, the first-order condition for her problem yields:

+ βvho ′ a′ , H(x r, a′ , s′ ), s′ Hx (x r, a′ , s′ ) = 0.

Consider now the parent’s choice of a′ . If the optimal choice of a′ is interior and the function
x (r, a′ ) is differentiable at the optimum, the first-order condition yields:

Two cases are possible here. First, if xa′ (r, a′ ) = 0 at the optimal choice of a′ , the parent sets:
[ y ( y ( ′ ) ′ ′ )]
[ (
(

)]

eA

a′ (a |h, s) = δ (1 − λ) Es′ Ua′ C (x r, a , s )|a

(10)

In this case, the optimal choice is to set a′ = ā. To see why, note that Assumption 2 implies that

(i) eA
a′ (a |h, s) is minimized at ā, and that (ii) U (c , s )|a ) and v (a , h ) are maximized at ā. The

case of xa′ (r, a′ ) = 0 covers the possibilities that X (h, s, r) is a singleton and that the child’s
choice is at a corner.
The second case is when xa′ (r, a′ ) ̸= 0 at the optimal choice of a′ . In this case, the first-order
condition of the child holds with equality. Then, applying the envelope theorem yields:

Consider now some special cases. First, if λ = 0 (pure altruism), then the solution is again
given by equation (10), so that parents set a′ = ā. If λ = 1 (pure paternalism), setting a′ = ā is
generally not optimal as long as xa′ (r, a′ ) ̸= 0. Purely paternalistic parents are especially prone
to distort their children’s choice, because they disregard the utility cost that children suffer when
preferences are molded away from the natural inclination.

5

Consider, next, the choice of r. There are two possible cases. First, suppose that the optimal r
does not bind the child’s choice. Namely, there exists an interval [r′ , r′′ ] with r′ < r < r′′ such
that x (r, a) takes on the same value for any r ∈ [r′ , r′′ ]. In this case the choice of x is independent
of r in a neighborhood of the optimum, and the parent sets r = r̄.45 Second, suppose that r
does constrain the child’s choice, i.e., there does not exist an interval around the optimal r where
the child’s choice is constant. In this case (generically), the parent sets r ̸= r̄. If, in addition, the
policy function x (r, a′ ) is differentiable at the optimum, then a necessary condition for optimality
is:

The parent trades off the effort cost associated with choosing r ̸= r̄ with the benefits of expanding
or restricting the choice set. Even though the lifetime utility of the child is decreasing in r, a
paternalistic parent may still gain from restricting the child’s choice set by increasing r. If λ = 0,
the altruistic parent will never spend effort to restrict the choice set, as stated in Proposition A.1
above, but may choose to expand the child’s choice set to increase her utility. Conversely, if
λ = 1, the parent may choose to expand or restrict the choice set so as to better align the child’s
choice with the parent’s preferences. An authoritarian behavior requires (i) that the parent be
paternalistic and (ii) that actively restricting the child’s choice set increases the utility the parent
derives from the child’s choices.

where the last equality follows from replacing xe (a′ ) by its expression in (5). Substituting xe (a′ ),
cy (xe (a′ )), and cya′ (xe (a′ ) into (6) and rearranging terms yields (7).
Notice that the lemma only states a necessary condition for an optimum. For a given interior solution satisfying (6) to be a local maximum, one must also check that the second-order condition
holds. In particular, let:

(
)
(
)1 1
Q a′ , R = λ a′ − 1  ′
σa

Then, the second-order conditions require that

< 0 for the value of a′ that satisfies (6)

with equality. As long as a′ > 1 the marginal benefit is decreasing in a′ everywhere, and the
local optimum is unique. In particular, the condition ∂Q (a′ , R) /∂a′ < 0 must be true at the
2

global optimum.

Proof of Lemma 5.2: The right-hand side of (7) is negative for λ = 0, implying that a′ = ā for
λ = 0 and, by continuity, also for a range of λ sufficiently close to zero. At λ = 1, the second
term in (7) is zero, and the condition can be satisfied only by setting a′ = 1, so that the first term
2

is zero as well.

ā
, the right-hand side of (7) is negative for
Proof of Proposition 5.1: First note that if λ ≤ σ ā−(1−σ)

ā
any a′ and R. Hence, the inequality is strict and we must have a′ = ā. For the case λ > σ ā−(1−σ)
,

the threshold R̄ results from setting a′ = ā and then equating the right-hand side of (7) to zero.

Hence, if R = R̄ condition (7) holds as an equality at a′ = ā, so that a′ = ā is optimal. For R < R̄,
at a′ = ā the right-hand side of (7) is negative, so that we are at the corner solution and a′ = ā
is optimal as well. For R > R̄, notice that the right-hand side of (7) is strictly decreasing in R,
which implies that the optimal a is strictly decreasing in R also in this range. Finally, when R
goes to infinity, the right-hand side of (7) converges to λ (a′ − 1) /σa′ − (1 − λ) / (1 − σ). Setting
this expression equal to zero implies that ā∗ = limR→∞ a∗ = λ (1 − σ) / (λ − σ).

Proof of Proposition 5.2: The results for the choice between authoritative and permissive parenting in the region µ ≤ µ̂(R) follow from Proposition 5.1. Here we need to establish that there

7

exists a function µ̂(R) that satisfies 0 < µ̂(R) ≤ µ̄ and such that authoritarian parenting is optimal for µ ≥ µ̂(R). Consider the case µ = µ̄. We have:
(

)
.

Since under an authoritarian style the choices of a′ and x̄ are optimal from the parent’s perspective, we have:

(
)
(
)
w̃ X HOM E , ā ≥ w̃ X F REE , a∗ .

Now consider the case λ = 0. Then, the argument in the text implies that a∗ = ā and xe (ā) = x̄e .
Hence, we have:
(

)

y 1−σ
w̃ X HOM E , ā = H

(1 + Rx̄e )1−σ
(1 − x̄e )1−σ
+β

)

(
)
= w̃ X F REE , ā .

Thus, the parent is indifferent between being authoritarian and granting freedom to the child, so
that µ̂(R) = µ̄ for all R when λ = 0. Similarly, consider the case λ = 1. Then, the argument in the
text implies that a∗ = 1 and e (1) = x̄e , so that we have:
(

w̃ X

y 1−σ

(

(1 − x̄e )1−σ
(1 + Rx̄e )1−σ

)

(
)
= w̃ X F REE , 1 .

Thus, for λ = 1 we have µ̂(R) = µ̄ for all R as well. Finally, consider interior levels of paternal(
)
(
)
ism, λ ∈ (0, 1). Then, xe (a∗ ) = x̄e , implying that w̃ X HOM E , ā > w̃ X F REE , a∗ , since x̄e is
chosen optimally, whereas xe (a∗ ) is distorted from the parent’s perspective. In particular, if the
parent is permissive, as long as R > 0 we have:
(

(

since xe (ā) < x̄e , and x̄e is by definition optimal. A similar argument applies if the parent is
authoritative (in this case the cost for the parent has two components: the child’s lower effort and

8

the child’s lower felicity. To summarize, when λ ∈ (0, 1), the parents prefer to be authoritarian
at µ = µ̄, so that we must have µ̂(R) < µ̄. In the case R = 0, we have a∗ = ā and xe (ā) = x̄e = 0,
(
)
(
)
thus w̃ X HOM E , ā = w̃ X F REE , ā . For the case λ ∈ (0, 1) and R > 0 , the existence of a
µ̂(R) ∈ (0, µ̄) that yields indifference between authoritarian parenting and granting freedom
to the child follows because the utility of granting freedom is positive and independent of µ,
whereas the utility of being authoritarian is strictly increasing in µ and converges to zero as µ
approaches zero. Moreover, for µ > µ̂, the proof implies a fortiori that authoritarian parenting is
strictly optimal for all λ ∈ [0, 1].

2

Proof of Proposition 5.4: For high-skill parents, the argument of Proposition 5.2 applies (note,
in particular, that µ̂(R) is the same). For low-skill parents, the only margin is permissive vs.
authoritarian. If either µ ≤ µ̂(R) and R ≤ R̄, or λ ≤ σā/ (ā − (1 − σ)) (or both), then µ̂(R) =
µ̂L (R) since authoritative parenting is an irrelevant alternative even for high-skill parents. Thus,
along the relevant margin high- and low-skill parents face the same problem. Next, we establish
that, in the range where λ > σā/ (ā − (1 − σ)) and R > R̄, there exists a µ̂L (R) function such that
0 < µ̂L (R) ≤ µ̂(R), and such that low-skill parents prefer authoritarian parenting for µ ≥ µ̂L (R)
and permissive parenting otherwise. Suppose, first that µ = µ̂(R). Then, by the definition
of µ̂(R), parents are indifferent between an authoritative and an authoritarian parenting style.
Moreover, since R > R̄, parents strictly prefer to be authoritative than permissive. Thus, at
µ = µ̂(R), parents (including low-skill ones) strictly prefer being authoritarian than permissive.
Hence, low-skill parents choose to be authoritarian in this range. Second, if µ = 0, parents strictly
prefer being permissive than authoritarian. Hence, low-skill parents choose to be authoritarian
for a range of low µ. Continuity establishes, then, that there there exists µ̂L (R) ∈ [0, µ̂ (R)] such
that low-skill parents prefer authoritarian parenting for µ ≥ µ̂L (R) and permissive parenting
2

otherwise.
Proof of Lemma 6.1: We note first that, for all z > 0, the function
F (z) =

ln z
−1

zξ

(11)

has the following properties: F (z) > 0 if ξ > 0, F (z) < 0 if ξ < 0, F ′ (z) < 0 for all ξ ̸= 0. To see
why F ′ (z) < 0, note that
′

(
)
z ξ 1 − ln z ξ − 1

(12)

z (z ξ − 1)
(
)
(
)
where z ξ 1 − ln z ξ < 1 for all z < 1 and z ξ 1 − ln z ξ = 1 for z = 1. The denominator is positive
F (z) =

for all z ̸= 1. The numerator is always negative for z ̸= 1 and equal to zero at z = 1. Since as
z → 1 both the numerator and the denominator tend to zero, we apply the L’Hôpital Theorem

9

and obtain:
lim

(
)
z ξ 1 − ln z ξ − 1
z (z ξ

This establishes that F ′ (z) < 0 for all z > 0.
Next, observe that:

where both

are of the form F as in (11).

We break down the analysis into two cases. First, suppose that a < 1. Then, both terms are
negative. Turn the two terms positive by pre-multiplying by minus one:
( )

where, recall, ψ <

The inequality follows then from the properties of the function F in (11),

Next, suppose a > 1. Then, both terms are positive. In this case, we must show that

The last inequality follows again from the properties of the function F in (11).

“to obey” among the top two values that are important for children to learn, from a list that includes
“to obey,” “to be popular and well liked,” “to think for oneself,” “to work hard,” and “to help others.”
Answers are averaged over five-year intervals.

prepare him or her for life?” The respondents are also asked for their second, third, and fourth
priority on the list. The possible answers include “to obey,” “to be popular and well liked,” “to
think for oneself,” “to work hard,” and “to help others.” In line with our classification of the
parenting questions in the WVS, we can identify the quality “to obey” with an authoritarian
parenting style, and “to work hard” with an authoritative parenting style.
Figure B.2 and Figure B.3 display the fraction of respondents listing “to obey” and “to work
hard” among the top two desired child qualities. The data cover the period 1986 to 2014 and are
broken down by the education of the respondent. The results are consistent with the trends documented in the main text. Obedience is valued more highly by respondents with less education,
and across education group this value is met with declining approval over time, corresponding
to a decline in authoritarian parenting. At the same time, there is a strong upward trend (in
all education groups) in the emphasis on “hard work,” consistent with a rise in authoritative or
“helicopter” parenting.

B.4 Class Differences in Parenting Style in the NLSY
The NLSY 1997 data discussed in Section 3.4 can also be used to examine class differences in
parenting style. In Section 3.3, we have already established (using time use data and GSS data
on the approval of corporal punishment) that in recent decades in the United States, the authoritarian style (proxied by approval of corporal punishment) is more prevalent among individuals with less education, whereas the authoritative style (proxied by time-intensive parenting) is
more prevalent among those with more education. The NLSY data leads to the same conclusions. Table B.3 provides a breakdown of mothers’ and father’s parenting styles by education of
the parent, based on 1998 data on parenting style of residential parents.46 We find that for both
mothers and fathers, authoritarian and neglecting parenting is most prevalent for those with the
lowest education level (up to high school), and authoritative parenting is most common among
parents with advanced degrees (master, Ph.D., or professional degree).
46

We use the 1998 parenting style here because data on degrees earned by the parents are not available
for 1997. However, combining the parenting style measured in 1997 with degree information in 1998 leads
to similar results.

Based on 1998 parenting style of residential parents in NLSY 1997 data set (no. of observations: 4,422 for
mothers, 3,209 for fathers). The table shows the proportion of parents adopting each of the four parenting
style in 1998, broken down by the education level of parents.

Table B.4 and B.5 provide results for multinomial logit regressions that also control for the parent’s age, age squared, and race and ethnicity controls. Even after introducing additional controls, parents with completed higher education (bachelor’s degree or higher) have a substantially
lower likelihood of being neglecting parents, and correspondingly large and highly significant
RRRs for the other three parenting styles (neglecting is the reference category). Moreover, the
strongest impact is that of having an advanced degree on the RRR of authoritative relative to
neglecting parenting, with values in excess of 5.0 for both mothers and fathers.
