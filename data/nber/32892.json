    "abstract": "\n\nWe examine student, teacher, and peer perceptions of effort, ability, performance, and self-confidence in Romania\u2019s highly tracked schools. We find that: (1) students just above a cutoff\u2014tracked into high-achieving classes\u2014have less favorable self-perceptions than those just below (\u201cbig-fish-little-pond\u201d effects); (2) students perceive peers in their classes more favorably (\u201cin-group bias\u201d); (3) this bias is stronger in lower-achieving classes; (4) students perceive themselves more positively than others perceive them (\u201cillusory superiority\u201d); (5) this bias is stronger among lower-achieving students (\u201cKrueger-Dunning effects\u201d). In short, being tracked into lower-achieving classes does not appear to negatively affect self-perceptions.\n\n",
