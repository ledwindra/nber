Vanishing Third World Emigrants?
Timothy J. Hatton and Jeffrey G. Williamson
NBER Working Paper No. 14785
March 2009
JEL No. F22,J1,O15
ABSTRACT
This paper documents a stylized fact not well appreciated in the literature. The Third World has been
undergoing an emigration life cycle since the 1960s, and, except for Africa, emigration rates have
been level or even declining since a peak in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. The current economic
crisis will serve only to accelerate those trends. The paper estimates the economic and demographic
fundamentals driving these Third World emigration life cycles to the United States since 1970 – the
income gap between the US and the sending country, the education gap between the US and the sending
country, the poverty trap, the size of the cohort at risk, and migrant stock dynamics. It then projects
the life cycle up to 2024. The projections imply that pressure on Third World emigration over the next
two decades will not increase. It also suggests that future US immigrants will be more African and
less Hispanic than in the past.

Country-Specific Emigration Life-Cycles

The academic literature and media reporting is written as if the rate of Third
World mass migration will increase indefinitely, at least after the current recession. It is
also written from the perspective of the host country demand side, ignoring the sending
country supply side, as if that supply is perfectly elastic and will remain so indefinitely.
Thus, Lant Pritchett tells us that “there are five irresistible forces in the global economy
creating growing pressures for greater movement of labor … from poorer to richer
countries” (2006: 138). Such statements like Pritchett’s imply that immigration rates into
high-wage host countries – unless checked by tougher immigration policy or by another
great depression – will rise to ever-increasing heights as the economic gap between them
and the sending countries remains large, as the industrialized world ages, as its share of
working native-born adults shrinks, and as the demand for additional foreign-born young
adults soars to fill the gap. History strongly suggests the contrary, and it also suggests
that analysts should pay much more attention to the supply side.

Immigration vs Emigration: Denominators Matter
To begin with, we need to shed our conventional Euro-centric and Americancentric instincts and look at the problem from the point view of the Third World. That is,
in calculating migration rates let us begin by replacing the receiving country population
or labor force in the denominator with the sending country population or labor force.
After all, the growth rate of the former has been slowing down since the post-war baby
boom, and in some countries, like Italy and Japan, native-born population growth is fast

3

approaching zero or even negative rates. Under these demographic conditions, even
constant emigration rates would yield rising immigration rates. In the denominator, when
host country populations – growing so slow at the end of their demographic transition –
are replaced by sending country populations – growing so fast in the middle of their
demographic transition, Third World emigration rates are capable of tracing out quite
different patterns than those of high-wage host country immigration rates. Indeed, as we
shall see below, they trace out what we have called elsewhere country-specific
emigration life cycles (1998: Chp. 3; 2005: Chps. 1 and 4), and they often offer leading
indicators for what to expect regarding immigration rates.

European Pre-1914 Emigration Life Cycles
Country-specific emigration life cycles across the long 19th century make it clear
that real wage or income per capita gaps will not by themselves explain emigration:
during the course of modern economic growth in Europe, country emigration rates rose
steeply at first from very low levels, after which the rise began to slow down as the
emigration rates climbed to a peak, and subsequently they fell. This life cycle stylized
fact has emerged from study after study, both for aggregate time series of country
emigration rates and for regional emigration rates within countries (Gould 1979; Hatton
and Williamson 2005: Chp. 4).
Several explanations have been offered for this pre-1914 stylized fact, but we
have previously found Figure 1 a useful way to think about it. Here, movements along
some downward-sloping home country emigration function (EM) are isolated from shifts
in that function (Hatton and Williamson 1994; 1998: Chapter 2; 2005: Chp. 4). In poor,

4

pre-industrial, agrarian economies, we observe low emigration rates (e0) and low real
wages or living standards (w0).1 Industrialization, accumulation, and productivity
advance then serve to shift the emigration function outward to EM' and to raise real
wages to w1. The impact of economic growth on the home wage may be obvious, but the
outward shift in the EM function may not. Indeed, the outward shift in EM dominates in
this example since emigration rates have risen to e1; in the absence of the shift in EM,
emigration rates would have fallen to e1'. In later stages of development, EM is taken to
be stable so that further improvements in real wages at home, to w2, cut back emigration
rates to e2. Should EM shift backwards, the downside of the emigration life cycle will be
even steeper. Thus, Figure 1 can easily reproduce the emigration life-cycle.
But what might account for the rightward shift in EM during the start of modern
economic growth and its stability, or even backward shift, thereafter? The first
explanation appeals to the costs of migration. Although there is certainly a strong
incentive to flee pre-industrial poverty and rural subsistence, the costs are likely to be
prohibitive for most poor laborers. After all, the potential migrant cannot get loans for the
move (a classic case of capital market failure), and his current income is too close to
subsistence to make it possible to accumulate the necessary savings to invest in some
future, long distance move. Thus, enormous wage gaps between an industrial, resourcerich, high-wage country and an agrarian, resource-poor, low-wage country can be quite
consistent with low emigration rates. In short, poor agrarian countries are locked in a
poverty trap so that those who have the most to gain from the move are least able to
exploit the opportunity. But as modern development takes hold in the home country, real

1

Ceteris paribus applies to Figure 1, so conditions abroad are taken as given, including real wages. Thus,
any rise in the home wage in the figure implies some catching up with high wage immigration countries.

5

wages rise and the supply constraint on emigration is gradually released: more and more
potential emigrants can now finance the move, and, in contrast with conventional theory,
the home wage and emigration are positively correlated. The supply constraint is also
released by greater remittances coming from an increasing stock of emigrants abroad. As
industrialization at home continues, the backlog of potential migrants is slowly exhausted
as more and more workers find it possible to finance the move. When the migration cost
constraint is no longer binding, further increases in the real wage cause the emigration
rate to decline from the peak, as conventional theory predicts.
Thus, emigration histories should pass through two regimes, the first emigrant
supply constrained, and the second emigrant demand constrained, as in Figure 2. The
emigrant-supply-constrained regime is consistent with rising emigration and rising home
wages, and it can also be made consistent with the downward-sloping EM function in
Figure 1 by appealing to rightward shifts in that function induced by absolute wage
increases (as opposed to relative wages and catching up). At some point, home wages get
high enough so that financial constraints are no longer binding: further increases in the
home wage then reduce the emigration rate as the economy moves up and back along a
more stable EM function, and emigration experience enters the demand-constrained
regime. While this tale of regime switch certainly sounds plausible, we should remember
that it takes no account of changing conditions in the receiving countries. If the
emigration rate is ever to decline from its peak after the regime switch, the sending region
has to begin catching up with the receiving region, as described in Figure 1. If it does not
undergo catching up, the downside of the life cycle may never be reached.

6

Of course, there are more forces driving the emigration life cycle than simply
costs of the move and wage catch up. Here are three. First, even after controlling for
poverty-induced cost constraints, illiteracy can be a barrier to emigration. Thus, as late
19th century eastern and southern European countries underwent a revolution in
elementary schooling (Kirk 1946; Easterlin 1981; Williamson 2007), young adults were
empowered to exit, an effect sufficiently strong that they were able to leap over the
literacy requirement passed by the United States Congress in 1917 to keep them out
(Hatton and Williamson 2005: Chps. 8 and 9; Williamson 2007). This schooling effect
should shift the EM curve in Figure 1 outward until all potential migrants are literate,2
after which EM remains stable. Second, the number at risk will matter. When countries
start modern development, they also start a demographic transition: child mortality rates
fall, and about two decades later the young adult cohort swells. Thus, for the same costs
and benefits to a move, more will do so as the share of the population mobile rises. This
too will shift the EM curve in Figure 1 outward, but as the demographic transition
continues, the young adult cohort share will eventually start to shrink, and the EM curve
will shift back inwards to the left. Hence, the emigration life cycle is strengthened by the
demographic transition. Third, a rising stock of previous emigrants living abroad
generates the well-known friends and relatives affect: by helping finance the move and
lowering the cost of job search, previous emigrants serve to augment the current flow of
new emigrants. This effect is big at the start of the emigrant life cycle, as the emigrant
stock abroad rises steeply from low levels. But as the rate of growth in the immigrant

Of course, what matters here is the schooling of the young prior to their reaching migration ages, not the
schooling (or its absence) of the older adults they leave behind.

7

stock in the host country slows down, so too does the friends and relatives effect,3 thus
causing the EM curve to stabilize. In short, outward shifts in the EM curve – more young
adults at risk, lower costs of the move, more resources to finance the move, and more
literate potential movers – contribute to an emigration boom, while a cessation in these
forces, and wage catching up, contribute to an emigration bust.

The Third World Emigration Life Cycle since the 1960s

Pre-1914 mass migration without state intervention is one thing, but what about
post-1970 mass migration under quotas and other restrictions? Here we focus on
migrants from the three major developing regions: Latin America, including the
Caribbean; the Middle East, North Africa and Asia; and Sub-Saharan Africa. We exclude
from consideration the countries of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe as these
are affected by the political regime change in the middle of the period.4 Table 1 shows for
the five-year periods between 1970-4 and 2000-45 the immigration rates to the US
(migrants relative to US population) and emigration rates (migrants relative to sourceregion population), with 1970-4 = 100. Three things stand out in the upper two panels.
First, immigration rates increase much more steeply than do emigration rates. The surge
of migrants looks a lot more modest when standardized by the more rapidly-growing
source populations.6 Second, emigration rates often tend to lead immigration rates: thus,

3

Aging of the immigrant stock abroad may have the same effect as family and kin ties weaken with
assimilation in the host country.
4
We also exclude the poor counrties of Oceania where the numbers are miniscule.
5
The migration rates are for fiscal years 1970/1-2004/5.
6
It would look even more modest if the emigrants were included in the denominator, although the
differences are slight.

8

Asian emigration rates peaked a decade before immigration rates. Third, Asian
emigration rates reached a peak in the 1980-84 while Latin American emigration rates
reached a peak just a half decade later, in 1985-94. By contrast, the emigration rate from
Sub-Saharan Africa continued to grow throughout the period.
The lower panel of Table 1 provides a more detailed breakdown for Latin
America and Asia. It shows that the trend in Latin American emigration is not just due to
Mexico (which accounted for about half of all US immigration from the Americas during
the 1991-2000 decade, including Canada: Hatton and Williamson 2005: p. 208). Neither
is it solely due to the legalization of undocumented migrants (principally from Mexico)
that affected the figures in 1989-91. Emigration rates from the Caribbean, Central
America and South America all have peak emigration rates in the decade 1985-94. The
pattern for Asia is similar but a bit more mixed: North African and Middle Eastern
(MENA) emigration rates underwent a pronounced decline after 1980-4; East Asian rates
underwent a more modest decline after 1990-94; and the South Asian decline after 199094 was actually reversed in 2000-04.
These trends raise four questions. First, are they driven by a few countries with
very large immigrant numbers that dominate the regional totals? Or, is there a distinct life
cycle pattern in the emigration rates even if we give equal weight to each country? We
investigate this possibility by regressing the log of emigration rates (to allow for
differences in scaling) on time and time squared for all the countries in each regional
sample over the seven five-year periods 1970-4 to 2000-4, using country fixed effects.
Table 2 shows that for the 26 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean there is a
significant inverted U with a maximum in the early 1990s. A similar (significant) life

9

cycle pattern is found for 35 countries in the North Africa, the Middle East and Asia; the
squared term is negative and the peak occurs in the early 1990s. By contrast, only the
linear term is significant for Sub-Saharan Africa, the sending region containing the
poorest countries. These results confirm a fall in emigration rates for two of the major
sending regions, while the third has yet to reach its peak.
Second, is the fall in Third World emigration rates just for those going to the
United States, or are the same effects observed for other immigrant host countries? Table
3 shows immigration and emigration rates to Canada and Germany from the three
sending regions.7 The Latin American and Asian immigration rates for Canada have been
falling since 1990-94, repeating the US pattern. This suggests that the slowdown and fall
in immigration rates from the early 1990s is not just the result of US-specific policy
changes. And, again repeating the US pattern, immigration rates from Africa and Asia
rose much more steeply over the long term than did the emigration rates. Also, the
emigration rates from Asia and Latin America into Canada have fallen more dramatically
since 1990-94 than have immigration rates, as has been true of the US. Finally, the rise in
the emigration rate to Canada from Africa, once again, was slower than for the
immigration rate.
The lower panels of Table 3 document the immigration and emigration rates to
Germany. These comparisons are complicated by German reunification in 1990 and the
migration rates here are based on the combined population throughout. The German
immigration rates display a strong upward trend to 1990-94, and a fall (or a pronounced

7

Other host countries do not offer the kind of evidence necessary for the empirical analysis which follows.

10

slowdown in the rise) thereafter. Once again, emigration rates show a more pronounced
life cycle than do immigration rates.8
Third, are the recent downward trends or pronounced slowdowns in emigration
rates simply due to tougher immigration policies in host countries rather than to declining
emigration pressure in source regions? Imagine for a moment that the immigration rate
reflects only policy and that policy has been aimed at stabilizing immigration relative to
the home population. This implies that emigration rates from regions with rapidly
growing populations should fall. Under such conditions, policy gets tougher, and all the
more so if there are pressures pushing up source country emigration rates.
Finally, if emigration policy got tougher over time, did emigration pressure from
sending countries create those policies? That is, can immigration policies in host
countries be viewed as an endogenous political response to rising emigration pressure
abroad? Perhaps, but it does not appear to have been the case that immigrants from Latin
America, Asia and Africa have crowded out potential immigrants from other regions, an
effect that would have eased any political pressure for tougher immigration restrictions.
That is, while emigration from eastern Europe, southern Europe and the former Soviet
Union fell as a proportion of US immigration from the 1960s to the 1980s, that share
stabilized between the 1980s and 1990s. In any case, the central point is this: when
analyzing trends in migration from any source region, overall host country policy
constraints must be taken in to account. The empirical work that follows does just that.

8

Note that both the immigration and the emigration rates from Turkey fall steeply from the end of the
guestworker era after 1974.

Possible Causes of the Third World Emigration Life Cycle

Here we focus on emigration rates to the United States from Latin America, Asia
and Africa. After all, the US is home to more than half of the stock of inter-continental
immigrants from these regions. US immigration offers the best opportunity to evaluate
the longer term trends since its immigrants come from a wider variety of countries over a
longer period than is true for most other host countries. Thus, we can include more source
countries in the empirical analysis without having to place too much weight on migration
streams that are small and volatile.
Our goal is to identify the source country economic and demographic
fundamentals that drive emigration to the US. As in all migration models, the major
determinant is income of the home country relative to US. However, the incentive to
migrate does not depend just on income gaps, but also on the human capital of the
potential migrant needed to exploit the gap. Therefore, we also include relative education,
using average years of schooling in the home country relative to the US (Barro and Lee
2001). The positive effect of home country education that is often found in migration
equations reflects the fact that higher home education for a given income level implies a
lower rate of return to education at home. Alternatively, schooling in the home country
gives the potential emigrant the credentials to take advantage of the higher relative
income in the host country.9
9

In any case, the result should not necessarily be interpreted as suggesting that the more educated have

higher mobility.

12

Two demographic fundamentals feature in most migration models. The first is the
relative size of the migration intensive cohort, reflecting the fact that the net present value
of a given income gap is higher for young adults. To measure this first demographic
fundamental, we use the relative size of the cohort aged 0-14 fifteen years before the date
of observation.10 The second key demographic fundamental is the stock of immigrants
from the source country resident in the US. This measures the friends and relatives effect
that is thought to diminish the cost and uncertainty of migration. Most studies find this
effect to be powerful. Perhaps even more to the point, the friends and relatives effect
should be all the more powerful in the presence of immigration policies that favor family
reunification, as they do in the US.11 We measure the effect by dividing the US migrant
stock from each source country by the source country population at the beginning of each
five year period.
It is widely recognized that poverty acts as a constraint on migration owing to
capital market imperfections. This constraint is especially important for long-distance
moves as it is hard to raise a loan for an investment in a move which takes the borrower
out of the lender’s jurisdiction. Here we proxy the share of the population in poverty by a
non-linear transformation of per capita income so that the poverty-reducing effects of an
increase in income are more powerful at lower income levels. While poverty implies
lower mobility, the poverty constraint is likely to be loosened by having friends and

10

The size of the 0-14 age group lagged fifteen years is used rather than the current size of the 15-29 age
group since the latter is likely to be diminished by (the predicted) high exit rates.
11
The friends and relatives effect should be much more powerful for the US where family reunification
policy has always been more generous. Family reunification could also weaken the role of young adult
cohort size in pushing emigrants out of sending countries. This prediction could be explored by a
comparison of emigration rates to the US with that of other host countries, an issue not explored here or, as
far as we know, elsewhere in the literature.

13

relatives at the destination: hence, the larger the migrant stock in the host country, the
less the poverty constraint facing potential emigrants.
Finally, and as noted earlier, immigration policies must be considered in the
analysis. If immigration policies have become tougher since the early 1990s, then this
fact could account for the slow down or decline in emigration rates in recent years. One
way of taking host country policy into account is to include period fixed effects which
should capture any common trends in migration across different source countries, like
host country policy. An alternative approach is to include a measure of the overall
immigration quota in the analysis: here, policy ‘toughness’ is measured as the total US
immigration quota relative to the population of all three sending regions (see Appendix).
We much prefer the quota-based measure, but we will try both in the analysis.

Explaining Third World Emigration to the United States 1970-2005

Table 4 presents the results of regressions for emigration rates to the US from 62
countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa (see Appendix). We use a balanced panel, 24
of the countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, 25 in Asia, the Middle East and
North Africa, and 13 in sub-Saharan Africa. The African sample is limited by the data
both for migration and for the explanatory variables. The dependent variable is the log of
five-year total emigration rates for fiscal years (e.g. 1970-4 includes the fiscal years
1970/1 to 1974/5), while all explanatory variables are for the beginning of the five year
period (e.g. 1970, 1975). Fixed country effects ensure that we focus on the trends over
time, absorbing in the fixed effects variables such as distance between the source country

14

and the US, whether the source country is English speaking, and cultural affinities
between the two.
The column (1) regression includes five-year period dummies which capture
changing immigration policies and any other trends, such as falling migration costs and
information diffusion that would be common to all source countries. The cohort effect is
the right sign but not significant in this regression. However, the income ratio and the
education ratio are strongly significant with the expected signs. Furthermore, the two
estimated coefficients are of a similar magnitude, supporting the view that relative
income and relative education should have equal and opposite effects. The log ratio of the
emigrant stock to source country population is strongly positive, reflecting the power of
the friends and relatives effect, enhanced by the immigration policy filter. While the
effect of poverty is negative as predicted, it is attenuated by an increase in the emigrant
stock, also as predicted.
The column (2) regression replaces the period dummies with our preferred
immigration policy constraint variable. Controlling for the policy environment properly
serves to increase the size and significance of the cohort size coefficient and to reduce the
size of the still-significant relative income and relative education coefficients. The effect
of a one percentage point increase in the size of the migration-sensitive cohort in the
source country increases emigration to the US by about 2.4 percent. This effect is large—
at the sample averages it implies an increase in five-year emigration rates of about 3 per
thousand of the source population between the early 1970s and the early 1990s. The
effect of the migrant stock is also large: an increase of one percent in the US source
country migrant stock increases the emigration rate by about 0.32 percent. At the sample

15

means (including the interaction with poverty), this implies a chain migration effect
where for every 1000 of the stock of previous migrants a further 90 would arrive in the
following five-year period, or 18 each year. That figure was much the same in the 19th
century (20 each year: Hatton and Williamson 2005, p. 65), and, as we shall see, this has
important implications for the dynamics of migration since it means that migration
streams persist long after the original shocks that created them.
The effect of source country poverty is of special interest. Excluding the
interaction with the migrant stock, a doubling in per capita income from US$1,000 to
$2,000 (about equivalent to the East and Southeast Asian per capita income level in 1960
and its growth rate between 1960 and 1985, 3.4 percent: Maddison 2008) increases the
emigration rate by 12 percent. In contrast, an increase for today’s middle income country
from $10,000 to $11,000 has a negligible effect on the emigration rate (0.03 percent). To
see more clearly how the poverty-constraint-eradication effect contributes to the
emigration life cycle, note that a 50 percent increase in per capita income at $1000 raises
the emigration rate by 9 percent while the same percentage increase at $10,000 raises the
emigration rate by just 0.1 percent. That is, the poverty effect is non-linear, powerful at
low-income levels and weak at middle-income levels. Thus, the poverty effect by itself
can produce the emigration life cycle.
But there are two forces that tend to offset the poverty constraint. The first offset
operates through the relative income gap. With no change income at the destination and
no change in relative education, a 50 percent increase in per capita income from $1,000
reduces emigration by 12 percent—exactly offsetting the poverty effect. However, if per
capita income growth at home is positive but does not exceed that of the US, then

16

emigration pressure rises. The second effect can occur through the interaction with the
migrant stock. For example, when a country with a migrant stock abroad equivalent to 10
per thousand of the home population enjoys an increase in per capita income from $1000
to $2000, the emigration rate increases by just 1.3 percent, as compared with a 12 percent
increase for a country with zero migrant stock (i.e. no emigration history). Thus for poor
countries, a large migrant stock in the host country can largely eliminate the poverty
constraint, as it did for the Irish in the 19th century.
The regressions in columns (3) and (4) explore the result when the interaction
between the poverty proxy and the migrant stock is omitted. It matters. In column (3), the
poverty effect is now negligible, which highlights the importance of the friends and
relatives effect in releasing the poverty constraint. Column (4) shows that in the absence
of the migrant stock the effect of the coefficients on relative income and relative
education increase dramatically. This is because the migrant stock reflects past
immigration, which in turn depends on past gaps in relative income and relative
education that persist to the present. In effect, without the migrant stock, economic
fundamentals matter much more since migrants tend to be driven by job opportunities
rather than family ties.

Decomposing the Sources of Trends in Third World Emigration Rates

This section explores emigration rate trends by source region to see how the
fundamentals that determine emigration (Table 4) influenced long term trends. Table 5
compares actual log emigration rates with predicted rates in our balanced panel for each

17

of the seven five-year periods, both expressed as deviations from the overall 1970-2004
mean for the source region. The patterns observed for these mean deviations do not
exactly replicate Tables 1 and 2 since they are estimated with a smaller sample of source
countries. Nevertheless, the patterns are certainly consistent.
The actual or observed mean deviation for Latin America and the Caribbean rises
from 36 log points below the average in 1970-4 to 31 log points above the average in
1985-9 before falling close to the mean in 2000-4. The predicted values rise from 44 log
points below the average in 1970-4 to a plateau of 22 log points above the average from
1985-9 onwards. For the Asia, Middle East and North Africa region, there is a steep
increase in observed mean deviations from -39 log points in 1970-4 to a peak of 26 log
points in 1990-4 followed by a decline to 16 log points in 2000-4. The predicted values
yield a similar profile, although the predicted peak occurs in 1985-9 rather than 1990-4.
As was found in Table 2, the trajectory for sub-Saharan Africa is a fairly linear upward
trend. This is evident in both the actual and predicted series although it is stronger in the
former.
Two questions naturally follow. The first, which we pursue here, is this: How do
the underlying explanatory variables account for these emigration trends in the source
regions? We save the second for the next section: What happens to the Third World
emigration rate when the explanatory variables are projected into the future? In order to
examine the contributions of the different variables we multiply the change in the
explanatory variable by its coefficient in column 2 of Table 4. Table 6 reports the
decomposition for changes in the emigration rates in log points. For Latin America and
the Caribbean and for Asia, the Middle East and North Africa we distinguish between the

18

upswing from 1970-4 to 1990-4 and the subsequent decade whereas for sub-Saharan
Africa we take the three decades as a whole.
In all three sending regions, the migrant stock effect made the most important
contribution to the emigration rate boom, reflecting the importance of family
reunification in US immigration policy. Yet, there is another way of interpreting the
migration stock effect: it has embedded in it the impact of all these fundamentals which,
in the past, brought the primary family mover to the United States. Thus, consider the
share each fundamental contributed to the residual difference between all effects up to
peak and that of the migrant stock (e.g. 0.60-0.38 = 0.22 for Latin America and the
Caribbean). Using this accounting, here are the contributions of the key fundamentals in
percent for Latin America and Africa: Latin America, income gap 36, birth cohort 32,
education gap 22, and poverty 0; Africa, income gap 70, education gap 28, birth cohort
20, and poverty -20. Asia is especially interesting. Were it not for the migrant stock
effect, Asian emigration rates would have fallen between 1970-4 and 1990-4 (0.50-0.87 =
-0.37), and almost all of that was being driven by education gap catch up (education gap
89 percent) and income catch up (income gap 16 percent).

What Will Third World Emigration Rates Look Like in the Future?

What should we assume about host country policy when we project the future?
Clearly immigration policy has important effects on the numbers who are able to
emigrate to the United States. Recall that our measure of the overall immigration
constraint is the total US quota divided by the total population of the three sending

19

regions for each five year period. While the overall quota trended upward, so did the
population of the three sending regions. As it turns out, there has been no change in the
US policy constraint since 1970, at least as we have defined it.12 Thus, the projections
will assume that there will be neither tightening nor loosening in the immigration
constraint in the near future.
To examine the underlying trends in the explanatory variables by sending region,
in our balanced panel they are regressed on a quadratic in time, with country fixed
effects. We have observations for each of the explanatory variables on most of the
countries back to 1960. The demographic projection (which involves a lagged variable)
relies on the UN’s estimates up to 2020. The squared term is dropped where it is
insignificant. The results are provided in Table 7.
The size of the relevant birth cohort follows a strong quadratic inverse U shape
trend for all three sending regions. The birth cohort variable trend peaks is in the late
1980s for Latin America and Asia, while that for sub-Saharan reaches a peak around
2000. In contrast, the relative income and relative education trends are uniformly linear.
Latin America exhibits some falling behind in income per capita relative to the US (the
positive coefficient 0.0603 implying a rise in the income gap), but some catching up in
relative education (the negative coefficient -0.048 implying a fall in the education gap) .
Sub-Saharan Africa fell further behind in relative income even more than Latin America
but exhibited even greater catching up in relative education. The trend in poverty has
been clearly downwards in Latin America, and even more so in Asia, although in both
12

Our measure of policy exhibits an inverse U shaped trend that is almost entirely the result of the
legalization program under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 that resulted in a large
increase in recorded migration in 1989-91, most of which came from Mexico. If we exclude this
component of the policy index then there is no evidence of a trend. When this modified version of log
policy is regressed on a trend the coefficient is -0.011, with a ‘t’ value of 0.51.

20

cases it flattens out as would be expected given the functional form of the poverty
variable. Sub-Saharan Africa’s poor economic performance is reflected by a linear
upward trend.13
The projected emigration rates are derived using the quadratic or linear trend in
the fundamentals as reported in Table 7. The trends in these variables will have a
cumulative effect on emigration rates since they affect the host country migrant stock in
successive periods, thus influencing future emigration rates. For each of the fundamentals
in Table 7, we calculate the effect of the change on emigration rates in each period but we
also take account of the effect on the migrant stock in subsequent periods. Thus, the
simulation updates the migrant stock in each period and adds the indirect effects on
emigration through the migrant stock (including its interaction with poverty) to the direct
effect in the subsequent period. Table 8 reports the overall difference in log points
between the simulated emigration rate in 2020-4 and in the base period 2000-4. These are
averages for the individual countries in each regional group.
For Latin America and Asia, demographic pressures are predicted to reduce
emigration rates by 21-22 log points on average. These demographic forces will dominate
trends in emigration rates in the future since no other fundamental will do anywhere near
the work that this one will in these two regions. However, the combined effects of
relative income and relative education partially offset the effect of demographic trends:
the two combined increase emigration rates by 12 log points in Latin America and 8 log
points in Asia. Sub-Saharan Africa offers a sharp contrast: the demographic effects are
negative but small, while the relative income and relative education effects are both

13

Note, however, that the level of significance (t = 1.78) is lower for sub-Saharan Africa, reflecting the
large variance in economic performance across the region.

21

positive, adding up to a powerful 30 log points. The effects of rising poverty (including
the interaction with the migrant stock) are neutral for Latin America -- where the poverty
constraint is less binding, and positive for Asia – where poverty more binding but is
being quickly eroded. Poverty is projected to increase in sub-Saharan Africa and its
impact tends to reduce emigration rates powerfully (larger than the birth cohort or income
gap effect): the effects are negative as the direct effect of deepening poverty outweighs
the interaction with the migrant stock.
The penultimate row in Table 8 shows the independent effect of the migrant
stock. This arises because migrant stocks are projected to increase even in the absence of
any further ‘push’ from the other emigration fundamentals. The higher is current
emigrant flow relative to the previous migration stock, the greater is the rate of increase
of the stock, which in turn boosts emigration rates in the next period. These migrant stock
dynamics produce effects that persist into the future at different rates for different source
regions. For the Latin American countries, where the current migrant stock is relatively
high relative to the flow, the stock dynamics have no effect (0 log points). For the Asia
and MENA countries, where the current migrant stock is lower, dynamics increase the
emigration rate by 8 log points between 2000-4 and 2020-4. The most striking result,
however, is for sub-Saharan Africa, where the migrant stock is low relative to the current
flow: in this case, stock dynamics are projected to increase the emigration rate by an
enormous 21 log points.
Adding these effects together, the overall projection implies a decline in the
emigration rate from Latin America and the Caribbean, and a stable emigration rate from
Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa, on the other hand, is

22

projected to undergo a steep increase of 19 log points in its emigration rate, driven by
rising income gaps, falling education gaps and migrant stock dynamics. When the three
regions are weighted by shares in total US immigration, the projected result is a modest
fall of 1.8 log points in the overall emigration rate. Alternatively, when they are weighted
by sending region populations, the result is a modest increase of 2.7 log points. When we
look beyond 2024, the migrant stock dynamics weaken and the continued fall in the other
fundamentals will almost certainly cause Third World emigration rates to fall.
In contrast with media hysteria and academic assumption, these results strongly
support the view that there will be no mounting emigration pressure from the Third
World over the next two decades, and a likely fall thereafter. Of course, if Africa starts to
register double digit GDP per capita growth rates, the fall in emigration rates may be
postponed as unlocking the poverty trap will dominate before the effect of reduction in
the income gap takes over.

Why Did Third World Emigration Wait Until After the 1960s?

Why didn’t the Third World post-war emigration boom start in the late 1940s, the
1950s or the 1960s? After all, the income gap between industrial and Third World
countries was huge. Why did the boom wait until the 1970s? Now that we have analyzed
the Third World emigration life cycle over the half century 1970-2024, the answers
should be clearer. Four fundamental forces emerged simultaneously, and all four
underwent dramatic change between the 1950s and 1970s:

23

Leveling the policy playing field: From the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 until the
Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 (which became effective in mid-1968), the US
applied strict country of origin quotas that were related to the stock of foreign-born in the
US population before the First World War. The 1965 Act replaced this regime with a
non-discriminatory policy under which migrants from all countries could compete
equally for immigration into the US,14 first under separate quotas for the Eastern and
Western Hemispheres and then under a combined worldwide quota after 1979.15 The new
policy regime also greatly favored immigrants arriving by family reunification, most of
whom did not even fall under the quota.
The composition of US immigrants by source changed dramatically between the
1950s and the 1970s. The European, Canadian and Oceanic share fell by about 45
percentage points, and the Third World share rose by 55 percentage points, the rise for
Asia by itself 29 percentage points (Hatton and Williamson 2005: Table 10.2). Policy
reform certainly opened up opportunities for migrants from poor countries, but dramatic
changes on the supply side transformed the benign policy regime into a surge of
migration.
Third World schooling revolutions started reducing the education gap: A revolution
in primary schooling and literacy took place in the Third World prior to the emigration
boom (Easterlin 1981; Schultz 1987), and it started to erase the education gap between
the US and sending countries. Between 1960 and 1981 the ratio of expected years of
schooling in industrial countries relative to low-income countries fell from 1.92 to 1.60,

14

Non-discriminatory immigration policies were enacted a little later by Canada, Australia and New
Zealand.
15
Before 1979 the overall quota for the Eastern Hemisphere was 170,000 per annum; for the Western
Hemisphere it was 120,000 until 1976 and then 88,800 for 1977-78.

24

and the same ratio relative to middle income oil importers fell from 1.82 to 1.44
(Williamson 1993: Table 4.8). Between 1960 and 1987, the education stock (school years
per person ages 15-64: Nehru et al. 1995: Table 1) rose by only 0.3 percent per annum in
the industrial countries, but by 4 percent in the developing world. Based on our model
and the countries in our sample, the direct effects of those trends would have been to
increase emigration rates from Latin America and the Caribbean by 5 log points between
1950-4 and 1970-4, by 10 log points from Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, and by
8 log points for Sub-Saharan Africa.
Growth miracles started unlocking the poverty trap: Not many Third World regions
started catching up with the industrial world like the East Asian gang of four did, but per
capita incomes did rise enough to start unlocking Third World poverty traps. Between
1950 and 1970, per capita income rose by 52 percent in Africa, by 41 percent in East
Asia, by 59 percent in Latin America, and – pulled by oil – by 125 percent in the Middle
East (Maddison 2008). The direct effects of unlocking the poverty trap would have added
10 log points to the emigration rate from Asia between 1950-4 and 1970-4.
Demographic transitions began to yield fat young adult cohorts: The timing of the
demographic transition in the Third World mattered. The share of Asia’s population aged
0-14 started rising rapidly in the 1950s, with the result that the migration-sensitive age
group rose sharply in the 1970s and 1980s. The share of the working age population in
Asia rose dramatically after it bottomed out in the late 1960s, and other sending regions
followed. For example, the East Asian adult percent share rose from about 57 in 1965 to
67 in 1995 (ADB 1997: Figure 3.4). Based on our model, the direct effects of the
demographic transition would have added a huge 20 log points to emigration rates from

25

Latin America and the Caribbean and from Asia, the Middle East and North Africa from
1950-4 to 1970-4. Demographic pressures increased a little later in sub-Saharan Africa
but they still would have added about 16 log points to the migration rate between 1950-4
and 1970-4.
What would have happened if the US Congress had passed those Amendments to
the US Immigration Act in 1950 rather than 1965? Emigration pressures stemming from
the key fundamentals were much lower in 1950 but by the 1960s they were building up.
Most importantly, the stock of migrants from the Third World was relatively low in 1950
partly because emigration pressures were modest and partly because of discriminatory
policies, like the Asiatic Barred Zone which prohibited Asian immigration from 1917 to
1952. This suggests that emigration from Asia would have surged in the 1960s rather
than in the 1970s when its share in total US immigration increased from 12.9 percent in
1961-9 to 35.3 percent in 1971-9 (Hatton and Williamson 2005, p. 208). In Latin
America, emigration pressures were building up more slowly, policy was much less
restrictive, and there was already a substantial migrant stock. As a result, the emigration
rate rose only modestly between the 1960s and the 1970s. Finally, emigration from
Africa was very small in the 1950s as Africans were constrained both by colonialism and
poverty. Although migration from Africa rose continuously, the base was very small and
the increase was driven almost entirely by the migrant stock.

Host Country Implications

This paper has argued that to understand the forces that drive international
migration we must take a source country perspective. Only then can we assess the

26

fundamental forces that have underpinned the ebb and flow of migration over the last half
century that will drive migration in the future. Much of literature, however, takes a host
country perspective and its agenda is often determined by host country concerns about
rising migration pressure leading to soaring immigration rates. What do we find when we
look instead at the supply side, using the United States as our window on the process?
Trends in migration rates are very different when viewed from a source country
perspective. Since the Second World War, population growth rates have been higher and
fell later in poor sending countries compared with rich host countries where they have
been lower and fell sooner. This has served to influence the timing and magnitude of the
migration rates: emigration rates have tended to lead immigration rates, but they have
been less dramatic.
These trends in late 20th century Third World emigration rates trace out country
and region life cycles, and the underlying fundamentals can be identified. First, the US
migrant stock effect made the most important contribution to the boom up to the 1990s,
reflecting both the importance of family reunification in US immigration policy and that
the impact of previous changes in the economic and demographic fundamentals got
embedded in the current migrant stock. Indeed, were it not for the migrant stock effect,
Asian emigration rates would have fallen after 1970-74, rather than rising to 1980-4. The
change in the poverty trap mattered only for Africa, where a rise in poverty rates reduced
emigration rates over time. Education catch up played an important role everywhere in
the Third World, augmenting emigration rates. The birth cohort effect also played an
important role in Latin America and Africa, but not in Asia (where much of the
demographic transition had already run its course by the 1970s). While there was

27

certainly per capita income growth in Asia and Latin America, it was not fast enough to
reduce the income gap with the US, and thus it contributed a little to the emigration
boom. For Africa, however, it contributed a lot, as poor growth performance caused
Africa to lose ground and the income gap to rise.
Having estimated the causes of the Third World emigration rates over the past
half century, we turned to projections of the future. These projections speak to a changing
composition of US immigration by source and its total size. In 2000-4, the US
immigration shares (of the three region total) were 41 percent from Latin America and
the Caribbean, 53 percent from Asia, North Africa and the Middle East, and 6 percent
from Sub-Saharan Africa. By 2020-4, the share from Latin America and the Caribbean is
projected to fall to 38 percent while the share from Asia, the Middle East and North
Africa will decrease modestly to 52 percent. The most striking change is the rise in the
share from sub-Saharan Africa from 6 to 10 percent, a significant increase in the share of
Africans. In short, US immigrants will be more African and less Hispanic fifteen or
twenty years for now.
A final observation is this. History demonstrates that migration stock dynamics
are important. During the transatlantic migrations of the late 19th century, for each
thousand of the migrant stock 20 more migrants were pulled across the Atlantic each year
(Hatton and Williamson 2005, p. 65). That 19th century figure is close to the late 20th
century 18 per thousand estimate obtained here. The ‘friends and relatives effect’ was
particularly strong in the upswing of every sending region emigration cycle, first for
Latin American emigrants, a little later for Asian emigrants, and most recently (and in the
future) for the Africans. While the migrant stock effects tend to fade over time, they

28

nevertheless cause migration rates to persist long after the other fundamentals have
turned down. This is an important reason why the impending decline in Third World
emigration rates has been obscured from view.

Data Sources
Immigration to USA: Five-year total immigration to the United States by country of birth is taken
from the Department of Homeland Security, Yearbook of Immigration Statistics (before 2002
entitled the Statistical Yearbook of the Immigration and Naturalization Service). Five year totals
calculated from annual data, with an adjustment to the years 1976 and earlier for the change in the
fiscal year. The country of origin classification used here is country of birth rather than country of
last residence. This ensures consistency with the immigrant flow and the immigrant stock as
measured in the census.
Immigrant stock in the US: Foreign born stock data for the census years 1970, 1980 and 1990 are
taken from C. J. Gibson and E. Lennon (1999), “Historical Census Statistics on the Foreign-born
Population of the United States, 1850-1990,” US Census Bureau Population Division, Technical
Working Paper No. 29. Data for 2000 were obtained from the 2000 US Census. The intervening
years 1975, 1985 and 1995 using the stock accumulation equation St+1 = (1-d)St + Mt where M is
the migrant inflow, S is the migrant stock and d is the ‘depreciation ‘ rate calculated for each
intercensal period.
Source country population: Total population and share aged 0-14 taken from United Nations
(2007), “World Population Prospects: the 2006 Revision” (CD ROM).
Years of education: Average years of education for the population age 15 and over, at five-year
intervals from the database of Barro and Lee, available at: http://www2.cid.harvard.edu.

Income per capita: Income per capita at constant 2000 prices (chain series) for years ending in 0
and 5 from A. Heston, R. Summers and B. Aten, Penn World Table 6.2, University of
Pennsylvania, Center for International Comparisons of Production Income and Prices, available
at: http://pwt.econ.upenn.edu/php_site/pwt_index.php.
US immigration policy: The immigration policy constraint is modeled as the number of
immigrants coming under the overall quota. These include non-immediate relatives, employment
visas, diversity immigrants, refugees and asylees, and those admitted under the Immigration
Reform and Control Act (1986). We take the effect of IRCA to be an increase in immigration of
2.7 million spread over the three years 1989-1991. This measure of the overall quota is applied to
all countries, rather than being tailored to each country. It amounts to two thirds of total
immigration between 1970 and 2005, with the other third accounted for by those family-reunified
migrants that do not fall under the US quota. The calculation of these categories is discussed in
full in Clark et al. (2007).The total of these categories for each five-year period is expressed per
thousand of the population in the three world regions at the beginning of the period.

Notes: fixed effects estimation on a balanced panel of five year total immigration for fiscal years—e.g.
1970-4 is fiscal years 1970/1 to 1974/5. All other variables are for the beginning of each five year period,
e,g, 1970 or 1985.
