Optimal Reserves in Financially Closed Economies

NBER Working Paper No. 22139
March 2016
JEL No. F32,F41
ABSTRACT
Financially closed economies insure themselves against current-account shocks using
international reserves. We characterize the optimal management of reserves using an openeconomy model of precautionary savings and emphasize several results. First, the welfare-based
opportunity cost of reserves differs from the measures often used by practitioners. Second, under
plausible calibrations the model is consistent with the rule of thumb that reserves should be close
to three months of imports. Third, simple linear rules can capture most of the welfare gains from
optimal reserve management. Fourth, policymakers should place more emphasis on how to use
reserves in response to shocks than on the reserve target itself.

Introduction

One question of considerable practical relevance for international economists
is the appropriate level of international reserves (IMF, 2011, 2013, 2015). In
this paper we study this question in the context of a model where reserves
play a very simple and basic role of precautionary savings against current
account shocks. To simplify the analysis we study the case of a small open
economy that insures against current account shocks with international reserves only. This case is applicable, at least as an approximation, to countries
in which the private sector cannot insure itself directly because it has little
access to international financial markets. This situation was more prevalent
under the Bretton Woods system than today, but it remains relevant for developing countries with the lowest levels of international financial integration.
We study the question of the optimal management of reserves using an intertemporal optimizing model of an open economy populated by an infinitelylived representative consumer. The consumer consumes nontradable goods
and imported goods. The economy is hit by shocks to the value of exports in
terms of imports (which might come from shocks to the quantity of exports
or to the terms of trade). The consumer holds claims against the domestic government, but does not have access to international financial markets.
The government issues domestic bonds and holds international reserves, i.e.,
bonds denominated in foreign currency. Reserves are foreign assets that are
held by the government on behalf of the domestic consumer.
We assume that the government is benevolent and manages reserves to
maximize domestic welfare. Reserves allow the country to smooth imports
in response to shocks to the value of its exports in terms of imports. The
optimal amount of reserves is the consumer’s optimal level of precautionary
savings in response to export income shocks. This is the type of thinking
that underpinned old rules of thumb such as “reserves should cover three
months of imports”.
We show that in the model the level of reserves tends to converge toward
a target and characterize how this target depends on the parameter values.
The influence of several parameters is summarized in a key variable, which
we call the “carry cost” of reserves. The carry cost is the difference between
the hypothetical real interest rate that would prevail under financial autarky
in the deterministic steady-growth path and the real return on reserves in
terms of imports. Measuring the carry cost as a spread between two interest
rates is reminiscent of the way that the cost of holding reserves is measured
2

in the existing literature on international reserves, but there are important
differences. In particular, the carry cost is not the same as two measures
that are often used by practitioners, the quasi-fiscal cost of holding reserves
for the central bank, and the spread between the cost of external borrowing
and the return on reserves. The carry cost is a theoretical construct that
involves a counterfactual interest rate that is not observed in the data.
We then calibrate our model using data on a sample of 21 developing
countries from 1960 to 2014. We select countries that were not very internationally financially integrated and so for which the current account was
arguably the main source of shocks. Our benchmark calibration implies a
carry cost equal to 6.9 percent, and a target level of reserves equal to 3.3
months of imports, remarkably close to the conventional three-months-ofimports rule of thumb. Furthermore, the model predicts a stochastic distribution of reserves whose average is very close to the average level of reserves
in our sample, about 4.5 months of imports.
The model predictions are however sensitive to the carry cost. In particular, the optimal level of reserves goes to infinity as the carry cost goes to
zero. This result is not surprising from the point of view of the literature
on precautionary savings, but it implies that it may be difficult in general
to determine whether an observed level of reserves is “excessive” based on
a precautionary savings model. However we find that if the consumer’s discount factor is lower than 1 it is difficult to rationalize a carry cost under 5
percent for the countries in our sample.
The policy function for reserves prescribed by the model is non-linear
and therefore cannot easily guide the actions of policy makers. We thus
investigate the extent to which the gains from optimal reserves management
can be reaped using simple linear rules. We find that the optimal policy
function is well approximated by a linear rule that makes reserves respond
to export income shocks in the short run and converge towards a target
in the long run. This rule can indeed yield more than 90 percent of the
welfare gains from optimal reserves management. We observe that under this
rule reserves respond significantly less to export income shocks than under
certainty equivalence. Furthermore, the optimal weight put on convergence
is not negligible since it implies that a deviation from the target has a half-life
of about three years.
We also assess the robustness of our linear rule to errors in the reserve
target or in the parameters controlling how reserves respond to shocks. While
practitioners have been mostly concerned about identifying an optimal target
3

for reserves, we show that this target has actually limited consequences for
welfare. Much more important is to adopt policy rules that optimally smooth
consumption in response to shocks. In particular, the optimal rule implies
significant and prolonged departures of reserves from the target in response
to shocks.
Literature. The paper is related to the literature on the optimal level of
reserves for an open economy. The cost-benefit approach to the optimal level
of reserves has inspired a long line of literature going back at least to Heller
(1966). In Heller’s analysis the optimal level of reserves was determined in
the context of a trade-off between their opportunity cost and the risk of an
external disequilibrium leading to a costly contraction in domestic absorption.1 More recently calibrated models include Jeanne (2007) or Jeanne and
Rancière (2011).2 Here we compare the implications of a precautionary savings model to the heuristic measures of the benefits and costs of reserves that
have been used in the empirical or policy literature (IMF, 2011, 2013, 2015).
The paper is also related to the question of how to make foreign assets
stationary in stochastic models of the current account. Linearizing a stochastic model of a small open economy leads to nonstationarity of foreign assets,
in contradiction with the maintained assumption that the economy should
stay close to a steady state. Many authors solve this problem by using the
assumptions reviewed by Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2003) to make foreign
assets stationary. As noted by Coeurdacier, Rey and Winant (2011) another
way of making foreign assets stationary is to solve for the equilibrium with
precautionary savings, as we do here. We show that the best linear rules
are rather different from the equilibrium policies derived from linearizing
models a la Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2003): significantly more weight is
put on convergence towards the target and significantly less weight is put on
smoothing.
This paper contributes to the literature on precautionary saving in the
open economy.3 One branch of this literature tries to explain global imbal1

The dynamic aspect of the authorities’ optimization problem was treated more rigorously in the buffer stock models of international reserves of Hamada and Ueda (1977)
and Frenkel and Jovanovic (1981).

However these contributions are not based on fully dynamics precautionary savings
models. In Jeanne and Rancière (2011) reserves contracts involve transfers that are contingent on the occurrence of shocks.

ances and upstream capital flows from developing to advanced economies.
Some papers look at precautionary savings in response to idiosyncratic income shocks (Carroll and Jeanne, 2009; Angeletos and Panousi, 2011; Sandri,
2014). Other papers, like this one, consider aggregate income shocks (Ghosh
and Ostry, 1997; Durdu, Mendoza and Terrones, 2009; Fogli and Perri, 2015;
Kent, 2015).

A model of optimal reserves management

We present the assumptions of the model (section 2.1) and then derive analytical results about the optimal level of reserves (section 2.2).

2.1

Model structure

The economy is populated by a unitary mass of identical atomistic consumers
and a government. The representative consumer maximizes,

where Mt is the consumption of imported good and Nt is the consumption
of nontraded good.
We write the budget constraints in terms of a foreign currency, which for
the sake of concreteness we call the dollar. The representative consumer’s
budget constraint is,
g
(1 + igt−1 )Bt−1
Btg
+ PM t Mt = PXt Xt +
+ Tt ,

where Xt and Mt are respectively the quantities of exports and imports, and
PXt and PM t are their dollar prices, Btg is government debt expressed in terms

of domestic currency and Et is the domestic currency per dollar exchange rate,
igt−1 is the domestic currency interest rate and Tt is a lump-sum transfer from
the government. The representative consumer does not have access to foreign
assets and can invest only in the liabilities of the domestic government.
The government budget constraint is,
g
(1 + igt−1 )Bt−1
Btg
+ Bt + Tt =
+ (1 + it−1 )Bt−1 ,
Et
Et

where Bt is the amount of dollar reserves, and it−1 is the dollar nominal
interest rate.
The government includes the central bank. The government can engage in
“open market” operations in which it changes its holdings of reserves and the
outstanding stock of domestic bonds by the same amounts. The words “open
market” are in quotes because the market is not really open: the domestic
bonds must be purchased by residents who do not have access to foreign
assets. A sterilized foreign exchange intervention in which the central bank
sells government debt (or sterilization bonds) to buy reserves corresponds, in
our model, to a simultaneous increase in Bt and Btg .
The two budget constraints can be consolidated into the current account
balance identity,
Bt − Bt−1 = PXt Xt − PM t Mt + it−1 Bt−1 .
There are exogenous processes for the value of exports PXt Xt , the price
of imports PM t , the output of nontradable good Nt , and the dollar nominal
interest rate it−1 . The imports Mt and reserves Bt are endogenous.
We assume that there is a trend growth factor G in income. We denote
in lower case the detrended variables expressed in terms of imports (except
for the consumption of nontradable good and total consumption, which are
simply detrended):

t − 1 and period t,
1 + it−1
1 + rt =
1 + πt
with the rate of inflation in imported goods denoted by π t = PM t /PM t−1 − 1.
We assume that the level of reserves must be positive,
bt ≥ 0.
If the constraint bt ≥ 0 is not binding the first-order condition for consumption is,

The equilibrium is driven by exogenous stochastic processes for xt , nt , and
rt , which are assumed to be stationary and Markov. The state at time t, thus,
is summarized by the current values of these variables and the level of reserves
accumulated in the previous period, st = (xt , nt , rt , bt−1 ). The equilibrium is
characterized by endogenous policy functions for total consumption, imports
and reserves, c(st ), m(st ) and b(st ). The policy functions satisfy (3) and

Carry cost and the target level of reserves

As shown by Carroll (2009) in the context of a similar model, if the following
condition holds
Gγ
> 1 + r,
(4)
β

7

the level of reserves bt tends to fluctuate around a “target” level, b∗ . This
is the long-run level that reserves converge to in the absence of shocks, i.e.
assuming that xt , nt , and rt remain equal to their average levels x, n, and r in
the stochastic model. In other words, shock realizations generate a stochastic
dispersion of reserves, but the model policy function attempts to bring the
level of reserves back to the target b∗ .
To understand condition (4), it is useful to define the “carry cost” of
reserves as,
Gγ
(5)
− (1 + r) .
δ=
β
The first term Gγ /β is equal to the interest rate that would prevail under
financial autarky in the deterministic steady-growth path. This is also the interest rate at which the representative consumer would be indifferent between
borrowing or saving in a deterministic version of the model. The second term
is the rate of return that the consumer earns on reserves.
Condition (4) requires the carry cost to be positive. Assume that the
carry cost is actually zero. In this case, the return on reserves is high enough
to make the consumer indifferent between borrowing and saving in the deterministic steady-growth path. In other words, there is no opportunity cost
associated with accumulating reserves. Precautionary motives would then
induce the representative consumer to accumulate an unbounded level of reserves. If instead the carry cost is positive, accumulating reserves entails an
opportunity cost that ensures a finite target level.
The carry cost is a key variable that summarizes the combined effects
of the discount factor, the growth rate and the elasticity of intertemporal
substitution of consumption on the consumer’s willingness to borrow against
future income. The first-order condition (3) can be rewritten,


1/η−γ −1/η
Et
c
mt+1 .
ct
mt
=
1 + δ/(1 + r)
1 + r t+1
Thus δ summarizes all we need to know about β and G in the Euler equation. Because G appears in the budget constraint we keep it as a separate
parameter but we will treat the carry cost δ instead of the discount factor β
as the exogenous parameter.
Our definition of the carry cost is reminiscent of how the opportunity cost
of reserves is defined and measured in the literature, but there are interesting differences. First, the opportunity cost of reserves is often measured as
8

the quasi-fiscal cost of accumulating reserves for the central bank, measured
as the spread between the cost of issuing sterilization bonds—generally denominated in domestic currency—and the return on reserves (Frenkel and
Jovanovic, 1981; Flood and Marion, 2001). In the model this quasi-fiscal
cost can be written as the difference between the interest rate paid on the
domestic debt securities and the return on the reserves,
(1 + igt )

Et
− (1 + it ).
Et+1

(6)

Note that for consistency the two interest rates must be expressed in the
same currency. In (6) this currency is the dollar, which implies that the local
currency interest rate must be adjusted for depreciation.
The first-order condition for the consumer’s holding of government debt
is,


1/η−γ −1/η

(7)
1 + π t+1 Et+1 t+1
Assume for a moment that there is no exchange rate uncertainty one period
ahead, i.e., Et+1 is know in period t. Then comparing (3) and (7) shows that
uncovered interest parity applies,
1 + it = (1 + igt )

Et
.
Et+1

(8)

This implies that the quasi-fiscal cost given by (6) is equal to zero. Importantly, the reason that uncovered interest parity applies is not arbitrage by
private agents (since the market for domestic bonds is completely insulated
from the market for foreign bonds) but the optimizing behavior of the government. The government invests the reserves on behalf of the consumers and
should reproduce the same allocation as in the equilibrium with perfect financial integration. Hence the government should ensure that the private sector
receives the same real return on domestic securities as it would on foreign
securities, which implies that there is no quasi-fiscal cost of holding reserves.
A positive quasi-fiscal cost arises only if the government accumulates more
reserves than the private sector would under perfect financial integration.
This argument does not apply however if there is exchange rate risk. In
this case there will in general be a wedge in condition (6) that comes from
the exchange rate risk premium. In general the domestic interest rate could

9

be higher or lower than the level implied by uncovered interest parity, and if
it is higher there is a quasi-fiscal cost of holding the reserves.4
Irrespective of whether or not the government incurs a quasi-fiscal cost
for holding the reserves, this cost is not an appropriate measure of the welfare
cost of reserves for the country as a whole. In general the quasi-fiscal cost
given by (6) has no reason to be equal to the carry cost δ. The main reason
is that the quasi-fiscal cost is a cost for the government but a gain for the
holders of domestic bonds, who are domestic residents. The counterpart of
the fact that the government receives a lower return on the reserves than the
interest rate it pays on its debt is that the private sector receives a higher
return on its assets than if it directly held the reserves. The quasi-fiscal cost,
thus, can be viewed as a transfer to the private sector that the government
would not have to pay if it mandated the private sector to directly hold the
reserves, for example through liquidity regulation. It is not a welfare cost for
the country as a whole.
Another measure of the cost of reserves that is often used in the literature
is the difference between the interest rate on external debt and the return
on reserves.5 This does not coincide with the carry cost as defined in equation (5) because there is no presumption in general that a credit-constrained
borrower pays the interest rate that makes him willing to borrow the constrained amount. For example in many models of international capital flows a
credit-constrained open economy pays the riskless interest rate on its external
borrowing because of perfect competition between lenders and the absence
of default risk. In this case the difference between the external cost of borrowing and the return on reserves underestimates the true cost of holding
reserves. The external cost of borrowing may include a default risk premium
but it is not true in general that it should be included in the carry cost of
reserves (Jeanne, 2007).
To summarize, the carry cost given by (5) is a theoretical construct that
is not directly observable using market data because it involves a counterfactual interest rate, the interest rate that would be observed in the autarkic
steady-growth path. In our calibration the carry cost will result from the values assigned to fundamental preference parameters such as the consumer’s
4

There might be other reasons outside of the model for which the government might
be willing to incur a quasi-fiscal cost for holding reserves, for example if depreciating the
domestic currency has welfare benefits. See Korinek and Serven (2010), Rabe (2013),
Michaud and Rothert (2014).

See for example Edwards (1985), Rodrik (2006), Hauner (2006).

discount factor and risk aversion.
A final note of caution is that one should not confuse the target level of
reserves with the average level of reserves. The unconditional average level of
reserves based on stochastic simulations, E(b), is in general higher than the
target b∗ . One reason is the concavity in the policy function, which implies
that reserves converge towards the target at a faster pace when they are
below target than when they are above target. The zero-bound on reserves
is another reason for this result. For example, if the target level of reserves
is equal to zero the average level will be strictly higher than zero simply
because the level of reserves cannot be negative.

Calibration

The model is calibrated to a group of developing countries that receive relatively little private capital flows. Our country sample has all the countries
in the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) database such
that (i) long-term Public or Publicly-Guaranteed (PPG) debt represents at
least 75 percent of their total external debt; (ii) they are not classified as
fragile states in IMF (2014); and (iii) they have at least 15 consecutive years
of data. The first condition ensures that the countries in our sample have
a relatively low exposure to financial account shocks. The second condition
was imposed because we found the quality of the data to be low in fragile
states, and the last condition ensures that we have enough data to estimate
the exogenous stochastic processes. The resulting sample includes 21 countries: Bangladesh, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Egypt, Ethiopia, Gabon,
The Gambia, Kenya, Lesotho, Mauritania, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia,
Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Rwanda, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Uganda. The data
are annual from 1960 to 2014.
The WDI database provides volume and value indexes for both exports
and imports. These indexes give us respectively {Xt , Mt } and {PXt Xt , PM t Mt },
conditional on initial values. By dividing import values by import volumes
we can infer a price index PM t that we use to express export values in units
of imports, PXt Xt /PM t . The WDI also provides series for exports and GDP
in constant local currency units. Using the identity GDPtr = PX Xt + PN Nt ,
where GDPtr is real GDP in year t and the prices PX and PN are constant,
we construct an index for nontradable output Nt by subtracting gross real exports from real GDP. We then detrend exports (expressed in units of imports)
11

and nontradable output to obtain indexes that measure the time variations
in xt and nt .
In order to calibrate the model we need levels (and not only first-differences)
for the series xt and nt . Since the model is homogeneous of degree 1 in xt and
nt , we can normalize nt so that its average value is equal to 1 for each country.
The only piece of information that we then need to derive the whole path xt
is the ratio n/x in a given year. For this we divide the identity for nominal
GDP, GDPt = PXt Xt + PN t Nt by the nominal value of exports PXt Xt to
obtain,
nt P N t
GDPt
=1+
.
PXt Xt
x t PM t
We assume that the quantity of imported goods is expressed in a unit such
that, in a given base year t∗ , the prices of the nontradable good and the
imported good are equal to each other, PN t∗ = PM t∗ . This is without loss of
generality since the unit of nontradable good being given, it is always possible
to define the unit for the imported good so that this condition is satisfied.
We thus obtain the ratio nt∗ /xt∗ from
GDPt∗
nt∗

− 1.
xt∗
PXt∗ Xt∗
Note also that the restriction PN t∗ = PM t∗ can be used to determine the
value of α. Since the CES index (1) implies


we can express α as a function of the ratio of nominal expenditures on nontradable goods to nominal expenditures on imports in the base year,

PM t∗ Mt∗
We use the year t∗ =2005 for the normalization.
We then estimate AR(1) processes for the series {xt , nt } for each country
in our sample. The table below reports the average autocorrelation coefficient and standard deviation in our country sample. More precisely, the
table reports the values of y, ρ and σ from the AR(1) regression yt − y =
ρ (yt−1 − y) + εt where σ 2 is the variance of ε and y is the column variable.
We find that the value of exports in terms of imports is more volatile but

less persistent than nontradable output. We also estimate an AR(1) process
for the imports own real rate of interest, 1 + rt = (1 + it−1 )/(1 + π t ) where
it is the one-year eurobond interest rate in U.S. dollars. The imports own
rate of interest is equal to 3.6% on average. This interest rate exhibits little
persistence and significant volatility because the price of imports is volatile.
The estimated autoregressive processes reported in Table 1 are used to
calibrate the model. We approximate each process using the method of
Tauchen and Hussey (1991) with five gridpoints for export income and three
gridpoints for non-traded income and the real interest rate.6
The other parameters in our benchmark calibration are reported in Table
2. The value for risk aversion (γ = 2) is standard in the literature. The value
of α is the cross-country average of the ratio of nominal expenditures on
nontradable good to nominal expenditures on imports in 2005, as explained
above. The elasticity of substitution between tradable goods and nontradable
goods is set to 1, a value that is standard in the literature. The growth factor
is calibrated to the average growth in nontradable output and in the value
of exports in terms of imports in the data. The average growth rates in n
and x are respectively 4.3% and 4.9% in our sample. In the model these
growth rates are assumed to be the same and we set its value to 4.6%.7 The
6

The number of gridpoints is not indifferent because the model predictions depend on
the lowest value for x in the grid. The Tauchen-Hussey method implies that the lowest
point in the grid decreases with the number of gridpoints, and even becomes negative if
the number of gridpoints is too large. With five gridpoints the lowest value of x is 70%
below the average level of x under our benchmark calibration. In our country sample the
lowest value of x is on average 48% below x̄.
7
One issue is that the growth rate is higher than the interest rate. This cannot be
true forever otherwise the country would not have a well-defined intertemporal budget
constraint. The implicit assumption maintained in the rest of the paper is that the growth
rate will fall at a distant point in the future. We also experimented with a model where
trend growth falls to a lower level with a small probability in every period, and obtained
similar results. Although stochastic growth introduces an additional source of risk which

value for the discount factor is within the range considered in the literature
for models with growth. If the global interest rate were determined by the
deterministic steady-growth path of advanced economies growing at 2% per
year, it would be equal to 1.022 /β−1 = 5.1%. The sensitivity of the results to
these parameter values will be discussed in the next section. The benchmark
calibration implies that the carry cost of reserves is equal to δ = 6.9%.

Quantitative Results

We analyze the quantitative predictions of the model in three steps. First, we
look at the model predictions for the target and average levels of reserves. We
then consider how reserves optimally adjust in response to shocks. Finally, we
analyze the performance of simple linear rules to manage reserves. We report
our results using the reserves-to-imports ratio in months, ρt = 12 ∗ bt /mt ,
as this is a standard measure of reserves adequacy. The average reservesto-imports ratio, E(ρ), is the average value of ρ taken over five thousand
200-period simulations of the model. The target reserves-to-imports ratio,
ρ∗ , is the ratio b∗ /m∗ where b∗ and m∗ are the long-run levels of reserves and
imports respectively in the model without shocks.

4.1

Target and average levels of reserves

Under our benchmark calibration the average level of reserves E(ρ) is equal to
4.6 months of imports and the target level of reserves ρ∗ is equal to 3.3 months
of imports. The average amount of reserves predicted by the model is quite
close to average level of reserves in the data (4.5 months of imports) and the
target is close to the 3-months-of-imports rule of thumb. This coincidence is
remarkable as we did not use any data about reserves to calibrate the model.
Is this a fluke, or do plausible calibrations tend to deliver similar results?
could in principle affect the level of precautionary savings, we found this effect to be

Figure 1 shows how the target and average levels of reserves vary with the
carry cost δ, risk aversion γ, the elasticity of substitution η, and the share
of imports in consumption α. The average level of reserves is always higher
than the target for the reasons explained at the end of section 2.2.

Figure 1: Sensitivity of reserves target ρ∗ and average reserves E[ρ].
The most important parameter is the carry cost δ. In Figure 1 we change
the carry cost, given the other parameters, by adjusting the discount factor
β. The target and average levels of reserves both decreases with the carry
cost. The figure shows the variation of reserves when the carry cost remains
above 2 percent. The target level of reserves diverges to infinity as the carry
cost goes to zero, and already exceeds 15 months of imports when the carry
cost is equal to 2 percent. However under our benchmark calibration the
carry cost cannot fall below 5.8 percent if the discount factor β stays below
1. For this level of the carry cost the average level of reserves amounts to 6.1
months of imports, and the reserves target to 4.6 months of imports.
We also consider the sensitivity of the target to the risk aversion parameter γ that we vary between 1 and 5, a range of values often considered in the
literature. The results depend on whether we hold constant the carry cost
δ or the discount factor β. If we keep δ constant by adjusting β, changes
in γ capture purely the effect of risk aversion. In this case, higher values of
15

γ make the consumer more willing to smooth consumption against shocks
and so increase the desired level of reserves. If instead we do not adjust
β, increasing γ also makes the consumer less elastic intertemporally, which
increases the carry cost of foreign assets and decreases the target. On one
hand, increasing γ above 2 does not have a significant impact on the optimal
level of reserves because the impact of higher risk aversion is offset by that of
a lower elasticity of intertemporal elasticity. When γ increases the consumer
is more willing to hold reserves for insurance but at the same time eager
to borrow against future income and these two effects broadly cancel out.
On the other hand, reducing risk aversion below 2 significantly increases the
optimal level of reserves: the average level of reserves increases to almost 15
months of imports if γ is equal to 1.
The reserves target decreases with the elasticity of substitution between
tradable and nontradable goods η. When the two goods are more substitutable the marginal utility of consumption is less sensitive to the consumption of imported goods, which reduces the benefits of precautionary savings.
Finally, raising the share of imports in consumption increases the country’s
exposure to external shocks and so the desired level of reserves.
To conclude, the results from our benchmark calibration are robust in
the sense that they are not very sensitive to increasing risk aversion above
2 or changing the consumer’s discount rate, as long as it remains positive.
However, reducing risk aversion below 2 significantly increases the optimal
level of reserves. If β and γ are both equal to 1 (the combination of values in
the plausible set that maximizes the optimal level of reserves), the optimal
level of reserves amounts to about 30 months of imports on average.

Impulse response functions

Having analyzed the model implications for the target and average level of
reserves, we now turn to the predicted dynamics. Figure 2 shows the impulse response functions of imports and reserves to shocks in export income,
nontradable output and the real interest rate.8 Imports fall by 20 percent
in response to a 30 percent fall in export income because the government
runs down reserves by more than one and a half months of imports. Shocks
in nontraded output have a smaller impact—a 20 percent fall in nontraded
8

Under our Tauchen-Hussey discretization, the simulated export shock occurs with 22
percent probability, while the nontradable output and real interest rates shocks occur with
17 percent probability.

16

output reduces reserves by about one half of a month of imports. The lowest
panel shows the impulse responses to a negative shock in the ex-post imports
own real rate of interest. Shocks in this variable reflect mostly unexpected
changes in the dollar price of imported goods (there are also shocks in the
dollar nominal interest rate, it , but they are much less volatile than shocks in
PM t ). An unexpected increase in the price of imports decreases both imports
and reserves.

Figure 2: Impulse response functions (% change if not otherwise specified)
Overall, most of the variation in reserves is explained by shocks to export
income rather than the other two variables. Table 3 shows the contribution
of each shock to the variance in b. For example, the number in the column
labeled x is the variance of b in simulations of the model assuming that the
only shocks are in x while n and r are set to their average values. The last
column reports the variance of b when all three shocks are present. It appears
that most of the variance in reserves is explained by the variance in export
income x.
Finally, we compare in Figure 3 the unconditional distribution of reserves
in the model and in the data (left-hand-side and right-hand-side panels respectively). The figure shows the distribution of the ratio of reserves to their

average level. In the model reserves spend a substantial amount of time close
to the zero lower bound but there is also a relatively fat tail of observations
with very high levels of reserves. The figure does not give the visual impression that the government tries to keep reserves close to a target. By contrast
reserves stay relatively close to their average level in the data. Governments
in the real world seem to be more concerned about keeping reserves close to
a target than what would seem optimal based on the model. The reluctance
of emerging markets and developing countries to run down their reserves in
response to bad shocks has been noted in the literature (Aizenman and Sun,
2012). A possible explanation is the fear of sending a bad public signal about
the state of the economy.

Linear rules

The policy function for reserve management predicted by the model is nonlinear and therefore difficult to describe as a simple rule of thumb for practitioners. In this section, we look for simple policy rules that deliver most
of the welfare gains from optimal reserves management. As shown in the
previous section, the model predicts that reserves should be mostly used in
response to shocks xt . Therefore, we consider a simple linear rule according
18

to which reserves have to converge towards a target bb while buffering export
shocks xt



The parameter λ is the marginal propensity to save export income and the
parameter µ captures the speed of convergence of reserves towards the target
bb. This rule encompasses certainty equivalence as a special case. Certainty
equivalence corresponds to the case where there is no reserves target (µ = 0)
and the value of λ is determined by the fact that imports follow a random
walk. In this case reserves bt are nonstationary.
We then look for the values of λ, µ and bb that maximize average welfare
based on a large number of simulations.9 Under our benchmark calibration
we find
bb = 0.22, λ = 0.35, µ = 0.2.
Figure 4 illustrates how the optimized linear rule for reserves (dashed lines)
compares to the non-linear rule (continuous lines) for alternative values of export income. The linear rule approximates fairly well the non-linear rule when
precautionary motives are weaker, i.e., at high levels of export income and
reserves. However, there are visible discrepancies when income and reserves
are low because the optimal policy function becomes particularly nonlinear.

More specifically, we run Montecarlo simulations starting from the stochastic distribution of reserves under the non-linear policy functions. These simulations are conducted
assuming that countries follow the linear rule (9) for various combinations of the parameters {λ, µ, bb}. Finally, we select the parameters that return the highest average welfare
across simulations.

19

The optimal target is a little larger than in the non-linear policy (0.22
instead of 0.18). Since a linear rule provides less buffering to shocks, it is
thus preferable to hold a somewhat higher stock of reserves. Furthermore, the
value for λ implies that in any given period the country should accumulate
in reserves 35 percent of its export income in excess of the average. This is
significantly lower than the value implied by certainty equivalence, which we
show in the appendix to be given by
λCE =

(1 − ρx ) G
,
1 + r − ρx G

where ρx is the autocorrelation coefficient in export income. In this formula
the growth factor G must be set to [β (1 + r)]1/γ , the level that makes the
consumer willing to let his consumption increase by the factor G in the deterministic steady-growth path. Under our benchmark calibration the implied
value for the marginal propensity to save is λCE = 0.907.
Another difference with certainty equivalence is that reserves converge to
the target relatively quickly: deviations from the target have a half-life of
about three years. This is much quicker than the speed of convergence to the
target in calibrated version of models à la Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2003).
In these models the behavior of foreign assets is essentially the one implied
by certainty equivalence except for a weak force that prevents foreign assets
from being nonstationary. We find that this is not a good approximation to
optimal reserves management in our model.
The reason for the difference with certainty equivalence is that in our
model the representative consumer is caught between two strong opposite
forces: a strong desire to borrow (because income growth is high) and a strong
desire to insure (because export income is volatile). The tension between
these two forces lead the consumer to use reserves more sparingly than under
certainty equivalence. On the one hand, the propensity to save on a positive
export income shock is significantly smaller than under certainty equivalence
because the consumer is impatient. On the other hand, the propensity to
dissave following a negative export income shock is also smaller than under
certainty equivalence because the consumer is reluctant to approach the zero
bound on reserves—where there no longer is insurance.
In welfare terms, we find that our optimized linear rule performs well,
as it captures most of the welfare gains from reserve management under the
non-linear rule. Let us denote by Umax the level of welfare when reserves are
used optimally, and by Umin the average level of welfare when reserves are

simply set to zero. Optimal reserves management (increasing welfare from
Umin to Umax ) has the same impact on welfare as a permanent increase in
consumption by 0.57 percent. This is smaller than the welfare gain from
turning off the stochastic shocks, which is close to a 5 percent permanent
increase in consumption. The latter estimate is larger than typical estimates
of the welfare cost from the business cycle because export income is volatile
in our sample of developing countries.10
Let us denote by Ulin the average welfare under the linear rule. We express
the welfare gain from the linear rule as a share of the gain from unconstrained
optimal reserves management, i.e., as the ratio
Ulin − Umin
.
Umax − Umin
We find that the best linear rule provides 91.3 percent of the welfare gains
from the best nonlinear rule.
We also consider how the welfare gains from the linear rule vary with the
parameters. Contrary to the emphasis that practitioners tend to place on
the optimal level of reserves, we find that the precise level of the target bb is
not very important for welfare. The left chart in Figure 5 shows that welfare
under the linear rule is remarkably insensitive to the level of the target bb
(in the figure the target varies between zero and 2b∗ ). It is instead much
more important to set the values of λ and µ at the appropriate levels, and
10

Pallage and Robe (2003) find that removing income and consumption volatility is
equivalent to increasing consumption by 12.1 percent in the median country in their sample
of developing countries (see their Table 3 for θ = γ = 2, sample with the US). This is a
multiple of the welfare cost of the business cycle in advanced economies as measured by
Lucas (1987).

21

especially not to set them too low. This suggests that the level of the target
is much less consequential for welfare than how the government accumulates
and deccumulates reserves in response to shocks.
The target level bb has also minor implications for the optimal values of
λ and µ. This is illustrated in Figure 6, which shows that a higher value
for bb implies only small changes in the optimal levels of λ and µ. Therefore,
policy makers can focus on the appropriate use of reserves in response to
shocks independently of the optimal reserve target.

We did not find asymmetric rules to be very beneficial for welfare. Allowing
for asymmetry in the speed of convergence µ raises welfare by 0.5 percent
of the welfare gains from the best nonlinear rule. Similarly, allowing for
asymmetry in λ raises welfare by only 0.9 percent of the welfare gains from
the best nonlinear rule.

Conclusion

We presented an intertemporal optimization model to study the optimal management of reserves for financially closed countries facing current account
shocks. The fact that the model is welfare-based has allowed us to rigorously
define the opportunity cost of reserves and clarify differences with conventional metrics used in the literature. On the quantitative side, we found that
22

plausible calibrations give results that are remarkably close to both the average level of reserves in the data and the 3-months-of-imports rule of thumb.
However, real-world governments seem to be excessively cautious in their use
of reserves—the model suggests a more active use of reserves in response
to shocks. The welfare gains from reserves management come from using
the reserves rather than keeping them close to the target. We also showed
that simple linear rules can capture most of the welfare gains from reserve
management and thus provide helpful guidance to practitioners. Finally, we
pointed out that it is more important to properly adjust reserves in response
to shocks than choosing a particular reserve target.
Several directions of research could be pursued in future work. First, it
would be interesting to separate risk aversion from the elasticity of intertemporal substitution of consumption by using Epstein-Zin preferences. Second,
one could introduce other shocks such as demand shocks in the discount factor. Finally it would be interesting to explore how the model can be applied
to the optimal management of commodity funds and sovereign wealth funds.
