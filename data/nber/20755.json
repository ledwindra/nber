    "abstract": "\n\nIn this paper, we describe the evolution of the Federal Reserve\u2019s swap lines from their inception in 1962 as a mechanism to forestall claims on U.S gold reserves under Bretton Woods to a means of extending emergency dollar liquidity during the Great Recession.  We describe a number of consequences associated with swap operations.  We argue, for example, that swaps calm crisis situations by both supplementing foreign countries\u2019 dollar reserves and by signaling central-bank cooperation.  We show how swaps exposed the Federal Reserve to conditionality and raised fears that they bypassed the Congressional appropriations process.\n\n",
