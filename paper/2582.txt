Debt and Conditionality under
Endogenous Terms of Trade Adjustment

ASSTDACT

The purpose of this study is to identify conditions under which
renewed international lending will benefit both the developed and the
developing countries. Our analysis will evaluate how the presence of
terms of trade adjustient and distorted credit markets affect the
conditions for the existence of beneficial lending.

We demonstrate

that in the presence of endogenous terms of trade adjustment, there
are cases in which a competitive international banking systen nay not
revitalize lending for investment purposes, even if such renewed

lending is socially desirable

Renewed lending nay require the

appropriate conditionality, and the presence of endogenous terms of
trade adjustment puts greater weight on investment conditionality.

Introduction

The international capital market is presently characterized by
effective credit rationing to developingcountries.

Most developing

countries cannot obtain new credits from the international banking
system.

This situation is in sharp contrast with the 1970's, when the

international banking system engaged willingly in substantial resource

transfer to the developing countries.

This remarkable switch from a

functioning international credit market to a market characterized by
credit rationing reflects the growing awareness of the country risk
involved in further lending to developing countries.

Most developing

countries have reached a point where their willingness or ability to
service their debt is questionable, thereby increasing the reluctance
of the international banking system to extend new credits.

This

situation is further complicated by the drop in export prices
experienced by the developing nations in recent years, a process that
has further reduced their ability and willingness to service their
debt.

A

significant literature has evolved in recent years which

attempts to study the unique characteristics of international country
risk.

The lack of simple enforcement mechanisms for international

debt repayment tends to degenerate the international credit market
into an equilibrium where the volume of international credit is
limited by the effective penalties associated with defaults.

These

penalties are potential embargoes that would restrict the flow of both
temporal and intertemporal trade (i.e., trade in goods and financial
assets, respectively)

While the above literature has provided clues regarding the
problems of country risk, it has raised important policy questions of
what can be (Or should

be) done in the present situation characterized

by "over—borrowing" and debt overhang.2 An open question is the
degree to which the international system will be capable of
revitalizing the resource transfer for investment purposes from the
developed to the developing nations.

The purpose of this paper is to identify conditions under which
renewed lending may benefit both the developed and the developing
countries.

We evaluate how the presence of endogenous terms of trade

effects--that is, a situation in which terms of trade between debtor

and creditor nations are significantly affected by the financial flows
between them——affects the conditions for the existence of beneficial
lending.

This analysis has special relevance because a competitive

international banking system does not internalize terms of trade
effects, and may not revitalize lending for investment purposes, even
in situations in which renewed lending is socially desirable.

This

may suggest an important role for policy-makers in imposing the
appropriate conditionality

(i.e., by imposing guidelines regarding the

domestic policies that should follow renewed lending).

We will

attempt to evaluate conditions under which such a role is desirable.

We start our analysis by reviewing the behavior of the terms of
trade of developing nations in recent years.

The relevance of terms

of trade effects for the debt situation depends mainly on the
existence of a less than perfectly elastic demand for developing
countries' exports.

Existing econometric studies conclude that

developing countries face a downward—sloping demand curve for their
exports, at least when taken as a group.

2

In addition, the sharp

deterioration in terms of trade of debtor countries since the start of

the debt crisis, and the recent behavior of commodity prices suggest
the existence of a strong connection between terms of trade changes
and the debt situation.

We continue our analysis by describing a model of the
international credit market which is characterized by insolvency on

the part of debtor countries.

This means that repayments do not

suffice to cover all obligations, and therefore become nore closely
related to available resources in the debtor economy than to existing
debt.

As a consequence, the debtor countries cannot borrow as much as

they would like to3, and find themselves credit rationed.

In these

circumstances, we assume that debtors and creditors negotiate
'contracts' that offer increased lending based on some conditions on
the use of the resources agreed to by the debtor country, and on the
extent of the attachment of the debtors output to repayment.

This

simple framework is intended to capture some of the main features of
the current rescheduling negotiation process.

The debt negotiations are assumed to take place in the context of
a two—period, two—good world economy composed of two blocks of
nations:

creditors and debtors.

new investment in the second period.

A

contract is a

'Pareto—improving contract' if both blocks of nations benefit from the

marginal resource transfers.

We obtain the conditions for the

existence of Pareto contracts, and describe them.
In the absence of terms of trade effects (perfect
substitutability between the two goods) the key results can be
summarized in the following way.

The conditioflguaranteeing the

existence of Pareto contracts is that the marginal productivity of
capital in the developing countries should exceed that in the
developed countries.

In the absence cf iistortions

(other than the

international credit market insolvency situation) this condition is
identical to the requirement that the interest rate be higher in the
developing than in the developed nations.

The larger the excess of

the marginal productivity of capital in the developed countries, the
larger the range of Pareto contracts,

The presumption is that this

condition is indeed satisfied because the interest rate in the heavily
indebted countries tends to be higher than in
countries.

Nevertheless,

on the

We show that the Pareto region is

enlarged for strict conditionality contracts (contracts that require
high marginal propensity to invest in the debtor country) and is
reduced for contracts requiring low marginal propensity to invest on
the part of the debtor country.

We also analyze an alternative type

of contract between debtors and creditors.

In this case the amount of

the repayment is the only variable to be agreed upon, and investment
is assumed to be undertaken in an optimal manner by the developing
country.

We show how, in this framework, the existence of endogenous

II.

The Empirical Relevance of Terms of Trade Effects

The relevance of terms of trade effects for the debt situation
depends on the answer to the following question: do debtor countries
face a downward—sloping

demand curve for their export products?

are two reasons to believe that they do.

There

The first is that although

perhaps all debtor countries can be considered small economies, often
they are all simultaneously affected by the same shocks, and their
joint response is of a large magnitude.

For example, the increasing

unavailability of foreign borrowing since 1982 affected most debtor
countries; their response included a generalized increase in exports,
and a terms of trade deterioration followed.4

This means that even

if the actions of each individual debtor country cannot affect its
terms of trade, on occasions the debtor country may find falling

prices every time it tries to increase the volume of its exports
because other debtor countries are doing the same.

The second reason is that an increasing portion of debtor
countries' exports are manufactured products, the markets for which
are, in many cases, well described by a differentiated products
structure,

In a differentiated—products

framework (such as Spence

(l976)) there is a whole continuum of goods that can be produced by

power6

If this is the case, the

manufactured exports from debtor countries will face a
downward—sloping

demand curve, irrespective of

size considerations.

Econometric studies of the elasticity cf demand for developing
country exports by industrial economies have usually taken developing
countries as

a

group.

Estimates of this import demand elasticity

range from somewhat less than 1 to over 4,7 The studies use,
however, different aggregations for the definition of the import
commodity, and different aggregations for the importer economy, apart
from different sample periods.

Despite that fact, it appears that a

number slightly above 1 is a reasonable synthesis of econometric
estimates of import demand elaSticity.

It is interesting to note that

the median (across products) elasticity estimated by Grossman (1982)
is equal to 1.2, the median (across countries) elasticityestimated by
Marquez and McNeilly (1987) is also equal to 1.2, and the elasticity
estimated by Dornbusch (1985) for the aggregate of non—oil developing

countries is also equal to l.2. Such a figure is also in line with
estimates of import price elasticities for industrial goods
irrespective of the country of origin of exports (see Goldstein and

Khan (1985)). This elasticity applies, however, to the aggregate of

6

developing country exports, although for some particular goods, a few
exporters account for most of the supply.
In fact, the evolution of the terms of trade of the group of
fifteen heavily indebted countries appears to reflect quite strongly
the debt problems faced by them since 1982, as suggested by the data
displayed in Table 1.

Sin'e 1982, the combined non-interest current

account for this group of countries displays a sharp turnaround.

The

non—interest current account, that averaged a deficit of over $2
billion in the period 1968—81, moved to an average surplus of over $32
billion during 1982-87.

This turnaround reflects the loss of access

to international credit from private sources of many debtor countries.

At the same time, these fifteen debtor countries experienced a sharp
deterioration in terms of trade, a cumulative 22 percent relative to
1981 levels.

Despite that deterioration, the volume of exports showed

a cumulative increase of over 10 percent in the same period.
In addition to the general picture portrayed by Table 1, there
are other pieces of evidence that indicate an interaction between the
foreign debt situation and terms of trade developments.

One of these

is the behavior of the prices of non-oil commodities produced by

developing countries.

Despite continuous economic expansion in

industrial countries the relative price of non—oil commodities fell
sharply since 1983.

Econometric studies have often found that non—oil

commodity prices can be explained well by business cycle developments
in industrial countries and the dollar exchange rate (see Dornbusch
(1985)). However, since 1983, there appears to be break in
traditional relationships, (Morrison and Wattleworth,
1, that

Chart

plots an index of industrial production and the relative price

of non—oil commodities since 1975, also suggests the existence of such

7

break in the relationship between these two variables,
An additional piece of evidence concerns the differentiated
products argument.

A large part of the increase in debtor countries'

exports since 1982 consisted of manufactures, among which there are a
number of goods which can easily fit the differentiated products
description.

Although disaggregated data on price and quantity

indices of industrial exports are hard to obtain, there exists
published information in the case of Chile.

These data do show large

increases in the volume of industrial exports accompanied by sharp
drops in prices, as displayed in Table 2.

Since 1982, the volume of

manufactured exports grew by a cumulative 76 percent.

However, this

growth required deep cuts in prices, and the dollar prices of
manufactured exports fell by a cumulative 36 percent.

Relative to the

prices of manufactures exported by industrial countries, the fall in

export prices is even larger.

their own imports, however, the decrease is smaller, which is partly
explained by the decrease in commodity prices and in prices of exports
originated in other developing countries.

In addition, we conjecture

that there might be a quality effect hidden in the data,

As imports

became more expensive and real income adjusted downwards, there might
have been a switch towards lower quality products in imports.

This

interpretation is suggested by a disaggregation of import price data,

which shows a very sharp decrease in the prices of consumption good
imports, and only a slight decrease in the prices of capital good
imports.

A

Framework of Analysis

The purpose of our analysis is to identify conditions under which
an increase in the resource transfer from developed to developing
countries would be beneficial, and to study the consequences of
eridogenous terms of trade adjustment.

The simplest framework to deal

with these issues is a two-period, two—good world economy composed of
two blocks of nations: developed and developing nations.

Each block

produces one good, and consumes both. For simplicity of exposition it
is convenient to assume that in the long-run the relative price of the
two goods is exogenously fixed by the technology of production.

In

the short-run the supply is given, and the relative price of the two
goods is determined by the prevailingdemand conditions.

We will

identify the short run with the first period, and the long run with
the second.

The

output level is exogenously given in period one. In the second
period, the output level is determinedby investment carried out in
period one, which is denoted by I.

We assume an asymmetric

environment: good X can be either consumed or invested to increase the
future output of both good X and Y, while good Y can only be used for
consumption purposes.

The investment technologies also differ.

In

the developed economy, second—period output is linked to investment

economic authority, and it is the subject of bargaining between debtor
and creditor.

In the absence of distortions——other than the international

equate the marginal product of capital (m) to the interest rate
(l+r*)

In the presence of distortions, the term in brackets is a

measure of the distortion wedge, and the change in welfare is
proportional to the distortion times the change in the distorted

(fi)

Note that the overall change in world welfare is

proportional to the marginal investment rate in the developing
country.

If no new investment is triggered by the transfer there are

no aggregate wealth changes.

We start our analysis considering the limiting case in which the
two goods are perfect substitutes (dQ/dB =

0),

and we will later

evaluate the consequences of imperfect substitutability

on the region

of Pareto contracts.

Pareto-Improving Contracts with Perfect Substitutability

To obtain the region of Pareto—improving contracts we start by

tracing an indifference curve on the
locus of the pairs of values of

This curve is the

for which the country is

indifferent with respect to (marginal) additional lending.

The curve

forms the boundary of the region where the country benefits from a
marginal increase in the resource transfer.

17

The area between the two curves in Figure 1 defines the Pareto
contracts.

The condition that guarantees the existence of

Paretoimproving contracts is that the marginal productivity of
capital in the developing countries exceeds that in the developed
countries.

The greater is the excess of the marginal productivity of

capital, the greater is the area of Pareto contracts.

There is a strong presumption that this condition for the
existence of Paretoimproving contracts is indeed satisfied in the
real world, because interest rates in heaviiyindebted countries tend
to be much higher than in creditor countries, and presumably the
divergence of the marginal product of capital with respect to the
interest rate is not so large,

However, also in a real world

situation, the marginal resource transfer will not occur in the
absence of proper incentives or of conditionality on the debtor
country to satisfy the terms (,x) of the contract.

Pareto-Improving Contracts with Imperfect Substitutability

Under limited goods substitutability, an increase in the resource
transfer will have some impact on terms of trade.

In the next

section, we develop a model that determines the terms of trade effect
explicitely.

In the meantime, an approximate analysis can be made

using only information on the sign of dQ/dB.14

The set of contracts for which

developing countries are willing to receive additional resources is in
fact smaller.

Some contracts in the upper-left part of the unit

square are no longer beneficial because the welfare effect of the
terms of trade deterioration offsets the additional consumption
possibilities generated by the increased lending.

In contrast, the

set of contracts for which developed nations are willing to increase
lending is now larger, because the existence of a relative price
effect is favorable to the developed countries.
We conclude that a deterioration in the terms of trade of

developing countries has the consequence of shifting the location of
the Pareto region leftwards and downwards.

This means that the

developed countries may obtain "softer conditionality terms, because
part of the economic repayment is implemented via terms of trade
adjustment.

This effect would be larger the lower is the

substitutability between the two goods.

It is noteworthy that from

the point of view of the banking system the curve CC continues to be
the relevant contract indifference curve.

This has the potential

consequence that at the negotiation process the interests of the

banking system may diverge from those of the other parties.

There

exist some contracts that are Pareto-improving but are associated with
losses to the banking system.

role in the process for policy actions to provide international banks

The developing countries will now be

willing to accept some contracts that produce a negative payoff when

improvement more than compensate for that,

creditor countries, however, the set of beneficial contracts is now
smaller,

This would be a situation in which the creditor country

would attempt to regulate banks in order to restrain them from
increasing lending under some contracts that generate profits for the
banks but make the creditor country worse off.
Consequently, the impact of endogenous terms of trade is

determined by the direction of the terms of trade adjustment to the
marginal increase in credit.

We now turn to study the factors

determining the sign of dQ/dB.

A Model Linking Terms of Trade to International Lending

The framework of lending and investment is as described above,
and the budget constraints

Therefore, a is equal to the elasticity of demand with respect to

Regarding investment demand, we assume an assymetric structure.

Therefore, in the creditor country, investment is the

By contrast, in the debtor country, investment is

determined by the economic authority, as explained above.

Adjustment to an Increase in Net Borrowing

Given the demand and supply structure detailed above, the
equilibrium of the system can be represented in the following way.

In

period one, with the credit constraint binding, consumption in the
debtor country cannot exceed the exogenous limit
+ B — 1*. The

domestic interest rate adjusts to obtain that level of consumption.
The distribution of consumption across goods is given by (19) and
(20).

In the developed economy, consumption is set according to the

level of wealth but, given the exogeneity of B, the investment level I
has to adjust to satisfy the first-period budget constraint.

In the second period, there is effectively only one good, since

Equilibrium can then be represented by equations (23), (or (24)),
(27), and (28)

These equilibrium conditions determine the value of

the following endogenous variables: the first period terms of trade,
the interest rate in the developing countries, and investment in the
*
developed countries (Q, r , and I). The levels of net borrowing B,
and of investment by the debtor country 1* are exogenously determined
in the debt negotiation process.
Suppose now that the developed nations initiate a marginal
increase in the available credit (dB >

0),

and let us evaluate the

normative and positive aspects of the adjustment to such an increase
in lending.

The response of the terms of trade to the increase in

lending, evaluated at Q

An Alternative Framework 22

The model above assumed that debtors and creditors negotiate over
the addition to investment () and to repayment (x) that should be
attached to an increase in lending.

Such framework appears to be in

line with observed behavior in the recent rescheduling negotiations.

Often in those negotiations, some conditionality on the debtor
country's policies——usually

within the framework of

program——is part of the agreement.
conditionality is represented as

a

. In

addition,

negotiations determine how much is paid and how much is rescheduled, a
decision that is highly dependent on the economic performance of the
debtor. In the model, this is represented by the parameter x•
It can be argued, however, that negotiating over (8,) is not the

best policy for the creditor.

The creditor could leave the investment

decision entirely up to the debtor, which (in the absence of
distortions in the debtor economy) would maximize second—period output
if the proper incentives are in place.

In order to provide such

proper incentives, repayment should be agreed as a fixed amount,
because then the debtor can keep the return to any increase in
investment that it achieves.23

The alternative framework for negotiations would therefore not
attach policy conditionality to the increased lending.

In the absence

of domestic distortions, investment in the debtor economy would
therefore be determined by equating the marginal product of capital to

condition for the existence of a non—empty Pareto—improving region.
In Figure 3 we plot the region of Pareto—improving contracts as a
function of a, which represents the degree of substitutability
the two goods.

between

In the limit, as a goes to infinity and the two goods

are perfect substitutes, there is no terms of trade effect, and the
Pareto region is as described above.

In contrast, for finite values

of a, creditor countries require a value of Z exceeding l+r to engage
in further lending, and debtor countries accept a value of Z higher
*
than l+r , because the terms of trade effect benefits the debtor
country.
These results qualify the conclusions from the previous
framework, in the sense that if investment is done in an optimal
manner in the debtor country and debt negotiations provide the correct
incentives to achieve such investment, there are no contracts that the

creditor country would be willing to engage in that would not be
achieved by a decentralized banking system.

But, in addition, there

is a set of contracts under which the decentralized banking system

would engage in further borrowing that are not optimal from the point
of view of the representative consumer in the creditor economy.
Ultimately, the relevance of this and the previous framework depends

on an explicit account of the reasons for credit rationing and

28

under—investment.

We suspect that the existence of defensive lending,

different time horizons between governments and the private sector,
distorted capital markets, and asymmetric information make the
conclusions of the former framework the more relevant ones.

Concluding Remarks

tne redistributive versus the efficiency

The purpose of our analysis was to highlight the potential

efficiency losses emerging from the drop in investment in the
developing countries due to the presence of credit rationing, and to
investigate mechanisms to revitalize tne investment process.

The

analysis focused on the case where there are two dimensions for the
conditionality:

the determination of the marginal propensityto

invest out of the new funds and of the marginal propensity to repay
out of future output.

We demonstrated the potential trade of f between

these two dimensions and pointed out that endogenous terms of trade
adjustment gives greater weight to investment conditionality.

We now

close the paper with some interpretive comments regarding
qualifications and extensions.
Our discussion demonstrated that (in the absence of strict
investment conditionality) renewed lending to developing countries
tends to be associated with an improvement in the terms of trade of
the developing countries and vice versa.

29

This is consistent with the

terms of trade deterioration observed in recent years.

In the

eighties, there was a switch from a regime that transferred resources
to the developing countries to
the developing countries.

a

regime that transfers resources from

The importance of the terms of trade

adjustment stems from the observation that it has first-order welfare
effects on the consumers in the creditor and debtor nations, despite
the fact that it is not internalized by the private banking system.
There are some qualifications to our results in this paper.

The

framework developed in the paper considers debt and credit rationing
at the global level.

Even if each indebted country has limited market

power in its products, the group of indebted countries as a whole has
significant market power.

Because most indebted countries are facing

presently similar constraints, we have used an aggregate version of a
two-block world--creditors

and debtors.

However, if it is only the

collective response of debtor countries that is large enough to
produce terms of trade changes, individual debtor countries would not
be willing to accept a less favorable contract in consideration of the
terms of trade effect.

If this is the case, the set of contracts

acceptable to debtors is not changed by the existence of a terms of
trade effect of increased lending.

Another qualification is that it

is not entirely clear that the decisions of economic authorities are
consistent with the representative consumer's interest when it comes
to issues such as terms of trade changes.

It appears that the

protection of import-competing industries in industrial countries may
be, in fact,

more important for the authorities.

This last point suggests an interesting extension to the present
framework.

Some consistency is required between the conditionality

attached to renewed credit and commercial policies adopted in the two

30

blocks of countries, particularly in the creditor countries.

Even in

the absence of renewed lending, repayment of past loans will require

Consistent commercial policy (i.e., intensive application of quotas
may defeat any sincere attempt for debt repayment).

This suggests

that the incorporation of commercial policy actions to the policies
considered in the debt negotiation process could have important
implications for the design of mutually advantageous debt contracts.

means that the change in the interest rate in the developing nations

In fact, neither the

domestic nor the foreign interest rate affect wealth of the debtor
country.

This is a consequence of the credit rationing/insolvency

situation.

This linear technology serves the purpose of isolating

intertemporal marginal rates of substitution in the developed economy

Our analysis can be extended to the case where r is endogenously
determined, without affecting the logic of our discussion.
19

The derivation is contained in the Appendix.

20

Note that, for

a <

I,

in the absence of new investment we get an

improvement in the terms of trade of developing countries due to the
"local habitat" effect.

This is in line with the classical transfer

criterion (for analysis using transfer considerations see Frenkel and

Razin (1987) and van Wijnbergen (1988)). Note also that, with a
unitary marginal investment ( = 1), the terms of trade adjustment is
independent of any local habitat effect.
21

The closer substitutes goods X and Y are, the smaller the terms of

trade change that would occur, and the smaller the shift in the CC
curve.

This

can be seen from equation (32), where the elasticity of

substitution is positivaly associated with c.

Also, the larger the

local habitat effect (smaller a) the larger the impact of the terms of
trade change on the Pareto region (i.e. the larger the shift in Cc).
