ABSTRACT
We develop a model of the world economy as input-output relationships subject to distortions.
We then propose a methodology to solve the identification problem, common to the literature on
misallocation in input-output relationships, of separating sectoral TFPs from the sectoral
distortions. Using both the input shares and the consumption shares within the CES production
and CES consumption structure we derive simple closed-form sufficient statistics for the sectoral
distortions and for the sectoral TFPs. We then derive a closed-form solution of the elasticities of
each entry in the world input-output matrix to distortions. We compute a total of more than half a
million internal distortions and TFPs and document significant heterogeneity of those across
countries and sectors. We then calculate the whole matrix of about two million elasticities to
distortions and TFPs of the input-output matrix of the world economy. We show that internal
(within a given country) distortions significantly affect the structure of the economy of that
country and have sizeable cross effects on the input-output matrix of other countries. We then
find that the world GDP elasticity to changes in internal distortions is an order of magnitude
larger than that of the external distortions.

Introduction

Wassily Leontief in his Nobel Lecture (Leontief 1974) argued: The world economy, like the
economy of a single country, can be visualized as a system of interdependent processes. In
this paper, we develop a model of the world economy as input-output relationships subject
to distortions.
We study the input-output relationships where the base unit is a country-sector pair.
Rather than considering input-output relationships within countries and trade relationships
across countries, we model the world economy as one world input-output matrix. Moreover,
the structure of the economy, that is the world input-output matrix, is endogenous as the
expenditure shares are determined by the sectoral distortions and TFPs and change with
them. Our primary interest is in identifying the distortions or wedges in these relationships,
and determining the eects of changes in the distortions on the world economy.
The paper derives two main analytical results. First, we propose a methodology to decompose distortions from sectoral TFPs. Specically, we derive simple closed-form sucient
statistics for distortions and for sectoral TFPs as the functions of the small set of directly
observable sectoral input expenditure shares and the nal goods consumption shares. Prior
to describing our results, it is useful to outline the diculty that the literature encountered
with regard to separating distortions from TFPs.

Consider the input-output model with

misallocations of Jones (2011, 2013). He argues that There is a fundamental identication
problem:

we see data on observed intermediate goods shares, and we do not know how

to decompose that data into distortions and dierences in technologies.

1

We solve this

identication problem by considering a model with the CES production for intermediate
goods and the CES consumption structure rather than the Cobb-Douglas form considered
in Jones (2011, 2013), Acemoglu, Carvalho, Ozdaglar, Tahbaz-Salehi (2012), and Caliendo
and Parro (2015). This CES structure is precisely what denes an endogenous input-output
structure of the economy that allows us to identify the distortions and the TFPs separately.
Intuitively, the endogenous input expenditure and consumption shares are aected by the
distortions and TFPs dierently, and we can use these dierent eects to separately identify
distortions and TFPs.

The use of both the production and the consumption side of the

economy and the CES structure are important. If only the production side is used, under
the CES production, the ratio of the net (of distortion) prices needs to be observed to sepa-

Jones (2011, 2013) identify distortions as Hsieh and Klenow (2009) by relating to the undistorted
country, the United States. This, as he acknowledges, assumes that the U.S. same input-output structure
applies to other countries. Tombe and Zhu (2015) identify and evaluate importance of both internal and
external distortions in a model without the input-output structure. Bigio and La'O (2016) study labor and
eciency wedges in an input-output framework and exploit the constancy of the technological parameters
over the business cycle to identify distortions.

rate the sectoral TFPs and the distortions. The consumption side under the CES gives the
ratio of the prices in terms of the consumption shares and hence allows us to identify the
distortions and TFPs separately even if net prices are not observable.

The intuition also

highlights the generality of the method  we can identify as many objects of interest as there
are endogenous shares. In our case, the input and the consumption shares are endogenous,
hence, we can identify both the country-sector TFPs and the distortions.

2

Our second theoretical result is to analytically derive the elasticity of the changes in the
input-output shares to the changes in the distortions and TFPs in terms of the functions
of the small set of directly observable sectoral input expenditure shares. That is, we nd
an elasticity of the shares of inputs of intermediate goods of a country-sector pair (say, the
Basic Metals and Fabricated Metal sector in China) to the change in the distortions or
TFPs in another country-sector pair (say, the distortions in the Financial Intermediation
sector in the United States).

In other words, we characterize the change in the entire

world's input-output matrix structure to the change in a given country-sector pair's TFP or
distortions. Importantly, we have that the elasticity of input-output shares are non-zero and
non-constant, and depends on the interconnection of sectors in the input-output structure.
We further discuss how to decompose these elasticities into the direct eects of changes in
the distortions on expenditure shares, and the indirect eects from changes in the prices of
intermediate goods.
We now turn to the empirical results of the paper.

We derive all the data needed

to measure distortions and TFPs and to compute the elasticities from the World InputOutput Database (WIOD) that traces the ow of goods and services across 35 industries,
40 countries, and a constructed rest of the world, over the period 1995-2011. Overall, we
compute more than half a million internal distortions over this period, and about 2 million
elasticities of input-output shares and world's GDP to changes in distortions.
In our model, changes in distortions impact wages and prices in the whole world economy,
and the input-output shares across all sectors and all countries may change as a result. We
rst study how changes in the internal distortions aect the endogenous structure of the
economy of individual countries. For the U.S. and China's input-output tables we compute
how their own input-output structure change with respect to changes in their own internal
distortions. These two countries are chosen as important illustrative examples with dierent
input-output structure but, of course, we could have chosen a set of any other countries.
We show that the quantitative eects follow the analytical results from the closed-form
elasticities.

Consider the reduction in internal distortions of, for example, manufacturing

We also discuss that our methodology applies more broadly if one is interested in identifying the changes
in the distortions and TFPs  the model then can have a number of additional dimensions of heterogeneity.

industries. The share of manufacturing inputs by all sectors increases because of the direct
eects of the lower distortion, the indirect eects on the price of manufacturing, and the
substitution eect of other sectors becoming more expensive. We then compute the eects
on the U.S. input-output structure from changes in internal distortions in China  the crosselasticity of the U.S. economy structure to Chinese distortions.
Our second exercise is to compute the global elasticity of expenditure shares and elasticity of world's real GDP to changes in internal distortions. Specically, we compute the
change in expenditure shares in all countries and sectors in the world from a 10 percent
reduction in internal distortions all over the world. The main conclusion is that changing
all internal distortions at the same time results in an even more dramatic change in the
world's input-output structure, which reinforces our ndings for the individual countries.
Even more starkly, the importance of the internal distortions can by seen by ranking the
top 60 elasticities of the world's GDP to the distortions of a sector in a given country. The
largest such internal elasticity - that of China's construction sector has the same size as the
elasticity of the world's GDP to

all of the external distortions in the United States.

We then compute the elasticity of world's GDP with respect to external distortions. The
principal result here is that the elasticity of internal distortions is an order of magnitude
larger than the elasticity of external distortions. This is connected to our ndings for the
individual countries that the domestic input-output relations tend to be more important
than cross-country input-output relations. The closest in terms of the result on the internal
versus external distortions is the work by Tombe and Zhu (2015). They show that for China,
the internal distortions play a much larger role for aggregate productivity and output.
Next, we compute the distortions and the TFPs for all of the country-sectors in the
world economy for the period 1995-2011. Our principal nding is that there is a signicant
heterogeneity in the growth rate of the distortions and their distribution across countries.
Therefore, aggregate measures of relative distortions across countries can give only a partial
view of the degree of distortions across countries, since the country level distortions mask
the high heterogeneity at the more disaggregate level.
We conclude with the computation of the change in global input-output shares and
world's real GDP to the actual changes in domestic distortions over the period 1995-2011.
In other words, we show how the world's input-output structure in 2011 would have changed
if internal distortions were set to their 1995 level.

As we have emphasized above, the

world input-output structure shows complex interconnections across sectors and countries,
and these interconnections respond endogenously to changes in distortions.

We observe

signicant changes in the domestic input-output relationships, that is, those would have
been more important today if distortions would have stayed at the level of 1995. We also

4

see quite heterogeneous eects across countries, reinforcing our view on the importance of
seeing the world as a single input-output structure with complex interrelations. Notably,
we highlight more clearly how China would have been less connected to the rest of the
world as a supplier and seller.

3

Consistent with the heterogeneity in the growth rate of

internal distortions, we nd a dierential impact on world's GDP to the actual change in
local distortions across sectors and countries.
We now briey discuss the connection to the literature.

The closest in spirit to our

paper is the macroeconomic literature that emphasizes domestic distortions (misallocation)
across sectors and rms (e.g.
Hsieh and Klenow (2009).

4

Jones 2010, 2011) , Restuccia and Rogerson (2008, 2013),

Our paper also relates to recent studies that show how local

productivity shocks or distortions spread within a country (see e.g. Caliendo, Parro, and
Rossi-Hansberg 2014, Fajgelbaum, Morales, Serrato, and Zidar 2015) and to the literature
on aggregate consequences of idiosyncratic shocks that emphasizes the departure from the
Cobb-Douglas assumptions (Atalay 2017, Baqaee and Farhi 2017, and Carvalho, Nirei, Saito,
and Tahbaz-Salehi 2017).
The paper is organized as follows.

In Section 2 we present our model of the input-

output structure of the world economy. In Section 3 we derive our main theoretical results;
the sucient statistics to identify distortions and TFPs, and the sucient statistic for the
changes in the input-output structure to changes in the internal distortions.

Section 4

describes the data and calibration strategy, and Section 5 presents the input-output share
elasticities, and world's GDP elasticities to changes in distortions, as well as the computed
actual changes in distortions and their impact on the world's input-output structure. Finally,
Section 6 concludes.

we account for the heterogeneity in the value added shares across sectors and countries observed in the data.

This assumption is also not essential as, for example, heterogenous markups represent themselves as
the sector level distortions.

We also assume that there is no distortion when a sector sources materials from itself,

τijij = 1.
We call the distortions that aect sectors within a country,

τijik , internal distortions.

Examples of such distortions are sector-specic taxes, subsidies, or markups. We call the
distortions that aect sectors across countries,

τijnk (i 6= n), external distortions.

Examples

of such distortions are trade costs, implicit subsidies or taris for imports or exports, or
dierences in contract enforcement.

Theoretical Results

3.1 Sucient Statistics for Identication of Distortions and TFPs
In this section we propose a method to separately decompose the TFPs and the distortions in
the input-output economy  this is the rst main theoretical result of the paper. The key to
the results is threefold. First, the CES structure of production of both the intermediate goods
and consumption yields the expenditure shares

γ

and consumption shares

α

varying with

TFP and distortions. Second, TFP and distortions aect the production and consumption
shares dierently, hence allowing to separately identify these two objects. Third, using the

7

consumption shares allows us to substitute for prices with the consumption shares

α,

and

hence is applicable when the prices are not observable.
First, consider the internal distortions and the sectoral TFP for country i. We start with
the production side of the economy. The share of the input of the sector

is:

to separate distortions from TFPs, we now turn to the consumption side of the economy.

Hence, the distortion is the wedge in the rst order condition whereas the undistorted
economy equates the relative consumption shares to the input shares.

The analysis of

the external distortions is identical with the exception that the nal expression would also
include the ratio of the wages in countries

i

and

n.

We summarize the results in the rst main proposition of the paper:

Proposition 1.

In a world with

N countries (indexed by i, n) and J sectors (indexed by

j, k ) the internal distortions are given by:

.

The proposition above gives a very simple closed-form expression for the sucient statistics formula to identify external and internal distortions separately from the TFPs. All of
the formulas are expressed in terms of the small set of directly observable empirical coun-

9

terparts from the world input-output table. Note that the TFPs are calculated up to one
reference sector for a country.
We now discuss the generality and the limitations of the proposition. The key to the
analysis is that we use both the consumption and the production shares to separately identify
distortions and the TFPs. The generality of the result can be summarized as follows: we
can identify as many elements of the model (i.e., distortions and TFPs) as there are CES
shares of consumption and production. Otherwise, only the composite distortion

τ̃

can be

identied.
However, if the additional parameters are not changing with time, one can also identify
changes in distortions and TFPs from the changes in the shares of consumption and production. Consider, for example, the case of the consumption preferences diering by country,
or the inputs weights in the production of material being asymmetric:


U (Ci ) = 

 1+θ

Mij = 

.

n,k
The formulas for distortions in Proposition 1 would then feature the ratios of the consumption

χij ,

and the input weights

parameters

χij

ιijnk .

At the same time, assuming that the preference

and production parameters

ιijnk

are not changing over time, they would

immediately drop out if we consider the change of the distortion across time.

The same

principle applies to other modications of the model such as, for example, adding consumption distortions. If these additional elements do not change over time, one can still identify
the changes in the distortions. Consequently, in the quantitative analysis in Section 5 we
compute growth rates in distortions and TFPs, and the elasticities of input-output shares
and world's GDP to changes in distortions; and therefore, these extensions to our model do
not aect our quantitative results.
We comment on the two key dierence with the results of the macroeconomic literature
that focuses on misallocations and distortions  the use of the CES production function,
and the use of the CES consumption to derive the ratio of the prices. In Hsieh and Klenow
(2009), the production function is Cobb-Douglas. They identify the distortions by making
reference to the undistorted country. This amounts in our context to assuming that either
the net (of distortion) as well as gross (with distortion) prices are observable or that the
country/sector pairs have the same Cobb-Douglas elasticities of inputs. Jones (2011, 2013),

10

which are the closest to our study, also use the Cobb-Douglas production in the input-output
structure and hence cannot separate the TFPs from the distortions. Besides, Cobb-Douglas
assumption implies that the expenditure and the consumption shares are exogenous and do

8

not change with distortions and TFPs.

Notice that to compute internal distortions, external distortions, or TFPs, we do not need
to solve for the general equilibrium of the model, as they can be directly computed using
data on intermediate and nal expenditure shares, conditional on values for the elasticities

σ

and

θ.

As discussed above, we do not need to use price data or impose symmetry in

distortions either, dierent from common approaches followed in the trade literature to
compute external distortions.

9 It is also immediately clear how to extend the analysis to

the cases of the commonly used trade models. In particular, a wide class of trade models
(e.g. Anderson and van Wincoop 2003, Eaton and Kortum 2002, Melitz 2003, among many
others) deliver a gravity equation of type of equation (1), but for the case of cross-country
ows in a given sector (that is, when

i 6= n

and

k = j ).

It immediately follows that our

sucient statistic can be directly mapped to gravity-trade models to infer trade costs.

3.2 Sucient Statistics for the Changes in the Input-Output Structure
The second set of the theoretical results that we derive is how changes in sectoral TFPs or
distortions aect the input-output structure of the economy. The main feature of our model
is that the input-output matrix is endogenous.

That is, following the change in sectoral

TFPs or distortions, the expenditure shares (or input-output shares) change as well.

In

this section, we analytically derive the elasticities of the input-output shares with respect
to changes in the sectoral TFPs or internal distortions.
We rst derive an intermediate result that expresses the changes in the expenditure
shares in terms of the higher-level policy elasticities.

That is, the policy elasticities are

derived in terms of the endogenous prices rather than in terms of the primitives. If the prices

Both CES and Cobb-Douglas are subject to a similar limitation, that one cannot account for the
formation of new input-output relations, that is, input-output shares that change from zero to positive.
However, at the level of aggregation that we work in the empirical section, these cases are negligible.
9
Note that if sectoral prices were observable equation (2) could be used to identify the distortions. In
practice, sectoral prices across countries can be found in some existing databases such as the International
Comparison Program (ICP), or can be inferred using sectoral deators from other databases such as EUKLEM or the GGDC 10-Sector Database. However, there are two major issues with this approach. First,
using price data from these or other sources is always going to constraint the computation of internal
distortions due to the lack of consistent time series data or the lack of price data for non-tradable industries,
the reduced number of countries in the database, the reduced number of sectors, or due to inconsistencies
between the denition of prices in the price databases (for instance, deators or PPI indexes), and their
counterpart in the model or in the input-output data. Second, and perhaps more importantly, the measured
prices do not take into account implicit price distortions such as dierences in contract enforcement or
implicit subsidies.
8

11

are observable, these elasticities are easily estimated. This proposition allows us to clearly
identify the major forces aecting the endogenous change in the input-output structure of
the economy to the change in the distortions.

According this proposition, the elasticity of the expenditure share

to changes in

distortions depends on four forces. First, there is a direct eect of a reduction in

increases. Second, a reduction in distortions in sector

j , either

or any other origin sector-country, will reduce the price index in the

A reduction in distortions of selling goods from country

and on the elasticity of

the wage elasticity to changes in distortions.
We now turn to derive a closed-form expression for the input-output share elasticity

dlogγijnk

with respect to distortions or TFPs. In Appendix 1, we derive the elasticity of the

whole world's input-output structure with respect to changes in distortions and productivities in terms of the primitives of the model up to the change in the wages. Specically, the
change in the world's input-output structure to changes in distortions and productivities is
given by the following equation:

Γ = F(θ, β, γlsmh )A + H(θ, β, γlsmh )τ + O(θ, β, γlsmh )ω,
where

Γ, A, τ ,

and

ω

are vectors that contain the log changes in expenditure shares,

These matrices provide the

direct eects of distortions and productivities on the input-output shares as well as the
indirect eects through changes in prices.
To reduce the notational burden, we derive below this elasticity under some simplifying
assumptions. Specically, we assume one country

i,

and two sectors

j, k.

We normalize the

wage in that country to 1, and study the elasticity of the input-output share
change in the distortion

γijik

to a

τijik . Totally dierentiating the expression for the prices and for the

input-output shares, we obtain the following proposition.

Proposition 3.

Consider sectors

j and k of a country i. Let

γ̃isip ≡
for

γisip
,
1 − γisip (1 − β)

s, p ∈ {j, k}.
The elasticities of the input-output shares with respect to distortions are given by:

d log γijik

= −θ
,
d log τijik
1 − γ̃ikij (1 − β) γ̃ijik (1 − β)
d log γikij
γ̃ijik (1 − β) (1 − γ̃ikij )
= −θ
.
d log τijik
1 − γ̃ikij (1 − β) γ̃ijik (1 − β)
The elasticities of the input-output shares with respect to sectoral TFPs are given by:

d log γijik
1
=θ
[γ̃ikij γ̃ikik (1 − β) − γ̃ijij ] ,
dAij

=θ 1−
(− (1 − β) γ̃ijij + γ̃ikij γ̃ikik (1 − β)) .
d log Aij
1 − γ̃ikij (1 − β) γ̃ijik (1 − β)

This proposition provides the closed-form solution for elasticities in terms of easily observable empirical variables. We now briey illustrate the intuition for this result on an even
simpler case. Suppose that
sector

j.

γikij = 0,

that is, sector

k

does not purchase any inputs from

also takes a

very simple form, depending only on the relevant sector's share:

d log Pij
d log Pij
= −γ̃ijij .,
= γ̃ijik ;
d log τijik
d log Aij
This further leads to very simple expressions for the elasticities of the shares:

d log γijik
d log γikij
= −θ (1 − γ̃ijik ) ;
= −θ (1 − β) γ̃ijik ,
d log τijik
d log τijik
and

d log γikij

d log Aij is decreasing in γikik .

γijik ;

This implies that

d log γijik
that
d log Aij

and

With this set of theoretical results, we proceed in the next section to compute the
world's input-output elasticities to changes in distortions, to identify the actual growth rate
in distortions over time, and to study the impact of these actual changes in distortions on
the world's input-output structure. We start next section by describing the data needed for
our quantitative exercises.

4

Data and Calibration

All the data needed to measure distortions and TFPs, and to compute the empirical exercises
in the next section come from the World Input-Output Database (WIOD). The WIOD
database traces the ow of goods and services across 35 industries classied according to
the NACE classication system, 40 countries, and a constructed rest of the world, over
the period 1995-2011. This data is integrated into a world input-output table, which also
provides gross output and value added for each sector and country.

In Appendix 2 we

provide the exact list of the sectors and the countries.
The ow of goods and services includes domestic transactions of intermediate goods,
that is, ows across industries in a given country, as well as cross-sector and cross-country
ows. Using these ows, we are able to directly determine the bilateral expenditure shares

γijnk

across all countries and sectors. The WIOD database also contains nal expenditure

across sectors and countries that we use to construct

αij .

In doing so, we leave out changes

in inventories from the calculations. The shares of value added across sectors and countries,

βij ,

are constructed using value added and gross output data for each sector and country.

Finally, we use the standard values of the elasticities in the literature

14

θ=σ=4

.

Figure 1 displays the heatmap of the world input-output table for the year 2011. Specifically, it shows the bilateral expenditure shares across all sectors an countries in the world,
where the y-axis (rows) presents the buyer unit, and the x-axis (columns) shows the seller
unit. The colors in the gure represents dierent percentiles that are labeled on the right
hand side of the gure, and the observations are ordered rst by country and then by sector.
For instance, the 80th percentile corresponds to an expenditure share of 0.0049, that is, the
buyer unit is spending 0.0049 percent of its total expenditure on goods from that specic
seller unit. Since observations are ordered rst by country and then by sector, the rst red
square visualized in the gure displays the Australian domestic input-output coecients,
that is, expenditure share of each Australian sector on goods from every other industry in
Australia.

We want to highlight two relevant features from the world input-output table.

First,

the diagonal is strong, that is, the red squares along the diagonal of the gures mean that
the domestic input-output transactions tend to be stronger than the cross-country transactions. However, the importance of domestic input-output linkages varies across countries.
For instance, we can see from the gure that in more open economies such as Luxembourg,

15

a greater number domestic input-output shares fall below the 80th percentile than in other
countries, which indicates that domestic transactions are relatively less important in Luxembourg. Second, the world is very interconnected, with countries such as China, the United
States, and Germany playing a role of the important suppliers of inputs for all countries in
the world. Later, we discuss further how these features shape the elasticities of GDP and
expenditure shares with respect to changes in distortions.

In Figure 2, we reproduce the input-output for the U.S. economy presented as a heatmap.
The y-axis (rows) shows the buyer sectors from each seller sector in the x-axis (columns).In
the gure, for a given seller industry, we aggregated U.S. purchases from all countries in
the world in that industry.

Similar to the previous gure, the colors represents dierent

percentiles that are labeled on the right hand side of the gure.

For instance, the 80th

percentile in the gure corresponds to a U.S. sector that spends at least 3.3 percent of their
total expenditure on goods from a given seller, including purchase from the United States,
and from all other countries in the world.
We observe from the gure that the diagonal is strong, that is, a sector tends to buy
more materials from itself rather than other sectors. Still, the interconnection across sectors

16

is also relevant. In particular, some service sectors such as nance and business activities are
an important source of intermediate inputs to other sectors, as well as some manufacturing
sectors such as petroleum and paper. The same features characterize the input-output table
of China displayed in Figure 3.

In the next section, we show the elasticities of these input-output tables in these countries
to changes in internal distortions, as well as the cross-country elasticities where distortions
in other countries change.

Quantitative Analysis

In this section, we discuss the empirical results of the paper.
Before turning to the results, we show how to close the model developed in Section 2,
and describe the equilibrium conditions needed to compute the general equilibrium eects

17

in the model. Specically, we impose the market clearing condition given by:

wi Li =

J X
N
X
1 − βnk

βnk

k=1 n=1

γnkij Xnk .

(5)

The equilibrium of this economy is therefore dened by equations (1), (3), (4), and (5).

5.1 Elasticities and Endogenous IO
In our model, changes in distortions impact wages and prices in the whole world economy,
and the input-output shares across all sectors and all countries may change as a result. Given
this, the world's input-output structure is endogenous to changes in distortions.

In this

section, we emphasize this point by computing the elasticity of the input-output shares to
changes in internal distortions. We rst focus on the U.S. and China input-output structure,
and compute how their input-output structure change with respect to changes in their own
internal distortions. We then compute the eects on the U.S. input-output structure from
changes in internal distortions in China  the cross-elasticity of China's internal distortions
on the United States. In the next section we take a global view on the impact of internal
distortions on the world's input-output structure.
We start by computing how the U.S. input-output structure would change with respect to
a 10 percent decline in internal (within the United States) distortions in the manufacturing
industries. The results are displayed in Figure 4.
The upper two panels show the eects of the decline in the distortions of selling goods
to manufacturing industries from any industry.

The lower two panels show the eects

of the decline in distortions of buying goods from the manufacturing industries by any
industry. We show the change in expenditure shares to changes in internal distortions in
absolute terms on the left panels, and in percent changes on the right panels. We can see
from the gure how the U.S. input-output table is impacted by changes in distortions in
the manufacturing industries.

In particular, we observe that manufacturing sectors buy

more from other manufacturing sectors.

Since it is cheap for manufacturing industries

to buy intermediate inputs from everywhere, they will buy proportionally more from the
manufacturing industries because those industries experience a larger decline in the price
index. In the lower panels, we observe that all sectors, and especially non-manufacturing
industries, substitute inputs from non-manufacturing industries for manufacturing inputs,
as the latter are now a cheaper source of inputs after the decline in distortions.

These

two ndings are in line with the eects from the closed-form elasticities in Proposition 2
discussed in the previous section.

In Figure 5, we perform the same exercise but for a dierent economy, China, as a way
of conrming whether the ndings for the U.S. hold for another economy with a dierent
input-output structure. The four panels in Figure 5 follow the same structure as in Figure 4.
In a nutshell, we can see qualitatively similar eects of the changes in internal distortions in
China on the Chinese input-output structure. The upper panels show that manufacturing
industries tend to buy more from manufacturing sectors, and the lower panels show that

19

manufacturing industries increase their importance as suppliers for the rest of the economy.

These ndings conrm a common pattern across countries, in line with the predictions of
our closed-form elasticities. However, we emphasize the fact that the input-output structure
of the U.S. economy is dierent from the Chinese one, and therefore the eects of the
changes in distortions at the more disaggregate level are dierent in these two economies.
For instance, the share of manufacturing purchases in total expenditure increases by 9.3

20

percent in absolute terms in the United States, and 12.3 percent in China. The sectors that
increase more the purchases of manufacturing in the United States are Leather and Textiles,
while in China the sectors that experience the largest increase in manufacturing purchases
are transportation equipment and metals. Overall, these exercises show how our model and
the derived elasticities emphasize these heterogenous input-output eects from changes in
distortions across countries.

The nal exercise we perform in this section aims at computing the cross-country eects
of changes in internal distortions in the manufacturing sectors. Specically, we compute the
change in the U.S. input-output shares from a 10 percent reduction in the internal distortions
in China. Figure 6 shows the results.
Similar to the previous gures 4 and 5, the upper panels show the eects of changes in
manufacturing distortions as buyers of goods from any industries, and the lower panels show
the change in internal distortions from selling to the manufacturing industries. As in the
previous gures, the left panels show absolute changes in expenditure shares and the right
panels show percent changes in expenditure shares.
Turning to the results, Figure 6 shows two relevant facts.

First, the U.S. economy

purchases proportionally more inputs from the manufacturing industries, and also manufacturing industries increase their importance as suppliers for the rest of the U.S. economy.
This highlight the fact that the Chinese manufacturing is more connected to the U.S. manufacturing sectors than to other industries. Second, there are also some relevant eects in
U.S. non manufacturing industries such as transport services, health, and education, which
increase their importance as suppliers.
These two results in addition to the previous ones highlight how complex the inputoutput relationships within countries and across countries are, and given this, how important
is to keep track of the endogenous changes in them as a results of changes in distortions
anywhere in the world.

5.2 World Elasticities
In this section, we take a global perspective of the input-output shares and compute the
global elasticity of expenditure shares and elasticity of world's real GDP to changes in
internal distortions. We also compute the elasticity of world's GDP with respect to external
distortions, and discuss the relative importance of the internal versus external distortions.
In Figure 7, we start with a similar computation to the one performed in the previous
section, but taking a view at the whole world's input-output structure. To do so, we compute
the change in expenditure shares in all countries and sectors in the world from a 10 percent
reduction in internal distortions all over the world. The main conclusion we get from the
gure is that changing internal distortions at the same time has dramatic change in the
world's input-output structure, which reinforces our ndings in the previous section. From
the gure we can see that changes in domestic input-output transactions are important, but
we also see signicant changes in the whole world's input-output structure.

In Figure 8, we compute the world's real GDP elasticities with respect to changes in
internal distortions in each country. Specically, each unit in the gure shows the percent
change in world's real GDP from a one percent reduction in distortions in a given industry
and country of buying goods from all industries in that country.

23

The change in world's

real GDP is computed by aggregating the changes in real wages across all countries using
each country's GDP as weights. As in the previous gures, each color represents a given
percentile. For instance, the blue cells correspond to the country-sectors whose changes in
internal distortions would have a larger impact in the aggregate world's economy. This is
the case of most of the sectors in United States and China, as well as some important sectors
such as real estate, nance, business activities, and public administration in some developed
countries such as Germany, France, Italy, and Japan. Overall, the elasticity of world's real
GDP is aected by both the size of the industry and how interconnected is a given industry
in a given country with the rest of the economy, and with the rest of the world, and as a
result, the bottom line of this exercise is to shed light on how quantitatively signicant the
impact on the world's economy as a whole would be to changes in internal distortions in
specic sectors and countries.

Even more starkly, the importance of the internal distortions can be seen in Figure 9.
Here, we rank top 60 elasticities of the world's GDP to a sector in a given country. The
largest such internal elasticity - that of China's construction sector (0.0436) has the same
size as the elasticity of the world's GDP to all of the external distortions in the United
States. More broadly, this graph shows importance of the distortions of individual sectors
on the world economy.

Figure 10: World's real GDP elasticity to internal versus external distortions

(b) External distortions

In Figure 10, we compute the world's real GDP elasticity to changes in internal distortions in a given country in Panel (a), and we then compare them with the world's real GDP
elasticity to changes in external distortions.

From Panel (a), we can see that the largest

elasticity is that of China at 0.41, followed by the United States (0.33), Japan (0.15), and
Germany (0.08).

Panel (b) presents the calculations for the elasticity of world's GDP to

external distortions. The largest elasticity is that of the United States at 0.042, followed by
China (0.038 percent), Germany (0.025 percent), and Japan (0.017 percent).
Comparing the elasticities with respect to internal versus external distortions, three facts
arise. First, note that while the ranking of the elasticities by countries are similar, they are
not identical.

Second, and more importantly, the elasticity with respect to the internal

distortions is an order magnitude larger than that of external distortions.

10

Third, for

In Appendix 3, we also present the normalized elasticity  the elasticity divided by the size of the
country's GDP. The ranking diers but the main insight of the much larger quantitative signicance of the
10

25

some countries such as Luxembourg, the elasticity to external distortions is larger than the
elasticity to internal distortions. The general nding that the elasticity of internal distortions
is larger than the elasticity of external distortions can be connected to our ndings in the
previous section that domestic input-output relations tend to be more important that crosscountry input-output relations. This dierent magnitude between internal versus external
elasticities also sheds lights on the potential impact of changes in domestic versus external
policy-related distortions.

5.3 Distortions and TFP
In this section we use the sucient statistics derived in Section 3 to compute the evolution of
internal distortions and TFPs for the period of study. Our principal nding is a signicant
heterogeneity in the growth rate of the distortions and their distribution across countries.
We conclude with the computation of the change in global input-output shares and world's
real GDP elasticity to the actual changes in domestic distortions over the period 1995-2011.

5.3.1 Internal Distortions
Turning to the analysis of the internal distortions, Figure 11 shows the distribution of the
annual rate of growth of internal distortions for the world, and for selected countries. This
is an important graph as it shows several notable features. First, there is large heterogeneity
in terms of the growth rate of distortions across sectors. For each country there are sectors
in which the distortions grew and in which distortions decreased. Second, the heterogeneity diers across countries. The United States and Japan have relatively small dispersion
compared to Europe, and all of these countries have much smaller dispersion compared to
China.
The main bottom line of these histograms is that, to a greater or lesser extent, there
is heterogeneity in the changes in internal distortions in all countries, and some sectors
have become more distorted and other less distorted in some countries relative to others.
Therefore, aggregate measures of relative distortions across countries can give only a partial
view of the degree of distortions across countries, since they hide this high heterogeneity at
the more disaggregate level.

internal elasticities remains.

5.3.2 TFP
We now turn to our TFP calculations.

As it was clear in Section 4, with our sucient

statistics we can compute TFPs relative to a reference sector in each country. Therefore,
in all calculations below we present our TFP calculations relative to the agriculture sector.
We start by describing the change in sectoral TFP in the world over the period 1995-2011.

The upper panel in Figure 12 shows the evolution of the TFP in the manufacturing sector
and the service sector, using gross output weights to aggregate TFP across industries and
countries. The lower panels show the annual growth in TFP in the world across dierent
manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors.

A clear fact from the gure is the higher

growth rate in the service sectors than in the manufacturing sectors. Among service sectors,
we nd that telecommunications, education, and water transport experienced the highest
growth rate in TFP in the world, while retail sales slightly contracted. In the manufacturing
industries, petroleum, plastics, and metals are the sectors with the highest growth rate.
As a way of validating our TFP measure, in Figure 13 we compare our constructed TFP
series for the United States, where we recover the aggregate TFP by using TFP estimates
from the agricultural sector from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and from EU_Klems,
with the BLS multi-factor productivity.

We see that our model-implied aggregate TFP

series is in line with that from the BLS, although it is somehow more volatile. Overall, the
correlation between both is very high. We also computed the annual growth in TFP across
countries, and nd, similar to the changes in internal distortions, signicant heterogeneity
across sectors and across countries.

5.3.3 Eects of Actual Changes in Internal Distortions
In this section, we combine the elasticities of the input-output shares and world's GDP with
respect to changes in internal distortions, and our computed internal distortions using the
sucient statistics derived in Section 4. We then compute the change in the input-output
shares across all sectors and countries in the world and the world's GDP elasticities to the
actual changes in distortions over the period 1995-2011.

29

We start with Figure 14 that shows the change (absolute and percent) in global expenditure shares with respect to the actual changes in internal distortions. In other words, the
gure shows how the world's input-output structure would have changed if internal distortions were back to their 1995 level. As we have emphasized above, the world input-output
structure shows complex interconnections across sectors and countries, and these interconnections respond endogenously to changes in distortions. As a result, we see how the actual
changes in distortions have changed the world's input-output structure near all over the
units. We can see more signicant changes in the domestic input-output relationships, that
is, the stronger diagonal of the matrix means that domestic input-output relationships would
have been more important today if distortions would have stayed at the level of 1995. We
also see quite heterogeneous eects across countries, reinforcing our view on the importance
of seeing the world as a single input-output structure with complex interrelations. Notably,
the right panel highlights more clearly how China would have been less connected to the
rest of the world as a supplier and seller.

The very large percentage changes at the top percentile on the right panel correspond in general to
cases with a very small (close to zero) initial input-output share that experienced signicant changes in
distortions over 1995-2011. Examples of these outliers are purchases from the metal sector by a number of
manufacturing industries in Malta, purchases from textiles by the nance and transport service industries
in Cyprus, and purchases from mining by construction in India.

Finally, Figure 15 displays the change in world's GDP with respect to the actual changes
in internal distortions. We compute the change in world's GDP by aggregating the change in
real wages across countries using each country's GDP as weights. The gure shows that the
growth rate in world's GDP to a change in local distortion has been very heterogeneous across
dierent sectors and countries in the world. This nding is consistent with the heterogeneity
in the growth rate in internal distortions discussed in Section 5.3.1, and also with the fact
that some sectors have become more distorted and other less distorted in some countries
relative to others.

For instance, lower distortions in China in sectors such as education,

health, construction, and electrical equipment contributed to a positive global GDP growth,
while sectors such as plastics and metals had a negative impact on world's GDP.

Conclusion

Our paper achieves several goals.

First, we argue that it is fruitful to study the world

economy as one interconnected input-output table with the country-sector pair as the base
unit of analysis.

Second, we show that the endogeneity of the input-output table due to

the CES structure of production and consumption is important. This endogeneity allows
us to resolve an important issue in the analysis of economies with distortions, namely,
how to analytically and empirically separately identify distortions and TFPs in the cases
when the input-output relationships may dier across countries. Our nding of signicant
heterogeneity in distortions within and across countries implies that the analysis of the

31

aggregate distortions at the country level may be masking the eects of the the disaggregated
distortions. Even more importantly, we show how to analytically compute the elasticities of
distortions in a given country on the endogenous structure of the input-output relationships
in that country, on other countries, and on the world's economy.

We nd that internal

distortions play an important role in determining the structure of the economies of the
individual countries and of the world economy. The elasticities of the internal distortions
are an order of magnitude larger than those of the external distortions. Finally, we show how
the world economy changed due to the evolution of the internal distortions in 1995-2011.
We see how the world became more interconnected and how China's rise aected the world
economy. After all, the world economy, like the economy of a single country, can be thought
of as a system of interdependent processes.
