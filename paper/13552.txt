China's Exports and Employment

NBER Working Paper No. 13552

JEL No. F1,O1,R15
ABSTRACT
Dooley et al (2003, 2004a,b,c) argue that China seeks to raise urban employment by 10-12 million
persons per year, with about 30% of that coming from export growth. In fact, total employment increased
by 7.5-8 million per year over 1997-2005. We estimate that export growth over 1997-2002 contributed
at most 2.5 million jobs per year, with most of the employment gains coming from non-traded goods
like construction. Exports grew much faster over the 2000-2005 period, which could in principal explain
the entire increase in employment. However, the growth in domestic demand led to three-times more
employment gains than did exports over 2000-2005, while productivity growth subtracted the same
amount again from employment. We conclude that exports have become increasingly important in
stimulating employment in China, but that the same gains could be obtained from growth in domestic
demand, especially for tradable goods, which has been stagnant until at least 2002.

1. Introduction
In a series of four papers, Dooley et al (2003, 2004a,b,c) lay out a vision of a “revived
Bretton Woods system” to explain international trade and monetary arrangements today.
According to their vision, this system has the following elements:
1) Under the old Bretton Woods system, European countries adopted undervalued
exchange rates and capital controls, allowing then to pursue export-led growth. They eventually
graduated to flexible exchange rate and capital mobility, thereby jointly forming a “capital
account” region (along with Canada and Latin America);
2) Another group of countries including Asia and especially China make up the new
periphery, again adopted undervalued exchange rates and capital controls to pursue export-led
growth. These countries form a “trade account” region. China, in particular, needs to employ
some 200 million persons from the rural area, or 10-12 million persons per year in the urban
areas, which is facilitated by the inflow of foreign direct investment;
3) The United States is at the center, and its budget and current account deficits have their
counterpart in the trade surpluses in Asia. The U.S. current account deficit is financed through
official inflows from the “trade account” region and private inflows from the “capital account”
region;
4) The system is sustainable so long as the “trade account” region continues to finance
the U.S. trade deficit and protectionism does not occur. Threats of protectionism are offset by the
profits earned by foreign investors in the “trade account” region, especially China. Conversely,
the trade deficits run by the U.S. (or equivalently, the Treasury bills held by China) are a form of
collateral that prevents the Chinese from seizing the assets of foreign firms, which would lead
U.S. to default on its financial obligations.

2
Some of these various hypotheses are more controversial than others. For example, Wei
(undated) objects to the idea that U.S. Treasury bills held by China act as collateral against the
Chinese seizing foreign plants, arguing that: (i) most FDI in China does not come from the U.S.,
but rather from Hong Kong; (ii) there is no recent history of China seizing control of foreign
firms; (iii) there is even less history of the United States defaulting on its Treasury bill
obligations. But this final idea of U.S. Treasury bill acting as collateral is not really essential for
the rest of the theory,1 and controversy over it need not detract from the other hypotheses. The
focus of this paper is on the least controversial of their hypotheses, and that is the idea that
expanding exports from China serve to create employment in the urban areas.
Our goal is to quantitatively evaluate this employment hypothesis, i.e. to answer the
question of how much employment is created by rising Chinese exports. Even this hypothesis is
not as straightforward as it might seem. A recent article in the Economist entitled “The Jobless
Boom,” notes that employment growth has been lower than overall economic growth across
various countries of Asia, especially in China, and that this ratio has been falling over time.2
Citing a study by the Asian Development Bank (Felipe and Hasan, 2006a,b), the article suggests
that the reasons for this weak employment growth has been the shift towards more productive,
capital-intensive industries. Dooley et al (2004b, p. 4) themselves do not expect the employment
growth to come entirely from exports, and in fact, suggest that employment growth of 3 million
workers per year in China will come from rising exports.
A logical starting point to determine the employment effect of exports is to look at the
calculations from input-output (IO) tables for China, with both the direct and indirect demand for

1

In fact, Dooley et al (2004c) motivate the collateral idea by noting that the rest of their theory does not necessarily
imply a trade deficit in the United States as center country; by adding the trade deficits as collateral, that limitation
of the theory is overcome.

labor from ordinary and processing exports. As reviewed in section 2, an increase in ordinary
exports of $1,000 (the annual wage in manufacturing in 2000) leads to employment of 0.44
person-years in 2000, and 0.34 person-years in 2002, with much smaller effects from processing
exports. But surprisingly, applying these “static employment coefficients” to compute the
implied employment gains due to the growth in domestic demand and exports, over 1997–2002
and 2000–2005, leads to employment gains that vastly exceed the actual employment increase in
China. In other words, the static employment coefficients are an unreliable guide to computing
the actual employment effects of export growth.
One reason why the static employment effects are unreliable has already been suggested:
changes in the industry composition of exports towards more productive industries. This source
of aggregate productivity growth is sometimes called the “Denison effect” in the U.S. literature
(Nordhaus, 1992, p. 215), as discussed in section 3. Shifting towards more productive industries
means that the labor needed to produce any given output is reduced. We show in section 4 that
accounting for the “Denison effect” reduces the employment impact of exports by about 25%
from the initial calculations, but we still predict employment gains due to rising exports that are
much too high.
Besides the shifting composition of industries, aggregate productivity can rise due to
technological progress and capital accumulation. We do not attempt to fully account for this
second source of productivity growth, but make a limited attempt by using the growth in wages
over time: in our calculations with the IO tables, rising wages means reduced employment
growth. We show in section 5 that this factor further reduces the employment gains that we can
expect from exports, to 45% of the initial calculation for ordinary exports and 75% of the initial
calculation for processing exports. These are rules of thumb that can be used to reduce the static

4
employment coefficients for exports.
In section 6 we investigate the growth in domestic demand in China over 1997–2002,
when our data is most complete. Looking first at traded goods (agriculture, mining and
manufacturing), and accounting for the “Denison effect,” we find that the net employment
growth in those sectors due to rising domestic demand is actually negative. That is, the shift
towards more productive industries has outstripped the increase in final demand, leading to no
net job creation. The only source of employment gains during 1997–2002 was in the non-traded
sectors, such as construction, and final consumer services like restaurants, health services,
education, etc. Taking into account the same factors as for exports, i.e. shifting demand across
industries and rising wages, we find that the impact of domestic demand on employment is 75%
smaller than the initial calculation from the IO table, which gives us another rule of thumb.
Using these rules of thumb we revise the static employment coefficients, and in section 7
re-calculate the impact of rising exports and domestic demand on labor demand in China. We
find the implied employment growth from exports is modest over the 1997–2002 period: not
more than 2.5 million jobs added per year. During the 2000–2005 period exports grew much
faster, so the employment impact is also higher: exports added as much as 7.5 million jobs per
year. However, domestic demand led to three-times more employment gains than did exports,
while productivity growth subtracted the same amount again from employment. This calculation
confirms the suggestion in Dooley et al (2004b, note 5) that about 30% of the employment
growth in China will come from rising exports. We conclude in section 8 that exports have
become increasingly important in stimulating employment in China, but that the same gains
could be obtained from growth in domestic demand, especially for tradable goods, which has
been stagnant until at least 2002, and possibly beyond (Aziz and Cui, 2007).

5
2. Employment Gains in China
We begin by reviewing the recent growth in employment, GDP and exports in China.
Throughout the paper we focus on the period 1997–2005, which gives us two overlapping fiveyear intervals to work with: 1997–2002 and 2000–2005. Despite the relatively short span of
years and closeness of these two intervals, we will find substantial changes in the Chinese
economy over this time.
In Table 1 we list total employment, broken down by urban and rural, as well as GDP and
its components during these years. Total employment has grown by 7.5–8 million workers per
year over this period, while urban employment has grown slightly faster: 8–8.5 million workers,
as there was some migration out of the countryside. Real GDP and its components, as well as all
trade data, is measured in constant 2000 US$.3 Real GDP growth doubled from 5.7% per year
over 1997–2002 to 11.0% in 2000–2005.4 Notice that the growth of C+G is much less in the
2000–2005 period than is the growth in investment, indicating that an increasing share of
domestic demand is for construction projects and other investments.
In Table 2 we provide the data on Chinese ordinary and processing trade, again in
constant 2000 US$. Both exports and imports grew by more than 20% per year over the 2000–
2005 period, which greatly outstripped their prior growth: the boom in Chinese trade is really a
feature of the 21st century. Note that the trade balance listed in the final column of Table 2 does
not match the values for (X–M) given in the final column of Table 1, because (X–M) includes
both goods and services as used in GDP accounts, whereas the trade balance in Table 2 is just for

3

We lack specific deflators for components of GDP and trade, and the overall Chinese inflation rate is erratic over
this period, including some years of deflation. Since our trade data is reported in US$, we decide to use constant
2000 US$ to measure all other values, converted with the nominal yuan/dollar rate and using the U.S. CPI.
4
The real GDP figures we are using are deflated by the U.S. CPI, as explained in note 3, and are based on
expenditure GDP rather than production GDP. For these reasons, the growth rates differ from those sometimes
reported in the press.

6
merchandise trade.
A logical starting point to determine the impacts of export growth on employment are the
studies by Lau et al (2004), using a 1995 IO table for China, and Lau et al (2006a,b), using a
2002 IO table. From the 1995 table, Lau et al (2004) estimate that $1,000 of ordinary exports
from China leads to 0.70 person-years of employment, and $1,000 of processing exports leads to
0.06 person-years, or roughly one-tenth as much as for ordinary exports. Those estimates are
shown in Table 3, and have been falling over time. Using the 2002 IO table, Lau et al (2006a,b)
estimate that $1,000 of ordinary exports from China leads to 0.36 person-years of employment
(which is one-half as much as they found for 1995), and $1,000 of processing exports leads to
0.11 person-years (which is twice the estimate for 1995), so processing exports lead to about
three-tenths the employment of ordinary exports.
We will refer to these employment estimates computed from the IO tables as “static
employment coefficients,” because they each refer to a single year. The change in these static
employment coefficients can be due to either of the factors we identified in the introduction:
shifting composition of exports across industries and technological progress. We will attempt to
measure the importance of each of these, but first need to replicate the results of Lau and his coauthors for one year. Using the IO table for 2000, we find that $1,000 of ordinary exports from
China leads to 0.44 person-years of employment, and $1,000 of processing exports leads to 0.13
person-years. So again, processing exports leads to about three-tenths the employment of
ordinary exports. Our estimates for 2000 are also shown in Table 3, and fall neatly in-between
the estimates of Lau et al (2004, 2006a,b), giving us some confidence that our employment
estimates are consistent with theirs.

7
The methodology we have used to obtain the static employment coefficients from the
2000 IO table is discussed in the Appendix, and is briefly summarized as follows. Denote the
sources of demand by j = D, O, P for domestic demand, ordinary exports and processing exports,
respectively. Then the portion of value-added going to labor from $1 demand of type j in sector i
j
is BLit
, which is computed from the IO table as the sum of direct plus indirect payments to

labor. Our calculations are only for 2000, which we denote t = 0, but the same calculations are
j
made by Lau et al (2004, 2006a,b) for 1995 and 2002. Having obtained these coefficients BLit

for each sector, these are averaged across sectors:

for j = O,P

P
where D it denotes domestic demand in sector j, while X O

denotes processing exports.
j
Notice the averaged terms BLt
refer to the portion of value-added going to labor. To

convert this into employment we need to divide by a wage. For the 2000 IO table, we have used
the average 2000 wage, which was $842 per year. So the static employment coefficients shown
in Table 3 for 2000 are obtained as:
CLj 0 ≡ BLj 0 / $842 , for j =D,O,P

(2)

We are unsure what wages were used by Lau et al (2004, 2006a,b) for 1995 and 2002, but the
calculation is presumably analogous to that in (2), which we will write in other years as:
j
j
CLt
≡ BLt
/ Wt .

(2')

In Table 3 we also show the static employment coefficient for domestic demand, which
equals C+I+G. For 2000, we have computed the domestic coefficients as in (1) and (2), for j=D.

8
j
For 2002, we choose CLt
so that the implied employment from domestic demand plus exports
D
just equals the actual employment in each year. That is, we have chosen CLt
so that:
D
O O
P P
CLt
D t + CLt
X t + CLt
X t = Lt ,

(3)

where Lt is employment in year t. Notice that this full-employment condition also holds in 2000
by construction of the static employment coefficients from the IO table.
Despite the fact that the static employment coefficients are obtained for a single year,
there is a strong temptation to apply them over time, i.e. to use these coefficients to predict the
future course of employment due to export growth. There are potentially large errors associated
with that procedure, however. To see this point theoretically, take the difference of (3) over a 5year period. After some simplification, we obtain the equation:

ΔL t = ΔD t

2

where ΔD t = D t − D t − 5 is the change over a 5-year interval, and likewise for every other
variable. On the first line of (4) we have the change in domestic demand and exports times the
average employment coefficients, and on the second line we have the change in the employment
coefficients times the average demand. Generally, the employment coefficients are falling over
time, as can be seen by comparing the rows of Table 3. It follows that the second line of (4) is
negative, and potentially quite large: the fall in each employment coefficient is multiplied by the
average level of demand, and not just its growth. Since the second line is negative and potentially
large, it follows that the first line on the right is potentially much larger than the actual increase
in employment.

9
This theoretical result is confirmed in Table 4, where we take the static employment
coefficients and apply them to the change in exports over the two 5-years periods, 1997-2002
and 2000-2005. In the first row of Table 4, for example, we use our estimates of the C ij0
employment coefficient from the 2000 IO table, as shown in Table 3, and multiply each of the
employment coefficients by the real change in domestic demand, ordinary exports and
processing exports over 1997–2002. That is we compute:
O
P P
Prediction 1 = ΔD t CLD0 + ΔX O
t C L0 + ΔX t CL 0 ,

(5)

which is similar to the first line of (4). From domestic demand we predict an employment
increase of 216 million persons,5 and for ordinary processing exports we predict an employment
increase of 31 million persons. Summing over these we obtain nearly 250 million workers, as
compared to an actual employment increase of only 39 million! We see that simply multiplying
the real changes in demand and exports by the employment coefficients, as in (5), massively
overstates the true change in employment.
The situation is even worse over the 2000–2005 period, where now we use the static
employment coefficients of Lau et al (2006a) from the 2002 IO table. Again we multiply the
employment coefficients by the real change in domestic demand and exports, as in (5), and
predict an increase in employment in China of 550 million workers, as compared to the actual
increase of only 37 million! Thus, the predicted employment impact vastly exceeds the actual
employment increase. The difference between the predicted and actual employment increases is
due to fall in the employment coefficients, as shown on the second line of (4).
5

The rise in domestic demand of $411.5 billion in Table 4 is taken from the IO tables for 1997 and 2002, and
exceeds the rise in domestic demand of $345.4, taken from C+I+G in the national accounts, Table 1. We use
domestic demand from the IO tables for consistency with later calculations. If instead we use the national accounts
figure to predict employment gains in Table 4, then we obtain 225 million workers over 1997–2002, which is
somewhat less than what we report in Table 4.

10
We conclude from these calculations that the static employment coefficients, times the
changes in demand, do not provide reliable estimates of the actual employment gains in China.
Reasons for this have already been suggested: the static employment coefficients do not take into
account the changing industry composition of domestic demand and exports, and the coefficients
can also fall due to technological progress and capital accumulation. We now examine each of
these explanations in turn.

3. Shifting Composition of Exports and Domestic Demand
The static employment coefficients computed from the IO table refer to the employment
impact of an additional $1,000 in average exports or domestic demand, i.e. using the same
composition of output that occurred in the year of the IO table, as shown by taking the averages
in (1). But that is not a good guide for the effects of an actual change in demand, because with
shifting comparative advantage, export growth may be in industries different from in the past. In
addition, for domestic demand the growth in China in recent years has been especially strong in
investment (as shown in Table 1), especially construction, which differs in its labor requirements
from other industries.
The growth in exports is shown in Figures 1 and 2, where we graph the percentage
increase over 2000-2005 in total and ordinary exports, respectively, and industry wages in 2000.
Regardless of whether we use total or ordinary exports, the industry with the greatest percentage
increase in exports was electronic and telecommunications equipment, and that industry also had
the highest wage in 2000.6 Overall, there is a positive correlation between the percentage growth
in exports, and the real wage in 2000, with food products and tobacco appearing as an outlier
(and a relatively small export industry). The fact that the percentage increase in exports differs
6

This industry also had by far the greatest increase in real exports over 2000-2005, exceeding $160 billion, though
the majority of those sales were for processing exports.

11
substantially across industries, meaning that the use of “average” exports as in Lau et al (2004,
2006a,b) will lead to inaccurate results. Instead, we want to use the “marginal” exports, i.e. the
actual increase in exports that occurred in each industry over the five-year period.
In theoretical terms, we want to compare the results of using aggregate employment
coefficients, as shown in Table 3, with using disaggregate sector-level coefficients. To obtain the
disaggregate results, write the full-employment condition (1) alternatively as:

∑i

O
O
P

CD
Lit D it + C Lit X it + C Lit X it = ∑i L it ,

(6)

O
P
where C D
Lit , C Lit , and C Lit are the disaggregate employment coefficients by IO sectors, and
P
likewise for domestic demand Dit, ordinary exports X O
it and processing exports X it . Taking the

difference of (6) over a 5-year interval we obtain:

By using the sectoral data in the 2000 IO table, we can make an alternative prediction of the
employment gains from the first line of (7):

Prediction 2 uses: C Li

12
Comparing the new prediction obtained from the disaggregate coefficients in (8) with that
from the aggregate coefficients in (5), since ΔD t = ∑i ΔD it and ΔX tj = ∑i ΔX itj we obtain:

(10)

If there is a negative correlation between the growth in demand and the employment coefficients
in each sector, as we would expect if growth in output occurs in the more efficient sectors, then
(10) is negative and our second prediction of employment growth is less than the first. This
reduction in employment gains come from shifts towards more productive industries, and is an
example of what Nordhaus (1992, p. 215) calls the “Denison effect.” Nordhaus refers to the work
of Edward Denison (1967, 1980), who demonstrated that if resources shift from low-productivity
to high-productivity industries, like from agriculture to manufacturing, then the economy would
show aggregate productivity growth even if sectoral productivity growth was zero in both
sectors. The aggregate productivity growth is due to a “reallocation effect” across industries. The
flip-side of this aggregate productivity growth is that the labor needed to produce any given
output is reduced, as we are showing in (10).
Another interpretation of the calculation in (8) can be obtained by taking the averages:
~
CD
L0 ≡

∑i ΔDit C DLi0 , and
∑i ΔDit

~
C Lj 0 ≡

∑i ΔX itj C Lij 0 ,
∑i ΔX itj

for j = O,P.

(11)

j
Notice that (11) is an average of the sectoral employment coefficients C Li
0 in 2000, but using

the change in domestic demand and exports as weights, rather than their average levels as in (1) (2). Again, since ΔD t = ∑i ΔD it and ΔX tj = ∑i ΔX itj , it is immediate that prediction 2 in (8) can
be alternatively written as:

13
~
O~O
P~P
Prediction 2 = ΔD t C D
L 0 + ΔX t C L 0 + ΔX t C L 0 ,

(12)

which is the change in demand times the revised employment coefficients. From (11) and (12),
we can see our second prediction of the rise in employment uses actual or “marginal” increase in
exports and domestic demand, rather than the “averages” used in (1)-(2) and (5).
In the following sections, we implement this second prediction, as well as a third variant,
using the 2000 IO table. In sections 4 and 5 we focus on the growth of exports, over 1997–2002
and 2000–2005, and in section 6 discuss the growth in domestic demand, in which case we do
not have disaggregate data for 2005 so we are restricted to investigating 1997–2002.

4. Growth of Exports, 1997–2002 and 2000–2005
In Table 5, we report the employment gains over 1997-2002 and 2000-2005 using the
disaggregate increase in exports over these two periods (prediction 2a). In the former period,
1997-2002, the employment growth is 23 million persons, rather than 31 million from Table 1.
So the shift towards more productive industries reduces the employment growth by 25% (or 17%
for ordinary exports and 52% for processing exports). A similar decline is seen over 2000-2005,
when using the actual rather than the average, increase in exports reduces employment growth
from 115 million (prediction 1) to 86 million (prediction 2a), again a decline of 25%.7 We
conclude that the employment gain from increased exports is reduced once we account for the
industry composition of exports, as suggested by Felipe and Hasan (2006a,b).
The adjustments we have made for prediction 2 can be extended in two directions: we
have the data to take into account the provincial compositions of exports, along with provincial

7

If instead of using the industry wages in prediction 2, as in (9), we instead continued to use the overall average
wage of $842 in 2000, then the predicted employment impact of exports is reduced by 15% as compared with the
first prediction. That reduction comes from using the disaggregate calculation as in (8), but with the average wage of
$842 in (9). The additional 10% reduction for prediction 2 is obtained by using the industry wages, as in (9).

14
wages by industry; or to account for the differing wages paid by types of firm-ownership (stateowned, collective, or private) and the exports by firm-ownership and industry as well as wages
by firm-ownership and industry. To the extent that exports are shifting to more productive
provinces (e.g. coastal) or firms (e.g. private), the estimated employment gains are reduced.
It should be noted that the maintained assumption in these calculations is that the national
IO table for 2000 applies equally well across provinces and across types of firm-ownership. We
have only very limited data that could be used to test this assumption. To the extent possible, we
applied the methods of Bernstein and Weinstein (2002), and found that the 2000 IO table appears
to hold reasonably well across provinces except for Guangdong (where labor compensation was
higher than predicted from the national IO table). Because Guangdong was the only outlier, and
because our ability to construct an alternative IO table for Guangdong is extremely limited, we
continued to apply the national table across all provinces, and types of firm-ownership.
Focusing first on the provincial effects (prediction 2b), accounting for the shift in exports
by industry and province further reduces the employment impact of increased exports, to 20.6
million persons over 1997-2002, or one-third less than the initial calculation. For 2000-2005, the
implied increase in employment is 77.5 million persons, which is also one-third less than the
initial calculation. The employment effects that are obtained when we instead take into account
the shift in exports by industry and firm-ownership (prediction 2c) are similar to those that take
into account provincial effects: the predicted employment gains are reduced by about one-third
from the initial calculations. The data we have available do not allow us to take into account both
of these effects at the same time. In any case, for 2000-2005 the implied increase in employment
is still much larger than the actual increase of 37 million, which calls for an explanation.

15
5. Increase in Wages due to Productivity Gains
A final limitation of the static employment coefficients computed from the IO table, and
also a limitation of our results reported in Table 5, is that we have assumed that wages are
constant over time. That is, we are using wages in 2000: either at the overall wage in (2), or the
industry wage in (9). But of course, real wages will rise over time due to both productivity gains
and capital accumulation. With rising wages, any implied increase in value-added and payments
to labor will correspond to a smaller increase in employment.
For our next calculation, we divide the direct plus indirect payments to labor from the
2000 IO table by the real 1997 and 2002 wages, respectively, when estimate labor demand in
each year. That is, we obtain the employment coefficients in each year as:
j
j
j
j
Ĉ Lit
≡ BLi
0 / Wit and Ĉ Lit − 5 ≡ B Li 0 / Wit − 5 , for j = D,O,P.

(13)

Then our third prediction of the employment gains for rising demand is:

Prediction 3 =

∑i {Dit Ĉ DLit − Dit − 5Ĉ DLit − 5 + X OitĈOLit − X Oit − 5ĈOLit − 5 + ΔX itPĈ PLit − ΔX itP − 5Ĉ PLit − 5 }.

(14)

Note that if instead of the estimates in (13), we had used the true employment coefficients
j
C Lit
obtained from the IO table in each year, then (14) would be an exact prediction of the

change in employment: there would be no error involved. So the difference between the third
prediction, which uses the industry wages in each year, and the actual changes in employment
occurs because: (i) we are using wages in (13) that do not differ between domestic and export
j
production, and (ii) we are still using coefficients B Li
0 from 2000, rather than allowing these

coefficients to change over time. In brief, we still do not accurately predict employment changes
with (14) because we are not allowing the IO table to change over time, and our wage data is not

16
detailed enough. Still, we find that this third prediction is a further improvement over our earlier
calculations.
In Table 6 we show how the implied employment effects are further reduced when we
allow for the actual increase in wages over 1997–2002 or 2000–2005. For 1997–2002, we find
that the employment gains due to ordinary exports range from 5 to 10 million (predictions 3a, 3b
and 3c), which are reduced by 55% or more as compared to the initial calculation. For processing
exports, the implied employment effects range from -1.4 to 1.7 million, a reduction of at least
80% from the initial calculation. Over this period, most of the increase in exports over these
years can be explained by the shift in workers towards more efficient industries, firms and
provinces, so the employment gain is very modest. Over 2000–2005, we also find that the
employment gains due to increased ordinary exports are reduced by 55% from our initial
calculation, while the employment gains due to processing exports are reduced by about 75%.
To sum up, our calculations have reduced the employment impact of increased exports by
more than one-half of the initial calculation for ordinary exports, and at least three-quarters for

processing exports. Are these results in Table 6 believable? The smaller employment gains
indicate an efficient reallocation of resources, which is plausible. We note that these efficiency
gains come from reallocations across many industries (as well as province and firm-ownership),
and do not simply reflect a rural-urban migration. Indeed, agriculture and manufacturing
industries tend to rise or fall together in our calculations: allowing for rising wages over time, we
find that the increase in exports is associated with rising employment in both agriculture and the
sum of all manufacturing industries. So the net changes in implied employment reported in
Tables 5 and 6 would be similar if we omitted agriculture and reported instead the changes in
manufacturing employment due to exports.

17
6. Shifting Composition of Domestic Demand, 1997–2002

To measure domestic demand we rely on the sum of C+I+G by industry from the IO
tables, which we have for the years 1997, 2000 and 2002, but not for 2005.8 So to evaluate the
change in employment due to domestic demand, we are restricted to the five-year period 19972002, and will not be able to report any results for 2000-2005. Furthermore, domestic demand is
not broken down by province nor by the type of firm-ownership. So the calculations for domestic
demand will only be broken down by industry over 1997-2002.
The implied employment increase due to the growth in domestic demand are reported in
Table 7, where we distinguish domestic demand for tradable goods (all manufacturing plus
mining and agriculture) and non-traded goods (all utilities and services, including construction).9
That is, we have re-computed the employment coefficients shown in (1)-(2) and (10)-(11) for
domestic demand by separating trade from non-traded goods. Traded goods are shown in part A
of Table 7. We find that domestic demand for tradable goods has risen by a very modest amount
in real terms over 1997-2002, $24 billion, shown in the first column. Multiplying that increase in
demand by the static employment coefficient of 0.525, we obtain a modest rise in employment of
12.7 million persons, as shown in the third column (prediction 1).
However, if instead we use the actual change in demand rather than its “average” change,
then fall in demand would actually lead to reduced employment of 10 million workers when
holding wages fixed at their 2000 levels (prediction 2). Allowing for the growth of wages
between 1997 and 2002, the implied fall in employment is even higher, 50 million workers, due
to the fall in domestic demand (prediction 3). Only a very small amount, 3.3 million workers, is
made up by the increase in demand due to rising exports, so the net change in employment due to

8
9

Imports are treated entirely as intermediate inputs in the IO table, so need not be deducted from C+I+G.
Tradable goods are defined as sectors 1-22 of the 2000 IO table, and nontradable goods as sectors 23-40.

18
domestic demand plus exports is a fall of some 47 million jobs.
Since employment actually increased by 39 million jobs over 1997-2002, the gap must be
made up by the non-traded sector, which is confirmed in the next row of Table 7. An initial
calculation using a static employment coefficient gives a rise in employment of 203 million
(prediction 1, part B). Use the actual change in demand rather than its “average” change, then the
employment increase becomes 166 million workers when holding wages fixed at their 2000
levels (prediction 2). Allowing wages to rise over 1997-2002, the employment gain in nontradable goods is 111 million workers (prediction 3). That is an enormous rise in employment
due to domestic demand, which far exceeds any of our calculations for exports. The sector with
the largest increase in domestic demand is construction, which accounts for at least half of the
overall rise in employment. Employment gains are also shown in final consumer services like
real estate, restaurants, health services, education, etc.
The changes in domestic demand for tradable and non-tradable goods are graphed in
Figure 3, along with the industry wages in 2000.10 Sectors with the greatest increase in demand
include a few tradable industries, like instruments and office machinery, and electronic and
telecommunication equipment, but many more non-traded goods: real estate, restaurants,
scientific research, education, public administration, health and social services, etc. At the far
right of the figure, sectors like textile, wearing apparel, food products, furniture and agriculture
all have negative growth in real demand over 1997–2002. We find it quite remarkable that the
rapidly growing Chinese economy did not generate more domestic demand for its own tradable
goods over this period! Domestic demand should be treated as a viable alternative to exports as a
source of employment growth, but did not function in that way, presumably because the income
gains in China did not lead to a commensurate rise in consumption. Aziz and Cui (2007) argue
10

For convenience we omit the petroleum and mining sectors in Figure 3, as well as several other smaller sectors.

19
that one reason for this outcome is that household income did not rise by as much as GDP.
That estimate for rising employment due to non-traded goods can be combined with the
fall in employment in tradable goods, to obtain a total implied change in employment of 111–50
= 61 million workers (prediction 3, part C). That is our final estimate for 1997-2002. In principle,
this estimate of 61 million jobs added over 1997-2002, from both domestic demand and exports,
should equal the actual gain in employment of 39 million jobs. The discrepancy between these
numbers (25 million) can be due to multiple causes: we have not been able to distinguish
domestic demand by firm-ownership or province; we have used a fixed 2000 IO table; and the
wage data we use is not as detailed as we would like. But we feel that even if these improvement
were made to our calculations, the overall message of Table 7 would not change: the vast
majority of job growth over 1997-2002 is due to the increase in demand for non-traded goods,
especially the construction sector. The main reason that employment has grown as much as it has
in China over 1997-2002 is due to the increase in domestic demand for non-tradable goods!
Furthermore, it is important to recognize that our final estimate of 61 million job gained
over 1997–2002, from prediction 3, is vastly better than our initial calculation of 216 million
jobs (prediction 1, part C). Comparing these two numbers, we see that the initial calculation is
reduced by 72% due to the adjustments we have made. That is nearly the same adjustment (75%)
that we found in the previous section for processing trade, but larger than the adjustment (45%)
that we found for ordinary exports. It is noteworthy that a downwards adjustment of 45% is
shown in Table 7 for the nontradable sector, where the employment gains were reduced from 203
million in our initial calculation to 61 million (prediction 3). The fact that total employment
generated from domestic demand is revised downwards by nearly 75% reflects the very weak
growth in demand for tradable goods, leading to negative employment gains once we account for

20
the industry composition of demand and wage increases over time. In other words, the “Denison
effect” operates very strongly in the pattern of domestic demand for tradable goods, as we have
already seen for exports.11

7. Implied Growth in Employment Once Again

Let us now summarize what we have learned from the last three sections, and return to
the calculations of employment growth. In Table 8 we show again the static employment
coefficients for 2000 (our calculations) and 2002 (from Lau et al, 2006a,b). We found in section
2 that those coefficients vastly overstate the actual change in employment over 1997–2002 or
2000–2005. But by using improved calculations, we were able to reduce the predicted
employment growth. Our final calculations showed that the employment growth for ordinary
exports was 55% lower than obtained from the static employment coefficients, while that
employment growth from processing exports and domestic demand were 75% lower (and
possibly more). We apply those rules of thumb to the initial static employment coefficients to
obtain revised employment coefficients, as shown in Table 8.
For example, instead of the initial calculations for the 2000 IO table, we now predict that
$1000 in ordinary exports generates 0.44×0.45 = 0.20 person-years of employment, while $1000
in processing exports or domestic demand generates 0.13×0.25 = 0.03 and 0.53×0.25 = 0.13
person-years, respectively. For 2002, we now predict that $1000 in ordinary exports generates
0.36×0.45 = 0.16 person-years of employment, while $1000 processing exports of domestic
demand generates 0.11×0.25 = 0.03 and 0.44×0.25 = 0.11 person-years, respectively. These

11

Note that in Figure 3, the industry with tradable-good industry with the highest percentage increase in domestic
demand is instruments and office machinery, followed by electronic and telecommunication equipment. The latter
industry has among the highest wage of any tradable industry, and also shows the highest percentage increase in
exports (both for ordinary and processing exports).

21
estimates are upper-bounds, since we obtained lower employment impacts in some calculations,
but we shall use these adjustments as conservative.
We use the revised employment coefficients in Table 8 to re-calculate the employment
gains for both periods, as shown in Table 9. For 1997–2002, we find that the growth in domestic
demand (for nontradable goods, in particular), leads to an increase in employment of 67 million
workers. In addition, the growth in exports (for ordinary exports, especially), leads to an increase
in employment of 12 million workers, or about 2.5 million workers per year. Summing over
domestic demand and exports, we predict employment gains of 79 million from 1997–2002, as
compared to the actual employment increase of 39 million.12 So our prediction is still twice as
big as the actual gain, but that is a great improvement over our initial calculation (Table 4) where
the predicted employment gain was 216 million – more than five times greater than the actual
increase! The gap between our revised employment gain over 1997–2002 and the actual is due to
j
from the IO table, reflecting technological progress and
the fall in the labor coefficients BLit

capital accumulation.
In later period, 2000–2005, the growth in domestic demand and exports are both stronger.
We again use the revised employment coefficient from Table 8 for 2002, and multiply those by
the real changes in domestic demand and exports. We find that the growth in domestic demand
(especially investment), leads to an increase in employment of 114 million workers. In addition,
the growth in exports adds employment of another 38 million workers. By coincidence, the
predicted employment impact of exports is nearly exactly equal to the actual rise in employment
of 37 million workers, or 7.5 million per year.
12

Note that the predicted employment gains in Table 9 are not exactly the same as the final row of Table 7,
because in Table 9 we are using the rules of thumb shown in Table 8 to reduce the static employment coefficients,
i.e. the coefficient for ordinary exports is reduced by 55%, and the coefficients for processing exports and domestic
demand are reduced by 75%. Those rules of thumb are broadly consistent but not identical to the calculations in the
final row of Table 7.

22
However, the role of domestic demand over 2000–2005, which added 114 million to
employment is actually three-times large than the role of exports. Based on that evidence, we
could not refute the claim that domestic demand is responsible for the employment increase.
Whether we want to claim that it is domestic demand or exports that are responsible is really just
an exercise in semantics, however: the fact is that both have played an important role in
stimulating employment growth, and the sum of them (152 million) is still considerably larger
than the actual employment gains (37.4 million) over this period. Again, we would attribute the
gap between the predicted and actual employment gains as due to technological progress and
capital accumulation, as well as illustrating the limits of how far we can push our calculations
from the IO table. We have made a substantial improvement over the initial calculations, whose
predictions were off by an order of magnitude, but still have not obtained a precise accounting of
the causes of employment growth.

8. Conclusions

Dooley et al (2003, 2004a,b,c) argue that the current systems of current account
imbalances is sustainable so long as China is willing to absorb the Treasury bills used to finance
the U.S. deficits. And that willingness is tied to its desire to move workers from unproductive
rural employment into urban, manufacturing jobs. These authors suggest that China needs to reemploy some 200 million persons from the countryside, or 10-12 million persons per year in the
urban areas, and that growth in exports will explain about 30% if these employment gains.
We have evaluated this hypothesis by using calculations on the employment impact of
exports, and domestic demand, from Chinese IO tables. We have started with the calculations of
Lau et al (2004, 2006a,b) for 1995 and 2002, and added our own calculation for the 2000 IO
table. The “static employment coefficients” obtained from these tables summarize the amount of

23
employment generated by $1000 in exports or domestic demand for one year. By construction,
these static employment coefficients are consistent with the full-employment condition for the
economy. But the static employment coefficients do a very poor job at predicting the future
growth in employment from the future growth in exports or domestic demand. We have shown
that the errors involved in this forward-looking forecast are enormous, which means that the
static employment coefficients are highly unreliable for that purpose.
To improve on that situation, we have proposed adjustments to the static employment
coefficients. These adjustments take into account the future growth in export and domestic
industries, which may be quite different from their former growth, as well as rising wages over
time. The adjustments partially close the gap between predicted and actual employment growth,
even when using an IO table for a single year. Using the revised employment coefficients, we
find that export growth over 1997-2002 explains at most one-third of the total employment
growth in the economy (2.5 out of 7.5–8 million workers per year). For 2000–2005, however,
export growth was faster, and in principle can explain the entire employment growth of 7.5
million workers per year. However, the rise in domestic demand – especially for investment –
generated employment gains that are three-times larger than those for exports, which confirms
the relative importance of exports as compared to domestic demand suggested by Dooley et al
(2004b). The same amount of employment is reduced by productivity growth in the economy, so
the net gain is back to 7.5 million workers per year, somewhat less than the goal put forth by
Dooley et al (2003, 2004a,b,c).
The other key finding is that over 1997–2002, the rise in domestic demand was nearly
entirely in the nontradable sector: predicted employment for tradable goods actually fell. This is

very surprising, but reflects the shift in expenditure in China towards construction projects as

24
well as nontradable consumer goods. We do not have the detailed data to evaluate whether the
same shift occurred during 2000–2005, but from the aggregate GDP data, there has been
substantially faster growth in investment I instead of private and public consumption C+G. So
we speculate that domestic demand for tradable goods continues to lag, despite the newspaper
reports of rising consumer expenditures; this view is also put forth by Aziz and Cui (2007), who
point to the slow growth in household income as an explanation.
The importance of this finding is that China could certainly turn towards domestic
demand instead of export (and consumer expenditures, in particular) as an engine to stimulate
employment. The transition from export-led growth to domestic demand would undoubtedly rely
on many economic and policy actions that are now only beginning: a real appreciation as the
prices of non-tradable goods begin to rise, shifting domestic demand towards both imports and
exportable goods; accompanied by some nominal appreciation of the yuan; fiscal policies that
allow for greater security of income in old age, allowing higher expenditures today; reform of the
banking sector; etc. Readers are referred to Aziz (2006), Aziz and Dunaway (2007), and
Anderson (2007) for further policy discussions. We believe that it is these features – and not the
reliance on export-led growth – that should determine the future path of the government and
trade accounts in China and ultimately restore greater balance to these accounts.

ALD , ALO , ALP are correspondingly the direct labor demand generated by one dollar
production of domestic products, ordinary export, or processing exports.
E O and E P are each an n ×1 vector of ordinary export and processing export respectively.

Total Value Added (VA) Coefficient Matrix

To calculate the total economy value added, we must consider the linkages between
sectors. When one unit domestic product is produced, it generates a first round of value added,
which is the direct value added AVD . However, in order to produce this unit of domestic product,

26
intermediate inputs must be used. The production of these intermediate inputs hence create the
second round of value added, which is named indirect value added ( AVD ⋅ A DD ). This process of
creating indirect value added can continue on and on, as intermediate inputs are needed to
produce other intermediate inputs. Therefore, the total domestic VA induced by a unit domestic
production is the sum of first round direct domestic VA and all the indirect domestic VA. Hence,
we derive the total domestic VA coefficient ( BVD ) aroused by domestic production as:

(

BVD = AVD + AVD ⋅ A DD + AVD ⋅ A DD ⋅ A DD + AVD ⋅ A DD

= AVD ⋅ I − A

Similarly, producing one unit of ordinary or processing export products also requires
domestic made intermediate goods, which in turn generates many rounds of VA from these
domestic intermediate inputs. We thus have:

BVP = AVP + BVD ⋅ A DP

BVO = AVO + BVD ⋅ A DO

where BVi represents the total VA coefficient vector for production i, for i= D (domestic), O

Other Data

In Table A2 we show the allocation of value-added to labor and capital, along with the
share of value-added within the sum of value-added plus imports used for each type of
production: domestic production, ordinary exports, and processing exports. For each type of
production, about one-half of value-added goes towards compensating labor, with the remainder
divided between capital income (one-third) and taxes on production (one-sixth). The amount of
value-added differs a great deal across type of production, however: it is 94% of the sum of
value-added plus imports used in domestic production, 62% for ordinary exports, and 20% for
processing exports.
We have also confirmed that the employment levels in Table 1 are consistent with the IO
table itself, as described in Table A3. In the first column we list the economy-wide compensation
to labor from the various years of the IO tables, and in the next columns the real agricultural and
manufacturing wages (in US$, 2000). China employs one-half of its workers in agriculture and
one-half in manufacturing, so we take the simple average of these two wages to obtain the

29
average wage, which is $842 in 2000, for example. Dividing the labor compensation from the IO
table by the average wage, we obtain employment of 716.5 million persons in 2000, which is
very close to the 720.5 million persons reported in Table 1.
For years before and after 2000, however, there is an inconsistency between the actual
employment figures reported by the China Statistical Yearbook, in the last column of Table 4,
and the implied employment obtained by dividing total compensation from the IO tables by
average wages from the China Statistical Yearbook, in the second-last column. Implied
employment even falls over 1997–2002, which does not seem believable. The problem appears
to be an inconsistency between the wage series we use (from the China Statistical Yearbook) and
the wages that are implicit in the IO tables, at least in 1997 and 2002.13 It is essential that the
implied employment from the IO table in each year equal actual employment in the economy. To
achieve this, we inflate the 1997 wages from the China Statistical Yearbook by 8%, and deflate
the 2002 wages by 4%, obtaining the revised wages reported in the bottom of Table 4. Those
adjusted wages lead to implied employment from the IO tables that is roughly equal to that
reported by the China Statistical Yearbook. We will continue to use this simple adjustment to
1997 and 2002 wages in all our calculations.

13

For 2000, when we have the most complete IO table available, it lists both labor compensation and employment
at the end of the year. So the wages being used in the Io table can be computed, and they are highly consistent with
both the wages and actual employment figures used in Table 4 for 2000. For 1997 and 2002, however, the IO table
is less complete, and in particular, does not list employment so that implied wages cannot be computed.

Notes:
1. Average wage is the simple average of manufacturing and agriculture sectors. Source for wage data is the China
Statistical Yearbook, 2006.
2. Implied employment = real compensation from IO table / real average wage.
3. Actual employment data come from China Statistical Yearbook of each year.
4. The revised wage data multiplies 1997 wages by 1.08, and multiplies 2002 wages by 0.96 , so that the implied
employment is roughly equal to actual employment.
