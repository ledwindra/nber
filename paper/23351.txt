ABSTRACT
We study how heterogeneity in performance evaluations across supervisors affects employee and
supervisor careers and firm outcomes using data on the performance system of a Scandinavian
service sector firm. We show that supervisors vary widely in how they rate subordinates of
similar quality. To understand the nature of this heterogeneity, we propose a principal-agent
model according to which supervisors can differ in their ability to elicit output from subordinates
or in their taste for leniency when rating subordinates. The model also allows for variation in how
informed firms are about this heterogeneity. Within the context of this model, we can discern the
nature of the heterogeneity across supervisors and how informed firms are about this
heterogeneity by relating estimated supervisor heterogeneity in ratings to worker, supervisor, and
firm outcomes. We find that subordinates matched to a high-rating supervisor are paid
significantly more and their pay is more closely aligned with performance. We also find that
higher raters themselves are paid more and that the teams managed by higher raters perform
better on objective performance measures. This evidence suggests that supervisor heterogeneity
stems, at least in part, from real differences in managerial ability and that firms are at least
partially informed about these differences. We conclude by quantifying how important
heterogeneity in supervisor type is for workers' careers. For a typical worker, matching to a high
rater (90th percentile) relative to a low rater (10th percentile) for just one year results in an
increase in the present discounted value of earnings equivalent to 6-12 percent of an annual
salary.

INTRODUCTION

Subjective performance evaluations are a ubiquitous and controversial feature of the modern workplace.
Firms use these evaluations as indicators of worker performance and skills. They aect employee compensation, task assignment, promotions and retention (Frederiksen, Lange, and Kriechel, 2017). However, ratings
are also aected by the identity of the rater: the worker's supervisor.

For one, performance evaluations

are inherently subjective, so supervisors might dier widely in how they rate equivalent behavior. Furthermore, supervisors have been shown to dier in their ability to manage subordinates, thus aecting how their
subordinates perform on the job (Bertrand and Schoar, 2003; Lazear, Shaw, and Stanton, 2015).

These

dierences in the ability to manage will plausibly inuence the performance ratings subordinates receive.
Little is known, however, about the extent and nature of ratings heterogeneity across supervisors, the degree
to which rms are informed about such heterogeneity, and how it impacts workers' careers.
If supervisors give dierent ratings for the same underlying performance, then this will undermine the
performance management system.

It will burden workers with unneccesary risk and limit rms ability

to use performance evaluations for setting incentives.

As a consequence, rms may desire to counteract

any heterogeneity with forced curves or other rules restricting the discretion supervisors have when rating
subordinates. However, such policies may unintentionally interfere with how supervisors manage their teams
if heterogeneity in ratings instead stems from real dierences in a manager's ability to elicit output.
In this paper, we strive to estimate the magnitude and understand the nature of the heterogeneity
in subjective ratings across supervisors.

Using an exceptionally rich data set containing the performance

management system of a Scandinavian service sector rm, we uncover substantial heterogeneity in ratings
across supervisors: we estimate that a worker receives a 30 percent boost in ratings when assigned to a onestandard-deviation higher-rating supervisor. This heterogeneity is economically important: being assigned
to a high rater (at the 90th percentile of the ratings distribution) for just one year is associated with an
increase in the present discounted value of lifetime earnings at the rm equivalent to 6 to 12 percent of
annual earnings, relative to being assigned to a low rater (10th percentile). The evidence strongly suggests
that supervisors have important impacts on workers' careers inside the rm.
We develop a simple analytic framework to guide our empirical analysis.

This framework allows su-

pervisors to dier both in managerial ability and in their preferences for leniency when giving ratings.
Furthermore, the model allows the degree to which rms are informed about dierences across supervisors
to vary. In the context of this model, we interpret how supervisor heterogeneity in ratings correlates with
outcomes of subordinates, supervisors, and teams inside the rm. Both subordinates and supervisors earnings are higher and teams perform better on objective output metrics when the supervisors are high raters.

3

Because of these ndings, we conclude that heterogeneity in ratings is driven primarily by real dierences in
managerial ability that rms are at least partially informed about.
We follow a long tradition in personnel economics and postulate that the central human resource challenge
facing the rm is to incentivize workers to exert eort (Holmstrom, 1979; Holmstrom and Milgrom, 1987;
Lazear, 2000). The three actors in our model are the workers without supervisory function, the supervisors,
and the rm. Neither rms nor supervisors directly observe the eort workers exert. Supervisors observe
worker output and report on this output to the rm. Supervisors dier along two dimensions. First, they
vary in how much weight they place on reporting ratings truthfully as opposed to favorably. We refer to
this heterogeneity as leniency bias.

1 Second, they dier in their managerial ability, which aects their

subordinates marginal costs of eort (or, equivalently, the output per unit eort).

Given this setup, we

consider the optimal linear compensation contracts of workers as well as salary contracts for supervisors.
Our model also allows us to ask how the optimal contracts depend on how informed rms are about the
dierences between supervisors.

This model yields comparative statics that we can take to the data to

disentangle whether ratings heterogeneity is largely driven by leniency or ability and whether rms are
largely informed or uninformed about such heterogeneity.
In our empirical analysis, we rst estimate how much dispersion there is in ratings across supervisors using
the observed dispersion in supervisor xed eects from a regression of performance ratings on supervisor and
worker xed eects, as well as controls. This estimate adjusts for the well-known correlated measurement
error problem inherent in double xed eects models (see Andrews, Gill, Schank, and Upward (2008),
Card, Heining, and Kline (2013), and Kline, Saggio, and Solvsten (2018)).

We then estimate how rater

heterogeneity correlates with outcomes of subordinates, supervisors, and teams. In this analysis, we use a
variety of approaches to account for measurement error in the key explanatory variable, rater heterogeneity:
we use a split-sample instrumental variables approach that is robust to misspecifying the contemporaneous
error structure as well as estimates based on either the xed eects directly or the bias correction discussed
above.

2

We nd that subordinates of high raters are paid more than subordinates matched to low raters. This
nding could be explained, in the context of our model, as being driven by heterogeneity in managerial

1 Guilford (1954) introduced leniency bias to describe stable dierences across raters in how they rate others that are unrelated
to productive dierences among ratees.

2 Attemps to estimate the variation in unobserved heterogeneity in wages across workers and rms using xed eects estimates

commonly run into the problem that the latter are estimated with error (e.g., Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis, 1999). In our
analysis, we estimate the variation in worker and supervisor eects in ratings (the unobserved eects) using the heteroskedasticity
robust estimator of Kline, Saggio, and Solvsten (2018). We then worker outcomes such as earnings onto the unobserved worker
and supervisor eects. To correct for bias here, we adapt the Andrews et al. (2008) approach (which requires homoskedasticity)
to a stacked system of equations with a double xed eect structure.

This allows us to estimate a bias-adjusted variance-

covariance matrix of the unobserved eects in performance ratings and earnings, which we then use to compute regression
coecients.

ability, or by heterogeneity in leniency about which the rm is uninformed.

However, we also nd that

teams managed by high raters tend to outperform those managed by low raters on a set of objective criteria
available at the branch level; we nd a similar eect when we examine individual nancial performance
measures available for a small subsample. These ndings are consistent with heterogeneity in ability across
managers - more capable managers lower the eort costs and increase the output of their team members. Two
further ndings corroborate this interpretation. First, higher raters earn more themselves, suggesting they
are more valued by the rm. Second, pay of subordinates working for higher raters tends to be more closely
aligned with their performance, as implied by our model if high raters are also better managers. Finally,
workers matched to higher raters self-report that they are more satised with their immediate supervisors
and we nd suggestive evidence that they are less likely to change supervisors or quit the rm, though these
latter results are less robust. This suggests workers benet from being matched to a high rater, even though
they also exert more eort.
Within the context of our model, our empirical ndings have a consistent and clear interpretation:
higher raters tend to be better managers and the rm has some but not perfect information on who the
better managers are. That higher raters are better managers explains why their teams perform better on
objective criteria.

Furthermore, subordinates of better managers/higher raters tend to exert more eort,

which explains why they are paid more. When the rm is at least partially informed about who the better
managers are, they reward better managers with higher compensation. In addition, they optimally expose
subordinates of better managers to stronger incentives since better managers reduce the marginal cost of
eort of their subordinates. We also nd evidence that suggests that employees earn economic rents from
working for higher raters: their jobs are more stable and they report higher work satisfaction when working
for high raters. This leads us to conclude that the rm is not fully informed about the ratings heterogeneity
across supervisors, since it would otherwise extract these rents. Consistent with this notion, we nd that
rents attenuate for supervisors with higher tenure, about whom the rm presumably has more information.
We go beyond the connes of our static model to quantify how much rather heterogeneity aects the
careers of workers. We allow dierences across supervisors to dynamically impact worker pay, both directly
and through promotion probabilities. We nd that assignment to a higher rater has lasting positive eects
on individual compensation. This arises because the eects on pay persist for some time and because being
matched with a high rater increases the odds of a promotion. We thus conclude that better managers have
large and real impacts on the careers of their subordinates: for a typical worker, matching to a high rater
(90th percentile) relative to a low rater (10th percentile) for just one year results in an increase in the present
discounted value of earnings equivalent to 6 to 12 percent of an annual salary.
Our work contributes to several important literatures in personnel and labor economics. The literature on

productivity eects of managers predominantly studies upper management and CEOs (Bennedsen, PerrezGonzales, Wolfenzon 2007; Bertrand and Schoar, 2003; Kaplan, Klebanov, and Sorensen 2012). Ours is one
of the few papers to explore productivity eects of supervisors lower in the rm hierarchy. Lazear, Shaw, and
Stanton (2015) exploit the daily rotation of line managers to estimate how productivity of subordinates in a

nd that supervisors dier in their ability to elicit output from subordinates. In contrast to their setting, we
study workers performing complex tasks for whom objective measures of performance are intrinsically hard
to come by. To do so, we must estimate a model of behavior when information is imperfect. Our analysis
exploits both objective and subjective measures of productivity, as well as worker and supervisor pay and
career outcomes within the rm.

We conclude that subjective evaluations and objective performance are

closely related and that the rm is at least partially informed about the dierences in productivity across
supervisors. Our paper thus complements Lazear, Shaw, and Stanton (2015) in nding large productivity
dierences across supervisors in a very dierent setting than the simple service sector jobs they consider. We
go beyond their analysis and provide an approach for understanding variation in manager behavior in a more
typical setting where objective performance metrics are dicult to craft and rms instead rely on subjective
ratings. Our analysis sheds light on the crucial role lower and middle managers play in the wide-spread and
growing use of subjective ratings systems.
We contribute to a small literature in economics on the role and use of subjective performance measures

4

by directly addressing whether the key subjective component of ratings, the supervisor eect, contains bias.

The question of bias in subjective evaluations has been taken up in an extensive literature in personnel
psychology.

This literature, however, rarely goes beyond documenting the presence of bias and tends to

think of the rm as passive in the face of any reporting biases.

Our approach is economic in the sense

that we allow the rm to actively respond to the presence of bias in subjective ratings in designing its
performance systems. Integrating the behavioral responses of the various actors improves our understanding
of performance management inside the rm.
Even though we allow for bias related to supervisors in subjective evaluations, our approach emphasizes
that subjective evaluations are informative about dierences in skills across workers.

This is important

for an inuential literature in labor and personnel economics that emphasizes the importance of employer

3 Bloom and Van Reenen (2007) show substantial heterogeneity in management practices across rms.

More recently, Homan

and Tadelis (2018) nd evidence that manager people skills are an important driver of subordinate retention.

4 Concerns

over how to interpret subjective performance ratings go back to Medo and Abraham (1980, 1981), at least. An

overview of this literature can be found in Frederiksen, Lange, and Kriechel (2018). They summarize empirical patterns in the
data on subjective performance evaluations from six of the more prominent papers in this literature, including Baker, Gibbs,
and Holmstrom (1994a, 1994b), Flabbi and Ichino (2001), Dohmen (2004), Gibbs and Hendriks (2004), Frederiksen and Takats
(2011), and Frederiksen (2013). Theoretical papers on the topic include Tirole (1986), Milgrom (1988), Prendergast and Topel
(1993, 1996), and MacLeod (2003).

of supervisor bias, rms can learn about worker productivity using subjective performance evaluations even
when, as it is true in most modern workplaces, good objective measures of individual performance are not
available.
Overall, our paper demonstrates that rater heterogeneity is an important feature of the employment
relationship at this rm and has sizable impacts on the careers and outcomes of employees and supervisors,
as well as for the rm itself. Rater heterogeneity cannot simply be interpreted as dierential leniency bias.
Instead, it is part and parcel of dierential ability of managing and eliciting eort from subordinates. This
nding is true in the rm we study and naturally may depend on the setting, but the concept that managerial
heterogeneity in ratings should be taking seriously and can be diagnosed with observable data is novel and
important.

On a practical level, thisour ndings suggest caution in addressing rater heterogeneity using

practices such as forced scales or disincentivizing deviations from rating norms. Such practices might well

6

interfere with the ability of supervisors to eectively manage their teams.
The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows.

Section 2 introduces the rm and the data at our

disposal and presents new stylized facts on heterogeneity across managers in subjective performance ratings.
In Section 3 we develop the model and show what it implies for how earnings and performance are related to
rater heterogeneity. Section 4 contains the empirical analysis proposed by our model. Section 5 investigates
the dynamic eects of supervisors on pay. Section 6 concludes.

FIRM AND DATA

2.1 Firm Overview
We rely on personnel data covering the domestic workforce of a large Scandinavian service sector rm
between 2004 and 2014. The performance management system was introduced just prior to 2004, when our
data begins. At any given time, the rm employed about 13,000 workers. This number uctuates slightly
over the years but does not exhibit a discernible trend. The workforce at this rm is highly educated and
the rm is known to be an attractive employer. We briey summarize the rm and data here, and provide
more detail in Appendix A.
The rm consists of a central corporate oce and an extensive branch network with several hundred

Altonji and Pierret (2001), Farber and Gibbons (1996), Gibbons and Waldman (1999, 2006), Lange (2007), and Kahn

and Lange (2014).

theoretical work on the trade-o between rules and discretion inside rms, see Bolton and Dewatripont (2012), Dessein

(2002), Alonso and Matouschek (2008), Aghion and Tirole (1997), and Li, Matouschek, and Powell (2017). On the empirical
side, Homan, Kahn, and Li (2018) nd that managers perform worse than an algorithm when choosing hires in a low-skilled
service sector setting. This contrasts our own nding and suggests the value of managerial subjective assessments varies across
settings.

branches.

7 The workforce is roughly equally split across the central oce and the branch network. Tasks

within the branch network are fairly uniform and involve close contact with clients, while workers in the
central oce serve a variety of functions.

Branches vary in size but the median employee in the branch

network works in a branch with 17 employees. Our analysis covers all employees of the rm, regardless of
whether they work in a branch or in the central oce.
There are 11 identiable job levels. The typical branch has a branch manager (levels 911), a deputy
branch manager (levels 89), 69 senior (level 6) and 5-7 junior (levels 3-5) workers in client-facing roles, and
sometimes a trainee (level 1). In the central oce, the distribution of jobs tends somewhat more towards
higher level jobs. Churn is fairly low at this rm and there is some movement between the branch network
and the central oce.
Our data contains compensation measures, positions within the rm, and demographics. In addition, as
part of the performance management system, each worker receives a rating from a supervisor. We observe
these ratings, as well as a link to the supervisor responsible for the rating. The rating is meant to describe
overall performance in a given year. In the branches, ratings are typically provided by the branch manager
or by a deputy branch manager. In the central oce, the titles are dierent, but ratings usually come from
the immediate supervisor.
Compensation decisions at this rm are made roughly once a year  timed to follow the performance
review period  and involve input from actors all along the hierarchy.

Workers receive salaries and are

eligible for bonuses. In any given year, only a fraction of employees will however receive a bonus (see Table
2.) The overall pay pool is set at the top of the rm. It is then broken down to divisions below, cascading
down to managers at lower levels of the hierarchy.

Typically a pay pool will be set for 10-15 employees

either in a branch or subdivision of corporate. From there, managers have a fair amount of discretion to
allocate both raises and bonuses from these set pay pools. The pay pool for a given branch or division is set
based on historical patterns, nancials, other performance indicators, union negotiations, and macroeconomic
conditions. Lower level managers also provide input into the process of determining the pay pool for their
units. For example, a manager might argue that unit A outperformed unit B and request a larger pool for
the former. Managers also report upwards that individual workers or teams require larger raises/bonuses, for
retention reasons, because they performed extraordinary tasks, or because a promotion cannot immediately
be accommodated.
This compensation system might be described as a exible hybrid between a top-down and bottom-up
system. The top-down structure allows upper level management to keep control of the total wage bill. At
the same time, lower level managers do report on the conditions and needs of their units and inuence how

some ability to give one worker a bit more without necessarily taking away from another team member.
The rm is aware that rigid constraints on compensation choices for small groups of workers would make
cooperation in teamwork settings dicult.

2.2 Estimation Sample and Summary Statistics
Our estimation sample consists of 85,269 full-time worker-year observations. Appendix A.2 details our sample
restrictions. The most important is the requirement that an observation has a performance rating. About a
quarter of workers lack a performance measure, largely because the performance system took a few years to
be fully rolled out. In 2004, 43 percent received performance ratings but the system spread rapidly; by 2008,
83 percent of the employees were covered. The coverage stayed at that level or slightly above throughout the
remainder of the sample period (through 2014). Workers are also less likely to have a performance review
during their rst and last years at the rm, simply because they may not be present during the review
period.

9

This estimation sample serves to identify the supervisor eects central to our analysis.

Within this

sample, we have 77,682 observations with a compensation measure (compensation is not available in our
nal year of data, 2014), stemming from 14,214 unique workers.

We also take advantage of information

from worker satisfaction surveys, nancial performance, and branch-level objective performance measures.
As detailed below, availability of these variables is often limited to subsets of the data, which implies that
the number of observations sometimes varies across empirical specications.
The performance ratings range from 1 (unsatisfactory) to 5 (outstanding). The distribution of the performance score is shown in Table 1. As is common among companies using subjective evaluations (Frederiksen,
Lange, and Kriechel, 2018), the ratings are concentrated in a small subset of the support: 91 percent of

10

ratings are either a 3 or a 4.

8 For

For this reason, our empirical investigation is built around a pass-fail

example, in a university setting, the provost will set the pay pool for divisions, such as Arts and Sciences, and then

deans will distribute this pay pool to academic departments, where nally a chair might have some discretion in allocating
raises and bonuses within their department. In this process, there is feedback up the hierarchy as well. For example, members
of the individual academic departments will have an easier time assessing performance of its professors, and determining who
might need a retention raise or who should be brought up for a promotion case, etc. This feedback would naturally impact the
overall compensation received by members of the department.

9 There

is some systematic variation in who receives ratings in that more stable workers (e.g., those with higher tenure

and those outside of the lowest job levels) are more likely to be rated. However, after controlling for year eects, remaining
observables such as tenure or job level have little power in predicting whether an individual will be missing a performance
rating.

10 The

rm does not restrict the distribution of performance ratings a manager can give, but it does encourage supervisors

to use the full scale, and holds training meetings every so often to help supervisors calibrate their ratings. The distribution of
ratings at this rm is consistent with that observed in other rms we are familiar with (see Frederiksen, Lange, and Kriechel
(2018)).

Table 2 provides summary statistics for the estimation sample. We report earnings (and its components)
relative to average per capita earnings in this country. Earnings average 185 percent of the national mean,
consistent with this being a sought-after rm with skilled workers. Roughly 30 percent of the workers receive
a bonus, and the bonus pool has historically been close to 6 percent of the wage pool.

describe this mobility in more detail in Appendix A.3.

Our data contain two measures of objective performance. During 20072010, we have rankings of branches
within peer-groups dened by the rm.

The rankings are based on a set of Key Performance Indicators

(KPIs) and include measures of nancial performance of the branches, as well as other metrics (for example,
customer satisfaction). The set of KPIs changes from year to year as the rm's focus evolves. Branches are
placed into peer groups based on size and customer base, and these peer groups vary from year to year. The
average peer group has 17 branches. We call these branch rankings KPI rankings hereafter. As reported
in Table 2, the average rating (ranking divided by number of branches in the peer group) was 0.53.
Our second measure of objective performance refers to nancial performance of a subset of individual
employees working in the branch network. We cannot reveal the precise content of these nancial measures,

11 We

adopt this terminology for ease of exposition. Naturally, the rm does not report to workers that they have failed

their review, and their interpretation may be more nuanced.

12 About

half of exits from the sample are due to quits or layos and half are workers who temporarily do not meet our criteria

for having non-missing performance. Among the latter are many who are exiting the rm in the following business year just
prior to receiving a performance rating.

13 We

take a two-year perspective because workers are less likely to receive a performance review in their last year at the rm.

Worker exit rates are higher in the unrestricted sample, which includes workers who do not receive ratings. We believe this is
because, as noted, more stable workers are somewhat more likely to receive ratings.

14 None

of these variables are dened in the last year of data, since they are right censored.

Note: The summary statistics are reported for the sample used to estimate the fixed effects in the ratings equation (see section
2). Not all variables are available for all observations in this sample. "Pass" is our constructed performance measure that equals
1 if the subjective performance evaluation was 4 or 5, and equals 0 if it was 1, 2, or 3. Stay in firm, in business unit, with
supervisor, promotion and demotion refer to any change in the worker's status over the next year. Business unit is the branch
or function in the central office. KPI rating is the branch-level ranking divided by the number of peer branches in the
comparison set. Financial performance is the year-over-year growth rate of the individual's financial portfolio. Bottom-up
evaluation is the average of seven questions workers answer regarding their satisfication with their supervisors. Responses
range from 1 to 10; we average answers on all responses and norm the variable to have a standard deviation of 1. "In
Branches" equals 1 if the worker was in the branch network and 0 if in the central corporate office.

but one way to think about them is the following: Employees in client-facing roles administer a portfolio
of clients and over the year these portfolios produce returns. We have information on these returns for the
years 2014 and 2015. The measure we use is the year-over-year growth rate of the value of the portfolio.
We refer to these measures as nancial performance hereafter. In these years, the average growth rate was
-0.07, though this is only for a subset of the rm's overall nancial performance.
We also have access to job satisfaction surveys. These surveys include questions about the employees'

score is 10. Our outcome measure, hereafter bottom-up evaluations, takes an average across these questions,

16

normed to have a standard deviation of 1. The average of this measure is 4.7.

In our analysis, we control for both worker and supervisor characteristics. Supervisors are on average
only about one year older than the average employee (45.2 vs. 44 years), and have one and a half more years
of tenure in the rm (19.6 vs. 18 years).
In summary, we have unusually rich panel data with information on the vertical and horizontal structure
of the rm, the careers of individuals, subjective performance evaluations and the identities of the raters,
measures of objective performance and survey responses from worker satisfaction surveys. We know of no
equivalent data set in the literature.

16 It

is unusual to have employee satisfaction data merged with personnel les (Frederiksen, 2017). Employers  including

our rm  usually contract with outside consulting companies to conduct employee satisfaction surveys. This is done with the
primary purpose of maintaining the employees' anonymity. By collecting the data at arm's length, the rms hope to induce
truthful reporting by employees. The consulting rms then typically report to the rm the average employee satisfaction scores
at the branch/unit/department level. As researchers we were able to obtain individual survey responses and merge them onto
the personnel records. Hence, we know how a given employee evaluates his or her superior, even though the rm itself was
not able to make this link. Supplements to surveys such as the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), the German
Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP), and the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) sometimes do contain employee satisfaction
data, but, naturally, such data is not linked to employer or supervisor data.

(1)

Estimating such a double xed eects model requires sucient variation generated by worker mobility
across supervisors. In our data, workers frequently move between supervisors. In the unbalanced 20042014
panel, the average employee had 3.3 (s.d. of 1.5) dierent supervisors. Only 10% of those observed for at
least 2 years are rated by the same supervisor during their entire time at the rm. Employees who were with
the rm throughout all of 2004-2014 had on average 4.25 dierent supervisors. Similarly, supervisors manage
many dierent employees over time, with some employees joining or leaving their teams almost every year.
The average supervisor manages 10.38 (s.d. of 6.74) employees in a given year and 27 dierent employees
over the full time period they are recorded as supervisors in our data. In fact, the workforce in this rm is
so well connected that the largest connected set covers the entire rm. This rm is thus characterized by
frequent moves between workers and supervisors, helpful for estimating the xed eects that we require (see
Appendix A.3).
Even though supervisor moves are common, the double xed eects specications requires an exogeneity
assumption regarding this mobility. In particular, we are worried that sorting based on time-varying performance might bias our estimates of equation 1. Following Card, Heining, and Kline (2013), we present an event
study of performance for workers who change supervisors (gure 1) to help evaluate whether non-random
sorting is present in our data.
We split the set of supervisors into quartiles based on their average propensity to pass subordinates. We
use pass probability of co-workers (the leave-out mean) to avoid selecting on a worker's own performance. We
then plot average ratings of workers in the two years before and two years after they move across supervisors

18 For simplicity, the gure focuses on people

as a function of origin and destination supervisor category.

leaving quartile 4 supervisors (those with the highest likelihood of passing their subordinates) and quartile
1 supervisors (those with the lowest likelihood).
Figure 1 makes several important points. First, in the two years before moving, workers currently matched
to a high rater have similar (high) performance, regardless of whether they are about to move to a dierent

17 The

controls include for the worker (Xit ) indicators for ve-year age and tenure groups, gender, and job level.

For the

supervisor (Ys(i,t),t ) the controls include indicators for ve-year age groups, gender and job level. We do nd some variation
in average ratings across supervisor characteristics. In particular, older supervisors and supervisors that are higher up the job
hierarchy tend to give higher ratings. We also control for an indicator for whether or not the worker is in a branch network,
and year xed eects. The latter help control for dierences in usage of performance ratings as they become more common in
the rm.

18 There

are about 1,500 to 2,000 worker-year observations in each mobility pair. The pass probabilities used to dene types

of moves and plotted in the gure have been residualized on the same controls specied above, except for the worker and
supervisor xed eects.

high rater or to a lower rater. Similarly, workers matched to a low rater have fairly similar (low) performance
regardless of their destination. This lack of pre-trend in performance alleviates some of the concern about
worker sorting. For instance, we do not observe that workers who are already on a decline move towards
lower raters.
Second, transitioning across supervisor type has important consequences for performance. Workers moving across supervisor type experience large changes in performance, while workers who change supervisors
within quartile experience little change in performance. That is, average ratings fan out for the dierent
types of moves only after the move occurs.
Third, the eects of mobility on performance are symmetric across dierent types of moves and of roughly
similar magnitude. A worker moving from a high to a low rater experiences a sizable drop in pass probability,
while a worker moving from a low to a high rater experiences a sizable increase of comparable magnitude.
The three ndings documented in Figure 1 suggest that the basic specication with additively separable
worker and supervisor eects characterized the data well.
We would now like to estimate the variation in the unobserved eects

from equation 1. However, we run into a well-known incidental parameters

problem. The time dimension of the panel is xed and relatively short (11 years at most) so that we have
only a few observations to estimate each employee and supervisor xed eect  the average supervisor rates
in 3.7 years and the average worker is present in 7.3 years. These xed eects are unbiased but inconsistent
estimates of the unobserved eects. The variance of the xed eects will therefore overstate the variance in
the unobserved eects because it contains an estimation error. Also, the estimation error can be expected

19

to correlate across worker and supervisor eects.

Andrews, Gill, Schank, and Upward (2008) show how to address this problem by adjusting the variancecovariance matrix of the estimated xed eects using the variance-covariance matrix of the estimation error
for these same xed eects. In double-xed eect models, this adjustment will tend to reduce the size of the
estimated variances compared to a naive estimator. The Andrews et al. (2008) approach however requires
that the unobservables are homoskedastic, an assumption that is necessarily violated in our context since
our outcomes are binary.

We follow Kline, Saggio, and Solvsten (2018) to estimate the variation in the

this procedure as the bias-adjusted estimates.

19 This correlated estimation error will likely be negative.

To see this, note that the model is saturated in worker and supervisor

eects so the predicted value from the xed eect regression necessarily goes through the sample mean for each worker and
supervisor. If a worker eect is estimated with positive error, the supervisor eect will tend to be estimated with negative error
to bring the predicted values for observations associated with that worker back through the mean.

20 See

also Card, Heining, and Kline (2013) and Gaure (2014). To arrive at our estimates we rely on the matlab code helpfully

provided by Kline, Saggio, and Solvesten (2018) at https://github.com/rsaggio87/LeaveOutTwoWay.

varies substantially across supervisors.

Using the bias-adjusted moments in column 2, we nd that the variance of

φs

is 0.019. This means that a

one-standard-deviation increase in the supervisor ratings eect amounts to a 13.7 percentage point (30%)
increase in the probability of receiving a passing grade. Thus, a move from the 10th to the 90th percentile
in the distribution of

φs ,

assuming that

φs

is normally distributed, is associated with a 35 percentage point

increase in the probability of receiving a passing grade. The heterogeneity at the worker level is even larger
 a standard deviation increase in

αi

amounts to a 25.9 percentage point increase (56%) in the probability

of receiving a passing grade.
We also nd substantial idiosyncratic variation in ratings, holding constant these xed eects and a rich
set of time-varying controls. This residual variance is an input into the bias adjustment and must also be
adjusted. We use a within-transformation of the error term, demeaning by team (worker-supervisor pairs)
to obtain an unbiased and consistent estimate of this variance. This dierences out unobserved eects that
are not consistently estimated. In practice, this adjustment has only a small eect on our estimate of the
variance in the idiosyncratic component of ratings.
Finally, we estimate the covariance between worker and supervisor eects to be quite small (-0.0093 using
the bias adjustment).

described above, and the rich set of controls also included in the performance regression.
Panel B of Table 3 reports the variation in ratings explained by the dierent components in equation
1. We provide R-squares and F-statistics for: the controls alone, controls plus worker xed eects, controls
plus supervisor xed eects, and the full model. We nd that both sets of xed eects explain a substantial
amount of the variation in ratings.

Given that we have signicantly more worker eects than supervisor

eects, the R-squared with the worker eects (column 2) is quite a bit larger than that with supervisor
eects (column 3). However, the F-statistics show that per xed eect the variation explained by each set is
nearly identical. Furthermore, from column 4, we observe that the F-statistics on the combined restrictions
is nearly identical to those in columns 2 and 3. This means that the variation explained by the two sets of
xed eects is close to orthogonal, which follows from the nding in Panel A that the estimated eects are

21 The

problem for which we need to adjust arises because of estimation error in the xed eects. An ad-hoc, non-technical

approach to this problem is to estimate the variance of the unobserved eects employing only xed eects from workers and
supervisors that we observe a minimum number of times. We implement this approach allowing the minimum cut-o on the
number of observations to increase. As the cut-o increases, we nd that the variances of the xed eects converge towards
those found using the Kline, Saggio, and Solvesten (2008) approach. This increases our condence that the bias-adjustment
succeeds in identifying the actual variation in unobserved eects across workers and supervisors in this rm.

22 Naturally

the covariances between the unobserved eects and the error term are 0.

MODEL

In the previous section, we saw that there is substantial heterogeneity in ratings behavior of supervisors. In
this section, we develop a model with testable predictions that allows us to distinguish between the sources
of ratings heterogeneity and to determine how informed the rm is about such dierences across supervisors.
We allow for two types of heterogeneity.

First, supervisors might dier in terms of their leniency bias:

observing the same performance, some supervisors are simply more inclined to give high ratings than others.
Second, supervisors may dier in managerial ability: some supervisors elicit higher performance from their
workers. These two hypotheses have dierential implications for worker, supervisor, and rm outcomes that
can be tested using our detailed data on subjective and objective performance as well as data on worker and
supervisor career outcomes. See Appendix B for more detail and proofs of the propositions.

sions of heterogeneity across supervisors: (a) heterogeneity in supervisors' abilities

which impacts the

workers' costs of eort, and (b) heterogeneity in the supervisors' willingness to report generously on worker

(βs ).

From now on we suppress individual subscripts unless necessary for clarity. We retain the

supervisor subscripts to indicate that a variable varies across supervisors.

The timing of the model is as follows:

1. Workers and the rm sign contracts that specify the wage function contingent on known supervisor

characteristics.

2. Workers match to supervisors, observe their supervisor's type, exert eort

3. Supervisors observe

summarizes how ratings vary with the supervisor. As discussed above, this variation

can arise either because supervisors dier in their managerial ability

We now consider contracts that specify all payo-relevant aspects of the employment relationship, including the assignment

(µs , βs )

and the mapping of observed ratings to wages. At the contracting stage, agents

(workers, supervisors, and the rm) share information about supervisor types, though this information may
be imperfect.

As is common in the literature, we restrict attention to wage contracts that are linear in the ratings.
Thus, we consider contracts of the form

The parameters

of these wage contracts

are allowed to vary with information on worker and supervisor types available at the contracting stage. The

schemes.
We assume that the rm competes for workers and supervisors in a perfectly competitive market so that
outside options equal expected productivity and compensation is set to make agents indierent across rms.
We assume subordinate ratings do not directly enter into supervisor pay.

25 Eq.

We also retain the index in the discussion of the wage contract that follows to be clear about how individual variation across

27 While

we allow for imperfect information about supervisor type, we assume this information is common to all market

participants so that supervisors are paid their expected marginal product.

This deviates from an important literature on

asymmetric learning whereby the incumbent rm retains an information advantage over competing rms (Greenwald (1986),
Gibbons and Katz (1991), Acemoglu and Pischke (1998), Schonberg (2007), Pinkston (2009), Kahn (2013), Waldman (1984)).
However, in these models, worker pay is still correlated with their ability, so we believe our assumption does not aect the
qualitative implications of the model.

a closely related setting with normal signals and with preferences of the type provided, Holmstrom and Milgrom (1987)

The nding that may be least intuitive is the last part of point 3, which establishes that there is no global

Two countervailing eects bear on

This will lower compensation, since rms will use the intercept of the wage equation to extract all

surplus from employees. On the other hand, the optimal piece rate increases in

µs

and so does the risk borne

by workers. Thus, compensation will have to increase on average to induce workers to bear this risk. When

incentives are low-powered (b

eort cost and total pay increases in

µs .

The opposite is true when incentives are high-powered (b

workers exert a lot of eort. In that case, better managers reduce the eort cost born by workers signicantly
and wages decline with

Proposition 1 states that neither output nor compensation vary with

The intuition is straightforward. Optimal risk sharing induces the rm to remove any source of variation from
employee compensation unless it can be used to incentivize eort. Since

βs

does not enter into the eort cost

function and does not correlate with the signal noise, the rm will neutralize any variation in

βs

when setting

employee compensation. This also implies that eort choice and expected output are independent of

βs .

so the surplus obtained from a given employee does not vary with
does not vary with

βs

Therefore supervisor compensation

are known, the surplus going to the employee does not vary with the

supervisor type since, as we have just noted, worker pay does not vary with

µs

and

either.

We also note that when

A second notable dierence is that the rm is only able to neutralize the variation in

βsE

and

that it is informed

when compensating workers to remove any risk that is not

of use in setting incentives. However, expected compensation will increase with

And, workers earn rents

Finally, expected output does of course still increase in

µs

but not in

βs .

Workers observe a lower cost

of eort, even when the rm only imperfectly observes this, and work harder.

3.4 Leniency Bias vs. Managerial Ability  Perfect vs. Imperfect Information?
Our primary goal is to identify the source of heterogeneity in supervisor ratings,

φs , and whether or not rms

are informed about such heterogeneity. From the ratings equation (6), above, it follows immediately that
panel data on performance ratings alone does not allow to separate heterogeneity in managerial ability and
leniency bias. However, propositions 1 and 2 provide diverging predictions for how output and compensation
vary with

βs

and

µs

for both fully informed and imperfectly informed rms, respectively. These allow us to

identify the sources of heterogeneity and whether the rm is informed or not.
It is useful to consider extreme cases to build intuition about how the fundamentals of the model map
into the data on ratings, compensation, and output.

(θβ = θµ = 1). We also distinguish the


2

case when supervisors dier solely in how lenient they are σβ > 0, σµ = 0 from the case when supervisors


2
2
dier solely in their ability to elicit eort from their team members σβ = 0, σµ > 0 . Table 4 summarizes
informed

(θβ = θµ = 0)

In particular, we contrast rms that are perfectly

with rms that are completely ignorant

these four cases and what they imply for the relationships between supervisor heterogeneity in ratings,
and compensation and productivity.
Table 4 reveals that the data indeed allows us to dierentiate between the four cases.

24

φs ,

To start, we observe that if the rm is informed, then heterogeneity in leniency does not covary with
any of the outcomes we consider (top left quadrant). Compensation contracts in this case are structured to
simply undo the heterogeneity in leniency for both workers and supervisors. Eort is not directly aected
by leniency, and therefore productivity and supervisor earnings are likewise unaected. We also note that
variation in leniency that the rm is uninformed about (bottom left quadrant) does not aect the incentive
component of the contract.

It therefore does not lead to variation in productivity or supervisor earnings

even if the rm is uninformed of it. However, if the rm does not know who the lenient managers are, then
assignment to a lenient manager entails rents to the worker and higher earnings.
By contrast, variation in managerial ability generally leads to increases in productivity. Should the rm
know about the variation in managerial ability across supervisors (top right quadrant), then supervisor wages
and employee piece rates will both increase in the ability of the supervisor, but the worker will not be able
to earn any surplus from this variation in ability. If instead, the rm is uninformed about who the good
supervisors are (bottom right quadrant), then workers earn higher wages and receive rents from working for
better supervisors.
Combined, these diering predictions allow us to test the model and we turn to this task now.

4

TESTING THE MODEL

The model's predictions contingent on the nature of supervisor heterogeneity (ability and leniency) and the
information structure are listed in Table 4. In this section, we empirically evaluate these predictions using
detailed personnel data. Specically, we explore the relationship between supervisor ratings heterogeneity
(estimated in section 2.3) and wages, piece rate strength, objective output (as measured by KPI rankings
and nancial performance), worker surplus (as measured by job stability and bottom-up evaluations), as
well as supervisor pay and mobility outcomes.

4.1 Wages
A key comparative static from Table 4 is the relationship between supervisor ratings heterogeneity (φs ) and
worker wages. We evaluate this relationship using the following model:

log(wit ) = β0 + β1 φs(i,t) + β2 αi + β3 pit + β 0 Xit + γ 0 Ys(i,t)t + νit
where the dependent variable

pit .

We also include the rich set of controls for supervisor and worker

applied when estimating equation 1. These absorb systematic variation in per-

formance and pay that is outside the scope of the model (for example, job function). Finally, we assume
that the error term,

νit ,

is uncorrelated with the variables preceding it.

We use three strategies to estimate the parameters

(β1 , β2 , β3 )

in equation 7 and report these in Table 5.

We rst present results using a naive strategy: simply regress log earnings on the xed eects
obtained from the xed eects specication of equation 1 in Section 2.3.



φ̂s , α̂i , ˆit



We cluster standard errors by

supervisor, the level of variation underlying our main dependent variable. Results are summarized in columns
1-3 of Table 5, labelled OLS.
In column (1) we nd a sizable and statistically signicant relationship between

φs

and log earnings. Our

estimate implies that moving from a supervisor who never passes subordinates to one who passes all of them
increases earnings by about 10 percent. In Section 2.3, we found the bias-adjusted standard deviation of

φs

to be 0.137. Thus, a move from a 10th percentile rater to one at the 90th percentile of

φs

is associated

with an increase in earnings of about 3.3 percent. We also nd that worker eects correlate positively with
earnings. A one-standard-deviation higher

α

is associated with earnings increases of 2.6 percent. Finally,

having an idiosyncratically high rating in the current period () gives workers a positive but modest earnings
boost.

30

In column (2) we add business unit xed eects as additional controls.

One may be worried that

dierences across units due to, say, size or client base give rise to a positive correlation between ratings and
earnings. We do not have enough mobility of supervisors across business units to separately identify unit
xed eects from supervisor xed eects in ratings.

However, including business unit xed eects in the

earnings regression takes the conservative approach of assigning any common component in ratings to the
unit itself, and not, say, to unusually better or worse idiosyncratic supervisors or workers. The coecient
on

φs

falls by about half with the inclusion of this control, but remains signicant at the one percent level.

This specication also helps rule out a reverse causality story: that business units that tend to receive large
salary pools must give out high ratings to rationalize spending of the salary pool. The fact that our results

31

hold within branch xed eects suggests this is not the case.

Up to this point, we have leveraged worker switches across supervisors to estimate supervisor heterogeneity in performance ratings (section 2.3), but we are not explicitly using this variation to understand
the impact of such heterogeneity on worker earnings. The worker xed eects specication in column (3)

level drive our results.

26

identies the coecient on

φ explicitly from workers who switch supervisors.

Here we nd the point estimate

is quite a bit attenuated, to 0.025, but still signicant at the one percent level. This attenuation is partly
because we must identify over 14,000 worker xed eects, which absorbs quite a lot of the variation in log
earnings. But also, eects in columns 1 and 2 might indeed be at least in part driven by sorting as opposed
to causal eects of supervisors. However, even here, a move from a 10th to 90th percentile rater is associated
with an earnings increase of about 0.9 percent.

That is non-trivial and, as we discuss in section 5, can

32

compound over time.

Another way to see the eect of switching supervisors is with an event-style analysis, summarized in gure

φ

2. Here we regress log(earnings) on the change in

associated with the supervisor switch interacted with

indicators for event time before or after the switch. The omitted category is the year before the supervisor
switch. Regressions also control for worker xed eects and typical controls. We nd that the impact of

φ

a change in

becomes apparent only after the worker actually makes the switch and impacts earnings at

about the magnitude of column 3 in table 5.
The naive estimator in columns 1-3 has the virtue of being extremely transparent, but unfortunately is
biased for the reasons discussed before: the worker and supervisor xed eects in ratings are contaminated by
correlated measurement error. Our second strategy is therefore to pursue an instrumental variables approach.
We split the sample into two separate periods and obtain two distinct sets of estimates for

α0 s

and

φ0 s,

one

from each subsample. These two sets of xed eects will be highly correlated because they are estimates
of the same underlying unobserved eects. At the same time, the estimation errors across the two sets of
estimates are uncorrelated. We can thus correct for the incidental parameter problem by instrumenting xed
eects estimated from one subsample with the xed eects from the other subsample, and vice versa.
Our preferred way of splitting the sample is by even and odd years because it maximizes the overlap

β1

and

β2 .

However, we cannot estimate

β3 ,

the coecient on the ratings residual. The reason is that the

error term from one subsample is uncorrelated with the unobserved eects (α and

32 In

φ)

in that subsample as

Appendix A.3, we present estimates using only individuals after they have had a supervisor switch and restrict even

further to specic supervisor moves that are plausibly more exogenous. Rather than leveraging the change in outcomes as a
function of the change in
allocation of

φ

φ, as in the worker xed eects specications, this strategy explores the eect of a plausibly exogenously

on worker outcomes. Our results (see Table A4) are consistent across such moves. Most notably, we nd very

similar results when we restrict ourselves to individuals assigned to a new supervisor whose supervisor in the previous period
left the rm.

33 We

have experimented with splitting the sample in other ways  for instance, into an early and late period (pre- and

post-2009). The results are fully consistent with those reported here but typically the overlap in the samples is much smaller
and the estimates are therefore noisier.

34 The

rst stage regressions, using

α's

and

φ's

estimated on odd years to predict those estimated on even years and vice

versa, are highly predictive. The F-statistic on the instruments is 186 for predicting

27

φ

and 3,572 for predicting

α.

Our third strategy is to expand the Andrews et al. (2008) correction  our conceptual framework for
obtaining bias-adjusted estimates of variances in ratings components (section 2.3)  to a joint system of two

of the unobserved eects are obtained they can be transformed into implied regression coecients. Results
are reported in columns 5-6 of Table 5. This estimator is computationally intensive and we therefore only
implement it for worker earnings (and not the other dependent variables explored below). The methodology
also requires strong distributional assumptions regarding the error terms that are not immediately applicable
for some of our outcome variables such as those aggregated to the supervisor or branch level. However, this
methodology does have the advantage that it can be applied to almost the entire estimation sample, not only
the one consisting of workers and supervisors present in both even and odd years. It only requires that we be

36

able to estimate worker and supervisor xed eects in log(earnings), which applies for 77,583 observations.

Across all specications, we nd that working for a high-rating supervisor is associated with substantially
higher earnings. The unadjusted estimates are a bit smaller in magnitude, compared to the split sample IV
and bias corrections, as we would expect if the estimation error is interpreted as measurement error. Recall
from Table 4 that these results are consistent with either heterogeneity being driven primarily by supervisor
ability, or by supervisor leniency if rms are uninformed about supervisor heterogeneity. By contrast, the
informed rm would undo any variation driven by leniency in compensation. Our ndings in Table 5 thus
reject the joint hypothesis that (1) the heterogeneity in ratings across supervisors is driven by leniency bias
and (2) the rm is informed about this heterogeneity.

4.2 Piece Rates
A key dierence between high-ability supervisors and lenient supervisors in our model is that high-ability
supervisors lower the marginal cost of eort for workers. Consequently, informed rms will raise piece rates
for subordinates who are matched to better managers while piece rates will not vary across supervisors
that dier only in their leniency bias. Hence, one way to disentangle supervisor ability from leniency is to

35 We

have not succeeded in adapting Kline, Saggio, and Solvsten (2018) to the two-equation setting and thus rely on Andrews

et al. (2008). For ratings, adjusted estimates are very similar using either the Andrews et al. or the Kline et al. approach.

36 Recall,

our estimation sample is already restricted to observations for whom we can identify supervisor and worker xed

eects in ratings. However, earnings data are not available in our last year of data, and this restriction results in the loss of
identication for a small number of worker and supervisor xed eects.

determine if variable pay components are sensitive to supervisor heterogeneity.
To shed light on this relationship, we augment our earnings regression 7 by interacting supervisor heterogeneity

(φs )

with performance

(pass)

in a given period. The interaction measures whether performance

ratings have a stronger eect on earnings when the supervisor is a higher rater. We also take a more direct
approach and use as dependent variables the probability of receiving a bonus and the log of the size of the
bonus, conditional on receiving one. For these models we only present OLS results because we do not know
how to adapt the split-sample IV and or the bias correction method to identify the coecient on

φ ∗ pass.

Table 6 contains the results.
We nd that total earnings and bonuses, conditional on receiving one, are more strongly related to the
worker's performance when assigned to a high rater. All else equal, passing the performance review is worth
an additional 7 percent in wages when working for a high rater (the coecient 0.075 on

φ ∗ P ass

in column

1). The main eect of passing the performance review can be obtained by summing coecients on all the
components: 0.20 (=

0.067 + 0.108 + 0.031).

of pay for performance by about a third.
between

φ

Therefore, matching with a high rater increases the strength

The magnitudes on both the main eects and the interaction

and pass fall with the inclusion of business unit xed eects in column 2 or worker xed eects

in column 3, but the story is still qualitatively similar: workers earn an extra 2-3 percent when they pass
their performance review if they also work with a higher rater, or about 20 to 50 percent of the main eect
of passing (the sum of the coecients on

φ, α,

and

).

Thus the dierence in incentive strength across raters

is primarily not due to dierences across units in general performance, norms, or job functions and holds up
to variation that explicitly takes advantage of supervisor switches. From columns 4-9, much of the eect is
due to the size of the bonus, conditional on receiving one. This is consistent with our understanding that
supervisors have discretion over allocating salaries, but especially bonuses.

30

These ndings are consistent with the hypothesis that supervisor heterogeneity is driven by heterogeneity
in managerial ability that the rm is informed about.

4.3 Productivity
As pointed out above, our model implies that more able supervisors lower the marginal cost of eort and raise
productivity. In contrast, lenient supervisors do not alter productivity. These associations hold irrespective
of whether the rm is informed about supervisor heterogeneities. Hence, as long as we have an independent
measure of productivity (separate from performance ratings), we can use the correlation between supervisor
heterogeneity and productivity to disentangle supervisor ability from leniency.
We have access to two such measures of objective performance. During the years 20072010 the company
ranked branches within a set of peers along a number of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that reect

37 For the years 2014 and 2015 we have information on individual

nancial outcomes, customer relations, etc.

nancial performance. This latter metric is available for about half of the workers in the branches, primarily
among senior workers with client facing roles.

For both KPI performance and nancial performance we

investigate their relation to worker and supervisor xed eects using OLS and our split-sample IV approach.
For power reasons, we use xed eects estimated on the sample as a whole, not the restricted sample where
objective performance measures are available. For the nancial performance regressions, it is worth noting
that our personnel records end in 2014, while the nancial performance measure covers the years 2014 and
2015. Hence, in practice, we regress our nancial performance measures on the xed eects associated with

38

the supervisor the employee was assigned to in 2014 , and, as usual, cluster standard errors by supervisor.

Table 7 presents the OLS (Panel A) and the split-sample IV (Panel B) estimates for both sets of measures.
The KPI regressions (columns 14) relate the branch rankings to averages of employee and supervisor xed

37 We

have reestimated all results presented in this paper on the subsample restricted to branches and years where KPIs are

available, and found them to generally be quite robust to this sample restriction.

38 This

is likely to induce some downward bias because supervisors change over time. The degree of downward bias will depend

on how persistent

there is only one supervisor in a given branch-year, as is often the case, the average supervisor eect is the ratings eect

for that supervisor. In cases where there is more than one rater, the average supervisor xed eect is obtained by averaging
across supervisors, weighted by the number of subordinates each rated this period.

40 The

rst-stage of the IV is naturally estimated on the same sample and at the same level as the second-stage: branch-years

for branches with KPI data.

41 These include year eects,

the average worker age, tenure, and share female, as well as the average of each job-level indicator.

specications to account for dierent patterns in productivity based on local demand, the client base, etc...

themselves control for baseline heterogeneity since KPI rankings are relative to a peer group of branches that
the rm denes, and nancial performance is the individual's year-over-year growth rate in their portfolio.
Our general nding from Table 7 is a positive relationship between higher rating supervisors and objective
performance of subordinates and branches. We explore a range of functional forms for the KPI rankings.
Using our IV estimates, we nd that a branch with a one-standard-deviation higher

φ

has a 0.05 higher

inverse rank score (−1 times the branch's ranking divided by the number of branches in the peer group), or 9
percent, is 1.9 percentage points (31 percent) more likely to be the top-ranked branch, is 6 percentage points
(20 percent) more likely to be ranked among the top 5 branches in the peer group, and 6.4 percentage points
(13 percent) more likely to be ranked in the top half. These magnitudes are economically large. We also
nd positive eects for individual nancial performance. IV estimate implies that a one-standard-deviation
higher rating supervisor is associated with a 1 percentage point (13 percent) larger growth rate.
The results in Table 7 indicate a positive relationship between supervisor heterogeneity and performance.
Unfortunately, we only have performance measures for a small number of years and branches, which at
times challenges the statistical signicance of the point estimates.

The evidence we do provide, however,

suggests that there is a positive relation between supervisors ratings heterogeneity and team performance.
This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that we have two distinct performance measures that occur at
dierent points in time. Hence, our results support the hypothesis that manager ability (µs ), rather than

43

leniency bias (βs ), drives supervisor heterogeneity.

4.4 Supervisor Outcomes

Only if supervisor heterogeneity reects

and supervisor compensation correlate positively.

To investigate this relationship we regress supervisor outcomes on their own ratings xed eect, as well

42 Similarly

the table does not include worker xed eects specications. These are not apt for the KPI regressions that are

aggregated to the branch-year level, and, with only two years of individual nancial performance data, we do not allow enough
variation for identifying worker xed eects in column 5.

43 The

estimated impacts of

α

on objective performance in Table 7 are statistically insignicant. However, the 95 percent

condence intervals for the point estimates typically include large positive eects. The results are thus consistent with worker
quality that correlates positively with branch performance, though too noisy to be conclusive.

Notes: Columns 1-4 are estimated using data from 2007-2010 at at the branch-year level; performance components are the branch-year averages. Column 5 is estimated
using worker-level data on a subset of employees for years 2014-15. Here, the performance components are also at the individual level. Inverse rank score is -1 times the
branch's KPI ranking in that year divided by the number of branches it is ranked against. In Panel B, we estimate supervisor and worker fixed effects on odd and even
years separately. We instrument for the branch-year averages in odd years with those obtained in even years and vice versa. Regressions include controls for branch
size. Column 5 includes all controls listed in table 3. Columns 1-4 include year effects, branch size, and the branch-year averages of worker age, tenure, share female,
and job level dummies. Significance levels are represented using stars: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

the average characteristics of the group of workers being supervised, as well as branch size. Standard errors
are clustered by supervisor.
Results are reported in Table 8. Supervisor earnings are strongly positively correlated with their own
ratings style (as well as the quality of the team they supervise). This is true for log earnings overall and
for the size of the bonus conditional on receiving one. For example, using the IV estimates, we nd that
supervisor earnings increase by 2 percent for each standard deviation in

φs .

Much of this increase comes

through an increase in the size of the bonus received, conditional on receiving one. Furthermore, supervisors
who are high raters are substantially more likely to pass the performance review they receive from their
own supervisor. A one-standard deviation higher rater is 6 percentage points more likely to pass their own
performance review.
Supervisor earnings also positively correlate with the quality of the team they supervise,

α.

This result

is intriguing, even though our model cannot rationalize it. One possibility is that perhaps the rm cannot
perfectly separate the ability of supervisors from the ability of workers.
We nd little evidence that ratings heterogeneity correlates with mobility in either direction. The point
estimates on promotion probability are positive and large, but those on staying with the rm or in the
business unit are negative. Standard errors related to these outcomes are simply too large to say anything
denitive.
Consistent with our earlier ndings, the positive relationship between supervisor ratings behavior and
their own compensation and ratings provides support for the hypothesis that supervisor heterogeneity reects
ability dierences that the rm is informed about rather than dierences in leniency.

4.5 Worker Surplus and the Information Structure
The last comparative static we consider is whether worker surplus is related to supervisor heterogeneity.
This relationship is particularly informative about the information structure. In our model, fully informed
rms will always hold workers to their participation constraint, eliminating any variation in surplus resulting
from supervisor characteristics. Evidence that worker surplus increases in supervisor heterogeneity indicates
that the rm is not fully informed about dierences across supervisors in

φs .

We use worker mobility and worker satisfaction surveys to look for evidence regarding rents associated

44 As

in the branch-year regressions of table 7, we include branch size but not branch or worker xed eects.

For the IV

specications, we obtain supervisor and worker xed eects for the full odd- and even-year samples. We then instrument for
supervisor eects and the average worker eect to a given supervisor in a given year using the estimates from the opposite
subsample.

Notes: Observations are at the supervisor-year level. φ is how the supervisor rates their own subordinates, and α and ε are the averages of the subordinates rated that year. In Panel
B, we estimate supervisor and worker fixed effects on odd and even years separately. We instrument for the supervisor effect and supervisor-year-level average worker effects in odd
years with those obtained in even years and vice versa. Outcomes are supervisor pay, performance, and mobility variables in the given year. Pass is whether the supervisor passed
their own performance review; promotion probability is restricted to observations that did not leave the firm in the next year. Controls are listed in table 3; worker controls are the
average for characteristics. We also include the average branch size of subordinates rated in the given year in all specifications. Significance levels are represented using stars: ***

φs .

Worker satisfaction surveys provide direct evidence on how workers perceive their supervisors.

These surveys are taken by an independent consulting rm and anonymized before being returned to the
rm, which should encourage workers to report their answers truthfully. Fortunately for us, we have access to
the survey responses prior to anonymization. For the other outcomes, workers can, to some extent, inuence
their assignments across units within the rm, and can likely control whether they stay with the rm.
Table 9 presents OLS (panel A) and split-sample IV estimates (panel B). For each outcome we present
our base-line specication as well asseparate specications with branch and worker xed eects. The latter
leverages only worker switches for identifying the coecient on

φ.

It turns out that the results are robust

across these specications, but we should note that estimates become unstable and imprecisely estimated
when we use the supervisor leave-out mean in performance ratings as the key regressor.
Column 1 shows that workers are more likely to stay in the rm in the next year if working for a

in magnitude and signicance when we add business unit xed eects in column 2 or worker xed eects
in column 3.

Columns 4-6 show that workers are more likely to stay in the same business unit in the

next year when assigned to a higher rater. In columns 7-9, workers are not any more likely to stay with
their particular supervisor, though, as we have noted, many supervisor switches are driven by moves of the
supervisors themselves, which would be outside the control of the worker.
Finally, the results in columns 10-12 are based on data from the employee job satisfaction survey. The
dependent variable is the average across seven survey questions relating to the supervisor, normed to have a
standard deviation of 1. The results show that subordinates tend to be more satised with their supervisors
when their supervisors are higher raters. While this eect is statistically signicant, its economic importance
is modest as an assignment to a one-standard-deviation higher rater is associated with a modest 0.034
increase in the bottom-up rating a worker ascribes to his or her supervisor (the mean of that variable is 4.7).
The magnitude is fairly similar in the worker xed eects specication, which explicitly leverages supervisor
switches and also controls for dierences in average ratings behavior across workers.
Together, these ndings indicate that workers earn rents when assigned to high rating supervisors, even
though it is dicult to ascertain the magnitude of these rents. Nevertheless, while the evidence presented
so far suggests that supervisor heterogeneity reects ability dierences that the rm is informed about, the

46

results in Table 9 suggest that the rm is not perfectly informed about such dierences.

If the rm is unable to perfectly distinguish between worker and supervisor eects, it may still learn

45 We

have estimated the probabilities of quit and layo separately and nd that being matched to a higher rater has similar

negative impacts on both, though estimates are noisier than the combined probability shown in the table.

46 Table

9 also reveals that workers with higher

α

may earn rents; they are less likely quit, more likely to stay with their

current supervisor, and report being more satised at their job.

over time. In that case, benets accruing to a worker who is matched to a high rater should attenuate with
supervisor tenure. We explore this in Table 10. We specify tenure as the number of years the supervisor has
been rating subordinates. We augment our main specication (equation 7) to include an interaction between

φ

and an indicator equaling 1 if the supervisor has above median tenure, dened as the length of time they

47

have been rating subordinates.

Beginning with log(earnings) in columns 1, we consistently nd that the benet of a high rating supervisor
on worker earnings is smaller when the supervisor has more tenure. Magnitudes are especially large for the

split-sample IV, where we nd that osets are about half to three-quarters of the main eect.

the remaining variables are noisy. However, the mobility variables (stay in rm, stay in unit, and stay with
supervisor) all have the opposite sign of the main eect

φ,

and magnitudes are sizable. This is suggestive of

the same attenuation as seen in earnings, but of course not conclusive.
Overall, Table 10 provides suggestive evidence that the benets workers experience when associated with
a high rater are indeed partially undone for supervisors with more tenure. This is consistent with the idea
that there are rents associated with being matched to certain supervisors, but that these rents are driven by
imperfect information. However, the bottom-up evaluations indicate that subordinates still enjoy working
for a better manager, even if they accrue fewer economic rents. Of course the evidence is far from conclusive,
given the large standard errors.

47 We

also include the main eect for the supervisor tenure variable, which is essentially subsumed in our controls. We have

explored a range of dierent functional forms, all yielding consistent results. We also nd similar results when dening tenure
as the overall length of time the supervisor has been with the rm.

length of time the supervisor has been giving ratings is above median. We also include the main effect of the supervisor tenure variables, which are essentially subsumed
in our other controls. All regressions include time‐varying worker and supervisor controls (see Table3). Standard errors clustered by supervisor. Significance levels are

4.6 Discussion
We have presented results on how the heterogeneity in ratings associated with supervisors

φs

relates to

outcomes for employees, supervisors, and the rm. We found that (1) individual earnings increase with
(2) piece rates increase in

φs

φs ,

φs , (3) team productivity as measured by the KPI ranking increases in the average

within a branch, (4) individual nancial performance increases in

φs ,

(5) supervisor pay increases in

φs ,

and (6) workers appear to earn (moderate) rents from being matched to higher raters, that are attenuated
for raters with longer tenures about whom the rm is presumably more informed.

These ndings speak

to the nature of the heterogeneity associate with supervisors and whether the rm is informed about this
heterogeneity. Consulting Table 4, our evidence suggests that supervisor heterogeneity in ratings is driven
mainly by dierences in managerial ability and that the rm is partially informed about this heterogeneity.
There are three pieces of evidence that support the interpretation that heterogeneity in managerial ability
drives at least some of the variation in ratings across supervisors. First, we nd that objective performance
increases when individuals or teams are managed by a high rater (Table 7), which directly supports the
managerial ability hypothesis.

Second, high-rating supervisors earn signicantly higher salaries (Table 8)

suggesting that rms value them, as would be the case when high raters are also better managers. Third,
subordinates of higher raters tend to face stronger incentives (Table 6), which is rationalized in our model
by the fact that better managers lower the marginal cost of worker eort (an equivalent assumption is that
better managers increase output per additional unit of eort).
The observation that the strength of incentives for employees and that average compensation of supervisors vary with

φs

suggests that the rm is informed about the heterogeneity in ratings styles across

supervisors. However, it seems a priori plausible that rms will not be perfectly informed. This notion is
consistent with the observation that subordinates earn (moderate) economic rents when working for higher
rating supervisors.

The perfectly informed rm would extract all rents from its employees by adjusting

their base salaries to place them on their participation constraints, and we do see evidence consistent with
this behavior for supervisors with longer tenures. The rm also appears to reward supervisors for the xed
quality of their subordinates (Table 8), which may also be indicative of a lack of ability to perfectly discern
what drives performance.
Of course, outside our model there are other reasons why rms might share rents with higher raters or
with employees.

This rm may purposely do a better job fostering a feeling of satisfaction for desirable

workers and supervisor-worker matches.
Finally, while these results have a clear interpretation within the context of our model, one could write
down other models of compensation and bonuses that might generate similar predictions. Regardless of the

39

model used to interpret these results, we have shown that there is substantial heterogeneity in performance
ratings across supervisors and that this heterogeneity is indeed associated with heterogeneity in objective
output.

Firms should therefore think twice before imposing forced curves or other rules that limit the

variation in subjective performance ratings as it may undermine supervisors' ability to manage.

HOW INFLUENTIAL ARE HIGH RATERS FOR CAREERS?

In Section 4.1, we established that working for a high-rating supervisor is associated with higher contemporaneous earnings. Next, we consider how longer-term career outcomes vary with supervisor type. This requires
us to think about dynamic eects in relation to

φs

and thus forces us to step outside of the static model

presented in Section 3. In particular, we are interested in how ratings aect earnings in subsequent years,
even after a worker has left the high-rating supervisor. This could manifest because pay raises are persistent
but also because high-rating supervisors may aect the progression of a worker along the job hierarchy.
We begin by estimating the persistence of

φs

on pay. We base our estimates on the following dynamic

equation relating current log earnings to several lagged supervisor eects:


w l, φt , et = g1 (lit ) + h1 (Xi,t ) + Σkτ=0 βτ φs(i,t−τ ) + Σkτ=0 θτ εi,t−τ + ei,t

for two reasons. First, we control for job-level eects

to account for any variation in ratings style across job levels.

However, part of the eect of ratings

heterogeneity on future earnings arises through promotions and we will explore that eect below. Second,
we control for ratings type of supervisors in other periods. This removes any eect of the current supervisor

naturally begins to drop. To understand any dierences across samples, column 2 shows the main earnings

Notes: The table reports regressions of log earnings on contemporanous supervisor effects (φ), worker
unobserved effects (α), and residuals (ε) from the ratings equation (1). Lag 1 φ is the φ associated with the
supervisor the worker was matched to in t‐1. Lag 2 φ is for t‐2, etc. All regressions contain the same number of
lags in (ε) as in (φ) and control for the same set of controls as in the main specification reported in table 5.

Column 3 presents results including all four lags of supervisor eects. The coecient on the contemporaneous earnings eect drops to

0.029.

This is because part of the supervisor eect on earnings comes through

persistence of supervisors across periods (as shown at least qualitatively in Table 9). Furthermore, we nd
that impacts of supervisor's

φ

on pay are quite persistent. The coecients on the lagged

φ

range between

0.014 and 0.021. This suggests that roughly half to two-thirds of the contemporaneous pay increase associated with having a high-rating supervisor persists several periods later. While the eect of being assigned
to a higher rater is somewhat transitory, the large fraction that remains could indicate direct salary impacts

CONCLUSION

In this paper we provide evidence that supervisors dier widely in their ratings behavior. A worker matched
to a one standard deviation higher rater is 13.7 percentage points (30 percent) more likely to receive a passing
score (a performance score in the upper half of the performance scale). To understand this variation, we
provide a theoretical framework that allows for two sources of heterogeneity in ratings behavior: leniency
bias and managerial ability. We also allow the degree to which rms are informed about the heterogeneity
to vary.
Within the context of this model, we conclude that dierences in managerial ability are an important

54 This conclusion is based on the empirical

component of the heterogeneity in supervisors' ratings behavior.

nding that worker pay, pay for performance, supervisor pay, and individual and team-level objective performance measures are all increasing in the supervisor's propensity to give passing ratings to subordinates.
Workers also appear to enjoy working with higher raters since they are less likely to voluntarily move away
from them (by quitting or switching supervisors) and give them better ratings on bottom-up evaluations.
This suggests that rms are unable to fully extract the surplus produced in the match between a worker
and a high-rating supervisor, possibly because they are not fully informed about the heterogeneity in supervisor's ratings behavior. Consistent with the latter, we nd that this surplus is attenuated for supervisors
with higher tenure, about whom the rm is presumably more informed.
These results all have a clear interpretation within the context of our model. However, one could develop
other models of compensation and bonuses that would generate the same predictions. For example, if bonuses
are distributed based on a threshold rule, rather than linearly, a lenient supervisor will cause workers to exert
more eort if they are close to the threshold margin. Or, supervisors may dier in their propensity to make
subordinate pay vary with performance; those applying stronger incentives should get more output out of

their workers and give them higher ratings. We do not know enough about how bonuses are set inside this
rm to speak to these hypotheses. It may also be that a lenient supervisor generates a warm glow among
his or her team that in and of itself generates higher output. Disentangling these and other stories is beyond
the scope of this paper. Instead, our goals have been to (1) highlight the surprising and sizable variation
in ratings across supervisors, and, (2) disciplining ourselves to one plausible model, which allowed us to
dig deeper into the nature and information structure of this heterogeneity. Regardless of our model we can
conclude that heterogeneity in ratings is indeed reected in objective output measures suggesting that how
supervisors rate and manage their employees interact in important ways.
Subjective performance reviews are controversial because workers may worry they are vulnerable to
managerial biases.

As a result, rms may desire to impose rules designed to correct for biases.

might, for instance, force supervisors to grade their employees on a curve.

They

However, our work cautions

against such practices. At the rm we study, supervisor heterogeneity in ratings reects, at least in part,
real dierences in the ability to elicit output from subordinates.

Hence, rms should exercise care when

they consider introducing forced curves or other guidelines restricting supervisors in how they can rate their
subordinates.

Data Appendix

A.1 Firm Structure
The rm consists of an extensive branch network, as well as a central corporate oce. We take advantage
of both.
Figure A1 depicts the ow of employees between the branch network and the central oce as well as ows
for employees entering and exiting the rm. Churn is fairly low at this rm: about 10 percent of employment
at the central oce enters and exits each year, while roughly 6 percent of employment in the branch network
enters and exits. There is also some movement between the branch network and the central oce.
Table A1 provides summary statistics separately for the branches and the central function. Salaries are
on average higher for employees in central functions. This is especially true for the bonus pool which is much
larger for workers in the central functions. Other variables are fairly similar across the two samples, though
we do not have KPI ratings or nancial performance for workers in the central oce.
Figure A2 provides some detail on the ows across dierent job levels in the rm.

There is plenty of

mobility up the hierarchy of the rm, and less mobility down, consistent with other personnel datasets
(Baker, Gibbs, and Holmstrom 1994a and 1994b). Workers enter and exit from all levels of the hierarchy,
though the lowest levels have much more churn.
Figure A3 zooms in on the branch network and provides both these same ows across job levels within
the branch system, and also describes how workers move between the branches and the central corporate
oce. Promotion and demotion rates are relatively similar within the branch system, compared to the rm
as a whole. There is also a modest amount of movement to and from the central oce (bottom arrows at
each level).

A.2 Data Construction
Performance reviews take place in March of a given year, and are meant to evaluate performance over
the preceding 12 months.

We associate performance in a given period with earnings over the 12 months

immediately following that period.

For example, performance in 2012 is the review corresponding to the

period April 2011-March 2012, and earnings in 2012 are the sum of earnings from April 2012 to March
2013. This implies that in the last sample year (2014) we observe performance data but not compensation
measures.
In the performance management system, we begin with a sample of 153,984 employee-year observations.
After dropping 5,677 observations for which we lack basic control variables we retain 148,107 employee-year

50

observations from roughly 24,000 unique workers. Next, we drop 24,055 observations that are part-time and
3,068 employees that are low-level sta such as cleaners or apprentices.

From there, 32,554 observations

lack a performance measure. As noted in the text, this is largely because the performance system took a
few years to be fully rolled out.

In 2004, 43 percent of the sample received performance ratings but the

system spread rapidly; by 2008, 83 percent of the employees were covered. The coverage stayed at that level
or slightly above throughout the remainder of the sample period.

The next most important reason why

observations lack performance ratings is in their rst and last year at the rm employees are less likely to

56 Dropping those without a performance measure leaves

be present during the performance review period.
us with 88,430 observations.

In Section 2.3, we described the double xed eects regression used to understand heterogeneity across
supervisors and employees in the performance ratings that they give and receive, respectively. To create our
estimation sample, we drop 3,161 observations for whom we cannot econometrically identify their employee
xed eect or associated supervisor xed eect. The bulk of these dropped observations (2,765) come from
employees who are only in the rm for a single year and thus the employee xed eect absorbs the entire
variation. The other 396 observations are dropped because some supervisors do not have enough variation
once worker xed eects, supervisor controls, and worker controls are included in the empirical specication.
These restrictions result in an estimation sample of 85,269 worker-year observations, corresponding to
57.6 percent of the full data set and 70.5 percent of the full-time sample.

Within this sample, we have

77,682 observations with a compensation measure  in our last year of data, 2014, we have only performance
measures and not yet a full year of compensation data.

A.3 Worker mobility
For identifying supervisor and worker xed eects it ratings, we require that the temporary variation of
performance is exogenous to the matching of workers to supervisors.

This is more likely to be the case

if there is no explicit process in place matching workers at particular junctions of their careers to specic
supervisors.

It is also more likely the case if there is a lot of mobility of workers and supervisors in the

rm that is unrelated to individual variation in performance. From conversations with the rm, we know
that there is no xed procedure matching workers to supervisors nor are there any a priori reasons why
temporarily low (or high)-performing workers might be matched with specic supervisors. In addition, we
note that moves across supervisors are very common in this rm. In this subsection, we describe this mobility
in more detail.

56 There

is some systematic variation in who receives ratings in that more stable workers (e.g., those with higher tenure and

those outside of the lower job levels) are more likely to be rated. However, once the system becomes stable in 2008, observables
such as tenure or job level have very little power in predicting whether an individual will be missing a performance rating.

51

Table A2 describes employee moves in the rm conditional on being observed in adjacent periods (t and

t + 1).

57 Column 2 gives

Column 1 gives the distribution of moves across job levels and business units.

the probability that workers with a given type of move (dened by the row) changed supervisors. Columns
3-5 restrict to observations where a supervisor switch actually occurs. Column 3 gives the distribution of
supervisor switches across worker transition type. Column 4 gives the average change in
eect) upon supervisor switch, while column 5 gives the average change in



φ (supervisor ratings

(the transitory component of

ratings), conditional on the type of worker transition dened in the row.
The rst thing to note is that, even while 77% of workers remain in the same position, the remainder
move across job levels and/or business units. Further, such moves typically entail a supervisor switch. For
instance, 66% of workers making a lateral move to another business unit switch supervisors as well. If they
are also promoted, then they switch supervisors 85% of the time. Even for workers who do not move job
levels or business units, we observe that supervisor switches are relatively common (30%).

Because the

majority of individuals remain at their position in any given year, supervisor switchers are much more likely
to come from this group (64%, column 3). The next table explores these changes, showing they are primarily
driven by dierent types of supervisor moves.
The remaining columns of Table A2 describe the change in performance components following a supervisor
switch. In column 4, we show that workers do not face a systematic change in

φ when switching supervisors.

The average change overall (bottom row) of -0.006 is only 4 percent of a standard deviation in

φ

(see Table

3). This, to some extent, helps to allay concerns about endogenous sorting. If workers seek supervisors based
on their ratings behavior, we would expect to see more systematic changes in
changes in

,

φ.

The nal column explores

the transient component of performance ratings. If the rm sorted workers to new supervisors

at a moment when they expected the worker's performance to change, that should show up in the epsilon.
Yet, for the most part, we see only small magnitudes here, especially compared to the standard deviation
of

,

0.35. The one exception is we see negative eects for workers newly promoted. This is consistent with

some regression to the mean after an unusually positive performance generated a promotion.
Table A3 narrows in on the group of workers who remain in the same business unit and job level but still
switch supervisors. In this table, we describe the destination of the outgoing supervisor and the change in
performance components following the switch. Conditional on employees remaining in the same position in
the rm, many supervisor switches are due to variation in the position of the supervisors. That is, for half of
these switches (one minus 0.48 in the 6th row, column 1), the old supervisor leaves their current situation.
These moves are primarily driven by supervisors exiting the sample (23 percent), but also come from lateral
moves to other business units (12 percent), and internal promotions (8 percent). Smaller fractions of outgoing

57 We

dene a business unit move as a move to another branch or to another function within corporate.

52

supervisors are demoted or promoted across business units. Again for most of these moves the changes in
and



φ

58

are small in magnitude.

The table probably understates the rm's need to make reassignments following such moves because
there might be ripple eects within a unit. For example, someone leaving the business unit might necessitate
reorganizing all the teams within.
The general message of Tables A2 and A3 is that movement of employees and supervisors across job
levels and across business units constantly requires reshuing of teams and supervisory relationships. The
frequency of this reassignment should alleviate concerns that endogenous mobility threatens our inference.
We can take this a step further by focusing on moves that are more plausibly unrelated to worker trends in
performance. In Table A4, we present log(earnings) results, akin to those in Table 5, restricting the sample
to those associated with various supervisor switches.

Column 1 reproduces the baseline model relating

log(earnings) to ratings components (column 1 of Table 5). Column 2 restricts the sample to observations
immediately following a supervisor switch and the worker stays put (the sample in Table A3). Column 3
further restricts to situations where the supervisor switched because of a move across levels, units or exit.
Finally, column 4 is restricted to a sample of supervisor exits. Reassuringly, we nd fairly similar results
across these subsamples, chosen so that the supervisor switch is, as best we can tell, outside the control of
the worker.

58 For

supervisor demotions within the same business unit, subordinates experience a relatively large increase in



of 0.063.

This again could be regression to the mean, as a supervisor may have been demoted for unusually bad team performance.

Model Details

This appendix lls in details related to the model. We restate some of the material developed in the paper
itself.

Many results follow immediately from known results in the literature (see for example Holmstrom

[1979]) and in those cases we do not present detailed derivations.

and reduce the marginal cost of eort.

Having observed

q,

supervisors report a rating

r

to the rm. Supervisors trade o the conicting goals of

being lenient and reporting truthfully on their employee's productivity. We embed this trade-o in
supervisor preferences in equation 12:

u(ws , q, r) = ws + β̃s (r − q) −

Supervisors will choose

(r − q)

(12)

to maximize their utility, resulting in the following reporting function:

r=q+

β˜s
γ˜s

= q + βs .

(13)

The timing of the model is as follows:

1. Workers and rms sign contracts that specify the known characteristics of the supervisors that workers

54

are assigned to and the linear wage function.

wi,s = ai,s + bi,s ri

. Here we explicitly index the contract

terms with both i and s, since they can depend on both the worker and the supervisor.

2. Workers meet with the supervisors they are assigned to, exert eort

e,

and produce

q.

(a) When we allow for incomplete information about supervisor types at the contracting stage, we
assume that workers observe the actual managerial ability

µs upon matching with their supervisors

and before deciding upon eort.

3. Supervisors observe

q

and provide ratings

r.

4. Workers are paid according to their contracted wage function.

B.2 The Informed Firm and Proposition 1
We begin by assuming that rms and workers are perfectly informed about the supervisors and workers
types :

(µs , βs , α).

Thus, wage contracts are:

w = a (µs , βs , α) + b (µs , βs , α) r
Substituting

(10)

into

(13)

and denoting by

es

the equilibrium eort that subordinates of supervisor

s

exert, we get:

r = α + (es + βs ) + εq = α + φs + εq
The parameter

φs

(14)

summarizes the variation in ratings that can be attributed to the supervisor.

The only uncertainty faced by workers at the contracting stage is about

εq , which is normally distributed.

We use well-known results on the expectation of log normal random variables (deGroot, 1970) to represent
worker preferences using the certainty equivalent and express the participation constraints as follows, where

IC

represents the information available during the contracting stage and

e∗

is the optimal eort level chosen

by the worker.

55

There is thus no advantage from assigning particular workers to particular supervisors. Thus, in equilibrium
any assignment is viable and both positive and negative assortative matching are entirely consistent with
our set-up.

Substituting the optimal eort

from eq.

and simplifying, we

obtain the participation constraint:

(17)

We next reproduce Proposition 1 from above, followed by the derivation.

Under perfect information about supervisor and worker types (µ , β , α ):
1. The optimal piece rate is given by b =
2. Expected output increases one-for-one with α , does not vary with β , and increases with µ ;
3. Expected compensation of workers increases one-for-one with α , does not vary with β , and increases
with µ i b < ;
4. Expected compensation of supervisors does not vary with α or β , and increases with µ ;
5. Workers do not earn economic rents; that is, worker surplus S = U (w − c(e)) = 0.

This results is the standard solution familiar from the literature and stated in point 1 of the proposition:

b∗s =

(19)

Substituting the optimal eort (equation 16) and piece rate (equation 19) into the output equation 10
results in

E [q|α, µs , βs ] = α + E [e|µs , βs ] = α + bs µs = α +

output increases onefor-one with

α,

βs

µs +ψσq2 µs . This establishes point 2: expected

and increases with

µs .

Competition in the labor market implies that prots from any worker-supervisor pair are zero:

α + bµs − ais − bs (α + βs + bµs ) − ws (µs , βs ) = 0
59 For

(20)

this, set up the prot maximization of the rm subject to the participation constraint. The rst-order condition with

respect to the intercept can be used to show that the Lagrange multiplier on the participation constraint equals 1, from which
the statement in the text follows.

56

where

ws (µs , βs )

is the wage paid to a supervisor with characteristics

(µs , βs ).

For expected compensation of workers (point 3), note that solving equation 20 implies that the rm
will set worker pay so that their certainty equivalent exactly equals the outside option:

E[w|IC ] = u (α) +

a(µs , βs , αi )

βs .

The reason is that the rm

 workers with more generous supervisors

simply see their base pay reduced. Competition also implies that expected compensation increases one-forone with

α.

To determine the eect on average compensation, we set the derivative of the certainty equivalent with
respect to

µs

equal to zero since we know the entire surplus is extracted from workers:

and a linear wage contract specifying the relation

between reported ratings and compensation conditional on the assignment.

The right-hand side of this expression increases monotonically in

that solves the rm's problem (point 1). Furthermore, as is apparent from equation 23, the optimal piece
rate declines in

For expected compensation of workers, we can again rely on similar arguments for Proposition 1.

As

before, the rm extracts any surplus from workers during the contracting stage. Again, competition in the
labor market implies that expected compensation increases one-for-one withα.
compensation does not depend on the known variation in leniency bias

βsE .

And, as before, expected

This is because it enters the

workers participation constraint (eq. 21) only through the expected wage. The rm can extract any variation
in

βsE

using the intercept of the wage contract and thus make the expected wage independent of

number of employees at each level. On the left are the percentages of the employees at an indicated level entering the
rm. On the right are those leaving. For example, 5.2 percent of employees working at level 4 entered the rm into
that level in the preceding year. 8.7 percent quit or were laid o from that level in a given year. The ows between
job levels are expressed as a percent of the origin level. For example, 9.6 percent of workers in level 4 are promoted
to level 5 in a given year; 0.2 percent are demoted. The numbers are averages over our sample period. Flows across

The diagram is restrict to the branch network of the rm. It is similar to Figure A2, except we also include ows
between the branch system and the central oce. The rectangles are proportional to the number of employees at
each level. On the left are the percentages of the employees at an indicated level entering the branches, either from
outside the rm (top arrow), or from the central oce (bottom arrow). The arrows to the right analogously show
exits from the rm (top) or to the central oce (bottom). For example, 2.7 percent of employees working at level 4
in the branch network entered the rm into that level in the preceding year; 3 percent of employees entered level 4
in the branch network from the central oce; 6 percent of workers in level 4 of the branch network leave the rm in
a given year and 8.2 percent move to the central oce. The ows between job levels are expressed as a percent of
the origin level, and restrict to moves within the branch network. For example, 11 percent of workers in level 4 are
promoted to level 5 in a given year; 0.2 percent are demoted; the level receives 9.2 percent of those working in levels
1-3 in a given year. The numbers are averages over our sample period. Flows across job levels not indicated in the
graph (for example a move from level 4 to level 6) are rare.

Notes: Table is restricted to workers present in the firm in t and t+1. Column (1) shows the distribution of moves by business units and job
levels (shares sum to 1); column (2) shows the share changing supervisor, conditional on the transition type. Columns 3-5 restrict to
observations where a supervisor switch did occur (as well as the indicated type of worker transition); column (3) shows the distribution
across transition types, conditional on superisor switch; column (4) shows the change in φ (the supervisor fixed effect in ratings),
conditional on switching; column (5) shows the change in ε (the transitory ratings component), conditional on switching. For row 1, for
example, column (1) shows that 3% of all observations present in the firm in adjacent years are promoted and switch to a new business
unit. Among this group (promoted and changed business units), 85% change supervisors (column 2). These supervisor changes make up
6% of all supervisor switches (column 3). The supervisor change results in an average change in phi (the supervisor ratings effect) of 0.004 (column 5) and an average change in ε (the transitory ratings component) of -0.128 (column 6).

Notes: The table shows where supervisors of workers in the prior period moved conditional on a worker experiencing a
supervisor switch. The table is restricted to workers present in the firm in t and t+1 who remain in the same job level and
business unit but switch supervisors (11,639 worker-year observations). Column (1) shows the distribution of moves of the
supervisor, by business units and job levels (shares sum to 1); column (2) shows the change in φ (the supervisor fixed effect in
ratings), conditional on the type of supervisor move; column (3) shows the change in ε (the transient component of ratings),
conditional on the type of supervisor move. For row 1, for example, column (1) shows that for 4% of all employees who switch
supervisors between t and t+1 (while remaining in the same job level and business unit), their supervisors are promoted and
move business units. At the same time, these workers experience an increase in φ of 0.038 (column 2) and an increase in ε of
0.02 (column 3) upon switching supervisors.

Notes: Column 1 presents OLS regressions of log earnings on ratings components for the full sample (see table 5). Column 2 restricts to
observations where the worker remained in the same job level and business unit between t and t-1 but experienced a change in supervisor.
Column 3 further restricts to observations where the t-1 supervisor moved job levels, business units, or left the sample. Column 4 further
restricts to observations where the t-1 supervisor left the sample. The split-sample IV estimates supervisor and worker effects in even and odd
years, separately, and use estimates in even years as instruments for estimates in odd years and vice versa. All regressions also include
controls listed in Table 3. Standard errors are clustered by supervisor. Significance levels are represented using stars: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, *
