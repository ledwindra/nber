The Decline in Black Teenage Employment: 1950—1970

ABSTRACT

This paper examines the causes of the decline in black male teenage em-

ployment from 1950 to 1970. During this period, the employment—to—population
ratio of black youth (age 16—19) declined from 46.8 percent to 27 percent.

The white teenage employment ratio, in contrast, remained constant. The primary source of the decline is traced to the virtual demise of the market for

low—skilled agricultural labor. All of the black teenage employment decline
during this period occurs in the South. The employment ratio among those
living outside the South actually increases. Within the South, the entire
decline in employment is accounted for by a reduction in agricultural employment.

This study argues that technological progress is the principal cause of

the agricultural employment decline among black youths. Spurred by the rapid
advance and adoption of labor—saving technology, southern agricultural production was transformed from a relatively labor intensive process to a highly

capital intensive one. As a result, the demand for low—skilled agricultural
labor plummeted. By 1970, a formerly important source of black youth employment virtually ceased to exist.

Black teenagers who were displaced from agricultural work were not ab-

sorbed by the nonagricultural sector. An additional finding of this paper is
that the federal minimum wage acted as an isnportant barrier to nonagricultural

employment in the South. The raw data reveal significant reductions in black
teenage employment growth in precisely those industries where coverage of the

minimum wage was increased: retail trade, construction, and the service sector.
Regression estimates indicate a quantitatively large minimum wage effect.

Introduction

In 1950, more than one out of every two black male teenagers (age 16—19)

as employed. By 1970 one out of three was employed. And by 1978, only one
out of every four was employed. Many hypotheses have been offered to explain
this precipitous decline. Among those often advanced are that the expanding
coverage of the federal minimum wage law has operated as an increased barrier
to employment; that black teenagers have become increasingly concentrated in
central cities where employment opportunities have been decaying; that the
growth in the size of the black teenage cohort has outstripped the demand
for their labor; and that the growth in the quality of education has induced
a substitution away from market work and toward school.

Recent empirical analysis suggests that each of these factors plays

only a minor role. For example, work by Nincer (1976) and Ragan (1978)
indicates that although the minimum wage has reduced black teenage employ—

ment, it accounts for only a small portion of the total decline. Likewise,
Wescott (1976) demonstrates that the decaying employment opportunities in

central cities contributes little to the overall decline. Finally, Wachter
and Kim (1979) find little empirical support for the baby-boom hypothesis.

Despite a large amount of analysis, the post—World War II decline in black
teenage employment remains, as yet, a largely unexplained phenomenon.

This paper examines the decline in black male teenage employment during

the period 1950—70. The point of departure of this work from earlier
research is that census data are used to analyze the causes of the fall in

employment. Most earlier research has relied on Current Population Survey
(CPS) data. The relatively small number of black youths sampled by the CPS
allows analysis only of time series trends. Census data, because of its

2

large sample size, permits analysis to be undertaken at the region or state

level. As will be seen, this level of disaggregation is crucial to under—
standing the causes of the decline in employment.
The principal finding of this research is that the primary source of

the decline in black teenage employment is the virtual demise of the market

for low—skilled agricultural labor. Except for the work of Cotterman (1979),
the importance of this market for black teenage labor has gone unrecognized

in the literature. In 1950, agricultural work constituted their primary
source of employment. Over 45 percent of all working black teenagers were
in agriculture, and in the South over one—half were so employed. Between
1950 and 1970 agricultural production underwent a dramatic transformation.

Farming became mechanized. Use of machines and mechanical power rose by
almost 20 percent, while employment declined by almost 56 percent. In the
South, the change was even larger. Total employment fell by 65 percent.
Sy 1970, the market for low—skilled agricultural labor ceased to he an

important source of employment for black youth. The effect of the mechanization of agriculture on black teenage employment is profound. Virtually all
of the reduction in the aggregate black teenage employment—to—population
ratio between 1950 and 1970 can be attributed to the decline in their agricultural employment.

Black teenagers who were displaced from agricultural work were not

absorbed into nonagricultural employment in the South. This paper examines
the possible role that the federal minimum wage law played. Evidence is
found that the extension of minimum coverage in retail trade, construction,
and the service industries substantially impeded the flow of black teenagers
into nonagricultural employment.

3

The outline of this paper is as follows: Section II documents intregional changes in black teenage employment between 1950 and 1970. These
intra—regional variations provide the key to uncovering the crucial 1-ole of

the market for agricultural labor. They also provide evidence which rejects
the declining central—city hypothesis and casts doubt on the growing cohort

size argument. Section III describes changes in the nature of agricultural
production during the 1950—70 period and examines their impact upon black

teenage employment. Section IV analyzes changes in the industrial composition
of nonagricultural employment among black teenagers. These changes provide
evidence of minimum wage effects. In Section V. regression estimates of the
effects of technological progress in agriculture and the growth in minimum
wage coverage are presented, and some concluding remarks are made.

II. Trends in Teenage Employment: 1950—1978

Figure 1 depicts the time series pattern of employment—to-population

ratios of black and white youths for the period 1950_1978.1 This figure
illustrates both the dramatic decline in the black teenage employment ratio
and the growing gap in employment between the races that has taken place

since the end of World War II. In 1950 more than one out of every two black
teenagers was employed. By 1978 only slightly over one out of four was
employed. The massive reduction in employment among blacks is in marked
contrast to the U—shaped employment pattern among whites. White teenage
employment, after declining through the 1950s, began to grow in the middle

1960s. Its growth continued during the 1970s despite setbacks in the
recessions of 1971 and 1975—76. These differential employment trends have
produced a remarkable divergence in employment ratios between the races.

In 1950 the proportion of black teenagers who were employed was marginally

above that of white teenagers. By 1978 the employment ratio of blacks had
fallen to one—half that of whites. This divergence is even more striking
when it is contrasted with the absence of any comparable divergence in

employment ratios of black and white prime—age males (age 25—54). Between

'Throughout this paper, the terms youth and teenagers refer to the 16—
19 year old male population. The data for the period 1954—78 are annual
averages taken from the Manpower Report of the President, 1975 and recent
issues of Employment and Earnings. Prior to 1954 counts of numbers employed
by race are unavailable. The employment ratios for these years were constructed as follows. Labor force participation and unemployment rates by
race and age are available back to 1948. Using these rates permits computing
the employment—to—civilian population ratio by race for 16-17 and 18—19 year
old age groups. The Current Population Report Series P—25 contains estimates
of the civilian and total population for these age groups by race as of
July 1 for the years 1950—1959. The employment—to—population ratio for 16—
19 year aids was computed by taking a weighted average of the 16—17 and 18—
19 year old employment—to—civilian population ratios using the ratio of the
civilian population in the two—year age groups to the average total population of the 16—17 and 18-19 year old groups as the weights.

1954 and 1970 the gap between employment ratios of white and black prime—age

males remained constant at roughly 6.5 percentage points. The gap grew to
10 percentage points by 1978.

A more informative look at changes in youth employment is provided in
Table 1, which presents region specific teenage employment—to--population

ratios for black and whites in 1950 and 1970.1 For reference, the regional
teenage population distribution for each year is provided in parentheses

beneath the employment ratios. The regional breakdown of employment ratios
indicates that aggregate trends in teenage employment, especially those of

blacks, mask important differences in intra—regional patterns. As is evident
from the table virtually all the decline in the aggregate black teenage
employment ratio is a result of a sharp decrease in employment in the South.

Bet'een 1950 and 1970 the Southern black teenage employment ratio halved

itself, with two—thirds of the decline occurring during the 1950s. Among

'It should be noted that teenage employment ratios computed from Census
data are considerably different than those computed from either the March or
April Current Population Surveys (CPS) in each of the Census years. Among
all teenagers, the April 1950 CPS employment ratio exceeds the Census employment ratio by 6.5 percentage points. Tn 1960 and 1970, the April CPS employment ratio exceeds the Census employment ratio by about 4 percentage points.
Data for 1970 indicate that the discrepancy between the two surveys is larger
for blacks than for whites. Among blacks the April 1970 CPS employment ratio
is 34.1 percent while the Census employment ratio is only 27.4 percent. I
have been unable to obtain CPS data on blacks in earlier Census years. Why
such differentials should exist is at present an open question. The survey
weekT for the CPS data is two weeks after the Census survey week. The question used to obtain employment information and the definition of employment
is the same in both surveys. In both surveys the respondent is not necessarily the teenager; it could be his parent or the head of his household.
One possible reason is in sampling design. The design of the CPS includes
a sample rotation feature. Under this feature a household is ideally in
the sample for 4 consecutive months, is out of the sample for 8 months, and
then returns to the sample for a final 4 months. This introduces a potential problem of attrition bias that is present in the CPS and not present
in the Census. If individuals with low probabilities of employment leave
the sample, then this would explain the discrepancy between the surveys.
It would also explain the finding of Freeman and Medoff (1978) that employment ratios in longitudinal surveys exceed those of the CPS.

7

whites, the Southern employment ratio also fell, but its decline is consid—
erably less than that of blacks and is offset by employment growth in the
Northeast and West regions of the country.

The importance of the decline in Southern black employment can be
further quantified by decomposing the decline in the aggregate black

teenage employment ratio into a change due to intra—regional employment
variations and a change due to the shift in population out of the tradition-

ally high employment South to the traditionally low employment North. Using
the 1950 population distributions to weight the intra—regional employment
variations implies that 100 percent of the decline in the aggregate blaci
teenage employment ratio is due to the decline in the Southern black teenage

employment ratIo. Using the 1970 population distributions implies that
almost 80 percent of the decline in the aggregate employment ratio is due to
the decline in the Southern employment ratio.

8

It is clear from the preceding that the source of much, if not all,

of the post—World War II decline in black teenage employment lies in the

South. The data in Table 1 also indicate that the absence of a growth in
the aggregate white teenage employment ratio stems from a ,decline in employ-

ment in the South and Northcentral regions, which offsets a growth in the

Northeast and West regions. An inspection of geographical division level
data within the Northcentral region reveals that white teenage employment in
the relatively rural West Northcentral division declined by almost 5 percentage points while it rose in the relatively urban East Northcentral

division by almost a percentage point. These observations provide the first
clue to the importance of the agricultural labor market in determining changes

in teenage employment between 1950 and 1970. But, before turning to this
story, the data provided in Table 1 reveal several other interesting facts
that deserve consideration.
Between 1950 and 1970 black teenage employment ratios outside the

South did not decline.' This fact, when combined with the growth in the
black teenage population, has important implications for the nature of

teenage labor demand outside the South. As a consequence of the low fertility rates in the depression of the 1930s and the post—World War II baby
boom, the size of the 16—19 year old black population increased considerably

between 1950 and 1970. During this period, the aggregate number of black
teenagers rose by 89 percent, while the entire U.S. population grew by only

40 percent. At the same time there occurred a pronounced geographical
shift in the black population out of the South and into the Northern regions

1There were important differences in employment variation in the Northeast region between the 1950s and 1960s. In the Northeast, the nonwhite
teenage employment ratio grew by 8 percentage points between 1950 and 1960,
and declined by 5.5 percentage points between 1960 and 1970. Employment
ratios in the Northcentral and Western states, on the other hand, remained
relatively constant between 1950 and 1969.

9

(see Table 1). The combination of the growth and shift in the population
produced a marked increase in the number of black teenagers residing in the

North. In the relatively short span of 20 years the number of black teenagers living in the North increased by 215 percent. More than 90 percent of
these teenagers took up residence in urban areas (SMSAs). The fact that
employment ratios in the Northern industrial centers of the U.S. did not
decline in the face of such an enormous growth in supply is indicative of
either a substantial growth in the demand for labor, or a fixed but very

elastic demand schedule in these urban centers. Indeed, the ability of
Northern urban labor markets to absorb such a massive influx of black
agers without corresponding reductions in their empiDyment—to—population

ratios is both surprising and impressive. The widely held view that the
root of the black teenage employment problem is in the decay of Northern
central cities is flatly rejected by the data, at least for the period 1950
to 1970.

The data are also inconsistent with the view that the growth in welfare
participation among blacks is at the heart of their employment decline.
During the 1960s, welfare participation rates grew more than three times

faster in the North than in the South.1 Finally, the data also suggest the
lack of importance of the growth in the number of black teenagers as the

central cause of the decline in their employment ratios. The decline in
black teenage employment is a purely regional phenomenon, occurring only
in the South.

'Between 1960 and 1970, AFDC participation rates in the North doubled
while the rate in the South increased by less than 50 percent (U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, 1961, 1971).

10

Comparisons of employment—to—population ratios between blacks and

whites in regions outside the South reveal another interesting fact. The
large gap in aggregate teenage employment ratios between the races that

emerges by 1970 existed outside the South as early as 1950. In 1970 the
aggregate white teenage employment ratio exceeded the aggregate black

teenage employment ratio by 13 percentage points. This is precisely the
magnitude of the racial employment differential outside the South in 1950.

In short, large racial differences in teenage employment in the North have

existed since at least 1950.1 That these differentials existed prior to

growth in welfare participation and benefit levels and prior to the
supposed deterioration of employment opportunities in Northern central
the

cities

is further evidence that these factors were not the primary causes

of

the decline in black teenage employment. Nor were they primary causes

of

the divergence in employment ratios between the races.
In summary, the picture portrayed by the region specific employment

ratios is clear: The primary source of the decline in black teenage
enployment

to

during the period 1950—70, both in absolute terms and relative

white teenagers, lies almost exclusively in the South, Contrary to

popular

belief, Northern industrial labor markets showed a remarkable

ability to absorb the large influx of black teenagers.

1Similar calculations for 1940 reveal a difference in employment
ratios between the races of 9.5 percentage points in non—Southern regions
of the country.

11

III. Teenage Employment and the Market for Agricultural Labor

The Setting: 1950
If the agricultural labor market is to have played a major role in the
decline in black teenage employment between 1950 and 1970, it must have been

an important source of their employment in 1950. Indeed it was. Agricultural
labor was by far the most dominant single form of their employment. In 1950,
46 percent of all employed black teenagers worked as agricultural laborers

(Census Bureau, 1950d).1 Agricultural labor was even more important in the
South, where over 50 percent of employed black teenagers worked as agricultural laborers and over one—half of these were classified as unpaid family
laborers (Census Bureau, 1950d).

2

In contrast, agricultural employment among white teenagers, though
important, was a less prevalent form of work than it was among blacks.
About 26 percent. of all employed white teenagers in the U.S. were agricultural

workers. There were also important differences in the geographical distribution of agricultural work between the races. Among black teenagers, agricultural work was almost exclusively a Southern phenomenon. Over 90 percent
lived in the South. Among whites, agricultural work was considerably more
dispersed. Forty—four percent lived in the South and 37 percent lived in
the Northcentral region. The remaining 18 percent were equally divided
between the West and Northeast (Census Bureau, 1950c).

1Agricultural employment is computed from occupation rather than
industry data. Industrial distributions of employment for the 16—19 year
old age group by race and sex in 1950 are not available.
order to be so classified, an individual must have reported working
at least 15 hours during the survey week without pay on a farm.

12

The critical role of the agricultural sector in accounting for regicnai
levels of black teenage employment

is

illustrated in Table 2. This table

decomposes regional black teenage employment ratios into the percent of the
population employed in agricultural work and nonagricultural work, respec-

tively. Differences in agricultural employment among blacks between the
North and South account for virtually all the differences in employment

ratios between the North and South. Furthermore, in an accounting sense,
the high level of employment in the South among black teenagers can be
attributed entirely to the high level of agricultural employment in the
South.

Among

whites, the evidence is much the same, although the role of

agricultural

employment, in accounting for regional differences in employment ratios, is less striking. Agricultural employment in the South
accounts for virtually all the difference between employment ratios in the
South and those in the Northeast and West. Agricultubal employment in the
Midwest accounts for 70 percent of the employment differential between the
Northcentral and Northeast regions

13

Changes in the Market for Agricultural Labor: 1950—1970
The decades of the 1950s and 1960s were a period of revolutionary

changes in the nature of agricultural production. The extent and type of
these changes for this period have been extensively documented and analyzed

by agricultural economists.1 Only a brief discussion of the dimensions of
these changes is presented here.

Within the relatively short span of 20 years, U.S. agricultural production was transformed from a relatively labor—intensive process to a highly

capital—intensive process. This transformation was fueled, in part, by a
growing demand for nonfarm labor. This raised the cost of farm labor relative to capital equipment and induced a substitution of machines for men.
It was also spurred by the rapid adoption of labor—saving technological
innovations, which may or may not have been induced by the rising cost of

farm labor. The adoption of technological innovations induced further
substitution of capital equipment for labor at existing relative prices.

Although there is considerable disagreement over the relative importance

of each, their combined impact was dramatic. The capital—labor ratio
almost tripled during this 20—year period (USDA, 1977). Output per man—hour
grew at an average rate of over 11 percent per year, producing a cumulative

increase of 238 percent between 1950 and 1970 (USDA, 1977). Thecombination
of these forces and the fact that farm output registered only a modest

1The list of studies dealing with this issue is fa too long to include
them all. Particularly useful descriptions of the important changes are
contained in Schertz (1975), Cochrane, Wilcox and Herdt (1973), Tweeten
(1970), and Peterson and Hayami (1977). Analyses of the impact of these
changes on farm labor are provided by Gisser (1967), Tyrchniewicz and
Schuh (1969), and Rosine and Heimberger (1976).

14

increase of 36 percent resulted in a dramatic reduction in farm employment.

Total hours of farm work declined by almost 60 percent (USDA, 1977))
The changes in the nature of farm production between 1950 and 1970

represented a marked increase over previous trends. The percentage
increase in output per man—hour between 1950 and 1970 far exceeded the
percentage increase that occurred during the entire first half of the 20th

century (USDA, 1977). The decline in total hours of farm work between 1950
and 1970 was more than 50 percent larger than the decline in hours of farm
work that took place during the first half of the 20th century (USDA, 1977),

The considerable degree of regional specialization of agricultural
production by product, combined with the differential rates of decline in
man—hours of work across agricultural products, produced significantly
different rates of decline in farm employment among the regions of the

country. Hardest hit was the South where farm employment declined by 65
percent between 1950 and 1970 (USDA, 1951, 1971). Reductions in farm
employment in other regions of the country, though far less dramatic than

in the South, were still quite large. In the relatively urbanized Northeast,
farm employment fell by 63 percent. In the Northcentral and West, farm
employment fell by 48 percent and 28 percent, respectively.

Within the South, cotton production was the most important type of

farming among blacks. In 1959, for example, cotton sales alone accounted
for 56 percent of the value of all farm products sold by black—operated

'Within the 20—year period 1950—1970, the changes in agricultural production which occurred during the 1950s were somewhat larger than those which
occurred in the 1960s. The growth rate in the capital—labor ratio in the
1950s, for example, exceeded that of the 1960s by 12 percent. Similarly, the
rate of growth in output per man—hour in the 1950s exceeded that of the 1960s
by 5 percent (USDA, 1977). Fifty—eight percent of the decline in hours of
farm work which occurred during the 20—year period took place in the 1950s
(USDA, 1977) .

15

farms (USDA, 1959).1 It was in cotton production where the largest changes
in technology occurred. The most important change was in widespread adoption
of the mechanical cotton picker. Although first introduced as early as 1943,
rapid adoption of the mechanical cotton picker in the South did not begin

until the late 1950s and 1960s. In 1950 less than 1 percent of all cotton
in the South was harvested by machine. By 1962, it had risen to 55 percent
and by 1970 most all cotton was mechanically harvested.2 The adoption of the
mechanical cotton picker, along with developments which enabled chemical and
oil herbicides to be applied mechanically, reduced labor utilization in
cotton significantly. During the period 1950—54 an average of 107 man—1iours

of labor were used to produce a bale of cotton. By 1970—74 only an average
of 23 man-hours were so used (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1978). The
combination of this reduction and the nearly zero growth in cotton production
between 1950 and 1970 resulted in an 80 percent reduction in man—hours used
in cotton during the 20—year period.

The impact of the changes in the nature of agricultural production on
employment of black teenagers is strikingly evident from the data reported

in Table 3. The table compares changes in the black teenage total employ—
ment—to—population ratio to changes in the agricultural employment—to—

population ratio. As is evident, all of the decline in the black teenage
employment ratio, both in the U.S. as a whole and in the South, is accounted

for by a decline in agricultural employment. Likewise, the decline in

1Tobacco production was the other major type of farming, accounting for
an additional 26 percent of the value of all farm products sold by black—
operated farms.

Texas and Oklahoma.

16

agricultural employment accounts for most of the narrowing of the North—South
differential in black teenage employment ratios that was documented in Table 1.1
Within the South, it appears that mechanization of cotton production

played a critical role. In 12 cotton—producing Southern states the simple
correlation between cotton's share of total farm receipts in 1950 and. the

change in the black teenage employment ratio between 1950 and 1970 is _57•2

State Summaries. Alaska and Hawaii are excluded. Data on blacks includes non—
whaites. Agricultural employment—to—population ratios for 1970 are also derived
from the state summaries. But, because data on all nonwhites are not provided,
these ratios are based solely on the black population.
1Among white teenagers, the decline in agricultural employment also
appears to play a significant role. The total employment—to—nopulation ratio
among white teenagers declined in only two of the four regions of the country
between 1950 and 1970: the South (5 percentage points) and the Northcentral
(1.7 percentage points). In the South the fraction of white teenagers employed
in agriculture declined by 13 percentage points and the Northcentral declined
by 10 percentage points.
2Cotton production data could only be obtained for 13 of 16 Southern states.
These states are Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, South Carolina, Louisiana, Texas,
Tennessee, Georgia, Oklahoma North Carolina, Florida, and Virginia (USDA, 1952).
In these states the average (unweighted) decline in the employment ratio was 26.4
percentage points. The reduction among these cotton—producing states, when compared to the employment reduction in the remaining three non—cotton—producing
Southern states, Kentucky, Maryland, and West Virginia, and the District of
Columbia, provides even more compelling evidence of the impact of mechanization
in cotton. In these three non—cotton states and the District of Columbia, the
average (unweighted) employment ratio declined by only 6.7 percentage points.

17

In data not reported in Table 3, the decline in black teenage agricultural
employment appears equally important in accounting for the decline in total black

teenage employment during the l950s and 960s taken separately, as it does for

the entire 20—year period taken as a whole. Two—thirds of the decline in the
Southern agricultural employment—to—population ratio between 1950 and 1970 oc-

curred during the first 10 years. Similarly, two—thirds of the 1950—1970 decline
in the black teenage total employment—to—population ratio also occurred during
the l950s.

Agricultural economists have long debated the issue of whether the decline
in agricultural employment was a fesult of a growing demand for nonfarm labor or

an exogenous growth in labor—saving production technologies. Although a complete
treatment of this issue is beyond the scope of this paper, the data suggest that
the forces driving the mechanization of agriculture were exogenous to the black

teenage labor market. First, if the decline in agricultural employment was due
to a growth in the demand for nonfarm labor, one would have expected a growth

in the fraction of black teenagers working in nonagricultural jobs. As a comparison between the colums of Table 3 reveals, there is virtually no increase in
the fraction of black teenagers working in nonagricultural occupations between

1950 and 1970. Second, available measures indicate that the growth in nonagricultural industries was substantially larger in the South than in the North be-

tween 1950 and 1970. The growth rate of value added in manufacturing, for
example, was 50 percent higher in the South than in the North between 1950 and

1970. Similarly, between 1948 and 1967 annual receipts of retail trade establishments increased 30 percent faster in the South than in the North. If there
as no simultaneous downward shift in the demand curve for black teenage
agricultural workers, one would have expected a Southward migration of black

teenagers. Precisely the opposite occurred, as black teenagers migrated northward in substantial numbers.

18

If the rapid advance of labor—saving agricultural technologies is ti—

driving

force behind the decline in black teenage employment, then it is

still only half of the story. There still remains the issue of why black
teenagers who were, in effect, displaced from agricultural employment did
not find employment in nonagricultural work, especially in the South.1

One possible explanation is that they faced an important barrier to non-

agricultural employment. The federal minimum wage is a likely candidate
for this barrier. At the same time agricultural work was drying up as a
source of employment, coverage of the federal minimum wage was being
extended to include workers in retail trade and the service industry; and
the level of the minimum wage was being increased relative to the wage of

low—skilled workers in other industries. The next section is devoted to
an examination of the possible role of the minimum wage.

'Black teenagers appear to be somewhat unique in this respect. Older
black males, such as those age 25—34, in 1950 were absorbed into the nonagricultural sector. Their employment ratio remined constant between 1950
and 1970 (Census Bureau, 1950, 1970). White teenagers were partially
absorbed. See footnote 1 on page 16.

IV. Minimum Wage Legislation and Black Teenage Employment

Minimum Wage Legislation
The impact of the federal minimum wage on black teenage employment has
been the subject of extensive empirical analysis during the last decade.'
The prevailing conclusion reached by this research seems to be that its
impact is small relative to the total decline in their employment—to—popula-

tion ratio. Despite this rather impressive body of evidence, the fact that
black teenagers who were displaced from agriculture did not find employment
in the nonagricultural work in the South suggests that another look at the
possible role of minimum wages is warranted.

In 1950 coverage of the federal minimum wage law was limited primarily

to employees engaged in production for interstate commerce. Employees in
retail trade and service industry establishments engaged in intrastate

commerce were specifically exempted from coverage. As a result, coverage
rates (the fraction of employees in firms covered by the law) differed

considerably across industries. In some industries, coverage was nearly

universal. For example, the coverage rate in mining was 99 percent, in
manufacturing 95 percent, and in transportation and public utilities it was

98 percent (Welch, 1978). In other industries, coverage was small or nonexistent. For example, the coverage rate in retail trade was only 13 percent,
in the service industry 19 percent, and agricultural workers were completely

exempt from coverage (Welch, 1978). Individual state minimum wage laws
covering minors and women employed in retail trade and the service industry
were in effect in 1950, but their existence was confined almost exclusively

to Northern and Western states. In the South, only Kentucky and the

'The list of such studies is far too long to include them all. o of
the most widely cited studies includes Mincer (1976) and Ragan (1978).

20

District of Columbia had minimum wage laws covering teenagers (Women's
Bureau, 1958).

Between 1950 and 1960, there was no extension in coverage under the

federal minimum wage. The level of the minimum, however, was increased in
April 1956 from 756 cents per hour to $1.00 per hour. Also, during this
period there were only minor changes in state minimum wage laws. In the
South, North Carolina was the only state to adopt a state minimum wage for

teenagers. It did so in 1960.
The decade of the 1960s, on the other hand, was one of rather substan—
tialL increases in coverage of the minimum wage. Federal legislation enacted
in 1961 and 1966 extended coverage significantly in retail trade, construction, and the service industries.1 By 1970, 59 percent of all employees in
retail trade, 98 percent of all construction workers, and 71 percent of all

service industry workers were covered. The 1966 legislation also extended
coverage to agricultural workers on large farms.

By 1970 the federal minimum wage for workers in firms that were subject

to coverage prior to the 1966 legislation reached $1.60 per hour. Employees
in firms that were covered for the first time by the 1966 legislation reached

$1.45 per hour in 1970. State minimum wage levels rose less rapidly than
the federal minimum wage during the 1960s. As a result, by 1970 most state
minima were lower than the federal minimum wage (welch, 1978).2

1The mechanism by which thi was accomplished was to lower the volume
of sales exemption for establishments in these industries.
2State minimum wage levels in Alaska, California, New york, and the
District of Columbia exceeded the federal minimum wage in 1970.

21

Evidence on Employment Effects of Minimum Wages — The Raw Data
Given the disparity in coverage rates across industries and differences
in wage distributions across industries, a natural place to look for possible
minimum wage effects on black teenage employment is in changing patterns of

industrial employment. Unfortunately, census employment data by industry
are not available in published documents for 16—17 year old black teenagers

in 1950. It is, however, available for the 18—19 year old age group. As a
result, data on 18—19 year olds are used. Comparisons of changes in total
employment and agricultural employment between the two age groups reveal

virtually identical changes. Hence, explanations that apply to the 18—19
year old group should apply equally to the 16—19 year old age group. Also,
data on the industrial composition of black teenage employment by region or
state are not available in published statistics from the 1950 Census.

Nevertheless, a clear picture of the changing industrial employment patterns
of Southern black teenagers during the 1950s can be painted by examining
changes in aggregate black teenage industrial employment distributions, and
supplementary information derfved from other sources.

Table 4 provides the nonagricultural employment distribution of 18—19
year old black males in 1950 and the percentage change in their employment

by industry during the 1950s and 1960s. For comparison, percentage changes
in total employment by industry, and changes in minimum wage coverage rates,

are also provided. As column 1 reveals, the service sector, retail trade,
and the durable goods manufacturing industry accounted for two—thirds of all

black teenage nonagricultural employment in 1950. Employment in durable
goods was heavily concentrated in the Southern woodmills. In fact, the
Southern woodmills constituted a principal source of nonagricultural employ-

ment among Southern black teenagers. Almost one in every five Southern

black teenagers employed in nonagricultural work was working in the woodmills.

1

The percentage changes in employment in these industries provide some

indication of an important minimum wage effect in the l950s. The decline
in black teenage employment in the durable goods manufacturing (32 percent)
was entirely a result of a collapse of the Southern woodmills as a source

of employment. Outside the woodmills black teenage employment in durable
goods industries actually rose by 11 percent. Two BLS wage and employment
surveys of the Southern woodmills taken in 1955 and 1957 (DOL, 1959) provide
rather convincing evidence that at least part of this employment reduction

resulted from an increase in the federal minimum wage. In April of 1956 the
minimum was raised from 75 cents per hour tc5 $1.00 per hour. According to

the first survey, conducted during the last quarter of 1955, the average wage
paid to all production workers in late 1955 was 91 cents per hour, almost 10

percent below the April 1956 minimum wage. Perhaps more importantly, 74 percent of all production workers in late 1955 were earning below the April 1956

minimum wage. The second industry survey, conducted in April 1957, suggests
that the 1956 minimum wage increase swept away the lower tail of the wage

distribution, and along with it a substantial number of workers. In April
Of 1957 less than 3 percent of all production workers were earning below the

minimum wage, but total employment in the industry had fallen 15 percent,

since the last quarter of 1955. This employment decline, occurring in the
relatively short span of five quarters, constituted 33 percent of the decline

1Data on woodmill employment is taken from Census Bureau, 1950e and

in sawmills and logging were employed in the South. Total nonagricultural

24

in the industry's employment during the period 1953—1962. Black teenage
employment in the industry declined by 74 percent between 1950 and 1960.
Just how much of this was due to the increase in the minimum wage, however,
is at present unclear.'

As the data in column 2 of Table 4 indicate, employment of black teenagers in retail trade and the service industry grew rapidly during the

1950s. Black teenagers who found employment during this decade found jobs
almost entirely in these two industries. In fact, employment in retail
trade alone accounted for 91 percent of the entire growth in black teenagers

in nonagricultural employment during the 1950s. The employment increase in
these industries is not surprising since they were major growth industries

in this period. It is also perhaps significant that these industries were,
for the most part, not covered by the federal minimum wage law. Although
the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates the coverage rate in the service
sector at 19 percent during the period, most low—skilled service jobs such
as personal service workers, hotel, restaurant, recreation, hospital workers,
and gasoline station attendants, were not covered.

As a comparison between columns 2 and 5 of Table 4 indicates, the
industrial growth rates of black teenage employment in the 1960s were

radically different from those of the 1950s. The most striking differences
between the decades are in retail trade, manufacturing, and the "other"
category, in which transportation and communications accounted for most of
the 1960—70 growth.

1Data on integrated and nonintegrated woodmills provide supporting
evidence of a substantial minimum wage effect. Integrated woodmills are
mills that are engaged in both logging and millwork. Workers in such mills
employing 12 or fewer employees were exempt from minimum wage coverage in
1949. Between 1949 and 1957, employment in nonexempt woodmills declined by
48 percent while employment in the integrated mills declined by only 13
percent.

25

During the 1960s, growth of black teenage employment in retail tradc

was only two—thirds as large as it was during the 1950s. This occurred
despite the fact that total employment in the industry grew twice as
rapidly during the 1960s as it did during the 1950s, and despite the fact
that the percentage increase in the size of the black teenage population
in the 1960s (age 18—19) was over five times larger than it was during the
1950s.'

The growth in black teenage manufacturing employment, on the other

hand, was much larger in the 1960s than in the 1950s. Most of the growth
occurred in textile mills (22 percent) ,

metal

industries (22 percent) , and

the automotive industry (12 percent). However, there are several pieces of
evidence which suggest that the slow growth in retail tradets employment of
black teenagers resulted from something other than competition from the

growing manufacturing sector. First, the annual growth rate of total
employment in retail trade during the 1960s was two and one—half times that

of manufacturing employment. Raw data on employment and population changes
from the Census of Population provide a second piece of evidence. The black
teenage population (ages 18—19) increased by almost 150,000 individuals

during the 1960s. The decline in agriculture employment during this period
released an additional 16,000 black teenagers, leaving over 166,000 to be

absorbed into employment in the nonagricultural sector. Of these, about
57,000 found employment in nonagricultural work outside of retail trade.
Black teenage employment in retail trade increased by 8,500, or only about

8 percent of the increase in those not employed elsewhere. Fourth, if the

'The growth of black teenage retail—trade employment during the 1960s
was much slower in the South than outside the South. Between 1960 and 1970,
Southern black teenage employment in the industry rose by only 14 percent.

26

demand for black teenage labor in manufacturing and retail trade both
increased, one would have expected a large increase in their nonagricultural

employment—to—population ratio. It rose, but only by 3 percentage points.
A close inspection of retail trade employment data reveals that the
lack of employment growth among black teenagers during the 1960s was a

relatively uniform occurrence among all types of retail trade jobs. It was
not the case that growth in some sectors was offset by reductions in others.

Also, output per worker in retail trade shows no appreciable increase rela-

tive to the aggregate nonfarm sector or to manufacturing (BLS, 1978). Thus,
there appears to be no evidence of any important technical advances of

labor—saving type in retail trade relative to these sectors. Finally, the
fraction of trade workers that were in unions did increase, but only by two

and one—half percentage points (BLS, 1978). Moreover, in 1970 only 10 percent of trade workers were covered by collective bargaining agreements.

Hence, it appears that growth in unionization of employees in the industry
was not an important factor in slowing the growth of black teenage employment in the industry.

Wage distributions in retail trade derived from BLS surveys indicate
a potentially important role for minimum wage increases in explaining the
relatively slow growth of black teenage employment in the industry,

especially in the South. The 1961 and 1966 minimum wage laws established
two minimum wages——one for workers in firms covered by prior legislation
and one for workers in firms covered for the first time by the 1961 minimum

wage law. The 1961 minimum wage was set at $1.15 per hour for previously
covered workers, and $1.00 per hour for newly covered workers. The 1966
legislation set the wage floor at $1.40 per hour for previously covered

workers, and $1.00 for newly covered workers. In June of 1961, seven

27

months prior to the effective date of the new minimum wage law, 14 percent
of all nonsupervisory retail trade employees in the U.S. earned below the
lower wage floor, and 31 percent received a wage below the higher wage

floor. But in the South, wages in retail trade were much lower than in
the rest of the country. As a result, 31 percent earned below the lower
minimum wage and 51 percent earned below the higher minimum wage (DOL, 1962).
In June of 1966, seven months prior to the effective date of the 1966 minimum
wage, only 3 percent of all retail trade employees in the U.S. and 8 percent
of all retail trade employees in the South earned a wage below the lower wage

floor. However, 33 percent of all retail trade employees in the U.S. and
49 percent of retail trade employees in the South earned a wage below the

higher wage floor (DOL, 1967).l
Unfortunately, data on wages of black teenagers relative to those of
all employees in retail trade are not available for the years of interest.
Without such data it is not possible to tell precisely what fraction of
black teenage workers were earning wages below the minimum wages set by the

1961 and 1966 legislation. Nevertheless, it would not be unreasonable to
suppose that well over one—half, if not three—fourths, of all black teenage
workers in retail trade in the South were earning wages below the minimum
wage in the year prior to the new levels set by the 1961 and 1966 legisla-

tion. If so, the minimum wage would be expected to have an impact on their
employment in the industry. Some estimates of the magnitude of its effect
are presented in the next section.

1The 1966 legislation specified increases in the minimum wage through
1971. These increases were large. The minimum for workers on previously
covered firms increased to $1.60 in 1968 and remained constant through 1971.
The minimum for workers in firms covered by the law for the first time in
1966 increased by 15 cents per year to $1.60 in 1971.

28

V. Estimates of Partial Effects

The Data and Regression Specification
This section presents reduced form estimates of the partial effects of

technological progress in agriculture, the increased coverage and level of
the minimum wage, and other factors on the employment of black teenagers

between 1950 and 1970. Reduced form rather than structural parameters are
estimated because the absence of reliable wage data on black teenagers
precludes estimation of a complete structural model.

The data are state aggregates taken from the 1950, 1960, and 1970

Census of Population. State level data on black teenage employment are
only available for 30 states and the District of Columbia in 1950,1 but in
each year these 31 observations account for over 90 percent of the entire

black teenage population. The sample usd to estimate the reduced form
parameters is, therefore, limited to these observations.

Two equations characterize the system to be estimated. The first
expresses the change in the state's black teenage employment—to—population
ratio between 1950 and 1960 as a function of changes in regressors during

these two years. The specification of the second equation is identical to
the first, except all variables are defined as changes between 1960 and

1970. The observations are weighted by the average size of the state's
black teenage population over the three Census years.2 The equation system

Mountain, and New England divisions of the country. They are North Dakota,
South Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska, Iowa, Montana, Nevada, Idaho, Utah,
Colorado, Wyoming, Maine, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermont, Oregon,
Wisconsin, Delaware, Alaska, and Hawaii.

2Residuals from unweighted regressions were heteroscedastic. Weighting
provided residuals that appeared homoscedastic, although no tests were performed. Alternative weighting schemes, such as the square root of the
average population, yielded results that are virtually identical to those
presented in the text.

29

is estimated with generalized least squares to account for correlation
between the residuals in the two equations.

Explanatory Variables
In order to empirically measure the change in the demand for agricultural labor that results from technological progress, one must, at minimum,
specify an empirical agricultural production function and characterize the
nature of the technological advance in terms of measurable changes in the

production function. In general, the approach taken here is to assume a
production function for each state, and assume that the technological
progress maintains the form of the production function, but alters its

parameters. Under these assumptions, the change in the demand for agricul—
tural labor in the 1th state, due to technological advance, can be written
as:

(1)

AL. =

where C is a vector of production function parameters, P is a vector of
initial input prices, and y is a vector of parameters of the demand function
for agricultural output.

Specifically, the assumed form of the production function is a constant

returns to scale Cobb—Douglas function with two inputs: labor and an aggregate of all other inputs.1 The computational details of constructing the

30

change in the demand for labor are related to Appendix I and only the
essential ingredients and assumptions are presented here.

Assuming a Cobb—Douglas production function, calculating the change
in the demand for labor that results from technological progress requires
data on labor's share of total production costs, the wage rate paid to farm
labor relative to price of the aggregate of all other inputs, and the elas-

ticity of demand for agricultural products. Labor's share of total costs
is empirically defined as the product of the annual average wage paid to

hired farm labor and annual hours of farm work, divided by current operating

expenses. The farm wage rate is the annual average wage rate paid to hired
farm labor in the state. The price of the aggregate of all other inputs is
assumed to be constant across states and is taken from data reported by

Rosine and Heimberger (1978). The elasticity of demand for agricultural
products is also assumed to be constant across states, and is set equal to
—.1.

There are obvious potential problems with this approach. The assumption
of a particular production and the specification of technological progress
are arbitrary and need not necessarily reflect the true state of technologi-

cal progress. Moreover, in the Cobb—Douglas function changes in labor's
share of total cost are assumed to result solely from changes in technology.

If the elasticity of substitution between inputs is not unity, changes in
labor's shares will result from variations in relative prices of inputs and,

hence, may reflect a growth in demand for nonfarm labor rather than tech-

nology. Finally, the assumption of a single production function may not be
correct if production functions among specific agricultural products differ.

If commodity—specific production functions differ, differences in labor's
share across states and time will reflect differences in agricultural

31

product mix and changes in product mix rather than technological advance.

Nevertheless, if one is interested in the effect of changes in agricultural
production technology on black teenage employment, then some assumptions
about the underlying production function and how the technological advance

alters this function must be made. The Cobb—Douglas function provides a
simple characterization of the technological change and enables t:his change
to be calculated from readily available data.

The variable used to measure the change in the coverage and the level
of the federal minimum wage is analogous to the measure commonly used in
time—series analysis of minimum wage effects (Mincer, 1976 and Ragan, 1978).
The variable is the weighted change between census years in the federal

minimum wage relative to the average manufacturing wage in the state. The
weight is percentage of nonagricultural employment of all black males in the

state covered by the federal minimum wage law. To be precise, let C. denote

1Coverage rates by industry for 1950 and 1960 were taken from Welch
(1978) and the 1970 coverage rate was obtained indirectly from BLS through
Kim Cunningham. Employment by industry is for all black males age 14 and
older, and it is taken from the 1950, 1960, and 1970 Census of Population,
State Sunm-aries. The source for the average manufacturing wage is BLS,
1978. Alternative definitions of the minimum wage were also considered.
These are discussed later in this section.

32

Federal coverage rates by industry are used rather than state coverage

rates because the latter are unavailable. The primary sources of variation
in the minimum wage variable are different between the two decades. Between
1950 and 1960 there was no change in industry—specific coverage rates.

Hence, the only sources of variation during this decade are differences in
industrial composition and growth rates of the federal minimum wage relative
to average manufacturing wages across states. Between 1960 and 1970, as was
noted earlier, there were important changes in coverage rates in three

industries——retail trade, services, and construction. Changes in coverage
rates in these industries combined with differences in their shares of nonagricultural employment working across states provide the primary source of
variation during this decade.

The change in the state's real level of retail sales (expressed in 1950

dollars) is used to measure the growth in the demand for nonfarm labor. Data
on retail sales by state is taken from the various censuses of business.

At the state level, the growth in retail sales matches quite closely the

growth in receipts of the service industry. A correlation between changes
in these variables across states is .93 during the 1950s and .94 during the

1960s. As a result, the retail sales variable is likely to also capture the
effects of the service sector growth.

Three other explanatory variables were used. These were the change in
the size of the black teenage population (age 16—19) in the state, a South

33

dummy variable, and measure of the change in the quantity of schooiin
the state. The school variable deserves some comment.
Obviously, teenage employment and school enrollment are jointly deter-

mined by the same factors. Hence, inclusion of school enrollment in an
equation determining employment is not justified on theoretical grounds.

Moreover, because it is endogenous, it creates problems in interpreting

other estimated parameters. The reason for its inclusion is to try to
capture the effect of the growth in the quality dimension of black schooling.
There is evidence that the 1950s, and especially the 1960s, were a period

of rather significant increases in the quality of schooling. Quantifying

this increase, however, is difficult. One possible set of measures are
inputs to schooling, but state—level data on such variables are unavailable.
For example, data on expenditures—per--pupil, although available for all

elementary and secondary schools, are not available for schools attended by

blacks except in some Southern states in 1950 and 1958.1 In lieu of expenditure data on black schools, one might be tempted to use expenditure data on

all schools. However, comparisons between expenditures on white and black
schools in 1950 in states where they are separately tabulated, reveal rather

large differences. Similar comparisons for 1958 reveal significant differences in expenditure growth rates on black and white schools. Use of school
expenditure data on all students is, therefore, likely to systematically

understate the growth in expenditures on black students. The same argument
applies to other measurable inputs to school quality, such as teacher—pupil

ratios and average teacher salaries. Given the potential importance of the

states in 1950 and the Southern Regional Education Service (1960) provides

growth in school quality, some control variable is desirable. Since the usc
of the change in school enrollment is likely to overstate the contribution
of the quality of schooling to the decline in black teenage employment, the
regressions are also estimated excluding it.

Table 5 reports the regression results both with and without the school

enrollment rate variable in the regression. Equality constraints between
parameters in the equations for the two decades have been imposed where

appropriate. To determine which parameters to constrain, the equations
were first estimated without imposing constraints with generalized least

squares. These results are reported in Appendix II. Tests of equality
between the estimated effects of the change in the demand for agricultural
labor (AgProd), the change in retail sales, the change in the black teenage
population, and the change in school enrollment rate in each decade were

performed. These tests, on each pair of coefficients individually and on
the entire set of equality constraints taken jointly, could not reject the

hypothesis of equal effects between the decades. The effect of the change
in the minimum wage was virtually zero and not statistically significant in
the 1950—60 regression, and this was constrained to equal zero.'
The estimated coefficients in the two regressions are similar, as are

their standard errors. The only notable differences are in the estimated
effect of population size and the coefficient on the South dummy. The
effect of population size becomes not statistically different from zero in

the regression that excludes the school enrollment rate. The coefficient
on the South dummy increases in importance in the same regression.

Taken together the regressors explain most of the decline in the block

teenage employment ratio between 1950 and 1970. The regression specification
that includes the school enrollment rate explains the entire decline, and

the regressionthat excludes it explains 80 percent of the decline (see
Table 6).

In each specification, the regressors underpredict the employment

decline during the l950s and overpredict the decline somewhat in the 1960s.
Similarly, the regressors explain most of the narrowing of employment
differences between the South and the rest of the country.

During the 1950s the difference in black teenage employment ratios
between the South and the rest of the country declined by 20 percentage

points. The coefficients on the South dummy in the two equations imply
that between 8 and 10 percentage points remain unexplained. During the
1960s, the difference in employment ratios between the regions declined by

8 percentage points. Virtually all of this decline is accounted for by the
regressors.

The regression coefficients per se are not informative as to the quanti-

tative importance of each variable. But by multiplying each coefficient by
the change in the value of its respective regressor, the partial contribution

of each variable to the decline in employment can be computed. These partial
contributions are provided in Table 6.

These accounting results assign the major cause of the decline in black
teenage employment between 1950 and 1970 to two factors——technological prog-

ress in agriculture and the increased coverage of the minimum wage. Each of

these factors accounts for about one—half of the employment decline. These
accounting results are not particularly sensitive to the exclusion of the

school enrollment rate variable. The accounting results assign relatively

'The change in the value of each regressor is computed as the difference in the weighted state—level mean between 1950 and 1970, where the weights
are the fraction of black teenagers living in the state in 1950 and 1970, re--spectively.

minor roles to the growth in the size of the black teenage population and

the

growth in school enrollments.1

The contribution of technological progress in agriculture is perhaps
expected, given the rather pronounced importance of the agricultural sector

in the raw data reported earlier. The contribution of the minimum wage is
perhaps not expected, especially if one's prior view is based on the earlier

results on minimum wages by Mincer (1976), Ragan (1978), and others. The
large minimum wage effect, therefore, deserves some special consideration.

When the two components of the minimum wage variable——the change in
coverage and the change in the level of the minimum wage relative to the
average manufacturing wage——are entered separately in the regression,

virtually all the minimum wage effect can be attributed to the increase in

coverage. This is perhaps because the level of the minimum wage remained
constant relative to the average manufacturing wage between 1950 and 1970.

If so, it would also explain the absence of a minimum wage effect in the

1950—60 regression. During the 1950s, the level of the minimum wage relative to the average manufacturing wage remained constant and there was no
increase in coverage rates.

Several additional regressions were estimated in an attempt to check

the robustness of the estimated minimum wage effect. The results of these

'In regressions not reported the agriculture variable was replaced by
a simpler and more direct measure of the decline in the demand for black
agricultural employment: the change in the number of black agricultural
workers age 20 and older. The results were virtually identical to those
reported in the text.

2Actually, because of changes in the industrial composition of black
male employment during the l950s, the fraction of the nonagricultural black
employment covered by the minimum wage declined slightly from 58 percent to
56 percent.

39

regressions are noteworthy. First, the minimum wage variable computed fnr
the decade of the l960s was included in the 1950—60 regression. Since there
was no increase in coverage rates during the 1950s, a significant effect of
this variable in the 1950—60 regression would serve as an indication that
the minimum wage variable is capturing the effects of omitted variables

common to employment changes during the two decades. The estimated effect
in the 1950—60 regression was small, positive, and not statistically significant.

Second, to determine whether the minimum wage variable might be capturing omitted state—specific business cycle employment fluctuations between
1960 and 1970, the minimum wage variable was entered In a regression explain-

ing employment—to—population ratios of all males age 20 and older.1 Its
coefficient was small and not statistically significant.

Third, the minimum wage variable itself was modified. One modification
was to base the change in coverage on the 1960 industrial employment distri-

bution of all black males. Another was to replace the black male industrial
employment distribution with that of all individuals age 14 and older. The
results obtained with the first modification raised the estimated minimum
wage effect substantially, while the second did not alter the estimated
impact.

1Also included in this regression was the agricultural labor demand
variable, the retail sales variable, the change in the age 20 and older
male population, and a South dummy.

Conclusions

The paper has documented the role of the decline in the demand for low—
skilled agricultural labor as the driving force behind the sizable reductions

in aggregate black teenage employment during the period 1950—1970. Although
commonly cited factors, such as the migration of firms out of the central
cities of the North, the growth in welfare programs, and the rapid increase
in the size of the black teenage population, may have contributed to the

decline in employment, their importance seems negligible. Within the agricultural sector, this paper has attempted to measure the impact of the rapid

advance of labor—saving technology on the decline in employment. The estimates imply that technological progress accounts for one—half of the decline

in the aggregate black teenage employment ratio. But, because of the
inherent difficulties in measuring technological change, this estimate
should be regarded with caution.

Although the decline in the demand for agricultural labor has played a
principal role, it does not explain why black teenagers who were displaced
from agricultural work were not absorbed into the nonagricultural sector in

the South. Increases in the level of the federal minimum wage during the
1950s, and in coverage rates during the 1960s, is offered as a potential

explanation. The raw data (for the 1950s and 1960s) and the estimated
regressions (for the 1960s alone) provide evidence that the minimum wage
law acted as a substantial barrier to nonagricultural employment among

Southern black teenagers. Although the analysis supports this explanation,
the size of the disemployment effect is far larger than previous estimates
and thus should be regarded with a certain amount of caution.
