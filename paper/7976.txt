Introduction

Financing early stage businesses involves special problems and is fundamentally diﬀerent from financing investments by mature and well established
companies. Because of lacking collateral and the absence of any past track
record, and due to their informational advantages, pioneering entrepreneurs
often face severe diﬃculties in convincing banks to finance projects with
potentially high returns but high risks as well. Another problem that contains the roots of business failure, is the commercial inexperience of new
entrepreneurs. They tend to be equipped with excellent technical science expertise but usually lack business experience and managerial training. Venture
capital has come to specialize in financing early stage investment. Venture
capitalists (VCs) not only supply equity finance but also provide valuable
business advice to enhance survival chances of new start-ups. Viewing startup investment as a key source of innovation, growth and employment, policy
makers often emphasize the need to enhance entrepreneurship and venture
capital activity.1
1

A recent OECD report on Austria, for example, includes a special feature on promot-

ing entrepreneurship, see OECD (1999). Similar issues are also discussed in European

1

The traditional literature on entrepreneurship, risk bearing and taxation
ignores a distinct feature of venture capital finance, i.e. the productive contribution of financiers to the survival and success of start-up firms.2 The
tax literature on adverse selection in investment finance similarly excludes
an active role of financiers.3 Despite the importance attached to venture
capital by the policy community, a systematic analysis of public policy in
this context has largely been neglected. The exceptions are Gordon (1998)
and Poterba (1989a,b). Gordon points to the importance of tax avoidance
through business ownership as a determinant of entrepreneurship. In this
context, he briefly addresses the implications of asymmetric information for
the availability of outside equity finance such as venture capital and also
studies the role of various tax instruments. Poterba investigates the eﬀects
of capital gains taxes on the supply of venture capital. Neither of them is
very specific on the contractual problems in VC finance. Both abstract from
managerial support and tax incentives on this margin. Many business failCommission (1999).

See, for example, Boadway et al. (1991), Peck (1989), Kihlstrom and Laﬀont (1983),

Mintz (1981), Kanbur (1980), and Buchholz and Konrad (1999) for a recent overview.

ures, however, result from avoidable management mistakes that originate in
the managerial incompetence of entrepreneurs in the early stages of their
career. An active role of VCs in providing valuable business advice might
be an important factor in raising survival chances of start-up businesses. It
thus seems interesting to ask which factors determine the incentives to provide advice. Could taxes and other government activity improve upon such
incentives and, thereby, boost survival rates by improving the ‘quality’ of
venture capital finance?
This paper extends the existing literature on entrepreneurship and taxation in allowing for an active role of financiers and providing an analysis
of various tax policy initiatives. We propose a stylized general equilibrium
model of entrepreneurship and venture capital, featuring two sectors: one
producing ‘traditional’ goods and another entrepreneurial sector where an
‘innovative’ good is produced with an inherently risky technology, and where
informational problems loom large. The model conforms well with some important stylized facts of venture capital finance.4 Financiers provide start-up

finance in exchange for an equity share. The typical arrangement consists of
a low base salary combined with profit participation. In financing a portfolio of companies, venture capital funds are able to diversify risk and could,
in principle, fully insure the entrepreneur. Risk diversification, however, is
limited by the extent of moral hazard in the relation between entrepreneur
and financier. The equity contract must thus be structured to retain the
entrepreneur’s full committment and eﬀort in the face of a moral hazard
problem that results from entrepreneurial eﬀort being non-observable and
non-verifiable. While the entrepreneur’s eﬀort certainly is critical for the
venture to have any positive survival chance at all, the financier also contributes with valuable business advice to further enhance survival rates.5
Apart from solving incentive problems with respect to entrepreneurial
eﬀort, the venture capital contract must be suﬃciently generous to attract
5

In focusing on the advisory activity and tax incentives, the paper obviously neglects

other important aspects of venture capital finance such as two-sided moral hazard between
entrepreneurs and venture capital firms [e.g. Repullo and Suarez (1998)], or stage financing
and convertible debt [e.g. Cornelli and Yosha (1997)]. Venture capital firms are also
intensively screening projects. The eﬀects of taxes in such a context are discussed in the
above mentioned literature on investment with adverse selection, although the intensity
of screening is usually not considered.

entrepreneurs in the presence of alternative career opportunities. Agents may
either go for a safe worker’s salary in the traditional sector or opt for an entrepreneurial career with potentially high rewards but high risk as well. The
equilibrium solution with occupational choice splits the population into entrepreneurs, consultants and workers and endogenously determines the quality of venture capital finance (i.e. the extent of managerial advice). We then
investigate the eﬀects of a broad range of tax instruments such as diﬀerential wage and corporate income taxes, progressive taxation, incomplete loss
oﬀsets, an investment subsidy and an output subsidy to portfolio companies.
The paper now proceeds with presenting the model in section 2. Section 3
discusses the eﬀects of proportional taxes on the equilibrium level of managerial advice and venture capital backed start-up investment. Section 4
addresses the welfare implications of policy. Section 5 considers incomplete
loss oﬀset and progressive taxation. Section 6 summarizes and discusses future research.

The Model

2.1

Definitions

Overview: The economy consists of two sectors, producing ‘traditional’
and ‘innovative’ goods, respectively. A deterministic Ricardian technology is
available for production of the traditional good with one unit of labor yielding
one unit of output. Choosing the standard good as a numeraire, its price
and the wage rate are both equal to one. Innovative goods result from an
entrepreneurial activity which is inherently risky and requires a fixed start-up
investment on top of the entrepreneur’s input. Each entrepreneur pursues
exactly one venture that yields one unit of output with probability p and
nothing with probability 1 − p. Projects will fail with certainty, however, if
entrepreneurs choose not to devote full eﬀort and attention to their venture.
Households are risk averse and choose to become workers or entrepreneurs.
Since entrepreneurs pursue only one project, they face an undiversifiable income risk. No income accrues if the venture fails. In face of this existential
income risk, entrepreneurial activity can emerge only if financial intermediation provides suﬃcient insurance. Assuming project risks to be stochastically
6

independent, financiers are able to partially insure entrepreneurs by financing
a diversified portfolio of projects. By the law of large numbers, the aggregate
economy is free of risk.

Risk, Eﬀort and Advice: Survival probability p is assumed to depend
on eﬀort e which cannot be verified and contracted by an outside investor.
A minimum amount 0 < δ < 1 of the entrepreneur’s time input is freely
observable. Only the rest of time 1 − δ is under discretion and is assumed
not to be observable by outsiders. High eﬀort means that, in addition to the
basic activity δ, the entrepreneur also devotes 1 − δ of her time exclusively to
the venture. Low eﬀort or shirking means that it is directed to some lucrative
outside activity. Only high eﬀort implies a positive survival chance p > 0,
while low eﬀort results in business failure for sure, p = 0. We suppress the
eﬀort variable in the probability p, knowing that it is positive only if the
entrepreneur supplies high eﬀort. In addition to the entrepreneur’s eﬀort,
we also postulate a productive contribution of the VC consisting of some

managerial services a:6
p = p (a) ,

p0 > 0 > p00 ,

p (0) = p0 > 0,

lim p (a) < 1.

a→∞

(1)

Taxation of Portfolio Company: A corporate income tax (CIT) at rate
τ and an output subsidy of σ to innovative goods give an expected net income
of the portfolio company equal to
(1 − τ ) (pQ(1 + σ) − b) − (1 − z) K,
where Q is the consumer price of innovative goods. Profits are reduced by
the entrepreneur’s base salary b. Setting up a business also requires a fixed
start-up investment K, part of which is subsidized with an investment tax
credit at rate z. Investment demand is for traditional goods. In case of
business failure, the company runs up a loss equal to the base salary and the
start-up investment cost net of taxes. At this stage, we assume that VCs can
oﬀset any losses against income from successful projects.

Taxation of Venture Capitalist: Entrepreneurs have no funds of their
own. To get the firm started, the VC must thus inject equity in the amount
6

We use p0 as a short-hand for dp/da.

8

of I = (1 − τ ) b+(1 − z) K, which is in exchange for a share 1−s of the company’s cash flow. The VC earns gross revenues (1 − s) Q (1 + σ) and pays
CIT on her own expected operating profits equal to τ [(1 − s) (1 + σ) pQ − a]
where equity purchases equal to I are not deductible. VC firms hire a ‘consultants’ per project to supply business advice. Note that the VC calculates
with expected profits because she is assumed to hold a diversified portfolio
of start-up companies that eliminates all income risk on her part. For each
project, her expected, net of tax profit is
Π = (1 − τ ) [(1 − s) pQ (1 + σ) − b − a] − (1 − z) K.

(2)

The entrepreneur’s income directly subtracts from the amount of income that
may possibly be claimed by the VC. The expected cost of entrepreneurial
compensation to the VC is
c = (1 − τ ) [spQ (1 + σ) + b] .

(3)

It will prove useful to write expected, net profits of the VC firm as
Π = (1 − τ ) [pQ (1 + σ) − a] − (1 − z) K − c.

(4)

Taxation of Entrepreneur: Apart from a base salary b, the entrepreneur
receives income from her equity share s in the company. Suppose, for sim9

plicity, that the CIT rate τ is equal to the personal tax rate on capital
income. There is no further tax burden at the individual level. The entrepreneur’s base salary, however, is subject to a wage tax at rate t. Expected
entrepreneurial income net of taxes thus amounts to
cN = s (1 − τ ) pQ (1 + σ) + (1 − t) b.

(5)

Demand: Agent i with income Yi consumes quantities Ci and Di of traditional and innovative goods, respectively. Demand derives from utility maximization subject to a budget constraint, (Ci + QDi ) (1 + v) ≤ Yi , where v
is the rate of a uniform consumption tax. Being endowed with preferences
u = ln (u0 · C α D1−α ), where u0 = α−α (1 − α)−(1−α) for convenience, agents
spend
(1 + v) Ci = αYi ,

(1 + v) QDi = (1 − α) Yi ,

¤
£
Vi = ln Yi −ln (1 + v) Q1−α .
(6)

Indirect utility Vi is concave in disposable income Yi . The logarithmic specification of utility implies constant relative risk aversion equal to unity.

Labor Allocation: Given our technological assumptions, and with L denoting the number of workers and E the number of entrepreneurs, the supply
10

of traditional goods is L and that of innovative goods S = pE. Apart from
the entrepreneurial input, production of the innovative good is enhanced by
managerial advice which requires aE consultants in total. The production
possibilities are thus traced out by an allocation of labor satisfying the resource constraint. Given a population of mass one, labor market clearing
requires
1 = L + (1 + a) E.

(7)

Income: All agents potentially receive profits Πi from ownership of VC
firms which will be zero, however, in equilibrium with free entry. Apart from
this, individual disposable income depends on the agent’s occupation. A
worker obtains a safe salary equal to the wage rate net of the wage tax t, i.e.
Yi = 1 − t + Πi .7 The entrepreneur’s income is risky and equal to cN + Πi in
expected value. Given symmetry within each occupational group, aggregate
disposable income is8

Profits from VC firms are 0 Πi di = ΠE but will be zero in equilibrium with free

11

The aggregate budget constraint reads (C + QD)(1 + v) = Y .

Public Sector: The government collects taxes and hands out subsidies.
Any net revenue is rebated as a consumption subsidy. It will become apparent
that a proportional consumption subsidy with a uniform rate is neutral and,
thus, allows to isolate the allocative eﬀects of other distortive taxes.9 The
government budget constraint is
τ (pQ (1 + σ) − b − a) E + t (L + (b + a) E) + v (C + QD) = σQpE + zKE.
(9)
Apart from the salaries of L workers, both the base salary b of each entrepreneur and the wage income of aE consultants are liable to the wage tax
at rate t. While tax revenue from each project is risky, the government’s
revenue is deterministic since the law of large numbers consolidates stochastically independent risks.

Market Clearing: Commodity market clearing requires
C + KE = L,
9

D = pE.

(10)

Lump-sum per capita transfers, in contrast, are not neutral because they aﬀect the

incentive compatible provisions of the equity contract. They are introduced in section 5.

12

Using (2), (5), (9), and (10), disposable income in (8) is also written as
Y = (1 + v) (QpE + L − KE) .

(11)

To verify Walras’ Law, substitute the budget constraint (C + QD) (1 + v) =
Y into (11) and get (C + KE − L) + Q (D − pE) = 0. The sum of valued
excess demands is zero.

2.2.1

Venture Capital Activity
Incentive Contract

The following sequence of events determines individual decision making. Occupational choice comes first. Workers receive a safe wage, set their consumption levels and derive utility as in (6). If agents opt for an entrepreneurial
career, they approach a VC to fund their project. An equity share and base
salary is negotiated, and the VC promises to support the venture with a verifyable level of advice. Given the contractional arrangement, the entrepreneur
chooses eﬀort and the VC supplies managerial advice. Next, risk is resolved
and state-dependent income determined. Knowing income, consumption and
welfare of entrepreneurs is given by (6).
13

The VC buys an equity stake 1 − s at a cost I that covers both the
entrepreneur’s base salary b and the fixed start-up investment K. The remuneration of entrepreneurs is optimally specified in a venture capital contract
and must provide suﬃcient incentives for their participation and eﬀort. To
maximize profits in (4), the VC chooses s and b as well as a level of advice
a. Her maximization problem is conveniently decomposed into two stages.
For any given level of advice, she first minimizes the cost c of obtaining the
entrepreneur’s participation. Knowing how contract cost depends on advice,
she then chooses a to maximize profits. The second stage of profit maximization is taken up in the next subsection.
In contracting with the entrepreneur (agent), the VC (principal) structures the terms of the contract to solve the incentive problems arising from
asymmetric information. Given the entrepreneur’s other job opportunities,
the contract must be generous enough to secure her participation. For this
reason, the contract cost in part reflects the foregone alternative income
such as a worker’s safe salary equal to net wages,10 Yi = 1 − t. To retain survival chances of start-ups, remuneration of entrepreneurs must also provide
10

From now on, we set Πi = 0. Profits are zero in the competitive VC sector with free

entry.

14

suﬃcient incentives for high eﬀort. However, the contract cannot be made
contingent on non-verifiable eﬀort, but only on freely observable outcome.
If eﬀort is high, the VC thus concedes a gross income to the entrepreneur
equal to sQ(1 + σ) + b if the venture succeeds but only b if it fails, where b
is a safe, but moderate base salary. If the entrepreneur shirks, the business
always fails. In this case the entrepreneur is left with the base salary b only,
but may reap some outside wage from tacitly working 1 − δ of her time in
manufacturing, giving b + 1 − δ in total. With taxes, the entrepreneur’s net
income is lower. A proportional wage tax at rate t is subtracted from all
sources of wage income while the CIT cuts into profit income. Defining
θ ≡ s (1 − τ ) Q(1 + σ),

β ≡ (1 − t) b,

(12)

the entrepreneur receives an expected income of cN = pθ + β net of CIT and
personal wage taxes if eﬀort is high. The expected net cost to the VC is
c = pθ + (1 − τ ) b and may diﬀer from cN because of taxes. Since the base
salary is deductible from the CIT, the eﬀective cost to the VC is (1 − τ ) b
while the entrepreneur receives (1 − t) b. The problem of the VC is now to

15

obtain the venture at minimum cost,11
c = minθ,b pθ + (1 − τ ) b

s.t.

P C : p ln (θ + β) + (1 − p) ln (β) ≥ ln (1 − t) ,

(13)

IC : p ln (θ + β) + (1 − p) ln (β) ≥ ln (β + (1 − δ) (1 − t)) .
The contract must specify profit participation and base salary such that
both the participation (PC) and incentive compatibility (IC) constraints are
satisfied. The PC compares expected utility derived from entrepreneurship
with utility from a safe worker’s salary. The IC is fulfilled if expected utility
from supplying high eﬀort is no lower than utility from shirking. Given that
the VC cannot observe shirking, the base salary must be paid in all cases.
Income from shirking thus consists of the base salary plus any outside income
that the entrepreneur would derive from working 1−δ of her time somewhere
else.
As a benchmark, we first consider the full information case. When the
principal can costlessly verify eﬀort, the contract may be conditioned on
11

Given indirect utility as in (6), the constraints should take into account the logarithm

of the consumer price index, − ln(1 + v) − (1 − α) ln Q. These terms, however, cancel out
on each side. The consumption tax — and indeed the CPI — are neutral with respect to
the contract! Only net income flows matter.

16

eﬀort without any incentive problems. Since the principal holds a fully diversified portfolio of companies while the risk-averse agent pursues a single project only, it is eﬃcient to provide insurance. The PC requires θ =
¡
¢
(1 − t) b b−1/p − 1 . Minimizing cost then gives an optimality condition

£
¤
1 − τ = (1 − t) p + (1 − p) b−1/p . The VC’s marginal cost of raising the
base salary is 1 − τ while the other side gives the savings from reducing the

entrepreneur’s profit participation in return. Only if tax rates are equal do
we have full insurance with a base salary equal to gross wages (b = 1) and a
zero profit share (θ = 0). However, if tax rates diﬀer, entrepreneurs and VCs
no longer agree on the value of safe income. If the wage tax rate exceeds the
CIT rate, the VC will shift some risk to the entrepreneur even in the absence
of incentive problems, because the VC’s eﬀective cost of providing a safe
salary exceeds the amount that the entrepreneur obtains net of taxes. Put
diﬀerently, the entrepreneur prefers low taxed profit income over high taxed
wage income and will accept some risk in exchange for the tax advantage. In
Figure 1, the slopes of the PC and the cost line diﬀer at the full insurance
point.
With asymmetric information, both constraints are binding whence we

17

obtain the solution by computing the intersection of them. Figure 1 illustrates. Moving away from full insurance along the PC, the reduction of the
base salary must be compensated by ever higher profit shares such that expected income exceeds the safe alternative by a premium to reward for risk
bearing. If τ = t, we have c = cN , and expected income cN from the equity contract exceeds the net wage of a worker by the risk premium. For
an analytical solution, substitute the definition of β and get ln (1 − t) =
ln [β + (1 − δ) (1 − t)] or b = δ. The PC then gives 1 − t = (θ + β)p β 1−p , or

We note some immediate implications for tax incidence. The base salary
just compensates for the opportunity cost in terms of foregone wages of the
entrepreneur’s basic time input δ and is exogenous. For a given survival rate
p, the entrepreneur’s profit income θ depends only on the base salary net of
the wage tax. Since θ = s (1 − τ ) Q(1+σ), the CIT is thus fully shifted to the
VC while the entrepreneur is compensated by an increase in the profit share
to obtain the same overall income in case of success. Similarly, the output
subsidy σ fully accrues to the VC while the entrepreneur is able to capture

18

not even part of it. In contrast, a higher wage tax reduces the alternative
income and allows the VC, ceteris paribus, to cut the entrepreneur’s profit
share and still retain her participation and high eﬀort. The burden of the
wage tax lies as much with entrepreneurs as with workers. In equilibrium,
however, the survival rate is endogenously determined which will then aﬀect
the described pattern of tax shifting.
The overall contract cost that the VC must incur to attract the entrepreneur determines her residual expected income and willingness to invest.
It depends on taxes. In raising survival chances p (a) through more intensive
managerial advice, the VC herself may control the cost. Appendix A proves
the following properties:

Proposition 1 (Cost of Contract) The cost c (p; τ, t) = pθ + (1 − τ ) b of

There are two oﬀsetting influences of p on cost. On the one hand, a
higher survival rate raises cost since high income must be paid with higher
probability. On the other hand, when project risk declines, the principal
19

may ensure participation of the entrepreneur with a smaller risk premium.
The VC is therefore able to squeeze the entrepreneur’s profit share in the
successful state,

∂θ
∂p

< 0. The second eﬀect dominates and marginal cost

falls. Furthermore, the cost function is unambiguously convex in the survival
rate. The wage tax allows to cut the entrepreneur’s profit share and, thereby,
reduces the VC’s contract cost since it makes the alternative career option
less attractive. The CIT also squeezes cost. Since the base salary is tax
deductible in the portfolio company, the government eﬀectively pays for part
of it. Note finally that contract cost is completely independent of the output
subsidy σ to innovative goods. The subsidy boosts the company’s cash flow
in case of success but the VC simply cuts the profit share and appropriates
all of it.

2.2.2

Managerial Advice

Only successfully launched businesses eventually contribute to the VC’s revenues. According to (1), however, VCs may themselves contribute to higher
survival chances of their portfolio companies and strengthen their revenues
by giving business advice. In raising the survival rate, more advice also allows

20

to squeeze the entrepreneur’s risk premium over safe wage income by making
entrepreneurial income more certain, whence the venture may be obtained
at a lower contract cost. Advice, however, is costly and results in operating
costs gross of taxes equal to a per project. The profit maximizing level of
advice is most easily analyzed by rewriting (4) as
Π = max p [(1 − τ ) Q(1 + σ) − m] ,
a

m≡

c (p; t, τ ) + (1 − τ ) a + (1 − z) K
.
p
(15)

We refer to m as cost to market which is the expected cost incurred in order
to produce one unit of the innovative good. On average, one must start 1/p
projects to accomplish this. Apart from savings in contract cost, an increase
in the survival rate now reduces cost to market because a smaller number
of projects need to be started for each successful one. The necessary and
suﬃcient conditions for the VC’s advisory activity are, thus,12

2.3

Equilibrium

Zero Profits and Managerial Advice: As long as they make additional
profits, VCs attract ever more entrepreneurs E and generate more business
start-ups. In equilibrium, the price of innovative goods must satisfy the zero
profit condition relating to (15),
(1 − τ ) Q (1 + σ) = m.

(17)

With free entry and zero profits, the cost m of bringing a venture to the
market must be equal to the producer price net of the CIT. The intensity of
managerial advice and the equilibrium market price are solved recursively.
Imposing the zero profit condition (17) on the individual optimality condition
of the VC in (16) gives
Π0 = −pm0 = p0 (m − c0 ) − (1 − τ ) = 0,

(18)

where c depends on a only via its eﬀect on p. With taxes given, this equation
autonomously fixes the level of managerial advice. In equilibrium, the VC’s
22

marginal benefit of supplying more advice is p0 (m − c0 ). More advice boosts
survival rates which directly reduces cost to market, and does so indirectly
as well, since a lower risk allows to cut the profit share of the entrepreneur.
In providing more advice, the VC incurs a marginal cost equal to 1 − τ . Once
the level of advice is known, p, c, and m are determined which, in turn, fixes
the demand price Q according to (17).

Number of Entrepreneurs: We impose labor market clearing and budget constraints and solve for the number of entrepreneurs that equilibrate
the market for innovative goods. Walras’ Law then implies market clearing
for standard goods as well. Given neutrality of the consumption tax, equilibrium will be independent of its rate. We start with the observation in (6)
that agents spend a fixed share of disposable income (1 + v) (C + QD) = Y
on innovative goods. Spending is thus QD =

(1−α)Y
1+v

= (1 − α) Y G where

Y G ≡ C + QD = Y − v (C + QD) denotes gross factor income.13 Before
we equate demand and supply, we compute gross income by replacing the
consumption subsidy from the government budget in (9). Using (8), (7),
13

To rebate tax revenues, the government gives a consumption subsidy, i.e. v < 0. A

consumption tax is charged only when an output or investment subsidy must be financed.

23

(5) and (12), disposable income is Y = [pθ + (1 − t) b] E + (1 − t) (1 − E)
where the zero profit condition, by way of (15) and (13), implies pθE =
[(1 − τ ) (pQ(1 + σ) − a − b) − (1 − z) K] E. Taking vY G from (9) and replacing L from (7), gross income emerges as
Y G = Y − vY G = 1 + pQE − (1 + a + K) E.
Equate supply and demand in the entrepreneurial sector, pE = (1 − α) Y G /Q.
Note in particular that in zero profit equilibrium, managerial advice, survival
probability, contract cost c and cost to market m are all autonomously determined by (18) independently from the rest of the model. Figure 2 illustrates
the solution for the untaxed equilibrium with the number of entrepreneurs being the equilibrating variable. In this case, gross income is Y G = 1+(c − 1) E.
A part (1 − α) /Q of demand is autonomous but it increases with E for the
simple reason that average income of entrepreneurs exceeds wages by a risk
premium c − 1. The demand schedule is flatter than the supply curve such
that the equilibrium number of entrepreneurs given by the intersection is
smaller than unity. By the zero profit condition (17), the number of entrepreneurs is E =

1−α
1−α+a+K+αc

< 1. By the same steps, entrepreneurship in

Cost to Market

The recursive structure of the model greately simplifies policy analysis. Cost
to market and managerial advice may be solved independently of the rest of
the model. Note that (18) is equivalent to m0 = 0 which is also the condition
for minimum cost to market m = mina

Imposing zero profits on (16), the necessary and suﬃcient conditions of the two prob-

lems are related according to Π0 = −pm0 = 0 and Π00 = −pm00 < 0 whence the cost
function m is indeed convex.

25

Wage taxation allows to cut entrepreneurial compensation since it reduces
alternative income. Wage taxes thus reduce cost to market and boost profits
of VC firms. They start to attract more entrepreneurs and will bring more
start-up companies to market. The market price falls until, in equilibrium,
profits are sqeezed to zero again and no more projects are funded. Because
the base salary and advisory costs are tax deductible, the CIT eﬀectively
subsidizes these expenditures and reduces cost to market as well. A subsidy
z to start-up investment similarly reduces cost to market. An output subsidy
is unable to aﬀect cost to market and, thereby, the zero profit producer price.
It is completely passed on to consumers by reducing their demand price Q.

3.2

Managerial Advice

VCs not only provide equity finance but also supply valuable business advice.
Do taxes impair incentives to provide managerial advice? Condition (18)
implicitly determines the extent of consulting when market entry is free and
competition eliminates profits in VC finance. Taking the diﬀerential thereof
shows how policy induces VCs to adjust advice in equilibrium. Using the

where the elasticity µ is defined in (A.2). Henceforth, we use r to denote
a comprehensive income tax, i.e. r = t = τ = z. With signs determined
in (B.2), the equilibrium eﬀects of taxation on incentives to give advice are
summarized as

Proposition 2 (Managerial Advice) In equilibrium with free entry, the
intensity of managerial advice increases with a higher corporate income tax,
while a higher investment subsidy and higher wage taxes discourage advice.

(21)

The CIT seemingly holds ambiguous incentives for advice. As indicated by
(15) and (18), the marginal benefit p0 (m − c0 ) of giving more advice is a
higher survival rate which saves costs, since fewer projects need to be started
for each successful one. On the one hand, a higher CIT reduces the marginal
benefit of business advice by p0 ∂m
= − (a + b) p0 /p. When start-up cost
∂τ
becomes smaller due to the implicit tax subsidy associated with a higher CIT
27

rate, then less is saved by raising the survival rate and the marginal benefit of
advice declines accordingly. On the other hand, since advisory costs are tax
deductible, a higher CIT rate reduces the marginal cost of advice by −dτ
and thereby encourages managerial support. The net eﬀect is positive.15
Via the eﬀect on managerial advice, the CIT tends to strengthen survival
chances of new start-ups. A comprehensive income tax avoids interfering
with VCs’ incentives since it aﬀects marginal benefits and costs of advice
proportionately.

3.3

Entrepreneurship

With an endogenous survival rate, the number of entrepreneurs E willing to
start up new projects is no longer proportional to and must be distinguished
from the number of successful projects pE. How then is tax policy aﬀecting
entrepreneurship and supply in the innovative sector? The quality of VC
finance, i.e. the intensity of consulting, determines entrepreneurial risk and
thereby aﬀects agents’ willingness to opt for an entrepreneurial career. Are
15

Since x ≡ 1 − (a + b) p0 /p > 0 as shown in (B.2) of the appendix, the eﬀect of the CIT

is positive,

28

tax incentives for advice in line with the tax eﬀects on occupational choice?
To build intuition, consider first the market for innovative goods in the untaxed equilibrium which is p (a) E = (1 − α) [1 + (c − 1) E] /m with Q = m
by the zero profit condition. In holding a constant, we identify some direct
eﬀects of taxes on the demand side. For a given number of entrepreneurs,
taxes contribute to aggregate income and boost demand if they raise the
risk premium, i.e. the income diﬀerential, of entrepreneurs. This income
eﬀect is enhanced by a price eﬀect if taxes reduce cost to market and thus
allow for a lower demand price. To eliminate excess demand, the number of
entrepreneurs must increase. The indirect eﬀect of taxes works through incentives for managerial advice. More intensive advice boosts survival chances
and adds to aggregate supply when a larger fraction of start-up projects is
successful. In reducing risk, more advice squeezes the income premium of entrepreneurs and erodes demand. Note also that a marginal increase in advice
fails to aﬀect the output price since m0 = 0. If taxes encourage more intensive
advice, they contribute to excess supply of innovative goods. The number of
entrepreneurs must decline to restore equilibrium. With these transmission
channels in mind, we now consider how various taxes aﬀect entrepreneurship
and industry supply.
29

Wage Tax: In the general case, we start from a taxed equilibrium. Take the

As a direct eﬀect, the wage tax reduces cost to market and thereby strengthens demand by means of a lower output price. On the other hand, lower net
wages render the entrepreneur’s alternative career option less attractive. The
VC is thus able to save on entrepreneurial compensation which reduces demand. The price eﬀect is seen to dominate, and VCs will fund more projects
and attract more entrepreneurs to restore equilibrium. The second term in
the curly bracket is an indirect eﬀect of the wage tax that stems from the
diminished incentives for managerial advice, see (21). Less intensive advice
contributes to excess demand and further stimulates entrepreneurship.
A higher wage tax entices more start-ups but each one receives less advice
from VCs and is, thus, less likely to succeed. What is then the net eﬀect
on pE, the supply of innovative goods? Using (22) and introducing Ψ =
1 − α − pEΦ/p0 , we obtain

[pQ − (1 + a + K)] > 0. The condition holds in the untaxed equilibrium
where pQ = pm = c + a + K. In this case, pQ − (1 + a + K) = c − 1 > 0
is equal to the risk premium. By continuity, the condition will be satisfied
as long as tax rates are not too large. With a comprehensive income tax
and a zero output subsidy, i.e. t = τ = z > 0 and σ = 0, the condition
is again related to the entrepreneur’s risk premium, [pQ − (1 + a + K)] =

the inequality 1 − α < EpQ thus established, the first two terms in Ψ are
negative and the third one is negative anyway. With Ψ < 0, the wage tax
is seen to boost output of innovative goods. The fact that the wage tax
discourages consulting, reinforces the direct eﬀects on entrepreneurship and
aggregate supply.

An increase in the investment subsidy leads to a rise in both the number of
entrepreneurs and of successful projects. It lowers cost to market of innovative goods which expands supply and attracts additional entrepreneurs. In
discouraging VC advice, the subsidy reinforces both the number of start-ups
and aggregate supply and thereby expands the entrepreneurial sector. The
CIT has opposite eﬀects. It lowers cost to market as well. However, since
it hits revenues even more forcefully, the relative market price of innovative
goods is higher which reduces output and demand for entrepreneurs.

Comprehensive Income Tax: A comprehensive income tax features common rates for the wage tax t, the CIT τ , and the investment subsidy z. A
comprehensive income tax was shown to be neutral with respect to the level
of managerial advice. It turns out that this broad-based tax with full loss
oﬀset neither aﬀects entrepreneurship nor the supply of innovative goods.
In (19), the direct eﬀect of the tax would enter through m/ (1 − r) but the
32

tax factor cancels out since all terms in m including θ as given in (14) are
proportional to (1 − r). Consequently,

Output Subsidy: In zero profit equilibrium with free entry of VCs, an
output subsidy σ avoids to distort incentives for advice. It aﬀects neither

entrepreneurship and aggregate supply,

Proposition 3 (Entrepreneurship) A wage tax, an investment subsidy

The CIT works in the opposite direction. A comprehensive income tax with
full loss oﬀset is neutral.

Welfare

Tax policy aﬀects the incentives of VCs to advise entrepreneurs and thereby
influences the survival rates of start-up businesses. It also aﬀects the propensity of households to opt for an entrepreneurial career. What are the normative implications of tax policy from a welfare theoretic point of view? The
main complication compared to a standard competitive economy is the presence of asymmetric information in the relation between entrepreneurs and
financiers. To avoid moral hazard and to retain survival chances of startup ventures, the equity contract must be arranged to provide entrepreneurs
with powerful incentives for full eﬀort. For this reason, entrepreneurs must
bear risk via profit participation even though full risk diversification would
be possible in principle. In the presence of unconsolidated risk, taxation
could provide further insurance. It is expected, however, that further diversification is counterproductive since it conflicts with private arrangements to
contain moral hazard. We now proceed with an explicit welfare analysis to
check this conjecture.

34

The Welfare Measure: To investigate the welfare consequences of tax
policy, we analyze (ex ante) welfare of agents prior to occupational choice.16
Given a price index P = (1 + v) Q1−α , an agent with real income Yi /P derives
indirect utility Vi = ln (Yi /P ), see (6). In equilibrium, expected utility from
entrepreneurship is exactly matched by utility from a safe job in industry.
The participation constraint holds with equality. Therefore, utility Vi of a
worker which depends on the after tax real wage (1 − t) /P , is a complete
welfare measure.17 The marginal welfare eﬀect is, thus,
dV = −

dv
dQ
dt
−
− (1 − α)
.
1−t 1+v
Q

(27)

Welfare depends on the real wage net of taxes. Tax policy thus aﬀects welfare
via three channels: (i) the after-tax wage; (ii) the consumption tax; and (iii)
the price of innovative goods. The wage tax determines (i) while (ii) and
16

Boadway et al. (1991) provide a welfare analysis in several models of occupational

choice.
17

This ex ante welfare measure also corresponds to a social welfare function which

adds up ex post utility levels of diﬀerent agents.

The population splits into 1 − E

workers and E entrepreneurs of whom pE are successful and (1 − p) E fail. Given net
income Yi ∈ {1 − t, θ + β, β}, social welfare amounts to SW F = (1 − E) · V ( 1−t
P ) +
β
pE · V ( θ+β
P ) + (1 − p) E · V ( P ). Since the participation constraint binds with equality,
β
1−t
1−t
pV ( θ+β
P ) + (1 − p) V ( P ) = V ( P ), social welfare is again given by V = ln( P ).

35

(iii) reflect the price index. As indicated in (20), tax policy aﬀects the cost
to market m and, thereby, the price Q = m/[(1 − τ )(1 + σ)] which obtains
under perfect competition and free entry of VCs. In particular, the welfare
evaluation of taxes must take account of the fact that revenues are rebated
by means of a consumption subsidy.
As a first step in evaluating (27), we compute the diﬀerential of the government budget constraint to obtain the adjustment in the consumption subsidy. For the rest of this section, we start from an untaxed equilibrium position and derive the marginal welfare eﬀects of introducing small taxes from
zero. This way, we avoid complicated tax base eﬀects that would identify the
excess burden of taxes. With small taxes, the excess burden is zero to the
first order. The remaining welfare eﬀect must then be due to other distortions if there are any. The diﬀerential of the public budget constraint in (9)
is
Y dv = − [1 − (1 − b) E] dt − (pθ + K) Edτ + KEdz + (1 − α) Y dσ. (28)
In the untaxed equilibrium, the tax base of the consumption subsidy is equal
to income Y = C + QD = 1 + (c − 1) E. By way of (7), the wage tax base
is L + (a + b) E = 1 − (1 − b) E. Using the zero profit condition Q = m plus
36

contract cost c = pθ + b, the corporate tax base is pQ − b − a = pθ + K.

Marginal Taxes and Subsidies: We start with the introduction of a
small wage tax that generates revenues Y dv = − [1 − (1 − b) E] dt. With
free entry, Q = m and, by (20), dQ/Q = −θ · dt/m. Substituting into the
welfare diﬀerential in (27), and using Y = 1 + (c − 1) E and c = pθ + b, we
find
dV
1 − (1 − b) E (1 − α) θ
(1 − α) Y θ − mpEθ

(29)

where the last equality exploits the conditions for zero profits and equilibrium
in the entrepreneurial sector, mpE = QD = (1 − α) Y . A small wage tax,
with revenues rebated by means of a neutral consumption subsidy, boosts
the number of entrepreneurs and supply of innovative goods, but it fails to
raise welfare at the margin. There is no market distortion that would require
a wage tax to correct private decisions. Starting again from the laissezfaire equilibrium, marginal changes in τ , z, and σ yield the same result [use
(20), (28), and the conditions for zero profits, Q = m/ [(1 − τ ) (1 + σ)], and
equilibrium in the innovative goods sector, mpE = (1 − α) Y ].

37

Proposition 4 (Welfare Eﬀects of Taxes) Using a proportional consumption tax or subsidy to balance the budget, and starting from an untaxed
equilibrium, the welfare eﬀects from a small wage tax, CIT, and small output
and investment subsidies are zero.

5

Extensions

Having discussed the major taxes being relevant for start-up investment by
risk-bearing entrepreneurs, we now proceed with two further scenarios. In
practice, tax systems are often restrictive to some extent in allowing VC funds
to oﬀset losses from failures against profits from successful start-ups. The
first subsection thus addresses the eﬀects on entrepreneurship, managerial
advice, and welfare when the income tax allows for less than full loss oﬀsets.
The second subsection turns to a redistributive policy that levies a proportional consumption tax in order to finance a uniform per capita transfer.
This scenario mimicks an indirectly progressive tax. Obviously, such transfers are relatively more important in case of failure when the entrepreneur
is left with a modest base salary only, as compared to the exceptionally
high income generated by a successful start-up. Such transfers provide wel38

come insurance to entrepreneurs. However, risk bearing and ex post income
inequality is required to contain the moral hazard problem. It will be important to investigate how such a redistributive tax transfer scheme interacts
with the financial arrangements of the VC contract.

Restricted Loss Oﬀsets: Consider an initial situation where a comprehensive income tax at rate r with full loss oﬀset is in place and revenues are
rebated by means of a proportional consumption subsidy at rate v < 0. All
other taxes and subsidies including lump-sum transfers are set to zero. The
loss oﬀset is relevant only for the VC since the portfolio company doesn’t
come into existence when the project fails. While government fully taxes
profits at rate r, VCs are denied to deduct a fraction ε of losses from their
tax liability with ε = 0 at the outset. We now consider the eﬀects of restricting full loss oﬀset by increasing ε. The income tax rate is kept constant but
the consumption subsidy adjusts to rebate any excess revenues.
The VC injects equity I = b + K gross of taxes for a share 1 − s of
prospective returns. The VC’s profit from a successful start-up is ΠG =
(1 − r) ((1 − s) Q − a − b − K) where I is borrowed and must be subtracted.
In case of failure, she incurs a loss ΠB = − (1 − (1 − ε) r) (a + b + K) since
39

only a fraction 1 − ε of losses can be oﬀset against dividends from other
projects. The VC’s expected, net of tax profit per project is thus Π =
pΠG + (1 − p) ΠB , or
Π = (1 − r) (1 − s) pQ−(1 − rγ) (a + b + K) ,

γ ≡ p+(1 − p) (1 − ε) ≤ 1.
(2’)

Full loss oﬀset is given by ε = 0 and γ = 1 which results in (2) again when
a comprehensive income tax with τ = t = z = r is in place and σ = 0.
Appendix C now repeats in Table C.1 all those elements of the basic model
that will change due to the presence of restricted loss oﬀset and lump-sum
transfers. The modified equations are primed.
In case of failure, the VC runs up losses of a+b+K which include her own
operating expenses for advice, the entrepreneur’s base salary, and the startup investment cost. When restricting loss oﬀset, the government fully taxes
profits from a successful start-up but participates relatively less in the loss
from project failure. Consequently, contract cost (13’) and cost to market
(15’) both increase when a larger share ε of losses are not tax deductible from
other revenues. Profit maximization with free entry and minimization of cost
to market are equivalent since they result in the same optimality condition
40

(18’). Applying the envelope theorem to m = mina

The square bracket in (18’) identifies the marginal benefit which stems from
an increase in the survival rate by p0 . The first part of the marginal benefit, p0 m, reflects the fact that a higher probability of success directly reduces cost to market. According to (20’), limiting loss oﬀset raises the
marginal benefit by p0 ∂m

. The second component −p0 c0 =

For reasons of space, we also include the eﬀects of transfers which are discussed below.

41

A higher survival chance not only squeezes the entrepreneur’s risk premium,
but also reduces the VC’s eﬀective contract cost of the base salary since a
higher survival rate makes the tax disadvantage from limited loss oﬀset hit
less likely. If the loss oﬀset is restricted further, the VC derives an even
higher marginal benefit from more advice which helps to avoid a larger tax
0

disadvantage. By (C.4), the marginal benefit increases by −p0 ∂c
= p0 rb. Fi∂ε
nally, part of marginal benefits stem from avoiding the tax disadvantage of
limited loss oﬀset for costs other than the base salary, p0 r (a + K) ε. By the
same reasoning, if a larger share ε of losses is not deductible, the VC again
faces higher incentives to avoid this tax disadvantage, and marginal benefit
of advice increases by p0 r (a + K). Adding up gives the second term in the
square bracket of (21’). Restricting loss oﬀset thus increases both marginal
benefits and marginal costs of advice such that the net eﬀect is ambiguous.
Restricting the loss oﬀset aﬀects entrepreneurship directly as well as indirectly by its implication for managerial advice. Using the optimality con0

By (20’), a restricted loss oﬀset raises the tax cost of VC operations and
inflates cost to market. By this direct eﬀect, government discourages entrepreneurship and start-up investment activity. As with all other scenarios,
the indirect eﬀect on managerial advice, if it is positive, will reinforce the
direct eﬀect and further discourage start-ups. Restricting loss oﬀset, however, may as well diminish incentives for managerial support and thereby
contribute to a larger number of start-ups, each one being more risky.
Output of the innovative sector is equal to the number of successful startups pE. Defining Ψ = 1 − α − pEΦ/p0 < 0,19 the net eﬀect of the loss oﬀset

To summarize, the direct eﬀect of restricting loss oﬀset, i.e. increasing ε, is to
discourage entrepreneurship and retard output of the entrepreneurial sector.
This is reinforced if the limitation of loss oﬀset induces more managerial
support. Fewer entrepreneurs are needed if each project succeeds with higher
probability. However, the relation between the generosity of loss oﬀset and
the extent of managerial advice is ambiguous.
Welfare depends on the disposable real wage. Keeping the income tax rate
constant, real wages change along with transfers and the consumer price index
as indicated in (C.6). By assumption, the government rebates tax revenues by
means of a neutral consumption subsidy. The required change in the subsidy
follows from the diﬀerential of the public budget (9’) which we usefully rewrite
as in (C.7). In analyzing the loss oﬀset, we start from a position of T = 0 and
γ = 1, implying

When a comprehensive income tax with full

loss oﬀset is in place, the initial equilibrium is free of distortions. A small
restriction of the loss oﬀset provision entails negligible welfare eﬀects that
are zero to the first order.

Proposition 5 (Restricted Loss Oﬀset) Starting with a comprehensive
income tax with full loss oﬀset, restricting the loss oﬀset provision raises
cost to market and, thereby, discourages entrepreneurship and industry output. However, it raises both marginal benefits and costs of managerial advice
20

In the transfer scenario, we suppress the income tax (r = 0), giving a budget T =

vY / (1 + v).

45

and creates ambiguous incentives for consulting and entrepreneurship. The
welfare eﬀect is zero to the first order.

Lump-Sum Transfers: When the government hands out uniform lumpsum transfers, cost to market falls according to (20’). The reasons are easily
explained in terms of figure 1. Since the disposable wage from a safe job
increases, transfers shift out the participation constraint while they do not
directly enter the incentive constraint. It is easily shown that the slope of the
incentive constraint is either negative or positive but less than unity. With
uniform per capita transfers, disposable income β in the bad state increases
one to one while income in the good state therefore rises less than one to one.
While the VC’s cost of the base salary remains unaﬀected by transfers, she
may save on the entrepreneur’s profit share θ. Alternatively, risk is reduced
if income in all states is increased by the same absolute amount, and risk
averse agents require a lower risk premium to compensate for entrepreneurial
risk bearing. Consequently, the cost of the contract to the VC falls which
translates into lower cost to market. For the same reasons, transfers reduce
marginal benefits of advice, p0 (m − c0 ), while marginal costs remain the same.
Consequently, transfers weaken the incentives to provide active consulting
46

services, see (21’). With lower cost to market, VCs expand their operations
and fund more projects until increased supply squeezes prices to restore zero
profits in equilibrium. Entrepreneurship and industry output in (30) and
(31) both increase. Since equity finance comes with less intensive advice,
however, business failure is more probable. More projects must be started to
expand the industry. The negative eﬀect on consulting reinforces the eﬀects
on entrepreneurship and industry supply.
By assumption, transfers are financed with a proportional consumption
tax. Substituting (32) into (C.6), the welfare eﬀect of a small transfer is

since Q = m with free entry and

sumption tax combined with uniform per capita transfers in fact mimicks a
progressive tax that redistributes from high to low incomes. The government
is thereby able to provide further insurance of unconsolidated risk associated
with entrepreneurial income. This yields a net welfare gain that is proportional to the risk premium c − 1. As taxation renders entrepreneurial income
less risky, entrepreneurs accordingly require a lower premium for risk bear47

ing. Financiers are thus able to attract entrepreneurs at a lower cost and at
the same time retain their incentives for full eﬀort. With free entry, lower
cost to market is passed on to consumers by cutting the price Q = m where

Proposition 6 (Progressive Taxation) Starting from an untaxed position, a redistributive tax transfer scheme (uniform per capita transfers financed with a proportional consumption tax) retards managerial advice but
boosts entrepreneurship and industry output. The tax transfer scheme reduces
unconsolidated risk and raises welfare.

The welfare gains from the redistributive tax transfer scheme are in
marked contrast to the proportional tax and subsidy scenarios of the preceding section. As Boadway et al. (1991) have demonstrated, welfare results
in models of occupational choice should generally reflect three components:
eﬃciency, equity and insurance. Given that the equity contract is optimal,
and with no other obvious distortions, decentralized equilibrium is eﬃcient
in our framework.21 Starting from an untaxed equilibrium, the first order
21

Given homothetic preferences, Vi = ln (ui ) with ui = u0 Ciα Di1−α , we can interpret

the subutility as consumption of a ‘final good’ in quantity ui . In allocating ui to workers

48

eﬃciency gains of government policy are therefore zero. There cannot be
any welfare gains on account of equity since all agents are identical ex ante.
The only source of first order welfare gains is, thus, social insurance in the
sense of Varian (1980). Boadway et al. (1991) further noted that the gains
from insurance actually stem from two components which are also reflected
in (34), namely a direct eﬀect from the tax transfer scheme, and an indirect
eﬀect from equilibrium price adjustment. Apart from the direct insurance
provided by the progressive consumption (income) tax, the induced price
reduction compresses the return on start-up investment and diminishes the
risk of entrepreneurial income. In the scenarios of the preceding sections,
and entrepreneurs, the planner faces the same constraints as in (13), and will therefore
allocate consumption of entrepreneurs to the two states as in figure 1. Private contracts
just replicate this allocation by means of an equity share cum base salary and are, thus,
optimal. Whenever a worker gets u units, expected consumption of an entrepreneur must
exceed it by a factor c(p). The social optimum is attained by maximizing the utility
of a worker, max ln (u), subject to four constraints. One cannot distribute more units of
final consumption than what is obtained from demanding the two goods, i.e. u0 C α D1−α ≥
u (1 − E)+c(p (a))uE. The other restrictions are the two commodity balances, p (a) E ≥ D
and L ≥ C + KE, and the labor constraint, 1 ≥ L + (1 + a) E. It can be shown that the
planning solution replicates the market allocation.

49

in contrast, the government balances the budget by means of a proportional
consumption tax and, thus, fails to provide any insurance. High income people pay high taxes but also receive a high consumption subsidy because they
have high consumption as well. For this reason, there cannot be any welfare
gains on account of social insurance in the preceding section.
To a large part, the public finance literature has dealt with the benefits
from social insurance by simply assuming the absence of private insurance
markets. In this paper, unconsolidated risk is an endogenous outcome of
the optimal decisions of financiers who could otherwise costlessly provide full
insurance. Entrepreneurial risk bearing is an essential part of venture capital
finance to retain incentives for high eﬀort in the face of a moral hazard
problem. It was not obvious a priori whether government should interfere
with private risk sharing arrangements by further consolidating risk. In the
light of proposition 6 we conjecture that the redistributive scheme yields
welfare gains from social insurance while the eﬃciency cost of doing so is
zero to the first order. However, as the scheme is expanded, it starts to
distort incentives for managerial advice ever more.
Proposition 6 also relates in a non-obvious way to existing studies on

50

entrepreneurship and insurance. Assuming absence of private risk sharing,
for reasons exogenous to his model, Kanbur (1980) finds that government
can raise welfare by taxing the risky occupation and subsidizing the safe
occupation which restricts entry into the risky activity. In the presence of
costly state verification and partial private insurance, Black and de Meza
(1997) find the opposite result that subsidizing entry into the risky occupation is welfare improving. In their case, government does not have superior
information over outcomes but can create collective insurance more cheaply
through its influence on equilibrium prices. Our analysis is in between. Since
expected income of entrepreneurs is higher than a worker’s income, our tax
subsidy scheme implies a net tax on risky activities, as in Kanbur but different from Black and de Meza. On the other hand, via its eﬀect on the
equilibrium price of the innovative good, the scheme encourages entry into
the risky occupation, as in Black and de Meza but diﬀerent from Kanbur.

Conclusions

Promoting entrepreneurship and business formation is widely recognized as
an important policy objective. Among others, the OECD has recently con51

cluded that entrepreneurial activity needs strengthening.22 The structure of
taxes, the operation of financial markets, and the “entrepreneurial climate”
are important policy areas. This paper proposed a model of entrepreneurship and start-up investment that emphasizes risk-bearing on the part of
entrepreneurs and its implications for occupational choice as well as the
‘quality of equity finance’. Even though financiers may, in principle, diversify project risk, some risk-bearing on the part of entrepreneurs is nevertheless required to contain a moral hazard problem in the relation between
VCs and entrepreneurs. Apart from structuring equity contracts, VCs also
supply valuable business advice to strengthen survival chances of their portfolio companies. We analyzed how tax policy might influence the propensity
for entrepreneurship as well as the incentives for managerial support by financiers. We found that a capital income tax strengthens incentives for
managerial advice but reduces the number of entrepreneurs while a wage tax
holds precisely opposite incentives. A broad based income tax is neutral on
all margins, distorting neither occupational choice nor incentives for business
advice. Output and investment subsidies to start-up firms both stimulate en22

The recent OECD country report on Austria, for example, includes a special feature

on promoting entrepreneurship and employment, see OECD (1999).

52

trepreneurial activity. Unfortunately, our static framework is not well suited
to analyze capital gains taxation. Since much of the income from venture
capital investments actually accrues in the form of capital gains, it seems
an important task for future research to address this issue in an enriched
intertemporal model.
One might argue that the government could raise welfare by further consolidating uninsured risks. Because of a moral hazard problem, however, private financiers intentionally abstain from oﬀering complete insurance even
though they could in principle do so by means of diversification. The entrepreneur’s profit share is intended to preserve incentives for eﬀort by making them bear part of the risk. Further consolidation by the government
could thus be counterproductive. Since government has no informational
advantage over private financiers, private risk sharing arrangements, and indeed the entire market allocation, are socially optimal in our framework.
Eﬃciency losses of taxes and transfers are therefore zero to a first order.
However, government may generate welfare gains from social insurance if it
introduces a small tax transfer scheme. Further expansion of redistributive
taxation would, however, increasingly impair eﬃciency by distorting equity

53

contracts and incentives for managerial advice. Future research might investigate the role of taxes and subsidies in situations where private contracts are
not necessarily optimal. Such cases might arise if there are more than two
states of nature, or eﬀort is continuous rather than discrete. Private agents
might then not have enough instruments available to achieve the optimal
risk sharing arrangement. One could also contemplate more traditional market distortions such as imperfect competition among VCs, or learning and
knowledge spillovers among them, to justify public policies other than redistributive taxation to promote entrepreneurship and venture capital finance.

Alternatively, one may verify that all terms in (18) turn out to be proportional to a common tax factor 1 − r, which cancels. Note in particular that
also θ is proportional to 1 − r which is obvious from (14).

C

Extensions: Table C.1 repeats those equations that change as a result

of the scenario analysed in section 5, and derives some intermediate results.
The primed equations must be compared with the basic model when a comprehensive income tax is in place, τ = t = z = r with σ = 0. Restricted loss
oﬀsets inflate cost c in (3’) because government takes over a smaller part of
losses. Lump-sum per capita transfers T are part of the individual income
and are thus included in disposable income in (8’). In computing the incentive compatible contract we obtain (14’) which collapses again to the basic
57

result in (14) for T = 0. Since ε does not enter the constraints in (13’), θ is
not aﬀected. To prove the eﬀect of T on θ, note that β = (1 − r) b + T with
b = δ fixed, and get the diﬀerential of (PC),

The program in (15’) determines optimal managerial advice. In equilibrium with free entry, the necessary condition is given by (18’). The reader
may easily verify that the suﬃcient condition (16’) surely holds if evaluated

first need the derivatives of marginal cost c0 . While θ and µ are independent
