ABSTRACT
Wages, labor market participation, hours worked, and savings differ by gender and marital status.
In addition, women and married people make up for a large fraction of the population and of
labor market participants, total hours worked, and total earnings. For the most part,
macroeconomists have been ignoring women and marriage in setting up structural models and by
calibrating them using data on males only. In this paper we ask whether ignoring gender and
marriage in both models and data implies that the resulting calibration matches well the key
economic aggregates. We find that it does not and we ask whether there are other calibration
strategies or relatively simple models of marriage that can improve the fit of the model to
aggregate data.

Introduction

Wages, labor market participation, hours worked, and savings differ by gender
and marital status. In addition, women and married people1 make up for a large
fraction of the population and of labor market participants, total hours worked, and
total earnings.
For the most part, macroeconomists have been ignoring women and marriage in
setting up life-cycle structural models and by calibrating them using data on males
only. In this paper we ask whether ignoring gender and marriage in both models and
data implies that the resulting calibration matches well the key economic aggregates
of labor participation, hours worked, labor income, and net worth. We find that it
does not and we ask whether there are other calibration strategies or relatively simple
models of marriage that can improve the model fit along these important dimensions.
To investigate the aggregate importance of gender and marriage and to determine
what might be the simplest model that best captures the most important aggregates, we construct and calibrate four different economies. Economy 1 is a “No
marriage, only men,” economy that adopts a standard one-gender, no marriage, lifecycle framework, and that only uses data on men for calibration purposes, as usually
done in quantitative macro models. We find that this model economy and calibration
misses the observed economy’s aggregate outcomes, including labor supply, earnings,
and hours by a large amount over all of the working period. More specifically, this
economy drastically overestimates participation by about 10-20 percentage points,
overestimates average hours by over one-third of actual aggregate hours, and also
overestimates average earnings by over one-third over the entire working period. It
also underestimates retirement savings.
Economy 2 is a “No marriage, men and women together” economy that uses the
same model as Economy 1 but is calibrated using data on both men and women
together, as individual-level data; thus ignoring any gender differences and whether
individuals are in couples or not. If this kind of “aggregation” were to match the aggregates well, this would be a possible way to take gender and marriage into account
without writing a more complicated model. The biggest success of this calibration
compared to Economy 1 is the match in labor earnings over the life cycle. Unfor1

We use the terms marriage and couples interchangeably. In the data work, we consider people
married or in couples if they are cohabiting and/or married.

2

tunately, however, this calibration still misses the observed patterns of participation
and hours over most of the life cycle, with the exception of the period between ages
45 and 55. For instance, at age 30, aggregate participation is about 80%, while the
model predicts close to 98%, and aggregate average hours are about 1,600 a year,
while the model predicts close to 2,000. In this case, too, the model underpredicts
retirement savings and generates faster asset decumulation after retirement than in
the data. These discrepancies hold even when we allow for an age-varying fixed cost
of participating in the labor market, calibrated to better match participation. This
calibration thus constitutes and improvement over Economy 1, but is still lacking in
many respects.
Economy 3 is a “No marriage, household-level calibration for couples only” economy that uses the same model as Economies 1 and 2, but in the calibration we
aggregate the data at the household level and we only keep couples. This is in contrast with Economies 1 and 2, in which we were only looking at individual-level data,
ignoring that some people are in couples and some others are not. We find that this
calibration has a similar fit to labor earnings, participation (performing better before
age 45 and worse after) and hours worked (fitting well only during during the age
40-55 ages) as Economy 2. Thus, if one wants to match avoid modeling marriage,
we conclude that it is best to adopt the calibration in Economies 2 or 3 and take
into account both gender and possibly household structure in the calibration. This
being said, this model, even with an improved calibration, still misses key aspects of
participation and labor supply over the life cycle.
Economy 4 is a “Marriage and singles, men and women” economy in which we
explicitly model married and single men and women over their whole life cycle. The
model is calibrated to the observed data for the four relevant groups: married men,
married women, and single men and single women. This model does much better than
all the other economies that we consider in matching the aggregate data. In terms
of discrepancies between the model aggregates and actual aggregates, Economy 4
tends to underpredict labor participation between ages 40 and 50 by less than 8
percentage points and tends to overpredict labor income by less than 3% over all of
the life cycle. Compared with the economies without two-agent couples and gender
differences, these misses are small. Thus, this comparison indicates that modelling
gender and marriage and the related economic incentives is important to understand
key economic aggregates over the life cycle.
3

Based on these findings, we thus conclude that even macroeconomists not interested in heterogeneity in marriage and gender per se should start taking marriage and
gender differences more seriously in the context of quantitative structural models. In
particular, modelling gender and marriage explicitly would yield the best results in
terms of matching the aggregates, but if this is not possible given the question and
complications at hand, calibrating (or estimating) the model including both men and
women in the data or keeping track of households to determine household-level wages
and hours (or earnings), participation, and assets will help the model better match
the aggregates.
Our paper provides two main contributions. First, it documents important aspects
of the data, both in the aggregate and over the life cycle, for single and married men
and women. Because marriage and female labor supply patterns have been changing
a lot over the last seventy years, we take our model to data from the Panel Study
and Income Dynamics (PSID) and the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) for the
1941-1945 cohort. In the aggregate, women and married people make up for a large
fraction of workers, hours, and earnings in the aggregate economy for our cohort of
interest. The fraction of workers who are women increases from 37% at age 25 to
44% at age 65. The fraction of hours worked by women as a fraction of total hours
rises from 28% at age 25 to 40% at age 65, while the fraction of earnings earned by
women raises from 24% at age 25 to 27% at age 65. Married people earn over 84%
of total earnings and contribute over 85% of the hours worked during the whole life
cycle of this cohort. Over the life cycle, we find that, for this cohort, married men
display on average the highest labor participation rate, over 98%, until they turn 40,
and only slowly decrease participation until age 50, while the participation of single
men starts dropping fast after age 40. The participation of single women is a shifted
down version of that of married men’s by about 10 percentage points. Married women
have an even lower participation, which is hump-shaped over the life cycle and peaks
at 50% around age 45. In addition, women not only are less likely to participate
in the labor market than men, but also display lower average hours conditional on
participation.
Second, besides considering a standard life cycle model, and calibrating it either
to males, or all people regardless of their gender, or to households, our paper also
constructs a structural and dynamic life cycle model that explicitly models single and
married men and women and calibrates it to both PSID and HRS data, and compares
4

the aggregate implications of all of our four models. We calibrate the parameters of
each model economy to match the observed data as well as possible for the relevant
group in consideration (as done by the previous literature) and we then investigate
how well each calibrated model can match the aggregate economy, which includes
single and married men and women.

Related literature

The vast majority of papers studying quantitative life-cycle macroeconomic questions uses data on males only. Notable exceptions to this include Tertilt (2005), that
studies the effects of marriage institutions (and polygyny more specifically) on aggregate output, and Doepke and Tertilt (2016), that advocates modeling the family
and gender to understand various historical changes, both in the short and the long
run. Our paper focuses on gender and marriage for the purposes of understanding
the economy’s aggregates at a point in time, using U.S. data for one cohort.
Our work builds on two main branches of the literature. One such branch studies
the determinants of life cycle female labor supply, typically assuming that male labor
supply is fixed and sometimes abstracting from savings. Attanasio et al. (2008) and
Eckstein and Lifshitz (2011) point to the importance of changing wages and child
care costs to explain increases in female labor supply over time. Guner, Kaygusuz
and Ventura (2012) find that gender-based taxes implying that women face lower and
proportional income tax rates increase output and female labor participation, and that
they improve welfare. Kaygusuz (2012) studies the effects of the Economic Recovery
Tax Act of 1981 on married female labor force participation. Nishiyama (2015) finds
that removing spousal and Social Security survivor benefits would increase female
labor participation, female hours worked, and aggregate output. Low et al. (2016)
study how marriage, divorce, and female labor supply are affected by welfare programs
in the U.S. Blundell et al. (2016) study how the U.K. tax and welfare system affects
the career of women. Compared to this set of papers, we allow for savings and both
intensive and extensive labor supply decisions for both men and women, and we
take our model to data by using the PSID and the HRS. In addition, we study the
implications of gender and marriage on the economy’s main aggregates by using a set
of models that take different stances on marriage and gender.
Another branch of the literature models the joint retirement behavior of couples
5

(Blau (1998), Blau and Gilletskie (2006), van der Klaauw and Wolpin (2008), and
Casanova (2012)). Although we do allow for endogenous labor supply and participation and people in our models start reducing work efforts as they age, we take the
maximum retirement age to be exogenous and leave the question of benefit claiming
for married and single people for future work.

The data

We use both PSID and HRS data for the cohort of men and women born between
1941 and 19452 . We pick one cohort to abstract from changes in behavior across
cohorts. We pick this particular cohort so that their entire adult life is first covered
by the PSID, which starts in 1968 (from which we use the rich information about wages
for men and women), and then by the HRS, which starts covering people at age 50
in 1994 (and has rich information on mortality by many observable characteristics).
Thus, this is a cohort for which we have excellent data over most of their working life
and retirement.

of earnings earned by women in a given age group or the whole working period.
Bottom panel: Fraction of married people, fraction of hours worked by married
people, and fraction of earnings earned by married people in a given age group

We now turn to key economic outcomes pertaining to our four groups. Table 2
shows that women and married people not only are numerous, but that that many
of them also work, and that they make up for a sizeable fraction of the aggregate
economy. The first line reports the fraction of workers who are women by age. For
the cohort that we consider, this number increases from 37% at age 25 to 44% at age
65. The next two lines report the fraction of hours worked by women as a fraction
of total hours and the fraction of total earnings that is earned by women. Both are
sizeable. The fraction of hours worked by women rises from 28% at age 25 to 40% at
age 65, while the fraction of earnings earned by women raises from 24% at age 25 to
27% at age 65. The bottom panel of the table shows that married people make up for
the majority of the population at each age group, going from 86% at age 25 to 78%
at age 65. The fraction of hours worked by married people follows the same pattern
from 86% at age 25 to 80% at age 65, while the fraction of earnings by married people
stays around 87% and declines only very slightly at age 65.
Thus, the aggregates (earnings, hours, and number of people working) are comprised of large fraction of women and married people, who are not typically included
in the calibration, and let alone modelled explicitly, in standard macro models. Besides noting that excluding these households in the calibration will very likely miss key
aggregates, it should be noted that the saving and labor supply of people in couples
might be very different from that of those of the single decision maker that is typically
modelled. In fact, single decision makers are a minority in the data and also earn a
7

relative small fraction of total earnings at all ages. The next section turns to comparing and describing aggregate and disaggregated patterns of important variables over
the life cycle to shed more light on behaviour and aggregation.

3.2

Life cycle patterns

We now turn to the life cycle patterns of participation, hours, labor income, and
wealth drawn from the data for the cohort that we focus on. We start by displaying
figures for the disaggregated profiles by gender and marital status, which we use in
Economy 4 and then turn to showing the profiles for the aggregates and all men only,
both married and single, (with the latter variable and set of profiles being the relevant
variable used in most macro models).3
3.2.1

Single and married men and women over the life cycle

To start understanding the role of gender and marital status in affecting life cycle
labor market outcomes and assets accumulation, we study life cycle profiles by gender
and marital status. Figure 1, panel (a), displays average labor participation for single
and married men and women.
Married men display on average the highest participation rate, over 98%, and
only slowly decrease their participation from age 40 to 50. The participation of single
men, instead, drops fast already starting at age 40. The participation of single women
displays a very similar shape to that of married men, but its level is shifted down by
about ten percentage points. Married women have the lowest participation. It starts
around 50% at age 25 to then increase to 78% at age 40, holds there until age 50 and
then gradually declines at a similar rate to that of the other three groups.
Average hours are shown in panel (b) of the same figure and follow broadly similar
patterns. Married men on average work more hours than everyone else. Women not
only have a participation rate lower than men on average but also display lower
3

To construct these graphs we take averages using the PSID data for individuals born between
1936-1950, that is we include two five-years cohorts adjacent to the cohort of interest (the one born
in 1941-45) in order to have enough observations in each age cell and at the same time minimize
the impact of cohort effects. To characterize the life cycle pattern of assets, we adopt a somewhat
different procedure because in the PSID assets are observed only in a few waves. For that, we select
individuals born between 1931 and 1955 to have enough observations and estimate a fourth-order
polynomial in age with ordinary least squares following individuals up to age 75 (age 70 in the case
of single men and single women). It is this estimated polynomial in age that is plotted in our graphs.

Turning to labor income and assets for single and married men and women, panel
(c), shows that married men have a much higher labor income than any other group,
because of their high average number of hours and higher hourly wage (which we
document in the calibration section). Women, both singles and married, have a much
lower average income at all ages, due to both their low average number of hours
and low hourly wage. While for single men average labor income drops after age
45, for women, both single and married, it increases until 50, due to their increasing
participation profile and hours. In panel (d) we report average assets for married
and single men and women. Average assets increase until age 65 for all groups,
with women accumulating the lowest amount and showing no sign of a slowdown in
accumulation before age 70.

3.2.2

The aggregates and men over the life cycle

The graphs in Figure 2 display two lines, the solid line corresponds to the aggregates in the economy, including men and women; while the circled line corresponds
to the aggregates for males only.
Graph (a) shows the lifecycle pattern of participation. The participation of men
stays around 98% until age 40 and then starts declining. The rate of decrease is faster
starting at age 50, with male participation dropping to 40% by age 65. Comparing
it with the red line, reveals that the gap in participation rate between the men only
and everyone of working age is over twenty percentage points at age 25 and only
gradually shrinks over the life cycle, because married women participate more later
on and then both men and women start reduce their participation as they age. This
graph shows that only considering male participation in the labor market drastically
overestimates overall aggregate participation.
Average hours (panel (b) in the same figure) follow a similar pattern, starting
at around 2,200 hours at age 25 for men, increasing to 2,300 hours by age 27, and
then declining slowly after age 40 and much faster after age 50, reflecting decreasing
participation. In contrast, average hours among people of working age, including men
and women, start out at a much lower level, around 1,500 a year at age 25 (thus 800
hours lower than for men) and only gradually increase, to peak around 1,700 hours
around age 45. Thus, the gap in average hours worked also shrinks over the life cycle
but remains large over most of it, and only looking at average hours worked by men
overestimates average hours worked.
Panel (c) highlights that average labor income for men increases gradually to
$50,000 by age 40 due to the increase of average hourly wage shown in Figure 3, stays
roughly constant until age 55, and then drops sharply after that age due to drops
in both average hourly wage and hours worked. The corresponding labor income for
the aggregate population including men and women is largely a shifted down version
of the one for men, at least until age 55, by about $12,000 a year. At age 25, this
corresponds to overestimating average labor earnings in the population by about one
third.
As panel (d) of the figure shows, average assets for men tend to increase until age
65, reaching $250,000, although after age 50 the growth rate gradually slows down.
Those for the overall population turn out to be very similar. This is unsurprising
given that most people are married and we split asset ownership between partners
10

equally to plot data for men and women separately.

The full model with marriage and singles

In this section, we describe the full model with couples and singles that we use in
Economy 4. Economies 1, 2, and 3 only include single people and are thus are special
cases of this model.
Our model period is one year. We explicitly model the working and retirement
stages of the life cycle. Let t be age ∈ {t0 , t1 , ..., tr , ..., td }, with tr being retirement
time and td being the maximum possible lifespan. People start their economic life at
the age of 20 and live up to the maximum age of 100. They retire at age 66 and from
that time on, they face mortality risk.
During their working stage, people are alive for sure, face shocks to their wages,
11

and are either single or married. Each household, whether single or married chooses
how much to save for next period and how much to work, with married people choosing
the labor supply of both partners. As in French (2005), we introduce a fixed time
cost of working for each person, which implies that, consistently with the observed
data, most people will not choose to work just a few hours. This fixed time cost of
working includes commuting time and time spent getting ready for work.
After retirement, the only control variable is savings and each person faces an
exogenous probability of death, which depends on their gender and marital status.
Thus, because of mortality risk after retirement, married people may lose their spouse
during that time. We use the superscript i to denote gender, with i = 1 being a man
and i = 2 being a woman. We use the superscript j to denote marital status, with
j = 1 for singles and j = 2 for couples. We allow the fixed cost of working to differ
by gender and marital status and, for married women, also by age, to incorporate the
costs of raising children in a parsimonious way. We allow the earnings processes to
depend on gender.

4.1

The government

The government taxes labor income using a proportional tax to finance old-age
Social Security. Social security benefits are taken from the 1997 average payments for
the groups that we study and thus depend on gender and marital status. We balance
the Social Security budget for the cohort that we consider.

4.2

Single men and women

Consider single people of working age. They have preferences given by
(cωt lt1−ω )1−γ − 1
v(ct , lt ) =
1−γ

(1)

where ct is consumption and lt is leisure, which is given by
lt = 1 − nt − φi,1
t Int ,

(2)

that is, total time endowment less nt , hours worked on the labor market, less the
fixed time cost of working. Int is an indicator function which equals 1 when hours
12

worked are positive and zero otherwise. The term φi,1
t represents the fixed time cost
of working for singles of gender i at age t.
Let eit be a deterministic age-efficiency profile, which is a function of the individuals’ age and gender. Let it be a persistent earnings shock that follows a Markov
process. The product of eit and it determines an agent’s units of effective labor per
hour worked during the period.
ln it+1 = ρi ln it + υti , υti ∼ N (0, συ2 ).

(3)

Let at be assets which earn interest rate r. The state variables for a single individual are age t, gender i, asset ait , and the persistent earnings shock it . From the
first period of working age and until retirement, the recursive problem of the single
person of gender i can thus be written as

Calibration

In all of our four model economies, we assume that the U.S. is an open economy
and we set the interest rate r to 4% and the risk aversion parameter, γ, to 2. The
Social Security tax, τss , on workers is set to be 3.8%, which was the worker’s tax rate
for Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program in 1968. We choose this
year because we focus on birth cohorts of 1941-1945, who were age 23-27 in 1968, and
thus recently started working in that year.

Figure 3: Potential wages over the life cycle for men and women born in the 1941-1945
cohort (PSID data), for men and women together regardless of gender, and at
the household level (average between partners) for people in couples

Turning to potential wages, Figure 3 displays four lines: mean potential wage
by gender (solid line for men and starred line for women) and mean potential wage
obtained ignoring gender and marital status differences and thus pooling all men and
women together (dotted line) and average potential wage at the household level for
couples, expressed in per-capita terms (dashed line). We compute these from the
PSID, should everyone in our sample choose to work. These lines display several
15

interesting facts. First, for this cohort, the wages of women are significantly lower
than those for men for their whole working lives. For instance, at age 25, men start
their working life with an average potential wage of over $14 an hour (which we express
in 1998 dollars) while women’s potential hourly wage is just above $10. Thus, the
gap between men and women at age 25 is four dollar an hour, that is 40% of women’s
wages. Second, men’s wages grow faster than women’s until age 35, while women’s
wages grow faster after age 35-40. The result is that even at age 55-60, when women’s
potential wages are peaking, the potential wage gap across genders is over $7, which
is more than one-half of what an average woman would make per hour, should she
choose to work. The profile generated ignoring gender differences is, unsurprisingly,
almost in the middle of those for men and women and its shape is similar to both of
the other profiles. The profile for the average potential wage of someone in a couple is
a bit higher than the profile that ignores marital status, partly because single people
have lower wages.
Turning for the stochastic processes for wages, Table 4 reports estimates for the
stochastic component of earnings, that we assume to be an AR(1) (as specified in
equation 3) and we estimate from PSID data. It shows that women experience slightly
smaller persistence in wages than men, 0.96 compared to 0.97, but similar variances.
The third column reports data for the case in which we pool all data for men and
women together and ignore gender differences (used in Economy 2), while the last
column treats the household as a unit and computes average potential wages between
members of the couple. The table shows that ignoring gender differences and putting

men and women together when estimating the stochastic component for wages generates a persistence very similar to that of men, but a variance of the productivity shock
that is twice as large that for males and an initial variance that is 1.3 times larger than
that of men. In contrast, for the average member in couple, while the persistence is
also very similar to that of men’s wages, both the variance of the productivity shock
16

and especially the initial variance are much lower than the corresponding statistics
in the other samples.
Turning to the calibration of our mortality probabilities, Table 5 compares their
implied life expectancies at age 70, 80 and 90 from the 2013 U.S. life table (source:
Social Security Administration (SSA)) and our calculations from the HRS. The numbers refer to different populations, as the U.S. life table is a cross-sectional life table
for the year 2013, while our calculations use the period 1998-2013, control for cohort
effects, and refer to the 1941-45 cohort.
Despite these differences, our HRS sample generates very similar life expectancies
for women and underestimates the life expectancy for men by only nine months at
age 70. At more advanced ages, our estimates become even more precise. According
to our HRS sample, there is a large gap in life expectancy at age 70 between singles
and married individuals: married men expect to live 2.5 years longer than single men
and married women expect to live 2.1 years longer than single women. These gaps
shrink at older ages. The appendix reports details on how we use the PSID and the

Results

We now turn to discussing the results for our four model economies and their
aggregate implications.

6.1

Economy 1, a no marriage economy calibrated to men

For the calibration of Economy 1, a no marriage economy calibrated to men, we
use the survival probabilities and the wage process for men that we just described in
the calibration section. The top panel of Table 6 reports the parameters that we use
to match our targets, that we list in the bottom part of the same table. The Social
Security benefit is chosen to match the government budget constraint for this cohort.
All of the parameters are consistent with those used in the literature. In particular,
the value of labor participation cost is very close to that in French (2005).

6.1.1

The model’s fit to the data for men

Figure 4 displays labor supply participation, average hours, labor income, and
savings over the life cycle in the actual data and the singles economy. The model
matches well the main features of the data for men but tends to over predict participation and hours after age 55, where it might be missing the role of health shocks
and endogenous benefit and pension claiming. Overall, however, the model matches
the most important features of the data for men over the life cycle well.
6.1.2

The model’s implications compared to the aggregate data

To evaluate the extent to which a model calibrated to only men misrepresents
key economic aggregates, we now turn to comparing the outcomes of this calibrated

in the data.
Figure 5 compares the aggregate life cycle profile by age for the observed data and
Economy 1. It shows that only modeling men misses important aspects of aggregate
behavior over the life cycle. First, the economy with only men drastically overestimates participation by about 10 percentage points over the life cycle of this cohort.
Second, it overestimates average hours over the life cycle by about 500 hours, which
is almost one-third of actual aggregate hours in this cohort. Third, it overestimates
average earnings by age. For instance, at age 45, average earnings are close to $35,000
a year, while the singles economy predicts over $45,000, thus almost overpredicting
earnings by one third. Finally, the model underpredicts average assets at retirement
and predicts much faster asset decumulation after retirement than in the data, partly
because the life expectancy of men is lower than that of women.

Economy 2, a no marriage economy calibrated to men
and women together

The goal of economy 2 is to see whether we can use data for men and women
together to match aggregate outcomes without having to write, solve, and calibrate,
more complicated models with gender and marriage. Thus, we put all men and
women in the same sample, both married and single, and we estimate the survival
probabilities and the wage process for this mix of people, treating them as individuals,
and ignoring any gender and marital status differences.
The top panel of Table 7 reports the parameters that we use to match our targets,
that we list in the bottom part of the same table. The calibrated discount factor is
very similar to that in the singles economy because average assets at age 50 are very
similar in these two economies. The weight on consumption is lower in Economy 2
20

than in Economy 1 because average working hours at age 50 is lower in Economy 2,
as women tend to work less than men on average. The Social Security benefit chosen
to match the government budget constraint for this cohort is lower in Economy 2
because total labor income that pays Social Security tax is also lower due to the
inclusion of women in the sample. The participation cost is higher than in Economy
1 to match lower labor participation rate.

6.2.1

The model’s fit to the data for men and women pooled together,
and thus the aggregates

Figure 6 displays labor supply participation, average hours, labor income, and
savings over the life cycle in the actual data and in Economy 2. The model has a
harder time of fitting the profiles of participation and hours than Economy 1 does
because it does not explicitly take into account the differences between men and
women. In particular, the model over predicts participation and hours for for both
younger and older individuals and only does well on both dimensions during the prime
age period (age 40 to 55) and largely overpredicts labor earnings.
Unlike in Economy 1, where we target data for males, for this economy, the targets
that we are trying to match also coincide with the true aggregates in the economy
and thus also speak to the success and failures of the model in that regards. Thus,
calibrating the model to wages and life expectancy of men and women together,
ignoring gender and marital status differences, yields a better match than just using
data for men, as done in Economy 1. The biggest success of this calibration compared

to Economy 1 is the match in labor earnings over the life cycle, which is very close.
Unfortunately, however, it still implies patterns of participation and hours over the
life cycle that miss over most of the life cycle, with the exception of the period between
ages 45 and 55. In addition, and as in Economy 1, Economy 2 under predicts assets
at retirement and generates faster asset decumulation after retirement than in the
data.
In Economy 4, we allow the fixed cost of working for married women to be changing
by age to take into account child rearing costs in a simple way. Thus, one might
think that the two models are not on an even ground because Economy 4 has more
parameters that allow for a better fit of the data. Thus, in Appendix D we report
results for Economy 2 in the case of age-varying fixed costs of working and show that
it fits the data very similarly to without a age-varying fixed cost of working (we call
it Economy 2b).
22

6.3

Economy 3, a no marriage, household-level calibration
for couples only

Economy 3 is a “No marriage, household-level calibration for couples only” economy that uses the same model as Economies 1 and 2, but in the calibration we
aggregate the data at the household level and we only keep couples. More specifically, for members of couples we compute life expectancy regardless of gender and
we compute the average potential wage of the two members of the household. This
is in contrast with Economies 1 and 2, in which we were only looking at individuallevel data, ignoring that some people are in couples and some others are not. In
Appendix D we show the results for a household-level calibration that also includes
singles (we call it Economy 3b), the results are very similar to those in Economy 3
that we report here.
The top panel of Table 8 reports the parameters that we use to match our targets,
that we list in the bottom part of the same table. The calibrated discount factor is
higher than in Economy 1 because average assets at age 50 for households are similar,
but the wages are lower. The weight on consumption is lower than in Economy 1
because average working hours at the individual level in a household at age 50 are
lower in Economy 3, because women tend to work less than men on average. The
Social Security benefit chosen to match the government budget constraint for this
cohort is lower than in Economy 1 because average labor income that pays Social
Security tax is also lower at the household level than for males. The participation
cost is lower than in Economy 1 to match a much higher labor participation rate at
the household level (we count a household participating in the data if at least one of
the people in the household participate in the labor market).
6.3.1

The model’s fit to the data for married people, at the household
level

Figure 7 displays labor supply participation, average hours, labor income, and
savings over the life cycle in the actual data for married people, at the household
level, and in Economy 3. It is important that this is a household-level calibration.
Thus, in the data, we count a married household as participating in the labor market
if at least on one of the two people in the household is working. As a result, the
empirical profile for participation is very high and only starts declining at age 50. The

for this cohort

model has a hard time matching the participation profile for households in couples
over the life cycle and underestimates participation at all ages, except between age 30
and 35. In addition, the gap between the model-predicted participation and actual
participation in the data keeps increasing with age starting at age 35. For the data,
we compute hours worked as the average, per-person, in the couple. Comparing the
model-generated data with the actual data for married households, the model cannot
match hours over the life cycle, except for ages 45-50. One bright spot is that this
model matches average labor income over the life cycle much better than Economy 1
and as well as Economy 2. As the previously studied model economies, this one also
understates retirement savings.
6.3.2

The models’ implications compared to the aggregates in the data

Figure 8 compares the aggregates generated over the life cycle by our economy with
married people only to those in the aggregate economy, including everyone at every
age. This model economy does much better than Economy 1 and as well as Economy
2 in terms of matching the aggregate data, and actually matches participation, hours
worked, labor income, and assets reasonably well over the whole life cycle. In terms of
discrepancies, Economy 3 tends to overpredict labor participation and hours outside
of the 40 and 50 age group.

The marriage and singles, men and women economy

For the marriage economy, we use the model that explicitly models households
with two decision makers and in the calibration stage we use the survival probabilities
for single men, single women, and married men and women, and the wage processes
for men and women that we have estimated and described in Section 3. Appendix D
reports the results for an Economy with only married couples (Economy 4b), which
are very similar to those that we report here.

economy to match the corresponding target moments that are listed in the bottom

other groups by fixing the ratios of benefits by group relative to single men to match
the data reported in 1997. According to SSA, in 1997, median income for elderly
unmarried women was 98.8% of that for unmarried men, and median income for
elderly married couples was 183.0% that for unmarried men.5
We use participation costs to match the labor participation rate and hours worked
at age 50 for a given group. For single men, married men, and single women, we
assume that these costs are constant over the life cycle. For married women, to

We calculated the ratios using the 1997 SSA report, that reads “In 1997, median income for
elderly unmarried women (widowed, divorced, separated, and never married) was $11,161, compared
with $14,769 for elderly unmarried men and $29,278 for elderly married couples. Elderly unmarried
women – including widows – get 51 percent of their total income from Social Security. Unmarried
elderly men get 39 percent, while elderly married couples get 36 percent of their income from Social
Security.” Thus, we set SS benefits to $5,692 for single women, to $5,760 for single men, and to
$10,540 for couples (https://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/women.html).

Table 9: Economy 4, a married and singles economy. Top panel: Parameters. Bottom
panel: Target moments for the marriage economy. The data moments come from
our computations on PSID and HRS data. The SS budget deficit is expressed as
the ratio to the SS budget for this cohort

capture the role of child reading in a simple way, we assume that married women face
a time-varying participation cost over their life cycle. The corresponding coefficients
for φti=2,j=2 are 0.0009, −0.0233, −1.0297. The additional targets for married women
are average hours and participation at ages 35, 45, and 55.
Figure 14 in Appendix C reports the age-varying costs of working for each group in
this economy. As it turns out, the participation cost for married women is relatively
high during the peak childbearing years, but then decreases to reconcile their labor
income patterns, due to their lower wage and higher family assets. The participation
cost for single women turns out to be higher than that of both married women and
men to match their low participation rate. In reality, they might be stuck in lowpaying jobs expecting to get married. Thus, the participation cost is a stand in for
more than just commuting costs.

6.4.1

The model’s fit to the data for married and single men and women

The top panel of Figure 9 displays the life cycle profiles of labor participation rate
by gender in the data (left panel) and the model (right panel). Here, too, the model
captures the main aspects of the data. Single women are more likely to participate
in the labor market than married women, despite the fact that single women face a
larger participation cost. Married women have a lower labor participation rate than
single women because of division of labor among couples in presence of a fixed cost
of working and lower wages for women than men. Single men participate less than
married men in the labor market when older.

The bottom panel of Figure 9 displays average hours worked. As in the data, the
model delivers a large difference in hours worked by gender among singles: Single
women work less on average than single men because single women faces a larger
participation cost. As in the data, married men work much more than married
women because married couples care about the total household income and maximize
household utility and because women on average earn lower wage than men, they
enjoy more leisure.

Figure 10: Economy 4, a married and singles economy. Data (Left panel) and model
(Right panel). Model fit

The bottom panel of Figure 10 displays life cycle profiles of average household
assets by gender and marital status. Before age 70, assets among single women
are lower than assets among single men because single women have lower earnings
29

capacity. However, women hold more assets than men late in life because women live
longer and thus need to shift more resources to the future to smooth consumption.
Average asset among married couple are much higher than that for singles but still fall
short of what is observed in the data. This is because the model struggles to match
savings for our three age groups, in particular, it overestimates saving by single men
while underestimating savings for couples. This could possible reflect some preference
heterogeneity across groups that we are abstracting from.
6.4.2

The models’ implications compared to the aggregates in the data

Figure 11 compares the aggregates generated over the life cycle by our economy
with married people and single people to those in the aggregate economy, including
everyone at every age. This model economy does much better than Economies 1, 2
and 3 in terms of matching the aggregate data, and actually matches participation,
hours worked, labor income, and assets well over the whole life cycle. In terms of
discrepancies, Economy 4 also tends to underpredict labor participation between ages
40 and 50 (by less than 10 percentage points) and tends to overpredict hours and labor
income a bit over all of the life cycle. However, compared with the economies without
two-agent couples, these misses between model and data are minor.

Figure 11: Economy 4, a married and singles economy. Data (Left panel) and model

fraction of people aged 25-65 participating in the labor market. A comparison of our
data and model economies shows that average participation over the life cycle is 78%
for our cohort and 94%, 86%, and 76% respectively in Economies 1-4. The second
row in the table shows that average yearly working hours are 1,562 in our data, and
2,050, 1,725, 1,756, and 1,656 respectively in Economies 1-4. Lastly, the third line
shows that average earnings over the working period are $29,628 in our data, and
42,566, 30,392, 30,702, and 31,652 respectively in Economies 1-4.
The bottom panel of the table summarizes the success and misses of the model
economies. Economy 1 overpredicts average labor participation over the life cycle by
16 percentage points, overpredicts hours by 31%, and overpredicts earnings by 44%.
Economies 2 and 3 respectively over predict participation by 12 and 10 percentage
points and underpredict earnings by only 2.6 and 3.6%, thus coming somewhat closer
to the data than Economy 1. Finally, Economy 4 does better than all of the economies
31

that we consider by underpredicting participation by only 2% and overpredicting
hours by 6% and earnings by 7%.
We thus conclude that even macroeconomists not interested in heterogeneity in
marriage and gender per se should start taking marriage and gender differences more
seriously in the context of quantitative structural models. In particular, modelling
gender and marriage explicitly would yield the best results in terms of matching
the aggregates, but if this is not possible given the question and complications at
hand, calibrating (or estimating) the model including both men and women in the
data or keeping track of households to determine household-level wages and hours (or
earnings), participation, and assets will help the model better match the aggregates.

Appendix A: The data
In this appendix we describe the data sets and techniques used to compute the
inputs for the models and the data outputs that the model is calibrated to match.

The PSID
The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) is a longitudinal study of a representative sample of the U.S. population. In the first year of the survey, 1968, about
5,000 families were first interviewed, with information gathered on these families and
all of their descendants from that time onwards. Individuals are followed over time
to maintain a representative sample of families. To accomplish this, the PSID sample
persons include all persons living in the PSID families in 1968 plus anyone subsequently born to or adopted by a sample person. All sample members are followed
even when leaving to establish separate family units. PSID families also include many
non-sample persons, typically individuals who married sample persons after the beginning of the study in 1968. Information on non-sample persons such as spouses is
collected while they are living in the same household as an individual in the original
sample. However, once they stop living with a sample person, they are not followed
further.
The original 1968 PSID sample was drawn from an over-sample of 1,872 low
income families from the Survey of Economic Opportunity (the SEO sample) and
from a nationally representative sample of 2,930 families designed by the Survey
Research Center at the University of Michigan (the SRC sample).

We are interested in the cohort born in 1941-1945. To gather relevant information
for this cohort, we select individuals born before or after the period 1941-1945, we
control for cohort effects, and use results relative to the cohort of interest. More
specifically, we select all individuals in the SRC sample who are interviewed at least
twice in the sample years 1968-2013, select only heads and their wives, if present, and
keep individuals born between 1931 and 1955. Thus, as we consider five-year-of-birth
cohorts, we are including two younger cohorts (1931-35 and 1936-40) and two older
cohorts (1946-50 and 1951-55) than our cohort of interest. The resulting sample,
used to estimate potential wage, includes 5,129 individuals aged 20 to 70, for a total
of 103,420 observations. When estimating the life cycle wage rate profiles, however,
to minimize the impact of cohort effects, we restrict the sample to 2,795 individuals
born between 1936 and 1951, for a total of 59,885 observations, as we detail below.
The wage rate is defined as annual earnings divided by annual hours worked.
Gross annual earnings are defined as previous year’s income from labor, while annual
hours are previous year’s annual hours spent working for pay.
Assets are only observed in 1984, 1989, 1994, 1999 and then every two years until
2013. We use total assets defined as the sum of all assets types available in the PSID,
net of debt and plus the value of home equity. All monetary values are expressed in
1998 prices.
Wage profiles
We need an estimate of the potential wage profiles and wage processes by age and
gender for all individuals, including those non participating in the labor market. To
this goal, we first use an imputation procedure to estimate potential wage for non
participants. We then estimate the average wage profile by age and the persistence
and variance of its unobserved component. In this second set of estimates, we alternatively pool men and women together or consider them separately, depending on
the economy we are calibrating.
Imputation. In the data, wages may be missing for two reasons: 1) An individual
may have been active in the labor market but earnings or hours information (or both)
are missing; 2) An individual has not been active in the labor market.
Because estimated variances are very sensitive to outliers, we set to missing observations with an hourly wage rate below half the minimum wage and above $250
(in 1998 values). We then impute all the missing values with the same procedure.
37

In our sample, out of a total of 103,420 observations, we observe the wage rate for
79,956 observations and we impute it for the remaining 23,464. Of those missing, 23%
refer to individuals who were active in the labor market but have earnings and/or
hours information missing. The remaining 77% of the missing refer to individuals
who were not active in the labor market in a particular year.
Figure 12 reports the fraction of people in a given age and demographic group
for whom the actual wage is observed. This figure displays a pattern very similar
to the participation profile. Thus, married women, being the group with the lowest
participation rate, is also the group for which the wage imputation procedure has to
be applied the most.

Figure 12: Fraction of individuals for whom actual wage is observed

We impute wage values using coefficients from OLS regressions run separately for
men and women and for single and married individuals (four separate groups). To
avoid endpoint problems with the polynomials in age, we include individuals aged 20
to 70 in the sample. The dependent variable in our regressions is the logarithm of the
hourly wage rate. As explanatory variables we include: a fourth-order polynomial
in age, cohort dummies, time dummies (adding up to zero and orthogonal to a time
trend), family size (dummies for each value), education (dummies for three levels,
less than high school, high school and college), number of children (dummies for each
value), age of youngest child, and an indicator of partner working if married. As an
indicator of health we use a variable recording whether bad health limits the capacity
of working, as this is the only health indicator available for all years (self-reported
health starts in 1984 and is not asked before). This health indicator however is not
38

collected for wives, so we do not include it in the regression for married women. All
regressions also include interactions terms between the explanatory variables. Using
the estimated coefficients, the predicted value of the (logarithm of the) wage is taken
as a measure of the potential wage for observations with a missing wage. When the
wage is observed, we use the actual wage.
Alternatively, we could estimate fixed effect regressions separately for men and
women and include marital status as an explanatory variable because it is not constant
over time. From these estimates, we would obtain an estimate of the fixed effect for
each individual, and use it along with the estimated coefficients it to impute missing
values. With this procedure, however, we would obtain an estimate of the fixed effect
only for individuals with at least two non-missing wages, while with OLS we can
estimate the potential wage for all individuals in our sample.
Estimation. We use the potential wage to estimate the deterministic age-efficiency
profile eit as a function of age. The sample is restricted to individuals born between
1936 and 1951, to account for changes in the age-efficiency profile. After this selection, there are 2,795 individuals born between 1936 and 1951, for a total of 59,885
observations. To estimate the wage profile, we run a fixed effect regression of the
logarithm of the wage rate on a fourth-order age polynomial, separately for men and
women or pooling them together, depending on the economy we are calibrating. We
then regress the residuals on time and cohort dummies to compute the average effect
for the cohort born in 1941-1945 and use that estimate to fix the constant of the wage
profile. The estimated potential wage profile for all cases is shown in the main text
in Figure 3.
To show the effect of our imputation procedure in Figure 13 we plot, for men
and women separately, both the estimated potential wage profile, which includes
our imputation for missing values, and the estimated observed wage profile, which
includes only observations for which the wage rate is actually observed. As shown
in the picture, indeed the potential wage is lower than the observed one for men,
while for women the difference is evident only after age 55. This is consistent with
people with lower productivity choosing not to participate in the labor market and
thus potential wage being lower than the actual observed wage.
To estimate the variance structure of the log wage rate we use residuals of the log
wage rate computed with the same procedure just described, that is we first run a

In this case, to have enough observations to estimate the variances, we include all
cohorts from 1931 to 1955. When computing the variances, we limit the age range
between 25 and 55 and we use waves only up to 1997, the last wave in which yearly
data are available. As we rely on residuals also taken from imputed wages, we drop
the highest 0.5% residuals both for men and women, in order to avoid large outliers
to inflate the estimated variances (however, the effect of this drop is negligible on our
estimates).
The shock in log wage is modelled as the sum of a persistent component plus a
white noise, which captures measurement error
i
ln uit+1 = ln it+1 + ξt+1
i
ln it+1 = ρi ln it + vt+1
i
i
Where i indicates men and women and ξt+1
and vt+1
are white noise processes with
2
2
zero mean and variances equal to σiξ
and σiv
respectively. This last variance, together
i
with the persistent parameter ρ , characterize the AR process in the model. Estimation is carried out using minimum distance techniques, standard in the literature
6

In the second step we add time dummies (as in Deaton and Paxson, 1994), constrained to add up
to zero and orthogonal to a time trend. Adding this sort of time dummies is not strictly necessary,
as those business cycle shocks would be captured by the white noise component in the estimation of
the variance of the unobserved component of wage.

together, and married households) are shown in the main text in Table 4.
Initial assets and wage shocks
We parameterize the joint distribution of initial assets and wage shocks at age 25
as a joint log normal in the logarithm of assets and the wage shock. We set a shift
parameter δa for assets to have only positive values and to be able to take logs. The
wage shock is the residual from the wage regressions described above, re-scaled in
order to remove the white noise component.

Where Σc is a 3x3 covariance matrix computed on the data for married or cohabitating couples.

The HRS
We use the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to compute inputs for the retirement period because this data set contains a large number of observations and
high quality data for this stage of the life cycle. In fact, the HRS is a longitudinal
data set collecting information on people aged 50 or older, including a wide range
of demographic, economic, and social characteristics, as well as physical and mental
health, and cognitive functioning.
The HRS started collecting information in 1992 on individuals born between 1931
and 1941, the so-called initial HRS cohort, which was then re-interviewed every two
41

years. Other cohorts were introduced over the years, the AHEAD (Assets and Health
Dynamics Among the Oldest Old) cohort, born before 1924, was first interviewed in
1993, while the Children of Depression (CODA) cohort, born 1924 to 1930, and the
War Baby cohort, which includes individuals born 1942 to 1947, were introduced in
1998 and subsequently interviewed every two years. Younger cohorts, the Early Baby
Boomer (EBB), born 1948 to 1953, and the Mid Baby Boomer (MBB), born 1954 to
1959, were first interviewed in 2004 and 2010 respectively.
To estimate input probabilities and outputs to be matched, we need information
for individuals born during the 1941-1945 period. To this end, we include all individuals of all cohorts starting from wave 3 (year 1996). We estimate the relevant
probabilities using all individuals born between 1900 and 1945, controlling for cohort
effects and using coefficients relative to the cohort born in 1941-1945.
Our dataset is based on the RAND HRS files and the EXIT files to include information on the wave right after death. Our sample selection is as follows. Of the
37,317 individuals initially present, we drop individuals for which marital status is
not observed (2,275 individuals) because marital status is a crucial information in
our analysis. This sample consists of 35,042 individuals and 176,698 observations.
We then select individuals in the age range 66-100 born in 1900 to 1945, obtaining a
sample of 15,072 individuals and 67,744 observations.
Survival probabilities
We model the probability of being alive at time t as a logit function:
πst = P rob(St =

1/Xts )

exp(Xts )
.
=
1 + exp(Xts )

We include as explanatory variables a fourth-order polynomial in age, gender, and
interactions between these variables. When we calibrate economies that ignore gender
differences, we do not control for gender. For Economy 4, when we consider marriage,
we also include marital status and interactions of the previous variables with marital
status. We also include cohort dummies and use coefficients relative to the 1941-1945
cohort in the model. As the HRS is collected every two years, we transform the
biennial probability of surviving into an annual probability by taking the square root
of the biennial probability. Having estimated survival probabilities in the age range
66-100, we apply standard formulae to compute life expectancy at various ages.
42

Appendix B: Sketch of the Solution Algorithm
The state space for average lifetime earnings and asset holdings is discretized into
unevenly spaced grids. We use regular grid search to solve the model.
In our full model, we need to compute two sets of value functions by age. The
value function of being single and the value function of the two people in the married
couple.
The value function of the couples depends on their own future continuation value
and the one of the singles, in case of death of a spouse. This is thus how the solution
is computed during retirement:
1. Compute the value function of the retired single person for all time periods after
retirement, doing the usual backward iteration starting from the last period.
2. Compute the value function of the retired couple for all time periods after
retirement, which uses the previous one in case of death of one of the spouses,
doing the usual backward iteration starting from the last period.
For each period, working backwards over the life cycle, we apply the following
solution strategy:
1. For any given time period, compute the value function of being single.
2. Given the value function of being single, compute the value function of the
couple.
After we solve the value functions and policy functions, we simulate as follows.
We take initial distributions of people by marital status and wages from the PSID
data. We then use the model to simulate our cohort until the end of its life cycle.

Economy 2b, a no marriage economy calibrated to men
and women together with an age-varying fixed cost of
working

In Economy 4, we allow the fixed cost of working for married women to be changing
by age to take into account child rearing costs in a simple way. Thus, one might
think that the two models are not on an even ground because Economy 4 has more
parameters that allow for a better fit of the data. Thus, in the following pictures,
we also allow for an age-varying fixed cost of working in Economy 2. We use the
following function, which is parameterized by three parameters, which are chosen at
the calibration stage to match participation as closely as possible at ages 35, 45, and
exp(at2 −bt−c)
55, as we do in Economy 4. φti=2,j=2 = 1+exp(at
2 −bt−c) . As we can see in this Appendix,
even when we allow for more parameters for Economy 2 to match the data, the fit of
labor participation only marginally improve between the ages of 45 and 55 and the
economy still has similar misses as Economy 1 without the age-varying participation
cost. Table 12 reports the calibration table for Economy 2 in the case of age-varying
fixed costs of working.

Economy 3b is a “No marriage, household-level calibration” economy that uses

data at the household level, for both singles and couples. Compared to Economy 3,
it also contains single households.

The model’s fit to the data for married people, at the household
level

Figure 16 displays labor supply participation, average hours, labor income, and
savings over the life cycle in the actual data for married people, at the household
level, and in Economy 3b. Consistently with the observation that there are very few
people, the results for this model economy is very similar to that in Economy 3.

Figure 20 compares the aggregates generated over the life cycle by our economy
with married people only to those in the aggregate economy, including everyone at

Economy 3.

Economy 4b, Marriage only, men and women

Economy 4b is a slightly simpler case of Economy 4 that ignores the working
singles. It is a “Marriage only, men and women” economy in which everyone is
married, and married men and women are calibrated using the corresponding observed
data for their own group. Hence, there are no single people in this economy during

SS budget for this cohort

the working period (retired people might become single because of spousal death),
but gender and marriage are modeled explicitly. Since, the model largely abstracts
from singles, it misses them from the data, but it is bit simpler than the next model
that we consider. As we will see, since there are few single people, the results and
conclusions are very similar to those of Economy 4.
For this economy, we use the survival probabilities for married men and women,
and the wage processes for men and women that we have estimated and described
in Section 3. The difference with Economy 4, is that there are no single people of
working age in in this economy. Since people in a couple can die after age 65, we
have some people turning single after that time, due to spousal death. We ignore all
single people for calibration purposes because this economy focuses on understanding
married couples.
The top panel of Table 14 reports the parameters that we choose for the Economy 3
to match the corresponding target moments that are listed in the bottom panel of the
same Table. The Social Security benefit for couples is chosen to match the government
budget constraint for this cohort, which is very close to the number reported by SSA.
According to SSA, in 1997, median income for elderly married couples was $10, 540.7
7

We calculated the ratios using the 1997 SSA report, that reads “In 1997, median income for
elderly unmarried women (widowed, divorced, separated, and never married) was $11,161, compared
with $14,769 for elderly unmarried men and $29,278 for elderly married couples. Elderly unmarried
women – including widows – get 51 percent of their total income from Social Security. Unmarried
elderly men get 39 percent, while elderly married couples get 36 percent of their income from Social
Security.” Thus, we set SS benefits to $5,692 for single women, to $5,760 for single men, and to
$10,540 for couples (https://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/women.html).

Figure 16: Economy 3b, a no marriage economy calibrated to married and single people
at the household level. Model fit to household-level data

We use participation costs to match the labor participation rate and hours worked
at age 50 for married men and women. For married men, we assume that these costs
are constant over the life cycle. For married women, to capture the role of child
reading in a simple way, we assume that married women face a time-varying participation cost over their life cycle, which is a quadratic function of age φi=2,j=2
=
t
exp(0.0009t2 −0.0236t−1.0708)
. The additional targets for married women are average
1+exp(0.0009t2 −0.0236t−1.0708)
hours and participation at ages 35, 45, and 55. Figure 14 in Appendix C displays the
life cycle labor participation costs that we use for each group. As it turns out, the
participation cost for married women is relatively high during the peak childbearing
years, but then decreases to reconcile their labor income patterns, due to their lower
wage and higher family assets.

The model’s fit to the data for married men and women, excluding
singles

The top panel of Figure 18 displays the life cycle profiles of labor participation
rate by gender in the data (left panel) and the model (right panel). As in the data,
the model delivers a large difference in hours worked by gender. As in the data,
married men participate much more than married women because women on average
earn lower wage than men.
The second panel of Figure 18 displays average hours worked. As in the data, the
model delivers a large difference in hours worked by gender. As in the data, married
men work more than married women because married couples care about the total
household income and maximize household utility and women on average earn lower
wage than men. As a result, in our model they enjoy more leisure. The third panel

The models’ implications compared to the aggregates in the data

Figure 20 compares the aggregates generated over the life cycle by our economy
with married people only to those in the aggregate economy, including everyone at
every age. This model economy does much better than Economies 1, 2, and 3 in terms
of matching the aggregate data, and actually matches participation, hours worked,
labor income, and assets well over the whole life cycle. In terms of discrepancies,
Economy 4b tends to underpredict labor participation between ages 40 and 50 (by
less than 10 percentage points) and tends to overpredict labor income a bit over all
of the life cycle. However, compared with the economies without two-agent couples,
these misses between model and data are minor.
Thus, as Economy 4, Economy 4b (Marriage, married men and women only) does
much better than Economies 1 and 2 in terms of matching the aggregate data, and
