Fiscal Policies and the Dollar/Pound Exchange Rate: 1870-1984

ABSTRACT

This Paper investigates the conseouences of fiscal policies for the

exchange rate. After deveiopin a simple theory of how government
financing policies should effect the exchange rate, we test it using data

on the dollar/pound exchanoe rate. Previous analyses have concentrated
mainly on the post—Bretton Woods flexible exchange rate system, thus
ignoring potentially useful information contained in fixed exchange rate

periods or in previous flexible exchange rate periods. This paper shows
that it is theoretically proper and econometrically feasible to merge

evidence from different nominal exchange rate systems. The gain ot this

procedure is that we can extend the sample period back to the i870s. Our
results suggest that permanent government expenditures are the only fiscal
variables that significantly affected the dollaripound nominal exchange

rate. Budget deficits appear to be irrelevant in this respect.

1. Introduction

That there exists a strong relationship between government policies and
the nominal exchange rate has long been recognized.

Monetary policies, in

particular, have been the object of several theoretical and empirical attempts
to explain exchange rate movements during periods of flexible exchange rate

regimes. More recently, considerable effort has been devoted to the
understanding of exchange rate discontinuities caused by the collapse of fixed

exchange rate regimes. Most of this theoretical and empirical work has
focused on the monetary causes of these exchange rate movements.

They all

stress the fundamental incompatibility of continuous inflationary policies
with the maintenance of a fixed exchange rate.

Even if monetary policies have been a prime subject of investigation,
little attention has been paid, either by the flexible exchange rate

literature or by the collapsing exchange rate literature, to theunderlying

determinants of monetary policies. This paper, on the other hand, explicitly
considers the rationale behind money supply decisions, by formalizing the link

between fiscal and monetary policy. Inflation, in particular, is seen as the
result of the optimal financing of an exogenous stream of government
expenditures.

By stressing the role of inflation as a financing instrument, this
analysis provides useful insights into the understanding of the evolution of

the international monetary system. At the basis of this approach is the idea
that both the dynamics of flexible exchange rates and the choice of exchange

rate regime are endogenous variables. In this paper we take the view that
government spending is the fundamental exogenous variable driving both the
exchange rate (during flexible regime periods) and the switches between the

3

two

alternative

exchange rate regimes. A brief overview of the history of the

dollar/pound exchange rate reveals, in fact, an alternation of periods of
fixed exchange rates (during times of relative tranquillity in government
spending), and periods of flexible rates (during periods of high and divergent
level of expenditure).

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a simple model in
which inflation, income taxes and deficits are the results of an optimal

government budget decision. Section 3 derives the implications for exchange
rate behavior1 and estimate the model using ordinary least squares.

Section 4

describes a variant of censored data techniques that can be fruitfully used in
this circumstance, and provides maximum likelihood estimates following this

approach. Section 5 concludes the paper with a summary of the results.

2. A Model of Optimal Seizniorage

In this section we describe a simple model in which the dynamics of
income taxes, seigniorage and government debt are the result of a rational
decision of the government seeking to finance a given flow of expenditure in

an optimal manner. The model is close in spirit to work on optimal inflation
tax by Phelps (1973). A similar approach is used by Mankiw (1987) to explain
the post World War II behavior of nominal interest rates in the U.S.

The intuition behind the model is quite simple. The government can use
different means of financing its expenditure: income taxes, monetization or
deficits. The government has to choose the optimal mix of these instruments.
If the problem has an interior solution, part of expenditure is going to be
financed by money creation.

Consider an economy whose representative agent is interested in

4

maximizing his expected lifetime utility, U, which is given by

U —

E0(

E
t—O

where c is the consumption at time t, and 0 < < 1 is the discount factor.
Randomness in this economy is the consequence of stochastic government

spending and output, which will be introduced below. The agents of this
economy have access to the international credit market, where real bonds
are traded at the world given interest rate r that, for simplicity, is

The individuals are assumed to hold cash

balances in order to economize on the transaction cost of exchange.

Transactions are costly in the sense that a certain fraction of individual's

real income is used up in the transaction process. This fraction, v, is a
convex function of the ratio of real balances held by the agent to his real
income, i.e.

v'<O

—

< 1

where P is the price level and y the exogenous real income.' In addition,
agents are required to pay taxes

in real terms. In order to capture in a

simple way the distortionary effects of income taxes, we assume that a

fraction of real income is absorbed n the tax collection process. The
fraction, z, is a convex function of the ratio of taxesto real income:

' A similar approach is used by Greenwood (1983) and Kimbrough (1986).

Equation (2.1) is the well known random walk property of the marginal utility
of consumption, while (2.2) reveals that, since we assumed v" > 0, increases
in inflation are costly since they reduce desired cash balances as a fraction
of income.

The next step is to endogenize inflation by considering the optimization

problem of a government seeking to maximize the welfare of the representative

agent in the economy. In this case the authorities will choose the paths of
inflation, taxes and deficits which minimize the cost of raising the revenue

necessary to finance their expenditures. The period t budget constraint for
the government is given by:

As (2.3) reveals, the solution of this problem involves equating the
ratios of the marginal cost to the marginal revenue of the two alternative
financing instruments (since output is exogenous, the marginal revenue of
income taxes is one in this model). The optimum must be in the positively
sloped side of the inflation tax Laffer's curve, where the marginal revenue
from money creation is positive, i.e.

as

> 0. Equation (2.4) equates the

ratio of marginal cost to marginal revenue of the income tax today and in the

future. Equation (2.5) does the same for the inflation tax. In the special
case in which taxes are not distortionary, i.e. z —

This is Friedman's

optimum quantity of money rule. In this case seigniorage will be nil, and
government expenditure will be financed only through taxes. The opposite
extreme is one in which inflationary policy is non-distortionary, i.e. v

0.

In this case, as long as the marginal revenue from money financing is

positive, taxes will be set to zero. In the intermediate case in which both
types of financing are distortionary, we would expect that both will be used
to assure solvency.

In a recent paper, Kimbrough (1986) challenges the view that seigniorage

should be part of an optimal tax policy. He argues that, even if taxes are
distortionary, Friedman's optimal quantity of money rule should be followed.
In his model, inflation decreases the potential output of the economy, by
reducing the individual's time endowment (an hypothesis analogous to the one

we made above). On the other hand, he assumes that the only alternative
financing instrument is a consumption tax, which does not have the same direct
negative effect on the production possibility frontier (it alters the marginal
choice between consumption and leisure, but does not affect the total time

endowment). Because of this asymmetry, in that model it is optimal to refrain
from raising revenues through seigniorage.

In our model, instead, taxes and inflation lead to a similar contraction
of potential output, so that they are both used as financing instruments.

9

Moreover, because of the deadweight losses imposed by taxes and inflationary
finance, in our environment it is optimal to use deficits as a buffer for
temporary deviations of government expenditure from its permanent level.
Income taxes and inflation should be used to finance only the permanent part
of government expenditure, a generalization of the well-known tax smoothing

result obtained by Barro (1979). This result can be derived explicitly, by
assuming that the ratio of seigniorage to output can be expressed as a linear
function of inflation:

St — b,r
—
t

yt
and

that v(t) is a quadratic function of inflation:

2t

v—a+ air2.

Then, inflation, as well as the nominal interest rate and seigniorage, is a

martingale. The same is true for the income tax rate, under the assumption
that z(t) is quadratic2. Making use of the expectation operator, and assuming
for simplicity that the relevant covariance terms are equal to zero, we can
manipulate the government budget constraint at period t to give:

We can interpret the left-side ratio as the expected permanent fraction

solution, increases in this ratio imply increases in the rate of inflation,

I. Implications for Exchange Rate Behavior and Empirical Application

Consider a foreign country which is in all ways analogous to the domestic

economy.3 The exchange rate and the price levels in the two countries are
assumed to be linked by:

are the logarithms of nominal exchange rate, domestic and foreign

price level, respectively. In accord to a considerable body of empirical
evidence, we also assume that the deviations from purchasing power parity are
permanent in nature, i.e.:

Here we still maintain the assumption that the real interest rate is world
determined and cannot be effected by either of the two economies.

expenditure to output, respectively.

We now investigate whether the effects of fiscal policy on exchange rate
predicted by the above model can be detected for the dollar/pound rate.

The

data set used in this study is composed of annual observations, for the period

1870-1984. We argued above that temporary expenditure should be financed
through budget deficits. Therefore, empirically we identify the temporary
component of expenditure with the real deficit, defined as:

D —
t

B - B1
1t

(3.1)

1•t-1

where Bt is the amount of government bonds outstanding at time t. The
permanent component is given by the difference between the actual real
expenditure and its temporary element.4

We included in the specification not only permanent expenditures but also

In this paper we used government expenditure of the central government,
inclusive of interest payments and net of transfers The results, however, are
quite robust with respect to the choice of spending aggregate. Debt is total
debt outside the central bank. Appendix B provides a detailed description of
the data.

12

budget deficits as a percentage of output (d, dk). This allows us to test
whether, contrary to the above theory, they have had any effect on the

exchange rate. We also include government receipts as a

percentage of output

(r, rUk). The above model predicts that, once we control for permanent
spendings, government revenues should not have any independent effect on

inflation (exchange rate). However, unexpected shifts in the relative welfare
cost of the two financing instruments (i.e. changes in the z() and v()
functions) would induce switches between income taxes and inflation, for given

permanent government expenditure (see 2.3). Under these circumstances,
increases in revenue would imply a reduction in inflation and have an

appreciative effect on the exchange rate. The estimated exchange rate
equation had, therefore, the following form:

assumed to be independently normally distributed.

The time series of the exchange rate for this sample is plotted in Figure

1. As it is well known, and as Figure 1 evidences, periods of fixed exchange
regimes have alternated with periods of flexible rates. In table 1, we report
the estimate of (3.2) obtained by using only data corresponding to periods of

flexible exchange rates. Both permanent expenditures are significant and have
the expected signs. Moreover, U.S. revenues appear to have had a significant
(appreciative) effect on the dollar, indicating that shifts in the relative
cost function may have occurred in the U.S..

Even if our data set extends over 115 years, the above estimate are based

13

only on 25 data points. This is because, for most of the sample, the exchange
rate was fixed, making it difficult to detect the effects of changes in

government expenditure. In the next section it will be shown how to improve
our estimates by properly utilizing the information contained in periods of

fixed exchange rates. For the moment, however, assume that one ignores the
problem of the existence of periods of fixed exchange rates, and uses ordinary

least squares to estimate equation (3.2) over the whole period 1870-1984. The

results of this experiment are reported in Table 2. The results are very
similar to the one obtained above. Both U.S. and U.K. permanent expenditures
have the expected sign and are significantly different from zero at least at

the 5% level. Of the other variables, U.S. government revenues seem to have a
significant impact on the exchange rate.

4. Censored Regression Models With Unobserved Thresholds

During period of fixed exchange rates, variations in permanent
expenditure would not be reflected in exchange rate changes.

This does not

imply, however, that the study of these periods cannot provide any useful

information about our theory. On the contrary, the type of exchange rate
system may be itself a function of the level of government expenditure.

Periods of moderate spending (taking the conditions in the other country as
given), and therefore of moderate monetization, can be compatible with a fixed

parity. On the other hand, continuous or substantial increases in permanent
expenditure may undermine the viability of a fixed exchange rate system,
producing its collapse and a switch to a floating regime.

For example, if we

divide the observation into two groups depending on whether they belong to
periods of fixed or flexible exchange rates, we notice that, while the U.S.

14

has essentially the same average level of expenditure in the two subsets (6.5%
of output during fixed and 8.1% during flexible rates) the U.K.'s average
expenditure is considerably higher during flexible rate periods (15.5% vs.
22.1%).

The issue of collapsing exchange rate regimes has been extensively

analyzed by the speculative attack literature.5 The focus there is to
determine the timing and the magnitude of a devaluation (revaluation), which
is seen as the consequence of an attack on the official reserves by rational

speculators. One of the main insights of this literature is that the crucial
variable determining a switch from fixed to flexible exchange rate regime is

the shadow exchange rate, i.e. the equilibrium exchange that would prevail in
the post-collapse floating regime. Assuming that only a dollar revaluation is
possible (as it has been the case in our sample), we can describe the
condition for the viability of a fixed exchange rate as:

>

(4.1)

i.e., the rate of growth of the shadow exchange rate (e) must be above some

minimum level (e
). By definition,
in a £lexible exchange rate regime the

.

shadow and the actual rate coincide

,

i.e.

—

If the shadow rate were

observable during the period of fixed rate, we could estimate (3.2) by using

such data. The problem is that the floating shadow is not observable during
fixed exchange rate regimes, since

is observable only if:

(1986).

Therefore, in part of the sample

that the OLS estimates are both biased and inconsistent. The way in which we
propose to estimate (3.2) is to consider

as a censored regression (x1t is the 7 x 1 vector of the fiscal variables, and
is the 7 x 1 vector of parameters) where the threshold

the data are censored, is itself unobservable. It is assumed, however, that
we observe the variables determining it, that is:

sample observations into three distinct groups. The first group is composed

In order to

obtain consistent estimates to use as starting values in the maximum
likelihood procedure, we used a variant of a two-stage method described by

Maddala (1983). A description of this estimator is given in Appendix A.
The estimates of the parameters obtained by maximizing (4.2) are given in
Table 3, where x2 is composed of the lagged difference between the ratios of
permanent expenditures to output of the two countries (óg) and the fixed
parity (a).

These maximum likelihood estimates would seem to support the

theory of optimal financing as a partial explanation of the movements of the

Dollar/Pund exchange rate between 1870 and 1984. In fact, the two permanent
expenditure ratios are both significant and have the expected sign. A one
percent increase in the ratio of U.S. permanent expenditure to output induces

17

a three percent devaluation in the dollar. On the other hand, a one percent
increase in the ratio of British permanent government expenditure to output

revalues the dollar by almost one percent. U.S. revenue, on the other hand,
seem to have lost part of their explanatory power.

5. Conclusions

A novel aspect of this paper is the choice of the time period in which

the empirical investigation is conducted. Previous studies have mainly
concentrated on the post Bretton Woods flexible exchange rate system. In this
paper, we make use of econometric techniques that exploit information

contained in data from periods of fixed exchange rates. Thus, our empirical

analysis ranges from the 1870's to the 1980's. The study of this extended
time period is of particular importance since major changes in the nominal
exchange rates seem to be connected with major changes in government
expenditure, like the ones occurring during war times.

The results of this paper suggest that the permanent components of public
expenditures have been a crucial factor in driving the evolution of the

dollar/pound rate in the last hundred and fifteen years. U.S. revenues also
contribute to the explanation of exchange rate movements, indicating possible
changes overtime of the welfare cost of alternative financing instruments.
Moreover, the paper provides further evidence in favor of the thesis of
irrelevance of budget deficits in the determination of nominal variables.
