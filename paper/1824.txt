bnetary Policies in Interdependent Economies with
Stochastic Disturbances: A Strategic Aiproach

ABSTRC

This paper analyzes strategic monetary policies using a standard two

country stochastic macro model. Three noncooperative equilibria, namely
Cournot, Stackelberg, and Consistent Conjectural Variations, are considered.
The Pareto Optimal equilibrium, where aggregate joint costs are minimized
is also considered, and all strategic equilibria are compared to the per-

fectly fixed and flexible exchange rate regimes. The main conclusions
obtained are:

(1) Demand shocks are much less problematical than supply

disturbances from the viewpoint of macro stabilization; (ii) the gains
from cooperation are typically small; (iii) the strategic equilibria all
show substantial margins of superiority over the fixed and flexible regimes.

1. INTRODUCTION
Western economies have become increasingly interdependent during recent

years. An important consequence of this is that the effects of macroeconomic
policies within these economies have become more closely related. A policy
implemented in one country will generate effects abroad, while the impacts of
this policy on the domestic economy are modified by the behavior and policies of

the foreign economies with which it is interacting. Thus policy making in a
multicountry context necessarily involves strategic behavior.

Analysis of strategic behavior within the context of international macroeconomic policy began with the pioneering work of Hamada (1976), who investigated strategic behavior under the assumptions of Cournot and Stackelberg

behavior. His analysis is based on a fixed exchange rate regime and the objec—
tiqe futetion involves the tradeoff between inflation and the balance of pay-

ments. More recently, Canzoneri and Gray (1985) consider alternative strategic
monetary policies within the context of two economies subject to a mutual oil
disturbance.1

This paper continues the analysis of strategic monetary policy. The framework it employs is a two country stochastic macro model in which both economies
are subjected to stochastic demand and supply shocks and expectations are

rational.2 The policy makers in the two countries seek to optimize their
respective objective functions, which are taken to be functions of unanticipated

movements in output and in the consumer price index. The model begins by determining the usual Cournot and Stackelberg equilibria for this model. However,
these represent just two possible equilibria, and a number of alternatives are

also considered. In particular, in the derivation of the Cournot equilibrium,
each agent takes the behavior of his opponent as given, and therefore assumes

that his rival does not react to his actions. On the other hand, each agent is

—2—

shown to respond in accordance with a reaction function, so that ex post, the

assumption of no response is incorrect. By contrast, we also consider a Consistent Conjectural Variations equilibrium (CCV) in which each policy maker, in
determining his own actions, correctly conjectures the response of his opponent.
The requirement of consistency is an appealing.one, and we therefore find this
equilibrium concept to be a particularly interesting one.3

These three equilibrium concepts are all non—cooperative; agents behave in
their own self interests under alternative strategic assumptions. We also con-

sider a number of cooperative solutions. The first of these is where the agents
choose to maximize their joint aggregate welfare. However, as Canzoneri and
Gray and others have argued, cooperative equilibria may be hard to enforce in
that the individual agents may have incentives to cheat and break the rules of
the game.

Finally, two alternative forms of monetary regimes are considered, namely,

perfectly flexible and perfectly fixed exchange rates. These represent the traditional regimes in both international macroeconomic theory and policy discus-

sions. And although they are not usually viewed in this way, they can be
regarded as representing cooperative behavior. In the first of these, the
policy makers in the two economies agree to do nothing, allowing the exchange

rate to respond freely to market pressures. In the latter, they agree to intervene mutually in the exchange market to maintain a fixed rate. In fact, this
rate can be pegged by coordinating their policies in an infinite number of ways,
and one natural alternative is considered in this paper.

An important objective of the analysis is to compare the relative merits of the

various equilibria. In the process of doing this, we touch upon the old debate
of fixed versus flexible rates, but our analysis can be viewed as embedding this

—3—

discussion within a larger class of equilibrium concepts. Our analysis also
addresses the more topical issue concerning the gains from cooperation over the
alternative noncooperative equilibria.

The theoretical framework is outlined in Section 2, with the four strategic

equilibria being discussed in Sections 3—6. Insofar as possible, our study is
conducted analytically. Because of their complexity, the formal

expressions

characterizing the optimal policies and equilibria provide only limited insight
and to obtain further understanding we combine the formal analysis of the model

with numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis.4 These numerical procedures
are outlined in Section 7, while Sections 8 and 9 undertake the numerical solu-

tions and the sensitivity analysis. The main conclusions and general comments
are given in Section 10.

2. THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

The analysis is based on the following two country macroeconomic model,
which is a direct extension of the recent stochastic rational expectations open
economy framework; see e.g., papers in Bhandari (1985).

It describes two iden-

tical economies, each specializing in the production of a distinct good and

trading a single common bond.5 In deviation form, it is expressed by the
following equations:

u = stochastic shift in demand,
v = stochastic

shift in supply.

Domestic variables are unstarred; foreign variables are denoted with asterisks.
We shall also refer to these as Country 1 and Country 2, respectively.

Equations (1) and (1') describe equilibrium in the two goods markets. Output depends upon the real interest rate, output in the other country, the rela-

tive price, and the stochastic shift in demand. The corresponding effects
across the two economies are identical and the relative price influences demand

in exactly offsetting ways. The money market equilibrium conditions in the two

—5—

countries are standard and described by (2) and (2') respectively.6 It is trivial to modify these relationships to allow for shifts in the money demand analo-

gous to u and Vt. Such shifts can simply be absorbed in the money supply M and
accommodated for directly in any money supply adjustment rule.7 The perfect substitutability between domestic and foreign bonds is described by the interest

rate condition (3). Equations (4) and (4') describe the consumer price index
(CPI) in the two economies. They embody the assumption that in each country a
proportion 5 of income is spent on the respective home good. We assume that
residents of each country have a preference for their own good, so that 5 > 1/2.

Note that the real interest rate in (1) and (1'), and the real money supplies in
(2) and (2') are deflated by the output price of the respective economies.

Little would be changed, except for additional detail, if the deflators were in

terms of their respective CPI's.8 Finally, equations (5) and (5') describe outputs in the two economies in terms of standard Lucas supply functions; the
deviation in output from its natural rate is postulated to be a positive function of the unanticipated movement in the price of output, together with the
stochastic shift in supply.
The stochastic variables, u, v, u, v, are assumed to be independently dis-

tributed with zero means.

If in addition, as in fact turns out to be the case,

and M depend only on these current disturbances, then as is well known, the
rational expectations solution to the system (1) — (5) implies that
=

,t(Et+5) = 0 for all t, s

(6)

The exchange rate and price level in all future periods are both expected

to remain constant. The fact that this constant is zero, is simply a consequence of specifying the system in deviation form. In particular, setting s = 1
in (6), yields
=

(E+1) =

0 for all t

One further important feature is that the shifts u, u, v, v are assumed to
be observed at time t and therefore to determine the policy makers' decisions at

Equations (1) —

together with (6) describe the structure of the two

economies. The policy makers in these economies are assumed to minimize quadratic cost functions specified in terms of unanticipated deviations in output

and the CPI from their respective expected levels. Under the assumptions on the
underlying stochastic variables, these expectations are all zero. Thus the
respective functions to be optimized are simply

(8c) have several interesting features. First, the sym-

metry of the underlying economies is reflected in the symmetry of these reduced

form solutions. As expected, an increase in M, as well as positive disturbances in domestic demand u or supply v lead to increases in domestic output.

A positive foreign demand shock u also leads to an increase in domestic output,
although by a lesser amount than when the demand shock is of doniectic origin. The

reason for the positive spillover is that an increase in u leads to an appreciation
of the foreign currency (depreciation of the domestic currency), thereby stimulating

demand for domestic output and domestic output itself. The effect of an increase in
the foreign money supply on domestic output, 2' and vice versa, is highly indeterminate. This is because, on the one hand, an increase in Mt raises foreign output and demand, giving rise to the usual positive spillover onto domestic demand

and output. But at the same time, the foreign monetary expansion leads to a
depreciation of the foreign currency (appreciation of the domestic currency).

This leads to an increase in the relative price of domestic goods, thereby

leading to a contraction in domestic demand and output. This 'negative trans—
mission" mechanism is a familiar one, dating back to early work by Mundell

(1963). The direction of the net effect is given by

our numerical work below to make the distinction between UlargeT and "small"
values of d3.

The other interesting point to note is that the exchange rate responds

purely to differentials between the domestic and foreign variables. Any shock,
or policy change, which is common to both economies, leaves the exchange rate
unchanged.

Combining the solutions (8a)—(8c) with (4), (4'), (6), (6') and substituting into (5), (5'), the solutions for the CPI are

By raising domestic output demand and causing the domestic currency to depre—

ciate, a domestic monetary expansion raises the domestic CPI. By contrast, a
foreign monetary expansion causes the domestic currency to appreciate, which
together with the likely negative output transmission effects, generally (but
not always) causes the domestic CPI to fall.

3. OPTIMAL STRATEGIES

Th pima1 po14cy problem o'f n4rg 'ach of the policy makers is to
choose their respective nominal money supplies to minimize their cost functions

(7), (7') subject to the constraints (8a), (8b), (9a), (9b). A key feature in
the determination of the equilibrium concerns the strategic behavior and the
following equilibria will be derived.

A. Cournot
Under the Cournot assumption, each policy maker chooses his money supp',y so

as to minimize his respective cost function, taking the behavior of his opponent

as remaining fixed. Taking partial derivatives of (7), (7'), respectively, this
gives rise to the optimality conditions.'°

This in fact turns out to be so for 49 of the 50 parameter sets we

implying that a monetary expansion in one country induces a monetary expansion
in the other.

The shifts in domestic demand and supply impact directly upon domestic output
through the aggregate demand and the aggregate supply functions, respectively.

Equations (12) indicate that one component of the optimal monetary policies in
the two economies is to contract the money supply sufficiently to ensure that
the domestic interest rate rises so as to neutralize exactly these effects on

output.11 These adjustments are described by the terms —a2u/d2 —
(l2a) and ._a2u*/d2 —

in

in (12b). We shall refer to these as being the

"direct shift" component of the optimal policy rules. But, in addition, the
shocks are transmitted across the two economies through movements in the
exchange rate (relative price movements) and the policy responses themselves.
These effects are incorporated in the terms involving (u_u*), ('Y11v —

the domestic economy, and the analogous expressions for the foreign country. We
shall refer to these as being the "interactive" component of the optimal policy
rule.

—12--

A. Demand Shocks
It is interesting to note that these interactive components of the demand

shifts require totally symmetric adjustments in the two economies. It can be

verified by direct evaluation that 13 —

< 0, so that in

response to a positive domestic demand shock, say, the domestic monetary
authority should expand its money supply in response to the interactive effect,
thereby offsetting (but only partially) the initial contraction in response to

the direct shift effect.12 At the same time, the foreign monetary authority
should contract its money supply, doing so by an amount which exactly matches
the interactive component of the domestic authority's response.

The reason for this is as follows. From the reduced form solutions, (8), it
is seen that the net effect of the initial expansion in domestic demand, together
with the direct monetary contraction, on domestic output is dY =

— a2c,/d2

<

0.

By neglecting the relative price effect and policy interaction, the domestic
monetary authority overcontracts its money supply and domestic output falls.

At the same time, both the demand expansion and the initial domestic monetary
contraction cause the domestic exchange rate to appreciate; i.e., the foreign

currency depreciates, thereby inducing an expansion abroad. In order to stabilize
the foreign economy, the foreign monetary authority contracts its money thereby
now causing an appreciation of the foreign currency, with positive spillovers to the

domestic economy. Furthermore, by now expanding its money supply, the domestic
monetary authority is able to correct for the initial overcontraction which
occurred.

The second demand shock of interest is that of a worldwide expansion, shared
equally by the two economies, so that u =

u.

In this case, the optimal

response is simply for each policy maker to contract his money supply to neutralize

—13—

the effects of the disturbance in his economy. There are in effect no relative
price spillover effects to be taken into account.

The solutions for output and inflation in the two economies are reported in

equations (A.l) and (A.6) of the Appendix. From these equations we see that
after each policy maker has accommodated the direct disturbances in his own econ—
omy, output, inflation, and therefore welfare costs, in the two economies depend
upon the difference between the domestic and foreign demand shocks, viz (u_u*).

This again is a consequence of the symmetry of the two economies. Consider a
domestic demand shock u > 0. After allowing for the contractions in the money
supply which occur both at home and abroad, output in the home economy rises,

while output abroad falls. At the same time, the domestic CPI falls and the CPI
abroad increases. Basically, this is because of the appreciation of the domestic
currency, which more than offsets the pusiLiv effects of the domestic demand
expansion on the price of domestic output.

The most interesting feature of these results is the perfect symmetry of the

demand effects across the two economies. A unit shift in demand in Country 1,
say, has precisely equal and opposite effects on output and the CPI in the two

economies. The welfare effects, as measured by the quadratic objective functions,
are therefore equally borne by both economies. A further consequence is that if
the two economies are both subjected to identical shifts in demand, reflecting a
worldwide demand shift, then the monetary authorities need simply neutralize the

direct effects of these shocks in their respective economies. This will ensure
that the output level and CPI in the two economies remain pegged at their respective

equilibrium levels. Welfare costs are minimized at zero; both economies will
attain their respective Bliss points.

B. Supply Shocks
The adjustments to the interactive components of the supply shocks are not

perfectly symmetric. A positive shock in domestic supply requires a domestic

—14—

monetary expansion, in order to adjust for the effects of the initial (direct)
monetary contraction, namely —(l+c2)v/-y. The reasoning for this is essentially

analogous to that for demand shocks, described above. The combined effects of
the positive supply shock and the direct monetary contraction on output are
=

0;

i.e., they are exactly offsetting. On the other hand, they

lead to an appreciation of the domestic currency, leading to a reduction in the

domestic CPI. Given the quadratic cost function, domestic welfare is improved
by now increasing the money supply, thereby moderating the reduction in the
domestic CPI and requiring output to increase somewhat.

The overall effects of the domestic supply shock on the domestic money
supply depends critically upon a, the relative cost of output stability in the

welfare function. If this is large, the expansionary component is dominated by
Lhe direct cnntra.tiUnary component and on balance, the money stock in the

domestic economy falls. However, if the objective function is weighted towards
price stability, the expansionary effect is the dominant one, leading to an
overall increase in the domestic money supply.

The response abroad, or equivalently the domestic response to a foreign
supply shock, depends upon whether 'F12

0. Taking the more likely case where

'F12 < 0, so that the reaction functions are positively sloped, we see that the
increase in the domestic money supply resulting from the interactive component,
leads to a monetary expansion abroad.

The net effect of a positive domestic supply shock on the two economies is

seen in equations (A.4). Output at home and abroad both increase, with the
domestic effect being larger. At the same time, the CPI's in the two economies
will fall, with again the greater effect being in the domestic economy. Thus,
in contrast to the perfectly symmetric effects of a single country demand shock,

a domestic supply shock has significantly greater effect on the output and CPI

—15—

of the domestic economy than it does on the foreign economy. The welfare costs
are therefore borne more heavily by the economy in which the shock is taking
place.

Worldwide supply shifts, experienced equally by both economies, generate

equal output and CPI effects in the two countries. The nominal exchange rate
remains unchanged. The effects of the shocks in the two economies compound one
another, making the attainment of the Bliss point (zero welfare costs)

impossible. In this respect, worldwide supply shocks impose a much more serious
stabiliiation policy problem than do worldwide demand shocks.

4. STACKELBERG EQUILIBRIUM
In deriving the Stackelberg equilibrium we shall treat Country 1 as the

leader, with Country 2 being the follower. The procedure is familiar. Country
1 optimizes its welfare function subject to the reaction curve of the follower.
The solutions for the optimal policies and the outputs and inflation rates are

of the same general form as for the Cournot case. However, since the expressions
turn out to be rather involved, and not particularly enlightening, we merely
summarize their main qualitative aspects.
First, part of the adjustment of the policy instruments should be to accommodate to the "direct shift" terms, just as was the case in the Cournot equil-

ibrium. Secondly, the demand shifts u, u enter the "interactive" component of
the optimal rules symmetrically, although in contrast to the Cournot case, the

coefficients are different for the leader than for the follower. Thirdly,
because of this symmetry, if both economies are subject to identical shifts in
demand, then the monetary authorities in each country need simply neutralize the

direct effects of the demand shifts in their own economy. This will ensure the
attainment of the Bliss point.

—16--

Supply shifts are more complicated. First, domestic and foreign disturbances
enter asymmetrically. Moreover, they impact differently on the leader from the
follower. A variety of patterns regarding the effects of the supply shifts on
outputs and inflation in the two countries are found and are noted further
in Section 8 below.

5. CONSISTENT CONJECTURAL VARIATIONS
Under Cournot behavior, each policy maker assumes that the other does not

respond to his actions. In fact, however, each policy maker will respond in
accordance with his reaction curve. The Cournot equilibrium is therefore con—
sistently wrong in predicting the response of the rival. The CCV equilibrium
assumes that each agent, in choosing his own strategy, takes the response of his

rival into account. Furthermore, the response is correctly anticipated and
hence the solution corresponds to a rational expectations equilibrium.

12 > 0, the two roots lie in the range

< 0. Thus there are two equilibria which correspond to con-

sistent conjectural variations. In the case of country—specific supply shocks
these equilibria may give rise to conflicts in' welfare for the two economies.

One solution is better for one country, while the other equilibrium is preferable

for the other. In this case we choose solution having lower aggregate welfare
costs as the equilibrium.

The solutions for output and CPI in the two countries are obtained by
substituting (l7a), (17b) into(8a,b), (9a,b), with the resulting expressions

—19--

being reported in the equations (A.2) of the Appendix. Since the qualitative
properties of both the optimal rules and the behavior of the economy are similar
to those under Cournot, we do not discuss these expressions further at this
time.

6. COOPERATIVE EQUILIBRIA

alternative forms of cooperative equilibria.

As in the previous forms of strategic behavior, the optimal rules require
the neutralization of what we have termed the direct shift terms —ct2u/d2
—(l+a2)vI',', _ci2u*/d2 —

(l+d2)v*/y.

In addition, the interaction components ex-

hibit the same general characteristics as in the other equilibria, although the
magnitudes of the adjustments are modified.'3

(1) Demand Shocks: The interactive components of the demand shocks are perfectly
symmetrical, with the coefficient of (u_u*) in the domestic (foreign) monetary
policy function being positive (negative), but smaller in magnitude than the

direct effect. Thus both the domestic and foreign economies should contract
their respective money supplies in response to a domestic demand shock, with

the same reasoning as for the Cournot equilibrium continuing to apply. However,
in contrast to the Cournot equilibrium, relatively more of the adjustment is
shifted to the foreign economy.

The effects of the demand shocks on output and CPI in the two economies are

given by (A.3a), (A.3b). As before, the effects depend upon the difference the
domestic and foreign demand shifts. The net effect of a shift in domestic
demand is to increase domestic output and to reduce output abroad. The domestic
CPI falls and the foreign CPI rises. The less balanced monetary adjustments in
the two economies (relative to the Cournot equilibrium), and the fact that output is more sensitive to the domestic, rather than the foreign, money
stock, means the rise in domestic output and fall in foreign output are both

—21—

larger than under Cournot. A further consequence of the less balanced adjustment is that appreciation of the domestic currency is reduced so that the

adjustments in the domestic and foreign CPI are reduced. In short, cooperation
leads to more variation in output accompanied by less variation in the CPI than

in the Cournot equilibrium. The same comparison holds with respect to the CCV
equilibrium. The symmetry with respect to demand shifts across the two economies,
obtained in the previous equilibria, holds in the cooperative solution as well.

(ii) Supply Shocks: As before, the symmetry associated with demand shifts does

not apply. Moreover, the appropriate response of the money supply to both
domestic and foreign shocks depends critically upon the relative weight, a,

assigned to output stability in the objective function. The reasoning is basically as for the Cournot equilibrium, discussed above.

The net effect of the domestic supply shock, together with the policy
responses, is to raise domestic output, with the effect on the foreign output

being indeterminate. On the one hand, the expansion in the domestic economy
generates positive spillovers abroad. On the other hand, the monetary contractions, typically conducted in the two economies, tend to generate contractionary

effects. The supply shock always reduces the CPI in both economies, with the
effect in the domestic economy being the numerically larger. Overall, the
foreign adjustment to the domestic supply shock is less than that of the
domestic economy, so that under cooperation, the greater instability, and therefore the greater welfare losses, are incurred by the domestic economy.
Moreover, relative to the Cournot equilibrium, we find that domestic welfare is

increased, while foreign welfare declines. The economy experiencing the supply
shock therefore gains from cooperation, while its partner loses. This is a consequence of the fact that the shift is confined to one country; ifit occurs in
both, then both economies are better off under cooperation.

—22—

B. Flexible Exchange Rate

An important form of monetary cooperation arises when the policy makers in
the two countries agree to do nothing. This of course is the case of a perfectly flexible exchange rate and is specified by

M =

=0

(21)

It serves as a useful benchmark case.

C. Fixed Exchange Rate
The other extreme form of cooperation is where the monetary authorities in
the two countries agree to maintain a fixed exchange rate, at E = 0 say. From
(8c) this is attained when

+

'

(v—v')

= 0

In general there are an infinite number of combinations of intervention which
will satisfy this condition, and these in general all produce different welfare

costs. Given the symmetry of the two economies, we shall consider the most
natural candidate,'5

7. NUMERICAL PROCEDURES
The parameters appearing in the optimal policies and solutions are them-

selves complex functions of the underlying parameters of the model. While we
have been able to characterize the various equilibria in some detail, to gain

—23—

further insight into the general welfare implications of the different regimes,

we resort to numerical analysis.

Part A indicates two sets of base parameter values. These are chosen on the
basis of reasonable empirical evidence. The elasticity of the demand for
domestic output with respect to foreign output is d1 =

.3;

the semi—elasticity

of the demand for output with respect to the real interest rate is d2 =

.5;

the

income elasticity of the demand for money is a1 = 1; the semi—elasticity of the
demand for money with respect to the nominal interest rate is .5; the share of
domestic output in domestic consumption

.6 for both economies; the slopes of

the supply functions are 4/3; the relative weights given to output stabilization
in the objective function is a =

.75.

The choice of the relative price elasticity d3 is more problematical. Our
initial chosen value was d3 = 1, which is close to that assumed by others.16
However, for d3 = 1, we find that 2'

cally, relative to •,
small relative to

both turn out to be very small numeri-

n1, a consequence of which is that both y12, 22' are
The significance of all this is that the effects of

policies within the economy overwhelm the effects of these policies abroad. The
linkages between the economies is weak, so that the interaction between the

policy makers is small. In this situation, the differences between the strategic equilibria are minimal. In all cases, the welfare differences between say
the Cournot and the Pareto optimal cooperative equilibria are less than 1 percent for demand disturbances and 2 percent for supply disturbances; see Tables

2B, 3B, 5B. To a first approximation, each policy maker can act in isolation
and it does not matter very much how his rival responds.

For values of d3 larger than 1, the strategic equilibria continue to be

close and this is true for all variations of the other parameter sets. One
conclusion of this is that for d3 > 1, the gains from cooperation are extremely

—24--

modest, a conclusion which is also consistent with some of the simulations of Oudiz

and Sachs (1984). At the same time, the gains from any form of strategic behavior over
simple rules such as fixed or flexible exchange rates, are significant. As d3
declines, we find that 'V12, 22' increase in size relative to q11 and greater

divergence between the equilibria results. Thus as our preferred values we take

.1,

d3 =

although we recognize that this may be somewhat low.

While these values seem reasonable, they are arbitrary. In Part B of Table
1 we therefore consider variants of these values allowing the parameters to

range between low and high values. To consider all combinations of these
parameter values would be impractical. Our approach is therefore to begin with
the base parameter set and to introduce one parameter change at a time. Combining these with the two values d3 =

.1,

d3 =

sets, which can be identified from Table 1.

1, gives a total of 50 parameter

Introducing the parameter changes

singly in this way enables a numerical form of comparative statics to be performed.

8. ALTERNATIVE EQUILIBRIA: BASE PARAMETER SET
Tables 2—5 summarize the equilibria resulting from various types of

stochastic disturbances, for the base parameter sets. In addition to the four
strategic equilibria, we also present the extremes of the perfectly flexible and

perfectly fixed exchange rates. Results for the other parameter sets are available from the authors. These tables summarize the optimal monetary policies,
the responses of the key macro variables Y, Y, E, C, C', as well as the implied
welfare costs. In the case of the Stackelberg equilibrium Country 1 is the
leader and Country 2 is the follower. We have already commented on how the CCV
requirement gives rise to two equilibria.

In the case of a single country

supply shock, these equilibria may give rise to a conflict from a welfare point

of view. We have chosen the Pareto superior solution.

-25A.

Demand Disturbances

Table 2 reports the numerical solution in the case where Country 1 is subject to a 10 unit positive random shock in demand.

Consider as a benchmark, the case of a perfectly flexible exchange rate. In
the absence of intervention, the increase in demand in Country 1 leads to an
increase in the output of Country 1, together with an appreciation of its

currency. The latter is of sufficient magnitude to lead to a reduction in the
domestic CPI. At the same time, the increase in domestic output and the
appreciation of the domestic currency stimulates demand and output abroad, and

puts upward pressure on the foreign CPI. Overall, the accommodation in the
world economy to the monetary shock in Country 1 is accomplished by a relatively
large quantity adjustment in Country 1, together with a relatively large price
adjustment in Country 2.

Now suppose that each policy maker follows Cournot behavior. In particular,
both countries respond to the stimulus in demand by decreasing their respective

money stocks. This will tend to moderate the increase in output in Country 1
and in fact cause a decline in output in Country 2. At the same time, the relatively larger monetary contraction abroad moderates the depreciation of the

foreign currency, thereby moderating the increase in its CPI. By shifting the
relative adjustment away from output and towards the CPI in Country 1, and the

reverse in Country 2, the welfare costs are reduced in both cases. This is an
immediate consequence of the quadratic cost function.
In reaching the Cournot equilibrium, each policy maker assumes that his

opponent will not react. In the CCV solution, each policy maker correctly takes

account of his opponent's reaction. The slope of Country 2s reaction function
is (for d3 =

'12'1l

=

.172, while the slope of the consistency conjectured

reaction is x = .162, which is flatter. Thus with consistent
conjectures,

—26—

Country 1 correctly expects less monetary contraction on the part of Country 2
in response to its own

contraction,

and therefore contracts more itself. The

reverse applies in Country 2. The slope of the consistently conjectured reaction of Country 1 is steeper than Country l's reaction function.

Country 2 expects a greater contraction by Country 1 than indicated by the reac-

tion function, and therefore contracts less itself. The consequences of this
are that the Increase in output in Country 1, and the decrease in Country 2, are

both moderated, relative to the Cournot equilibrium. The appreciation of
Country l's currency is increased and this leads to greater variations in the

CPI. Given the quadratic cost functions the move towards less output variation
and more price variation leads to lower welfare in both economies.

The Stackelberg solution involves a degree of cooperation in that each

player assumes a specific role. The leader is aware of the follower's reaction
function and the fact that the latter will contract his money supply, less than

proportionately, in response to his own monetary contraction. This increases
the appreciation of the domestic currency (relative to the Cournot equilibrium).

Welfare in Country 1 is increased. Fluctuations in both output and CPI in
Country 2 are increased, resulting in a welfare loss abroad.

All of the Cournot, Stackelberg, and CCV equilibria involve relatively low
variations in output, accompanied by relatively large fluctuations in the CPI.

Given the quadratic cost function, both countries can be made better off by
cooperating, with Country 1 contracting less, and Country 2 contracting more.

This arrangement leads to larger fluctuations in output, but smaller fluctuations in the exchange rate and CPI, leading to a higher overall level of
welfare.

Finally, the authorities can achive a perfectly fixed exchange rate with an
appropriate monetary expansion in Country 1, matched by an equivalent contrac-

tion abroad. This shifts more the adjustment in Country 1 to output and less to

—27—

the

CPI, which given the relative weight in the objective function, reduces

domestic welfare. On the other hand, the stable exchange rate eliminates the
key mechanism whereby the domestic disturbance is transmitted abroad. Thus from
the viewpoint of the foreign economy, the fixed exchange rate is the preferred
regime.

The results where the demand disturbances occur in the foreign country are

symmetrical and need not be discussed. Also,

the

case of a worldwide shift in

demand, giving rise to identical shifts in the two countries, leads to the
attainment of the Bliss point (zero cost equilibrium) as demonstrated previously.

B. Supply Disturbances
The equilibria for positive supply disturbances are reported in Tables 3—5.

Like the demand shocks these are assumed to be 10 units in magnitude. Turning
first to the case of a domestic supply disturbance, it is clear that in all
equilibria the adjustment is borne overwhelmingly by the domestic economy, with
only modest effects being transmitted abroad.

To see why this is so, it is useful to begin with the benchmark case of a

flexible exchange rate. The positive domestic supply shock leads to an increase
in domestic output. The effect abroad can either be positive or negative,
depending upon whether the positive direct spillover effect dominates the nega-

tive relative price effect. If the former dominates, foreign output rises,
forcing up the foreign interest rate and causing the foreign currency to appre-

ciate. If the latter dominates, foreign output falls and the foreign currency
depreciates. In either case, the effect on foreign output is small quantitatively, relative to the domestic. At the same time, the expansion in domestic
output puts downward pressure on the domestic CPI, this being larger when the
dominance of the relative price effect causes the domestic currency to appreciate.

—28—

Likewise,

the foreign CPI falls, this being larger when the dominance of the

direct spillover effect brings about an appreciation of the foreign currency.

Consider now the Cournot equilibrium. The domestic economy contracts its
money supply, while the foreign economy expands. This tends to moderate the

increase in output in Country 1, although exacerbating the fall in CPI. Given the
weight in the objective function, this is a desirable tradeoff. The combination of a
domestic monetary contraction coupled with a foreign expansion, generates a

depreciation of the foreign currency, stimulating output abroad somewhat, but

stemming the fall in foreign CPI substantially. This too is desirable from a
welfare viewpoint.

For reasons discussed above, in the CCV equilibrium, the domestic monetary
contraction is increased while the expansion abroad is decreased, relative to

Cournot. This increases the appreciation of the domestic currency. Domestic
and foreign outputs are less unstable; the fall in domestic CPI is increased,

while the foreign CPI is stabilized. Welfare is improved in both economies.
The Stackelberg equilibrium is close to the CCV, with both the leader and
follower being better off than under Cournot.

The Cooperative equilibrium calls for less variation in output accompanied

by greater variation in CPI. This can be achieved by the domestic economy
increasing its monetary contraction and the foreign economy, reducing its rate

of expansion, or even contracting its money supply modestly. Such an equilibrium
is certainly welfare improving for the domestic economy, although the foreign

economy is made worse off. Without compensation, the latter has an incentive to
cheat. However, the gains to Country 1 are sufficient to enable it to compen—
sate the foreign country and still make both better off.

Finally, the fixed rate, achieved by an equivalent contraction in 1 and

expansion in 2 significantly destabilizes output in both economies. Welfare

—29—

costs are increased, relative to all four strategic equilibria. Whether the
fixed rate is worse than the flexible depends in part upon d3.

In the situation where the supply shock occurs in the foreign economy, for
all but the Stackelberg equilibrium, the responses are symmetric to those
arising from supply disturbances in the domestic economy, and are not reported.

The Stackelberg equilibrium in which the supply shock occurs in the follower

economy is given in Table 4. The appropriate policies are approximately the
same as if the shock occurs in the domestic economy; the money supply in the

domestic economy should be contracted, while the money supply abroad (the

country experiencing the shock) should be expanded. Most of the welfare costs
are then forced onto the foreign economy.

Finally, Table 5 illustrates the case of a worldwide supply disturbance

which impinges equally on the two economies. Except in the Stackelberg
equilibrium, the symmetry of the shock leaves the exchange rate unchanged, so

that the fixed and flexible regimes are identical. All strategic equilibria
call for monetary contraction. The three noncooperative equilibria lead to
insufficient monetary contraction, with too much variation in output and too

little in the CPI. In the cooperative equilibrium, the increase in monetary
contraction shifts the adjustment from output to inflation, resulting in welfare
improvements to both economies.

9. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

Table

6 summarizes the welfare rankings of the alternative equilibria for

the base parameter set. With one exception, the rankings of the four strategic
equilibria, Cournot (N), Stackelberg (S), CCV

and Cooperative (C) hold across

all parameter sets, although in some cases the differences are quantiatively

negligible. The exception is the case d2 =

.01, when for domestic demand

disturbances, the Stackelberg leadership dominates the Cooperative equilibrium.

—30—

The relative rankings of the fixed and flexible regimes are more parameter sen—

sitive. For example, for extremely large values of d2, the fixed regime becomes
the worst equilibrium for a country facing foreign demand disturbances, rather

than the preferred equilibrium, as in the base case. Also, while the flexible
rate generally does not perform particularly well, it is the preferred equilibrium
for an economy confronting its own supply shocks, provided the objective is
weighted primarily towards price stability.

In Table 7 we have summarized the qualitative effects of changes in the
parameters across the sample sets, on the welfare costs in the two economies.

These effects are straightforward and space limitations preclude any detailed

discussion. However, the following general observations can be made.
(i) In almost all cases, the four strategic equilibria, N, S, CCV, and C,

all respond similarly to a given parameter change. Exceptions arise with
respect to changes in the money demand parameters x,,

Welfare in the CCV

and S equilibria are independent of these parameters. On the other hand, in the
case of domestic demand or supply shocks, increases in these parameters have
qualitatively opposite effects on the Cournot and Stackelberg equilibria in the
foreign economy.

(ii) The qualitative effects of parameter changes are typically dependent

upon the sources of the disturbances. Consider, for example, an increase in the
degree of interdependence, as measured by an increase in d1. In the case of a
domestic demand shock, an increase in d1 reduces the welfare costs in both

countries. In the case of a domestic supply shock, an increase in d1 improves
domestic welfare, but lowers welfare abroad. In the case of a worldwide supply
disturbance, both economies are worse off with increased interdependence.
(iii) With just two exceptions, increases in the parameter values have

qualitatively the same welfare effects in the two economies, in the face of

domestic demand shocks.'7 In the case of domestic supply shocks, on the other

-31hand, the welfare effects on the two economies are generally opposite. However,
this is not so in the case of changes in y; an increase in the slope of the
supply curve is always welfare improving for both economies.

(iv) There are no entries for the qualitative effects of changes in the
relative weight a in the objective function on the strategic equilibria N, S,

CCV, and C. This is because the corresponding welfare cost functions are all
nonlinear functions of a, being zero at the end points a = 0, a = 1, when each
policy maker has only one objective, in which case, the strategic policy problem
degenerates.

10. CONCLUSIONS
Several general conclusions can be drawn from

the

analysis.

(i) Demand shocks are much less problematical than supply disturbances, from

the viewpoint of macro stabilization. In all cases, a country—specific demand
disturbance of a given magnitude gives rise to less aggregate welfare costs (as

measured by the sum

than does a supply disturbance of equal magnitude.

Moreover, worldwide demand shocks pose no problem whatsoever. Their effects can
be eliminated entirely, provided each country simply adjusts its respective
money supply so as to ensure that the interest rate in its economy rises sufficiently so as to exactly neutralize the effects of the shocks on aggregate

demand. Worldwide supply shocks, on the other hand, are mutually compounding
and their effects can never be eliminated.18
(ii) The superiority of the (Pareto optimal) Cooperative Equilibrium over
the various non—cooperative equilibria (as measured by the aggregate welfare
costs

is small. Indeed, if the relative price elasticity of demand

exceeds unity say, it is almost negligible. But even for smaller values of this
parameter it is never large. The reason for this is the old Mundell negative

—32—

transmission mechanism which operates under flexible exchange rates and perfect

capital mobility. Under these conditions, the effects of monetary policies on
output and CPI abroad, as measured by 2 and n2,

are

dominated by their effect

domestically, , n1, so that the interactions between the policy makers are
small.

(iii) The strategic equilibria all show substantial margins of superiority

over the traditional equilibria of fixed or flexible exchange rates. While
fixed rates may be superior for one country in specific situations (such as when
it faces foreign demand shocks), this is at the substantial cost of the other
country, so that aggregate welfare is low.
(iv) One

result

of interest is the fact that, despite its use of superior

knowledge, the CCV equilibrium may be dominated by the Cournot equilibrium from

a welfare viewpoint. In the present analysis, this occurs with domestic demand
shocks. The tendency for more contraction by the domestic economy and less
abroad leads to too much variation in the CPI and too little adjustment in Output, relative to the Cournot equilibrium.
In conclusion, we should note some of the limitations of the analysis and

some directions for future work. First, the analysis is based on two identical
economies and it would clearly be of interest to relax this assumption. More
importantly, the model is purely static, with the disturbances being transitory

white noise. Finally, it is clearly desirable to extend this type of analysis
to a dynamic framework. To analyze intertemporal strategic behavior involves
dynamic game theory. Some initial work along these lines has been undertaken
using somewhat different models by Miller and Salmon (1985), Oudiz and Sachs

(1985) and Currie and Levine (1985). In particular, an interesting issue is
whether or not the small gains from cooperation, obtained in this static
analysis, become larger over time.

Solutions for Output and CPI

Given the symmetry of the underlying economies, the solutions for output and
the CPI for the domestic and foreign economies in the Cournot, CCV, and Cooperative equilibria are symmetric; the domestic and foreign shocks are simply

reversed. Thus the solutions for only the domestic economy need be reported.

similar framework is employed in a recent paper by Canzoneri and Hender-

undertaken here.

See Bresnahan (1981) and Perry (1982) for applications of the consistent

conjectural variations equilibrium to oligopoly theory. A recent paper by
Brandsma and Hughes Hallett (1984) considers conjectural variations (which are

not necessarily consistent) in a dynamic policy game framework. Although some
game theorists view the consistent conjectural variations equilibrium with some
skepticism (see Friedman (1982, Chapter 5)), it appears to be gaining their
acceptance and interest (see Basar (1985)).

4The use of numerical simulations as a method of analyzing small macro
models has been employed by a number of authors recently. See, e.g., Carlozzi
and Taylor (1985), Taylor (1985), Oudiz and Sachs (1984) for policy simulations
in two country macro models.

5The assumption of perfectly symmetric economies, being made in this paper,

is made virtually uniformly throughout the two country policy coordination

literature. One

empirical

investigation of coordination which allows for

asymmetric economies has been undertaken by Hughes Hallett (1984).

6We maintain the usual assumption that residents of each country do not hold
the currency of the other country.

7For example, if a shift term, w say, is added to the demand for money, our
analysis remains unchanged by redefining M' = M — w.

81n fact we have carried out such simulations and the results are changed
little.

9'rhis characteristic of relatively weak impact of domestic monetary policy

on foreign activity (and vice versa) arises, and for precisely the same reason,
in the Carlozzi and Taylor (1985) paper.

10Since the model is statIc, henceforth we shall delte the time subscript t.

= 0 in (1) and

11To show this, first set

accordance with (6'). Next substitute (4) into (1), to yield
(l+d2/y)Y = d1Y* — d21 + d3(P*+E_P) + U +

d2v/y

Clearly, the effects of u and v on aggregate demand are neutralized if the
interest rate I is adjusted by

y

d2

Now substituting (4) into (2) gives

M =

(cz1

+

l/y)Y — a2I

—

V/y

The implied adjustment in the money stock, which holds demand and output
constant, is therefore

13The symmetry of the optimal policies is a consequence of not only the sym-

metry of the underlying model, but also the fact that each country is weighted

equally in the joint cost function. The case of equal weights is just a special
case of the more general Pareto criterion, the minimization of
0 <

< 1.

140ur flexible exchange rate regime may also be described as being one of
setting monetary targets.

15We have also considered another natural means of pegging the exchange
rate,

M = — —[82u+83v]; M* =
81

This

—

81

requires each country to accommodate only to its own

disturbances.

This

rule turns out to be inferior to (22).

16Miller and Salmon (1985) assume d3 to be 1, while Oudiz and Sachs take it

to be somewhat larger, around 1.5. As noted, Carlozzi and Taylor run into similar problems regarding small linkage effects and take d3 =

.1.

Currie and

Levine (1985) take a slightly larger value of .3.

17The exceptions are the effects of changes in the monetary parameters
a2 in the Stackelberg equilibrium.

18The difficulty for stabilizing for supply shocks is also emphasized by
Taylor (1984).
