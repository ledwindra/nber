Issues in National Savings Policy

ABSTRACT

This paper reviews a number of issues relating to the policy goal of
increasing national saving s.

The first

sect i on

considers the measurement

and definition of nati onal savings. Co mpari sons of current US savings
rates with those of other countries and with the past US experience are

presented. The sec ond sec tion consi ders possible avenues through which
public policy can i ncrease

nat i onal

savi n gs.

Whi le most discussion has

centered on the eff ects of changes i n the rate of return received by
savers, this is far from t he only ch annel through which policy can effect
savings.

I conclude that changes in publ ic savin gs or dissavinq through

budget surpluses or defici ts are the most potent and reliable policy tool
for altering the say ings r ate. The third secti on of the paper examines a
crucial savings poli cy question

The al location of resources between present and future consumption — or

savings —

s perhaps the most fundamental choice facing any economy. Just as

an econoe y faces a c hoice betw een guns and butter today, i t faces a choice
between c onsumpti on today and consumption in the future.

And the stakes

involved in this ch oice are ex tremely large. Most of nati onal wealth will
be spent on future as opposed to present consumption. The rate of savings

The protection of generations yet unborn is often held to be ore of the

most fun damental roles of government.

Public policy affect s the national

savings decision in man y ways: through direct public sa ving or dissaving,
through the effects of taxat ion on the rates of return available to private
savers, through the effects of financi al regulatipns on the public's ability

to dissa ye and borrow, and through the effects of socia 1 insurance programs
on incen tives to self—insure through p rivate savings — to name just a few of

the

most important examples.

In many areas of economic policy, it is

possible for the government to be neut ral, leaving the private economy to
determi n e the allocation of resources.

In the context of savings policy,

this is impossible Any set of tax an d spending rules must necessarily

influence the rate of savings.

There is no natural benchmark of

neutral i ty.

This paper surveys some of the issues that are critical in thinking

about national savings policy. A major theme of much of the analysis is the
importance of thinking not just about the level of national savings but also

its allocation. While increases in national savings and increases in
productive plant and equipment are often equated in popular discourse, there

is a substantial difference. National savings go to finance residential

PUBLIC POLICY AND NATIONAL SAVINGS

This section c onsi ders the efficacy of possible policy approaches to

increasing nati onal savings.

The problem of how to increase national

savings is very different from the problem of isolating the cause of our low
national savi ngs rate. Just as we do not reinf late the leaky part of flat

tires, there is no reason why the cause of low savings rates need be
associated wi th poli cies to increase savings. Moreover, many potential
determi nants of the savings rate such as the age structure of the population

and the rate of tech nical change are not readily alterable through public

policy. Nor is the problem one of merely finding the most potent policy
lever for inc reasi ng national savings. The theory of economic policy
suggests that policy targets should be assigned to instruments which can
influence them significantly, without incurring substantial collateral
costs.

It

would be inappropriate for example, to try to manipulate the savings

rate by ab olishing life insurance contracts because of the collateral costs
involved, even though the policy might be quite effective. So too, measures
such as th e issuance of savings bonds cannot play a major role, because

while they do not have large collateral costs, they do not have much effect
on savings either. The problem of savings policy is to find policy measures
which can be carried far enough to significantly increase national savings

without giving rise to significant costs.

?1ic iog

Piying

The most direct tool at the governments disposal for altering the

national savi ngs rate is changes in the level of public saving or dissaving.
As we saw in the previous section, public saving is one of the three
components of national saving.

Indeed,

if the deficit can be altered without col ate ral costs, and i ts effects on

national saving can be gauged accurat ely, the theory of econo mic policy as
described in Brainard (1967) or Theil

(19 71) suggests that it alone should

In standard Keynesi an macroeconomic models, there is a clear and direct

linkage between national savings and public savings. Consider for example a
personal tax increase which reduces the government budget deficit.

9

If

government spending is kept constant, public savi ngs is increased by the

revenue raised through the tax increase. Private savings is reduced only to
the extent that the reduction in disposable incoai e caused by the tax

increase reduces private savings. As long as the marginal propensity to
save of the household sector is low, this offsett ing effect is likely to be
very minor.

This view of the effects of budget defic its on nat ional savings has
been challenged in recent years by Robert Bar ro (1974) and a number of other

authors. Their argument runs as follows. In the long run, the present
value of the government's tax receipts must e qual the present value of its

expenditures. Increases in taxes today, with expenditures held constant,
entail reductions in taxes tomorrow. The present value of the taxes that will
be collected from consumers is unaffected by a tax change.

Thi s means that

their wealth is unchanged and therefore that they should not al tar

their consumption decisions. Hence a tax inc rease should have no effect on
national savings. The argument may be stat ed another way. On Barro's view,
which is often referred to as the Ricardian Equivalence view!
debt is not net wealth.

The value of the government bonds tha t consumers

hold is exactly offset by their knowledge of the tax liabiliti es that will
ultimately be borne to se rvice or pay off the nation al debt

Changes in

government debt, because they cannot affect consumer s weal th, cannot affect
their spending decisions, and so cannot have any imp act on the level of
national savings.

Thus the Ricardian e qui

argument suggest s that policies which

change public savings whi le h aving no effect on the level of public spending

can have no impact on the nat ional savings r ate. Th is arg ument lirni ts
severely the efficacy of defi cit policy as a tool of savin gs policy.

Is it

valid? This has been the subject of a raging controversy over the past

10

decade. Much of the debate has revolved around the commonplace observation
that consumers have finite lifetimes. Therefore, holds the keynesian
argument, some of the tax 1 iabilities engendered by the national debt will
be borne by future generations. Those alive at present will spend more
because t hey are w ealthier on account of the gov ernment bonds they hold.

Persons y et unborn can hardly save in anticipati on of their tax liabilities.
As a resu lt, incre ases in government debt increa se private consumption and
thereby r educe nat ional savings. Proponents of the Ricardian equivalence
view disp ute this analysis holding that those al ive today are likely to

adjust th ci

r

bequests to reflect any tax liabilities that are foisted on

their des cendants.

it seems

that the nature of b equest motives is really of fu ndamental

about 3Z years.

consider the eff ects of future tax policies when they determine their
consumpt ion deci sions.

Even when 4 uture tax changes have been legislated,

11

consumers appear not to be much affected. This is illustrated by recent

experience. In the summe of 1 981, a three year program of sub stanti al
reductions in income taxes was enacted.

If cons umers acted in a forward

looking way, one would hay e cx ected consumption to surge imme diately and

then not to change much at all when the tax cuts actually took place. This
is not what has occurred.

Per sonal consumption expenditures r ose at a 1.7

percent rate during 1981 when the tax cut was en acted, and at a 2.5 percent
rate in 1982 when it began to take effect, and at a 5.1 percen t rate in 1983

when it fully came on stre am

The savings rate was higher in 1981 before

the tax cuts than in 1922 or 1 923 after the tax cuts.

Simil ar patterns

may be observed in other cases where tax policies have been announced in
advance.

Recall that the Ricard Ian equivalen ce proposition that consumers

internalize not only announc ed tax change s but a1o the yet unannounced
changes that will ult i

be needed to balance the government budget.

On balance

it seems reasonable to conclude that in creases in curre nt taxes will have a

hny offset due to

reduced private savings because of reduced future tax 1 iabilities seems
likely to be small.

The analysis here has concentrated on the effects of changes in taxes

which leave government spending unaffected. Quite obviously, even on the
Ricardian equivalence view, changes in government spending might affect

years, mary public finance experts have advocated that our

current income tax system be replaced with a consumption tax. One of the
arguments advanced in favor of a consumpti on tax is that it wou Id p romote

that the tax system should be reformed to promote s aving at the exp ense of

various positions about the degree to which capital is interciatior.ally

deficit, and the substantial internatior.al flows of gross investment bely

the view that capital is inherently immobile.
On the other hand, as Feldstein and Horioka (199Q have emphasized the

correlation across countries between rates of savings and investment is

extremely high. High savings countries are also high investment countries
on a very consistent basis. This proposition is illustrated in Table 3
which presents national savings and investment rates for a number of
countries.

While the 1 ong run average savings rate varied across countries

between 17.3 percent and 34.9 percent, the largest average :urrent account
deficit was only 4.4 percent and the largest surplus was only 1.7 percent.
The correlation between domesti: savings and investment rates was .91. For
various sample periods, regressions consistently suggest that the propensity

to invest out of domesti c savings exceed; .9. domestic nvestmert rates or,
domestic savings rates consistently suggests that the propensity t o invest
out of domestic savings exceeds .9.
It is not clear how the observed high correlation of dowestic savings
and investment rate; can be reconciled with high degree of :apitai mctiiity

that seems apparent. Su rely, it is unlikely that coincidence leads to the
strong association of savings and investnr.t rates.

In Sumiers (1595;, I

argue that the observed association between savings and investment rates is
a reflection of national economic policies.

For reasons that are not

entirely clear, nations are unwill irig to accept large current e:count
imbalances for sustained periods.

This leads them to use the ieers of

economic policy to achieve extern;l balance. This iCCi

For example, it

appears that within the OECD, nations where private savings exceeds domestic
investment tend to run budget deficits on average, while na tions where
private savings fal is short of investment tend to run surpiuses on average.
This interpret ation of the data suggests that nations are unlikely to
pursue policies whi ch substantially increase national savings without also
attempt ing to stimulate national investment. However, it suggests that if
such a policy were attempted, the result would be only smal 1 increases in
capital formation, and a large effect on the trade balance

In a sense, the

United States has pursued this policy in reverse in recent years, as the
Federal budget deficit has mushroomed. The result has been large capital

inflows from abroad which have enabled domestic investment to be extremely

strong on a cyclically adjusted basis.
If

capi tal

the primary effect of increases in nation'al savings is to reduce

inflows or increase capital outflows with r elati vel y little impact

on nati onal investment, the question arises of whe ther or n ot they are
desirab le. This depends on why they are being adv ocated.

Investment abroad

will no t increase the productivity of American wor kers. No r does the tax
system create a wedge between the private and Amer ican soci al return to

foreign mv estment.

On the ot her hand, increased foreign i nvestment does

pass wealth on to future gener ati ons an d in this sense may be beneficial.

Furthermore increased capital out flows or reduced capital i nflows will be

associated with improvements in the competitiveness of domestic firms on
world markets.

Finally, the estimates suggest that each dollar of Federal deficits
crowds out about 40 cents of net invest ment. Th e average estimate in the
table is somewhat greater than this but negl ects the effects of deficits on
foreign capital inflows which have only become I mportant in the last decade.
The estimates in the final row of the table mdi cate that a little less than
half of the crowded out investment is p lant and equipment with the remainder
being inventories and housing.

An extr a dollar of Federal saving, according

to these estimates, will only generate about 20 cents in extra plant and
equipment investment.

omitted. An alternative approach to estimating the effect of changes in
Federal saving on the composition of national output is through simulation

of a large econometric model. To this end, Table 5 reports the results of
some recent DRI simulations of the effects of a deficit reform package.

The

deficit reform package which DRI considered reduced the Federal deficit as a
share of BNP by 3.5 percent over the 1986—1989 period through a balanced

combination of tax increases and spending cuts. DRI also estimated the
effects of its package on the components of SNP.
The results in Table 5 tend to corroborate the estimates just

presented. About one—third of the effects of deficit reduction is offset by
decreases in private saving. A little less than a third is offset by
increased state and local surpluses and reduced net foreign investment.
Just over a third of deficit reductions flow into increased net investment,
with about two—thirds of this total devoted to residential investment.

means that each dcllar of deficit reduction leads to about a fifteen cent

increase in net plant and equipment investment. It is encouraging that
these large econometric model estimate; are so close to those obtained from

reduced forms. While each methodology has its problems for an exercise of
this sort, the error; should be relatively independent.
On balance, these empirical Exercises confirm the hypotheses sketched

at the beginning of this section. In:reases in national saving are likely
to have a variety of effects. In part, exogenous increases will be offset
by the effects of lower interest rates, in part net foreign investment will

decline, and residential and nonresidential investment will increase. As a
very rough approximation, these four responses will occur to about an equal

extent. The conclusion is that increases in national saving are a relatively
ineffective way of stimulating business investment. This conclusion would be
reinforced if Keynesian effects of increased saving! on aggregate demand
were considered, or if more weight were given to the current episode of
strong investment performance in the face of large budget deficits.

One plausible

measure of the certainty e quivalent re turn on extra savi ngs is the real
return on nearly risk free investments such as Treasury bills. While this
figure is perhaps 5 percent at present

it has averaged less than 1 percent

over the past 40 years.

On balance, it seems likely that the current risk adjusted social
return to increased savings is probably well below 9 percent, and perhaps is
less than the economy's growth rate.

At such rates, it is not clear that the social gains from increased

national savings would be large. There does not seems to be a
compelling case for raising investment in houses or the value 0+ land.

Nor,

except for current exigencies is there a clear case for reducing net foreign

investment in the United States. While there are strong economic arguaents

for increased investment in plant and equipment

increasing national savings

is a very indirect way to br ing it about.
The arguments presented in Section 3 about the allocation of

incremental savings suggest the desirability of policies directed
specifically at stimulati ng d omesti c plant and equipment investment. All
the analysis im plies that the supply of saving s to the corporate sector is
very elastic.

Even if sa vings do not respond sharply to increases in the

rate of return, there is subst antial scope for portfolio reallocations to

finance increas es in bus i

ness

i nvestm ent. Hence

measures which stimulate

investment are unlikely to be crowded out by ri sing interest rates. The
returns to priv ate inve stment in plan t and equi pment exceed those on other

investment. And there is at least some reason to think that there may be
substantial tech nological cx ternal ities associated with plant and equipment
investment
