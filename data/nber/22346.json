    "abstract": "\n\nThe invention of new applications based on information and communications technologies (ICTs) has had two economic effects up to now.  These applications have transformed production, creating value for applications-inventing companies and their customers and increasing economic growth through quality improvements.  The same applications have shifted the relative demand for different kinds of labor, raising the demand for already highly-compensated managers and professionals relative to other workers.  This paper considers the likely impact of new ICT technologies coming into application in the workplace today in light of the economic and technical forces behind ICT application up to now.\n\n",
