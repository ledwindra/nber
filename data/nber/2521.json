    "abstract": "\n\nThe paper explores how a tariff may affect saving through intergenerational redistribution of income that is caused by changes in factor prices and by the distribution of tariff revenue. The model is a Blanchard-type overlapping generations model. Two types of revenue distribution schemes are examined ? lump-sum distribution of current revenues to currently living individuals, and distribution as a subsidy to holders of physical wealth. (There is no fiscal policy in this paper -- the government budget is continuously balanced). We draw some general conclusions about the non-neutralities that arise in this type of model as opposed to single-generation models, or models in which perfect bequest motives exist.\n\n",
