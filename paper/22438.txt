ABSTRACT
This paper evaluates the extent of heterogeneity in time discounting among elderly Americans, as
well as its role in explaining older peoples’ key behaviors. We first show how older Americans
evaluate simple (hypothetical) intertemporal choices in which payments now are compared with
payments in the future. This adds to the literature on time horizon experiments by focusing on a
nationally representative sample of persons age 70+. Using the indicators derived from this
experiment, we show how differences in discounting patterns are associated with characteristics
of particular importance in elderly populations, such as serious health and mental conditions. We
then relate our discounting measure to key outcome variables including wealth, the timing of
retirement, investments in health, and decisions about end of life care.

Time Discounting and Economic Decision-making
Among the Elderly
David Huffman, Raimond Maurer, and Olivia S. Mitchell

Many economic and psychological studies have sought to explore how people make intertemporal decisions, but most previous research on impatience and its impact on economic and
other outcomes has focused mainly on younger individuals (c.f., Burks et al. 2009; Chabris et al.
2008; Schreiber and Weber 2015; Sutter et al. 2013). Yet understanding how older individuals
make decisions with intertemporal dimensions is of importance, inasmuch this is when many
people make critically consequential financial decisions that affect the remainder of their lives.
Examples include how much to save and spend, when to work versus claim Social Security benefits,
whether and how much to invest in health and health insurance, whether to sell one’s home and
move, and many other factors central to retirement well-being.
There is also little known about the extent of heterogeneity in discount rates amount the
elderly, and how such diversity might relate to personal characteristics. If time discounting varies
systematically with demographic or cultural characteristics, this could have important implications
for how economic outcomes vary for the elderly within society. Moreover, discounting could
potentially change in old age, something that can only be studied in with data on elderly individuals.
Aging involves reduced life expectancy, and lower probability of survival could potentially affect
discounting of the future. Empirical evidence on whether and how life expectancy affects
discounting, however, is scarce. 1 Some aspects of cognitive functioning also become increasingly

One exception is Oster et al. (2013), who show that individuals who are diagnosed with Huntington’s disease at an
early age make decisions consistent with greater discounting of the future. Sunde and Dohmen (forthcoming) have a
nice recent review of preferences and aging, but they focus mainly on risk attitudes and not time preferences as we
do here.

difficult at older ages, in the form of dementia, but little is known about how this might affect
intertemporal decision-making. For all of these reasons, it is of interest to delve into questions
about the determinants of time discounting among the older population.
In this paper we present and analyze time discounting metrics measured in a representative
sample of individuals age 70+. To this end, we use a purpose-built survey module we devised for
the 2014 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to examine the levels of and heterogeneity in time
discounting among the elderly, and we study how this heterogeneity varies with personal
characteristics. Moreover, we leverage the rich information about retirement, wealth accumulation,
and health behaviors reported in the HRS to evaluate how and whether such heterogeneity helps
explain differences in important economic behaviors across older individuals.
To preview results on heterogeneity and determinants, we show that the mean (median)
value of the implied Internal Rate of Return (IRR) used by our older population to discount future
payments is 0.54 (0.58), with a standard deviation of 0.35. 2 Our IRR measures rise with age: thus
a 15-year increase in age from 70 to 85 would be associated with about a standard deviation higher
IRR. This result is robust to a variety of controls. We also show that Whites and the better-educated
have lower IRRs. Serious health conditions, which imply reduced life expectancy, are associated
with 11-30 percent higher IRRs. Cognition scores are not statistically associated with our
impatience measures, controlling for education. An indicator for dementia, however, is associated
with significantly higher IRRs.
When we relate our impatience measures to outcomes of interest using multiple regression
models, several interesting results emerge. Net wealth is significantly lower for the least patient,
probably indicating that the least patient save less and therefore arrive at old age with fewer assets.
The IRR is the interest rate which sets equal the net present value of the future money amount and the money
amount offered today.

We also find that the impatient are much less likely to engage in healthy behaviors and to have
made provision for end of life challenges. And finally, our analysis shows that Social Security
claiming ages are not significantly related to the IRRs. We check robustness of the results to using
an Impatience Index, which combines the IRR measure with a more subjective measure of
impatience, and reach similar conclusions.
The next section offers a brief literature review. Next we outline our methodology, and the
subsequent section provides descriptive statistics regarding the mean and dispersion of discounting
among the elderly. In a final analytic section we review the association between several economic
and health outcomes, and the measured discount rates we derive. A final section concludes.

Background
Economic theory holds that time discounting plays a crucial role in decision-making about
inter-temporal tradeoffs. Thus over the life cycle, people must decide to consume less than their
incomes when young and save and accumulate retirement assets, which they can then draw down
to support old-age consumption. Nevertheless, everyone is not homogeneous. That is, those who
discount the future more will place a higher value on current versus future consumption, which in
turn will prompt them to save less and possibly run out of money in old age. Similarly, someone
who discounts the future very heavily might claim Social Security benefits earlier, thus committing
himself to lower old-age payments the rest of his life. And people who downweight the future can
also make decisions about their own health, insurance, and other financial products, that may
expose them to greater risks in old age.
Accordingly, we seek to determine the extent of time discounting among the elderly.
Additionally we investigate whether such preferences can help explain heterogeneity in a wide

5

range of decisions, including how long to work, whether to invest in one’s own health, whether to
purchase long-term care or life insurance, and what provisions to make regarding the end of one’s
life. Extreme levels of impatience may also be an indicator of self-control problems, in the sense
of present-biased preferences (Rabin, 2002), so these might help predict preference reversals, for
example individuals stopping work earlier than they had previously planned.
The present research therefore provides evidence on time discounting patterns among
Americans age 70+. With our survey, we also examine the cross-sectional association between
time discounting and respondent characteristics, to explore population heterogeneity in impatience.
To the extent that time individuals’ attitudes toward time discounting are quite persistent over time,
the measures of discounting that we elicit among older respondents may also be useful for
explaining decisions made earlier in life. These include, for example, saving decisions resulting in
more or less wealth in retirement. 3

Methods
We have designed and implemented a survey module in the 2014 HRS to elicit time
discounting among older adults. Specifically, we gave respondents over the age of 70 who were
randomly selected to respond to this module a list of money choices where they considered
receiving different payments at different points in time. The decision in the inter-temporal choice
exercise was between “$100 today" and some larger amount $Y that would be received 12 months
in the future (see Online Appendix A for the precise wording of the module).
Everyone taking the survey module first received a choice between a hypothetical payment
of $100 today versus a delayed payment of $154 twelve months from today. If the respondent

years, but Dohmen et al. (2010) report some fluidity over the life cycle.

responded that he preferred the later payment, he was shown a smaller delayed amount. If, however,
the respondent favored the early payment, he was shown a larger delayed amount. Several such
choices were provided until each respondent had indicated the value of Y (or equivalently, the
implied annual rate of return) to which he was indifferent, when comparing receiving $100 now
versus waiting 12 months. In this way, we obtained an indicator of each respondent’s implied
internal rate of return. 4
Our values in the choice exercise were chosen to match the magnitudes of rewards used in
typical intertemporal choice experiments which are the gold standard for measuring time
discounting. 5 Falk et al. (2014) showed that the survey measure we use is a strong and significant
predictor of time discounting in such choice experiments. 6 Furthermore, Falk et al. (2015) found
that the survey discounting measure they used predicted important outcomes such as savings and
human capital accumulation in young population samples around the world. That evidence
provides confidence that our survey measure does capture a trait that determines behavior under
real stakes, despite the hypothetical payments and particular parameter values. 7
Our HRS survey module also asked each respondent questions about his self-reported
Future Oriented Score. This survey measure was also found by Falk et al. (2015) to correlate with
behavior in incentivized intertemporal choice experiments, and add explanatory power when
combined with the choice exercise into a single impatience index. Accordingly, we check

See Online Appendix B for detail on the computation method.
See Harrison et al. (2002) for a seminal paper on using choice experiments to measure individual discount rates in a
representative sample. The experiments measure time discounting under a set of assumptions. One key assumption
required for the experiments to provide an index of impatience is that individuals treat the monetary rewards like
consumption opportunities.
6
Falk et al. (2014) had subjects participate in incentivized intertemporal choice experiments and also answer a battery
of different survey questions about time discounting. The survey measure we use is based on one of the best predictors
of choices in those incentivized experiments (a measure that is part of the Falk et al. Preference Survey Module).
7
While the magnitudes of monetary payments used in the measure are small relative to typical lifetime income, it is
well documented that individuals exhibit considerable heterogeneity in their preferences about timing of such rewards,
and this heterogeneity is correlated with large-stakes intertemporal choices (Falk et al. 2015).

robustness of results to using such an impatience index. The survey also included a question aimed
specifically at capturing present-bias and dynamically inconsistent preferences, which asked about
postponing. The latter measure provides a Procrastinator Score for each respondent. 8
To the database of survey module responses, we appended information on several
important socio-economic and demographic variables from the HRS Core dataset. 9 These included
age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, religion, and an indicator of whether the
respondent was relatively optimistic about his subjective life expectancy (compared to the relevant
actuarial age/sex life table). The respondent’s cognitive score was also included as a control,
following Dohmen et al. (2010, 2012) who found a positive correlation between impatience and
cognition for a younger population. In addition we control for variables indicating that the
respondent had been told by a doctor that he had cancer, lung disease, a heart condition, a stroke,
or had been diagnosed with Alzheimers or dementia. In some models we also control on (ln)
household income. 10
In what follows, we first offer some descriptive statistics on the time discounting measures
derived using the answers our older respondents provided to the HRS module questions. Next, we
link the IRR measures to key outcome variables of interest in the HRS. For instance, we evaluate
whether people who were more impatient by our measure ended up with less wealth in retirement,

The Future Oriented Score is measured by the respondent’s answer to the following question: How do you see
yourself: are you a person who is generally willing to give up something today in order to benefit from that in the
future, or are you not willing to do so? Please use a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means you are “completely unwilling
to give up something today" and a 10 means you are “very willing to give up something today". Use the values inbetween to indicate where you fall on the scale. The Procrastinator Score is measured by the respondent’s answer to
this question: How well does the following statement describe you as a person? I tend to postpone things even though
it would be better to get them done right away. Use a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means “does not describe me at all"
and a 10 means “describes me perfectly". Use the values in-between to indicate where you fall on the scale.

Most variables were taken from the RAND HRS datafile, though in a few cases we used the 2014 HRS wave which
had not yet been integrated into the RAND file.

invested less in their own health via various preventive health behaviors, and were less likely to
defer retirement.

Time Discounting Among the Elderly: Results
Figure 1 reports the distribution of measured discount rates, or internal rates of return (IRR),
derived from the respondents’ answers to the questions described above. The mean (median) value
of the IRR for our older population is 0.54 (0.58), with a minimum of 0.03, a maximum of 0.93,
and a standard deviation of 0.35. 11
Previous studies have used samples that include younger individuals, and have typically
found average discount rates that are somewhat lower that we observe for the elderly. For example,
using a similar methodology to ours, involving choices between early and delayed monetary
payments, Goda et al. (2015) found an average discount rate of 0.29 for the Rand American Life
Panel and the Understanding America Study, both datasets that are intended to be representative
of US adults. Harrison et al. (2002) find an average discount rate of 0.28 in a representative sample
of the Danish adult population, and Dohmen et al. (2012) reported an average discount rate in the
range of 0.28 to 0.30 for a representative sample of German adults. Warner and Pleeter (2001)
used a different methodology, involving much larger financial stakes than the typical experimental
study: They estimated discount rates from the choices of members of the US army, between
alternative pension schemes. They found a discount rate in the range of 0.10 to 0.19 for officers,
and 0.33 to 0.50 for enlisted soldiers, more or less in line with the previously mentioned
experimental studies. Previous studies have also found indications that IRRs increase over the life
cycle (see Dohmen et al., 2012, and forthcoming), helping reconcile the higher discount rates that

we observe among the elderly. An interesting open question is what might cause changing discount
rates over the life cycle, something we turn to in later analysis.
Notably, essentially all previous studies that estimate individual discount rates using
experiments or intertemporal choices in other settings have reported estimated discount rates that
were substantially higher than market interest rates. Such results contrast with the prediction of
many economic models that people save only to earn interest, and market interest rates adjust
towards rates of time preference. While the subject remains an area of debate, there are some
reasonable explanations for the discrepancy. One could be a systematic tendency to overestimate
time preference rates, although it is hard to explain the similarity of results across different
methodologies. Another is that the motives behind purchases of financial assets, and the
mechanisms determining interest rates, are not fully understood, particularly when time
preferences are heterogeneous and correlated with other preferences and characteristics.
Figure 1 here
In Table 1 we report linear regressions of time discounting on personal characteristics. IRR
is used in the first three columns, where we see a positive and statistically significant effect of age,
on the order of about 1 point. Compared to the IRR mean of 54 points, this is about a two
percentage point effect. While it is not enormous, it is economically meaningful, and it suggests
that rates of impatience rise with age. Interpreted literally, a 15-year increase in age (say from 70
to 85) would raise the IRR by about a standard deviation. The magnitude is also quite robust to the
inclusion of other controls including sex, race/ethnicity, education, religion, optimism about
longevity, health indicators, and income.
Table 1 here

10

Results also show that Whites have systematically lower IRRs than nonwhites, by about 9
points (11 percent); there is no statistically significant differential effect for Hispanics, ceteris
paribus. The more educated also have lower rates of impatience, such that one additional year of
education is associated with a lower IRR of about one point (2 percentage points) – or roughly the
same as a year of age. Interestingly, scoring higher on the cognitive ability 12 measure had no
impact on measured IRRs, controlling for education. 13 Including household income does not
change results, in contrast to Carvalho et al. (2016) who focus on the poor and conclude that those
who are cash-constrained are more present-biased.
Adding controls for self-reported health problems, some of them severe enough to imply
reduced life expectancy, boosts the explained variance (R-squared) by about half, and these
additional variables prove to be statistically significant as well. For instance those who had been
told they had cancer or a heart condition had 6-8 points higher IRRs, or 11-15 percent higher.
Economic theory predicts that reduced life expectancy should increase discounting of the future,
but empirical evidence has been scarce. One exception is Oster et al. (2013), who study individuals
diagnosed with Huntington’s disease at an early age; learning about the disease is associated with
changes in behavior such as choosing to retire earlier, which could reflect greater discounting of
the future. Our sample of the elderly provides another opportunity to shed light on this question,
but with direct measures of time discounting, and provides converging evidence with Oster et al.
(2013).
We also find that IRRs are higher for individuals diagnosed with a mental condition
(dementia or Alzheimers): IRRs are 19 points (35 percent) higher than average. The mechanism

The measurement of cognition in the HRS is detailed in Fisher et al. (2015).
A number of other studies have studied how cognitive ability affects impatience including Benjamin et al. (2013)
and Dohmen et al. (2010), though not for the older population as here.

could potentially be reduced life expectancy, or it could reflect a systematic impact of dementia
on decision-making. If dementia leads to more impatient choices, this has important implications
for the outcomes of the elderly who are affected by this condition.
The second three columns of Table 1 use the Impatience Index as the dependent variable,
which is the normalized sum the IRR and the negative of the self-reported Future Oriented Score.
The results are broadly similar to those based on using the IRR measure alone, in that ethnicity,
education, mental acuity, and health conditions are all related to impatience in the same directions.
There are some differences, for example in that cognitive ability is significantly related to the
Impatience Index, while mental shortfall is not, the opposite of the findings for IRR. Also, having
a heart condition is not significantly related to the Impatience Index.

Associations between Time Discounting and Key Economic Behaviors
Tables 2 through 5 show how our IRR and Impatience Index measures are associated with
key outcomes of interest. These include respondents’ net wealth, a Healthy Behaviors Index,14
how well prepared people are for end of life contingencies, and retirement behaviors. For each
outcome, we first regress it on the IRR (or the Impatience Index), and then we add the sociodemographic controls used above (age, sex, race/ethnicity, years of education, marital status,
cognition score, religion, procrastinator score, and health controls). A final model in each case also
included (ln) household income to evaluate whether the impatience variables are sensitive to its
inclusion.
Tables 2-5 here

This is measured as the number of precautionary health practices undertaken by the respondent such as getting a flu
shot, not smoking, not drinking to excess, and having the relevant gender-appropriate annual exams (e.g., prostate
exams, Pap and mammograms).
14

12

Net Wealth. The first four columns of Table 2 show that, whether we hold other factors constant
or not, there is a strong, statistically significant, and powerful relationship between respondents’
impatience measures and their net wealth (the latter is measured in thousands). Specifically, those
with higher IRRs have lower wealth, and the coefficient magnitudes are large across all four
columns. Focusing on the columns including controls, an IRR coefficient of around -375 suggests
that someone with an IRR one standard deviation above the mean would have 29 percent less
wealth than his counterpart at the mean (=0.35*375/442). Goda et al. (2013) found a large and
significant correlation between time discounting and retirement wealth, for younger age groups,
and Hurd and Rohwedder (2013) reported lower wealth for those indicating they had a short
planning horizon. Our results are also consistent with the idea that discount rates measured in old
age are relevant for explaining variation in retirement wealth.
Smaller but significant negative coefficients are found for the Procrastinator score, while
most health effects are not statistically significant. Interestingly, the education effect is positive
and significant when household income is excluded. The White coefficient is also positive and
consistently significant, suggesting that this group has more net wealth in older years even after
conditioning on other controls. Moreover, estimated magnitudes are comparable to the IRR effect:
that is, being White versus nonwhite is associated with having 32-48 percent more net wealth
($145-210/ 442). Overall, the models account for between 16-20 percent of variation in the IRR
variable.
On the right hand side of Table 2 we run similar regressions, but this time focus on the
Impatience Index. The findings are very similar to those using the IRR. Individuals who are more
impatience according to the index have significantly lower wealth.

13

Health. We next turn to an examination of how the Healthy Behaviors Index varies according to
the IRR and other factors. The first three columns of Table 3 include the IRR as the key variable
of interest, and longer set of controls first excludes, and then includes, the (ln) of household income,
to investigate coefficient sensitivity. Results show that people having higher IRRs are less likely
to engage in healthy behaviors, and the effects are statistically significant. Quantitatively, they are
on the small side: for instance, an individual with a standard deviation higher IRR would have
about 0.1 or two percent more healthy behaviors than average (=0.27*0.35/3.3). 15 Chabris et al.
(2008) document a relationship between IRRs and health behaviors for several samples of
individuals with different age ranges, all much younger than our sample. Sutter et al. (2010) show
similar results for high school age students. Our results show that IRRs also matter for health
behaviors towards the end of life. We find that age also has a positive and significant coefficient
in the regression explaining health behaviors, though the magnitude is again small. People with
higher cognition scores also have more healthy behaviors as measured by our Index.
The next three columns substitute the Impatience Index for the IRR. As shown in column
4, individuals who are more impatient according to the index have significantly lower scores on
the health index, similar to conclusions based on the IRR measure. The relationships are less
precisely estimated and lose statistical significance, however, after controls are added to the
regression in columns 5 and 6.
End of Life Provision. We are also interested in whether impatient people are also less likely to
put into place appropriate precautions around their end of life challenges. Understanding decisions
about end of life care is important, given the large component of end of life care to health care

Our findings suggest that, while impatience is relevant for explaining heterogeneity in health behaviors, the
contribution is modest in size. This could explain why incentives for health behaviors designed to counteract
impatience by making present benefits larger do not have particularly long-lasting effects; see McConnell (2016).
15

14

costs in the United States (see De Nardi et al. 2010). We provide some first evidence on whether
variation in time discounting is relevant for such decisions, or whether they are mainly driven by
other factors. Our End of Life Index is a count of the number of affirmative responses each
respondent gave to questions about whether he had long-term care insurance, assigned a power of
attorney, a living will, and had discussed end of life medical care plans with others. The mean
(median) value of this index is 1.7 (2), with a standard deviation of 1.3.
Table 4 shows the results from our descriptive regressions. Our sample size is somewhat
attenuated since almost six percent of the sample did not respond to all the questions comprising
the End of Life Index.

The first column confirms a negative and statistically significant

relationship of the IRR with the index, so it impatience is inversely related to taking health
precautions around the end of life. Nevertheless the coefficient is attenuated and significance falls
with the inclusion of other controls. Other significant relationships include the positive and
significant effect of age, where 15 additional years of age would be associated with half a point
increase in the End of Life score, or an improvement of 27% (from the mean of 1.7). Whites also
score about 0.5-0.6 points higher than nonwhites (36 percent), while Hispanics score 0.7 points
(42 percent) lower than non-Hispanics, and both effects are strongly significant. The only other
factor which is notably negative associated with making End of Life provisions is being married,
such that married individuals score 0.3 points (or 17 percent) below their single counterparts.
The next three columns substitute the Impatience Index for the IRR. In this case, the
relationship between impatience and the end of life index remains statistically significant even
with all controls in the regression. Overall, the findings indicate that variation in time discounting
in old age is related to decisions about end of life care

15

Retirement Behavior. Next we turn to an examination of how retirement patterns vary across
more, versus less, patient HRS respondents. Two outcomes are of interest in Table 5: Panel A
investigates the age at which people initiated their Social Security benefits, or what is often termed
the Social Security claiming age, while Panel B focuses on the difference between peoples’ actual
Social Security claiming age and their expected claiming age. 16 As before, the first of four models
in each case includes only the impatience factor, and then we add additional controls culminating
with the inclusion of (ln) household income. The goal once again is to evaluate the robustness of
the results across models.
The analysis in Panel A suggests that only age and education are positively and
significantly associated with the respondent’ Social Security claiming age. Of the medical
conditions, only having had a stroke is linked to lower claiming ages. The IRR measure, and the
Impatience Index, are both associated with earlier claiming ages, as would be expected if more
impatient people place less weight on earning money for future, post-retirement consumption, but
these relationships are not statistically significant.
Results in Panel B show that the IRR and Impatience Index are negatively associated with
the difference between actual and expected claiming ages. Though the coefficients are not
statistically significant in our sample, the most impatient people claimed earlier than expected,
which is consistent with the preference reversal behavior of Rabin (2002), mentioned above.
Beyond age, little else is associated with this difference other than being Jewish (negative and
significant) and having been diagnosed with mental problems (also negative and significant).
Our findings regarding retirement outcomes contrast to some extent with evidence from
Schreiber and Weber (2016). They conducted an online survey with roughly 3,000 German
The respondent’s expected claiming age is taken from the earliest reported HRS wave. Both analyses include only
the subset of HRS respondents with nonmissing and nonzero actual and expected claiming ages.

newspaper readers, and find that a measure of present bias is associated with earlier retirement
ages, and a greater discrepancy between planned and actual retirement age, in the direction of
retiring earlier than expected. One possible explanation for the difference is that they used a
measure of present bias that has a different format from ours. Another possible explanation is that
they used self-reported retirement age, such that respondents offered their own subjective
definition of what it means to be retired. Our approach uses a more objective, although not
necessarily better, approach to measuring retirement, namely social security claiming age.

Conclusions and Policy Implications
Recent policy discussions have focused on what interventions might be designed to address
low savings rates (Ashraf et al. 2006), over-consumption of harmful goods such as smoking and
drinking (Camerer et al. 2003), avoid poverty (Carvalho et al. 2016), increase financial literacy
(Lusardi and Mitchell 2007), and avoid making financial mistakes over the life cycle (Agarwal et
al. 2009). Likewise there is substantial interest in finding ways to encourage people to delay
retirement and thereby enjoy greater Social Security benefits in old age (Alleva 2016; Maurer et
al. forthcoming). Yet few studies have focused on older adults, impatience, and interesting wealth,
health, and retirement behaviors. Accordingly, we fill this gap by exploring the extent of and
factors associated with impatience in the older population.
Using a purpose-built module in the HRS, we use experimental elicitations of time
preferences for money to show that the mean (median) value of the IRR for our older population
is 0.54 (0.58), with a standard deviation of 0.35. These values are reasonable and confirm to an
all-age survey conducted in Germany. Our IRR measures rise with age: thus a 15-year increase in
age from 70 to 85 would be associated with about a standard deviation higher IRR. This result is

17

robust to a variety of controls. We also show that Whites and the better educated have lower IRRs,
while those with health conditions have 11-30 percent higher IRRs. Cognition scores are not
statistically associated with our impatience measures.
When we relate our impatience measures to outcomes of interest using multiple regression
models, several interesting results emerge. Net wealth is significantly lower for the least patient,
probably indicating that the least patient save less and therefore arrive at old age with fewer assets.
We also find that the impatient are much less likely to engage in healthy behaviors and to have
made provision for end of life challenges. And finally, our analysis shows that Social Security
claiming ages are not significantly related to the IRRs, though impatience is associated with people
claiming benefits earlier than anticipated.
Our findings add to the literature on discounting behavior as well as to the understanding
of older persons’ decision processes. They also have implications for policy. For instance, the
existence of widespread impatience among older Americans suggests that people may be willing
to take less than actuarially fair incentives in exchange for working longer, particularly if they
have access to lump sums. Increasing immediate rewards to other behaviors could also encourage
choices such as investing in one’s health and making end of life decisions in advance of need.
Future work can work can pursue some intriguing questions raised by our findings, about
the determinants of time discounting. Once concerns the explanation for an age effect on IRRs.
Since almost all data sets measuring IRRs are cross sectional, it has not been possible to
disentangle cohort effects from effects of the aging process. Finding that IRRs vary with age in
the relatively narrow age band of our sample casts some doubt on the cohort explanation, although
the evidence is clearly not definitive. If it is the process of aging that affects IRRs, what is the
specific mechanism? One possible mechanism is reduced survival probability, in line with the

18

finding that diagnosis of serious health conditions is also associated with higher IRRs. The
relationship between mental shortfall and IRRs also hints at a possible, unanticipated consequences
of Alzheimers and related conditions, in terms of systematic changes in decision-making,
something that calls for further study.

Online Appendix B. Generating Patience Scores and Internal Rates of Return Measures
from Our Survey Module
This document explains how we calculate Patience Scores and Internal Rates of Return (IRR) for
all respondents in our data, using responses to the HRS module described above.
1. Patience Scores
Respondents’ patience scores were elicited using the Survey Module (see Appendix A) and
coding responses as follows, depending on the skip logic each person’s answers traced.

2. How We Computed the IRRs
The annual Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is the annual interest rate that makes it equally attractive
to receive $100 now, or a larger amount $X in 12 months. If the interest rate is compounded once
per year, the IRR satisfies this equation:
(1+IRR)*$100 = $X
We can solve for the IRR as:
IRR = ($X/$100) - 1
With compounding twice per year, the annual IRR satisfies:
(1+IRR/2)^2*$100 = $X
IRR =2*[ [($X/$100) ^(.5)]- 1 ]
With continuous compounding, the annual IRR satisfies:
(e^IRR)*$100 = $X
IRR = ln([($X/$100)

38

3. Inferring Respondents’ IRRs from Responses to Time Preference Questions:
A respondent’s choices in the time preference questions reveal something about the size of delayed
payment $Z, received in 12 months that would make him willing to give up $100 received now.
We cannot infer his exact $Z, but we infer lower and upper bounds for his true $Z. This in turn
allows us to infer bounds for an individual’s IRR, i.e., the annual interest rate that solves
(1+IRR)*$100 = $Z for that person. The patience score derived from the survey is given as follows:

$112 >= $Z >= $109
$109 >= $Z >= $106
$106 >= $Z >= $103
$103 >= $Z >= $0

For example, suppose someone has a patience score of 25. In this case we know:
$125 >= $Z >= $122. Thus, $Z is at least $122 and at most $125.
If we compounding occurred once per year, this means the person’s lower bound IRR is:
IRRlower = ($122/$100) – 1 = 0.22. And the upper bound IRR is: IRRupper = ($125/$100) – 1 =
0.25. We take the midpoint to be the respondent’s IRR: IRR = (.22 + .25)/2 = 0.235. In the case
of patience score of 1, we only have the lower bound, so we just use the lower bound.
