    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper develops tools and techniques to study the impact of exogenous changes in factor supply and factor demand on factor allocation and factor prices in economies with a large number of goods and factors. The main results of our paper characterize sufficient conditions for robust monotone comparative statics predictions in a Roy-like assignment model. These general results are then used to generate new insights about the consequences of globalization.\n\n",
