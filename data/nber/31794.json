    "abstract": "\n\nWe argue that the Democratic Party\u2019s evolution on economic policy helps explain partisan realignment by education. We show that less-educated Americans differentially demand \u201cpredistribution\u201d policies (e.g., a federal jobs guarantee, higher minimum wages, protectionism, and stronger unions), while more-educated Americans differentially favor redistribution (taxes and transfers). This educational gradient in policy preferences has been largely unchanged since the 1940s. We then show the Democrats\u2019 supply of predistribution has declined since the 1970s. We tie this decline to the rise of a self-described \u201cNew Democrat\u201d party faction who court more educated voters and are explicitly skeptical of predistribution. Consistent with this faction\u2019s growing influence, we document the significant growth of donations from highly educated donors, especially from out-of-district donors, who play an increasingly important role in Democratic (especially \u201cNew Democrat\u201d) primary campaigns relative to Republican primaries. In response to these within-party changes in power, less-educated Americans began to leave the Democratic Party in the 1970s, after decades of serving as the party\u2019s base. Roughly half of the total shift can be explained by their changing views of the parties\u2019 economic policies. We also show that in the crucial transition period of the 1970s and 1980s, New Democrat-aligned candidates draw disproportionately from more-educated voters in both survey questions and actual Congressional elections.\n\n",
