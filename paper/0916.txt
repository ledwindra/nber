Productivity Growth and R&D aL the Business Level:
Results From the PIMS Data Base

AB STRACT

This paper presents the results of a study of productivity growth and

R&D in the 1970s using data on narrowly defined 'business units within a
firm. Estimates are developed under different assumptions about technology,
industry effects, and changes in the return to R&D over time. The R&D data
are broken down into process and product expenditures, and some information

is available on past success in developing proprietary technology, and

results suggest a significant relationship between R&D and the growth of

productivity;

in versions using total factor productivity as the dependent

variable, the estimated rate of return to R&D investment is about 20 percent.

We find some evidence that R&D has its biggest effect on productivity in those
markets where major changes in technology have occurred in the recent past.

Previous success in developing proprietary process technology affects total
factor productivity directly, but appears to have little effect on estimated

returns to R&D. The notion that the productivity of R&D declined in the l970s
finds Little support in this data. Irrespective of model specification, trends
in the R&D coefficient are substantively arid statistically insignificant. Our
calculations suggest that reduced investment in R&D may have accounted for at
least 10 percent of the decline in total factor productivity growth in the l970s.

The recent slowdown in productivity growth in the U.S. and else-

where, increased the interest in understanding its determinants. Among
determinants commanding attention have been expenditures for research and

development. R&D investment has attracted attention because a slowdown in
its growth seemed to coincide with the productivity slowdown and because

earlier studies of the R&D-productivity connection had found R&D to be an

important determinant of productivity growth. Recent work on R&D and productivity growth presents, however, a relatively mixed picture. While studies
on 1950s and l960s data generally found positive effects, productivity
equations for the 1970s find the coefficient alternately collapsing (Griliches
(1980), Agnew and Wise (1973), Scherer (1981), and Terleckyj (1980)) and
reviving (Griliches and Lichtenberg (1981), Scherer (1981)) depending on

the data used and in particular on the level of aggregation. Where dis—
aggregated data were explored, a relatively sizeable effect of R&D was found,
even in the turbulent 1970s.

This paper presents the results of a study of productivity growth
and R&D in the 1970s using data on narrowly defined "business units" within

a firm. The principal focus of the analysis is estimation of the productivity
of R&D at the margin. Estimates are developed under different assumptions
about technology, industry effects, and changes in the return to R&D over time.

Our R&D data are classified into process and product expenditures and we
examine the effect of proprietary technology and technological opportunity
on R&D productivity.

The results reported below suggest a significant relationship between
R&D and the growth of productivity; in versions using total factor productivity
as the dependent variable, the estimated marginal product or rate of return is

-2about 18 percent. There is no evidence in this data of a deterioration in
the productivity of R&D in the 1970s. Irrespective of model specification,
trends in the R&D coefficient are substantively and statistically insignificant.

We also find some evidence that all else equal, a shift in the mix toward more
product R&D lowers the measured rate of growth of productivity, and that
R&D has its biggest effect on productivity in those businesses where major
technical changes have occurred within the recent past.

The paper has three parts. We first discuss the data used and
present summary information about our key variables. Particular attention
is paid in the first section to the reported price indexes. Estimates of
price changes in the PIMS data are compared with estimates based on govern-

ment surveys. Part two of the paper sets out the analytical framework
and presents estimates of the effect of R&D on productivity under several

model specifications. The paper concludes with a brief summaiy and some
suggestions for further work.

I. The Data Set
The data we use are drawn from the PINS project of the Strategic

Planning Institute) The Institute is composed of over 1500 member companies
which participate in the project by supplying annual data on individual busi-

nesses within the company. Our sample covers 924 U.S. manufacturing businesses
over the period 1970-1980.

A "business" in the PINS lexicon is a unit of the firm "selling a
distinct set of products to an identifiable set of customers in competition
with a well defined set of competitors." Businesses tend to be syrionomous
with operating divisions of the company but may be defined in terms of

-3product lines within divisions. In addition to annual income statements
and balance sheets, each business provides information on several measures
of market structure, technology, previous competitive experience, and com-

petitive strategy. Along with its panel structure and level of detail, the
richness of the PillS data set makes it a potentially valuable source of information on the determinants and impact of R&D.

But richness has its price. Several aspects of the data must be
kept in mind in interpreting the evidence presented below. In the first
place, we are not dealing here with typical or representative firms. The
companies in the project tend to be large diversified corporations, many are
found in the Fortune 500, and almost all of them are found in the Fortune 1000.
The analysis thus deals with the impact of R&D on productivity among a set of
firms which may not be representative of all firms in a given sector, but

which probably account for a significant fraction of the assets and people
employed.

The unit of observation is a further problem. Although SPI provides guidelines for defining "business units", the choice is left to the
company and will depend on the availability of data and the company's

assessment of the usefulness of the definition.2 In a related fashion,
much of the structural data is subject to the company's assessments and

perceptions. Of course, a good deal of the information requested by SPI
is available through accounting systems, and subject to uniformity of

definition and guidelines developed and imposed by SPI. But variables
like the number of competitors, or the relative quality of the business's
products depend to some extent on the respondents' perceptions.

-4--

Finally, the self—reported character of the data and its use in
comparative modeling raises questions about its quality and integrity. Two
considerations suggest that the quality of the data is reasonably high.
First, the information requested is of value to the business (e.g., its mar-

ket share) and it seems reasonable to suppose that the firm is in a position

to know and has expended effort to acquire accurate data. Second, a firm's
participation in the project is motivated by a desire to use the data in the
strategic planning models developed by the Institute.

Considerable effort

is made to preserve confidentiality and ensure quality: only the firms
themselves have access to their own data; sensitive variables (e.g., profits)

are only reported in disguised or ratio form; analysts at SPI run the data
through an elaborate procedure to check for consistency, and gross errors

are followed up with the company
Major Variables
The annual income statement and balance sheet provided by each firm
can be used to construct measures of productivity, R&D, and capital. We use

sales, deflated by an index of product prices as the basic measure of output.
Although available information permits calculation of value added, we found
that treating materials as a separate factor of production fit the data

much better. The output price index and an index of materials prices are
provided by the business under guidelines set forth by SPI.

The guidelines

define the relevant concept of output price as a weighted average of

the business's selling prices, holding the mix of products constant. Since
the quality of the output and productivity series depends on the quality of
the output price indexes, they are examined below in more detail.

-5Information on labor input is limited. The only variable available
to us is the number of employees and that is only available on a disguised

basis, and thus can only be used in ratio form. There are no data on hours
per employee, nor are the data broken down by occupation or type of employ-

ment. Output per employee and capital-labor ratios are defined for all
employees, including sales, and managerial personnel, as well as those engaged

in R&D activities and production. These variables are not adjusted for differences in quality, since no wage data, or data on education or other characteristics are available.

Estimates of the real stock of capital are derived from information

on the firm's balance sheet and annual investment. The value of plant and
equipment in the firm is reported at historical cost, but each firm provides

an estimate of the replacement value of gross plant and equipment in the

initial year of its participation in the survey. This gives an initial
capital stock value in current prices. Since firms may enter the sample
in different years we restate the initial value in current prices into
constant (1972) dollars using the deflator for business fixed investment

(BFI) from the National Income and Product Accounts. Subsequent investment in plant and equipment is deflated by the BFI price index and added

to the initial year stock. The investment series we use is net of retirements, but we have not subtracted out reported depreciation.3 In order to

provide a comparative perspective we shall estimate the models using gross
book value of capital as well as the stock of capital adjusted for inflation
as described above.

As with most data sets, information on R&D comes in the form of

current spending. Expenditures on research and development are treated as

-6-

an expense in the PIMS accounting system and are, therefore, reported in the

income statement. Businesses are asked to include in this category all
expenses (material, labor, etc.) incurred to improve existing products or
to develop new products, and all expenses for improving the efficiency of

the manufacturing process. Total R&D expenditures are thus classified into
product and process categories. How that split is implemented, however, is
left to the business to decide. All R&D expenses are specific to the business
and exclude charges for research and development done in a central corporate

facility. They may, however, include expenses which are shared with other
business, but conducted below the corporate level.

Table 1 presents definitions, means and standard deviations of the

basic variables used in the analysis. The sample covers 924 businesses, with
a total of 4,146 observations; not all firms are present in each year, so

the design of the sample is unbalanced. Data on real sales, materials and
capital per employee show a substantial amount of variability around rela-

tively high average rates of growth. In real terms, sales per employee grew
at an annual rate of 4 percent in these data, while capital and materials per

person grew at rates between 3.5 and 4.0 percent. The data on newness of
the capital stock (ratio of net to gross book value) suggest that, on average,

productivity growth occurred during a period in which the capital stock was
aging.

Variables measuring R&D intensity and mix are in line 2. These data
are of a reasonable order of magnitude, and imply that the businesses in the

sample cover a wide range of R&D intensities. As in data collected at other
levels of aggregation, the majority of R&D (65 percent) is devoted to improving

old or developing new products. Although the sample covers most of the 2-digit

in chemicals, electrical and nonelectrical machinery and instruments.
We have used the PIMS data to calculate R&D intensity for these
two-digit industries, as well as for primary and fabricated metal products,

and compared them to data published by the NSF. This comparison, presented
in Table 2, shows the same ranking of industries by R&D intensity in the

two data sets. Since the NSF is a company based data set, and since the
mix of sub-industries within the 2-digit industries may not be identical,
differences in the R&D-to-sales ratio in the two series are to be expected.
But the two sources yield intensity estimates that are quite similar. Only
in Machinery (SIC 35) does a sizeable discrepancy emerge.
We make no attempt to estimate the stock of R&D capital, but rather
use R&D intensity to capture the effects of R&D on productivity. In order to
allow for lagged effects and to break any spurious correlation induced by
the presence of lagged output as an independent variable, we

define sales R&D

intensity as:

The last-variable indicates whether "major" technological change

(either product or process) has occurred in the business or in its major com-

petitors in the last eight years. These questions are asked only once (when
the business enters the PINS project) so that the dummy variables are con-

stant over time. The data suggest that a sizeable fraction of the businesses
have carried out R&D projects which have led to patents or some other form of

proprietary products or processes. An issue we examine below is whether R&D
capability defined in this way affects the current connection between R&D
investments and productivity.

The mean growth rates of the basic variables are of a reasonable
order of magnitude, but a somewhat more detailed look at the data, particu-

larly at the output price series, seems in order. Although our focus is
productivity, the measures of output which underly the analysis are only as

good as the price indexes used to deflate nominal sales. A full—scale
analysis of the data is beyond the scope of this paper, but we can provide
some perspective by comparing rates of change of prices in the PINS data

with those found in the statistics published by the government. To do that
we have focused on price changes in a group of industries where the number
of observations available in the PINS data set is sufficient to justify comparison with the published figures.

The last number is the number of PINS' firms in the industry in

that year. The comparisons in Table 2 are necessarily rough. Because the
mix of 4-digit industries underlying the PINS 2-digit calculations is different than the mix used in the BEA calculations, it is not reasonable to

expect the two sources to yield identical estimates. However, to the extent
that similar economic forces affect the constituent 4-digit industries in
similar ways, a 2-digit level comparison should give us some idea of comparability.

Perhaps the most noticeable aspect of tile BEA/PINS comparison in

Table 3 is the similar pattern of change over time. Both data sets generally
show small changes in prices in the first three years, followed by an explosion in 1974-75, with rates of price increases running as high as 25-30 per-

cent in some industries. In the latter part of the period the rate of change
is once again much smaller, although higher than the rates found at the

beginning of the decade.
Amidst this broad pattern of similarity there are clear differences

between the published data and the data from PINS. In most of the industries,
for example, the 1974-75 explosion in prices shows up earlier in the PINS

data, but lasts longer in the BEA estimates.4 A comparison of the sums of the
rates of change in the two years (1974-75) yields values much closer together

than comparisons of the years taken individually. Even before the oil shock
and the expiration of controls, the two data sets show different patterns in

some years in several industries. In fact, the comparisons before the oil
shock are much more diverse than those made in the 1976-1979 period. Although
differences are present in the latter period, the large discrepancies found

- 13

in

—

the 1971-74 period are less frequent. This pattern may reflect the influ-

ence of wage-price controls on reporting practices, or the different sources
of inflationary pressure in the two periods.

pirica1 Analysis

The connection between R&D and productivity growth is studied in

the context of a fairly conventional model. In its simplest form, output (Q)
business at time t. is assumed to be a function of the stock of

of the

capital (C), the number of employees (L), accumulated investment in R&D (K)
and a factor accounting for disembodied technical change (AeXt) as in
= AeXt

(1)

Q (K.t, L., C.)

It is standard procedure to assume that Kit can be represented by a

distributed lag of past investments in R&D, with the weights presumed to
depend on the way in which past activities affect the current state of
technical knowledge.

Assuming the production function is Cobb Douglas, and separable
in R&D, we can totally differentiate (1), and rearrange terms to derive an
expression in terms of rates of growth:
q. = X +

where y and

yk. +

c.

+ (1 -

a)2.

(2)

are output elasticities with respect to R&D and capital, and

lower case letters have been used to indicate relative rates of growth of
their upper-case counterparts (e.g., k =

(dK/dt)/K).

Note that we have

assumed constant returns to scale with respect to the conventional measures

of capital and labor. Rearranging terms yields a productivity equation:

(q-).=X+yk.+a(c-).
where (q -

£).

(3)

is the growth rate of labor productivity, and Cc - 2). is the

rate of growth of the capital-labor ratio.

The effect of R&D is measured by y; estimation in this context

requires data on the growth of the stock of R&D capital. If, however,
investments in R&D do not depreciate, then data on R&D intensity can be

used to capture the R&D effect. If R. is R&D expenditure in year t,

— 15 —

then k. =

and yk. = p [R./Q.}, where p is the marginal product

of R&D. Under competitive assumptions p can also he interpreted as the
rate of return.5 Because employment and capital employed in R&D have
not been segregated explicitly this is an excess return to R&D expenditures.

Further, it is a private return because the data pertain to individual

businesses. Returns which accrue to other firms and investors are not
captured here.

Equation (3) provides a starting point for empirical analysis but

several adjustments seem warranted. In the first place, the model as specified ignores the role of intermediate products in production by implicitly
assuming that materials (including purchases of intermediate products and

energy) are proportional to output.6 This problem can be dealt with by
using information on purchases to expand the input list. It is of course
possible to use data on materials to calculate a value added version of

output. But this too makes assumptions about the nature of the production
process (e.g., materials are used in fixed proportion) which may not apply

across all firms. While we have used materials in both ways, treating
them explicitly as an input yields much better statistical results and we

shall focus on such results in the empirical work reported below. The variable we use is total purchases deflated by an index of materials prices.7
One of the reasons for adding materials as an input is our view
that the technology of production is likely to vary across firms and in-

dustries. If that is true, estimation of (3) without adjustment could lead
to misleading inferences about R&D. A first cut at this problem is to add
a set of industry dummies, so that parameter estimates are based on variation
in productivity and its determinants within industries, with each industry

— 16 —

having its own value of X. Firm specific variations in technology can be
introduced by casting the estimation problem in a total factor productivity

framework. Instead of estimating the output elasticities of capital and
materials directly, we can use the observed factor shares for each business
as an approximation (the two are identical in competitive equilibrium).

After rewriting the R&D variable in intensity form, adding materials
and industry dummies, and using factor shares, equation (3) becomes:

share can be calculated directly, since it is simply the value of purchases

divided by sales. No data are provided on the wage bill, however, hence
capital's share was estimated as depreciation plus profits divided by sales.8

Profits are defined gross of R&D expenditures (we treat R&D as an investment), but net of marketing expenses.9
The specification of the basic productivity equation is based on

what is essentially a long-term perspective. It is assumed that movements
in total factor productivity reflect movements in the production frontier

caused by R&D investment and disembodied technical change. In practice,
businesses may deviate from the frontier, not only because of errors in optimization, but because of disequilibrium phenomena associated with fluctuations
in demand and consequent changes in utlization.

— 17 —

One way to incorporate such factors into the model is to assume

that the production function (and thus productivity growth) is composed of a

long-term and a short-term component. R&D and disembodied technical change
are assumed to affect only the long-term component in the manner specified in

(4). The short-term component is specified to be a simple linear function of
capacity utilization. Cast in growth rate form, these assumptions introduce
the rate of change of capacity utilization as a variable in the analysis.

The Main Results
Estimates of several versions of the basic productivity model are

presented in Table 4. The dependent variable in columns (l)-(4) is the rate
of growth of real sales per employee, while the growth of total factor produc-

tivity (TFP) is examined in columns (5) and (6). In.addition to R&D intensity, the model includes variables measuring the R&D mix, the growth of
capacity utilization and the newness of the capital stock, and the percent

of employees unionized. Capital and materials per employee are included as
independent variables in (l)-(4), and are incorporated into the dependent
variable in the TFP regressions.
Irrespective of specification, the estimates in Table 4 show a sig-

nificant effect of R&D on the growth of productivity. In column (1), the
model yields an estimated rate of return to R&D investment of 0.18, with a

standard error of 0.05. The utilization rate, as well as capital and
materials per employee are significantly related to sales per employee.

Correcting capital for inflation appears to have little effect on the esti-

mated R&D effect. When the growth of gross book value per employee is substituted for c-. in column (1), for example, the estimated return to R&D is
still 0.18.

The newness variable has a negative sign, while unionizati-ori's
impact is statistically insignificant. It is possible that the sign of the
newness variable reflects measurement problems as well as the differential

effects of newer capital. Although capital has been adjusted for inflation,
the procedure relies on estimates of replacement value in the first year of

participation in the survey. To the extent that the correction fails to
remove the effects of inflation, the rate of increase in the stock of capital
will be overstated, a problem likely to be more serious for newer equipment.
in fact, when column (1) is estimated with the book value of capital, the

newness variable remains negative but increases by thirty percent. It is
also possible that the negative sign that remains after the inflation cor-

rection, is due to adjustment costs of new capital. The integration of new
equipment into existing plants, or the start-up of new facilities, may

require time and effort to bring on line, and may be disruptive to existing
operations.

Measurement problems may also be a factor in the estimates of

product-process mix effects. There is an indication in the coefficients on
RHIX that an increase in product R&D's share in total R&D investment is

associated with a lower rate of growth of productivity. High shares of
product R&D may indicate a high rate of new product introduction which may
be associated with lower rates of growth of productivity, for two reasons.
First, much like new equipment, new products tend to be disruptive to

established production processes. Product introductions generally involve
a start-up and debugging phase of varying length in which new equipment or

new tasks are specified and learned. Productivity growth is likely to suffer

- 20

-

as a result. Second, where new products are an important aspect of competition, the business may adopt a process technology which is relatively adapt-

able and flexible. The firm is likely to avoid equipment and processes which
are dedicated to a specific product and thus somewhat rigid; There is likely
to be some sacrifice in productivity in the interests of flexibility. Although some of this should be picked up in the capital-labor ratio, this

variable is likely to be too broad and rough to capture the distinctions we

have in mind. It is well known, for example, that a highly capital-intensive
machine shope can be quite flexible in adapting to new products. The R&D
mix effect may, therefore, be an indication of the type of technology and
the importance of new products.
While the possibilities are interesting, too much should not be

made of the mix effect. The distinction between product and process R&D is
likely to involve a good deal of arbitrariness. This arises because the
guidelines are vague, and because the distinction may not be meaningful at

this level. Not only are process and product efforts jointly pursued on a
project basis, and thus difficult to disentangle, but even pure product

development can change the efficiency of the process. A new product design,
for example, may lead to a reduction in the number of operations required
or in a simplication of tasks, so that labor input is reduced even without

any capital investment. Furthermore, if higher product R&D is associated
with new products, and if firms base the price index on a fixed set of
products, the reported rates of inflation may overstate the extent of price

change. Output and productivity growth may, therefore, be understated.
The fact that the standard errors on RNIX are relatively large given the

— 21 -

number of observations lends some support to the importance of measurement
error.

The finding of a significant effect of R&D on productivity is unaffected by the specifications changes introduced in columns (2)-(6).
Column (2) adds 2-digit industry dummies, which allows each industry to

have its own trend term. Estimation within industries has little effect
on the results. In line (3), a new version of the capital and materials
variables is used. The new variables are the rates of growth of capital
and materials per employee multiplied by their average shares in sales.
If the technology were Cobb-Douglas, and the businesses fully competitive,

then coefficients on the new variables should equal unity. The materials
and capital coefficients are significantly different from one in a statisti-

cal but not substantive sense, implying that the Cobb-Douglas specification

is not too far off the mark. It is clear that the fit of the equation
deteriorates only marginally when the average shares are imposed, and these
changes, with or without industry effects, have little impact on the estimated return to R&D investment.

The same is true of the TFP equations in columns (5) and (6). We
estimate that R&D had a return of 20 percent in the TFP results, slightly
higher than the estimate in columns (1) and (2), but essentially similar

to the earlier results. The other coefficients are little changed as well,
although the newness variable declines from -.05 to -.03. As before, the
industry dummies have no effect on the results.

Proprietary Knoweidge, R&D Capability and Technological Opportunity
Estimates of R&D's effect on productivity in Table 4 are obtained

under the assumption of a common effect across businesses. While differencing
has eliminated fixed firm effects from the production function formulation,

- 22

firms

-

may also differ in their abflity to translate R&D effort into actual

products or processes. The productivity of R&D investment may depend on
the "opportunity" for technical change in the firm's product or process.
Some firms participate in industries where the scientific knowledge related to the product or process technology is rich and growing, while
others use techniques where the possibility of new understanding is much
more limited. ?loreover, where the potential for innovation is high, firms
of
may differ in their ability to exploit those opportunities because

differences in organization or management skill.
The likelihood of interfirm differences in technical opportunity and
R&D capability suggests that the average

effect of R&D in Table 4 may mask

A simple way to model the distinction

between R&D effort (expenditures on R&D) and R&D output (new products or
processes) and consequent gains in productivity

is to assume that p is a

function of the firm's R&D capability (and/or technical opportunity). If
we assume that past R&D success is an indicator of that ability and are willing to specify a linear relationship between p and past success, we can write
(6)

p=b0+b1P
where b and b1 are parameters and P indicates previous

R&D success (e.g.,

patents). It seems reasonable to allow for the possibility that past R&D
success may affect productivity independent

of the current R&D effort. The

total factor productivity model then becomes

newness and industry have

- 23

-

Although we have no data on the number of patents the businesses
have produced, we have three variables that provide some indication of R&D

capability, and technological opportunity. The first two are dummy variables
based on answers to the questions: does this business derive significant
benefit from (1) proprietary products, and/or (2) proprietary processes?
Patented products or processes are included in the definition, but firms are
also instructed to consider processes (products) regarded as proprietary but

not patented. The broader definition seems reasonable, since the decision
to seek a patent depends not only on the significance of the invention or
development, and potential gains, but also on the costs of the legal process.

Moreover, the firm may derive significant benefit from R&D results which are
not clearly patentable.

The third variable, is based on the question: have there been major
technological changes in the products or processes of this business or its

major competitors within the last eight years? Inclusion of the firm and
its competitors in the definition means that the variable provides information
about the potential for change and development in the technology used in the
industry, whether or not the firm itself has experienced a major change.

The fact that a firm or its competitors have experienced a major change in

technology can be interpreted in several ways. To the extent that an affirmative answer refers to the firm, one could infer that the firm has the capa-

bility to apply R&D and make use of the results. A similar conclusion would
apply to competitors. However, the change in technology could have come
through the purchase of equipment or licensing of new techniques rather than

the firm's own R&D effort. Whatever the source of change, the fact that it
has occurred implies the existence of further opportunities for technical
development.

- 24

It

-

is important to note, however, that asking a business about

the occurence of technical change may be equivalent to asking it about the

productivity of its R&D investments. In that sense, inferences about the
effects of technological opportunity based on the technical change variable
may have little substantive content, since the estimated coefficient would
be little more than a reflection of how accurately the businesses answered

the question. While the possible tautology between our measure of technical opportunity and R&D productivity remains in the analysis to follow,
it is mitigated to some extent by the fact that R&D

investments

are measured

in the previous period, while changes in technology may have occurred sometime in the previous eight years.

It would clearly be useful to have more information about what
firms have in mind when they answer yes to the technical change question.

The PIMS guidelines warn respondents only to answer in the affirmative if

there is no doubt that a major change has occurred. The meaning of the
variable measuring technical change and proprietary products and processes
deserves more analysis, but the nature of the data and the confidentiality
provisions of the PIMS project make an in-depth analysis difficult and

beyond the scope of this paper)°
Table 5 presents estimates of the TFP model after inclusion of our

measures for R&D capability and technical opportunity. Although the results
in line (1) with the proprietary product/process dummies show little change
in the R&D

dummy variables are interacted with R&D intensity in line (2), however, we

find little evidence of a significant relationship between R&D productivity

and proprietary technology. Each of the interaction terms has the same sign
as its dummy variable counterpart, but the coefficients are not statistically
significant.

Lines (3) and (4) present TFP estimates with the technological

change variable. While there appears to be no relationship between TIP
growth and DTECH, there is a strong connection between DTECH and R&D intensity;

the coefficient on RQDTECH is 0.24 and statistically significant. Moreover,
the coefficient on RQ(-1) in line (4) (which measures the R&D effect in busi-

nesses where DTECHO) is close to zero. If interpreted literally, the
results imply that R&D has no effect on productivity in businesses where

technical opportunities are apparently low. The connection between DTECH
and R&D intensity links these finding with results reported by Griliches
and Mairesse (1980), where R&D's largest effect on productivity was in

R&D intensive firms. While interesting and worthy of further analysis the
statistical evidence in line (4) can be overinterpreted. It is useful to
note that the addition of DTECH and its interaction with RQ(-1) has little
effect on the explanatory power of the equation.

Time Effects
Attention has been focused in recent years on possible changes in

the productivity of R&D over time. Using aggregated industry data (2-digit
SIC) from the 1970s, a number of researchers have documented the collapse

of what had been a relatively strong R&D effect. Griliches (1979), Terleckyj
(1980), Scherer (1980) and Kendrick and Grossman (1980) all find little
evidence in 2-digit level data that R&D affected productivity in the

- 27

-

post-1970 period. Once the data is disaggregated, however, some R&D effect
emerges. Griliches and Lichtenberg (1981), for example, find that the strong
relationships found in the l960s persisted into the later period.

Figure 1 presents a profile of the growth rates of TFP in the

PINS data and in published data on manufacturing. The published TFP estimates were prepared by Kendrick and Grossman. Their output measure is
based on real value added and labor input is total hours worked. The TFP
series from the PINS data shows a downward trend over the l970s, accompanied

by sharp fluctuations associated with the business cycle. A similar pattern
is apparent in the published data, although the timing and magnitude of

cyclical swings in the 1974-76 period are somewhat different. These differences likely reflect differences in price indexes noted earlier, and differences in output and input definitions.
We examine the question of a decay in the potency of R&D in Table 6,

where estimates of the TIP model with a time trend and time-R&D interaction

are presented. The specification also includes the variables measuring proprietary technology. Line (1) provdes a base case, with the time trend
entered separately without interaction with R&D intensity. It is evident
that TFP growth slowed over the period covered by the data. The coefficient
on TIME, negative and statistically significant, implies an average decline

of .2 percent per year. The productivity of R&D, however, shows no tendency
to decline. In line (2), the TIME-R&D intereaction term is negative, but its
standard error is quite large, and its actual value is quite small. The
estimate of —0.171, for example, implies a decline of 1.7 percentage points

in the rate of return over the decade of of the 1970s. Evaluated at the
midpoint of the time period, the implied rate of return in line 2 is 0.18,
quite close to the estimate in line 1.

Lines 3 and 4 present estimates of the TFP model in the sample of
firms where DTECHO, and in the sample where DTECH1. Looking first at
line (4), there is some indication of a sizeable drop in R&D productivity,

but the evidence is quite weak. The interaction term shows a decline of
4.8 percentage points per year in the return to R&D, but the standard error

is relatively large. At the midpoint of the time period, the estimated
return to R&D is -5 percent. When line (3) is re-estimated without the
time trend, or the interaction term, the return to R&D is 1.3 percent with
a standard error of 8.2.

In line (4) a very different picture emerges. As the estimates in
Table 5 indicated, R&D investment has a substantial impact on TFP growth in

businesses where a major change in technology has occurred. In 1975, for
example, the estimated return to R&D in line (5) is 26 percent. The interaction term implies a small increase of 0.3 percentage points per year in
the return to R&D, but, once again, the standard error is enormous.

The evidence thus suggests that if one looks at businesses where
technological opportunity apparently is high and where most of the R&D-productivity effect occurs, there is little statistical support for the notion

that the return to R&D declined in the 1970s. In the rest of the sample,
where the average return to R&D is very small, there is stronger support
for a decline in R&D productivity, but the data does not provide us with a

very precise estimate. Further analysis and data may help to clarify trends
in the return to R&D in businesses where technological opportunity is low,
but for now the evidence is inconclusive.

- 31

Conclusions a nd jpl ications

The estimates presented in Tables 4-6 suggest that R&D investment
has a significant positive effect on the growth rate of total factor produc-

tivity. All of the specifications examined yielded estimates of an 18-20

percent rate of return to R&D investment. We also found an important connection between the potency of R&D and technical opportunity. And while
use of proprietary process technology appears to increase TFP growth, there

is only weak statistical evidence of a relationship between the returns to

R&D and the use of proprietary processes. Finally the notion that the
potency of R&D declined in the l970s finds little support in this data.
Irrespective of model specification or sample used, the coefficient of the

time and R&D intensity interaction is both small and statistically insignificant.

The fact that R&D investment continued to have a strong positive
effect on productivity growth in the 1970s means that R&D may have played a

role in the slowdown of productivity growth. From the early 1970s to the
late 1970s, for example, the mean R&D to sales ratio fell from 2.7 to 1.9

percent in the PINS data. With a rate of return to R&D of 20 percent, this
would imply a decline of TFP growth of 0.16 percentage points, or about 10

percent of the decline observed over the period. We have found, however,
that most of the effect of R&D comes in businesses where technological

opportunity is high. Among those firms, a somewhat different perspective

emerges. In that group R&D intensity fell from 3.9 to 3.0 percent, while
at the same time TFP growth fell from 4.1 to 3.0 percent. With a return
to R&D of about 24 percent, the fall in R&D intensity could explain close
to 20 percent of the decline in productivity growth in the high technical
opportunity sector.

- 32
Further

-

Work
Our analysis has uncovered some interesting relationships and left

a nwnber of issues open for further research. One of these issues is the mix
between product and process R&D. Both the R&D mix variable and the variable
indicating the use of proprietary products had negative effects on produc-

tivity growth. This suggests the possibility of some interesting connections
between the product development process, choice of technology and growth of

productivity. Analysis of these questions in the PINS data (and probably in
other data sets as well) will have to confront serious measurement problems,
especially difficulties in the measurement of prices and output.
There is also the possibility of improving upon the statistical

methodology. All of the estimates presented here are based on ordinary least
squares. Except for the use of growth rates, which sweeps out fixed effects,

we have ignored the panel structure of the data. Using growth rates does
eliminate an important source of autocoreelation, but other formsof covariation in the residuals of a given business may be present, and could affect

our estimates. If the sample were balanced, there would be little difficulty
in applying some form of generalized least squares. An unbalanced design,
however, calls for an approach which accounts for the differences in numbers
of observations within a business over time in calculating the relevant
covariance matrix.

Finally, we have not examined explicitly the effect of R&D on

costs, prices and profits. It is well known that under competition, the
production function and TIP have a dual representation in the cost function
as the difference between the sum of share weighted input price growth rates

and the growth of the output price. Although we have no data on the "price"
of R&D, its effect in a price-side version of the TFP equation can be estimated using R&D intensity.

Footnotes
1. A description of the PINS data can be found in Schoeffler (1972). For
an analysis of R&D and profitability using the PINS data see Ravenscraft
and Scherer (1981).
2.

It should be noted that definition of a business as developed in the
PINS guidelines is based on the concept of a "strategic business unit."
This concept is spelled out in more detail in Abell and Hammond (1979).

3. The nominal investment series is calculated as the difference in the
gross book value of plant and equipment. It thus reflects both gross
investment and retirements. Estimates of real capital can be obtained
in other ways. One possibility is to estimate the age of capital using
the ratio of accumulated depreciation to annual depreciation, and then
adjust current book values based on changes in the BFI deflator since
the year the average piece of capital (determined by the age calculation)
was purchased. For an example of this approach see Griliches and
Mairesse (1981). Their results, as well as our own estimates reported
below suggest that the R&D estimates are relatively insensitive to
adjustments of this sort.
4. The use of these data to deflate industry level output would change the
estimated pattern of the productivity slow down quite a bit. It would
imply a much slower rise in the 1971-73 period, and much less of a fall
in 1975.

5. If R&D investments depreciate, as they most likely do, especially as
far as private returns are concerned (see Pakes and Schankerman, this
volume), then the equation is misspecified by leaving out a term of
the -ÔK/Q form. Since K/Q and R/Q are likely to be positively correlated, this omission may bias the estimated R/Q coefficient downward,
possibly by a rather large amount (since the R/Q coefficient in the
K/Q auxiliary equation is likely to be significantly about unity).
6. As Griliches and ?lairesse (1981) show, failure of the proportionality
assumption may induce bias into the estimated R&D effects.

7. The data set contains no breakdown of purchases into energy and other
intermediate inputs; use of aggregate purchases implicitly treats
materials and energy as interchangeable.
8. The use of total profits in the calculation of the share of physical
capital, is likely to overstate capital's share, since some of the
returns that accrue to R&D will be counted as return to capital. The
error thus introduced may lead to a downward bias in the estimate of
the rate of return to R&D. If total profits include returns to physical
capital and the stock of R&D capital, so that fl = rC + pK, then the

estimated share of capital will be equal to the true share plus the
elasticity of output with respect to R&D capital (note that p = y).
Q
Use of the estimated share in a total factor productivity framework
introduces -y.c. into the error term. If c and RQ(-l) are positively
correlated, etmates of p will be downward biased.
9.

In those cases where profits in a given year were negative for a given
firm, the average share for that firm was calculated excluding the
negative year.

10. While our ability to be precise about the substantive content of these
variables is limited, we have examined them for internal consistency.
A comparison of mean R&D intensity in samples selected on the basis of
the presence or absence of technical change (DTECH), and proprietary
technology (DPROD, DPROC) shows that firms with DTECH1 are almost
twice as R&D intensive as their DTECHO counterparts. A similar difference exists for firms where DPROD or DPROC equals one. We also
found that 45 percent of firms with DPROD1 answer yes to the question
about major technical change; for firms with DPRODO, the number is
23 percent. The results for DPROC are almost identical. This kind
of consistency also shows up in analysis by industry. Not only are
changes in technology correlated with proprietary products and processes
within industries, but the industrial focus of major technical change
is consistent with other information. The industries with high mean
values of DTECH - paper, chemical, plastics, transportation —equipment
are
(including aerospace), instruments and electrical equipment
industries where major changes in technology have occurred.
