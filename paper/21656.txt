ABSTRACT
We compare student academic performance in traditional twice-a-week and compressed once-a-week
lecture formats in introductory microeconomics between one semester in which students were randomly
assigned into the formats and another semester when students were allowed to choose their format.
In each semester we offered the same course with the sections taught at the same times in the same
classrooms by the same professors using the same book, software and lecture slides. Our study design
is modeled after a doubly randomized preference trial (DRPT), which provides insights regarding
external validity beyond what is possible from a single randomized study. Our goal is to assess whether
having a choice modifies the treatment effect of format. Students in the compressed format of the randomized
arm of the study scored -0.19 standard deviations less on the combined midterm and final (p<.01)
and -0.14 standard deviation less in choice arm (p<.01). There was little evidence of selection bias
in choice of format. Future analyses of online learning formats employing randomization should consider
DRPT designs to enhance the generalizability of results.

Just before the Internet became an important part of college instruction, David Romer
(1993) asked whether undergraduate students in a large introductory course of economics should
attend class. His results and those of subsequent papers strongly suggested that attendance
improved academic results.1 More than 20 years later, following the introduction of rich digital
learning environments, we now question whether face-to-face class time is even necessary.
While computers and the Internet have delivered a cornucopia of technological and pedagogical
innovations, the challenge of obtaining estimates of the causal effects of these innovations on
learning remains formidable.

A student’s decision to take classes online or in the classroom

may be correlated with her motivation, conscientiousness, ability, and other time constraints –
factors that also affect academic performance. Estimating how academic performance is affected
by a student’s choice of the location of learning (e.g. online, in the classroom, or a mixture of the
two) entails overcoming the same sources of bias facing past researchers in their pursuit of
causal estimates of attendance.
Recent studies of the effect of class format on student performance have attempted to
overcome potential selection biases by randomizing students into purely online, partially online
(i.e. “hybrid”) and traditional lecture classes. Although randomized experiments are of enormous
value in establishing causal effects, they are not without some shortcomings. First, students may
decide not to participate in a randomized experiment to avoid the risk of being assigned to a class
format that they do not prefer, undermining the generalizability of the experiment to the
population of interest. Second, the very act of being randomized to a class format rather than
choosing it could affect a student’s motivation and other psychological factors that also
potentially affect outcomes (Marcus et al. 2012). Third, outside of an experimental context,

students choose their class format and may do so to match their learning styles to the format that
most improves, or at least does not harm, their academic performance. Finally, the time, expense
and difficulty of randomized experiments limit their number.
These challenges have led to the development of the doubly randomized preference trial
(DRPT), in which subjects are first randomized into an experimental setting and a choice setting
(Janevic et al., 2003; Long, Little and Lin, 2008; Little, Long and Lin, 2008; Shadish, et al.,
2008).

In a DRPT, those in the experimental setting are then randomized again between

treatments while those in the choice setting select between treatments. The DRPT has many
advantages. Estimates from the choice and experimental arms, separately and together, all
generalize to the same population. The DRPT is also a rigorous “within-study” design that
enables estimation of the selection bias when subjects choose their treatment and potentially
identifies which control variables can reduce the selection bias (LaLonde 1986; Shadish, et al.
2008).

Finally, DRPTs have been used to estimate how choice of treatment alters treatment

effects. This is an important advantage of a DRPT over a randomized controlled trial (RCT)
when subjects are not blinded to which treatment they receive — a common feature of most
social science experiments.
Despite the proliferation of randomized designs in the social sciences, few studies have
used a DRPT. One reason may be the expense of recruiting more subjects in order to power both
the random and preference arms of the trial. Another drawback, as in any randomized trial, is
that subjects may not participate in the study because they still risk being assigned to a nonpreferred treatment. Even with these limitations, a DRPT can enhance substantially the external
validity of an intervention by estimating the effect of treatment choices on outcomes.

2

In this study we use a design similar to a DRPT to analyze whether students’ choice of
class format alters the estimate of class format on academic performance. We implemented a
randomized experiment and an observational choice study in successive academic years, where
all features were identical other than that we randomized in the first year and allowed students to
choose their format in the second. In the Fall of 2013, we randomized 725 students between a
traditional undergraduate lecture class of introductory microeconomics that met twice a week
(150 minutes) and a compressed format that met only once a week (75 minutes). Students in both
formats had access to the same lecture slides, online software, and videos. Joyce et al. (2015)
discusses the results of the randomized experiment in detail. In the fall of 2014, we offered the
same course taught at the same times, in the same classrooms, by the same professors using the
same book, software and lecture slides. We let the 769 students enrolled in the course choose
between a traditional and compressed format, however, and had them complete a survey
instrument to measure characteristics that could drive their choice of format, such as hours
worked and learning style. Finally, we compared the student performance on tests by format and
year.

We contend that the design approximates a DRPT because the Principles of

Microeconomics is required early in a student’s course of study, resulting in a distribution of
students between years “as if random” (Shadish, Cook, and Campbell pp. 302-3; Dunning pp.
235-39).
Our study has advantages over prior DRPTs despite the lack of explicit randomization
between the experimental and choice arms. In contrast to Shadish, Clark, and Steiner (2008), we
examine a high stakes course in a real world setting over an entire semester. Unlike Janevic et
al.’s (2003) medical DRPT in which 37% of eligible women agreed to participate, 96% of
students enrolled in the sections in our study participated in the randomized experiment (Fall

3

2013) and all students in the choice arm (Fall 2014) were included in the analysis. We therefore
have almost no issues of self-selection into the study and our results generalize to the population
of interest.
In our previous randomized experiment (Joyce et al., 2015), class time improved
performance, but less so in an Internet-rich environment than earlier studies of attendance
suggested. In the choice arm of the study, we find that class time improved performance even
less than in the randomized arm.

Differences in test scores between the traditional and

compressed formats when student chose their format are roughly 0.10 standard deviations less
(p<0.30) in favor of the traditional class than when students were randomized. We can interpret
the difference in treatment effects between the randomized and choice arms as the modifying
effect of treatment choice under the assumption that our controls remove all omitted variables
bias associated with choice of treatment.2

Factors that predict choice of format, such as

preferences for teacher and student interaction have little predictive power of student
performance, and strong correlates of student performance, such as grade point average, do not
predict students’ choice of format.
Two broad lessons emerge from our results. First, observational studies of the effect of
class time format may be subject to less bias than previously thought in large required
introductory classes, although this issue must be examined in a variety of settings. Second, our
attempt to approximate a DRPT provides a model for evaluating different learning formats in
higher education. DRPTs allow researchers to establish the internal validity of an intervention’s
estimate as well as its generalizability to non-randomized settings. This can make subsequent

This assumption is also known as “ignorability,” “no remaining confounding,” and “no common causes not
controlled for. “

observational studies more credible while avoiding the time, difficulty and expense of additional
randomized experiments.

I.

Previous Experimental Estimates
The most effective means of eliminating selection bias is by randomizing students

between formats, although executing a randomized design on campuses can be quite challenging
(Bowen et al. 2014).3 Figlio, Rush, and Yin (2013) compared students who took introductory
economics online versus a traditional lecture format at a major research university and found no
mean differences in test scores between formats. Their results were sensitive to the inclusion of
covariates, however. Students in the “live” format scored 3 points higher (out of 100) on the final
and 2.5 points higher on the average of all three exams than students restricted to the video-taped
lectures. They also found that performance deficits in the online class were greater for Hispanic
and students with below median GPAs.

Alpert, Couch and Harmon (2015) also randomized

students taking introductory microeconomics at a large state university. They contrasted student
performance on a cumulative final exam across three formats: traditional face-to-face classes,
blended or hybrid classes and classes delivered completely online.

They found no difference

between the traditional and the blended class but a roughly four percentage point deficit for
students in the online course. A third study with a randomized design, Bowen et al. (2014),
compared students in a hybrid versus traditional class of introductory statistics across six public

3

Researchers who have studied the effect of online formats on college student performance have used statistical
approaches to adjust for selection bias such as propensity score matching and control function methods (Coates, et
al. 2004; Anstine and Skidmore 2005; Gratton-Lavoie and Stanley 2009; Olitsky and Cosgrove 2014), instrumental
variables (Xu and Jaggers 2013; Bettinger et al. 2014), or fixed effects at the student, class or instructor level with
large state-wide databases (Xu and Jaggers 2013, 2014; Hart, Friedman and Hill 2014; Johnson and Mejia 2014).
Our focus here is those studies using randomized designs that are most comparable to ours.

universities. As in previous studies, they found no statistically significant differences between
formats on pass rates, final exam scores, and a standardized test of statistical literacy.
Joyce et al. (2015) used a randomized design to test whether students in a compressed
format of introductory economics performed as well as students in a traditional lecture format.4
Students in the traditional class scored 3.3 points higher (out of 100 or 0.21 standard deviations)
on the midterm (p<0.01) but only 1.6 points more or 0.11 standard deviations on the final
(p<0.14) relative to students in the compressed format. There were no differences in attrition or
online usage by format.
Although each of the four studies had strong claims to internal validity, whether they are
generalizable to other populations is unknown. In both Figlio, et al. (2013) and Bowen et al.
(2014), less than 25 percent of eligible students agreed to participate, while in Alpert, Couch and
Harmon (2015) 46 percent of students in an online class who enrolled in the experiment did not
take the final as compared to 30 and 36 percent in the face-to-face and blended formats,
respectively.5

It is unclear why students chose not to participate in the studies or to complete

the class once enrolled. For example, did students’ preferences for a traditional format prevent
risk-averse students from agreeing to randomization?

Is motivation to learn affected by

assignment to a non-preferred treatment arm? How might these factors affect estimates of
student performance in online formats when students choose a preferred style of class?

4

This study is the experimental arm of the present analysis.
Alpert, Couch and Harmon (2015) had 323 students in the study collected over four semesters. But they do not
report how many students take principles of microeconomics overall. Given the size of the university, the number
must be over one thousand.

II.

Empirical Framework
In a DRPT, eligible subjects who consent to the study are randomized between an

experimental arm and a choice arm. In the experimental arm subjects are randomized to the
treatments while in the choice arm subjects select their treatment. The DRPT has its origins in
the clinical literature in response to concerns about the generalizability of results from
randomized trials. One concern was the effect of treatment preferences on outcomes when
subjects were not blinded to their assignment.

Subjects who are disappointed with their

assignment or those who are enthusiastic may behave in ways that alter the results.6

A second

concern was that in many real-world settings, subjects choose their treatment, which may also
affect their response to treatment (Rucker 1989; Brewen and Bradley 1989; Wennberg et al.
1993; Awad et al. 2000). For example, in the Women Take Pride (WTP) study, Janevic et al.
(2003) used a DRPT to assess effectiveness of programs to enhance women’s management of
heart disease. They found that adherence was greater in the choice arm, although it had no effect
on health. Long, Little, and Lin (2008) re-analyzed the data from the WTP study and described
the assumptions necessary to identify preference effects in a DRPT. They defined preference
effects as the difference in treatment effects within preference strata (i.e., the causal effect of
treatment among those who prefer treatment minus the causal effect of treatment among those
who prefer the control, a double difference). They found that adherence was strongly affected by
treatment preference but a sickness index only modestly so.
Shadish, Clark and Steiner (2008) used a DRPT as a rigorous form of a within-study test
of selection bias as first presented by Lalonde (1986). In the canonical application of a within-

6

Cook and Campbell (1979) refer to “resentful demoralization” among subjects assigned to a non-preferred
treatment.

7

study design, a comparison group drawn from extant data representative of the population under
consideration is matched to the control group from the experiment. Because neither group has
been exposed to the intervention, differences in outcomes are attributed to selection bias.
Shadish, Clark and Steiner (2008) argue, however, that this form of within-study design
confounds selection bias with differences in control group populations and also potentially with
differences in measurement of outcomes and control variables (see also Heckman, Ichimura,
Smith and Todd 1998; Cook, Shadish and Wong 2008). A DRPT isolates the effect of selection
bias by construction, as randomization insures that subjects in the choice arm are drawn from the
same population as subjects in the randomized arm with the same measurement of all outcomes
and control variables. Shadish, Clark and Steiner’s (2008) DRPT examined the effect of math
versus vocabulary training on test performance among undergraduate psychology students. They
found that their extensive set of covariates eliminated treatment selection bias.
The assumptions underlying a DRPT are best illustrated within a potential outcomes
framework (Long, Little and Lin 2008; Marcus et al. 2012). Consider a student drawn from an
eligible population who has consented to participate in a study in which she will be randomized
to one of two arms, an experimental arm and a choice arm. If she is assigned to the experimental
arm she will be randomized again to one of two treatments. If she is randomized to the choice
arm she will choose one of the two treatments. In our context, the two treatments are a
compressed class format that meets once per week and a traditional class format that meets twice
per week.

The student therefore has four potential outcomes:

let Pfd be the potential

performance of the student in a course by format (f=1 is compressed, f=0 is traditional) and
design (d=1 is randomized, d=0 is choice).

Because of the double randomization in the

experimental arm we can express the potential outcomes as
8

E(P11 | f = 1,d = 1) = E(P11 ) and E(P01 | f = 0,d = 1) = E(P01 )

(1)

The treatment effect of format in the randomized design is therefore

δ r = E(P11 − P01 ) .

(2)

Equivalent expectations for students in the choice arm yields

( 3

(3)

giving the treatment effect in the choice arm:
𝛿! = 𝐸(𝑃!" − 𝑃!! )

(4)

The potential outcomes in the choice arm are unlikely to be independent of the choice of format,
however. Let x be a vector of student characteristics prior to the course. If we assume that
potential outcomes in the choice arm are independent of the design due to randomization and
independent of format conditional on x, then we can write the following:

Ex [E(P10 | f = 1,d = 0, x)] = E x [E(P10 | x)]

(5)

Ex [E(P00 | f = 0,d = 0, x)] = E x [E(P00 | x)]

(6)

and

allowing us to rewrite the treatment effect in the choice arm as

δ c = Ex [E(P10 − P00 ) | x]

(7)

If the variables in x capture all of the determinants of choice that are also related to outcomes,
then any difference between the estimated δr and δc represents the pure the effect of getting
one’s choice of treatment on student performance. “Choice” embodies a number of concepts that
cannot separately be identified. Students may choose a format because more class time helps
their learning or because less class time frees them to study more effectively on their own. If
students choose the format that they believe will improve their performance, then we would
expect to see smaller effects in the choice arm rather in the randomized arm. Students may
9

choose a format for other reasons, such as convenience, however, which could increase the
treatment effect of format between the two designs.

Regression specification
We use linear regression to estimate whether the choice of format alters the treatment
effect of format on student performance. We assume that students randomized in the fall of 2013
and students who choose their format in 2014 are balanced along all observed and unobserved
characteristics, i.e. that they were as good as randomly assigned between years. We show in
Table 1 below that our samples are remarkably balanced in the baseline characteristics of the
students in both academic years and will describe the institutional features justifying our
assumption that the unobservables are also likely balanced across years.

We estimate the

following model:

Pidf = α 0 +α 1Cif + α 2 Did + α 3 (Cif × Did ) + ∑ β k X kidf + εidf

(8)

where Pidf is the academic performance of student i, in design d, and format f. Let Cif be one if
the student is in the compressed format and 0 if in the traditional format. Let Did be one if the
student is in the randomized arm and zero if she is in the choice arm and let Xkidf be a vector of
covariates. A number of estimates are relevant from equation (5). First, α1 + α3 is the
difference in performance between the compressed and traditional formats in the randomized
arm (2013), whereas α1 is the same difference in the choice arm (2014). Thus, α3 is the
difference-in-differences or the treatment effect of being in the compressed format relative to the
traditional format in the randomized relative to the choice arm. We know from Joyce et al.
(2015) that students in the compressed format of the randomized design had lower test scores

10

than students in the traditional format. If choosing one’s format improves performance then α3
should be negative.

Setting and course
As noted previously, we randomized 725 students in the fall of 2013 between a
traditional lecture format of introductory microeconomics that met twice a week for 150 minutes
and a hybrid or compressed format that met once a week for 75 minutes. In the fall of 2014 we
offered the exact same course taught by the same professors at the same times and in the same
classrooms. Instead of randomizing students between formats, however, 769 students enrolled in
the format of their choice.7 As in the randomized design, both professors were listed as the
course instructors so that students’ choices were based on format and schedule.
A detailed description of the course is presented in Joyce et al. (2015); here we briefly
summarize key aspects. Principles of Microeconomics (ECO 1001) is a required course for all
students applying to the business program at Baruch College’s Zicklin School of Business.8 It
also fulfills a social science requirement for non-business majors. Nearly one thousand students
take ECO 1001 each fall. The City University of New York (CUNY) registrar listed the classes
as traditional and hybrid. The CUNY registrar defines a course as a hybrid if between 30 to 79
percent of course material that would have been presented face-to-face is instead presented
online.

7

Eighty-nine students in the choice arm of the study were not enrolled in their preferred format base on the precourse survey because of scheduling or lack of availability.. We report results dropping those students below.
8
Baruch College, part of the City University of New York (CUNY) and one of the most diverse campuses in the
country. As of the 2013-2014 academic year, the Baruch student body claimed 163 nationalities and spoke 110
languages. Baruch’s Zicklin School of Business is the largest accredited collegiate school of business in the country
with 12,000 undergraduates. Almost all students commute to campus and most attend full-time.

11

In both 2013 and 2014 all sections used N. Gregory Mankiw’s Principles of
Microeconomics (6th Edition) as the textbook, along with Cengage Learning’s Aplia web
application to administer and grade online quizzes. Each week students in both the traditional
and compressed format took a “pre-lecture quiz” due on Sundays and covering material to be
taught in the upcoming week, and a “post-lecture quiz” due on Saturdays covering material that
had been taught during the week. The pre-lecture quizzes were pass/fail (students who correctly
answered at least half of the questions received full credit for the quiz) and were generally easier
than the post-lecture quizzes which were graded as a percentage of 100. The midterm and final
accounted for 35 and 45 percent of their course grade, respectively. Grades on the Aplia quizzes
accounted for the 20 percent.
Our analysis hinges on the year in which students take the course as being as good as
randomly assigned. Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics of students in both years of the
study – they are comparable in every way. Our identification strategy also depends on the
unobservable characteristics being comparable across years and there are several institutional
reasons we expect that this is so. Economics 1001 is required for applying to the business school
(and some other majors) at Baruch.

Students have no non-honors, daytime alternatives to the

sections used in the study during both years. Moreover, students cannot postpone taking the
course without educational and possibly even financial consequences.

Data
Our primary outcome measures are academic performance on exams and the final course
grade. We administered both the midterm and final exams in class, and on both tests the same
questions were used in all four sections within each semester. The midterm and final consisted of
30 and 40 multiple choice questions, respectively. We attempted to keep the content of exam
12

questions and their difficulty as similar as possible between the two years but to control for any
(small) differences, we standardize scores on all tests to have a mean of zero and standard
deviation of one. We also analyzed withdrawal rates, counting as withdrawals students who
enrolled in the class but failed to finish.
We obtained student characteristics prior to enrollment in the course from Baruch
College’s Office of Institutional Research and Program Assessment. These data included age,
race/ethnicity, language spoken at home, major (if declared), grade point average (GPA), SAT
scores, and cumulative credits. Some students have a GPA at Baruch, while transfer students
have only GPAs from their former college. Former transfer students have both GPAs. In the
regression analysis that follows, we include both GPAs and indicator variables for missing one
or both of those GPAs.9 We also do not have SAT scores for all students because not all transfer
students were required to submit their SAT scores to Baruch during the admissions process.
Rubin (2007, 2008) and Cook, Shadish and Wong (2008) advocate estimating causal
effects in observational studies by prospectively investigating and measuring all possible factors
driving treatment selection so that they can be used as control variables (through propensity
scores or other means). We used evidence in other settings (Shadish, Clark, and Steiner, 2008),
instructor familiarity with students and the course, and informal interviews with past ECO 1001
students to hypothesize that student choice of compressed or traditional format might be affected
by a variety of time constraint, preference, and learning style factors: commuting time, hours of
work; general in-person vs. online/electronic orientation; general in-person vs. online/electronic
learning style; risk aversion; experience with online format; and preference for quantitative

9

We have a GPA measure for about 78% of our sample. Baruch accepts many transfer students, particularly from
other CUNY schools, and an additional 15% of the sample has information on their GPA at the school from where
they transferred. About 20% of our sample has both a GPA measure from Baruch and from their previous
institution.

13

courses. We developed a detailed questionnaire to measure these characteristics and administered
it within the first week of class in 2014.

A copy of the survey instrument is presented in the

Appendix. Students received 3-extra-credit points added to the final course average if they
completed both the pre-course and post-course surveys on time and 1.5 credits if they completed
just one. CUNY’s Institutional Review Board also required that students who did not want to
participate in the survey be provided an alternative assignment for the same credit. Of 676
students who completed the class 648 (95.9%) competed the pre-course survey.
During the experimental year, a more limited pre-survey was administered, which
included working hours. Crucially, students were also asked which format they preferred but
only during the first week of classes and after they had been assigned to a format. Since students
were randomized, their preferred format should have been balanced between those in the
compressed and traditional formats; it was not, however, suggesting that students’ reported
preferences were altered by their assignment. Such effects are consistent with endowment effects
in the psychology literature (e.g., Kahneman, Knetch and Thaler 1991). Nonetheless, we still
have a measure of format preference in the experimental year and have the same measure in the
choice year. While most students obtained their preferred format in the choice year, some
students were unable to obtain their preferred format, or their preferred format at their preferred
time slot.

III. Results

Analyzing balance by year and format
Characteristics of students who finished the course in the randomized arm in 2013 and
the choice arm in 2014 are displayed in Table 1. We show the absolute differences, normalized
14

differences and the log of the ratio of standard deviations between years. Based on a t-test, only
the only statistically significant difference is the verbal SAT scores. Neither the normalized
differences or the ratio of the standard deviations, however, suggest the difference in verbal SAT
scores by year will cause important imbalance in the regressions. For the rest of the variables,
the assessment of balance reveals no substantive concerns.

Also of note is the lack of a

difference in withdrawal rates. In each year between 10 to 12 percent of students withdraw,
which is similar to the withdrawal rate in 2013 (Joyce et al. 2015). Moreover, the characteristics
of students by format remain balanced if we include those who withdrew.10 Thus, we have
support, based on observables, that students in our study appear as if they were randomly
distributed between the two years (study arms), a key assumption of a DRPT.
We also compare differences by format within each year in Table 2.

As expected,

characteristics are balanced by format in 2013 when students were randomly assigned. There is
also no evidence of any meaningful imbalance by format along those observable characteristics
in 2014 when students chose their format. Clearly, from this evidence, we do not know if there
is imbalance in unobservables in the choice arm of 2014. We do know, however, that a) both
observed and unobserved characteristics are balanced in 2013; b) there is balance in observables
between 2013 and 2014; and c) there is balance by format in the same variables within the choice
arm in 2014. We therefore have plausible support for a key assumption necessary to identify
choice effects: that conditional on covariates, treatment effects in the randomized and choice

Regression estimates
Table 3 shows the regression results for the midterm, final, the combined midterm and
final, the course grade and the probability of withdrawal.

For each we show the effect of the

compressed class relative to the traditional class in 2013 and 2014. The odd columns include a
limited set of covariates and the even columns include a larger set.

Coefficients show

differences in standard deviations of standardized test scores and grades and differences in the
probability of withdrawal. Students in the compressed format in 2013 scored between -0.14 and
-0.22 standard deviations less in tests and their final grade. Format had no effect on differential
withdrawal rates. In 2014, when students chose their format, those in the compressed format
also scored lower, between -0.13 and -0.16 standard deviations, than in students in the traditional
format.
Our test of whether student choice of format in 2014 modified the treatment effect was
the difference in estimates of the compressed format in 2013 versus 2014. All differences were
negative indicating that a positive effect of class time on academic performance decreases when
students choose a format. However, differences were small. They ranged from -0.01 to -0.08
standard deviations across all measures of academic performance and none was statistically
significant. Put differently, the option to choose a class format did not substantively mitigate the
loss of class time on performance.

Estimates within professor/classroom
In Table 4 we show separate estimates within professor/classroom.

The essential

inferences form Table 3 persist but some differences are notable. First, there is no evidence of
16

selection bias within each professor/classroom. The performance of students who chose the
traditional format was no different from those who were randomized into it.

This is evidence

that a key assumption of the DRPT holds and that comparison of treatment effects between the
randomized and choice arms of the study reflect the effect of choice of format on performance.
In the larger classroom taught by professor B we find that the effect of the compressed format
when students choose is approximately half as large as when students are randomized.
Differences range from -0.06 to -0.13 standard deviations. These are not statistically significant
from the estimates in the randomized design, but they are consistently smaller in magnitude
suggesting that choice of format improved performance. The same pattern exists in the smaller
classroom with professor A, although standard errors are substantially larger and estimates are
more sensitive to adjustment.

Robustness checks
Eighty-nine students in the choice arm of the study were not enrolled in their preferred
format base on the pre-course survey. Enrollment in the compressed class was full whereas
enrollment in the traditional class was not, which suggests that the 89 students were constrained
from taking the compressed format.

We dropped these 89 students and re-estimated the

regressions in Table 3. The results were essentially the same. For example, the difference in
student performance on the combined midterm and final between the compressed and traditional
formats in the randomized versus the choice arm is -0.06 (-0.05 in the full sample) with a
standard error of 0.09. None of the other results differed meaningfully when the 89 students
were dropped.

Another issue is that the professors may have become more effective in

delivering the compressed class in the second year relative to the first and it is possible that
17

greater instructor experience and not choice of format may account for the relative improvement
in test scores, albeit small, in the compressed format of the choice arm. We find no evidence to
support this, however. In results available from the authors by request,, the effect of being in the
compressed format did not differ between years.

Determinants of format
Results of the pre-class survey administered to students in the choice arm are shown in
Table 5. As indicated in column (3), most questions used a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1
(strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree) with 3 representing neutrality (neither agree or disagree).
Treating the Likert responses as quantitative variables, columns (1) and (2) give the average
score for each question for students in the traditional and compressed sections, respectively.
Column (4) shows the chi-square test of independence among response categories for the full 2
(format) by 5 (scale) table for each question. Relatively few questions are associated with choice
of format. Those who agreed that traditional lectures worked well for them were more likely to
choose the traditional format, while those who agreed that their learning style was well-suited to
a hybrid format were more likely to choose the compressed class.

Those who preferred

quantitative to writing-focused courses were more likely to choose the compressed format.
Finally, those who preferred interaction with the professor and other students were more likely to
choose the traditional format. Other factors such as commuting time or paid employment were
not associated with choice of format.
In the first two columns of Table 6 we present results of a regression of student choice of
format on student characteristics and the five survey questions that showed differences between

18

formats from Table 5 (“learning style is well-suited to a hybrid format,” “traditional lectures
work for me,” “I need structure to get my class work done,” “Prefer quantitative courses to
writing-focused courses,” and “Interaction with professors and other students helps.”) For the
survey questions, we grouped the first two categories (strongly agree and agree) as well as the
last two (disagree and strongly disagree); the latter is the reference category for each of the
survey questions. None of the student characteristics, including those that are strong predictors
of student performance like GPA predict format choice and of the survey questions being
“neutral” about interaction with professors predicts format choice.
In columns (3) and (4) we show results for the effect being in the compressed format in
2014 along with the student characteristics on student performance on the combined midterm
and final, essentially replicating the results from columns (5) and (6) of Table 3.11 GPA, math
ability as measured by the SAT, and the female dummy are all strong predictors of performance.
In columns (5) and (6) of Table 6 we add the four survey questions to examine whether adding
these indicators affect the estimated effect of being in the compressed sections. When we add
these variables, the estimated treatment effect decreases by .033, or roughly 20 percent of the
estimated effect without these variables, and is closer to the experimental estimate of the
treatment effect from 2013. The partial R2 of these variables is .033, meaning that they explain
3.3 percent of the residual variation in the combined midterm and final score once the effects of
the student characteristics have been partialled out. We cannot reject the null hypothesis that the
estimated compressed treatment effect is the same in column (3) and column (5), however.12

11

One student who responded to the survey questions missed the midterm exam for legitimate reasons and therefore
is not included in these performance regressions.
12
To test this hypothesis, we generated 5000 bootstrap samples and with each sample estimated both models. The
correlation between the estimates was .927. Using the bootstrap estimates to calculate the covariance between the
estimates allows us to calculate a standard error for the difference between the two models, which was 0.0256,

IV. Conclusion
We tested whether class time mattered in an Internet-rich environment with both a
randomized and observational design in an effort to simulate a double randomized preference
trial (DRPT). A DRPT extends the value of a randomized study by estimating the effect of
choosing a treatment among subjects who are same as those who were randomly assigned to
treatment. At a minimum, a DRPT offers a test of selection bias by comparing outcomes of the
randomized controls to those who chose the control condition in the choice arm.
We found relatively small differences in the effect of class format on academic
performance between students in the randomized arm and those who chose their format. We also
found little evidence of selection bias in choice of format. One reason may be the nature of the
course. Principles of Microeconomics is a required course of all business school majors and
almost all non-business majors take it as part of their general education requirements. Students
also take the class relatively early in their curriculum because it is a prerequisite for many other
classes, accounting for the balance in student characteristics between the fall of 2013 and 2014.
The lack of selection in choice of format may be related to the limited flexibility students have in
creating a schedule at a commuting college in which many students work. Our survey of
students in the observational study revealed few predictors of choice of format and factors such
as student GPA—a powerful predictor of academic performance—were unrelated to choice of
format.

These features of the course and the balance among student characteristics by design

and format suggest that we may have met the assumptions of a DRPT. If true, our results
suggest that the choice of class format for large required classes is not a major determinant of
student performance.
yielding a z-ratio of 1.29. A non-parametric 95 percent confidence interval for the difference between the two
models also contained zero.

Note: This table reports the average background characteristics of students in randomized field experiment (RFE) in Fall 2013 and contrast them with students who
enrolled to the same course in the Fall 2014. Sample includes students who completed the course. The column “Diff.” shows the difference in means for the indicated
variable. Statistical significance means between 2013 and 2014 tested using two sample t-tests assuming unequal variances. Significance levels are indicated by ∗ < .1,
** < .05 , *** < .01. The column “Norm. Diff”q
shows the normalized differences, and equals the difference in average covariate values, normalized by the standard
deviation of these covariates, i.e. (X̄2003 − X̄2004 )/ s2X,2003 + s2X,2004 . The column “Log Ratio SD” shows the logarithm of the ratio of standard deviations and measures
of dispersion in the distributions of two covariates. The sample analog of this is calculated as the difference in the logarithms of the two sample standard deviations, i.e.
ln(sX,2003 ) − ln(sX,2004 ). The column “N” shows the number of non-missing observations that are used in the comparison.

Note: This table reports the differences between student performance in “compressed” format (lectures once a week) and in “traditional” format (lectures twice a
week) for the Fall 2013 and Fall 2014 semesters. Coefficients are from the estimation of equation (4) in the text which for convenience we show here. Pid f =
α0 + α1Ci f + α2 Did + α3 (Cid × Di f ) + ∑ βk Xikd f + ei f d . The estimate for the “compressed” lecture format relative to the “traditional” lecture format in 2013 is α̂1 + αˆ3 .
All outcomes are based on a standardized normal scale with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1 within each semester. Estimated with OLS. Heteroskedasticityconsistent standard errors in parentheses. Other covariates are Baruch GPA, Transfer, GPA, Verbal SAT, Math SAT, Cumulative Credits, Age, indicator variables
for Part-Time Student, Underclassman, Female, Asian, Black/Hispanic/Other, and Native Speaker plus indicator variables for missing Baruch GPA, Transfer GPA, SAT
scores, Race, and Native English Speaker. Course Grade includes curved midterm and final grades, penalties for missed classes, and the participation bonus. Significance
levels are indicated by ∗ < .1, ** < .05 , *** < .01.

Note: This table reports the differences in pre-class survey responses between the students who chose the “compressed”
format (lectures once per week) and the students who chose the“traditional” format (lectures twice per week) during the
Fall 2014 semester. Figures in column (1) and (2) are the average score for each question. Column (3) reports the survey
question scale. All [1-5] questions used a 5-point Likert scale from 1 to 5 with strongly agree 1, agree 2, neither agree
or disagree 3, disagree 4 and strongly disagree 5. The possible answers to the first question is binary and equals one if
the answer is “yes”. Among the last three questions, the risk preference question has a continuous scale from 1 to 10 and
increases in risk-seeking. The commute question has 4 categories: [1] “less than 30 minutes”, [2] “between 30 minutes and
60 minutes”, [3] “between 60 minutes and 90 minutes” , and [4] “more than 90 minutes”. The last question has 4 categories:
[1] “No paid work” , [2] “Working less than 15 hours per week”, [3] “Working between 15-30 hours per week”, and [4]
“Working more than 30 hours per week”. Column (4) show the p-values from the χ 2 -test of independence among responses
by format. Column 5 reports the number of non-missing observations for the indicated survey question. Significance levels
are indicated by ∗ < .1, ** < .05 , *** < .01..
