Of Time and Space: Technological Spillovers among Patents and Unpatented Innovations
during Early U.S. Industrialization

NBER Working Paper No. 20732
December 2014
JEL No. N11,O31,O33,O34
ABSTRACT
The paper explores the role of institutional mechanisms in generating technological knowledge spillovers.
The estimation is over panel datasets of patent grants, and unpatented innovations that were submitted
for prizes at the annual industrial fairs of the American Institute of New York, during the era of early
industrial expansion. The first section tests the hypothesis of spatial autocorrelation in patenting and
in the exhibited innovations. In keeping with the contract theory of patents, the procedure identifies
high and statistically significant spatial autocorrelation in the sample of inventions that were patented,
indicating the prevalence of geographical spillovers. By contrast, prize innovations were much less
likely to be spatially dependent. The second part of the paper investigates whether unpatented innovations
in a county were affected by patenting in contiguous or adjacent counties, and the analysis indicates
that such spatial effects were large and significant. These results are consistent with the argument
that patents enhance the diffusion of information for both patented and unpatented innovations, whereas
prizes are less effective in generating external benefits from knowledge spillovers. I hypothesize that
the difference partly owes to the design of patent institutions, which explicitly incorporate mechanisms
for systematic recording, access, and dispersion of technical information.

I. INTRODUCTION

Theories of endogenous economic growth highlight the importance of knowledge spillovers in
promoting economic progress within and across countries (Romer 1990, Grossman and Helpman
1991). New information, whether a pure public good or protected by rights of exclusion, can
create benefits for society that are in excess of the private benefits to their producer. Knowledge
spillovers have important implications for the dynamic distribution of income within and across
regions, since the ability to benefit from externalities likely plays a role in the longitudinal
tendency toward convergence and divergence in wealth and standards of living. A question of
some importance is the extent to which knowledge diffuses over time and space. Quah (2001)
argues that economic progress is a function of “weightless” innovations, which defy boundaries
of time and space: once created, these discoveries diffuse rapidly without geographical or
locational limits. In this approach, information becomes the central aspect of technological
change. On the other hand, Keller and Yeaple (2013) attest to the “gravity of weightlessness”
and find that the spatial transmission of knowledge becomes more difficult the greater is the
degree of knowledge intensity. Moreover, the acknowledgement of geographical factors as an
integral part of social and technological patterns has long been emphasized by regional scientists
(Storper 1997).
Thus, there is still a great deal of debate about the nature and sources of the creation and
diffusion of externalities from technological discoveries. Part of this discussion relates to the
function of institutions in enhancing or inhibiting the flow of ideas and technological knowledge.
To date, a great deal of attention has been paid to the role of property rights and institutions in
agriculture, and their relation to informational spillovers. 1 However, little research has been

directed towards a comparative assessment of the effects of different technological institutions,
and how they might influence spillovers from inventive activity. From a static theoretical
perspective, social welfare might be improved by ensuring open access to ideas and inventions,
and today a number of economists support competitive “open markets” in innovation where
inducements are provided by prizes rather than exclusive property rights in patented inventions
(Boldrin and Levine 2008).2 However, if inventors of productive discoveries cannot appropriate
the returns from their efforts, or if innovation markets do not function effectively,
underinvestment in innovation might occur. The common justification for offering patent
protection proposes a bargain or a social contract by means of which inventors obtain a
temporary monopoly in their discoveries, in return for disclosing their ideas in sufficient detail
that the invention can be recreated by someone who is skilled in the arts. By contrast, alternative
methods of appropriation include the use of lead time, private methods of exclusion, and trade
secrecy. Although these mechanisms might benefit the owners of new technologies, at the same
time they could impose a social cost if the information were not available to others despite its
low incremental cost. This is especially true if the legal system provides protection against the
appropriation of trade secrets or reverse engineering. Thus, it is not clear whether unpatented
ideas would tend to promote knowledge spillovers, or to inhibit them.
An extensive literature empirically analyzes the nature and determinants of knowledge
spillovers and the diffusion of information, using a variety of methods, data, and levels of
aggregation (Döring and Schnellenbach 2006). The consensus is that externalities in ideas are to
a large extent bounded by such factors as language and distance, which likely implies that
inventive spillovers are primarily local rather than global (Keller 2002). Jaffe, Trajtenberg, and
2

Boldrin and Levine (“Intellectual property and the scale of the market” (2004), p. 3) also contend that intellectual
property rights tend to offer greater benefits to the wealthy, and that “it would be poor public policy indeed to allow
large monopoly distortions in order to further enrich already wealthy individuals.”

4

Henderson (1993) model a ‘knowledge production function’ and exploit the information
contained in patent citations, and their analysis shows that citations to prior patents were
clustered within metropolitan areas. Other studies confirm the localization of innovative activity,
and argue that this was due to knowledge spillovers rather than to the concentration of
production (Audretsch and Feldman 1996.) Anselin, Varga, and Acs (2000) find significant
spillovers occur between university research and high technology firms, where geographical
spillovers are measured by means of spatial lags. Moreover, earlier surveys suggest that the
extent of patent activity would tend to vary by industry (Levin et al. 1987, Cohen et al. 2000),
and this leads to the implication that both knowledge intensity and spillovers would also differ
across industries. One concludes from the welter of contemporary studies that technological
inputs and outputs are clustered, but the reasons for these patterns are still not entirely clear. It is
also not known how much of these results are specific to design of the particular research
reported in these papers, including the time period, location, or the measure of knowledge used
(R&D, patents, patent citations, scientific papers and publications.)
An historical perspective allows us to better understand the nature and sources of
variation in externalities over time, geographical location and technological proximity. For
instance, if spillovers occured in the technologies of the first and second industrial revolutions,
then they are less likely to be a function of time and specific technologies. Over the course of
the nineteenth century there was more heterogeneity in access to markets, as well as the nature of
technological innovations. In a pioneering study, Sokoloff (1988) showed that the expansion of
transportation networks that eased access to markets promoted inventive activity in the
antebellum period, especially in rural locales. Among the great inventors in the United States,
the majority migrated across regions and countries, and tended to cluster in areas with expanding

5

markets (Khan and Sokoloff 2004). In this, and other respects, technologically and economically
important contributions exhibited similar patterns to those of less eminent inventors. Lamoreaux
and Sokoloff (2001) traced changes in the industrial and geographical location of inventive
activity and transactions in the market for patent rights that flourished during the Second
Industrial Revolution.
As such geography has always played a role in the historical approach to technological
change, and more recent studies consider the spatial dimension of innovation, and the external
effects from technological creativity in the United States. Lo and Sutthiphisal (2010), who
analyze the geography of “crossover inventions,” downplay the role of knowledge spillovers
across industries, and instead suggest that human capital and institutional factors were more
important in generating innovations. By contrast, Moser (2011) considers chemical innovations
that were exhibited at four world fairs between 1851 and 1915. Her results are based on a
Herfindahl index approach to geographical concentration, and suggest that increases in patenting
rates were associated with a lower degree of geographical localization among innovations in the
chemical industry. After the publication of the periodic table, it was easier for firms to reverse
engineer chemically-based discoveries, and patent around them, which facilitated the diffusion of
knowledge.3
The early industrial period in the United States amounted to an “age of patented
inventions” where inventors who devised patentable inventions were quick to secure patent
protection (Khan 2005). Unpatented innovations that were exhibited at annual fairs in
Massachusetts primarily comprised contributions that might have aided commercialization, but

(2006).

were not eligible for patent protection (Khan 2011).4 The objective of the current paper is to
further our understanding of the role of institutions in innovation, by comparing the patterns of
patents, relative to those of innovations that were outside the patent system. The analysis
estimates the degree of spatial heterogeneity as a measure of knowledge spillovers. The
estimation is over a panel data set of some 11,000 observations, comprising a sample of patented
inventions, as well as unpatented innovations that were exhibited at annual industrial fairs in
New York between 1835 and 1870.
In short, this study investigates spatial heterogeneity in prizes and patented innovations
and examines the implications of spatial factors for understanding the nature and sources of
inventive activity.5 The next section discusses patents and innovations at the fairs of the
American Institute of New York. The third section presents descriptive statistics regarding the
characteristics of the patentees, exhibitors and innovations, including the patterns of inventive
activity across industrial and sectoral categories. The fourth section discusses the empirical
strategy and tests for spatial autocorrelation. The fifth section conducts multivariate spatial
regressions, which take into account the effects of geographical proximity between regions that
conduct patenting activity and those that innovate. The final section offers a discussion of the
results and concludes.

II. PATENTS, PRIZES AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION
During the past two centuries technological change has made a significant contribution to
advances in human welfare. However, it is difficult to make accurate estimates of the sources of
4

These data do not support Boldrin and Levine’s untested assertions. Instead, I find that wealthier individuals
tended to win prizes, whereas less distinguished inventors benefited from patent protection.
5
Spatial econometrics analyzes spatial and geographical effects linking adjacent observations (Anselin (1988). This
approach is especially useful for examining knowledge spillovers. For instance, Anselin, Varga, and Acs (1997)
employed such techniques to examine the effects of investments in research and development on the metropolitan
distribution of innovation.

7

such progress, in part because of the paucity of objective measures of inventive activity and
innovation that are comparable across time and region. To date, the most extensive empirical
studies of the economic history of technological change have relied on patents to gauge progress
in the ‘useful arts’. Nevertheless, patents have well-known problems as measures of inventive
activity (Griliches 1990). Most significantly, some inventions are not patentable, not all
inventors apply for patents, and not all patent applications are granted, the propensity to patent
differs across industries and individuals, and patented inventions vary in terms of value.
Moser (2005) examined the exhibits at the international Crystal Palace Exhibition of
1851 as a way of assessing invention outside the patent system. She argued that only a small
fraction of these inventions were covered by patents at the time they were exhibited. This result
is interesting and important, but it is difficult to extrapolate from such data to make general
statements about the propensity to patent, or even about the relative degree of inventiveness in
any specific country. For instance, a large number of items at such exhibitions were inherently
unpatentable; they were often exhibited by the seller, not by the creator of the invention, offering
poor matches to the patent records; and, unlike patents, it is impossible to attach a date to their
creation, making meaningful estimations of propensities to patent unfeasible. 6 Brunt et al.
(2012) conducted an empirical analysis of prizes at the Royal Agricultural Society of England,
and concluded that these mechanisms proved to be effective in inducing competitive entry into
targeted areas, and in encouraging innovation. Prefectures in Meiji Japan also offered large
numbers of prizes, and Nicholas (2012) argues that these prizes not only increased patenting,
they also created large spillovers of technical knowledge. These studies are timely because
6

International exhibitions are unlikely to be representative of the inventive capital in individual countries, since the
selection of items introduces biases that are uncorrelated with technological capability. For instance, the size and
content of the exhibition for any country were determined by distance and political expedience rather than by
random draws from the underlying population of inventions in the nation. Moreover, without a time-limited test of
novelty, exhibits comprised a stock rather than a flow measure, which increases the difficulty of comparisons across
institutions.

8

scepticism has increased of late about whether state grants of property rights in patents and
copyright protection comprise the most effective incentives for increasing creativity. Such
theoretical arguments cannot be fairly evaluated in light of the limited amount of actual evidence
regarding the functioning and consequences of prize systems.
The present paper contributes to this ongoing debate by analyzing the record of patenting
and prizes for technological innovation in the United States from an historical perspective. I
have assembled a panel data set of innovations and inventors that competed for annual prizes in
the United States during the course of the nineteenth century. These entries were submitted for
prizes in the fairs of the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association of Boston, the
Mechanics’ Institute of San Francisco, the American Institute of New York, the Ohio
Mechanics’ Institute, as well as the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia.7 The samples of
approximately 17,000 innovations have been matched in the federal manuscript censuses of the
United States to obtain information on characteristics of the inventors, including wealth and
occupations. The inventions and inventors were further traced in patent records, so it is possible
to identify key features of technological innovation within and beyond the patent system, and to
gauge the extent to which patent institutions overlapped with other incentive mechanisms, and
their relative determinants and outcomes.
The current paper presents results from a sample drawn from the exhibits at the industrial
fairs of the American Institute of New York.

The American Institute of the City of New York

was founded in 1828, with the objective of "encouraging and promoting domestic industry in this
7

Previous research (Khan 2013, 2014) was based on the data from the Massachusetts Institute of Mechanics. I
estimated the factors that influenced the award of premiums for specific inventions, and compared these findings to
the determinants of patented inventions and those that were patentable. The analysis suggested that the process
through which prizes are awarded is more idiosyncratic than is true of patent institutions, which has implications for
their efficacy. Prize winners tended to belong to more privileged classes than the general population of patentees,
as gauged by the wealth and occupations of inventors at the exhibition. Moreover, the award of prizes was
unrelated to such proxies for the productivity of the innovation as inventive capital or the commercial success of the
invention.

State, and the United States, in Agriculture, Commerce, Manufacturing and the Arts, and any
improvements made therein, by bestowing rewards and other benefits on those who shall make
such improvements, or excel in any of the said branches."8 The organization also represented the
interests of inventors in political arenas, lobbying for tariff protection, patent reforms, and related
policies of interest. Between 1828 and 1897 the Institute offered inducements for manufacturing
enterprise in the form of annual fairs which initially attracted entrants from New York and the
surrounding Mid-Atlantic region, but soon exhibits originated also from more distant states.9
Exhibits were judged by special committees, who awarded premiums in the form of cash,
certificates, and medals. Recipients could opt for the cash value of an award, but these gold and
silver medals were greatly valued by their winners as a means of promoting and commercializing
their innovations. As such, participants had an inducement to engage in expenditures in excess
of the expected reward.
Industrial fairs may have had the stated objective of promoting inventive activity and
innovation, but their organizers were well aware of the potential trade-offs that existed with their
joint objective of attracting attendance and participation by firms. Exhibitions that were popular
among the general public would prove to be profitable for the Institute and, similarly, exhibitors
would make the investments to attend, the greater the likelihood of receiving accolades for their
products, and the more numerous the viewers of their displays. At the annual fair of 1850, 2587

The Institute itself was still in operation until the 1980s. The four standing committees that considered innovations
included the Committee on Manufactures, Arts and Sciences, the Committee on Commerce, and the Committee on
Agriculture. The classes of exhibits at the annual fairs comprised fine arts and education, dwellings, dress and
handicraft, chemistry and mineralogy, engines and machinery, intercommunication, and agriculture and horticulture.
Highly successful during much of the nineteenth century, the Institute’s 1897 Annual Report conceded that "the era
of the fair as an advertising medium, as well as a popular resort, must be recorded as an amusement and business
venture of the past." It is probably not coincidental that the decline of industrial fairs and competition for prizes
coincided with the advent of the age of professional advertising for mass markets. Subsequent fairs were primarily
organized to showcase floral and agricultural exhibits.

10

items were exhibited, largely in the category of manufacturing, and the organizers distributed
some $3,000 worth of medals, cups, prize books and cash as awards. The Finance Committee
reported earnings of $18,770 with $11,345 in expenditures. During the fair, a number of learned
addresses were given, including a lecture on the patent laws which was delivered by George
Gifford, a patent lawyer who had represented the Singer Sewing Machine Company. Two
decades later, the exhibition of 1870 included 1670 articles on display and the available space
spread over 100,000 square feet. Among the invited speakers were Horace Greeley (President of
the Institute at that time) and Benjamin Silliman, the celebrated Yale chemist. Approximately
600,000 visitors attended the fair, generating revenues of approximately $72,000, along with
expenditures of $51,000. Some 140 judges deliberated before awarding $1213 in premiums,
although they decided that none of the exhibits in that year was worthy of the celebrated Grand
Medal of Honor.10
The Reports of the Institute included an account of all the exhibits that were entered in
competition for prizes in that year. They offered information that mentioned the name of the
exhibitor (often the agent of a manufacturing or commercial enterprise), the city and state of
residence, a description of the invention, and the type of prize allocated if the invention was
indeed granted an award. In some instances, the names of the committee of judges were
reported. Some of the committees mentioned the reasons for their decisions, such as the degree
of novelty in the exhibit (a patentable characteristic), or their admiration of the attractiveness and
superior workmanship associated with the item (unpatentable characteristics).11 These records
10

These details are taken from the Annual Reports of the American Institute for the relevant years.
At the Crystal Palace Exhibition and other such events, the criteria for awards were similarly quite variable.
Three types of awards were given: Council medals, prize medals, and honourable mentions. The Council medals
rewarded novelty, but were also given for other reasons, such as beauty and cheapness of the good. The criteria for
the other prize medals and honourable mentions did not include novelty. See REPORTS BY THE JURIES, supra note 79,
at xxiv. Instead, juries were instructed to give prizes for criteria that had little or nothing to do with technological
inventiveness or patentability, such as beauty of design and appearance, “[a]daptability to use, economy in first cost,
11

11

on the exhibits were matched to patent documents, and to the manuscript censuses to acquire
further data on the invention and inventor.12
Thus, at the 1852 exhibition, Gardner Chilson (1804-1877) of Boston, Massachusetts
displayed a portable hot air furnace. The patent records reveal that Chilson was a multiple
patentee in the United States, England and France, who had received a patent for a portable hot
air furnace two years previously. Like many patentees, he was a migrant, who had been born in
Connecticut, and worked as an apprentice in pattern and cabinet making in Sterling, CT. Chilson
later moved to Providence, and in 1837 made his permanent home in Boston. In 1850 his
occupation was listed as a trader, and he did not report any wealth. However, his foundry in
Mansfield, MA which produced the items he invented as well as those of other patentees, was so
successful that he bequeathed an estate that was valued in excess of $300,000.

III. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS FOR THE SAMPLE
The objective of the paper is to compare the patterns from federal patents to the items that
received technological prizes, as a gauge of innovations outside the patent system. The panel
data set comprises two random samples that were drawn from patent data (6500 observations),
and innovations that were collected from the annual exhibitions at the American Institute of New
York (5700 observations). Patent rights are filtered through an examination process that screens
for novelty, whereas access for exhibitors was for the most part unrestricted, although the fairs
excluded itinerant peddlers and hawkers from the standing exhibits. Although a few of the great
inventors such as Cyrus McCormick, Richard Gatling and Charles Goodyear displayed their
durability, economy of maintenance, excellency [sic] of workmanship, strength.” See 1 REPORTS OF THE
COMMISSIONERS OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION HELD AT VIENNA 39 (Robert H.
Thurston ed., 1876) (discussing the Crystal Palace).
12
Since many of the exhibitors at any industrial fair (whether local or international) were firms and commercializers,
such matches cannot be viewed as an accurate estimate of the percentage of displayed items that were patented.

12

inventions at the fairs, the majority of the exhibitors comprised less eminent inventors. It is
interesting to note that, whereas some observers have suggested that the patent system was (and
is) biased against women inventors because few have obtained patent protection, inventions by
women were even scarcer at this series of exhibitions. Women did feature prominently in areas
such as sewing and paintings, but only 31 appear in the roster of innovations. Thus, the
evidence suggests that reasons for their relatively low formal inventive creativity owed to factors
beyond the nature of technological institutions.
Industries differ in terms of their technological inputs and intensity, and their capacity for
effective trade secrecy or for generating spillovers also vary. For instance, in the absence of
distinct measures for transmitting information, manufacturing machinery and processes are less
likely to diffuse than innovations in transportation or pharmaceuticals. Table 1 shows that
exhibits primarily comprised manufactured final products such as guns, watches and rubber
goods. The second column denotes whether the exhibit fell under the subject matter that was
patentable (note that this is a very minimal criterion, since patentability further required
substantive novelty, which cannot be determined from any exhibition data.) The exhibits varied
significantly in terms of their patentable subject matter, ranging from over ninety percent of heat
and power innovations, to below a quarter in the furniture industry.
Discussions of such exhibits often speculate about the propensity to patent. However,
this concept is subject to significant error, since over 35 percent of the exhibits belonged to firms
which (according to U.S. patent law) cannot obtain patents in their own name, and other items
were likewise submitted by individuals who were not the original inventors. Hence, it is
impossible to systematically trace whether all exhibitors have patents on the innovations they

13

displayed.13 Moreover, many of the names of the exhibitors at all such events include only
initials and surname, making it difficult to assign a match. Unless this is taken into account and
the denominator is adjusted, the calculations of the propensity to patent will be biased
downwards. Of the total 3100 innovations that were credited to individuals, 524 were traced in
the patent records, suggesting that a lower bound of 16 percent of exhibits were patented. Since
1521 of exhibits were patentable, about a third of innovations that fell within the patentable
subject matter were actually patented. However, it is impossible to determine novelty, which
comprises the primary qualification of the patent grant, so this determination does not necessarily
imply that the owners of unpatented innovations were rejecting patents in favour of alternative
mechanisms such as secrecy.
Table 1 also includes the distribution of medals by industrial category. If medals were
awarded based on technological contributions, we would expect that the proportions would vary
by industry. But, similar to the findings for the other regional and international exhibitions,
medals seem to have been allotted on a fixed ratio, with a quota allocated to each type of
industrial class, rather than on the basis of overall productivity. It is noticeable that the most
evident deviation from this finding is in the category for the arts, such as musical instruments
and the printing of elaborate blank books. This is consistent with the exhibition reports, which
frequently praised items for their visual attractiveness or workmanship, and to a lesser extent for
such criteria as novelty or technological improvements that lead to patents being granted.
Table 2 describes the characteristics of the data in terms of their industrial and
geographical distributions. The exhibits and patents are fairly similar in sectoral coverage, apart
from the lower percentage of agricultural innovations being shown at the fairs of the Institute.
13

Firms appear in patent records when the invention has been formally assigned at issue to them by the patentee.
For extensive studies of assignment records at issue and after issue, see the series of papers by Lamoreaux and
Sokoloff.

14

Specific types of technologies, such as engines and manufacturing machinery, featured in the
patent records as well as at the exhibitions. However, in keeping with the likely objective of the
exhibition, more manufacturing firms and their products are included in these data, than among
the patents sampled. Thus, patents were more representative of the entire population of new
technologies, whereas the exhibitions showcased the population of innovations or
commercialized items, and an examination of the records of the exhibits suggests that they
incorporated lower inventive inputs on average.14
As one might expect, the patent data are more broadly distributed across regions. The
annual exhibitions of the American Institute were located in New York and, although innovators
from surrounding regions were quick to take advantage of the opportunity to display their
products, the representation of the majority of exhibitors does not extend beyond the MidAtlantic and New England. The New York exhibits fail to track the increasing importance of the
Midwest and West in technological innovation. However, in this early period the limited
regional coverage is not significant for our purposes. First, the Mid-Atlantic and New England
regions were the locus of the majority of patents filed in this early period, accounting for twothirds of all patents. Second, the effective geographic range of knowledge spillovers would
likely be fairly restricted before the 1880s, due to the substantial information costs and other
transactions costs that prevailed before the spread of low-cost, high-speed transportation and
communications. Moreover, the emphasis here is on the relative performance of patent
institutions and prize systems.
Patents and prize-winning innovations differed in many regards, including in terms of the
role of geography and location. The regressions in Table 3 estimate likely determinants of
inventive activity and innovation among exhibits. Similar analyses of patents in New York and
14

In the rest of this paper, the terms exhibits, prizes and innovations are used interchangeably.

15

the other regions in the United States can explain two thirds of the variation in patenting rates,
suggesting that inventive activity that is protected by intellectual property rights is somewhat
systematic. By way of contrast, the results here replicate those for the Massachusetts
exhibitions, which indicate that the noise to signal ratio is high, since the award of medals
consists of largely unexplained variation. The grant of gold medals is almost totally random, so
the regressions instead attempt to determine the factors that influence both gold and silver
awards. Firms were more likely to win the better class of medals, especially if they filed exhibits
that fell under patentable subject matter. However, inventors who had larger numbers of patents
did not glean any special advantage for their exhibits, even if their invention was valued in the
marketplace and assigned to another buyer. The second regression adds location and spatial
factors in the form of dummy variables for cities and estimates of longitude and latitude, but
these add virtually nothing to the explanatory power of the estimated model. Similarly,
machinists and engineers, who typically possessed the highest amount of specialized knowledge
and inventive human capital, did not achieve any advantage in the market for prizes.
Thus, this preliminary discussion leads to the hypothesis that prize exhibits did not reflect
the sort of technological creativity that could expand productive frontiers through spillovers. It
is possible that this is due to the prevalence of final goods that tended to enhance taste and
consumption possibilities, rather than the promotion of inventive activity. The preliminary
regressions in Table 3 suggest the need for further analysis to determine whether patents and
prizes differed in other dimensions. If prizes were less systematic, and had a lower likelihood of
being associated with location and geography, then such awards would fail the necessary
precondition for the prevalence of geographical and technological spillovers. The next section

16

therefore specifically addresses this issue, and tests for spatial heterogeneity in patents and
exhibits.

IV. EMPIRICAL SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION ANALYSIS

The empirical analysis is directed towards determining whether patents and unpatented
innovations differed in their spatial dependence. The first question to determine is the relevant
unit of analysis. Many spatial studies of the modern period examine geographical links at a
fairly high level of aggregation, including countries and states. However, we might expect that
spillovers, productivity and output in the nineteenth century would effectively be a function of
more disaggregated units, so the data here are assessed at the county level.15 Second, it is
necessary to identify the specific connotation of “spatial proximity.” We employ two different
measures of geographic adjacency. It is generally agreed that influence is inversely related to
distance, and we measure distance from other counties using specific locations described in
degrees of latitudes and longitudes. This distance instrument does not incorporate transactions
costs, nor does it include such barriers as inhospitable topography or facilitating factors such as
major transportation networks. The second distance variable uses a contiguous counties
approach that calculates the effects of patenting or innovations in counties that share a common
border (“queen contiguity”) with the county in question. According to the gravity model of
technological knowledge, mechanisms that generate spillovers depend on spatial proximity,
which is precisely defined in terms of a spatial matrix with dimensions (N x N), where N=1788
counties.

15

In other work, the analysis has been extended to include exhibitions in other states, and explores how sensitive the results are
to other alternative definitions of distance.

Spatial autocorrelation exists when the values of a variable comprise a function of its
location and spatial characteristics that are defined in terms of a specific measure of distance. If
spatial autocorrelation is high, this is a result that is interesting in itself; but it also has
implications for the validity of conventional procedures, since the usual method of merely adding
fixed effects for regions or states leads to unobserved heterogeneity that will likely lead to biased
results. Moran’s I statistic allows us to test for the existence of global spatial autocorrelation
(Moran 1950).16 The null hypothesis of zero spatial autocorrelation implies that the variable in
question is a spatially independent and identically distributed draw from a standard normal
distribution.
Moran’s I statistic can be computed as

I 

The analysis here employs a weight matrix that is based on distance, where the distance between
county i and county j is measured from centered values of longitude and latitudes. Any offdiagonal entry in the matrix represents the inverse of the distance between point i and point j.
Moran’s I ranges from -1 to 1, and has an expected value of -1/(n-1), which tends to zero as n
increases. Thus, a value that exceeds zero indicates positive spatial autocorrelation (similar

values are closely located), and a value than is less than zero implies negative autocorrelation
(dissimilar values are closely located). The Z statistic normalizes the value and provides a
standard t-test for statistical significance.
Table 4 presents the results of testing the hypothesis of spatial correlation among the
patents per capita at the county level. The results for total patents are highly significant, with a Z
statistic of 14.3, implying that we can reject the null hypothesis of zero spatial autocorrelation in
inventions that were patented. Per capita patenting over this period was affected by strong
spatial localization, implying the existence of geographical spillover effects. In particular, New
England and the entrants into technological markets in the West and Midwest experienced high
benefits from contiguous counties that were innovators. This may be due to the smaller
geographical area of the New England region, and to the abundance of modes of transportation
over water and land, that prevailed even in the early years of settlement of these counties. It is
noticeable that in the postbellum period the degree of spatial autocorrelation falls somewhat in
other areas (even becoming indistinguishable from zero in the Mid-Atlantic), but experiences a
moderate increase in the frontier regions. As followers or late-comers, the frontier areas were
likely beneficiaries from the investments that the Northeast had made in technological inputs.
The evidence in Table 5 relates to the data from the American Institute exhibitions for the
innovations that were unpatented, and here the conclusions are more mixed. The Z coefficient
for the overall sample of the exhibitions data is only marginally significant. There is significant
variation in the different regions in the existence of spatial dependence. The region of interest
here is New York, which was the place of residences for most of the innovators. However, it is
striking that in each level of the table we cannot reject the null hypothesis for New York.
Unpatented innovations in New York were not spatially autocorrelated, which implies that such

19

innovations did not generate much in the way of geographical spillovers. The Moran value is
statistically significant in New England and the Mid-Atlantic, but it is possible that these effects
were due not to innovations but to unobserved heterogeneity such as the high patenting rates that
prevailed in these areas.

V. ESTIMATION OF TECHNOLOGICAL SPILLOVERS

The spatial autocorrelation analysis revealed that patents were significantly influenced by the
inventive activity in adjacent counties. This is consistent with the bargain or contract view of
patents, which proposes that the limited grant of a monopoly right to inventors benefits society,
because in exchange the public gains information about the discovery that increases social
welfare. The patent grant requires a specification that is sufficiently detailed to enable a person
who is skilled in the arts to recreate the patented invention. From the earliest years of the patent
system, policy makers engaged in discussions about how to ensure that information was
available to the broader public. Patent legislation included measures to publish information
about patents that were granted in annual reports that were widely disseminated, and expired
patents were published in newspapers. The U.S. Patent Office maintained local depositories and
offices throughout the country. Thus, even if the patentee had acquired a monopoly for (at that
time) fourteen to seventeen years, access to the information about the discovery likely facilitated
inventions that worked around the initial patent, or led to ideas for follow-on inventions.
Thus, the evidence here supports the notion that trade secrecy or even open access to
ideas did not generate as much diffusion as in the case of inventions that were protected by
20

patent grants. Exhibits at the American Institute might have been open to the public, and some
inventors might have been able to copy from the displays, but there was likely a selection effect
that influenced the owners of inventions that were readily duplicable not to display them at fairs.
Moreover, even if inventors had access to knowledge about innovations from attending the fairs,
there were few or no mechanisms that might have led to the spread of information beyond
physical attendance. This was of course a function of the decentralized nature of the prize
system in the United States, but even in European countries that offered centralized institutions
such as the Royal Society of Arts, access to unpatented inventions and knowledge about them
was quite limited.
Unpatented innovations may not have led to significant spillovers, but another question is
the extent to which patents were associated with rates of innovation and commercialization. We
will now address this question by estimating the impact of geographical clustering of patents in
counties adjacent to the county of residence for the innovator or owner of the exhibit. The
analysis takes advantage of spatial econometric techniques developed by Anselin (1988) to
model spatial lags. The estimation is over per capita innovations at the county level.
In particular, we estimate the following equation:
Per Capita Innovations (P) = ρWΛ +Xβ + ε
Where ρ is a spatial lag parameter
W is a weights matrix, which designates counties as neigbours if they are
contiguous
Λ is a vector of per capita patents
X is a matrix of other exogenous variables
ε is vector of error terms

21

The dependent variable is the log of per capita innovations at the county level. The first term on
the right hand side comprises the product of the weights matrix and the vector Λ of per capita
patents at the county level. It therefore represents the spatial lag of patents for the innovations in
a county, or a weighted measure of patents in all of the counties adjoining a given county (queen
contiguity). We report the OLS regressions here, but similar results were obtained using
negative binomial specifications of the innovations expressed as count data. In this paper we
control just for geographical proximity, but later work will include the technological and
industrial composition of the counties as additional determinants of potential spillovers (Jaffe,
Tratjenberg and Henderson 1993).
The results of these spatial regressions are reported in Table 6. As in my studies of other
U.S. exhibitions and European data, the previous section reported that exhibits of the New York
Institute were more heterogeneous than patents, and the award of prizes was quite random and
unsystematic, so regressions had low explanatory power. The inclusion of spatial effects here
increases our ability to explain variation in such innovations, and in all specifications the spatial
lag parameter is statistically significant. In general, a one percent increase in patenting activity
in neighbouring counties would tend to increase the amount of innovations per capita in a county
by as much as 0.29 percent. One might speculate that such an impact owed to the possible
influence of manufacturing, available capital funding, or to urban amenities. However, inclusion
of proxies for these variables (manufacturing labour force and urbanization) does not materially
alter the effect of contiguous inventions. Other locational factors such as regions are only
marginally significant. Following other authors, the analysis also tests the impact of location in
terms of latitude and longitude on the dependent variable. It is interesting to observe that
distance has an effect through latitude, but not in terms of longitude. One potential reason might

22

be the effect of the Erie Canal, and it would be possible to test this hypothesis in future work,
with dummy variables for the counties that adjoined the canal.

VI. CONCLUSION
In recent decades, economists have begun to pay more attention to the role of geography and
distance in enhancing and inhibiting technological change. There is a plethora of evidence to
attest to the existence of significant spatial externalities, at least for the modern period. Yet,
according to Audretsch and Feldman (1996), “The literature identifying mechanisms actually
transmitting knowledge spillovers is sparse and remains underdeveloped,” a statement which
remains true today. By comparing patents and unpatented innovations which were entered in
competition for prizes, we can gain some insight into the institutional mechanisms that influence
technological externalities. Today, many economists have become disenchanted with patents as
a policy to promote technological and economic progress, and have lobbied for prizes as a
substitute. Their focus is on the deadweight loss that monopolies engender, which is absent in
the case of prizes. However, this literature has largely ignored other facets of the trade-off
between patents and prizes, including the role of inventive spillovers.
The analysis of technological spillovers in this paper was based on spatial econometric
measures that are commonly used in economic geography to measure externalities that are a
function of distance and spatial distribution. The first section tested the hypothesis of spatial
autocorrelation in patenting and in the innovations that were exhibited at the annual fairs of the
American Institute of New York. In keeping with the contract theory of patents, the procedure
identified high and statistically significant spatial autocorrelation, indicating the prevalence of
geographical spillovers in the sample of inventions that were patented. At the same time, prize
23

innovations were much less likely to be spatially dependent, especially in the key area of New
York. These results are consistent with the argument that inventions that garner prizes and
commercial innovations are less effective in generating external benefits from knowledge
spillovers.
The second part of the paper was directed toward the estimation of a spatial lag
coefficient, in order to determine whether per capita innovations/prizes in a county were affected
by patenting in contiguous or adjacent counties. The regressions showed that such spatial effects
were large and significant. In short, the results from the spatial econometric analysis of this
paper suggest that patents provided significant positive externalities, not just for other inventors,
but also for innovators or commercializers. By way of contrast, prizes may have offered private
benefits to the competitors involved, but were less likely to create externalities that enhance
social welfare.
In future work, I plan to consider the effects of technological proximity, which might be
expected to influence clustering of inventions. Another question that is more difficult to answer
is the extent to which technological and geographical spillovers are driven by the quality of an
invention. In the modern period, patent citations are available as a measure of quality, and
numerous studies have shown that spillovers are association with cited patents (Jaffe,
Tratjenberg and Henderson 1993). However, patent citations were not included in nineteenth
century records, so one has to be somewhat more innovative in constructing proxies for quality.
The first approach is to proxy high-valued inventions by those that are filed by great inventors,
following Khan and Sokoloff (2004) who argue that the portfolio of patents by great inventors
are of greater average economic and technical value, than those of ordinary inventors. The

24

second method of measuring the role of important inventions is to consider those innovations
that were granted gold or silver medals at exhibitions.
In sum, the results in this study of patents and prizes are consistent with an extensive
examination of the record for various locations in the United States, France and Britain.
Together, they suggest that a great benefit of patent systems comprised their market-orientation,
whereby values were determined through external prices and that, even in the absence of
corruption or personal bias, administrative attempts to replicate the role of the market confronted
significant obstacles.17 Further, the evidence from the spatial analysis are consistent with the
argument that patents enhanced the diffusion of information for both patented and unpatented
innovations, whereas prizes were less effective in generating external benefits from knowledge
spillovers. We may hypothesize that the difference partly owes to the design of patent
institutions, which explicitly incorporate mechanisms for systematic recording, access, and
dispersion of technical information. The Founders of American industrial institutions may
therefore have been prescient in their decisions regarding the appropriate role of patents and
prizes in promoting the progress of science and useful arts during early industrialization.

17

Judges had to combine technical competence and industry-specific knowledge with impartiality; decision-making
among panels was complicated by differences in standards, interpretation, sometimes language barriers. The
necessary tests of the items displayed was complicated by lack of comparability, poor information on marketability
and price, and variations in taste. The most novel items were associated with the greatest risk, and therefore less
likely to be selected. Such difficulties tended to lead to haphazard decisions, or were often overcome by simply
making the award to the person or firm with the most established reputation, or those who had spent the most to
secure the prize.
