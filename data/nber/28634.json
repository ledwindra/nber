    "abstract": "\n\nWe examine the effect of school shootings on health and human capital outcomes of exposed students as adults and on their migration during high school and a few years beyond. The analytic dataset use shootings compiled by the Center for Homeland Defense and Security with 2003-2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data. To study migration, we use the 2004-2018 American Community Survey. We find that students exposed to school shootings experience declines in health and well-being, engage in more risky behaviors, and have worse education and labor market outcomes as young adults. There is no evidence of migration in response to school shootings.\n\n",
