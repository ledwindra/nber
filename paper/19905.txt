Collaborating With People Like Me: Ethnic co-authorship within the US

NBER Working Paper No. 19905

JEL No. J01,J1,J15
ABSTRACT
This study examines the ethnic identity of authors in over 2.5 million scientific papers written by US-based
authors from 1985 to 2008, a period in which the frequency of English and European names among
authors fell relative to the frequency of names from China and other developing countries. We find
that persons of similar ethnicity co-author together more frequently than predicted by their proportion
among authors. Using a measure of homophily for individual papers, we find that greater homophily
is associated with publication in lower impact journals and with fewer citations, even holding fixed
the authors' previous publishing performance. By contrast, papers with authors in more locations and
with longer reference lists get published in higher impact journals and receive more citations than
others. These findings suggest that diversity in inputs by author ethnicity, location, and references
leads to greater contributions to science as measured by impact factors and citations.

The globalization of science has changed the ethnic and national origin of US-based scientists
and engineers (Freeman 2006). From the mid-1970s to the 2000s the foreign-born proportion of
science and engineering PhDs granted by US universities roughly doubled, increasing the supply of
foreign-born persons to US-based science as research assistants during their PhD studies and as postdoctoral workers afterward (Bound et al. 2009; Franzoni et al. 2012; Stephan 2012).1 Expansion of
doctorate science and engineering education worldwide increased the supply of potential non-US
educated immigrant scientists and engineers to US-based science as well (Borjas and Doran 2013).2
These developments substantially changed the ethnic composition of the scientists and
engineers who produce scientific papers in the US. In 1985 about 57% of authors on papers in the
Web of Science (WoS) with US addresses had “English” names, 13% had European names while
30% had names of other ethnic groups.3 The proportion of authors with English names dropped
below 50% in 1994 and continued falling to 46% in 2008. By contrast, the proportion of Chinese
named authors increased substantially, as did the proportion of authors with names associated with
Indian, Hispanic/ Filipino, Russian, and Korean ethnicity. In 2008 14% of the names on papers
written in the US had Chinese names and 8% had Indian/Hindi/South Asian names.
Given the increasingly collaborative nature of science (Wuchty et al. 2007), it is natural to
ask whether newly emergent groups of primarily foreign-born researchers work disproportionately
with persons of their ethnicity, producing homophily in co-authorship similar to that found in many
other areas of human and animal behavior4; and whether homophily in collaborations is associated

Homophily refers to the “birds of a feather flock together” pattern in which people of similar backgrounds congregate

with more or less valuable scientific work.
To determine the extent of homophily in scientific collaborations, we use names to identify
the ethnic identify of the co-authors of 2.57 million papers with US addresses in the ThomsonReuters Web of Science data base. To assess the scientific contribution of papers with differing
ethnic composition, we examine the impact factors of the journals in which the papers appear and the
numbers of forward citations to the paper.

Despite extensive studies of co-authorship patterns

among scientists (Barabasi et al 2002; Newman 2001a, 2001b, Jones et al. 2008), to our knowledge
this is the first study of homophily in scientific collaborations. We find:
1.Substantial homophily among research teams, with co-authors more likely to be of the same
ethnicity than would occur by chance given the ethnic distribution of all authors of scientific papers
or of authors in the specific discipline in which the paper fits.
2.Homophily is associated with publication in a lower impact factor journal and with fewer
citations of papers.
3. Researchers with weaker previous publications records are especially likely to write papers
with persons of the same ethnicity, but this accounts for only part of the reduced impact factor and
citations associated with higher homophily among co-authors.
Section one documents the existence of homophily in the ethnic composition of co-authorship
for US-based papers and develops an Homophily Index at the level of papers for ensuing analysis.
Section two estimates the relation between the Homophily Index of a paper and the impact factor of
the journal of publication and numbers of future citations, conditional on other characteristics of
papers and authors.

Section three examines the previous publication record of researchers who are

more/less likely to write papers like themselves and examines whether the previous publication

together. Such behavior is found throughout social life: marriage, residence, business partnerships, seating arrangements,
and so on (McPherson et al. 2001).

Hegde and Tumlinson (2011) analyze the potential payoff from homophily.

record accounts for the negative relation between homophily and impact factors and citations.

We

conclude by placing the estimated effect of homophily on impact factors and citations in the context
of the other factors associated with those outcomes of scientific work.

1. Ethnic composition of US-based authors and homophily of research teams
To measure the ethnic composition of US-based researchers, we undertook a two-step
procedure. First, using the Thomson-Reuters Web of Science5 database from 1985 to 2008, we
created a file of papers in which all authors had US addresses. We limited the sample to US-based
authors so that authors could meet at seminars, conferences, or other scientific events in the country
and thus potentially form a collaborative project. Limiting the sample to papers written solely in the
US allows us to construct a probabilistic model of the distribution of ethnic co-authorship absent
homophily that would be difficult to develop for foreign collaborations.
Second, using William Kerr's name-ethnicity matching program, we assigned an ethnic
identity to authors. Kerr's program combines information on the distribution of names by ethnicity
and the metropolitan statistical areas in which individuals live to determine their likely ethnicity
(Kerr 2008, Kerr and Lincoln 2010). The identification hinges on the fact that last names such as
Kim are especially likely to represent Koreans while names like Zhang are likely to be Chinese, and
so on. Because persons of a particular ethnicity live disproportionately in some areas, area
information helps distinguish ethnicity as well. We divide ethnicity into nine categories: Chinese
(CHN), Anglo-Saxon/English (ENG), European (EUR), Indian/Hindi/South Asian (HIN),
Hispanic/Filipino (HIS), Japanese (JAP), Korean (KOR), Russian (RUS) and Vietnamese (VNM).

The WOS provides authors’ surnames, initials of first names and in later years first names6
and addresses. On the notion that first authors and last authors have greatest responsibility for the
paper, we limited our analysis to papers in which we identified the ethnicity of first and last authors.
Thus our sample has ethnic identification for both authors in two-author papers, and for the first and
last author in other papers, but sometimes lack ethnic identification for some intermediate authors in
papers. We match names with ethnicity at a rate of 86%.

The rate of match increased over time, in

part because in later years the WoS has more first names, which allows the matching program to
more accurately identify ethnicity than initials.7 Appendix table A1 gives the numbers of papers in
our sample after the matching process. In total we had 2.634 million papers, of which 2.299 million
were the co-authored papers on which we focus.

Of those 1.505 million were papers with two to

four authors which constitutes the main sample on which we report results; they constitute 65% of all
co-authored papers in our data set.
variables for those papers.

Appendix Table A2 gives the mean and standard errors of key

We also analyzed papers with five to ten authors, which gave results

much like those for two to four authored papers and report some of those results.

Table A3 gives

the means and standard errors for the summary statistics of five-authored to ten-authored papers. We
examine papers separately by numbers of authors to allow for possible different interactions among
co-authors as the number of authors changes.
Table 1 presents the distribution of authors in two, three- and four-author papers by ethnicity
in our data set. The sum of statistics in a row equals to one. The “not identified” group consists of
middle positioned authors whose ethnicity we could not identify. The biggest change in the ethnic

We use first names if available.

They are available for all 2008 papers and a small number of papers in 2006 and

2007.

We identify both authors in 2-authored papers at 73.0%; identify at least two of the three-author papers in three-

authored papers at 73.1% and identify 3 or four authors of four-author papers at 74%. Note that these statistics are
consistent an 86% identification of ethnicity for individual authors since (0.86) x (0.86) =0.74

distribution of names is the near tripling in the frequency of Chinese names, which increased

from

4.79 percent in 1985 to 14.45 percent in 2006 and then dropped slightly in 2007 and 2008. The
proportion of names associated with ethnic origins in other developing countries such as Indian/
Hindi/South Asian, Hispanic/Filipino, and Vietnamese also increased, as did the proportion of
Russian and Korean names. By contrast, the proportion of English names dropped from 56.56
percent in 1985 to 45.56 percent in 2008, while the proportion of European names dropped from
13.47 percent to 11.18 percent.
The distributions in the table do not distinguish between American-born persons and foreignborn persons of the same ethnicity. For the fastest growing group, persons with Chinese names, the
increase is driven by increased numbers of researchers born overseas. We determine this by
exploiting the fact that persons born in China are more likely to have initials with the letters Z, Y, Q
and X than are persons born in the US. In our data set 0.3 percent of English names have Z, Y, Q, X
first initials compared to 24.2 percent of Chinese names. Assuming that the first names of US-born
Chinese are more Anglicized than the names of China-born Chinese,8 we estimate that 70.2 percent
of Chinese named authors in 1985 and 79.1 percent of Chinese named authors in 2008 were born in
China. Given the growth of Chinese names, this implies that 85 percent of the increased number of
Chinese named authors in the US were born in China.

1.1 Measuring homophily in the co-author population
To determine homophily among co-authors we compare the observed ethnic distribution of
names on papers to the ethnic distribution that would arise if co-authorship resulted from random
draws from an urn with the distribution of names in the observed population of authors (vide table 1).
If 20% of authors in the population of names had a given ethnicity, our null hypothesis would be that
8

For example a US born “Wang” might be named Don whereas someone born in China might be named Xia.

4% (= 0.202) of two authored papers would have authors of that ethnicity and that 0.8% (= 0.203) of
three authored papers would all have that ethnicity, and so on.
The results of this analysis, summarized in Table 2 for papers with 2-4 authors, provide
strong evidence of homophily in scientific teams. Columns 1–4 refine the table 1 distribution by
differentiating authors' ethnicity by the position of the authors in the paper. In most scientific fields,
the first-author is the junior person who did the most work on the paper while the last author is the
senior person whose laboratory housed and funded the work and who set the overall direction of the
research. Intermediate positions reflect the activity of other contributors of varying importance in the
project. Panel A shows that in the two-author paper sample, 16.6 percent of the first authors and 9.2
percent of second ones have Chinese names; while 49.8 percent of first authors and 60.2 percent of
second authors have English names. The higher proportion of Chinese names among first authors
reflects the entry of young Chinese researchers into US research, while the high proportion of
English names among second authors reflects the dominance of that group among senior scientists.
Our test for homophily in co-authorship compares the observed ethnic distribution of the
authors on papers to the counter-factual distribution that would arise from random draws of coauthors from the pool of authors by position. Rather than giving the full distribution of ethnicity, the
table records the proportion of papers in which all authors are of a given ethnicity and treats other
ethnic groups as “other”. Column 5 records the expected proportion of papers based on an ethnicity's
proportion of first authors, second authors, third authors, and fourth authors. The 1.52% for Chinesenamed authors in two-author papers is the multiplicand of 16.6% in column 1 and 9.15% in column 2.
Column (6) shows the actual proportion of papers with all authors of the same ethnicity.
Comparing column 6's realized proportion of authors of the same ethnicity with column 5's
expected proportions that authors would be the same ethnicity, we see that the realized proportions
are uniformly greater. The absolute differences between the random and realized proportions in

column 7 are statistically significant by the t-statistic of difference in means.

The differences are

largest for the largest groups. The ratios of the realized to random probabilities in column 8 are larger
for smaller groups. Given the likely greater role of first and last authors in the research, we also
calculated the proportion of 3 and 4 authored papers in which those two authors had the same
ethnicity and found that this proportion (not reported in the table) also exceeded that produced by
chance.9 We conclude that homophily is substantive among co-authors of scientific papers.10
To see the extent to which the observed homophily reflects the concentration of persons with
a given ethnicity among scientific disciplines or residence in the same region of the country, we
developed a regression model that modifies the random proportion by geographic location and field.
In this analysis someone residing in, say California, where many Chinese reside, would be more
likely to have a Chinese co-author than someone in Houston.

Someone in a specialty with many

Chinese specialists would be more likely to have a Chinese co-author, and so on. The results of this
counter-factual give similar results of homophily to those in the table.11 As a further check, we
compared the actual distribution of co-authors by ethnicity with the expected distribution based on
the probability model applied to each of the twelve fields in which WoS classifies papers12 for
every year in our data set and also found strong evidence for homophily.
The comparisons of the observed pattern of co-author ethnicity with the pattern that would
arise by chance document that homophily is a feature of scientific collaborations but do not identify

We also examined homophily conditional on an author's position in the paper, for instance taking as given the

ethnicity of a first author and estimating if the second author was exceptionally likely to be of the same ethnicity, and
then taking as given the ethnicity of the second author and estimating if the first author was exceptionally likely to be of
the same ethnicity. The conditional probabilities also show considerable homophily.

the structure of preferences or behavior that produces the homophily.

Researchers could be

disproportionately writing with people like themselves because persons in each group prefer to work
with persons of their ethnicity; or because persons in one group prefer to work with persons of their
ethnicity while persons in other groups have no such affinity; or from different rates of preference for
homophily among the groups. Since every author is a co-author of someone in the data set it is not
possible to identify whose preferences lie behind the observed pattern. To illustrate this point,
consider the random distribution of authors from two ethnic groups in two-authored papers. If 50%
of authors came from group A and 50% came from group B, the random distribution would have ½
of authors writing with persons of their own group (¼ all A co-authorship and ¼ all B co-authorship)
and ½ writing with someone from the other group. If persons in group A had an affinity for working
with people like themselves while persons in group B did not care with whom they worked, the
distributions would show more persons working with their own group than the random model. But
the same observed distribution could arise if persons in group B preferred working with persons like
themselves while those in group A did not care; if both groups cared equally; and so on.
Sophisticated modeling might give some insight into which group evinces greater preferences for
working with people like themselves13 but are no substitute for direct information about preferences .
To the extent that preferences toward working with one's own group vary within ethnic groups,
moreover, models based on average preferences will miss the role of heterogeneity of preferences in
determining observed homophily.14

13

The existence of three or more groups can help identify preferences for working with one's own group.

For

simplicity let one third of authors be in groups A, B, and C. If A is the only group that prefers to work with itself, the
deviation from the random pattern will be largest for A while the secondary effects will be divided between B and C.
14

As in the economic theory of discrimination, the realized distribution of outcomes will depend on the distribution of

preferences in different groups and the costs of searching to find persons fitting those preferences.

1.2 The Homophily of a Paper
With many ethnic groups and many authors on papers, measuring homophily as a
dichotomous “all persons of the same kind” variable does not adequately capture the phenomenon. A
paper with three authors of one ethnicity and one author of another ethnicity exhibits more
homophily than a paper with two authors of the same ethnicity and two authors of different ethnicity,
while the simple dichotomy puts them all under the same non-homophily category.

The

probabilistic framework underlying table 2 directs attention at a further complication: dependence of
papers written by persons of the same ethnicity due to the proportion of that ethnicity in the
population. A paper with all authors from a relatively small group is more reflective of homophily
than a paper with all authors from a relatively large group.

Having a paper with all Korean-named

authors, for instance, is stronger evidence of homophily than a paper with all
authors.

English-named

Indeed, a four-authored paper with three authors of a small ethnic group and one English

author could deviate more from the random distribution than if all four authors were from the larger
English-named group.

Analysis of homophily at the level of papers must take account both of the

ethnic similarity among authors and the ethnic distribution of the underlying distribution of the
population of authors.
We use a two step procedure to differentiate homophily of a paper due to behavior from the
homophily that would result from the size of ethnic groups in the population of authors.

First, we

create an Homophily Index that measures the ethnic concentration of authors on a paper regardless of
whether it comes from homophilous behavior or the concentration of an ethnicity in the population.
Our Index is analogous to the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index of concentration of production among
firms that specialists in industrial organization use to measure market structure.

Let N = number of

identified ethnic groups and si be the share of the ith group in the authors of a paper and let A be the
number of authors on a paper.

Then we define the Homophily Index for a given paper as the sum

of the squares of the shares of each group among the authors of the paper:
1)

H = ∑si 2 , where the summation is from i=1 to N

If all of the authors on a paper have the same ethnicity, H is 1.0, which is the maximum value
of homophily.

If the paper has authors of different ethnicity, H takes different discrete values for

papers depending on the number of ethnic groups and number of authors on a paper.

When the

number of ethnic groups is greater than or equal to the number of authors (as in our analysis), the
minimum value of H for a paper is 1/N.

of 6/16ths (one group has 2 authors and the remaining two authors come from different groups),
10/16ths (three authors from one group and one from a different group) and 1/2 (authors evenly
divided between two groups). With the nine ethnic groups we identify and the residual unidentified
ethnicity group, the H index follows this pattern through the ten-authored papers that are the
maximum we consider.15
The nature of our data produces a slight deviation in the H-index from that just described.
Because persons with a given surname can be of differing ethnicity, the ethnicity identification
program does not produce pure dichotomous measures of ethnic status. Instead, it gives a probability
to the ethnicity of a person – for instance Kim might be associated with 99.0% Korean and 1% with

some other ethnicity.

We use the full information in the data so that a “dummy variable” for Kim

being Korean takes the value 0.99 rather than 1.00 and so on.

The probabilities in most names are

sufficiently close to 1 for one ethnicity and 0 for all others that the distribution of the Homophily
Indexes for papers follows closely the pattern based on 0/1 measures described above.
While the Homophily index captures the concentration of authors by ethnicity, it does not
adjust for the differing frequency of ethnic groups in the population of authors.

The index gives a

paper with all Korean names the same 1.0 H-measure as it gives a paper with all-English names,
although, as noted, the all-Korean paper is a rarer event and thus reflective of greater ethnic affinity
than the all-English paper.

To take account of this in ensuing statistical calculations, we include

ethnic “dummy variables” for every author on a paper, where by dummies we mean the probabilities
that a given name is of a given ethnicity.

A regression of H on the ethnic “dummy variables” will

give relative larger coefficients on the dummies for groups that have a larger representation of
authors compared to any base reference group. To illustrate the calculation and show how it captures
the impact of population size on the index, consider a world of authors from two ethnic groups – a
large English-named group and a small Korean-named group.

The homophily index is 1 when

either English-named authors write with English-named authors and when Korean authors write with
Korean authors, and have the 1/2 otherwise. With more English-named authors in the population,
random association will produce more values of 1 for English-named authors than for Korean-named
authors. If population size is the sole reason for homophily, the regression of H on a dummy variable
for the first author having an English-name and for the second author having an English-name will
each obtain positive coefficients.

If we then regress an outcome of the paper – says the impact

factor of the journal of publication – on the homophily index and dummy variables for ethnicity of
authors, the homophily index captures the effect of homophily above and beyond that due to the size
of ethnic groups, which are reflected in the dummy variables.

Put differently a regression of the

outcome on homophily and the ethnic dummy variables of authors gives the coefficient on
homophily that one would obtain from taking the residual of the regression of the outcome on the
ethnic dummy variables on the residual of the regression of the homophily index on the ethnic
dummies – the effect of homophily on outcomes independent of the ethnic groups on the paper.
To make sure that our findings do not hinge critically on the way we measured homophily
and adjusted for its dependence on ethnic group size, we have experimented with other metrics and
find patterns analogous to those in the text.16

2. Relation between homophily of a paper and impact factors and citations
Does working with persons of the same ethnicity produce papers that have greater or lesser
scientific impact than working with persons of different ethnicity?
There are factors that might lead homophily to be associated with higher quality research.
To the degree that working with persons like oneself makes communication easier, homophily
should raise the productivity of the research team. People from the same group can communicate in
similarly accented English or switch to their native tongue if the English does not work. But there are
factors in the opposite direction as well.

To the degree that co-authoring with persons like oneself

reflects tastes/preferences for socializing at the expense of complementary research skills or
knowledge, homophily should be associated with reduced productivity, per standard analysis of
discriminatory preferences. Similarly, if preferences aside, persons of the same ethnicity think more
alike for whatever reason, working together may reduce the diversity of perspectives that can
produce novel scientific results.
To see which effect, if any, dominates, we examine the relation between the Homophily

In an earlier version of this paper, we adjusted the Homophily Index for the size of groups by changing the actual

index and obtained the same pattern of results.

Index and two measures of the scientific contribution of papers

– the impact factor of the journal

which published the paper17 and the number of citations the paper received as of 2008, the last year
of our sample.

Impact factors have the advantage of being available upon publication and

remaining fixed over time.

But they are an imperfect measure of the quality of a paper (European

Association of Science Editors, 2007). They show whether the paper was judged worth publication in
a more prestigious journal by presumably tough editors and reviewers but not whether any reader of
the journal found it useful or not.

For this reason, numbers of citations are arguably a more

accurate indication of the paper's scientific merit.

They also have the virtue of reflecting the

“wisdom of crowds (of knowledgeable scientists)” rather than the views of a few. But they also are
subject to problems (International Mathematical Union, 2008). One problem is that citations vary
with the number of scientists working in a field and with field specific norms for citing others' work.
We include of dummy variables for 180 sub fields to control for this problem. Another problem is
that citations likely depend on the size of a scientists' network: a paper by a senior researcher with
many students and collaborators may gain more citations than a comparable paper by a new
researcher with fewer connections. The fact that citations follow a distinctive non-normal
distribution, with 20% to 30% of papers obtaining no citations over an extended period and with
highly cited papers following a power law distribution (Redner, 2005; Gupta et al, 2005) creates
statistical problems.

To deal with this, we transform the number of citations of a paper into a

percentile distribution based on citations in the year of publication and use the 0-100 percentile as
our measure of citations.
Since journal impact factors are calculated from the citations of the papers in a journal in the
previous two years, impact factors and number of citations of articles are highly correlated.

17

The impact factor of a WoS journal in a year is the average number of citations to its articles in the preceding two

years. See Thomson-Reuters, http://thomsonreuters.com/products_services/science/academic/impact_factor

But

even so the two measures have enough independent variation to justify treating them separately.
Within the same journal, citations of papers varies widely.

Across journals some papers in lower

impact journals invariably gain more citations than most papers in high impact journals. Lozano,
Larivière, and Yves Gingras (2012) show that since 1990 the relation between impact factors and
paper citations has weakened, possibly because Internet search engines make it easier to find relevant
articles in less widely circulated journals.
We estimate the effect of homophily (H) on the impact factor of a paper (I) and the citation
percentile of the paper (CP ) using the following linear regression model:
(2) I or CP =

a H + b Vector of “Dummies” for Ethnicity of Authors + c Number of

Addresses + d Number of References + e (Vector of dummy variables for year of publication,
subfield, state, and interactions between publication year and subfield) + residual
The vector of ethnicity dummies for paper authors picks up the effect of differences in the
size of ethnic groups on the Homophily index.

It is a key covariate to identify the impact of

homophily behavior on outcomes exclusive of the size of ethnic groups as well as of any ethnicspecific pattern in outcomes.
We introduce the number of addresses on the paper as an indicator of the likely diversity of
ideas in the research.

Researchers working in different universities or research centers are likely to

bring a wider range of ideas, perspectives, and materials to the analysis than those working in the
same lab, which suggests that the coefficient on number of addresses will be positive. The measure
of addresses has one problem, however.

WoS reports the addresses of all authors on its data base,

but before 2008 it did not link addresses to specific authors so we cannot tell how many authors on a
multi-authored paper worked at any given address: on a 4 authored paper with two addresses, all
authors but one could be at one or other of the addresses and or the authors could split evenly
between the addresses.

The number of references in the paper indicates the breadth of knowledge on which the paper
presumptively relied and thus measures “the shoulders” of previous researchers the paper built on.
We expect it to obtain a positive coefficient on impact factors and citations.

But number of

references is an imperfect measure of the breadth of information in the paper, as authors put in
references for other reasons as well.18
The subfield dummy variables in the list of covariates allow for different levels of impact
factors and citations among fields.19
Table 3 summarizes our estimates of the equation for impact factors (panel A) and citation
percentile (panel B).

Columns 1-3 with the heading main sample report results for the 2-4 author

papers that we focus on in our analysis.

Columns (5) to (9) give the results for five to ten author

papers that make up the bulk of the remaining co-authored papers in the WoS.

The negative

significant coefficients on the Homophily index for Impact factors and Citation percentiles in nearly
all of the calculations shows that greater homophily is associated with publication in lower impact
journals and fewer citations, which presumptively implies that those papers are of lower quality than
other papers.

By contrast, the number of addresses and references in a paper have significant

estimated positive effects on the impact factor of the journal of publication and number of citations.
To the extent that the estimated impact of homophily reflects a narrower research perspective among
persons of the same ethnic group and that the number of addresses and references reflect a wider
research perspective among authors in different locations and/or who rely on a larger base of
previous work, both sets of results can be interpreted as reflecting the value of diversity in the inputs
going into a paper on its contribution.
18

Authors may face pressures by editors to cite their journal as part of the acceptance process (Willhite and Fong, 2012)

or decide themselves to refer to papers from potential referees. If these factors affect the references of papers in a similar
way, this will create measurement error in the true reliance on past work.
19

The percentile thresholds and number of citations in the percentiles in our data are available on request.

To check the robustness of our results, we also estimated equation 2 on 2-4 authored papers
in Pub Med, which many analysts use in scientometric work because Torvik and Smalheiser (2009)
developed a sophisticated algorithm for differentiating same-named people.

While name

disambiguation is not an issue in equation (2) it is critical in the analysis in section 3, which
estimates the part of the observed homophily-outcome relation that is due to differences in the past
publications of authors in our sample with differing levels of homophily.

Table 4 gives the

estimated coefficients of impact factor and citation percentile on homophily, number of addresses,
and number of references in 2-4 authored papers in the PubMed data set.

The results are quite

similar to those in table 3: negative coefficients on homophily and positive coefficients on addresses
and references.

3. Probing the Negative Homophily-Paper Outcome Relation
The negative relation between the homophily of a paper and the impact of its journal of
publication and the number of citations to the paper could be due to two possible factors.
is selectivity of researchers.

The first

Researchers of lesser scientific prominence, measured say by their

prior publication performance, may disproportionately write with persons like themselves and
produce papers with publication and citation outcomes consistent with their past performance. The
second reason is that interactions among persons of similar ethnicity produce less novel research than
interactions among persons from more diverse backgrounds.

In this section we examine the extent

to which the weaker outcomes of papers with greater homophily in tables 3 and 4 are attributable to
the presumably weaker publication performance of their authors.
This analysis faces one major problem: disambiguation of names in determining the past
publication record of authors in the WoS.

Until 2008 the WoS reported the first initial and last

name of authors, which creates potential errors in attributing papers to researchers with common

names and first initials. The J. Kim who is first author on a given paper may have not written any
earlier papers but his or her namesake J. Kim may have done so, producing measurement error if we
attach the second J. Kim's papers to the first J. Kim.
regarding the distinct names in our WoS data set.

Appendix Table A4 gives the statistics

Our sample contains over 2.57 million papers

and over 7.4 million names, of which 1,303,22, are distinct names, implying that on average a name
appears 5.69 times. Of those, 569,618 names (nearly 44 percent of all distinct names) appear once
and thus cannot be used to obtain a research track record with which to judge productivity prior to
the paper in our data.

To differentiate which of the 733,606 names that appear more than once

reflect the same person and which reflect different persons, we assume that people with the same
names writing in the same scientific field are the same while those with papers in different fields are
another person.

In our disambiguation the J. Kim who publishes on physics is different than the J.

Kim who publishes on biochemistry. We use the twelve major fields for which WoS sorts papers to
differentiate same named authors. The resultant calculation yields 1,390,470 names-field that appear
more than once – nearly twice as many distinct authors as the number of author names with more
than a single publication.

By construction, differentiating names by field produces more individual

authors.
We could further differentiate names by narrow sub fields but the risks failing to attribute
papers to an author whose research crosses narrow disciplinary lines. Instead of further dividing
names by field, we undertook robustness checks on our findings.

We eliminated all names with

“large” numbers of papers for varying definitions of large and obtained results similar to those in the
text table.

We also do separate calculations on the life sciences subset of the WoS that overlaps

with Pub Med papers.

As noted, the advantage of Pub Med is that Torvik and Smallheiser (2009)

have developed a disambiguation algorithm of Pub Med names that is more sophisticated than ours.20
20

Other studies that disambiguate the names of scientists include

(Huang 2013) and (Ferreira et al 2011).

Thus, PubMed offers a more accurate test of relations between outcomes and past author
publications at the cost of a smaller sample limited to the life sciences.
Our analysis proceeds in two steps.

First, we assess the relation between the prior

publications of the first and last authors and the homophily index – a necessary prerequisite for those
publications to influence the estimated impact of the index on paper outcomes.

Second, we add

measures of prior publications to the equation (2) regressions and compare the estimated coefficient
on homophily in equations which include the past publication records to those in tables 3 and 4
which do not.
We focus on the publication records of the first and last authors since in most fields these are
the two most important authors: the first author is often the younger person who does the bulk of the
laboratory work and the last author is often the senior professor who initiated the project and in
whose laboratory it took place.

A preliminary analysis found little relation between the past

publication records of intermediate authors and paper outcomes, supporting this decision.
We examine two measures of authors' prior publication records: number of papers written
and the impact factors of the journal in which those papers appeared, which can be viewed crudely as
quantity and quality of past work.

We formed three dummy variables from these measures to

reflect how the the authors on a given paper compared to other first and last authors: whether the
number of the previous papers was (1) above the median number of papers for authors in their
position; or (2) below the median number of papers for authors in their position; and (3) whether the
average impact factor of previous publications was above the median impact factor for authors in
their position.

The reference group for these measures are persons who wrote no previous papers

and had by definition no impact factors for previous papers.
Table 5 gives the estimated coefficients and standard errors for the regression relation
between the homophily index (multiplied by 100 to make the coefficients easier to read) and these

measures of past publication and of one additional variable – the number of addresses on the paper,
whose coefficients indicate whether homophily is more or less likely when co-authors are in
differing locations.

Columns 1-3 give the results for the WoS sample. Columns 4-6 give the results

for the PubMed sample. The estimated coefficients vary by number of papers and between the WoS
and PubMed samples but the pattern of results are clear.

The impact factors of previous papers for

the last author and for the first author are negatively related to homophily: the index obtains
significant negative coefficients in five of the six columns for the last author's publications and in
four of the six columns for the

first author's publications.

By contrast, the number of papers

written by authors shows a weaker and less consistent sign pattern across the numbers of papers and
the data sets. These differences could reflect differences in the way teams form of different sizes or
between the bio-medical sciences and others.

Absent a formal model and study of the decisions to

form teams, we simply note the correlation patterns, as they will affect the impact of adding these
measures to analysis of the homophily-outcome relation.
Turning to the number of addresses, it is unclear a priori whether we should expect
homophily to be larger or smaller among authors in the same locale or across locales.

On the larger

side, students of the same ethnicity often work in the same labs for professors of their ethnicity,
which suggests that papers with the same address would evince greater homophily.21 If authors care
more about the ethnicity of geographically close collaborators with whom they interact often than
about the ethnicity of distant collaborators, we would also expect greater homophily on papers with
the same address. But geographic closeness may substitute for ethnic closeness in connecting
researchers. Researchers may be more likely to meet persons of different ethnicity at their university
than at some distant location. This would produce less homophily on papers with fewer addresses
21

Tanyildiz, (2008) shows that students from a given country are more likely to enroll in universities with faculty from

their native country and which already have many students from their country and are likely to work in labs populated by
students from the same country of origin under the direction of foreign-born faculty.

(Agrawal et al. 2008). Absent direct measures of how collaborators actually met and decided to work
on project together (see Freeman et al. 2014 for survey evidence on how authors meet), the most we
can do is

to estimate the net direction of numbers of addresses on homophily.

The estimates in

table 5 on number of addresses show strong negative effects on homophily for three-author and fourauthor papers in the WoS and PubMed but differing effects for the two-author papers between the
WoS and PubMed samples.
Overall, the strong negative relation between the average impact factors of first and last
author's paper and homophily and the varying weaker effects of numbers of papers on homophily,
suggest that, as long as the publication performance of scientists shows some persistence over time,
adding these measures as explanatory factors to the earlier regressions of paper outcomes on
homophily will weaken the estimated adverse effects of homophily.

The regressions in tables 6 and

7 show that this is indeed the case for impact factors and citations in both the WoS and the PubMed
data sets, but that homophily still has negative effects on the two outcome measures.
Columns 1-3 of Table 6 summarize the results of the regressions of impact factors on
homophily and other key explanatory variables in the WoS data set with the new measures of the
publishing record of first and last authors.
smaller than those in table 3

The estimated negative coefficients on homophily are

by about 15-20%.

The measure for the average impact factor has a

huge effect in these regressions, particularly for last authors, whose impact factor measure obtains a
regression coefficient roughly twice that for first authors (0.608 vs 0.305 in the two-authored papers
column 1 regression), which suggests that the last author has a greater role in getting a paper into a
higher impact journal than the first author. The huge strong relation between average past impact
factors and the current impact factor may reflect the persistence of authors publishing in the same or
similar journals, possibly because of the subject matter of the research or its quality. The results on
numbers of previous papers are more mixed, with positive estimated coefficients for last author's

papers on the impact factor but negative coefficients on first-authors papers.

Perhaps the quantity

and quality of papers are substitutes for first authors, with the more able researchers moving to first
authorship quickly while the less able obtain many middle author positions before they become first
authors. The only way to unpack the observed pattern is to follow the life cycle trajectory of
beginning researchers, which goes beyond this paper.
Columns 4-6 of table 6 give comparable results when the dependent variable is the number of
citations received by the paper through 2008.

Addition of the publishing record measures reduces

the negative coefficients on homophily for three-author and four-author papers while increasing the
positive effect for two-author papers.

The regression coefficients on the past publication variables

for both first and last authors are strongly positive but are still considerably larger for last authors
than for first authors.

Whichever measure of past publication record we look at, last authors have a

larger effect on the impact factor of publication and citations of a paper than first authors.
The results from the analogous analysis of the Pub Med data set summarized in Table 7 tell a
similar story.

The addition of authors' past publishing records reduces but does not eliminate the

negative effects attributed to the homophily index on impact factors and citations (and slightly
increasing the insignificant positive coefficient among three-author papers in column 5 compared to
the comparable regression in table 4).

The estimated effects of last authors' publication record on

both impact factors and citations are considerably larger than those for first authors' publications.
Finally, note that in both tables addition of the authors past publication record reduces but
does not eliminate the estimated positive relation between the number of addresses and number of
references and the impact factor and citation percentile outcome measures.

4. Conclusion
Our analysis shows that homophily is a substantive phenomenon in co-authorship in scientific

papers and thus in the make-up of the research teams that produce the papers.

It also shows that

homophily is associated with papers with lower impact factors and fewer citations; and that while
part of this effect is traceable to the weaker prior publication performance of the authors of papers
with greater homophily, a substantive negative relation between homophily and paper outcomes still
remains.

In addition, we find that the number of addresses and the number of references are

strongly associated with publishing in a higher impact journal and gaining more citations.
A reasonable interpretation of the pattern for homophily, addresses, and references is that
greater diversity and breadth of knowledge of a research team contributes to the quality of the
scientific papers that the team produces. While we have not tested this interpretation, it is testable.
One approach would be to examine the terms, techniques, and references in papers. If diversity
contributes to productivity by widening ideas, papers from more diverse collaborations should
contain a wider range of scientific terms, use more varied equipment, procedures, or data and
reference a wider range of previous work than papers from more homogeneous groups.22

Another

approach would be to deal directly with the possibility that having co-authors of different ethnicity
increases citations through network effects rather than through novel ideas by estimating the size of
co-authors networks, say in terms of the number of their co-authors, and examine the linkages among
the size of co-author networks, citations, and homophily of authors. The last and potentially most
difficult way to illuminate homophily and its link to scientific outcomes would be to analyze the
decisions of researchers to collaborate with each other.

Here, the evidence that the attributes of last

authors are more important than those of first authors in explaining outcomes suggests that a
theory of collaboration might fruitfully begin by treating the last author as the initiator of the
collaboration rather than by treating the collaboration as a partnership among equals.

22

In the health sciences, a natural measure for such analysis would be the medical subject heading (Mesh) terms.

Latent text analysis of keywords and of the combination of words in the text could also provide metrics of novelty.

NOTE: Only US papers are kept. The sample is from WoS 1985-2008. Because we use surnames to match only, the match rate is 84%, which is
lower than ususal match rates when both first and last names are available. For two-author papers, we keep those papers in which both authors are
identified; in three- and four- author paper sample, we keep those with at least two authors identified.
