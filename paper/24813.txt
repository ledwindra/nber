The Labor Market for Teachers Under Different Pay Schemes

ABSTRACT
Compensation of most US public school teachers is rigid and solely based on seniority. This paper
studies the labor market effects of a reform that gave school districts in Wisconsin full autonomy to
redesign teacher pay schemes. Following the reform, some districts switched to flexible compensation
and started paying high-quality teachers more. Teacher quality increased in these districts relative
to those with seniority pay due to a change in workforce composition and an increase in effort. I estimate
a structural model of this labor market to investigate the effects of counterfactual pay schemes on the
composition of the teaching workforce.

Introduction
Teachers are a central input in the production of student achievement (Rockoff, 2004; Rivkin

et al., 2005), and their impact persists into adulthood (Chetty et al., 2011, 2014b). Therefore,
policies that attract and retain high-quality teachers to the profession have far-reaching consequences.1 More attractive compensation packages are sometimes proposed as a tool to attract
effective teachers. However, in most US public school districts, the setting of teacher pay does
not allow for the payment of financial rewards for effectiveness. If allowed to determine pay
in a more flexible way, could school districts improve the quality of their teaching workforce?
This paper addresses this question by taking advantage of a reform to the collective-bargaining
process for teachers in Wisconsin, and offers a comprehensive study of this labor market.
Studying the effects of changes in the structure of teacher pay on labor supply and demand
is challenging due to a dearth in variation in pay practices among public school districts.2 The
vast majority of districts pay teachers according to similar lock-step schedules. This implies that
all teachers with the same education degree and years of experience are paid identically, regardless of their effectiveness or the demand for their labor (Podgursky, 2006). In addition, these
schedules are often very similar across all districts within a state, owing to pattern bargaining
facilitated by the state’s teachers’ union. With salaries set in this rigid way, identifying the effects
of changes in pay schemes is very difficult.
To investigate these questions, I exploit a rare source of variation in teacher pay. In 2011, the
Wisconsin legislature unexpectedly passed Act 10, a law that discontinued collective bargaining
requirements over teachers’ salary schedules. Previously, teacher pay was determined solely by
seniority and education, using schedules negotiated between each school district and its union.
Act 10 allowed districts full autonomy to determine compensation without union consent and,
importantly, allowed them to negotiate salaries with individual teachers.
Districts used the flexibility introduced by Act 10 in different ways. Hand-collected information from 2015 employee handbooks (documents listing district-specific workplace policies
and procedures) reveals that approximately half of the districts quickly took advantage of their
1

The monetary cost of recruiting, hiring and training replacement teachers has been estimated to be around
$15,000 in 2000, which translates into a $2.25 billion cost for the US as a whole. Turnover can negatively affect
student achievement both directly, by disrupting instruction (Boyd et al., 2008; Ronfeldt et al., 2013), and indirectly,
by affecting the composition of the teaching workforce (Adnot et al., 2017).
2
Other works have used other changes in teachers’ labor markets to learn about teacher supply and demand.
For example, Hensvik (2012) studies the effect of private vouchers, Jackson (2009) examines the influence of school
de-desegregation, and Fitzpatrick and Lovenheim (2014) study the impact of an early teacher retirement policy.

new-found discretion and replaced seniority-based schedules with flexible salary schemes that
allowed for pay differences among teachers with similar seniority. For ease of exposition, I refer
to these districts as “flexible pay” (FP). The other half, which I call “seniority pay” (SP), maintained the use of seniority-based schedules as of the publication of their 2015 handbook.
Act 10 triggered significant differences in salaries among teachers in FP districts who would
have been paid exactly the same amount under the pre-Act 10 regime. To shed light on what
drove these differences, I test whether a teacher’s pay is correlated with her value-added (VA), a
widely used measure of effectiveness. Standard VA models are designed for datasets that allow
to link teachers and students through classroom identifiers. As is true of most administrative
datasets, however, data from Wisconsin only allow teachers and students to be linked up to
the grade level. To estimate teacher effects in the presence of this data limitation, I develop
a new estimator based on teacher turnover as in Rivkin et al. (2005). I validate this estimator
using data from New York City teachers and students (which include classroom identifiers) and
I show that, while less precise than standard VA, this estimator is an unbiased predictor of a
teacher’s effectiveness.
VA estimates and information on teachers’ salaries indicate that, after Act 10, salaries of highVA teachers rose more than did those of low-VA teachers in FP districts, but not in SP districts.
This is an interesting finding in itself; school districts in Wisconsin do not use VA to evaluate
teachers nor do they even calculate it. This suggests that districts can identify highly effective
teachers and, when allowed, chose to reward them more.
The differences in teacher salaries that arose among districts after Act 10 could have changed
teachers’ incentives to work in a given district, and in turn, could have affected each district’s
workforce composition. To see this, consider for example the school districts of Appleton (FP)
and Oshkosh (SP), which belong to the same commuting zone in Eastern Wisconsin. In 2010,
prior to Act 10, a teacher with a Master’s degree and 4 years of experience would earn $47,000
per year in Appleton (with a minimum of $46,500 and a maximum of $49,000) and $45,800
in Oshkosh (with a minimum of $42,000 and a maximum of $49,000), according to each district’s pay schedule. After the reform, the highest salary a teacher with those attributes could
earn in Appleton rose to $68,000, while the lowest stayed at $44,000. In Oshkosh, on the other
hand, the same teacher would earn between $39,000 and $43,000. To the extent that salary
was performance-based in Appleton, a simple Roy model (Roy, 1951) predicts that high-quality
teachers would move from Oshkosh to Appleton, whereas low-quality teachers would move

3

from Appleton to Oshkosh or leave the market altogether. Indeed, although in the four years
prior to the reform only four teachers moved from Oshkosh to Appleton, in the four years after
Act 10 ten teachers moved. Further, all of the movers ranked above median for VA, and experienced an average salary increase of 16 percent ($6,500) per year. By contrast, the five teachers
who moved from Appleton to Oshkosh after Act 10 all ranked below median for VA, and did
not experience any significant increase in salary.
Extending this analysis to all districts confirm these patterns: After Act 10, teachers with ex
ante higher VA (measured using pre-Act 10 test scores) were 1.13 times more likely to move from
SP to FP districts compared with lower VA teachers, and 44 percent less likely to exit. These
labor-supply responses produced a 0.05-0.07 standard deviations increase in average teacher
quality in FP districts, relative to SP districts. These results demonstrate, partly in contrast with
previous studies (such as Hanushek et al., 2004), that higher pay does attract teachers in some
contexts.
In addition to affecting the composition of teachers, rewarding their effectiveness may also
influence teachers’ effort in the classroom. To test this hypothesis I allow VA to vary before and
after Act 10 for each teacher, and I estimate the FP-SP difference in this time-varying measure
after Act 10 compared with before. I find that, overall, VA increased by 0.11 standard deviations
in FP districts relative to SP. Approximately 40 percent of this increase is due to changes in
teacher effort, whereas the remaining 60 percent is due to changes in composition.
Although the differences in pay schemes between FP and SP districts after Act 10 create
a unique setting to learn about their effects on teachers’ labor markets, this setting involves
several challenges that bear mentioning. First, post-Act 10 pay schemes were chosen by district administrators and could therefore be related to a range of district-level observable and
unobservable characteristics that directly affect outcomes. Second, Act 10 did not just change
teachers’ salaries; it also increased employees’ contributions to pensions and health care, and it
reduced the power of unions. Interpreting the post-Act changes in outcomes between FP and
SP districts as the effect of changes in pay requires assuming that any pre-existing differences
between these two groups of districts did not change after Act 10 and that the other provisions
of the Act (which applied to all districts) affected FP and SP districts in the same way. In support
of these assumptions, I perform a series of checks: 1) I show that FP and SP districts are on parallel pre-trends with respect to all my outcome variables; 2) I show that FP and SP districts also
exhibit parallel trends in a variety of attributes, including funding, union influence, and student

4

attributes; 3) I demonstrate that the results are not affected by controlling for a wide range of
time-varying observable factors, or by estimation on a matched sample; and 4) I perform the
bounding exercise of Altonji et al. (2005) to account for selection into FP on the basis of unobservables. This exercise shows that, at worst, time-varying unobservables explain 7 percent of
the main effect, suggesting that the scope for bias is limited.
My findings indicate that the introduction of flexible pay in a subset of Wisconsin districts
led to an improvement in the composition of the teaching workforce in these districts compared
with the rest of the state. This compositional change is fairly small (0.05 standard deviations
of VA), as movements and exits are rare events even after Act 10. The change could become
more pronounced over time as more low-quality teachers leave the market from FP districts
and more high-quality teachers enter the profession, especially if pay becomes more strongly
correlated with teacher effectiveness. This scenario, however, assumes that SP districts stick
with seniority pay in the medium and long run. What would happen if the same flexible pay
scheme were introduced in all districts instead? The sorting and exiting patterns outlined so far
are the combination of both demand and supply forces; it is therefore difficult to answer this
question by simply extrapolating from these partial-equilibrium results.
To address the limitations of a reduced-form approach, I build and estimate a structural
model of the teachers’ labor market. Districts (the demand side) extend job offers to teachers
(the supply side). These offers are characterized by salaries, modeled as an exogenous, districtspecific function of seniority, education, and VA (I relax the binary FP-SP assumption and estimate salary functions at the district level). Teachers have preferences over a job’s attributes
(including salary). They review all the offers they receive and choose the one that maximizes
their utility (or choose to exit the labor market). Districts decide which job offers to extend in
order to maximize a payoff that depends on teachers’ attributes, subject to a budget constraint
(on the total wage bill) and a capacity constraint (on the total number of teachers they need to
hire). Importantly, when making hiring decisions, districts take into account the fact that the
probability that a given offer is accepted depends on both teachers’ preferences and the offers
made by all the other districts. This feature of the model allows supply and demand to match
in equilibrium.
To identify the parameters of teacher supply, I exploit the differences in pay triggered by Act
10 combined with teachers’ movements and exits. Demand parameters are identified by crossdistrict differences in budget and capacity constraints (which arise when teachers move out of

5

or exit from the district), combined with a district’s decision on how to fill its vacancies and how
to allocate its budget.3
The model model permits separate identification of the impact of supply and demand on job
matches in equilibrium. Supply estimates are particularly useful for policy: They can be used to
compute the monetary value of non-wage job characteristics valued by teachers and to quantify,
for example, how much more a certain teacher would have to be paid to be induced to teach in a
different district. Estimates of the supply parameters show that teachers are attracted by higher
salaries, dislike moving to far-away districts, and face significant moving costs.
I use the model to simulate how the composition of the teaching workforce would change
under two alternative pay schemes. The first consists of one district increasing its salary/quality
correlation (which I use as a proxy for “merit” or “quality” pay) and confirms the reduced-form
findings. The second analyzes the introduction of quality pay in all districts, a more challenging
question to study due to general equilibrium effects. Simulations show that this second scheme
is associated with a much smaller increase in workforce quality compared with the first: When
all districts reward seniority at the same rate, teachers have lower incentives to move across
districts, and any compositional improvement is entirely driven by exits of low-quality teachers.
This exercise is useful to understand what would happen if all districts switched to flexible
pay, a scenario that could easily arise in Wisconsin when SP districts realize that they are losing
good teachers. It also suggests that the observed improvement in the composition of the teaching workforce experienced by FP districts might be short-lived, resulting in smaller long-term
effects of a statewide change in pay schemes.
A few limitations of the model should be kept in mind when interpreting these results. First,
the model does not explicitly allow for workers’ decisions to enter the teaching profession, and
it implicitly assumes that the quality of new teachers is constant over time and unaffected by the
reform. In the medium run, a change in teacher pay could fundamentally alter the selection of
new teachers in FP and SP districts (Dolton, 1990; Hoxby and Leigh, 2004; Rothstein, 2014; Kraft
et al., 2018).4 Second, the model does not incorporate changes in effort. Even under the second
counterfactual, where compositional gains are small, the benefits to schools and students could
3

Section 7.3 discusses identification of the model’s parameters more in depth.
Dolton (1990) emphasizes the importance of earnings growth in the decision to become a teacher. Hoxby and
Leigh (2004) show that the increase in wage compression that followed the rise in unionization explains most of the
decline in entry of high-performing teachers in the US since 1960. Rothstein (2014) suggests that higher salaries and
lower tenure rates can improve the supply of new teachers. Lastly, Kraft et al. (2018) suggest that the introduction of
teacher evaluation policies led to a decline in the supply of new teachers. A simple analysis of the selectivity of college
degrees for new teachers (as a proxy for teaching quality) does not show evidence of changes in the composition of
new teachers after 2011.

be large if all teachers respond to the change in pay scheme by exerting more effort.
This paper makes three main contributions. First, it exploits newly-available, large-scale
variation in pay schemes to estimate teachers’ labor supply and demand. Previous studies have
been limited to small bonuses awarded on top of regular pay (Hanushek et al., 2004; Clotfelter
et al., 2008; Dee and Wyckoff, 2015), limited cross-sectional variation in salaries (Stinebrickner,
2001; Boyd et al., 2013), and across-the-board salary increases (Figlio, 2002).5
This paper can also be seen as an exploration, in the personnel economics tradition, of how
pay affects selection and incentives of a particularly important class of workers (Lazear, 2000a,b;
Bandiera et al., 2005; Abramitzky, 2009; Khan et al., 2015). Financial incentives for teachers
have been shown to have a significant impact on student achievement outside the US.6 Plans
implemented in the US, however, have yielded mixed results (see Jackson et al., 2014; Neal
et al., 2011, for a review).7 In addition, this paper provides new evidence that school districts are
willing to compensate high VA teachers when given the opportunity to do so and that teachers
respond to these incentives by exerting more effort in the classroom (Imberman and Lovenheim,
2015; Brehm et al., 2017).
Lastly, this paper is one of the first to study the effects of a recent decline in union powers.
Most studies of teachers’ unions have analyzed increases in unionization (Eberts and Stone,
1987; Hoxby, 1996; Lovenheim, 2009).8 Reducing union powers, however, does not necessarily
have symmetric effects. The effects of a decline in unionization on teachers’ labor markets are
particularly interesting in the aftermath of Janus v. AFSCME, as more states could be affected in
the future.
The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the institutional framework
and describes Act 10. Section 3 presents the data. Sections 4, 5, and 6 describe the empirical
findings on salaries, the composition of the workforce, and teachers’ effort respectively. Section 7 describes the structural model, and Section 8 illustrates the results from simulations of
counterfactual pay schemes. Section 9 concludes.

Willén (2018) studies the introduction of individual wage bargaining for Swedish public school teachers. Unlike
Act 10, however, this policy change did not lead to pay differences among high-quality and low-quality teachers. As
a result, it had no effects on workforce composition (in terms of demographics) or student outcomes.

This literature includes studies conducted in India (Muralidharan and Sundararaman, 2011; Duflo et al., 2012),
Israel (Lavy, 2002), England (Atkinson et al., 2009), and Kenya (Glewwe et al., 2010).
7
Although some studies have found that teacher performance pay has positive effects on student test scores in
the US (Ladd, 1999; Figlio and Kenny, 2007; Sojourner et al., 2014; Imberman and Lovenheim, 2015; Dee and Wyckoff,
2015; Brehm et al., 2017), others have shown that such incentives are ineffective at boosting achievement (Dee and
Keys, 2004; Figlio and Kenny, 2007; Springer et al., 2011; Goodman and Turner, 2013; Fryer, 2013).

Notable exceptions are Han (2016), Litten (2016), and Roth (2017), who study the effects of recent episodes of
de-unionization on outcomes such as teacher turnover, teacher salaries, retirement, and student achievement.

Teacher Compensation Before and After Act 10
In most US public school districts, teacher salaries are determined using “steps-and-lanes”

salary schedules that express pay as a function of years of experience and highest education
degree (Podgursky, 2006). Appendix Figure A1 shows an example of a salary schedule. Movements along its “steps” (rows, which correspond to experience levels) and “lanes” (columns,
which correspond to education degrees) are associated with an increase in pay.
In states with collective bargaining (CB) for public sector employees, these schedules are
negotiated between school districts and teachers’ unions, while in states without CB they are
typically determined at the state level (e.g. Georgia).9 CB agreements usually prevent districts
from adjusting pay at the individual level: Experience and education are the only determinants
of salaries and pay is unrelated (at least directly) to teacher effectiveness (Podgursky, 2006).

2.1

Wisconsin’s Act 10
In 1959, Wisconsin became the first state to introduce CB for public sector employees (Moe,

2013). Since then, teachers’ unions have gained considerable power and have been involved in
negotiations with school districts over key aspects of a teaching job.10 Until 2011 teacher salaries
were set using a schedule, which was part of each district’s CB agreement.
On June 29, 2011, the state legislature passed the Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill, which came
to be known as Act 10. Intended to address a projected $3.6 billion budget deficit through
cuts in public sector spending, Act 10 introduced a number of provisions, enforced onto all
school districts and their employees. First and most importantly, Act 10 limits the scope of
salary negotiations to base salaries (whose annual growth rate is limited to the rate of inflation),
hence preventing unions from negotiating the salary schedule. Second, it requires unions to hold
yearly recertification elections, limits the validity of CB agreements to one year, and prohibits
automatic collection of union dues from employees’ paychecks.11 Third, it raised employee
9

As of 2014, 49 percent of public school teachers belonged to at least one union (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2014).
Schools are unionized on a district-by-district basis. While CB is not a constitutional right for public sector teachers,
at the time of writing this right was granted by all states except Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and
Virginia.
10
424 public school districts in Wisconsin typically serve either one city or one or more towns and villages. They
operate public schools, hire teachers, and allocate teachers to schools. Each district enrolls an average of 1,900 students. Sixteen urban districts enroll 15,000 students on average (with Milwaukee Public Schools enrolling 67,000
students and the Madison Metropolitan School District enrolling 26,500 students), 63 suburban districts enroll 3,000
students, and 344 rural districts enroll 1,000.
11
In 26 right-to-work states, including Texas, Florida, and Wisconsin, teachers who choose not to join the union
are not required to pay monthly dues, despite being covered by collective-bargaining (CB) agreements. In all other
states (including California, New York, and Illinois) non-union teachers are also required to pay a fee to the union as

8

contributions to the pension fund (from 0 to 5.8 percent of wages) and to health insurance premia
(from 0 to 12.6 percent), and it required districts to actively search for the most cost-effective
health care plans. Lastly, it reduced state aid to school districts and decreased their revenue
limit.12
2.1.1 Act 10 and Teacher Salaries: Flexible Pay vs. Seniority Pay
With salary schedules no longer allowed in CB agreements, Wisconsin districts have gained
the possibility to determine teacher pay more flexibly. In particular, they are now allowed to
reward teachers for attributes not directly compensated by standard schedules and to adjust
salaries on an individual basis without union consent.
Although the provisions of Act 10 applied to all school districts, the way in which districts
reacted to their new freedom over teacher pay-setting varied: As of 2015, approximately half
of all districts were still setting pay using a schedule only based on experience and education,
whereas the remaining half had discontinued the use of such a schedule. To characterize each
district’s post-Act 10 pay regime I collected districts’ employee handbooks, documents listing
the duties and rights of all teachers. Before Act 10, all handbooks contained a schedule; after
Act 10, only some of them do. I classify all districts whose 2015 handbooks included a schedule
(and did not mention any other types of bonuses or increments) as seniority-pay (SP) and all
the remaining districts as flexible-pay (FP). More information on the handbooks is contained in
Section 3.
The Racine Metropolitan School District, one of the state’s largest urban districts, is an example of a SP district: Its 2015 handbook contains a seniority-based schedule (Appendix Figure
A1).13 The handbook specifies that both a teacher’s initial placement on the schedule and movements along steps and lanes are to be determined solely on the basis of seniority and academic
credentials.
The Green Bay Area Public School District, the fifth largest in Wisconsin, is an example of
a FP district. Its 2015 handbook does not contain a schedule, and it explicitly states that “[t]he
District will determine the starting salary for a new employee.”14 While the handbook mentions
a condition of employment. Union membership dropped by nearly 50 percent in Wisconsin in the 5 years after the
passage of Act 10. See D. Belkin and K. Maher, Wisconsin Unions See Ranks Drop Ahead of Recall Vote, The Wall Street
Journal. Retrieved from https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304821304577436462413999718.
12
This last provision was included in Act 32 of July 1, 2011, which amended some provisions of Act 10. Revenue
limits are the maximum level of revenues a district can raise through general state aid and local property taxes.

the possibility that teachers’ salaries might increase in steps over time, no indication is given
that such steps will be solely linked to seniority and education. The handbook also specifies that
“[a]n employee may be held to the previous year’s step for less than satisfactory performance.”
This language, common among FP districts, indicates that the district retains the autonomy to
set teacher salaries on an individual basis and to adjust them every year as it sees fit.
2.1.2 Comparing FP and SP Districts: Identification Challenges
Decisions over post-Act 10 pay schemes were made by school district administrators (such
as superintendents and school board members). Possible drivers of this decision include fiscal
concerns, the desire to compensate high-quality teachers or to preserve teachers’ morale, and
the increased pressure to compete with other districts for talented teachers (Kimball et al., 2016).
This decision could be correlated with time-varying observable and unobservable characteristics of the school districts. For example, districts with an ex ante lower-quality workforce or
lower student achievement could choose to switch to FP in an attempt to improve, or wealthier
districts could switch because they can afford to spend more on salaries. Differences in observable and unobservable characteristics pose a challenge for the identification of a causal effect
of changes in pay structures across districts if they vary over time; interpreting any post-Act
10 comparison in outcomes between FP and SP districts as the causal effect of pay structures
requires assuming that these differences remained constant after 2011.
A simple comparison of observable characteristics across FP and SP districts before Act 10
shows that FP districts served a lower share of low-SES students, paid higher salaries to teachers
and principals, had less experienced teachers, and are more likely to be located in suburban
areas with higher property values (Table 1 and Appendix Table A1). These differences, however,
did not change after Act 10 (Appendix Figure A2). Appendix Table A1 estimates differencein-differences models that compare these observables across FP and SP districts over time.15
Estimates for FP * post, which capture the change in the FP-SP difference after Act 10, are all
small and insignificant.16 While not necessarily informative of changes in unobservables, these
tests rule out the possibility that any differences in outcomes between FP and SP districts after
Act 10 could be driven by changes in observables over time.
15

Appendix Table A1 shows estimates of ↵ and in Xdt = ↵F Pd + F P d ⇤ postt + postt +"dt , where Xdt includes
a range of district attributes, F P d equals 1 for FP districts, and postt equals 1 for years after Act 10. Estimates of ↵
capture ex ante differences in attributes between FP and SP districts, while estimates of capture the change in this
difference after Act 10.
16
Trends in these observables are shown in Appendix Figures A2, A3, A4, and A5.

10

A possible confounder that deserves mention is districts’ management. A switch to FP could
correlate with better managerial capabilities, as it requires quantifying hard-to-measure teacher
attributes (such as performance). More generally, superintendents and principals of FP districts
may have different perceptions of what constitutes a “fair” compensation scheme or may differentially value teachers’ characteristics (such as experience or quality).17 This could translate into
different managerial practices and could have a direct effect on the outcomes of interest. Superintendents and principals, however, have a very limited scope for differentiating their practices,
as most teachers’ duties and rights are strictly regulated by CB agreements (both before and
after Act 2011). Even if managerial practices were different between FP and SP districts, these
differences would only be problematic if they arose at the same time as Act 10. Furthermore, the
data indicate that superintendents, principals, and other managerial staff are observationally
similar across FP and SP districts (Appendix Tables A1 and A2). This suggests that the decision
to switch to FP was likely influenced by idiosyncratic preferences of local leaders rather than by
systematic differences in management.
Other Provisions of Act 10. In addition to changing teachers’ pay schemes, Act 10 included a
number of other provisions, some of which directly affected teachers. In theory, these provisions
were applied uniformly across the state. In practice, however, they could have differentially impacted districts depending on districts’ characteristics. For example, the weakening of teachers’
unions could have affected a district’s pay scheme and teacher sorting differently depending on
ex ante union strength. Similarly, increases in employees’ contributions to health care and retirement plans and a reduction in state aid could have led districts to reallocate their budget across
different items and to offer health care plans of different quality, and this could have directly
affected teacher sorting (D’Andrea, 2013).
Appendix Table A1 shows that expenditure on different budget items and measures of union
strength (such as indicators for whether the district had a union election in each year and
whether the union managed to recertify) were very similar across FP and SP districts, both before and after Act 10.18 Furthermore, the bounding exercise of Altonji et al. (2005) indicates only
a small role for unobservables (Section 5). This exercise allows me to quantify the role of unobservables under the assumption that the variation in the outcome variable that is driven by
17
For example, if districts place the highest priority on seniority, they might be more likely to stay SP. If they place
a higher value on attributes not rewarded by a standard schedule, they might be more likely to switch to FP.
18
Appendix Figure A4 shows the 2012–2016 trends in the share of FP and SP districts which held a union election in
each year and in which the union successfully re-certified. Trends in various budget items across FP and SP districts
are shown in Appendix Figure A3.

unobservables and the variation driven by observables have the same relationship with the type
of post-Act 10 pay structure. Overall, these tests suggest that the bulk of the difference in postAct 10 outcomes can be attributed to differences in pay schemes, as opposed to other provisions
of the Act.

Notes: Means, differences in means, and standard errors (in parentheses) of district-level characteristics in
FP and SP districts (columns 1) and in matched FP and SP districts (columns 2). The FP subsample includes 102 districts; the SP subsample includes 122 districts. The subsample covers 83 percent of the total
student population. The matched sample of SP districts is obtained via nearest-neighbor matching on observable characteristics of the school districts and includes 56 districts.

12

(which could indicate the presence of time-varying unobservables), all my empirical tests are
accompanied by time-varying estimates of the parameters of interest. In addition, I control for
the ex ante differences in observables in a flexible way, interacting their pre-Act 10 (2009–2011)
averages with year fixed effects.19 Lastly, I complement my results with those obtained using a
matched sample, constructed to smooth the small ex ante differences in observables between FP
and SP districts (Table 1).20 I build the sample using nearest-neighbor matching with replacement (Abadie and Imbens, 2011). I match each FP with a SP district on the basis of 2009–2011
district attributes, including enrollment, the share of low-SES students, average teacher salaries
(for all teachers and for those with less than five years of experience), the share of teachers with
less than three years of experience, the share of teachers with more than 20 years of experience,
the share of teachers with a master’s degree, the location of the district (urban, suburban, rural),
property values, expenditure, and state aid per pupil.21 The final sample contains 102 FP and 56
SP districts (Table 1, column 2).22

Data and Measurement
The main data set contains information on the universe of Wisconsin teachers, linked with

student test scores to calculate teacher VA. I combine it with information on post-Act 10 salary
structures for each district, drawn from employee handbooks. Lastly, I use school- and districtlevel characteristics as controls and to construct the matched sample. Data are reported by
academic year, referenced using the calendar year of the spring semester (e.g. 2007 for 2006-07).
Teacher Data. I draw information on the population of Wisconsin teachers from the PI-1202 Fall
Staff Report - All Staff Files for the years 2007–2015, made available by the Wisconsin Department
of Public Instruction (WDPI). These files contain information on all individuals employed by
the WDPI in each year and include personal and demographic information, education, years of
teaching experience, and characteristics of job assignments (including total salary, grades and
subject taught, full-time equivalency (FTE) units, and school and district identifiers). I restrict
19

Appendix Figure A2 shows no evidence of differential pre-trends in these observables across the two groups of
districts in the years leading to Act 10.
20
Despite these differences in means, Appendix Figure A13 shows that the distributions of these characteristics are
very similar across the two groups of districts.
21
Since the sample is with replacement, matched SP districts are counted multiple times if they serve as controls for
more than one district. Appendix Table A3 shows estimates of the probit model underlying the matching procedure.
22
Appendix Figure A14 shows that the distributions of a set of district characteristics across FP and matched
SP districts appear very similar; a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test fails to reject the null hypothesis of equality in the
distribution of all variables at the 5 percent confidence level.

the sample to non-substitute, tenured teachers working in FP and SP districts.23 Salaries are
expressed in 2015 dollars and in FTE units.24
School and District Data. School-level data from the Wisconsin Information System for Education (WISE) include total enrollment and the share of economically disadvantaged, Black,
and Hispanic students. District-level covariates include equalized property values from the
WDPI (used to calculate property tax levies) and indicators for whether the district is located
in an urban, suburban, or rural area.25 Budget data from the WDPI include revenues by source
and expenditures by item, for all districts and for the years 2008–2015. Lastly, information on
union election outcomes is from the records of the Wisconsin Employment Relation Commission
(WERC).
Student Test Scores and Demographics. Student-level data include math and reading test scores
from the Wisconsin Knowledge and Concepts Examination (WKCE, 2007–2014) and Badger test
(2015–2016), for all students in grades 3 to 8, as well as demographic characteristics such as
gender, race and ethnicity, socio-economic (SES) status, migration status, English-learner status,
and disability. The WKCE was administered in November of each school year, whereas the
Badger test was administered in the spring. To account for this change, for the years 2007–2014
I assign each student a score equal to the average of the standardized scores for the current and
the following year.
Employee Handbooks and Salary Schedules. I collected information on districts’ pay schemes
from their 2015 employee handbooks, available for 224 out of 422 districts (including seven high
school districts), which enroll approximately 83 percent of all students.26 I classify a district as
SP for the entire post-Act 10 period if its 2015 handbook contains a salary schedule and does not
mention rewards for performance or merit and as FP otherwise. If a schedule is published but
bonuses linked to performance are mentioned, the district is classified as FP.27
23

I exclude long- and short-term substitute teachers, teaching assistants and other support staff, and contracted
employees since salaries for these workers are calculated differently from those of permanent teachers.
24
Due to evident mistakes in the reporting of salary information, I discard information for teachers in the school
district of Kenosha, as well as for those in the school district of Milwaukee for the year 2015.
25
These variables are based on the US Census urban-rural classification.
26
Handbooks are published on each district’s website. Unclassified districts (i.e., those for which handbooks are
not available) either do not have a website or do not make their handbook public. Appendix Table A6 compares FP
and SP districts with unclassified districts. The latter are smaller, enroll more disadvantaged students, pay lower
salaries, and are disproportionately located in rural areas.
27
It is possible that districts classified as FP did not change pay scheme immediately after the passage of Act 10,
but after a few years. By the same token, it is possible that districts classified as SP as of 2015 switched to FP after
2015. For this reason I end my analysis in 2015.

3.1

Measurement: Teacher Value-Added
I measure teacher quality using value-added (VA), defined as the teacher’s effect on test

scores conditional on other determinants of achievement (such as past test scores, student demographics, and school fixed effects; Hanushek, 1971; Rockoff, 2004; Rivkin et al., 2005; Chetty
et al., 2014a). Albeit not a perfect measure of talent (Rothstein, 2010; Kraft, 2017; Jackson, 2018),
VA is generally considered a good signal of a teacher’s effectiveness (Kane and Staiger, 2008;
Chetty et al., 2014a).
VA is usually estimated using datasets that make it possible to link teachers to the pupils
they taught through classroom identifiers. Information on students’ and teachers’ classroom
was not maintained by the WDPI before 2017. This implies that I can link a teacher to all the
students enrolled in her school and grade in a given year, but not to the specific students she
taught.
To obtain a measure of teacher effectiveness in the presence of this data limitation I leverage
the identification approach of Rivkin et al. (2005), who face the same issue using data from Texas.
I then combine this approach with the estimation method of Chetty et al. (2014a). The starting
point is the following model of achievement:
A⇤kt = Xkt + ⌫kt

(1)

where ⌫kt = µi(kt)t + ✓c(kt) + "kt ,
A⇤kt is a standardized measure of test scores for student k in year t, Xkt is a vector of student and
school-specific controls, and i(kt) denotes student k’s teacher in t. VA is the estimate of µi(kt)t ,
the teacher-specific component of test score residuals. Chetty et al. (2014a) use the following
estimator:

µ̂it =

ˆm Āim

Essentially, µ̂it is the best linear predictor of Āit , the average test score residuals of teacher i’s
students in year t, given test score residuals from the previous l years. When teachers and
students can only be linked up to the grade level, constructing Āit is not possible. The best
approximation is an average of test score residuals for all students in teacher i’s grade and school
in year t:
Āgit =

Akt

k:g e (it)=g p (kt),se (it)=sp (kt)

where g e (it) (se (it)) is the grade (school) where teacher i teaches in year t, g p (kt) (sp (kt)) is the
grade (school) attended by student k in year t, and Ngst is the number of students in grade g and

Identification. How can we identify a teacher’s effect if we cannot precisely link her to the students she taught? The identification argument follows Rivkin et al. (2005) and relies on teacher
turnover across grades and/or across schools. In the absence of turnover, all teachers in the same
grade and school would be assigned the same average residual every year, and distinguishing
their individual effects would be impossible. With multiple years of data and in the presence of
turnover, however, teacher switches across schools, or within schools and across grades, allow
me to isolate the effect of the individual teacher through the comparison of test score residuals
before and after her arrival in a given grade and school. Importantly, teacher turnover makes it
possible to more precisely identify not only the effects of the teacher who switches, but also the
effects of all other teachers in her same grade and school at any point in time.28 Appendix B.1
illustrates the identification argument with a simple example.
Limitations of VA Estimates and a Validation Exercise. Because students are linked to teachers
at the grade-school level, and because not all teachers switch grade or school, VA of a teacher
could also be a function of test scores of students she never taught. This will introduce measurement error in the estimates. In addition, VA of teachers who are always in the same grade-school
28

The aggregation of test scores at the grade level also overcomes one of the most problematic form of selection,
which occurs within schools and grades and across classrooms (Rivkin et al., 2005). The (forced) use of grade-school
estimates circumvents this form of selection and is in practice equivalent to an instrumental variable estimator based
on grade rather than classroom assignment.

16

will never be separately identifiable (and each of them would be assigned an average of their
true effects).
Classical measurement error would undermine the efficiency of the parameter estimates
(when used as the dependent variable) or generate attenuation bias (when used as an explanatory variable). This noise, however, can be even more problematic when it is non-classical, i.e.,
correlated with other variables in a model. This could happen, for example, if estimates are more
precise for teachers who move and if movements are not random (e.g. they could be correlated
with a district’s pay scheme).
To assess the performance of my measures relative to standard estimates, I use data from
New York City (NYC) teachers and students, which include classroom links. I estimate VA using the standard approach (which exploits classroom links, CL hereafter) as well the approach
described above, which links students to teachers on the basis of grade and school (GL hereafter). A comparison of these two sets of estimates reveals the following facts.
1. Although less precise than CL, GL still explains a substantial portion of the variance in
test scores. In the NYC data, the standard deviation of VA for math teachers is 0.19 for CL and
0.11 for GL (Appendix Figure B1). In the Wisconsin data, the standard deviation of GL is 0.08
for math (Appendix Figure B2).
2. GL is a forecast-unbiased estimator of CL. Forecast bias can be defined as f = 1

in the

Appendix Figure B3 shows the linear relationship between

CL and GL; the estimated bias (one minus the slope of the fit line) is equal to 0.05 and it is
indistinguishable from zero.
3. GL is a forecast-unbiased estimator of a teacher’s future student achievement. Using
teacher switches as a quasi-experiment, as in Chetty et al. (2014a), yields an estimated bias of
0.05 for GL (Appendix Table B1).
4. The difference between CL and GL is uncorrelated with student or teacher observables (including the probability of turnover) in the NYC data (Appendix Table B2), mitigating concerns
for non-classical measurement error. Clearly, this test cannot be performed with the Wisconsin data. While this result plausibly applies for VA estimated before Act 10 (when teachers’
turnover was arguably more random), it might not hold after 2011 (when sorting could happen
in response to a change in pay). I discuss the implications of non-classical measurement error
along with the description of my results (Section 6).
VA estimates are available for 20,370 teachers of math and reading in grades 4 to 8, including

17

the final sample of 16,862 tenured teachers in 98 FP and 119 SP districts serving elementary and
middle schools (see Appendix Table A4 for a summary).29
My empirical analyses use two measures of VA. The first is ex ante VA, calculated as the
average teacher effect for the years 2007–2011. This measure is constructed to parse out any
effects of Act 10 on effort and to focus on selection. The second is a time-varying measure,
allowed to vary before and after Act 10 for each teacher and used to study changes in effort.
By construction, ex ante VA is only available for the subsample of teachers who were already
in the system before 2011. While this does not affect the estimation of VA per se (which uses
information on all teachers in a given grade and year), analyses of teacher selection will be
based on this (possibly selected) subset of teachers. Appendix Table A5 compares teachers with
and without ex ante VA on the basis of observables. Perhaps not surprisingly, teachers with ex
ante VA have higher experience. Their ex post VA, however, is not statistically different from that
of teachers without ex ante VA.

Salary Responses to Act 10
Act 10 gave districts considerable flexibility over the design of teacher pay. I start my empir-

ical analysis by quantifying how salaries changed in FP and SP districts in the aftermath of the
reform. I focus on two metrics: the degree of pay dispersion among teachers with similar experience and education and the relationship between salaries and teacher quality, measured with
VA. Appendix Figure A6 plots the full distribution of salaries in FP and SP districts between
2007 and 2015.
Dispersion in Salaries. Figure 1 shows median salaries and 90-10 percentile ranges by two-year
experience classes and for teachers with a master’s degree in two large and comparable urban
districts: Racine (top panel), a SP district, and Green Bay (bottom panel), a FP district.30
Before Act 10, the salary distribution was very similar across the two districts (although
base salaries were lower in Green Bay). The median salary for teachers with five or six years
of experience was equal to $54,337 in Racine (with a 90-10 percentile range of $10,308) and to
$47,799 in Green Bay (with a range of $5,962). For teachers with 11 or 12 years of experience the
median was $66,285 in Racine (with a range of $11,205) and $59,452 in Green Bay (with a range
29
VA estimates are not available for teachers in seven high school districts, since standardized test scores are not
administered in high school. Although most of the empirical analysis is restricted to tenured teachers, VA is calculated for all teachers.
30
The two districts are comparable in size, enrolling 20,514 and 20,457 students in 2012, respectively.

of $9,426).
After Act 10, the difference in salary dispersion between the two districts becomes striking
(bottom panel). The 90-10 percentile range for teachers with five or six years of experience was
equal to $7,923 in Racine and $13,127 in Green Bay. For teachers with 11 or 12 years of experience
it was $10,739 in Racine and $11,088 in Green Bay. No differences in salary dispersion can be
observed for teachers with higher levels of experience.
To more systematically quantify the increase in dispersion across all FP and SP districts,
Figure 2 shows the trend in the FP-SP difference in the quartile coefficient of dispersion (QCD),
defined as the difference between the 75th and 25th percentile of salaries divided by its sum,
and calculated within each district and for teachers with similar experience and education. This
measure is meant to capture the dispersion in salaries in a way that is insensitive to changes in
the salary levels. The FP-SP difference in QCD is flat and indistinguishable from zero between
2007 and 2011; it increases to 0.3 percent in 2012, remaining at this level until 2015.31 This finding
is robust to using other measures of dispersion, such as the coefficient of variation. The increase
in pay dispersion indicates that the departure from a salary schedule regime in FP districts led
to teachers with the same experience and education earning different salaries. This suggests
that FP districts used their newly-acquired flexibility to compensate teachers for attributes not
rewarded by a standard lock-step schedule.
To understand the extent to which the observed increase in pay dispersion is driven by
changes in salaries of incumbent teachers (i.e. teachers who were already in the district in the
previous year) as opposed to changes in salaries offered to new hires, I re-estimate the FP-SP
difference in QCD solely on the subsample of incumbents. While imprecisely estimated, the
post-Act 10 increase in this difference is smaller than the one in the full sample but greater than
zero (Figure 2, dashed line). This indicates that the post-Act 10 increase in pay dispersion is
driven by both changes in salaries for new hires and pay renegotiation for incumbent teachers.
Salaries and Teacher Quality. What drove the post-Act 10 increase in salary dispersion in FP
districts? To answer this question, the ideal test would estimate the correlation between pay
and those teacher attributes, not rewarded under seniority pay, which districts may want to
compensate under a FP scheme, including (but not limited to) preparedness, progress, leadership, and professional development. Most of these attributes, however, are only observable to
principals and other school administrators and are difficult to measure. I hence settle on a more
31

Trends in the raw QCD for FP and SP districts are shown in Appendix Figure A7.

Notes: Point estimates and 90 percent confidence intervals of the FP-SP difference in the median QCD

and education in each district and year. QCDs are calculated as the ratio between the difference and the
sum of the 75th and 25th percentiles of salaries, computed separately for each group of teachers. The
sample is restricted to tenured teachers (with more than three years of experience) working in FP, SP,
and matched SP districts. The matched sample of SP districts is obtained via nearest-neighbor matching
on observable characteristics of the school districts. The sample of incumbents contains teachers already
teaching in the district in the previous year.

modest task and study the correlation between salaries and teacher VA, conditional on experience and education. While districts do not observe nor explicitly use VA to evaluate teachers,
this measure could be correlated with other attributes that districts can observe and value.
I estimate this correlation using the following model:

log(wijt ) =

0V

Ait + V Ait ⇤ postt + Xitw + ✓j + ⌧t + "ijt

(5)

where wijt is the salary earned by teacher i in district j and year t, V Ait is teacher VA (calculated
as the average over the years 2007–2011 and 2012–2015, and standardized to have mean 0 and
variance 1), and the variable postt equals one for the years 2012–2015. The vector Xitw controls for
experience and education in a flexible way, and it includes a non-parametric function of years of
experience, interacted with indicators for the highest education degree and with a dummy for
years after 2011 (to allow the gradient between salaries, experience, and education to vary after
Act 10). The vector of district fixed effects ✓j controls for district-specific differences in salaries
and the vector of year fixed effects ⌧t controls for time trends in a non-parametric way. I estimate
the equation using OLS, and I calculate bootstrapped standard errors (to account for the fact that

21

VA is an estimated variable) clustered at the district level. In this specification, the coefficient

0

captures the conditional correlation between salaries and VA before 2011, while the parameter
captures the change in this correlation after 2011.
In the sample of FP districts, the conditional correlation between salary and VA is indistinguishable from zero until 2011 (with an estimate of

0

equal to -0.0008, Table 2, column 1, p-value

equal to 0.71), and it becomes positive and significant after 2011 (with an estimate of

equal to

0.005, Table 2, column 1, significant at 5 percent). This implies that a one-standard deviation
higher VA is associated with a 0.5 percent higher salary. In the full and matched samples of SP
districts, estimates of

and 0.2 percent respectively, Table 2, columns 2 and 3). Estimates of

Notes: The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of salaries. The variable VA is teacher VA, normalized to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1. The variable post equals 1 for years following 2011.
All the regressions include year and district fixed effects, as well as indicators for years of experience
interacted with indicators for highest education degree interacted with post. VA is calculated as the average of a time-varying measure over the years 2007–2011 and 2012–2015. The sample is restricted to
tenured teachers (with more than three years of experience) working in FP, SP, and matched SP districts,
and it covers years 2007 to 2015. In columns 4-6, the sample is further restricted to include teachers with
less than 10 years of experience. The matched sample of SP districts is obtained via nearest-neighbor
matching on observable characteristics of the school districts. Bootstrapped standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the district level. *** p < .01, ** p < .05, * p < .1.

check for the existence of pre-trends, I estimate the parameter separately for each year between
2008 and 2015 and for FP and SP districts. These estimates, shown in Figure 3, are indistinguishable from zero and very similar across both groups of districts in the years 2008–2011. In line
with Table 2, estimates become positive and statistically significant in FP districts after 2011,
reaching 0.5 percent in 2013 (Figure 3, solid line). They instead remain indistinguishable from
zero in SP districts until 2015 (Figure 3, dashed line).

includes a non-parametric

dummy for years after 2011. The vector ✓j contains district fixed effects and the vector ⌧t contains year
fixed effects. The coefficients s are estimated separately for FP and SP districts. VA is calculated as the
average of a time-varying measure over the years 2007–2011 and 2012–2015. The sample is restricted to
tenured teachers (with more than three years of experience) working in FP and SP districts. Bootstrapped
standard errors are clustered at the district level.

Appendix Figure A9 shows the semi-parametric relationship between salaries and VA, captured by the pre- vs. post-Act 10 difference in conditional salaries by deciles of VA. In FP districts, teachers in the top decile earn approximately 2.5 percent more than teachers in the bottom
decile (significant at 1 percent), whereas in SP districts they earn only 1.1 percent more (significant at 10 percent). The correlation between conditional salaries and VA is highest for teachers
with four or five years of experience in FP districts (2.3 percent, significant at 1 percent), whereas
it is indistinguishable from zero for teachers with more than 10 years of experience in FP districts
and for all teachers in SP districts (Appendix Figure A10).
Although positive, estimates of are small in magnitude, and at a first glance it might seem
hard to believe that such small salary premia produce any change in teacher behavior at all.

23

It should be emphasized, however, that districts do not use VA when making decisions over
teacher pay. Interviews with FP districts’ administrators reveal that their post-Act 10 schemes
are designed to reward teachers for a number of attributes, including (but not limited to) their
preparation, leadership, learning, and professional development.33 If these characteristics have
a positive but small correlation with VA, this could result in low estimates of due to attenuation
bias.34 In light of this, the estimates of

should be interpreted as suggestive evidence that

districts use their post-Act 10 pay flexibility to reward teacher characteristics that are, at least
to some extent, positively correlated with VA, rather than as true estimates of the actual salary
premia enjoyed by teachers under the new payment scheme.

Movements, Exits, and Changes in Workforce Composition
The cross-district differences in salaries that arose in the aftermath of Act 10 changed teach-

ers’ job prospects. A simple Roy model (Roy, 1951, outlined in Appendix C) predicts that a
switch to a FP regime in some (but not all) districts would induce high-quality teachers to move
from SP to FP districts and low-quality teachers to either move in the opposite direction or to
leave the market. The intuition behind this result is that a SP scheme under-compensates highquality teachers relative to a FP scheme, whereas a FP scheme penalizes low-quality teachers. I
test these predictions by studying teachers’ movements across districts and exits from this labor
market.

5.1

Movements Across Districts
Teacher movements increased rapidly in the aftermath of Act 10, across districts of different

type (i.e. from FP to SP and vice versa), as well as within districts of the same type (Figure 4).
Moving rates (defined as the ratio between the number of teachers moving to a certain type of
district and the total number of teachers in the type of district of origin) increased from 1.8 to 4.3
percent from SP to FP, and from 2.0 to 3.9 percent from FP to SP. Similarly, movements between
SP districts increased from 2.0 to 3.9 percent and movements between FP districts increased
33

From interviews with superintendents of a subset of 12 FP and SP districts, conducted in December 2017.
Papay and Kraft (2015) show that professional development is associated with improvements in teacher quality.
Dobbie (2011) demonstrates that teacher leadership is a good predictor of future student test scores among Teach for
America corps members. Jackson et al. (2014) provide a review of the literature on teacher attributed associated with
VA. In Appendix Table A9, I also test whether FP districts pay higher salaries to teachers in subjects that usually experience teacher shortages, such as math and science, conditional on experience, education, and VA. These estimates
do not show significant premia for teachers in these subjects.

from 2.4 to 4.7 percent.35
Although the post-Act 10 increase in moving rates is fairly similar across types of districts,
the characteristics of movers could be different. For example, the introduction of a FP regime
(which rewards quality) could have induced higher VA teachers to move from SP to FP districts
and lower VA teachers to move in the opposite direction. To test this hypothesis I study whether
the probability of moving to a district of a given type (conditional on the district of origin) differs
between high- and low-quality teachers. I use the following models:

where M oveF Pikjt equals one if teacher i moves from a district k to a district j of type F P in
year t, and M oveSPikjt equals one if teacher i moves from a district k to a district j of type SP
in year t.36 The variable highV Ai equals one for teachers with ex ante value added above the
median. The vector Xit includes indicators for the number of years of experience interacted
with indicators for the highest education degree. The vector Zjt controls for characteristics of
the district of destination, such as an array of pre-Act 10 teacher, student, and district attributes
35

Such a large increase in movements within districts of the same type might appear surprising. Consider, however, that the overall increase in movements and exits after Act 10 led to a surge in vacancies. This could have
induced some teachers to move between districts of the same type for reasons not strictly related to salaries. The empirical evidence on movements across districts of the same type does not show clear patterns of sorting with respect
to quality.

recertification election in year t and whether the election was successful.37 The vector ✓k includes fixed effects for the district of origin. I estimate the model via OLS separately for teachers
working in FP and SP districts in the previous year, and I cluster standard errors at the level
of the district of origin. The coefficients

probability of moving to a FP or SP district, respectively, for high-quality teachers relative to
low-quality ones.

Notes: The dependent variable equals 1 for teachers who move to a FP district (columns 1-2),
move to a SP district (column 3-4), exit from a FP district (column 5), and exit from a SP district (column 6). In columns 1 and 4 the sample is restricted to teachers already working in
a SP district; in columns 2 and 3 it is restricted to those already working in a FP district. The
variable high VA equals one for teachers with ex ante VA above the median. The variable post
equals one for years after Act 10. All the regressions include year and district fixed effects.
District controls include interactions between 2009–2011 averages of district characteristics
interacted with year fixed effects. CB controls include an indicator for whether the district
had a union recertification election in year t and whether the election was successful. Teacher
controls include indicators for the number of years of experience and for the highest education degree. Columns 5 and 6 control non-parametrically for age. Ex ante VA is calculated as
the average of a time-varying measure over the years 2007–2011. The sample is restricted to
tenured teachers (with more than three years of experience) working in FP and SP districts,
and covers years 2008 to 2015 (columns 1-4) and years 2008 to 2012 (columns 5-6). Standard
errors in parentheses are clustered at the district level. *** p < .01, ** p < .05, * p < .1.
37

Pre-Act 10 characteristics include the 2009–2011 averages of enrollment, share of low-SES students, salary for
all teachers and for teachers with less than five years of experience, property values per pupil, indicators for urban
and suburban districts, total expenditure and state aid per pupil, share of teachers with a master’s degree, share of
teachers with less than three years of experience, and share of teachers with more than 20 years of experience.

26

OLS estimates indicate sorting of high-quality teachers from SP to FP districts and sorting of
low-quality teachers from FP to SP districts. Teachers in SP districts with VA above the median
were 0.34 percentage points more likely to move to a FP district after Act 10 compared with
teachers with VA below the median (estimate of high VA * post, Table 3, column 1, significant
at 10 percent). Compared with an average moving rate from SP to FP of 0.27 percent in 20082011, this corresponds to a 113 percent increase. In contrast, high-quality teachers in FP districts
are -0.50 percentage points less likely to move to a SP district after Act 10 compared with lowVA teachers, or -167 percent (Table 3, column 3, significant at 1 percent). Higher VA teachers
are only 0.13 percentage points more likely to move across FP districts (Table 3, column 1, pvalue equal to 0.42) and-0.30 percentage points less likely to move across SP districts (Table 3,
column 4, significant at 10 percent). Estimates are robust to excluding Milwaukee and Madison
(Appendix Table A10) and to using the matched sample (Appendix Table A11).
To investigate the presence of pre-trends, in Figure 5 I allow

FP

and

SP

to vary over time

between 2008 and 2015, normalizing them to zero in 2011. Time-specific estimates of

FP

on

the subsample of teachers working in SP districts are very close to zero between 2008 and 2010,
confirming the absence of pre-trends; they become positive and significant after 2011, reaching
0.4 percentage points in 2012 (significant at 5 percent). Estimates of

SP

on the subsample of

teachers working in F P districts are also indistinguishable from zero between 2008 and 2010,
and they become negative after 2011, dropping to -0.9 percentage points in 2014 (significant at 5
percent).
As an additional test of sorting, in columns 1 and 2 of Table 4 I estimate the post-Act 10
difference in VA between movers to FP districts and movers to SP districts. I use the following
empirical model on the subsample of teachers who move across districts in each year:

is average ex ante VA of teacher i, who moves from district k to district j in year

t. The coefficient

captures the post-Act 10 change in VA of movers to FP districts after Act 10,

conditional on the district of origin and relative to movers to SP districts.
OLS estimates of

on the full sample of FP and SP districts indicate that, after Act 10 and

conditional on the district of origin (captured by F Pk and its interactions with F Pj and postt ),

27

movers to FP districts have a 0.36 standard deviations higher VA compared with movers to SP
districts (Table 4, column 1, significant at 10 percent). The estimate is robust to controlling for
various school district budget items, including per-teacher expenditure on salaries, retirement,
and health and other insurance, as well as total per-student expenditure and state aid (0.37 standard deviations, Table 4, column 2, significant at 10 percent). Estimates on the matched sample
are similar in magnitude, although less precise (0.27 and 0.31 standard deviations, Appendix
Table A11, columns 1-2, p-values equal to 0.40 and 0.40, respectively).
The findings presented so far are in line with the theoretical predictions of a simple Roy
model: After Act 10, high-quality teachers sort into FP districts and low-quality teachers sort
into SP districts.
Salaries of Movers. The Roy model implies that the observed cross-district sorting patterns
are driven by higher salaries in the district of destination. To provide evidence in line with this
prediction, I conduct an event study of post-Act 10 changes in salaries (conditional on experience

Notes: The dependent variable is ex ante teacher VA. Columns 1-2 and 5-6 are estimated on the subsample of movers to a district; columns 3-4 are estimated on the subsample of leavers from a district (defined
as teachers who leave Wisconsin’s teaching workforce). The variable FP equals one for FP districts. The
variable post equals one for years following 2011. All the regressions include year fixed effects. District
controls include interactions between the 2009–2011 averages of district characteristics interacted with
year fixed effects. CB controls include an indicator for whether the district had a union recertification election in year t and whether the election was successful. Teacher controls include indicators for the number

OLS estimates of the vector

k,

shown in Figure 6, indicate that high-quality movers to FP

districts experienced a significant 4.5 percent conditional salary increase in the year after a move,
compared with similar teachers who moved before Act 10 (Figure 6, Panel A, solid line, significant at 5 percent). Notably, no trends in salary differences can be observed in the years leading
to a move. This premium persists up to three years following a move. Low-quality teachers,
on the other hand, did not experience any significant change in salaries after moving to a FP
district after Act 10 (Figure 6, Panel A, dashed line). Similarly, high-quality and low-quality
movers to SP districts experienced no differential change in post-move salaries after Act 10 (Figure 6, Panel B). Estimates on the matched sample are very similar (Appendix Figure A15). These
findings provide suggestive evidence that, in the aftermath of Act 10, high-quality teachers were
attracted to FP districts by the prospect of higher salaries.

Exit from Public Schools
The increase in movements of teachers across districts after Act 10 was accompanied by a

surge in exits (Figure 7).39 In 2011, 2.1 percent and 2.7 percent of teachers left FP and SP districts
in each year, respectively. In 2012, these rates increased to 4.0 and 4.9 percent.40
Figure 7: Exit Rates, by District of Origin

Notes: Share of teachers leaving Wisconsin public schools, by type of district of origin.

Although trends in exit rates appear similar across the two groups of districts, the characteristics of the teachers who left could be different. For example, the introduction of quality pay
in FP districts could have induced low-quality teachers to exit at a higher rate compared with
high-quality teachers. To test this hypothesis I estimate the following equation:

eijt =

0 highV

Ai + highV Ai ⇤ postt +

e
1 Xit

+

2 Zjt

+ ✓j + ⌧t + "ijt

(10)

where eijt equals one if teacher i leaves the market from district j in year t. The vector Xite
includes indicators for the highest education degree, as well as a non-parametric control for age
and experience interacted with an indicator for years after 2011, to account for a differential
propensity to retire after Act 10 (Roth, 2017; Biasi, 2017). Since the bulk of retirement occurred
in 2012 I estimate this equation on the years 2008–2012, separately for teachers in FP and SP
districts.
39

Exit rates are defined as the share of individuals who disappear from the records of employees in Wisconsin
public schools. Reasons for exiting include retirement, dropping out of the labor force, or a move to a to private
school or to another industry/occupation. The staff data does not allow me me to observe a teacher after she leaves,
and I am thus unable to distinguish among these reasons.
40
The spike in exits is partly due to a surge in retirement (Roth, 2017; Biasi, 2017): exit rates of teachers above age
55 increased from 6.2 to 10.2 percent in FP districts and from 7.8 to 13.0 percent in SP districts. However, they also
increased for teachers below age 55, from 0.8 to 1.5 percent in FP districts and from 1.1 to 1.8 percent in SP districts.

the election was successful, and ✓j are district fixed effects. The parameter 2011 is normalized to equal
zero. Standard errors are clustered at the district level.

OLS estimates of

(shown in Table 3) indicate that, after Act 10, teachers with VA below

the median were 1.8 percentage points more likely to exit from a FP district compared with
teachers with VA above the median (with an estimate of high VA * post equal to -0.018, Table 3,
column 5, significant at 10 percent). Compared with an average exit rate of 4.1 percent percent
for FP districts in 2007-2011, this corresponds to a 44 percent increase in this probability. By
comparison, this estimate is indistinguishable from zero in the full sample of SP districts (0.0055, Table 3, column 5, p-value equal to 0.38) and in matched SP districts (-0.0093, Table
A11, column 6, p-value equal to 0.33).41 Year-specific estimates of

for the years 2008–2011,

shown in Figure 8, are very close to zero for both FP and SP districts, confirming the absence of
pre-trends. They become negative and significant in 2012 in FP districts (with an estimate of -2.0
percentage points, significant at 10 percent).
To quantify the overall change in VA for teachers who exit from SP and FP districts, I estimate
the following model on the subsample of leavers:

The coefficient

captures the post-Act 10 difference in VA of leavers from FP districts relative

to SP, conditional on the district of origin. Estimates on the full sample of FP and SP districts
indicate that, after Act 10, VA of leavers from FP districts was 0.18 standard deviations smaller
than VA of leavers from SP districts (Table 4, column 4, significant at 5 percent). Estimates on
the subsample of matched FP and SP districts are even larger in magnitude, with -0.26 standard
deviations (Appendix Table A12, column 8, significant at 1 percent). Taken together, these results indicate a disproportionate exit of low-quality teachers from FP districts compared with
SP districts after Act 10.

capture the post-Act 10 difference in salaries of leavers in the year

immediately preceding their exit.
OLS estimates of , shown in Table 5, indicate that teachers with VA above the median who
left FP districts after Act 10 experienced a small and insignificant change in salary right before
leaving, compared with similar teachers who exited before Act 10 (0.0019, Table 5, column 1, pvalue equal to 0.95). Teachers with VA below the median, on the other hand, experienced a large
2.7 percent decline in salary (Table 5, column 2, significant at 1 percent). In SP districts, high VA
leavers experienced a 1.3 percent salary decline after Act 10 (Table 5, column 3, significant at 1
percent), whereas low VA teachers experienced no significant change (Table 5, column 4). These
estimates are robust to using the matched sample (columns 5-6). These findings are consistent
with the Roy model, which predicts that the disproportionate exits of low-quality teachers from
FP districts and of high-quality teachers from SP districts are driven by lower salaries.

Composition of the Teaching Workforce
Movements of teachers across districts and exits from the market directly affect the compo-

sition of the teaching workforce. To quantify this change, I compare ex ante teacher VA in FP and
SP districts before and after the passage of Act 10. I estimate:

Notes: The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of salaries. The variable exit equals one for
teachers exiting from a district in the following year. The variable post equals one for years following
2011. All the regressions include controls for a non-parametric function of years of experience, interacted with indicators for the highest education degree and with post, as well as district and year fixed
effects. The sample is restricted to tenured teachers (with more than three years of experience) working in FP (columns 1-2), SP (columns 3-4), and matched SP districts (columns 5-6) and covers years
2008 to 2015. Columns 1, 3, and 5 refer to teachers with ex ante VA above the median; columns 2, 4,
and 6 refer to teachers with VA below the median. The matched sample of SP districts is obtained
via nearest-neighbor matching on observable characteristics of the school districts. Standard errors in

The parameter

captures the change in VA in FP relative to SP districts after Act 10. Es-

, shown in Table 6, indicate that ex ante teacher VA increased by 0.048 standard

deviations in FP districts compared with SP after Act 10 (Table 6, column 1, significant at 10
percent). This estimate increases to 0.069 standard deviations with the inclusion of controls
for teacher experience and education, for the district’s budget composition, and for measures
of union strength (column 3), and they are slightly smaller when controlling for district fixed
effects (column 4).
To gauge the extent to which the difference in teacher VA between FP and SP districts is due
to unobservables, I estimate an upper bound for the bias in

driven by unobservables using

the methodology of Altonji et al. (2005). This method relies on the condition that the portion
of a district’s average VA that is related to unobservables and the portion that is related to the
observables included as controls in column (3) have the same relationship with the type of postAct 10 pay structure. This exercise yields an upper bound for this bias equal to 0.005 standard
deviations, which implies that at most seven percent of the estimated compositional change can

34

be attributed to time-varying unobservable differences between FP and SP districts.42
Estimates on the matched sample of FP and SP districts yield similar results (Table 6, columns
5-8). Time-varying estimates of

They become positive after 2011, with 0.058 in 2012 (significant at 10 percent) and remain high
at this level through 2015.43

Notes: The dependent variable is ex ante teacher VA. The variable FP equals 1 for FP districts. The variable post equals one for years following 2011. All the regressions include year fixed effects. District
controls include interactions between the 2009–2011 averages of district characteristics interacted with
year fixed effects. CB controls include an indicator for whether the district had a union recertification
election in year t and whether the election was successful. Teacher controls include indicators for the
number of years of experience and for the highest education degree. Budget controls are district-yearlevel controls for the level of state aid as a share of total revenues, as well as per-teacher expenditure
on salaries, retirement, health, life, and other insurance, and other employee benefits. Ex ante VA is
calculated as the average of a time-varying measure over the years 2007–2011. The sample is restricted
to tenured teachers (with more than three years of experience) working in FP, SP, and matched SP districts, and it covers years 2008 to 2015. The matched sample of SP districts is obtained via nearestneighbor matching on observable characteristics of the school districts. Standard errors in parentheses
are clustered at the district level. *** p < .01, ** p < .05, * p < .1.

This approach relies on estimating the parameter ⇢ as defined by Altonji et al. (2005), which represents the
correlation between the unobservable component of the independent variable of interest (in this case, FP*post) and
the unobservable component of the dependent variable. This parameter can be estimated using the estimates of a
regression of Equation (13) (including all the controls) and a regression of FP*post on the controls, as in Altonji et al.
(2005). I estimate ⇢ to be equal to 0.13.
43
Estimates of the difference in linear pre-trends between FP and SP districts are small and statistically indistinguishable from zero (the results are available upon request). Trends in raw VA are shown in Appendix Figure A11.

35

It should be noted, at this point, that the above analysis does not include new teachers,
for whom VA cannot be calculated. Appendix Figure A16 (top panel) shows that entry rates
(defined as the share of new teachers in the population) declined between 2008 and 2011 and
increased after Act 10 in both types of districts, possibly due to an increase in the number of
vacancies to be filled. If Act 10 induced better or more motivated teachers to enter the market
in FP districts, the estimates described so far would represent a lower bound of the true compositional change (Hoxby and Leigh, 2004; Rothstein, 2014).44 If instead the Act discouraged
these teachers from entering, the true compositional change would be smaller. It is also possible
that, as of 2015, the supply of new teacher had still not reacted to the policy change. Becoming a
teacher requires an education investment of at least two years (the length of a master’s degree);
the supply of new teachers could therefore respond with a lag.
In an attempt to distinguish between these hypotheses, Appendix Figure A16 (bottom panel)
shows trends in the average selectivity of the institution where new teachers obtained their most
44

Hoxby and Leigh (2004) show that the decline in the entry rates of high-quality teachers in US public schools since
1960 can be attributed to increased compression in wages caused by the rise in unionization. Similarly, Rothstein
(2014) demonstrates that higher salaries and lower tenure rates can improve the supply of new teachers.

Clotfelter et al., 2010; Hoxby and Leigh, 2004). These trends do not show any change after 2011.
This suggests that the characteristics of new teachers did not vary much between 2012 and 2015.
This, however, does not eliminate the possibility that composition of the pool of entrants could
change over a longer time span. One should interpret and generalize the above findings with
this caveat in mind.

Effects on Teachers’ Effort
The pay scheme adopted by FP districts after Act 10 attracted higher VA teachers from other

districts and led lower VA teachers to leave. As movers and leavers represent only a small share
of the teachers’ population in each year, the resulting compositional change five years after the
policy change was rather modest in size. A pay scheme that rewards quality, however, could
affect all teachers (not only those who move or exit) through changes in the incentives to exert
more effort, with potentially larger effects on students.
To test this hypothesis I allow the VA of each teacher to vary between the pre- and postreform periods. I then estimate the following model:

V Ait =

0 F Pj

+ F Pj ⇤ postt +

1 Xit

+

2 Zjt

+ ⌧t + "ijt

(14)

where V Ait is the time-varying VA of teacher i, working in district j in year t. In this equation,
the coefficient

captures the overall change in teacher quality after Act 10 in FP districts relative

to SP, driven by both changes in composition and changes in effort.
OLS estimates of

indicate that the VA of teachers in FP districts increased by 0.11 standard

deviations after Act 10 compared with the VA of teachers in SP districts (Table 7, column 1, significant at 10 percent). Assuming that this overall change is simply the sum of a compositional
change (estimated in column 3 of Table 6) and a change in effort, approximately 35 percent of the
overall increase in VA is due to changes in effort (0.107 - 0.069 divided by 0.107), whereas 65 percent is driven by changes in composition. Time-varying estimates of

in Equation (14), shown

in Figure 10 (solid thick line), show no evidence of pre-trends and indicate that this increase
happened in 2012 and persisted through 2015.
To isolate changes in effort from changes in composition more directly, I re-estimate Equation
(14) using the subsample of incumbent teachers, i.e. those who did not move or exit between

Notes: The dependent variable is the VA of all teachers (columns 1, 3, 4, and 6) and incumbent teachers (columns 2 and 5). Incumbent teachers are defined as those who do not change district nor exit
Wisconsin public schools after Act 10. The variable FP equals one for FP districts. In columns 3 and
6, the variable FP is instrumented with an indicator for whether a teacher has taught at least once in
a FP district between 2007 and 2011. The variable post equals one for years following 2011. All the regressions include year fixed effects. District controls include interactions between 2009–2011 averages
of district characteristics and year dummies. CB controls include an indicator for whether the district
had a union recertification election in year t and whether the election was successful. Teacher controls
include indicators for each number of years of experience and for the highest education title (bachelor’s degree, master’s degree, Ph.D.). VA is calculated as the average of a time-varying measure over
the years 2007–2011 and 2012–2015. The sample is restricted to tenured teachers (with more than three
years of experience) working in FP, SP, and matched SP districts, and it covers years 2008 to 2015. The

the VA of incumbent teachers increased by approximately 0.1 standard deviations in FP districts
compared with SP districts after Act 10 (Table 7, column 2, p-value equal to 0.13). The sample of
incumbent teachers, however, could be endogenous: The decision not to move nor exit from a
given type of district could be correlated with unobservable teacher characteristics also related
to VA. To address this issue I re-estimate equation (14) with teacher fixed effects in order to capture the change in VA within each teacher. This estimate is estimated imprecisely; its magnitude,

however, is consistent with the above decomposition (point estimate equal to 0.052 standard deviations, Table 7, column 3). Estimates on the matched sample of FP and SP districts are larger
and more precise (Table 7, columns 4-6).
The above estimates are all based on a measure of VA that is allowed to change after Act 10.
The endogenous sorting of teachers after the reform could generate non-classical measurement
error in VA, for example if teachers who move to FP districts are assigned to systematically
different students (within schools) than movers to SP districts. Non-classical measurement error
in the dependent variable would lead to biased estimates of ; the direction and extent of the
bias depend on the sign and magnitude of the correlation between the error and F Pj . Appendix
Table A15 tests for changes in the characteristics of the students of the teachers who move to
FP and SP districts, in the year in which they move, before/after Act 10 and controlling for
school fixed effects.45 Movers to FP districts serve more low-SES students than movers to SP
districts; no differences can be registered in other student characteristics. A possible explanation
for this is that movers to SP districts after Act 10 are assigned slightly better students within each

school for a compensating differentials motive (since SP districts do not use their flexibility to
compensate teachers). This pattern of sorting could lead to overestimating the VA of movers to
SP districts relative to movers to FP districts, which would bias the estimate of

towards zero.

Lastly, no evidence exists of sorting of students across districts: the share of students who change
district remains constant around 2011 (Appendix Figure A12).
Taken together, these results indicate that a change in teacher pay from one based on seniority to one that rewards quality affects both the composition of the teaching workforce and
teachers’ effort. Since a one standard deviation increase in VA leads to a 0.2 standard deviations increase in student test scores (Chetty et al., 2014a), my estimates imply a 0.02 standard
deviations improvement in test scores in FP districts relative to SP districts after Act 10.46
The estimated increase in effort is in partial contrast to some existing works that show no
effects of financial incentives on teachers’ effort and productivity (Goodman and Turner, 2013;
Fryer, 2013; de Ree et al., 2018) and that conclude that alternative hiring and firing practices
are the only effective policies to improve teachers’ quality (Staiger and Rockoff, 2010; Rothstein,
2014). My findings are, however, based on a substantially different policy change, which does
not simply involve bonuses (such as Goodman and Turner, 2013; Fryer, 2013) or across-theboard salary increases (de Ree et al., 2018), but instead dramatically and permanently changes
the entire structure of teacher pay.

A Model of the Teachers’ Labor Market
The evidence presented so far shows that the introduction of flexible pay in a subset of Wis-

consin districts led to an improvement in the composition of the teaching workforce in these districts compared with the rest of the state. Albeit small in the short run, this effect could become
larger over time as more low-quality teachers leave FP districts and more high-quality teachers
move from SP to FP districts. This, however, assumes that SP districts maintain a senioritybased pay scheme in the medium and long-run. What would happen if, instead, flexible pay
were introduced in all districts?
The answer to this question is key to assessing the general-equilibrium effects of policies designed to attract and retain high-quality teachers. The selection patterns outlined above, however, are the combination of both demand and supply forces; it is therefore difficult to provide
46
As a benchmark, a reduction in class size from 22–25 to 13–17 students (35-40 percent) leads to a 0.2 standard
deviations increase in test scores (Krueger, 1999).

40

an answer extrapolating from these partial-equilibrium results.
To address the limitations of the reduced-form approach, I build and estimate a model of
the teachers’ labor market and I use it to simulate the effects of alternative salary schemes on
the composition of the teaching workforce.47 The model is an extended version of a simple Roy
model with endogenous labor demand. Utility-maximizing teachers supply labor to districts;
districts hire teachers to maximize a payoff function that depends on teachers’ characteristics,
subject to budget and capacity constraints. Salaries are exogenously determined and districtspecific. In equilibrium, each side of the market maximizes its payoffs taking the choices of all
other agents as given. Matches are formed as a result.48
For the sake of tractability, the model does not fully capture all the features of teachers’
labor markets. First, teachers cannot choose effort (or decide where to teach based on how
hard they want to work), and they cannot have a comparative advantage in teaching certain
districts or students. The outside option is fixed across teachers, and the model does not allow
for endogenous entry.49 Lastly, I assume that salaries are exogenously determined, ruling out
the possibility that districts set them strategically. Despite these limitations, the model is able
to capture and replicate the sorting patterns observed in the data and can be used to study the
effects of counterfactual pay schemes on the composition of the teaching workforce.

7.1

Model Setup
The framework is a two-sided static choice model in which job vacancies and salaries are

exogenously determined. Matching between teachers and districts happens in two steps. First,
each district decides whether to make an offer to each teacher. Each teacher then reviews her
offers and either chooses the one that maximizes her utility or leaves the market. Job matches
are realized as a result.
47

Older studies of teachers’ labor markets, such as Antos and Rosen (1975), estimate teacher labor supply using a
hedonic-salaries approach based on the consideration that, if salaries are set to clear the market, then the salaries and
the teacher-district matches observed in equilibrium are implied by (and can be used to derive) the preferences of
teachers and districts. Teacher salaries, however, are typically rigid and unable to fully adjust for differences in either
workers’ characteristics or the non-pecuniary attributes of their jobs. Hedonic models are hence not appropriate for
this setting.
48
This model is similar to that of Boyd et al. (2013), who use many-to-one matching to estimate teachers’ and
schools’ preferences. My paper builds on this approach in two ways. First, I model districts’ choices as the outcome of
a constrained maximization problem, explicitly incorporating a budget constraint and a capacity constraint. Second,
I exploit the unique variation in salaries introduced by Act 10 (documented above) to estimate the parameters.
49
Previous studies on this topic include, among others: Dolton and Van der Klaauw (1999), who affirm the importance of salaries and opportunity wages in teachers’ turnover decisions and illustrate the insight gained from
differentiating between multiple destinations or exit types; Boyd et al. (2005); and Goldhaber et al. (2011), who find
heterogeneity in mobility behavior across the performance distribution and evidence that teacher mobility is affected
by student demographics and achievement.

41

Districts’ Problem. District j’s payoff from hiring teacher i, uij , is a function of teacher i’s
characteristics such as experience, education, and VA.50 The total district payoff is the sum of
teacher-specific payoffs across all hired teachers. Each district decides which teachers are to be
extended job offers. This choice is summarized by the vector oj = [o1j , o2j , ..., oNj ], where oij = 1
if district j extends a job offer to teacher i, and N is the number of teachers. Lastly, district j can
spend up to Bj in salaries and can hire up to Hj teachers. District j’s problem is as follows (I
omit the subscript j for ease of notation):

(16)

where wi is the salary paid to teacher i, and hi is the probability that teacher i accepts the district’s offer, if one is made. In other words, each district maximizes the expected payoff from
making a set o of offers, with respect to the probability of acceptance. Constraints in (16) are
“soft,” i.e. they must only hold in expectation. Intuitively, districts incorporate the fact that an
offer made to a teacher i is only accepted with probability hi . Since offers are made simultaneously, districts choose the offer set that maximizes their expected payoff and, in expectation,
allows them to spend at most B and hire at most H teachers.
Salaries. In keeping with the reduced-form analysis I assume that salaries are not competitive,
i.e. they do not adjust to equate demand and supply in equilibrium; they are instead exogenously determined and district-specific. The advantage of this assumption is that it makes the
model more tractable and realistic. If salaries were competitive, in practice all districts should
have switched to flexible pay after Act 10; yet this did not happen.51 The drawback of this assumption is that it rules out the possibility that each district’s salary structure is dependent on
other endogenous variables of the model, for example the pre-Act 10 composition of the teaching workforce.
Teacher’s Problem. Teachers have preferences over job characteristics. In each period they receive a set of offers Oi from school districts and choose the one that maximizes their utility. I
define the utility of teacher i from working in district j as vij . Each teacher faces an outside
50

This framework can be reconciled with one in which districts maximize a function of student achievement, which
is in turn an additive function of teacher characteristics.

If salaries were competitive, one could simply use the hedonic approach of Antos and Rosen (1975) to estimate
teachers’ preferences.

Estimation
To estimate the parameters of teachers’ utility and districts’ payoffs I make the following

assumptions.
Districts. They have identical and linear payoffs from hiring teacher i: uij = xi + "ij , where
is a vector of parameters, and the vector xi includes teacher VA, years of experience, and an
indicator for having a master’s degree. The variable "ij is an idiosyncratic component, independent across teachers and districts and identically and normally distributed with mean 0 and
variance

2.

This formulation implicitly assumes that each district is able to perfectly observe

all teachers’ attributes, including VA.
Each district’s problem can be solved using linear programming techniques. The problem
is analogous to a two-constraint version of the 0-1 knapsack problem (Dantzig, 1957). I solve it
using the algorithm of Martello and Toth (2003), based on the “continuization” of the discrete
problem. The algorithm is detailed in Appendix D.
Teachers. They have identical and linear preferences from a job in j: vij = ↵zij + ⇠ij , where ↵ is a
vector of utility parameters. The vector zij includes salary (in $1,000), distance from the district
where teacher i is an incumbent (in miles), an indicator for teacher i being an incumbent in
district j (which captures the cost of moving across districts, assumed constant across teachers
43

and districts), the share of disadvantaged students, and an indicator for urban districts. The
variable ⇠ij is an idiosyncratic utility component, independent across districts and identically
distributed with an Extreme Value Type 1 distribution. Teacher i’s utility from the outside option
is constant in expectation and equal to vi0 = ↵0 + ⇠i0 , where ⇠i0 is independent across teachers,
orthogonal to ⇠ij , and identically distributed with an Extreme Value Type 1 distribution.
Salaries. Estimating teachers’ preferences requires observing the characteristics of all the job alternatives available to a teacher, including salaries. In the data, however, I only observe salaries
when a match is realized. To construct salary offers for unrealized matches, I back out each
district’s post-Act 10 salary structure by estimating a wage function separately for each district:

wijt =

0j

+

j f (Xit )

+

jV

(18)

Ait + !ijt

where Xit is a full set of interactions between indicators for two-year seniority classes and highest education degree, and V Ait is time-varying VA of teacher i.
Budget and Capacity Constraints. I construct each district’s budget limit by multiplying the previous year’s total salary bill by the pre-Act 10 growth rate of total salaries. Similarly, I construct
the capacity limit by multiplying the district’s enrollment in the previous year by the average,
district-specific number of teachers per student in the years until 2011.
7.2.1 Estimation Procedure
I first estimate the salary parameters

0j ,

j,

and

j

in Equation (18) outside of the model

and separately for each district, using OLS and data on post-reform teacher-district matches.
I use these estimates to back out salaries for each teacher in each district. I then estimate the
parameter vectors ↵ (teachers’ utility), ↵0 (teachers’ outside option),

(districts’ payoff), and

2

(variance of the district’s shock) using maximum likelihood. I divide Wisconsin into 12 separate
geographic labor markets, corresponding to the 12 Cooperative Educational Service Agencies
(CESAs), and I exclude the CESAs of Milwaukee and Madison. I assume that teachers can
only move within CESAs and that districts can only make offers to teachers already working
in their CESA.52 I estimate the parameters using data from 2014. The final sample contains
12,573 tenured teachers working in 410 districts.53 Table A16 shows summary statistics of the
estimation sample. The estimation procedure is outlined in more detail in Appendix D.
52
53

In 2014, about 60 percent of teacher movements happened within a CESA.
In order to fully capture movements, I exclude teachers whose previous district is missing in 2014.

7.3

Identification
The model allows for a transparent identification of the parameters of teachers’ utility. Iden-

tification relies on cross-district heterogeneity in district characteristics (such as location and student composition) and on the variation in salaries introduced by Act 10. Movements of teachers
across districts and exits help identify the utility parameters ↵ and ↵0 .54
Identification of the parameters of districts’ payoff function is more subtle. The parameters
and

are identified out of cross-district variation in optimal offer strategies. While I assume

that districts have identical preferences, their optimal strategies might differ due to differences
in their budget and capacity constraints. These differences, in turn, arise from the attrition of
different types of teachers over time. To see this, consider the following example. Suppose that
districts A and B are identical in terms of student and teacher composition, size, salary structure,
and ex ante budget. At a certain point in time they both lose one teacher and thus have one
vacancy to fill. If district A’s exiting teacher has 30 years of experience (and was therefore being
paid a high salary) but district B’s teacher only has one (and was being paid a lower salary),
then district A has more money “freed up” (and therefore a larger budget) than district B. To
the extent that the characteristics of leavers are random (which the reduced-form results show
to be true before Act 10), the hiring choices of district A, compared with B, reveal how teacher
attributes are valued, and they identify

7.4

and .55

Parameter Estimates and Elasticities
Table 8 shows estimates and standard errors of the model’s parameters. Teachers receive

positive utility from salary and negative utility from distance. A positive and significant estimate for the incumbent dummy indicates that fixed moving costs are important. Lastly, teachers
prefer suburban and rural districts to urban ones (Table 8, column 1).
To interpret the magnitudes of these coefficients, I compare the elasticities between the prob54

For example, suppose teacher x is an incumbent in district A where she earns a wage wA . She receives an offer
from district B, located five miles from A and offering a wage wB , with wB > wA , and an offer from district C, located
seven miles from A and offering a wage wC , with wC > wB . The choice of teacher x identifies the parameters her
utility. For example, if she chooses C, this implies that the desire for higher salaries offsets the drawback of a longer
commute and translates into a higher utility parameter on salaries and a lower parameter on distance. Similarly,
teachers’ exit will identify the value of the outside option.
55
Another useful example is the following. Suppose that, given teachers’ preferences and districts’ budgets, for
given values of and districts’ optimal strategies are such that one district ends up hiring too many teachers and
the other ends up hiring too few with respect to their capacity. To bring the market into equilibrium, and need to
adjust in order for each district to maximize its payoff and satisfy both constraints. Similarly, if the optimal strategies
given teachers’ preferences, districts’ capacities, and given parameter values are such that one or both districts violate
the budget constraint, and need to adjust to bring the market back into equilibrium.

Notes: Estimates of the parameters of the structural model. Parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood. Defining pij as the probability that teacher i moves to district j, the elasticity of pij to a continuous job characteristic zij (implied by the logit assumption on the error term of teachers’ utility) is
↵z (1 pij )zij , where ↵z is the parameter estimate on zij . The elasticity of urban and incumbent is defined as
(1 pij )(1 exp( ↵z )). Elasticities are evaluated at the median of each variable, equal to $59,000 for salary,
0.19 miles for distance, and 38 percent for the share of disadvantaged students. Standard errors in parentheses are calculated as the square root of the inverse of the information matrix using numerical derivatives.

ability of matching with a district and various district characteristics, shown in column 2 of
Table 8.56 A 1 percent higher salary (equivalent to $590 at the mean) is associated with a 0.21
percent increase in the match probability (Table 8, columns 1-2). A 10 percent increase in distance is associated with a 1.2 percent lower probability.57 Moving costs (which correspond to
the opposite of the estimate of the incumbent dummy) are equal to approximately 4.56 percent
of salary (0.9660/0.2117), or $2,690.
These elasticities allow me to assess the importance of job characteristics for teachers’ labor
supply and to calculate compensating differentials, i.e. the required salary increases to attract
and retain teachers to districts with certain characteristics. For example, consider two identical
districts that want to hire a teacher employed in another district, one of which is 10 miles farther
from where the teacher is currently working. The estimated elasticities imply that the fartheraway district must offer a large 28 percent larger salary to attract the teacher (since a two mile
longer distance requires a 5.68 percent higher salary, or 10*0.1202/0.2117).
Estimates of the parameters of districts’ payoffs imply that districts prefer higher VA teach56
Defining pij as the probability that teacher i matches with district j, the elasticity of pij to a job characteristic zij
implied by the logit assumption on the error term of teachers’ utility is z (1 pij )zij . The elasticities shown in the

ers, as well as those with more experience. Districts are indifferent between a teacher who has
one extra year of seniority or 0.13 standard deviations higher VA (0.1099/0.8291, Table 8, column
3).

Alternative Pay Schemes and Workforce Composition
The structure of the model and the parameter estimates can be used to simulate the effects of

alternative salary schemes on the composition of the teaching workforce. I focus on two types of
counterfactuals. The first is a change in the salary component associated with VA (captured by
the coefficient in Equation (18) only in one district, with salaries unchanged in all other districts.
The second is a change in

in all districts at the same time. In both cases I model the change as

budget neutral by letting base salaries adjust to the change in .58

8.1

Increase in Quality Pay in One District
I start by simulating the effect of a change in

only in one district. This change affects

both teachers’ labor supply and demand. First, it affects the budget and the salaries paid by
the district. Second, it affects the preference ordering of all teachers, including those employed
in other districts. This will, in turn, influence the probability that a teacher matches with any
district, not only with the one affected by the policy.
I first solve the model for values of

ranging from zero to 1.5 standard deviations of . I

then plot the change in the probability that teachers in different quartiles of the distribution of
VA move to, move out of, or exit from the district, as well as the change in the composition of
the district’s teaching workforce. For exposition, I perform the analysis on the school district of
Ashland, an urban SP district.59
Figure 11 illustrates the changes in the simulated probability of moving to, moving out of,
or exiting the district as

increases from zero to 1.5 standard deviations, by quartile of VA.

Teachers in the bottom quartile are 2 percent less likely to move to Ashland when

increases

by one standard deviation (compared to when it is equal to zero); teachers in the top quartile
are instead 25 percent more likely to move there (Figure 11, panel A). In addition, teachers with
VA in the bottom quartile are 6 percent more likely to move out, whereas those with VA in the
58

To keep the budget neutral, I assume that base salaries, captured by 0j in Equation (18), adjust immediately
depending on the new value of and the current composition of the district’s teaching workforce.
59
The school district of Ashland is located in the north-west part of the state. This urban district runs five schools,
including four elementary and middle schools; it enrolled 2,101 students in 2014 year, 61 percent of whom are economically disadvantaged, and employs 35 teachers in my sample in 2014.

47

top quartile are 6 percent less likely (Figure 11, panel B). Lastly, teachers with VA in the bottom
quartile are 6 percent more likely to exit and teachers in the top quartile are 6 percent less likely
(Figure 11, panel C).
Figure 12 shows the change in the average VA of teachers moving in, moving out, and exiting
the school district for different values of (panel A) and the change in the overall composition of
the district’s teaching workforce (panel B). The figure shows that the average VA of movers in the
district increases slightly, the average VA of movers out of the district decreases slightly, and the
average VA of exiters from the district declines more sharply. As a result, the overall composition
of the district’s workforce improves by 0.2 percent when

increases by one standard deviation

(Figure 12).
The results from this simulation exercise are in line with the reduced-form results: An increase in the share of salaries related to teacher quality is associated with an improvement in the
composition of the district’s teaching workforce, which in the case of the Ashland district is very
small. This improvement is driven by higher VA teachers moving to the district from neighboring districts, attracted by higher salaries, and by lower VA teachers moving out to other districts
or leaving teaching altogether.

8.2

Introduction of Quality Pay in All Districts
I now simulate the compositional effect of a change in

in all districts. The results from

this second counterfactual exercise do not trivially follow from the first. To see this, consider

Notes: Percentage change in the probability that a teacher moves to the Ashland school district (panel A),

the decision of a teacher working in Ashland. She must decide whether to stay where she is,
move to another district, or exit teaching. The first counterfactual directly affects the first option
(staying). The second counterfactual directly affects two out of three options (because it affects
salaries in all districts); it therefore also changes the value of leaving relative to remaining in
public schools. As a result, the effect of a change in salaries in all districts on the exit behavior of
teachers could in principle be very different from the one outlined in the previous subsection.
Results from this simulation indicate that teachers with VA in the three bottom quartiles are

less likely to move to Ashland when

increases by one standard deviation in all districts (for

example, teachers in the second quartile are 4 percent less likely), whereas teachers with VA in
the top quartile are 14 percent more likely to move there (Figure 13, Panel A). Teachers with VA
in the top and bottom quartile, however, are also equally less likely to move out of Ashland,
whereas teachers in the third quartile are 2 percent more likely. Lastly, teachers with VA in the
bottom quartile are 7 percent more likely to exit, and teachers with VA in the top quartile are 6
percent less likely (Figure 13, panel C).
Figure 14 shows the average VA of teachers moving in, out, and exiting the school district
for different values of

and the overall composition of the district’s teaching workforce. The

figure shows that the composition of the teaching workforce in Ashland worsens by 7 percent
of a standard deviation of VA when increases by one standard deviation (Figure 14, panel B).
The results from these simulations show that an increase in the quality component of salaries
in all districts could lead to a much different change in the composition of a district’s workforce
compared with the case in which

only increases only in one district. The reason is that, when

quality pay increases only in one district, part of the resulting compositional improvement is
driven by better teachers moving in and worse teachers moving out. When

increases in all

districts, this net inflow of high-quality teachers might be absent because quality is rewarded at
the same rate everywhere.

counterfactual.

The results from the two counterfactuals suggest that the observed improvement in the composition of the teaching workforce in FP districts might be limited to the short run. If all districts
eventually introduce merit pay in order to compete for the best teachers, the longer-term effects
of Act 10 in each district, and in the whole state, might be more limited in size.
When interpreting the results of these simulations, a few important caveats apply. First, due
to the impossibility of accurately measuring the quality of new teachers, the model does not
incorporate entry and implicitly assumes that the quality of entrants is constant and equal to
the quality of incumbents. The new pay scheme, however, could change workers’ incentives
to enter public school teaching, either by attracting more talented workers or by discouraging
risk-averse workers. Second, the model does not capture the effects of a flexible pay scheme on
teachers’ effort. Even if the compositional changes become smaller as more districts switch to
FP, overall teacher productivity could rise in response to this change in pay.

Discussion and Conclusion
The role of teachers’ unions and the powers enjoyed by these associations have come under

scrutiny in recent times, culminating with the Supreme Court decision in Janus v. AFSCME.
Given the importance of individual teachers in shaping children’s educational opportunities
(Rockoff, 2004), policies affecting teachers’ labor markets can have very large effects on students.
This paper provides an initial assessment of these effects by exploiting a recent change in the
scope of CB for teachers’ unions that has only affected one US state so far, but that could be
replicated in other states in the near future.
I exploit this policy change to assess its effects on the composition of the teaching workforce
and to study teachers’ labor supply and demand. A switch away from seniority pay toward
flexible pay in a subset of Wisconsin districts, following the interruption of CB on teachers’
salary schedules mandated by Act 10 of 2011, resulted in high-quality teachers moving to FP
districts and low-quality teachers either moving to SP districts or leaving the public school system altogether. As a result, the composition of the teaching workforce improved in FP districts
compared with SP districts. Effort exerted by all teachers also increased.
As cross-district movements and exits are rare events, the magnitudes of these compositional changes (and the associated increase in student test scores) are limited in size in the short
run, but they could become larger over time as more teachers move and exit each year and as
salaries become more strongly related to teachers’ quality and effort. If, however, SP districts
51

also switch to a FP scheme over time, the long-run effects of a policy change such as Act 10 could
be very different. To understand what would happen under this scenario, I estimate teachers’
labor demand and supply using a structural model of this labor market and I use the variation
in post-Act 10 salary schemes across districts, as well as teachers’ movements and exits, to identify the model’s parameters. Simulations of this model on alternative pay schemes show that
the introduction of flexible pay in all districts would lead to a much smaller (and possibly negative) compositional improvement than the one experienced by FP districts so far. This suggests
that the observed gains in teacher composition and achievement in FP districts might be short
lived and that the longer-term effects on each district (and on the whole state) might be more
contained.
While this paper has focused on movements of teachers across districts and on exits from
the profession, the effects of a policy such as Act 10 on the supply of new teachers could also be
important and represent an interesting and important avenue for future research.
