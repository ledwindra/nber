The Roles of Monetary, Financial and
Fiscal Policy under Rational Expectations
Willem H. Buiter*

Summary
The paper evaluates the implications for the conduct of monetary, fiscal
and financial policy of the "rational expectations revolution" in macroeconomics.
The general conclusion is that most of the policy conclusions derived from
conventional eclectic Neo-Keynesian models remain valid when rational expectations
are introduced: to anticipate policy is not to neutralize it. Both structural
policies aimed at altering the level and composition of full employment output
in the short run and in the long run and stabilization policies aimed at
influencing the cyclical departures of output and employment from their full
employment levels are considered.
The consequences of structural fiscal policy--changes in non-lump-sum tax
rates and in public spending--for full employment output and

e~ployment

are

non-controversial. The confirmation of familiar Neo-Keynesian results about
financial and monetary policy may be more surprising. Here the I'lajor policy
conclusions are the following:
1) ~~_!!~~~~!~~_~!_~~~~~~~~!_~E~~~!~~.For a given level and composition
of real government spending on goods and services, the substitution of bond
financing for current (lump-sum) taxes reduces saving in the short run and
lowers the capital-labor ratio in the long run. This crowding out result
persists even if each economic agent allows fully for the future taxes
"required" to service the stocy: of privately held interest-bearing public
debt. It even holds when allowance is made for the possibility of

bequ~sts

and other private intergenerational gifts. In a situation of Keynesian
unemployment the crowding out of saving in the short run may be an appropriate
policy to achieve a higher degree of resource utilization. The substitution
of money financing for tax financing is also not a matter of indifference.
The "inflation tax" is not equivalent to explicit current taxes. In the
simple models considered in the paper, the substitution of money financing
for tax financing "crowds in" saving and raises the capital-labor ratio in
the long run.

T.

Neo~eynesian

Irttroduc~ion

accounts of the roles of monetary, financia1,and fiscal

policy have recently been challenged by a revival of classical macroeconomic
thinking--an approach to theory and policy that many had considered forever
buried under the economic ruins of the Great Depression.

This New Classical

Macroeconomics is associated originally with Milton Friedman (1968) and more
recently with Phelps (1970), Lucas (1972a, b, 1975, 1976) Sargent and
Wallace (1975, 1976) Barro (1974, 1976,1979), and a host of others.

The

main implications of this approach for macroeconomic policy can be summarized in two"rieutra1ity or worselt propositions.
Deterministic (and known) monetary policy rules can have no effect
on the joint probability distribution functions of real economic variab1es-neutrality--but stochastic monetary policy behavior can increase the variability of real variables relative to their full information va1ues--or
worse.

This proposition has at times been extended to encompass not only

monetary policy but stabilization policy in general.
Debt neutrality:

(McCallum, 1977.)

the full real impact of the government sector is

measured by the magnitude and composition of its real

spend~~g_

program.

The financing mode chosen, current taxes, borrowing or currency creation,
is of no consequence.

This proposition, first analyzed by Ricardo, has

recently been restated by Barro (1974).
In a recent paper, "The Macroeconomics of Dr. Pang1oss" (Buiter, 1980
forthcoming), I have presented a nontechnical survey of the two theoretical

- 2 -

cornerstones of the New Classical Macroeconomics.

These are rational

expectations in the sense of Muth and what I have called the "surprise"
supply function--the proposition that only unanticipated policy changes
(or other unanticipated, exogenous disturbances) can cause the real
economic system to depart from an otherwise policy-invariant equilibrium
trajectory.

In this paper I shall say nothing further about the rational

expectations assumption.

It, or its deterministic counterpart, perfect

foresight, will be incorporated in every model considered below.

My

purpose is to provide a more formal statement of the propositions
advanced in my "Pangloss" paper concerning the scope for monetary policy,
debt management policy, and fiscal policy under rational expectations.
The setup is as follows.

Section II presents a fairly standard, small

deterministic macromodel with a number of classical features.

All markets

clear instantaneously, there is no money illusion and perfect foresight
rules.

The effects of monetary, financial, and fiscal policy in this

model are analyzed.

A number of non-neutrality propositions are stated.

The drawback of this model is that it is ad hoc in the sense that private
behavioral relationships have not been derived from explicit optimizing
behavior.

Section III therefore studies debt neutrality and monetary super-

neutrality in a "fully rational" overlapping generations

model.

This leads

to the conclusion that the ad hoc model of Section II is not a bad parable
for such fully rational models.

Section IV abandons the assumption of

universal instantaneous Walrasian equilibrium and considers the consequences
of price arid wage stickiness. for the scope for ·stabilization policy; stochastic models are analyzed here, which also permits the consideration
of some of the interesting issues associated with incomplete information.

Effects of 'structural' fiscal artdtilortetary policy
Fiscal and monetary policy will have important effects in this equilibrium
model.

The level and composition of real full employment output can be influenced

in the short run (identified with the unit period of analysis), in the long
run (the steady-state equilibrium) and in the real-time intermediate run in
which policy decisions are actually made.

These real output effects are not

due to the elimination of involuntary Keynesian excess supply but to policyinduced changes in important relative prices.

This alters the labor-leisure

trade-off, the intertemporal consumption trade-off, the marginal cost of
labor, etc.

Standard comparative statics yield the following policy

conclusions:

Taxation.

The non lump-sum tax changes are constant revenue changes with

adjusting endogenously.

Consider the special case of the labor supply function

where it is independent of the real interest rate and of net worth.

If the

labor supply schedule is upward-sloping, an increase in the tax rate on
labor income, t , will shift it to the left, reducing full employment output

and employment for a given stock of capital.

ment and output by shifting the labor demand schedule to the left, for a
given stock of capital.

An increase in t 1T , the profit tax, will affect--

presumably lower--the rate of private capital formation in the short run
and the steady-state capital-labor ratio in the long run.

An increase in

capital gains taxation, t , will have similar effects in the short run. In
c
steady-state equilibrium there are no real capital gains so changes in
capital gains taxation will not affect the long-run real equilibrium.

An

increase in the tax rate on interest income, t , will lower the required
R
rate of return on capital.

This will tend to stimulate capital formation

in the short run and raise the capital-labor ratio in the long run.

Debt Neutrality and Monetary Superneutra1ity in
FullyOptimiiing Models

a.Debt neutrality in anoptimizingmacromode1
In two recent studies· (Buiter and Tobin,:'l980,

Tobin and Buiter, 1980) ~

James Tobin and I concluded that debt neutra1ity--the property
trajectory of the economic system is invariant under changes in

the real

mix, for a given level and composition of real government spending--is a
theoretical curiosum.

The assumptions required for it to be valid can easily

be shown to be contradicted by practical experience.

In this section of the

paper, I shall restate the case against debt neutrality in the context of a
model constructed expressly to be as favorable as possible to classical

- 12 -

invariance theorems.

The model is a generalization of Diamond's over-

lapping generations model (Diamond, 1965), and allows for voluntary intergenerational gifts and bequests.

(See Barro, 1974, and Buiter; 1980a).

A comprehensive treatment of the subject can be found in Carmichael (1979).
Except for some minor changes, the treatment of the case of agents with
"two-sided intergenerational caring"

replicates the original work of

Carmichael.
The overlapping generations model used to develop the non-neutrality
theories is "classical" in the sense that private actions are derived

I shall study the behavior of this decentralized, com-

petitive economy when a given government opending program is

financ~d

by different combinations of lump-sum taxation or current borrowing.

With-

out loss of generality the level of government spending is assumed to equal
zero, which allows us to rephrase the argument in terms of the real effects
of alternative debt issue-taxation programs.

The restriction to lump-sum

taxes is necessary to give the neutrality proposition a chance.

Non-lump-

sum taxes on labor income, profits, wealth or any other base, will introduce
·stortions, impose excess burdens and, except in uninteresting special

for the debt neutrality property to prevail.
neutrality goes as follows.

Briefly, the argument for

debt has no effect on private behavior because

to finance the bond income.

The value of the government bonds on the

asset side of private portfolios is the present discounted value of these
future income payments.

The value of these bonds is therefore exactly

matched by the present discounted value of the future tax payments
required to service them.

Even if we grant that the future payments stream

and the future tax payments stream are identical and that both are discounted in the same manner? a shift from tax financing to borrowing could
cause non-neutrality because of an intergenerational redistribution of
resources.

The government's attempt to redistribute "gross resources"

from the young to the old will in that case by met by increased bequests
from the old to the young, leaving the "net resources" available to each
generation unchanged.

If, on the other hand, the older generations were

initially at a "zero bequest corner," -i. e., if in order to increase their
own life-time resources they would gladly have left their children a
negative legacy, had this not been ruled out by law, the involuntary
intergenerational redistribution would not have been neutralized by an
exactly matching voluntary transfer in the opposite direction.
Within the bounds set by the non-negativity constraints on gifts and
bequests, lump-sum redistribution through borrowing or unfunded social
security schemes will be neutralized by voluntary intergenerational
transfers, if bequest or gift motives are present.

In order to maximize the stationary per capita amount of resources available
for consumption, the social planner selects the golden rule capital-labor
ratio k*.

The stationary social consumption possibility locus is the

straight line yy with slope -(1 + n).

By distribution through administrative

fiat, any point on this yy locus is available to the social planner.

A

decentralized competitive equilibrium with a capital-labor ratio below k*,
as at E ,is not inefficient.
3

During any transition from E to E , say,
1
3

capital deepening has to occur, requiring the sacrifice of consumption during
the transition in exchange for a permanently higher consumption path after
E has been achieved.
1

A capital-labor ratio in excess of the golden rule is

inefficient because it is possible to reduce the capital-labor ratio and
thus to have a temporary consumption binge while enjoying a permanently
higher path of consumption after k* has been achieved.

This inefficiency is

due to capital's dual role as a store of value and a factor of production.
In an attempt to shift consumption towards retirement, private agents save
by accumulating capital.

This depresses the rate of interest.

By making

available a store of value that has no additional intrinsic use, either as
a consumption good or a capital good, government borrowing can alleviate
and even eliminate any such inefficiency due to overaccumulation.

Bequests
With bequests, the utility function, the budget constraint and the
capital market equilibrium condition are altered.

Bt is the bequest

left in the second period of his life by a member of generation t to
the members of generation t+l.

The bequests are received by members of

generation t+l at the end of the first period of their lives.

The value

of the bequest to members of generation t+l at the beginning of their
second period is Bt (l+r t +2)'

The first order conditions for an optimum are:
III. 3la

III. 3lb
If Bt > 0, i.e., if there is an interior solution for bequests, III.3Ib
holds with equality.

If there is a corner solution for bequests, i.e.,

if B = 0 is a binding constraint, III.3lb holds with strict inequality.
The interpretation of these first order conditions is straightforward.
III.3Ia says that the discounted marginal utility of consumption in the
second period of one's life should equal the marginal utility of consumption
in t!1e first period of one's life.

III.3Ib states that if bequests are

positive, the marginal utility of own consumption should equal the marginal
utility of leaving a bequest.

A marginal unit of income saved by an old

member of generation t yields resources (l+r t +2) times larger to generation
t+l.

The marginal utility to a member of generation t of bequests can

be expressed as the discounted value of the marginal utility of consumption

- 27 -

,

.

of a member of generation t+1.

The appropriate discount rate is the

generational discount rate o.

Finally, since it is the utility of a

representative member of generation t+1 that was assumed to enter into
the utility function of generation t, rather than the utility of all l+n
descendants, the population growth factor l+n also discounts the marginal
utility of consumption of generation t+1.

If the marginal utility of own

consumption exceeds the marginal utility of bequests, there will be a
corner solution with B=O.
The steady state equilibrium of the model with bequests is given
in equations 111.32.

Considering

A higher value of B shifts the locus down

One such interior solution for bequests is drawn at A3 , where an

indifference curve is tangent to a budget constraint with slope -(l+f'(k»

The stationary consumption possibility locus

for the appropriate positive value of B is represented by the dashed curve
through A3 •

The complete stationary locus with bequests is given by the

no-bequest locus above AZ and the line segment AZA3A4 •

If the stationary

competitive equilibrium is on AlA Z ' i.e., if there is a corner solution
for bequests, the effect of government lending and borrowing is as in the
no-bequest model.

If the model is stable, the introduction of government

borrowing (d > 0) will reduce the equilibrium capital labor-ratio, while
the introduction of government lending (d < 0) will increase it.

However,

government borrowing can never reduce the capital-labor ratio below k.
Once k falls to k, any further increase in government borrowing (which
represents an involuntary redistribution of income from the young to
the old) will be matched by exactly offsetting bequests, voluntary
transfers from the old to the young.

This is most easily appreciated

if we consider the effect of government lending.

Start from an initial

equilibrium, without government lending, with positive bequests as at
A3 •

With bequests, bonds and taxes the private budget constraint

111.Z9 and the capital market equilibrium condition 111.30 are replaced

Then the involuntary government redistribution from

the old to the young will be neutralized as regards its effect on the lifetime resources of the two generations alive at anyone moment, by the
reduction in voluntary private redistribution from the old to the young.
Given any initial value of bequests, however, there always exists a
volume of government lending large enough to put private agents in a
zero-bequest corner.

a member of generation t-l.

If Gt > 0, i.e., if there is an interi~r solution for gifts, III.37b
holds with equality.

If there is a corner solution for gifts, i.e., if

G=O is a binding constraint, III37b holds with strict inequality.
Equation III.37a is the condition for the optimal allocation of consumption for a member of generation t between the two periods of his life.
III.37b states that if gifts are given from generation t to generation t-l, the marginal utility of own consumption should equal the
marginal utility of gifts.

The marginal utility of gifts is then

expressed in terms of the marginal utility of own consumption of a
member of generation t-l.

This marginal utility of own consumption of

generation t-l is discounted at the generational discount factor (l+p).
Second-period consumption of members of generation t-l takes place one
period before second-period consumption of members of generation t,
so interest

is foregune and further discounting by (l+rt+l) is required.

Finally, there are more members of generation t than of generation t-I. . A
member of generation t-l therefore receives Gt(l+n) for Gt given up by a
member of generation t.

If the marginal utility of own consumption exceeds

the marginal utility of gifts, Gt=O.

Parental utility is discounted, even though it "accrues" earlier.

Thus

child-parent gifts do not make a private decentralized economy with

It also does not rule out the possibility of dynamic inefficiency through
overaccumulation.

Quite the contrary, if gifts are positive in the steady

state, the steady state is necessarily inefficient.

An operative gift

motive is indeed a reflection of a very strong desire to shift resources
away from early consumption towards later consumption.
The effect of gifts on the steady state consumption possibility locus
is indicated in Figure 5.

The effect of government borrowing and lending in the presence of
a gift motive is easily analyzed.

As long as the economy stays in the

range of capital-labor ratios below

i,

government lending and borrowing

will have the same effect as in the model without gifts and bequests.
If k=~ initially (with d=O), government lending (d < 0) will not have any
effect on the steady-state consumption path and capital-labor ratio.
Involuntary government redistribution from the old to the young will be
neutralized immediately by matching voluntary gifts from the young to the
old.

Government borrowing, d > 0, will also be neutralized by matching

reductions in gifts from the young to the old, up to the point that the
constraint G > 0 becomes binding.

For any initial G, however, there always exists a government borrow-

Gifts and bequests

about the welfare of its immediate ancestors and its immediate descendants.

It might be thought that the solution to the problem with both gifts

cases with just gifts and just bequests.

This is not so.

These issues were discussed
A particularly simple solution

emerges when the following assumptions are made about the "game" played
by a member of generation t with past and future generations:
1.

A member of generation t acts competitively in his

capital markets, i.e. he takes w and r + as parametric.
t
t l

labor and

He also assumes

that all past and future generations have acted or will act competitively
in their factor markets.
2.

A member of generation t, in formulating his consumption gift-

bequest plan, knows the utility levels and actions of all past generations and
correctly anticipates utility levels and actions of all future generations
(rational expectations or perfect foresight).
3.

A member of generation t plays a non-cooperative gift and bequest

game with past and future generations.

He rationally believes that all past

and future generations play the same game.

This strategy is closed-loop as

- 36a -

regards "the utility and actions of the two generations with which he overlaps
(generations t-1 and t+1).

This means that when evaluating the alternative

actions open to him at the beginning of period t, he believes that he can
affect the total utility and the actions of his immediate descendants and his
immediate forebears.
His stre.tegy is open-loop as regards the utility and actions of all other
generations (t-i,

i~2

and t+j,

j~2).

Thus, when evaluating the effects of

marginal changes in his actions, he ignores the impact on the actions and
utility of generations that are already dead when he is born or that are born
after his 1ifetime. 9 /
4.

When formulating his closed-loop strategy vis-a-vis generations t-1

and t+1, he believes that he can alter the behavior_of these generations (i.e.
their consumption, gift and bequest choices) only by altering the total resources
available to them, i.e., only through direct transfers.
5.

Each generations acts so as to maximize its utility.

6.

Each generation views the w"or1d and plays the game in the same way as

the member of generation t just described.
The resulting equilibrium in this differential game is a Nash equilibrium.

Conclusions
The policy conclusions of this theoretical investigation of debt neutrality are straightforward.

While operative intergenerational gift and

bequest motives turn finite-lived households into infinite-lived households
in a certain sense, there remain essential differences.

In particular,

if the child-parent gift motive is operative, the decentralized, competitive equilibrium is socially inefficient because it is characterized by
a capital-Iab?r ratio above the golden rule.

There is therefore a prima

Monetary Superneutrality in a Fully Optimizing Macromodel
The

overlappin~generations

model is also a convenient vehicle for

analyzing the issue of superneutrality of money in an explictly optimizing
and fully rational model.

Superneutrality is the invariance of the trajec-

tories of the real variables of the economy under different proportional
rates of growth of the nominal money stock.

Money is defined as a non-

interest-bearing (nominally denominated) liability of the government that
has no "intrinsic value" in the sense that it is neither used as a consumption good, nor as an input in the productive process.

The two functions

performed by this financial~laim are the medium of exchange function and

For simplicity, I shall limit the analysis

to a consideration of the store of value function of money.

The anti-

superneutrality result obtained in the simpler model carries over to the
"~?re complex model considered by Carmichael.

Consider the introduction of

money in a""si?ple overlapping generations model without gifts, bequests or
interest-bearing government debt, in which the only other store of value
is real reproducible capital.

Since money balances are not desired for

their own sake but only for their purchasing power over real output, the
real rate of return on money balances is the negative of the expected
proportional rate of change of the price level -lip/p.

The conclusion that "equilibrium" and "rationality" do not imply "neutrality"
again emerges forcefully, as it did when debt neutrality was considered.

also leads to the conclusion that the ad hoc model of Section II is in many
ways an acceptable parable for the "purer" ~odels of Section III.

-48Sticky nominal prices and real effects of deterministic monetary
feedback rules
It is well-known that if a market is inefficient, in the sense that the
market price does not fully reflect all available information, pure nominal
shocks and disturbances, including anticipated changes in the money stock,
will have real effects.

The simple textbook IS-LMmode1 with its exogenously

fixed money wage and money price level is the best-known example.

With the

general price level given exogenously, an increase in the nominal stock of
money represents an equal proportional increase in the real stock of money
balances.

It may seem plausible to locate such inef-

ficiences primarily in the goods and factor markets, while treating the
financial markets as efficient, with financial asset prices or rates of return
always adjusting instantaneously to new information about current or anticipated
future events, so as to maintain equilibrium between demand and supply.

Interestingly,

-

someof the recent work by Stiglitz on non-market-c1earing equilibria and
the micro-foundations of price and wage-stickiness dealt with financial markets
(Stig1itz[1979]).

Imperfect, costly and asymmetric information characterize

personal and corporate credit markets and insurance markets as much as the
labor market, the housing market or the market in second-hand cars.

Work on

this subject by Arker10f [1970], Stiglitz [1979], Grossman [1976], Salop [1978],
Wilson [1979] and others shows how privately rational, optimizing behavior can
result in socially inefficient, quantity-constrained equilibria in which market
prices are "sticky" in the sense that they do not always respond to the existence of
excess demand or supply.

The simple linear stochastic model described below

imposes price rigidity, without explicitly deriving it, as Stiglitz has done,
as the [momentary] eaui1ibrium outcome of a process generated by optimizing

-49-

economic agents.

It is therefore ad hoc.

The assumption of instantaneous

and continuous competitive equilibrium, however, is equally ad hoc unless the
process is specified through which this miracle of coordination is achieved.
It is not enough to assert that all feasible trades that are to the perceived
mutual advantage of the exchanging parties must be exhausted.

What :needs to

be explained is how the price vector always assumes a value that renders
feasible, in the aggregate, actions that appear feasible at the micro-level when
each agent acts competitively.

The micro-foundations of competitive market

clearing are not yet well developed.

Essential ingredients are large numbers

of potential buyers and sellers, specialized middlemen or brokers, easy
identification of the relevant economic characteristics of the commodity in
question and other fundamental components of market structure such as the laws,
rules and regulations governing the exchange of property rights over the
commodity.

Equation IV.1 is a version of the "Lucas supply function."

Deviations of out-

Equation IV.2 models sluggish adjustment of the actual price level to

Two propositions emerge.

First, as long as the price level is not completely

inflexible (13)0), an unanticipated increase in the money supply will have a
larger effect on real output than an anticipated increase in the money supply.17/

-52-

Second, only if the price level is perfectly flexible (8=1), will anticipated
money supply changes have no effect on real output.

Even then, unanticipated

monetary disturbances will continue to have real effects.
Except for the recent papers by Stiglitz et al. most of the theoretical
work on wage and price rigidity can be characterized as [implicit] contract
theory

(Azariadis [1975], Baily [1974], Grossman [1978], Fischer [1977],

Phelps and Taylor [1977]).

Multi-period employment contracts are viewed as

mutually privately rational arrangements for shifting risk from risk-averse
workers to risk-neutral or less risk-averse capitalists.

Similarly, multi-

period price contracts between well established suppliers and customers can be
viewed as transactions and search cost minimizing as well as risk-sharing arrangements (Okun [1975]).

What is not clear is why optimal multi-period contracts

would set (i.e., predetermine) nominal wages or prices, thus assigning the role
of shock absorbers solely to quantities (employment and sales) (Barro [1979]).
A recent attempt to overcome some of the shortcomings of contract theory was made by
Hall [1979], who rationalizes wage and price stickiness by developing a theory
of the role of "prevailing prices and wages" in the efficient organization of
markets.
If prices can adjust to clear markets with the same frequency with which
new information accrues and with the same speed with which the monetary
authority can respond to any new information, monetary policy will enter the
ex>

i

reduced form for real output only via a term like i~o w (m _ - E(m t _i _ l $t-i-l)),
t i
i.e., via a series of one-period ahead forecast errors.

With multi-period

nominal contracts monetary policy will enter the reduced form for real output

Thus, if money wages

-53-

and prices are determined by a series of overlapping multi-period nominal
contracts and if the nominal money stock can be adjusted freely each period,
the information set available at the time of the current money supply decision
will in general be larger than the information sets that were available when most of
the currently prevailing money prices and wages were contracted for.

Given this differential ability to

influence real private sector behavior?

-55-

Changing the Structure of Private Sector Information
In a set of recent papers, Laurence Weiss [1979 a,b] has provided
another ingeneous argument for a role for active (feedback) monetary
policy in rational expectations models.

This role exists even if the

information sets of the private and public sectors are identical.

Let

is some subset of at.

We will write it as a linear

transformation L of at:
~t =

LOt·

We can, without loss of generality, assume L to be of full rank, although
it will not in general be a square matrix.

Since the public sector does

not hold an informational advantage over the private sector, it cannot
add or create additional private information, i.e., it cannot change the
rank of the matrix L.

It can, however, through feedback policy, change

the matrix L to a matrix L' that has the same rank but conveys information
that has a different economic impact.

An example will illustrate this.

Consider a decentralized competitive economy with many separated markets.
In any given period a trader is randomly assigned to a given market.
His demand or supply decision will depend on the relationship between
the current price in his own market and the average price expected to
prevail in the next period when he will be reassigned randomly to another
market.

All he observes in the current period is the price in his market.

There are two disturbances, an aggregate nominal disturbance common to
all markets, nt' and a market-specific real -dis~~rb~~~;, u~ in the ith

No information is added on balance:

Since the economic implications of observing u~ are different from those
of observing nt' this change in the structure of information can have
real consequences.

The Insufficiency of Prices in Sequence Economies With
Incomplete Markets and rational Expectations
There is an implication of the rational expectations approach that
seems to have been overlooked by its advocates.

One of the major virtues

of a market system is supposed to be the role played by prices determined
in efficient markets as effective aggregators of information.

Decentralized,

atomistic private agents need not worry about the myriad of other agents,
about their tastes, technologies and endowments.

All information necessary

for the optimal planning of consumption, production and sales is contained
in current market prices that are parametric to the individual agent.

If

-57-

markets are incomplete and expectations of future spot prices replace currently available prices established in forward markets, rational expectations are a strong reminder of the insufficiency of the price mechanism
for efficient resource allocation.

Rational expectations are optimal

forecasts based on the forecasting agent's knowledge of the true structure
of the economy.

They require knowledge of the underlying structural para-

meters of public and private sector preferences, technologies and endowments.
The local, partial nature of the knowledge provided by prices in a realworld market economy with incomplete markets, means that additional global,
economy-wide informational demands are made on private agents with rational
expectations.

Such informational demands are often dismissed as unrealistic

when central planning is discussed.

The informational requirements of

central planning are no different from the informational requirements of
"decentralized" rational expectations models of sequence economies with
incomplete markets.

Conclusion

The "New Classical Macroeconomics" has

forced a thorough reval-

uation of the theoretical and empirical foundations of
conventional wisdom.

After the rhetoric

~s

Neo-Keynesian

stripped away, how-

ever, the analytical implications of the New Classical Macroeconomics are
surprisingly familar to neo-Keynesians.

Substitution of debt financing

for tax financing crowds out saving in the short run and lowers the capitallabor ratio in the long run.

A higher, fully anticipated rate of growth

of the money supply will not be super-neutral and is likely cet. par. to be

-58-

associated with a higher steady state capital-labor ratio.

Monetary feed-

back rules will alter the trajectories of real economic variables.

This

confirmation of the importance of monetary, fiscal and financial policy
for the cyclical and the long-run behavior of the real economy is not necessarily a source of comfort.

After all, "policy neutrality" would be most

welcome when the conduct of policy is erratic, confusing or incompetent.
No such easy escape is available to the policy maker; policy can stabilize
and it can destabilize, it can promote growth and prosperity or destroy it.

FOOTNOTES
1/

Government capital formation is ignored for simplicity.

2/ Since labor supply and consumption decisions are jointly determined
by-the household's intertemporal utility maximization program, the consumption function and labor supply function should have the same arguments.
Choosing the more standard (ad hoc) specifications of equations 11.3 and
11.13 does not affect the argument.

1/

Depreciation is ignored.

4/ This neutrality proposition can be interpreted in one of the two
following ways. (a) Compare the solution trajectories for two economies,
identical in all respects except that the nominal stock of money in country
2 M2 (t) exceeds that in country 1, Ml(t) by a fixed fraction: M2 (t) =
M1(t)(1+a), a > O~ for all t. In economy 2 the equilibrium solutions for
the price level p (t) and the money wage, w2 (t), will ~xceed those in
c~untry 1, pl(tl and wl(t), by the same fraction a. p (t) = (l+a) pl(t);
w (t) = (l+a) w (t). All real variables are the same. (b) Consider the
solution trajectory of a given economy before and after an unanticipated
change in the money supply at t=T. Let the money supply up to T be Ml(t).
Until t=T, economic agents expect the money supply to follow Ml(t) indefintely into the future. At T the actual and anticipated money supply
path becomes MZ(t) = Ml(t)(l+a), a > 0 for t ~ T. If there is this
unancipated chang at t = T in the money stock process, the price level
path after T is p (t) = (l+a)p!(t), t ~ T. Here p!(t) is the price level
path that would have prevailed at and beyond t=T, had no unanticipated
change in the money supply occurred at t=T.

We already make the assumption (explicit in III.53c) that both money and
capital are held and that the private saver will get the same rate of return on
his saving, no matter how he divides it between money and real capital.
16/
Equation IV.2 is only reasonable in an economy without an inflationary or
deflationary trend. If there is a trend in the price level (but not in the rate
of inflation), IV.2 can be modified to:
(Pt-Pt-l) - (Pt-l-Pt-2) = B(p*t-P t-l-(Pt-l- P t-2»
17/
TI1is is not a general property of rational expectations models. Bailey
(1978) provides examples of anticipated fiscal policy having greater "bang per
