    "abstract": "\n\nShort run gravity is a geometric weighted average of long run gravity and bilateral capacity. The model features (i) joint trade costs endogenous to bilateral volumes,  (ii)  long run gravity as a limiting case of efficient investment in bilateral capacities,  (iii) a structural  ratio of short run to long run trade elasticities equal to a micro-founded buyers' incidence elasticity, and (iv) tractable short  and long run models of the extensive margin. Application to manufacturing trade of 52 countries during the globalization period 1988-2006 strongly supports the model. Results  solve several time invariance and trade elasticity puzzles in the literature.\n\n",
