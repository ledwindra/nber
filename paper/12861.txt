ABSTRACT
We study the implications for international relative prices of a simple Ricardian model of international
trade with imperfect competition and variable markups, providing a tractable account of firm-level
and aggregate prices. We show that both trade costs and imperfect competition with variable markups
are needed to account for pricing-to-market at the firm and aggregate levels. We also show that international
trade costs are essential, but pricing-to-market is not, to account for a high volatility of tradeable consumer
prices relative to the overall CPI-based real-exchange rate.

Following Marc Melitz (2003) and Andrew Bernard, Jonathan Eaton, J. Bradford Jensen,
and Samuel Kortum (2003) (BEJK), recent research on international trade has studied models in which comparative advantage is derived from Ricardian technological diﬀerences across
firms or plants rather than across countries. These models emphasize the role of trade costs
in accounting for trade patterns and allow for imperfect competition with variable markups.
In our recent research (see Atkeson and Burstein 2006), we study the ability of a model
with technological diﬀerences across firms, trade costs, and imperfect competition with variable markups to account quantitatively for several important features of the behavior of
fluctuations in international relative prices. In that paper, we present a model that, when
parameterized to match some of the main features of the data on trade volumes at both
the aggregate and firm level and to have reasonable implications for both the concentration
of production among producers in a market and the distribution of markups of price over
marginal cost, reproduces many of the main features of the data on the fluctuations in the
relative producer and consumer prices of tradeable and traded goods.
In this paper, we present a simplified version of our model based on that presented
in BEJK to provide an analytically more tractable account of the role of trade costs and
imperfect competition with variable markups in accounting for international relative prices
that is useful for classroom discussion. In particular, this model provides a simple and
intuitive account of the decision of individual exporting firms to practice pricing-to-market
1

– that is, to change the relative price at which they sell their output at home and abroad in
response to a change in the relative costs of production at home and abroad. This simplified
model is less appropriate for quantitative work than the model in Atkeson and Burstein
(2006) largely because its implications for pricing are not robust to small changes in market
structure. In particular, the pricing implications of the model are not continuous with respect
to the elasticity of substitution between the output of competing firms – these implications
are very diﬀerent when firms’ outputs are perfect substitutes rather than near, but imperfect,
substitutes.
In this paper we focus on the implications of our simplified model for two features of the
data on international relative prices. The first feature of the data is the observation that,
for the major developed economies, the international relative producer price of manufactured (tradeable) goods is roughly twice as volatile as the corresponding terms of trade for
manufactured goods (see Atkeson and Burstein 2006 for a full review of these data). In our
model, the international relative producer price of tradeable goods moves in response to a
change in relative production costs across countries simply because each country specializes
in the production of a distinct set of goods. What is more diﬃcult to reproduce in the
model is the observation that this change in relative production costs across countries leads
to a substantially smaller movement in the terms of trade. Algebraically, this can be the
case only if there are systematic fluctuations in the ratio of export prices to home country
producer prices and the ratio of import prices to source country producer prices for tradeable
goods. Specifically, an increase in the home marginal cost relative to foreign marginal costs
leads to an increase in home producer prices relative to export prices. In this model, these
fluctuations arise as a result of individual firms’ decisions to price-to-market.
The second feature of the data that we study is the finding that for many developed
economies there appears to be little or no diﬀerence in the magnitude of the fluctuations in
the international relative consumer price of the basket of goods that are considered tradeable
and the magnitude of the fluctuations in overall consumer price index based real exchange
rates (CPI-based RER). This observation that the fluctuations in the international relative
consumer price of tradeable goods are nearly as large as fluctuations in CPI-based RER
themselves holds both at short and long horizons (see, for example, Charles Engel 1999).
This finding has been presented as an important challenge in open economy macroeconomics
2

since it suggests that international arbitrage through international trade plays only a very
limited role in mitigating the fluctuations in international relative consumer prices at the
macroeconomic level.
We present two main results from our model. First, we show that both trade costs and
imperfect competition with variable markups are needed to account for pricing-to-market at
the firm and aggregate level. Second, we show that international trade costs are essential,
but pricing-to-market is not, to account for a high volatility of tradeable consumer prices
relative to the overall CPI-based RER.
I. Model
We develop a model in which two symmetric countries (indexed by i) produce and trade
a continuum of goods subject to frictions in international goods markets. Our approach
is partial equilibrium in the sense that we take as given movements in the relative cost of
production across countries and ask what changes in the consumer and producer prices of
goods should result from these changes in costs. We do not address the general equilibrium
question of what shocks lead to these large and persistent changes in costs and prices across
countries. Compared to the model studied in Atkeson and Burstein (2006), we assume that
varieties within a sector are perfect substitutes (ρ = ∞, in the notation of that paper), and
we also abstract from the fixed costs of exporting, so international trade is only driven by
considerations of comparative advantage. We also consider two types of competition: perfect
competition and Bertrand competition.
Final consumption, ci , is a composite of final tradeable good consumption, cTi , and final
¡ T ¢γ ¡ N ¢1−γ
non-tradeable good consumption, cN
. The final tradeable and
ci
i , given by ci = ci

non-tradeable goods are each produced by a competitive firm using a continuum of varieties
j subject to a standard CES production function. In each country, those varieties that are

used to produce the final tradeable good are indexed by j ∈ [0, 1], and those that are used
to produce the final non-tradeable good are indexed by j ∈ (1, 2]. The production function
for the final tradeable good is given by
cTi

1−1/η

(yij )

,

and likewise for the final non-tradeable good using varieties j ∈ (1, 2]. Profit maximization
by the final goods producers gives standard CES demand functions with an elasticity of
3

demand determined by η.
In each country i, there are K potential producers of each of these varieties, giving a
total of 2 × K potential producers of each variety in the world. These potential producers
of each variety have technologies to produce the same good with diﬀerent marginal costs.
Specifically, each potential producer has a constant returns production technology of the
form y = zl, where l is labor and z is a productivity realization that is idiosyncratic to that
producer. Tradeable and non-tradeable varieties are distinguished by the cost of trading
them internationally: for tradeable varieties j ∈ [0, 1] there is an iceberg trade cost indexed
by D ≥ 1 to ship these varieties between countries, while for non-tradeable varieties j ∈ (1, 2],
international trade is prohibitively costly. Hence, the marginal cost of supplying one unit
of a tradeable variety in country 1 for a domestic firm with productivity z is W1 /z. The
marginal cost for a supplier of country 2 with the same productivity z to sell in country 1 is
DW2 /z. Note that D = 1 corresponds to the case of costless international trade of tradeable
varieties.
A. Perfect Competition
Under perfect competition, the final goods producers in each country i purchase each
variety from the lowest cost supplier of that good to that country, and the price charged for
that variety is the marginal cost of that lowest cost supplier. So, the price of sector j in
country i is given by Pij = c1ij , where c1ij is the marginal cost of the lowest cost producer
among the 2K potential suppliers of this variety j to this country i. For imported varieties,
this marginal cost is the marginal cost of production scaled up by the international trade
cost D. Clearly, for the non-tradeable varieties, with D = ∞, the lowest cost provider
is always domestic and the price is equal to the marginal cost of that producer. With
these assumptions, our model is similar to the Rudiger Dornbusch, Stanley Fisher, and Paul
Samuelson (1977) Ricardian model of trade with a continuum of goods. The extent to which
tradeable varieties are traded depends on the balancing of the trading cost D ≥ 1 and the
dispersion of idiosyncratic productivities z.
B. Bertrand Competition
Under Bertrand competition, the final goods producer in each country i purchases each
intermediate good from the lowest cost supplier of that good to that country, just as under
perfect competition, but the price charged is the minimum of the monopoly price for the
4

lowest cost supplier and the marginal cost of the second lowest cost supplier of that good to
that country. This is the key distinction between Bertrand and perfect competition: under
Bertrand competition there is no fixed relationship between the price of each intermediate
good and the marginal cost of the supplier of that good.
To model Bertrand competition, let ckij denote the marginal cost of the kth lowest cost supo
n

plier (k = 1 or 2) of sector j to country i. Then, the price is given by Pij = min cij , η−1 cij .
In defining the term pricing-to-market, we consider the prices charged by a single producer
cij be the percentage change in the
of a traded variety j in two diﬀerent locations. Let P

price of variety j in country i. Here a hat on a variable indicates the log change of the
³
´
c
variable. Our measure of pricing-to-market at the firm level is Pc
1j − P2j . It reflects the
extent to which deviations from the law of one price arise from the pricing decision of a

single producer supplying diﬀerent locations as opposed to the pricing decisions of diﬀerent
producers supplying diﬀerent locations.
II. Aggregate Prices

ci , as the driving
We consider aggregate shocks to the marginal cost of production, W

force behind fluctuations in international relative prices.1 We measure changes in aggregate

price indices in our model using the same methodology used by Bureau of Labor Statistics

(BLS) accountants in constructing consumer, producer, and export and import price indices.
Specifically, we consider expenditure weighted averages of price changes for individual varieties and use expenditure shares from the symmetric equilibrium (i.e. W1 = W2 = 1). In this
section, we derive expressions for the change in aggregate price indices in response to a small
change in relative wages across countries using a first order approximation. Because there are
a finite number of potential producers of each variety (K), each with distinct productivities,
the identities of the firms that produce and sell in each country do not change in response to
a suﬃciently small change in relative wages, under both perfect and Bertrand competition.
Later, when we compute the changes in prices numerically, we account for the switches in
the identities of producing firms using the methodology used by the BLS to construct price
1

We can think of them as arising from a productivity shock or from a change in the nominal exchange

rate in a model with sticky nominal wages. In our model we do not need to specify the underlying source of
the aggregate shock to relative costs across countries to compute the change in prices.

indices.2
The first-order approximations to the change in aggregate price indices in response to a
small change in relative wages are as follows. The change in logarithm in the export price
index in country 1 (import price index for country 2), covering prices that domestic firms

sM {tradeable j exported by 1}

Here sij denotes the symmetric equilibrium expenditure share of variety j over total tradeable
consumption in country i, and sM is the share of tradeables expenditure on imports. This
import share sM is given by the integral of s2j across all varieties j imported by country 2
from country 1, and symmetry makes it equal in both countries. The definition of the import
d

I1 for country 1, covering prices that foreign firms charge for domestic sales,

is symmetric.
Let Pd
P I1T denote the change in the producer price index of tradeable goods in country

In particular, in constructing the consumer price index, if the identity of the firm selling a particular

variety in a particular country changes in response to the change in relative wages, we substitute the price
charged by the new firm for that of the old (using the logic that the BLS looks for close substitutes if the
original good is not available). On the other hand, in constructing the producer and export price indices,
varieties for which the identity of the producer changes in response to the change in relative wages are not
included in the relevant price index (or equivalently, we attribute to this variety the rate of change in the
overall price index).

for those tradeable varieties j that are produced and consumed in country 1. Similarly,

Given these results and a choice of the share of tradeables in overall consumption γ, one can
7

compute the movement in the relative consumer price of tradeable goods as a fraction of the
overall movement in the CPI-based RER using (5).
B. Bertrand Competition
The logic of pricing under Bertrand competition is quite diﬀerent from that under perfect
competition because pricing is determined by the costs of the second lowest cost supplier
of a good. We refer to this second lowest cost supplier as the latent competitor. For all
cij = W
ci as under perfect
non-tradeable varieties, the latent competitor is domestic, so P

competition. For tradeable varieties, however, the latent competitor can be local or located
abroad.

To understand pricing under Bertrand and perfect competition, it is useful to group
tradeable varieties purchased in each country into four categories: (1) varieties that are
produced locally and priced at the marginal cost of a local latent competitor (we denote
the symmetric equilibrium share of this category of goods in tradeable goods consumption
by sLL ), (2) varieties that are produced abroad and priced at the marginal cost of a latent
competitor that is also located abroad (share sMM ), (3) varieties produced locally but priced
at the cost of a latent competitor abroad (share sLM ), and (4) varieties produced abroad
but priced at the cost of a local latent competitor (share sML ). Locally produced products
priced at the monopoly markup of η/(η − 1) are included in sLL while imported varieties
priced at this markup are included in sMM . Using these shares, we can express the import
share as sM = sMM + sML , and the expenditure share on local goods as 1 − sM = sLL + sLM .
Note that, in a symmetric equilibrium, these shares do not vary across countries.
In country 1, for varieties in categories (1) or (4) (with latent competitors in country 1),
c
Pc
1j = W1 , and for varieties in categories (2) and (3) (with latent competitors in country 2),

c

c
Pc
1j = W2 . By symmetry, in country 2, for varieties in categories (1) or (4), P2j = W2 , and
c
for varieties in categories (2) and (3), Pc
2j = W1 .
Pricing-to-market at the firm level under Bertrand competition can be understood as

follows. Consider the pricing of a variety j that is produced in country 1 and exported to

country 2. For a portion of such varieties, the producer will face the same latent competitor
as the second lowest cost supplier in both markets. If that latent competitor is located in
c
c
c
c
country 1, then Pc
1j = P2j = W1 , while if that competitor is in country 2, then P1j = P2j =
c2 . In either of these cases, there is no pricing-to-market at the firm level since Pc
c
W
1j = P2j .
8

For the remainder of those varieties that are produced in country 1 and actually traded,
the producer faces a local latent competitor when selling in country 1 and a foreign latent
c

competitor when selling in country 2. Hence, Pc
1j = W1 and P2j = W2 . For these varieties,

there is pricing-to-market at the firm level since Pc

apply for exporters located in country 2.

Again, one can compute the movement in the relative consumer price of tradeable goods as
a fraction of the overall movement in the CPI-based RER using (5).
III. Discussion
With this model, we establish two main results. The first is the analytical result that
both imperfect competition with variable markups and trade costs are required for pricingto-market at the firm and aggregate levels. If either element of the model is missing, then
there is no such pricing-to-market. The second result is a quantitative result that, under
Bertrand competition, pricing-to-market does not contribute substantially to the relative
volatility of tradeable consumer prices and the overall CPI-based RER.
Consider first the result that both imperfect competition with variable markups and
trade costs are required for pricing-to-market. It is clear that imperfect competition with
variable markups is required for pricing-to-market at the firm level. Moreover, our aggregate
measure of pricing-to-market is always equal to 1 under perfect competition – so there is
9

no aggregate pricing-to-market, and it is less than 1 under Bertrand competition, from (10),
as long as sML (1 − sM ) < sLM sM .
The result that trade costs (D > 1) are also required for pricing-to-market under Bertrand
competition is more subtle. Without trade costs (D = 1), every tradeables firm that produces
also exports and faces the same latent competitor both on domestic sales and on exports.
c
Hence, Pc
1j = P2j for all tradeable varieties j, and there is no pricing-to-market at the firm

level. Moreover, our aggregate measure of pricing-to-market in (10) is equal to 1 just as
under perfect competition.3

It is worth noting, however, that with Bertrand competition we do not need trade costs
to have imperfect pass-through of costs to traded goods prices. If sML > 0, i.e., some
exporting firms face foreign latent competitors and hence do not pass through changes in
their domestic production costs, we see from (7) that export and import prices each reflect
both domestic and foreign costs, even without trade costs. The extent of pass-through under
Bertrand competition depends on the extent of national comparative advantage as measured
by the share of exporters with latent competitors that are located in the same country.
When national comparative advantage is strong in the sense that all exporters face a latent
competitor in their home country, so that sML = 0, then from (7) we have that export and
import price indices move just as they do under perfect competition. In contrast, when
national comparative advantage is weak relative to the magnitude of trade costs in the sense
that all exporters face latent competitors abroad, so that sMM = 0, then export and import
prices move in exactly the opposite direction as under perfect competition. In general, under
Bertrand competition, our model predicts higher pass-through of costs to import prices if
exporters to a country do not face much local competition (low sML /sM ).
Note that in our model, prices are set optimally every period and not fixed by assumption.
Thus, our model illustrates that the evidence of persistent pricing-to-market and persistent
deviations of relative PPP can be rationalized under flexible prices if the underlying movements in international relative costs are suﬃciently persistent.
3

This aggregate result can be seen as follows. In this case, all tradeable goods firms face the same latent

competitor and set equal prices on domestic sales and on exports, which implies sM M = sLL . Under D = 1
we also have sM = 0.5, which, combined with the definitions sM = sMM + sML and 1 − sM = sLL + sLM ,

implies sLM = sML . We therefore have sML /sM = 2sML = sLM + sML and using (10) we obtain the result.

10

We now consider the model’s implications for the movement in the consumer prices for
tradeable goods relative to the movement in the overall CPI-based RER. We begin with an
analytical result. If the expenditure share on imported goods priced at the cost of a domestic
latent competitor is equal to the expenditure share on domestically produced goods priced at
the cost of a foreign latent competitor (sML = sLM ), then the fraction of movements in the
CPI-based RER accounted for by changes in the relative consumer price of tradeable goods is
the same under perfect or Bertrand competition despite the diﬀerent logic of pricing. Under
perfect competition, the movement in the CPI for tradeable goods is a weighted average of
the movements in underlying domestic and foreign marginal costs with the weights given
by the share of imports in final consumption. Under Bertrand competition, foreign costs
impact the domestic CPI for tradeable goods to the extent that some consumption goods
have foreign latent competitors. If sML = sLM , then the share of consumption goods with
foreign latent competitors (sMM + sLM ) is equal to the import share (sMM + sML ). So, in
this case, the fraction of the CPI-based RER fluctuations accounted for by movements in
the relative consumer price of tradeable goods is equal under either form of competition.
Equivalently, in this case we can say that pricing-to-market and imperfect pass-through play
no role in accounting for the fraction of the CPI-based RER fluctuations accounted for by
movements in the relative consumer price of tradeable goods.
This analytical result can be understood as follows, thinking about the pricing of each
individual tradeable variety. The deviations from relative PPP for those varieties that are
actually traded that occur under Bertrand competition contribute to the fluctuations in the
relative price of tradeable goods. Bertrand competition introduces an oﬀsetting eﬀect not
present with perfect competition, however, for the prices of tradeable varieties that are not
traded. Under perfect competition, for all tradeable varieties that are produced in country
c
1 and not exported, Pc
1j = W1 , while for those produced in country 2 and not exported,
c
c
c
c
c
Pc
2j = W2 . Hence, for all tradeable varieties that are not traded P1j − P2j = W1 − W2 .

Under Bertrand competition, the pricing of tradeable varieties that are not traded is still
determined by the cost of the latent competitor, and this competitor can be located in either

country. Hence, for those varieties produced in country 1 and not exported, a fraction face
c
local latent competition and hence have Pc
1j = W1 , while the remainder face foreign latent
c
competition and have Pc
1j = W2 . Applying the same argument to producers in country 2
11

who do not export, we get that, on average, the fluctuations in the relative price of those
tradeable varieties that are not actually traded is smaller under Bertrand competition than it
is under perfect competition. The pricing of tradeable varieties that are not actually traded
contributes to smaller fluctuations in the relative price of tradeable goods under Bertrand
competition. To the extent that sLM ' sML , the eﬀects of Bertrand competition on pricingto-market of tradeable varieties that are actually traded and on the pricing of tradeable
varieties that are not actually traded oﬀset when aggregated to determine the fluctuations
in the overall relative consumer price of tradeable goods.
Without further assumptions, there is no presumption in our model that sLM ' sML . We
now explore the implications of a simple quantitative example.
A. Quantitative Example
We consider an example in which the share of tradeable goods in overall consumption
is γ = 0.4, the elasticity of substitution between varieties is η = 3, and the number of
potential competitors per variety in each country is K = 20. Firm productivities z within
each variety are independently drawn from a lognormal distribution with variance θ2 . The
parameters K and θ control the dispersion of idiosyncratic productivities z within a variety.
Given D, a higher K or a lower θ leads to a smaller number of exporters. In this example,
we calibrate θ for an arbitrary choice of K. Atkeson and Burstein (2006) calibrate K and θ
to match facts on industry concentration. We choose the parameters θ and D so that, in a
symmetric equilibrium, the trade share is sM = 16.5 percent,4 and the fraction of tradeable
firms that export is 25 percent.5 The choice of these two parameters under Perfect and
Bertrand competition are D = 1.503, θ = 0.66, and D = 1.7, θ = 0.875, respectively. Under
Bertrand competition, expenditure shares by latent competitor are sLL = 75.1 percent ,
sLM = 8.4 percent, sML = 7.5 percent, and sMM = 9.0 percent.
The following table reports the results to changes in the wage rate in country 1 of various
c1 = 0.001 percent also correspond to those using the expressions from
sizes (the results for W

the first-order approximation). Two results emerge from this example. First, the model

output between 1987 and 2003 (see Atkeson and Burstein 2006).

This is roughly the fraction of exporters in total plants in the US manufacturing sector between 1987
and 1992 (see Bernard and Jensen 2004).

produces substantial aggregate pricing-to-market under Bertrand competition. Note that
pricing-to-market is less pronounced after a larger increase in W1 . This is because after a
large shock to wages in country 1, it is more likely that those firms in sML and sLM – those
facing latent competitors from abroad – switch export status. But note that even after a
shock as large as 40 percent, we still get substantial aggregate pricing-to-market. Second,
the fraction of the movement in the CPI-based RER accounted for by a change in the relative
consumer price of tradeable goods does not vary substantially with the form of competition.6
This is because, in our quantitative example, sLM is quite close to sML .7

The model produces larger movement in the relative consumer price of tradeable goods, closer to the US

data, if we include non-tradeable distribution costs that are half the cost of the consumer price of tradeable
goods.

The diﬀerence between sLM and sML is even smaller if we instead assume that z is exponentially
distributed.
