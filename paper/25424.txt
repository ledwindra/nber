Capital Requirements in a Quantitative Model of Banking Industry Dynamics
Dean Corbae and Pablo D'Erasmo
NBER Working Paper No. 25424
January 2019
JEL No. E44,G21,L11
ABSTRACT
We develop a model of banking industry dynamics to study the quantitative impact of capital
requirements on equilibrium bank risk taking, commercial bank failure, interest rates on loans,
and market structure. We propose a market structure where big banks with market power interact
with small, competitive fringe banks. Banks face idiosyncratic funding shocks in addition to
aggregate shocks to the fraction of performing loans in their portfolio. A nontrivial bank size
distribution arises out of endogenous entry and exit, as well as banks' buffer stock of net worth.
We show the model predictions are consistent with untargeted business cycle properties, the bank
lending channel, and empirical studies of the role of concentration on financial stability. We then
conduct a series of counterfactuals (including countercyclical and size contingent (e.g. SIFI)
capital requirements). We find that regulatory policies can have an important impact on market
structure in the banking industry which, along with selection effects, can generate changes in
allocative efficiency.

Introduction

The banking literature has focused on two main functions of bank capital. First, because
of limited liability and deposit insurance, banks have an incentive to engage in risk shifting.
Requiring banks to hold a minimum ratio of capital to assets constrains the banks’ ability to
take risk. Second, bank capital acts like a buffer that may offset losses and save its charter
value. In this paper, we develop a quantitative model of banking industry dynamics with
imperfect competition and an endogenous size distribution of banks to answer the following
question: How much does an increase in capital requirements affect failure rates, interest
rates, and market shares of large and small banks?
As Figure 1 makes clear, the number of commercial banks in the U.S. has fallen from over
11,000 in 1984 to under 5000 in 2016 while the asset market share of the top 10 banks has
grown from 27.2% in 1984 to 58.3% in 2016. Rising market shares of big banks motivates us to
consider a model of the banking industry that allows for imperfect competition. Furthermore,
it allows us to understand how regulatory policy may affect market structure as well as
consider how market structure influences risk taking behavior that regulators are attempting
to mitigate.

In an earlier paper (Corbae and D’Erasmo [23]), we endogenized market structure, but
limited the asset side of the bank balance sheet to loans and the liabilities side to deposits
and equity. While loans and deposits are clearly the largest components of each side of the
balance sheet of U.S. banks, this simplification does not admit ways for banks to insure
themselves at a cost through precautionary holdings of lower risk, highly liquid assets like
cash and securities such as T-bills.
In this paper, we still work with an endogenous market structure but extend the portfolio
of bank assets in the above direction. Further we assume that banks are randomly matched
with depositors and that these matches follow a Markov process that is independently distributed across banks. Thus, we add fluctuations in deposits and other sources of funds
(which we term “funding shocks”) to the model of the first paper.
We assume banks have limited liability. At the end of the period, banks may choose
to exit in the event of cash shortfalls if their charter value is not sufficiently valuable. If a
bank’s charter value is sufficiently valuable, banks can use their stock of net securities as a
buffer or issue seasoned equity. Thus, the extension allows us to consider banks undertaking
precautionary savings in the face of idiosyncratic shocks as in a household income fluctuations
problem, but with a strategic twist, since here, big banks have loan market power.
We “test” the model by showing its predictions are qualitatively consistent with untargeted data moments and empirical studies. First, in Subsection 6.2, we show the model’s
business cycle predictions are qualitatively consistent with untargeted data correlations. Second, in Subsection 6.3 we show the model’s predictions for lending across banks of different
sizes in response to a rise in the cost of external funding are qualititatively consistent with the
predictions from an important set of papers by Kashyap and Stein ([46],[47]). Kashyap and
Stein studied whether the impact of Fed policy on lending behavior is stronger for banks with
less liquid balance sheets (where balance sheet strength is measured as the ratio of securities
plus federal funds sold to total assets). The mechanism they test relies on the idea that (see
[46] p. 410) “banks with large values of this ratio should be better able to buffer their lending
activity against shocks in the availability of external finance, by drawing on their stock of
liquid assets.” One of their measures of monetary policy is the federal funds rate. They find
strong evidence of an effect for small banks (those in the bottom 95% of the distribution).
In this section, we conduct an analogous exercise by running a similar regression on panel
data generated by our model and find that the results are qualitatively consistent with the
empirical evidence presented in Kashyap and Stein [46]. Third, in Subsection 6.4 we show
the model’s predictions are qualitatively consistent with the large empirical literature on the
competition-stability tradeoff along the lines of Beck, et. al. [11], Berger, et. al. [12], and
Jiang, et. al. [44]. Our model generates endogenous changes in market structure that are
correlated with cyclical changes in financial stability and intermediated output.
A benefit of our structural framework is that we can conduct policy counterfactuals. In
Subsection 7.1 we study a rise in level of capital requirements from 4% under Basel II to
8.5% (corresponding to the required minimum risk weighted capital requirement of 6% plus
a 2.5% capital conservation buffer) motivated by changes recommended by Basel III. FDIC
Rules and Regulations (Part 325) establishes the criteria and standards to calculate capital
requirements and adequacy (see DSC Risk Management Manual of Examination Policies,

2

FDIC, Capital (12-04)).1
We find that a rise in capital requirements from 4% to 8.5% actually leads to an increase
in long run exit rates of small banks from the model’s long run benchmark of 2.31% to
5.48% and a more concentrated industry. In the short run, big banks decide to strategically
gain loan market share financed by issuing more equity, cutting dividends, shifting out of
securities, and retaining more earnings. This results in a short run loss of market share of
fringe banks of 22% and a long run loss of 5%. Most of these changes in fringe banks market
share are explained by a drop in the number (measure) of fringe banks in the economy but
the intensive margin also responds negatively. The increase in exit rates by small banks
can be explained by a drop in their profitability. The high equity issuance costs that these
banks face forces them to shift towards securities (i.e., reduce lending) in order to achieve
higher capital ratios. This change in portfolio composition leads to lower profits (and charter
values) and an increase in the likelihood of exit.
The net effect of higher big bank lending and lower small bank lending is a decrease in
aggregate lending of over 16% in the short run and nearly 1% in the long run. This leads to
an increase in interest rates on loans of 142 basis points in the short run but only a modest
6 basis points in the long run. Higher interest rates lead to lower intermediated output
(16% in the short run and only 1% in the long run), but lower costs of funding failed banks
relative to output in the long run (-12%). While we do not model explicitly the behavior
of the non-bank sector (sometimes called the “shadow banking” sector), borrowers in the
model have access to an outside option that determines the commercial banking sector loan
demand. This margin of adjustment captures the effect of regulation on the size of the
regulated banking sector.
Another proposal in Basel III calls for large, systemically important financial institutions
(SIFI) to face a higher capital requirement than small banks. In Subsection 7.2 we run a
counterfactual where the capital requirement is 2% higher on big banks than small banks.2
Basel III also calls for banks to maintain a “countercyclical” capital buffer of up to 2.5% of
risk-based Tier 1 capital. As explained in BIS [17] the aim of the “countercyclical” buffer
is to use a buffer of capital to protect the banking sector from periods of excess aggregate
credit growth and potential future losses. According to Basel III, a buffer of 2.5% will be
in place only during periods of credit expansion.3 Implementation in the U.S. restricted the
application of the countercyclical capital buffer only to large banks. In Subsection 7.3 we
run a counterfactual where the capital requirement for big banks increases by 2.5% during
periods of economic expansion, so the capital requirement for these banks fluctuates between
8.5% and 11% (it is constant at 8.5% for all other banks).
In order to determine the case for any capital requirement at all, in Subsection 7.4 we
assess the implications of removing capital requirements entirely. As expected, both big and
small banks hold a lower buffer of capital but it is still non-zero since they provide a buffer
to maintain the bank’s charter value. Interestingly, the big bank strategically lowers loan

The SIFI surcharge is 2.5% for Citi and JP Morgan, 2% for BoA HSBC, Deutsche and HSBC, 1.5% for
Wells Fargo, Goldman, Barclays and 1% for other large banks.

of other variables that may be useful indicators such as asset prices, spreads and real GDP growth.

supply in order to raise interest rates and profitability. Higher profitability raises entry rates
by fringe banks.
In Subsection 7.5 we examine how the imposition of liquidity requirements affects market structure. Basel III requires bank to hold enough high quality liquid assets to sustain
significant losses (stress) for at least one month. We implement this by requiring that banks
hold safe assets to cover at least 8% of its expected outflows in the worst case scenario.
We also study a counterfactual that analyzes the interaction between liquidity and capital
requirements in Subsection 7.6. Interestingly, we find that capital requirements and liquidity requirements have large complementary effects. When both policies are implemented
together, the probability of a banking crisis declines to one third of its original value. This
change is considerably larger than the sum of the changes that can be attained by implementing each policy in isolation.
To understand the interaction between regulatory policy and market structure, we also
conduct a counterfactual where we increase the entry cost for dominant banks to a level that
prevents their entry. Since our benchmark model with dominant and fringe banks nests an
environment with only perfect competition, we can use this counterfactual to understand
the role of imperfect competition on the banking sector in Subsection 7.7.
In Subsection 7.8 we examine the implications of policy changes for allocative efficiency
in the banking industry. We use an analogue of the Olley and Pakes [55] decomposition
to assess how the costs of operating banks varies with policy. We find that there can be
increases in allocative efficiency arising from selection effects induced by the alternative
policies. Specifically, a large fraction (40% on average) of the decline in loan-weighted costs
can be explained by an increase in allocative efficiency.
We complete the paper in subsection 7.9 by analyzing the welfare effects of rising capital
and liquidity requirements. Assessing welfare gains and losses using consumption equivalents,
we find large short-term losses but modest long-term gains for households associated with
the counterfactuals we undertake in the previous sections.

Related Literature

Our paper is related to the literature studying the impact of financial regulation in quantitative structural models of banking. The first strand of literature studies dynamic bank
decision problems. For example, De Nicolo et al. [28] show an inverted U-shaped relationship
between capital requirements and bank lending. On the other hand, since they study only a
decision problem, they do not consider the impact of such policies on loan interest rates and
the equilibrium bank size distribution.
The second strand of literature studies dynamic general equilibrium models with a representative bank under perfect competition in loan and deposit markets. Van Den Heuvel
[63] was one of the first to study the welfare impact of capital requirements with perfect
competition.4 In these papers, constant returns and perfect competition imply that there is
an indeterminate distribution of bank sizes, so they do not make predictions for how regulation affects banking industry market structure. Others with perfect competition assume

idiosyncratic shocks which can generate an endogenous size distribution of banks.5 In such
models, big banks have no impact on lending or deposit rates and technically the failure of
an individual big bank has no market impact (since it is of measure zero).
Diamond’s [27] delegated monitoring model provides a foundation for the existence of
large banks due to economies of scale in monitoring. There are numerous empirical papers
documenting the existence of scale economies in banking such as Berger and Hannan [14]
or Berger and Mester [15].6 Following deregulation of the banking industry in the 1990s,
there was a wave of bank mergers which took advantage of scale economies resulting in loan
(deposit) market concentration of the top 10 going from 29.8% (25.8%) in 1984 to 54.7%
(57.3%) in 2016.
Given high concentration in the banking industry, another branch of the literature considers imperfect competition in loan and/or deposit markets. Our dynamic banking industry
model builds upon the static framework of Allen and Gale [5] and Boyd and DeNicolo [18].
In those models, there is an exogenous number of banks that are Cournot competitors either in the loan and/or deposit market. Martinez-Miera and Repullo [50] also consider a
dynamic model of Cournot competition, but do not endogenize the number of banks. Given
both aggregate productivity and idiosyncratic funding shocks, we endogenize the number of
banks by considering dynamic entry and exit decisions and apply a version of the Markov
perfect equilibrium concept in Ericson and Pakes [33] augmented with a competitive fringe
as in Gowrisankaran and Holmes [39]. While ours is the first quantitative structural model
to focus on imperfect competition in loan markets, there is also an important set of papers analyzing imperfect competition in the deposit market (see for example Aguirregabiria,
Clark, and Wang [2], and Egan, Hortascu, and Matvos [34]). We focus on loan markets since
in the recent financial crisis, aggregate bank risk weighted asset accumulation (including
loans) grew at an annual 8.5% rate in 2006 while they shrank at a −4.3% rate in 2009 at
the same time that aggregate bank borrowings (including deposits) grew at an annual 10.9%
rate in 2006 while they shrank at a −0.4% rate in 2009. Besides imperfect competition, our
framework deviates from the frictionless Modigliani-Miller paradigm by including government deposit insurance and limited liability generating a moral hazard problem for banks,
bankruptcy and equity issuance costs, as well as agency conflicts between the manager and
shareholders. Regulation in this environment can help mitigate bank risk taking.7
The computation of this model is a nontrivial task. In an environment with aggregate
shocks, all equilibrium objects, such as value functions and prices, are a function of the distribution of banks. Interestingly, even if we did not include aggregate shocks, idiosyncratic
shocks to large banks do not wash out in the aggregate. The distribution of banks is an
infinite dimensional object and it is computationally infeasible to include it as a state variable. Thus, we solve the model using an extension of the algorithm proposed by Ifrach and
Weintraub [43] adapted to this environment. This entails approximating the distribution of
banks by a finite number of moments.8

Roadmap

The paper is organized as follows. While we have documented a large number of banking
facts relevant to the current paper in our previous work [23], Section 2 documents a new set of
banking data facts relevant to this paper. Section 3 lays out a simple model environment to
study bank risk taking and loan market competition. Section 4 describes a Markov perfect
equilibrium of that environment. Section 5 discusses how the preference and technology
parameters are chosen and Section 6 provides results for the baseline model. Subsections
6.2 to 6.4 assess the model’s ability to qualitatively match certain untargeted empirical
facts: business cycle moments, the bank lending channel, and the correlation between bank
concentration and fragility. Section 7 conducts our policy counterfactuals and present the
allocative efficiency and welfare results.

Banking Data Facts

In our previous paper [23], we documented the following facts for the U.S. using data from
the Consolidated Report of Condition and Income (known as Call Reports) that insured
banks submit to the Federal Reserve each quarter.9 Entry is procyclical and exit by failure
is countercyclical (correlation with detrended GDP is equal to 0.61 and −0.16, respectively
for the period 1984-2016). Almost all entry and exit by failure is by small banks (defined
as banks in the bottom 99% of the asset distribution). Loans and deposits are procyclical
(correlation with detrended GDP is equal to 0.44 and 0.18, respectively for the same period). As evident from Figure 1, bank concentration has been rising. There is evidence of
imperfect competition: The interest margin is 4.6%; markups exceed 50%; the Lerner Index exceeds 30%; and the Rosse-Panzar H statistic (a measure of the sensitivity of interest
rates to changes in costs) is significantly lower than the perfect competition number of 100%
(specifically, H = 40).10 Loan returns, margins, markups, delinquency rates, and charge-offs
are countercyclical.11
Since we are interested in the effects of capital and liquidity requirements on bank behavior and loan rates, we organize the data in order to understand differences in capital holdings
across banks of different sizes. We refer to the Top 10 banks in the asset distribution as “big”
rium.
9
Balance Sheet and Income Statements items can be found at https://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/. We group
commercial banks to the Bank Holding Company Level.
10
See Section 5 and the Appendix A-3 for a description on how the interest margin, markup, the Lerner
Index and H−statistic are computed as well a description of the data.
11
The countercyclicality of margins and markups is important. Building a model consistent with this is
a novel part of our previous paper Corbae and D’Erasmo [23]. The endogenous mechanism in our papers
works as follows. During a downturn, there is exit by smaller banks. This generates less competition among
existing banks, which raises the interest rate on loans. But since loan demand is inversely related to the
interest rate, the ensuing increase in interest rates (barring government intervention) lowers loan demand
even more, thereby amplifying the downturn. In this way our model provides a novel mechanism - imperfect
loan market competition - to produce endogenous business cycle amplification arising from the banking
sector.

conservation buffer for banks with less than 50 billion in assets (all of these banks included in the “Rest”
group). Banks with more than 50 billion are required to hold additional capital since 2013. Source:
Consolidated Report of Condition and Income.

In all periods, risk-weighted capital ratios are lower for large banking institutions than
those for small banks.13 The fact that capital ratios are above what regulation defines as
well capitalized suggests a buffer stock motive which we model.
While Figure 2 presents the cross-sectional average for big and small banks across time,
the average masks the fact that some banks spend time at the constraint (and even violate
the constraint). Figure 3 plots the histogram of all banks across several years (2000, 2005,
2010 and 2015).

All the banks in the group of Top 10 banks were classified as global systemically important banks
(G-SIBs) as of December of 2016.

Capital ratios based on total assets (as opposed to risk-weighted assets) present a similar pattern.

Note: Tier 1 Capital (rw) refers to Risk-weighted Tier 1 Capital Ratio. Cap. Req. refers to minimum
capital requirement (risk-weighted) plus capital conservation buffer for banks with less than 50 billion in
assets (all of these banks are included in the “Rest” group). Banks with more than 50 billion are required
to hold additional capital since 2013. Source: Consolidated Report of Condition and Income.

The figure makes clear that large institutions have consistently lower levels of capital
than other banks. That is, the capital buffer for large banks is smaller for the Top 10 banks
than for the other banks. Government assistance, private injection of equity and changes in
capital regulation have induced shifts in the distribution of capital. Moreover, during the
crisis, a considerable number of banks failed, merged with other institutions under distress
or received government assistance. The bottom panels of Figure 3 (years 2010 and 2015)
show that it is possible to find banks close or below the minimum required. Many of these
banks end up failing. To analyze the relationship between bank failure and capital ratios,
Figure 4 shows the number banks that are at or below the minimum risk-weighted capital
required and the fraction of those that exit (via failure or merger the corresponding year or
the year after).

exit the industry. The average fraction of banks that exit conditional on being close to the

Environment

Each period, banks intermediate between a unit mass of ex-ante identical entrepreneurs who
have a profitable project which needs to be funded (the potential borrowers) and a mass
N > 1 of identical, households (the potential depositors).

3.1

Households

Infinitely lived, risk neutral households with discount factor β are endowed with 1/N units
of the good each period. We assume households are sufficiently patient such that they
choose to exercise their savings opportunities. In particular, households have access to an
exogenous risk-free storage technology yielding 1+r between any two periods with r ≥ 0 and
β(1 + r) = 1. They can also choose to supply their endowment to a bank or to an individual
9

borrower. If matched with a bank, a household who deposits its endowment there receives rtD
whether the bank succeeds or fails since we assume deposit insurance. Households can hold
a fraction of the portfolio of bank stocks yielding dividends (claims to bank cash flows) and
can inject equity to banks. They pay lump-sum taxes/transfers τt which include a lump-sum
tax τtD used to cover deposit insurance for failing banks, and a tax (transfer if negative) for
government sales and service of securities τtA . Finally, if a household was to match directly
with an entrepreneur (i.e. directly fund an entrepreneur’s project), it must compete with
bank loans. Hence, the household could not expect to receive more than the bank lending
rate rL in successful states and must pay a monitoring cost. Since households can purchase
claims to bank cash flows, and banks can more efficiently minimize costly monitoring along
the lines of Diamond [27], there is no benefit to matching directly with entrepreneurs.

3.2

Entrepreneurs

Infinitely lived, risk neutral entrepreneurs demand bank loans in order to fund a new project
each period. Specifically, a project requires one unit of investment in period t and returns
next period:

1 + zt+1 Rt with prob p(Rt , zt+1 )
(1)
1−λ
with prob [1 − p(Rt , zt+1 )]
in the successful and unsuccessful states, respectively. That is, borrower gross returns are
given by 1 + zt+1 Rt in the successful state and by 1 − λ in the unsuccessful state. The
success of a borrower’s project, which occurs with probability p(Rt , zt+1 ), is independent
across borrowers and time conditional on the borrower’s choice of technology Rt ≥ 0 and an
aggregate technology shock at the beginning of the following period denoted zt+1 (i.e. there
is one period time-to-build). The aggregate technology shock zt ∈ Z evolves as a Markov
process F (z 0 , z) = prob(zt+1 = z 0 |zt = z).
The entrepreneur can save aE,t+1 ∈ R+ with return r (that is also accessible to households)
and can choose whether to retain earnings It+1 ∈ [0, 1] in order to finance investment.
We assume that the entrepreneur is sufficiently impatient that she would not choose to
undertake any of these alternatives. That is, the discount factor βE is sufficiently low such
that entrepreneurs choose not to use retained earnings to finance their projects, instead
choosing to eat their earnings and fund projects which generate returns in the following
period using one period loans that require monitoring.
When the borrower makes her choice of technology Rt , the aggregate shock zt+1 has
not been realized. As for the likelihood of success or failure, a borrower who chooses to
run a project with higher returns has more risk of failure and there is less failure in good
times. Specifically, p(Rt , zt+1 ) is assumed to be decreasing in Rt and increasing in zt+1 .
Thus, the technology exhibits a risk-return trade-off. While borrowers are ex-ante identical,
they are ex-post heterogeneous owing to the realizations of the shocks to the return on their
project. We envision borrowers either as firms choosing a technology that might not succeed
or households choosing a house that might appreciate or depreciate.
There is limited liability on the part of the borrower. If rtL is the interest rate on a bank
loan that the borrower faces, the borrower receives max{zt+1 Rt − rtL , 0} in the successful
10

state and 0 in the failure state. Specifically, in the unsuccessful state he receives 1 − λ which
must be relinquished to the lender. Table 1 summarizes the risk-return tradeoff that the
borrower faces if the cross-sectional distribution of banks is µt and the aggregate state is zt .

Borrowers have an outside option (reservation utility) ωt ∈ [ω, ω] drawn at the beginning
of the period from distribution function Ω(ωt ). These draws are i.i.d. over time. We think
of this outside option as an alternative source of external finance to the bank loan.
Both Rt and ωt are private information to the entrepreneur, as well as the history of past
borrowing and repayment by the entrepreneur (which provides the rationale for short term
bank loans). As in Bernanke and Gertler [13], success or failure is also private information
to the entrepreneur unless the loan is monitored by the lender. With one period loans, since
reporting failure (and hence repayment of 1 − λ < 1 + rtL ) is a dominant strategy in the
absence of monitoring, loans must be monitored. Monitoring is costly as in Diamond [27].

3.3

Banks

As in Diamond [27], banks exist in our environment to pool risk and economize on monitoring
costs. We assume there are two types of banks: θ ∈ {b, f } for big and small - what we call
“fringe” - banks, respectively. Unlike our earlier paper (Corbae and D’Erasmo [23]) where
there are multiple big banks, to keep the analysis simple, we assume there is a representative
big bank if it is active (as in Gowrisankaran and Holmes [39]). If active, the big bank is
a Stackelberg leader in the loan market, each period choosing a level of loans before fringe
banks make their choice of loan supply. Consistent with a Cournot framework, the dominant
bank understands that its choice of loan supply will influence the interest rate on loans given
the best response of fringe banks. A fringe bank takes the interest rate as given when
choosing its loan supply.
At the beginning of each period t after the realization of the aggregate shock zt , the
i
net cash flows (denoted πθ,t
) for bank i of type θ are realized from its previous lending
i
(denoted `θ,t ), liquid assets (cash and securities, denoted Aiθ,t ), and deposits (denoted diθ,t )
augment existing equity to give beginning of period equity (or net worth) niθ,t . At that point,
a bank can choose to exit. If the bank chooses not to exit, the incumbent is randomly
matched with a set of potential household depositors δθ,t . An incumbent bank then chooses
a quantity diθ,t+1 of deposits to accept up to the capacity constraint δθ,t (i.e., diθ,t+1 ≤ δθ,t

11

D,i
where δθ,t ∈ {δθ1 , . . . , δθn } ⊆ R+ ) at interest rate rθ,t
that it offers each potential depositor.14
The capacity constraint evolves according to an exogenously given Markov process given
by Gθ (δθ,t+1 , δθ,t ) with realizations which are i.i.d across banks. The value of δθ,t for a new
entrant is drawn from the probability distribution Geθ (δθ,t ). Differences in the volatility of
funding inflows we find in the data between big and small banks provide a reason why banks
of different sizes hold different size capital buffers. Since the household can always store at
D,i
rate r, we know rθ,t
≥ r.
Along with possible seasoned equity injections (denoted eiθ,t ∈ R+ ), an incumbent bank
i
∈
allocates its net worth and deposits to its asset portfolio and pays dividends (denoted Dθ,t
A
R+ ). We assume liquid assets (e.g. U.S. treasuries) have a return equal to rt , which the
government takes as given. The incumbent bank’s portfolio and dividend policy must satisfy
the following constraint

i
niθ,t + eiθ,t + diθ,t+1 ≥ `iθ,t+1 + Aiθ,t+1 + Dθ,t
+ ζθ (eiθ,t , zt ) + κiθ + ciθ `iθ,t+1
(2)

where ζθ (eiθ,t , zt ) denotes aggregate state dependent equity issuance costs and [κiθ +ciθ `iθ,t+1 ]
represents non-interest expenses (including monitoring costs which are a function of loans
issued). We assume that ζθ (0, zt ) = 0 and ζθ (eiθ,t , zt ) is an increasing function of eiθ,t and
decreasing in zt (i.e. external financing costs are increasing in the amount of equity issued
i
and less costly in good times).15 Since the bank’s objective is increasing in dividends Dθ,t
,
(2) will hold as an equality constraint.
In Corbae and D’Erasmo [23], we document differences in bank cost structure across
size. We assume that banks pay non-interest expenses on their loans (as in the delegated
monitoring
 model of Diamond [27]) that differ across banks ofi different sizes, which we denote
i
i
cθ `θ,t+1 . Further, as in the data we assume a fixed cost κθ .
i
Let πθ,t+1
denote the net cash flow of bank i of type θ after the realization of the next
period’s aggregate shock associated with its current lending and borrowing decisions given
by
n

i
L
πθ,t+1 = p(Rt , zt+1 )rt − (1 − p(Rt , zt+1 ))λ `iθ,t+1 + rtA Aiθ,t+1 − rtD diθ,t+1 .
(3)

The first two terms represent the gross return the bank receives from successful and unsuccessful loan projects, respectively, the third term represents returns on securities, and the
fourth represents interest expenses (payments on deposits).
Beginning-of-next-period equity (or net worth) is then given by
i
− diθ,t+1
niθ,t+1 = `iθ,t+1 + Aiθ,t+1 + πθ,t+1

(4a)

where the second inequality follows from (2) with equality. Equation (4a) is the bank balance
sheet identity where equity and deposits equal loans, securities and bank net cash. The law
14

Anticipating a “recursive” formulation of the bank decision problem, certain state variables chosen in
period t but paying off in period t + 1 will be denoted yt+1 (e.g. deposits dt+1 ).
15
This “reduced form” approach to modeling equity issuance is similar to Cooley and Quadrini [22], Gomes
[38], and Hennesy and Whited [41].

12

of motion for net worth in (4b) makes clear that retained earnings augment net worth and
dividend payouts lower net worth.
Using the definition of equity in (4a), when making loan, securities, and deposit decisions,
bank i of type θ faces a constraint that they expect to have sufficient equity at the beginning
of next period to meet its risk weighted capital requirement:
Et [niθ,t+1 ] =

where ϕθ,t is the capital requirement and wθ,t

are risk weights associated with loans and
A

`
, liquid assets
> wθ,t
= 1. Given wθ,t
liquid assets, respectively. We will typically take wθ,t
help relax the capital requirement constraint, but may also lower bank profitability and
solvency. This creates room for a precautionary motive for liquid assets and the possibility
that banks hold capital equity above the level required by the regulatory authority.
Another policy proposal is associated with bank liquidity requirements. Basel III [7]
proposed that the liquidity coverage ratio, which is the stock of high-quality liquid assets
(which include government securities) divided by total net cash outflows over the next 30
calendar days, should exceed 100% under a stress scenario. In the context of a model period
being one year, this would amount to a critical value of 1/12 or roughly 8%. This is also
close to the figure for reserve requirements that is bank-size dependent, anywhere from zero
to 10%. For the model, we implement a liquidity requirement as:
i
%θ,t diθ,t+1 ≤ Aiθ,t+1 + πθ,t+1
(zC ),

(6)

where %θ,t denotes the (possibly) size and state dependent liquidity requirement and cash
i
πθ,t+1
(zC ) is evaluated in a stress scenario.16
There is limited liability on the part of banks. This imposes a lower bound equal to zero
in the event the bank exits. In the context of our model, limited liability implies that, upon
exit, shareholders get:
(
)
max niθ,t+1 − ξ`iθ,t+1 , 0 ,

(7)

where ξ ∈ [0, 1] measures liquidation costs of an insolvent loan portfolio in the event of exit.
The objective function of the bank is to maximize the expected present discounted value
of future dividends net of equity injections using the manager’s discount factor which can
depart from the households’ discount factor β by the factor γ ∈ (0, 1]:

We introduce the possibility of agency problems through managerial myopia when γ < 1
along the lines of Acharya and Thakor [1].17 Since asset markets are incomplete and banks
16

Notice that an increase in Aiθ,t+1 and decrease in diθ,t+1 help to satisfy both the risk weighted capital
requirement in (5) and the liquidity coverage ratio in (6).
17
There are many papers on managerial myopia providing a foundation for such behavior. See for instance,
Stein [61] who provides a signalling argument or Minnick and Rosenthal [53] who provide a compensation
argument.

13

face a minimum capital requirement constraint together with equity issuance costs (which
in place derive in a concave value function), in order to obtain a well defined distribution
of banks, we need a condition that guarantees that γβ(1 + rtA ) < 1, a standard assumption
in models with incomplete markets. Since we assumed β(1 + r) = 1 to keep the household
1+r
decision problem bounded, we assume 1+r
A > γ which assures a bounded distribution over
bank net worth.
Entry costs for the creation of banks are denoted by Υb ≥ Υf ≥ 0. Every period a large
number of potential entrants make the decision of whether or not to enter the market after
the realization of zt and incumbent exit but before the realization of δt shocks. Entry costs
correspond to the initial injection of equity into the bank subject to equity finance costs
ζθ (Υθ + nie,θ,t , zt ) where nie,θ,t is the entrant’s initial equity injection.

3.4

Information

There is asymmetric information on the part of borrowers and lenders (banks and households). Only borrowers know the riskiness of the project they choose (Rt ) and their outside
option (ωt ). Project success or failure is unobservable unless the project is monitored. All
other information is observable.

3.5

Timing

At the beginning of period t,
1. Aggregate shock zt is realized which induces niθ,t for incumbent banks and project
returns for entrepreneurs.
2. Incumbents decide whether to exit and potential entrants decide whether to enter
which requires an initial equity injection in stage 3.
3. Funding shocks δt - the mass of potential depositors the bank is matched with - are
realized and borrowers draw ωt .
• The dominant bank chooses how many loans to extend, how many deposits to
accept given depositors’ choices, how many assets to hold, how many dividends
i
to pay, and equity injections (`ib,t+1 , dib,t+1 , Aib,t+1 , Db,t
, eib,t ).
• Each fringe bank observes the total loan supply of the dominant bank (`ib,t+1 ) and
all other fringe banks (that jointly determine the loan interest rate rtL ) and simultaneously decide how many loans to extend, how many deposits to accept,
how many assets to hold, how many dividends to pay, and equity injections
i
(`if,t+1 , dif,t+1 , Aif,t+1 , Df,t
, eif,t ).
• Borrowers choose whether or not to undertake a project requiring bank funding
and, if so, a level of technology Rt .
• Households pay taxes/transfers τt = τtD + τtA to fund deposit insurance (τtD ) and
service government securities (τtA ), choose to store or deposit at a bank, how many
stocks to hold, equity injections, and consume.

Industry Equilibrium

This section presents the equilibrium of the model. We start by describing the household
problem (which determines the supply of deposits and seasoned equity to banks) and the
entrepreneur problem (which determines the demand for bank loans) followed by the bank
problem.

(11)

We will derive the expression for the equilibrium price of a share after we present the bank’s
problem.
If banks offer the same interest rates on deposits as households can receive from their
D
storage opportunity (i.e. rt+1
= r), then a household would be indifferent between matching
with a bank and using the autarkic storage technology. In that case, any household who is
matched with a bank would be willing to deposit at the insured bank. Furthermore, the first
order condition for saving in the form of deposits or storage technology implies β(1 + r) = 1,
which we assume parametrically.

4.2

Entrepreneur’s Problem

Every period, given {rtL , zt , ωt }, entrepreneurs choose whether (ιE,t = 1) or not (ιE,t = 0) to
operate the technology (ιE,t ∈ {0, 1}) and if they do, they choose the type of technology to
operate Rt , whether to use retained earnings It+1 ∈ [0, 1] to internally finance the project,
15

how much to save aE,t+1 ∈ R+ to maximize the expected discounted utility of consumption.
Therefore,

(13)

where

πE (It , Rt , zt+1 ) =

max{0, −λ − rL + (1 + rL )It }
with prob 1 − p(Rt , zt+1 )

where CE,t ∈ R+ is the entrepreneur’s consumption.
If mt is the multiplier on the non-negativity constraint on aE,t+1 ≥ 0, the first order
condition for aE,t+1 is given by
mt = 1 − βE (1 + r).
(14)
Since we assume a sufficiently impatient entrepreneur (i.e. βE (1 + r) < 1), then aE,t+1 = 0.
Similarly, the entrepreneur chooses not to use retained earnings to fund the project (i.e.
It+1 = 0 provided βE (1 + rtL ) < 1 (i.e. the bank loan is not too costly relative to current
consumption).
If the entrepreneur undertakes the project, then an application of the envelope theorem
implies
∂Ezt+1 |zt πE (It , Rt , zt+1 )
= −Ezt+1 |zt [p(Rt , zt+1 )] < 0.
(15)
∂rtL
Thus, participating borrowers are worse off the higher is the interest rates on loans. This
has implications for the demand for loans determined by the participation constraint. In
particular, since the demand for loans is given by
Z ω
d L
L (rt , zt ) =
1{ωt ≤Ezt+1 |zt πE (0,Rt ,zt+1 )} dΩ(ωt ),
(16)
0

where 1{·} is an indicator function that takes the value one if the argument {·} is true and
∂Ld (rtL ,zt )
zero otherwise. In that case, (15) implies
< 0. That is, the loan demand curve is
∂rtL
downward sloping.

4.3

Incumbent Bank Problem

We will study equilibria which do not depend on the name i of the bank, only relevant state
variables. Since we will use recursive methods to solve a bank’s decision problem, let any
variable yθ,t be denoted yθ and yθ,t+1 be denoted yθ0 . Further, we denote the cross-sectional
distribution of banks or “industry state” by
µ = {µb (n, δ), µf (n, δ)},
16

(17)

where each element of µ is a measure µθ (n, δ) corresponding to active banks of type θ over
matched deposits δ and net worth n at stage 3 in period t of our timing.18 The law of motion

0
} denotes the
, Me,f
for the industry state is denoted µ0 = H(z, µ, z 0 , Me0 ) where Me0 = {Me,b
vector of entrants of each type and the transition function H is defined explicitly below.
After being matched with δθ potential depositors and making them a take-it-or-leave-it
deposit rate offer rθD , an incumbent bank of type θ chooses loans `0θ , deposits d0θ , and asset
holdings A0θ in order to maximize expected discounted dividends net of equity injections.
Following the realization of z, banks can choose to exit setting xθ = 1 or choose to remain
xθ = 0. Given the take-it-or-leave-it deposit rate offer and that the outside storage option
for a household is r, we know in equilibrium rθD = r.
Given the Stackelberg assumption, the big bank takes into account that its loan supply
affects the loan interest rate and that fringe banks will best respond to its loan supply.

banks move after the big bank.
The value of an incumbent bank in period t (at stage 3) consistent with the manager’s
choice over {{`0θ , A0θ , Dθ , eθ } ≥ 0, d0θ ∈ [0, δθ ], x0θ ∈ {0, 1}} is given by

where the value function in (20) is defined over individual states {nθ , δθ }, aggregate states
{z, µ}, and ι which is empty if θ = b and is `0b if θ = f . This latter variable takes into account
that fringe banks take as given the loan supply decision by the big bank in this Stackelberg
game (not only on the equilibrium path but any arbitrary value of `0b ). Since ι = ∅ for big
banks, the continuation value on-the-equilibrium path Vb (nθ , δθ ; z, µ) = Vb (nθ , δθ ; z, µ, ∅). In
the case of fringe banks, the continuation value is
Vf (nf , δf ; z, µ) = Vf (nf , δf ; z, µ, `0b (nb , δb ; z, µ))
(i.e. the value consistent with the equilibrium loan decision of the big bank `0b (nb , δb ; z, µ)).
These continuation values capture how changes in `0b affect the full equilibrium path.19 Equations (21) to (24) are the bank’s budget constraint, balance sheet constraint, capital requirement constraint, and liquidity coverage ratio constraint, respectively. Equation (25) is the
market-clearing condition which is included since the dominant bank must take into account
its impact on prices. For any given µ, Lf (z, µ, `0b ) can be thought of as a “reaction function”
of fringe banks to the loan supply decision of the dominant bank. Changes in `0b affect the
equilibrium interest rate through its direct effect on the aggregate loan supply (first term)
but also through the effect on the loan supply of fringe banks (second term). Equation (26)
corresponds to the evolution of the aggregate state to be defined below. The liquidation
value of the bank for a given n0θ and `0θ is
Vθx (n0θ , `0θ ) = max {0, n0θ − ξθ `0θ } .

(27)

The lower bound on the exit value in (27) is associated with limited liability.
The solution to this problem provides value functions as well as bank decision rules, that
when evaluated at ι on-the-equilibrium-path (i.e., for fringe banks at ι = `0b (nb , δb ; z, µ)), can
be written as `0θ (nθ , δθ ; z, µ), A0θ (nθ , δθ ; z, µ), Dθ (nθ , δθ ; z, µ), eθ (nθ , δθ ; z, µ), d0θ (nθ , δθ ; z, µ),
and x0θ (nθ , δθ ; z, µ, z 0 ).
Now that we have presented the problem of an incumbent bank, we can show how the
price of a bank’s shares and the value of a bank are related. After normalizing the number
19

More specifically, the recursive formulation captures all possible deviations and its effects on the full
equilibrium-path and not only contemporaneous deviations. As the big bank evaluates different values of `0b
it takes into account that this results in contemporaneous changes in the interest rate on loans that feeds
directly into the loan and asset decisions of fringe banks, but also into the evolution of the industry (via
profitability and entry/exit) that will possibly induce further changes in its loan supply.

18

of shares of each bank to 1, the price of a share of a non-exiting bank of type θ in state
(nθ , δθ ; z, µ, ι) after dividends have been paid and equity injected is defined by
Pθ (nθ , δθ ; z, µ, ι) ≡ Vθ∗ (nθ , δθ ; z, µ, ι) − (Dθ (nθ , δθ ; z, µ, ι) − eθ (nθ , δθ ; z, µ, ι)).

(28)

where Vθ∗ (nθ , δθ ; z, µ, ι) denotes the value of the expected discounted stream of net cash-flows
using the household discount factor. Thus, substituting (28) into the household’s first order
condition for its stock choice in equation (11) yields
Pθ (nθ , δθ ; z, µ, ι) = βEz0 ,δ0 |z,δ [Dθ (n0θ , δθ0 ; z 0 , µ0 , ι0 ) − eθ (n0θ , δθ0 ; z 0 , µ0 , ι0 ) + Pθ0 (n0θ , δθ0 ; z 0 , µ0 , ι0 )] ⇐⇒
Vθ∗ (nθ , δθ ; z, µ, ι) − (Dθ (nθ , δθ ; z, µ, ι) − eθ (nθ , δθ ; z, µ, ι)) = βEz0 ,δ0 |z,δ [Vθ∗ (n0θ , δθ0 ; z 0 , µ0 , ι0 )] .(29)
But (29) can be re-arranged to be identical to the value of a continuing bank defined in (20)
when managers’ and households’ preferences are aligned (i.e. when γ = 1) while Vθ (·) ≤ Vθ∗ (·)
otherwise.

4.4

Bank Entry

Next we turn to the value of entry. Both the industry state µ and the incumbent value
function above in (20) are defined for stage 3 in period t of our timing. However, the entry
decision is at stage 2 after exit but before the current mass of entrants Me,θ is known (so
that µ is not yet fully defined at that stage). Hence, we will define the entry value function
in terms of stage 2 of period t + 1. In particular, the value of entry net of entry costs for
0
banks of type θ in stage 2 of period t + 1 in aggregate state z 0 if there were Me,θ
entrants at
stage 2 of period t + 1 is then given by

Funding Deposit Insurance and Servicing Securities

In this section, we continue to use the same timing convention used in the previous section.
The government collects lump-sum taxes (or pays transfers if negative) denoted τ that cover
the cost of deposit insurance τ D and the net proceeds of issuing securities τ A .
Across all states (z, µ, z 0 ), τ D must cover deposit insurance in the event of bank failure.
Let post-liquidation net transfers be given by
n
o
∆0θ (nθ , δθ , z, µ, z 0 ) = (1 + rD )d0θ − p(R, z 0 )(1 + rL ) + (1 − p(R, z 0 ))(1 − λ) − ξθ `0θ − (1 + rA )A0θ
where ξ ≤ 1 is the post-liquidation value of the bank’s loan portfolio. Then aggregate taxes
are given by
"
#

Then, assuming that the government supplies all the securities that the banking sector
demands at price rA (i.e. the supply of domestic securities is perfectly elastic), the tax
(transfers if negative) necessary to cover the net proceeds of issuing government securities is
given by
0

τ A (z, µ, z 0 ) · N = A0 (1 + rA ) − A00 (z 0 , µ0 (z, µ, z 0 , Me0 (z, µ, z 0 ))).

(34)

As a result, the per-capita taxes are

Calibration

In order to avoid having a low probability event like the financial crisis play a disproportionate
role in our analysis, our calibration strategy is to estimate model parameters using annual
data from 1984 to 2007. To account for the possibility of a financial crisis, we add a crisis
state to our shock process that is consistent with data from 1984 to 2016. Thus, banks
in our model make decisions recognizing a crisis may occur. To accomplish this strategy,
we simulate panels of 24 model periods and drop those panels which include a crisis when
estimating the parameters. Having explained the strategy, we now go into further detail.
We use several data sources to calibrate the model. A model period is one year. Our
main source for bank level variables (and aggregates derived from it) is the Consolidated
Report of Condition and Income for Commercial Banks (regularly called “call reports”).20
We aggregate commercial bank level information to the Bank Holding Company Level. We
also use the TFP series for the U.S. Business Sector, produced by John Fernald [35] and
data provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to identify bank failures and
losses in the event of failure. Our calibration strategy involves setting a set of parameters
directly from the data and a second set using Simulated Method of Moments (SMM).
We begin with the parameterization of the four stochastic processes: F (z 0 , z), Gθ (δ 0 , δ),
p(R, z 0 ), and Ω(ω). To calibrate the stochastic process for aggregate technology shocks

F (z 0 , z), we detrend the sequence of TFP using the H-P filter and estimate the following
equation:
log(zt ) = ρz log(zt−1 ) + uzt ,
+ with ut ∼ N (0, σuz ). Once parameters ρz and σuz are estimated, we discretize the process
using the Tauchen [62] method. We set the number of grid points to four, that is zt ∈ Z =
{zC , zB , zM , zG } (for “crisis”, “bad”, “median”, “good”). We choose the grid in order to
capture the infrequent crisis states we observe in the data. In particular, we choose zM to
match the mean of the process normalized to 1 (i.e. zM = 1), select zB (“bad times”) and
zG (“good times”) so they are at 1.5 standard deviations from zM and set the value of zC
(“crisis” state) to be at 2.75 standard deviations below the mean to be consistent with the
observed TFP levels during the 1982 recession and the last financial crisis (years 2008/2009).
As discussed above, moments from the call report data are computed beginning in 1984
(due to an overhaul of the data in that year) and end in 2007 (due to the unconventional
government intervention since 2008 which is not part of our model). When performing the
estimation exercise, moments from the model are computed using samples of 24 years that
do not include observations with the crisis state z = z1 .21
We identify “big” banks with the top 10 banks (when sorted by assets) and the fringe
banks with the rest.22 As in Pakes and McGuire [56] we restrict the number of big banks by
setting the entry cost to a prohibitively high number if the number of incumbents after entry
and exit exceeds a given number. In our application, there will be at most one representative
big bank and a continuum of potential fringe entrant banks.
The solution to our problem implies that the deposit capacity constraint binds in all
states (since rA > r), so we can approximate the constraint using information on deposits
from our panel of commercial banks in the U.S. In particular, after controlling for firm and
year fixed effects as well as a time trend, we estimate the following autoregressive process
for log-deposits for bank i of type θ in period t:
i
i
log(δθ,t
) = (1 − ρdθ )kθ0 + ρdθ log(δθ,t−1
) + uiθ,t ,

(36)

i
where δθ,t
is the sum of deposits and other borrowings in period t for bank i, and uiθ,t is
2
iid and distributed N (0, σθ,u
).23 Since this is a dynamic model we use the method proposed
by Arellano and Bond [6]. To keep the state space workable, we again apply the method
proposed by Tauchen [62] to obtain a finite state Markov representation Gθ (δ 0 , δ) to the
autoregressive process in (36). To apply Tauchen’s method, we use the estimated values of
ρdb = 0.41 and ρdf = 0.88, and σb,u = 0.11 and σf,u = 0.15 from (36). Since we work with a
normalization in the model (i.e., z3 = 1), the mean kθ0 in (36) is not directly relevant. Instead,
we include the mean of the finite state Markov process, denoted µdθ , as one of the parameters
21

All averages from the call report
correspond to asset-weighted averages. That is, the average of
PNt data
variable x in year t equals x̂ = i=1
wti xit where wti is the ratio of assets of bank i in year t to total assets
in year t and xit is the observation of variable x for bank i in year t.
22
The group of Top 10 banks contains all the U.S. banks that were classified as global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) as of December of 2016.

One could enrich this specification to include a jump process which would be a reduced form way to

consistent with big banks having a geographically diversified pool of funding (see Liang and
Rhoades [49] and Aguirregabiria et. al [2]), big banks have less volatile funding inflows, which
is one important factor explaining why they hold a smaller capital buffer in our model.
We parameterize the stochastic process for the borrower’s project as follows. For each
borrower, let s = αz 0 − bRψ + εe , where εe is iid (across agents and time) and drawn from
N (0, σε2 ). We define success to be the event that s > 0, so in states with higher z or higher
εe success is more likely. Then
p(R, z 0 ) = 1 − Pr(s ≤ 0|R, z 0 )

This value is consistent with a fraction of entrepreneurs in the total population ( 1+N
to 17% that corresponds to the value reported in Quadrini [57].
We estimate the marginal cost of producing a loan cθ (`0θ ) and the fixed cost κθ following
the empirical literature on banking (see, for example, Berger et. al. [12]).24 The marginal
cost is derived from an estimate of marginal net expenses that is defined to be marginal
non-interest expenses net of marginal non-interest income. Marginal non-interest expenses
are derived from the following trans-log cost function:
log(N IEti ) = g1 log(wti ) + h1 log(`iθ,t ) + g2 log(qti ) + g3 log(wti )2

`it corresponds to real loans (one of the two bank i’s outputs), qti represents safe securities
(the second bank output), the t regressor refers to a time trend, and k8,t refers to time fixed
effects. We estimate this equation by panel fixed effects with robust standard errors clustered
by bank.25 Non-interest marginal expenses are then computed as:

The marginal cost estimated is also used to compute our measure of Markups and the Lerner Index.
We eliminate bank-year observations in which the bank organization is involved in a merger or the bank
is flagged as being an entrant or a failing bank. We only use banks with three or more observations in the
sample.

The estimated (asset-weighted) average of marginal non-interest expenses is reported in the
second column of Table 2. Marginal non-interest income (Mg Non-Int Inc.) is estimated
using an equation similar to equation (38) (without input prices) where the left hand side
corresponds to total non-interest income. The estimated (asset-weighted) average of marginal
non-interest income is reported in the first column of Table 2. Net marginal expenses (Mg Net
Exp.) are computed as the difference between marginal non-interest expenses and marginal
non-interest income. The estimated (asset-weighted) average of net marginal non-interest
expenses is reported in the third column of Table 2. The fixed cost κθ is estimated as the
total cost on expenses of premises and fixed assets. The estimated (asset-weighted) average
fixed cost (scaled by loans) is reported in the fourth column of Table 2.
The final column of Table 2 presents our estimate of average costs for big and small banks.
We find a statistically significant lower average cost for big banks than small banks. This
is consistent with increasing returns as in the delegated monitoring model of Diamond [27]
and with empirical evidence on increasing returns as in, among others, Berger and Mester
[15].

Mg Net Exp. corresponds to net marginal expense and it is calculated as marginal non-interest

We parameterize the cost function in the model as
cθ (`0θ ) = cθ,0 `0θ + cθ,1 (`0θ )2 .

(40)

We incorporate the estimated average marginal net expenses to our SMM procedure to help
pin down the parameters of this function. We also use the estimates of the fourth column
of Table 2 to pin down the fixed operating costs in the model.
To calibrate rD = r̄ we target the average cost of funds computed as the ratio of interest
expense on deposits and federal funds purchased over total deposits plus federal funds purchased.26 Similarly, we calibrate rA to the ratio of interest income from safe securities over
the total safe securities (net of marginal not interest expenses on securities). The parameter
λ is set to 0.406 to be consistent with the average charge-off rate that equals 0.7457% in

The nominal interest rate is converted to a real interest rate by using CPI inflation (we use the realized
inflation rate as a measure of expected inflation).

24

the data at the observed default frequency of 1.835%. The liquidation value of the loan
portfolio (1 − ξθ ) is estimated using data from the FDIC. We set ξb = ξf = 0.1965. The
equity issuance cost function is parameterized as follows: ζθ (e, z) = (ζθ,0 e + ζθ,1 e2 )( zz4 )ζz .
The quadratic form for equity issuance is relatively standard in the corporate finance literature (e.g. Henessy and Whited [41]) and the term ( zz4 ) captures, in a parsimonious way,
changes in the cost of external finance along the business cycle (consistent with the evidence
presented in McLean and Zhao [51] and the “financial accelerator” literature pioneered in
Bernanke and Gertler [13]). We estimate the parameters of this function by allowing equity
issuance costs to depend explicitly on bank type. As our estimates show below there are
significant differences between equity issuance costs for big and small banks (much in line
with the evidence described in Hughes, Mester, and Moon [42]).
In our benchmark parameterization, we use values associated with regulation in place
before Basel III and the recent financial crisis. Thus we set the minimum level of the bank
equity risk-weighted capital ratio for both types of banks to 4%. That is, ϕb,z = ϕf,z = 0.04
A
for all z and wθ,z
= 0 for all θ and z.
Since we do not observe failure or entry by big banks during the calibration period (19842007), identification of Υb is challenging for identification. We set the value of Υb to be the
maximum value such that if there were to exist big bank failure, a big bank would replace
the failed bank immediately. The entry cost is kept constant for all our counterfactuals.
This leaves us with 20 parameters to estimate via simulated method of moments (SMM):
{α, b, σε , ψ, ω, γ, µdb , µdf , cb,0 , cb,1 , cf,0 , cf,1 , κb , κf , ζb,0 , ζb,1 , ζf,0 , ζf,1 , ζz , Υf }.
To pin down these parameters, except for two data moments, we use the data for commercial
banks described in Section 2 and in our companion paper. One of the extra moments is the
average real equity return (12.94%) as reported by Diebold and Yilmaz [30], added to help
identify parameters associated with the borrower’s return pz 0 R∗ . The other moment is the
elasticity of loan demand (-1.10) as estimated by Bassett, et. al. [8].
The set of targets from commercial bank data includes the loan interest margin (4.69%)
that is defined as the difference between the interest income from loans minus the cost of
deposits, the standard deviation of the interest margin (0.339%), the loan default frequency
(1.835%), marginal net expenses and fixed cost by bank size (as reported in Table 2), equity
issuance over assets by bank size (0.02% and 0.11% for big and fringe banks, respectively),
and the frequency of equity issuance (9.86% and 9.59%), the bank failure and entry rate
(1.02% and 1.35%, respectively), the dividend to asset ratio by bank size (0.62% and 0.66%
for big and fringe banks, respectively), and the frequency of dividend payments (96.11% and
85.38% for big and fringe banks, respectively).
While the balance sheet in our model is fairly rich and considers the most important
pieces of its empirical counterpart such as loans, cash and securities, deposits and equity, in
order to connect the model’s balance sheet with the one in the data that contains several
additional items, we proceed as follows. We identify loans in the model with the reported
value for risk-weighted assets. Since there are two assets in the model, loans (risky assets)
and cash and securities (safe assets), once we determine the ratio of risk-weighted assets to
total assets (loans to assets in the model) by bank size, the ratio of cash and securities can
25

be obtained as a residual. One of the main counterfactuals in the paper evaluates changes
in capital regulation, so we target the risk-weighted Tier 1 capital ratio by bank size (equity
to loans in the model). The risk-weighted capital ratio together with risk-weighted assets to
total asset ratio imply the equity to asset ratio and the ratio of deposits to total assets in
the model. Effectively, the deposits to asset ratio in the model is equivalent to the ratio of
deposits plus other borrowings and other liabilities to assets in the data. Table 3 presents
the balance sheet of the banks in the data mapped to variables in the model.

We include as targets the loans to assets ratio and the capital ratio (risk-weighted).
We also use as targets the ratio of deposits to total output (56.20%) as well as measures of
concentration such as the deposit market share of fringe banks (60.99%) and the loan market
share of fringe banks (61.87%). While we do not use them as targets, we provide information
on how the model behaves in terms of loan returns (4.53%), markup and the Lerner index.
The markup is derived using the cost estimates presented above. In particular, the markup
is defined as
p
M arkup = − 1
c
where p denotes a measure of price and c a measure of marginal cost. We estimate p as the
ratio of interest income from loans and c as the ratio of interest expenses from deposits and
fed funds over deposits and fed funds plus marginal net non-interest expenses (as reported
in column 3 of Table 2). Similarly, the Lerner index is computed as Lerner = 1 − pc . The
average markup is 70.75% and the average Lerner is 38.48%,

The computation of the model is a nontrivial task. We solve the model using an extension
of the algorithm proposed by Ifrach and Weintraub [43] adapted to this environment. This
entails approximating the distribution of banks by a finite number of moments.27 In short,
the solution entails keeping track of all the states of dominant players (i.e., the big bank),
the exogenous aggregate variables and approximating the evolution of the distribution of
fringe banks using a set of moments. The state spaceR of the big bank is {nb , δb , z, N , M}
where
N denotes the average value of nf + δf (i.e., (nf + δf )dµ(nf , δf )/M) and M =
R
dµ(nf , δf ) is the mass of incumbent fringe banks. The state space of any fringe bank is
{nf , δf , nb , δb , z, N , M}.
Tables 4.a and 4.b show the calibrated parameters, corresponding to those chosen outside
and inside the model, respectively.

Table 5 provides the moments generated by the model for the above parameter values
relative to the data. This table shows that the model does a relatively good job at matching
the targeted moments. At the calibrated parameters, both the big bank and fringe banks
display a positive capital buffer (larger for fringe banks). The model also captures correctly
the fraction of the deposit market serviced by fringe banks (i.e., the level of concentration
in the model is consistent with the data). The model is also in line with the data when it
comes to the net interest margin, the default frequency, the borrower return, the balance
sheet ratios, and the ratio of equity issuance to assets as well as the ratio of dividends to
assets. As a fraction of assets, fringe banks issue more equity than the big bank (like in
data), even though, like in Hughes and Mester [42], equity issuance costs are significantly
higher for fringe banks than that of the big bank. The model over-predicts bank entry and
failure rates and under-predicts the elasticity of loan demand and the marginal cost for big
banks.

Table 6 provides additional nontargeted moments from the model. Table 6 shows that the
model captures relatively well all of the moments in the balance sheets of banks of different
sizes. Note that the securities to asset ratio is implied by the loan to asset ratio (since loans
and securities are the only two assets in the model). Similarly, the deposit to asset ratio
and the equity to asset ratio are implied by the loan to asset ratio and the risk-weighted
capital ratio (effectively equal to equity to loans in the model). The model under-predicts
the frequency of dividend payments (mostly for fringe banks) and the frequency of equity
issuance for big banks (even though costs are substantially low). As we described in Table
5 the model under-predicts the marginal cost for big banks and that results in a level of
Markup and Lerner Index higher than in the data in Table 6. However, the loan return and
the loan market share in the model are almost perfectly aligned with the values observed in
the data.

Results

For the parameter values in Tables 4.a and 4.b, we find an equilibrium where, for example
when aggregate variables are evaluated at their observed mean, exit occurs along the equilibrium path by fringe banks: (i) with the lowest deposit holdings (δL = 0.0325, which is 52%
lower than the deposits of an average fringe bank) and low net worth levels (n ≤ 0.004, that is
an equity level lower than 6.5% of average loans), and (ii) with up to average deposit holdings
(δ ≤ δM = 0.0621) but even smaller net worth levels (n ≤ 0.002, only 3.2% of average loans)
if the economy heads into crisis or bad times (i.e. z = zM and z 0 ∈ {zC , zB }). Note that this
includes banks with negative net-worth ex-post (i.e., after the realization of z 0 but before
having the option to recapitalize the bank). In other aggregate states, ws the net-worth of
its competitors increase (either average net-worth of fringe banks or big bank net-worth),
fringe banks with low net-worth exit even with high level of deposits (δ ∈ {δL , . . . , δH }).
Dominant-bank exit is not observed along the equilibrium path. On the equilibrium path,
fringe banks that survive the arrival of a bad aggregate shock accumulate securities in order
to avoid future exit.

shows that higher volatility of external funding (i.e. σf,u

risk-weighted capital ratios (as a buffer) than big banks on average.

Capital ratios implied by the model’s equilibrium decision rules `θθ are illustrated in Figure
6 (big bank in the top panel and fringe banks in the bottom panel) when z = zM for different
values of z 0 . The figure also plots the capital requirement ϕθ,z = 0.04. As shown, capital
ratios are decreasing in the aggregate state of the economy (z) and, as described in Figure
5, much larger for fringe banks than for the big bank. Recall that the capital requirement
constraint in equation (23) must be satisfied ex-ante but can be violated ex-post as we see in
the data in Figures 3 and 4. The small buffer that big banks hold results in a bank in need
of recapitalization for low enough net worth when z = zC or z = zB . This in fact happens
on the equilibrium path and as shown in Figure 5 it is the case that big banks operate close
to or at the minimum. On the other hand, fringe banks hold a much larger buffer and while
operating at the minimum capital required (for continuing banks) is not a zero probability
28

To be precise, after simulating the model for T periods, we compute the average distribution of fringe
PT µ (n,δ)
banks µ̄f (n, δ) = t=1 f,tT
. We simulate the economy for 10, 000 periods and drop the first 2, 000 periods. Similarly, we compute the frequency of capital ratios that the big bank transits during the simulation.

32

event, only those with very low net worth end up being undercapitalized when z = zC and
subsequently exit. Since big banks face lower equity issuance costs than fringe banks and are
more efficient extending loans and have market power, their charter value is higher than that
of fringe banks, making recapitalizing a big bank a more profitable alternative than exiting
even when capital ratios are below the minimum. Fringe banks self-select into higher capital
ratios since recapitalizing the bank is not a profitable alternative in most cases. In summary,
the model is capable of generating big bank recapitalization and small bank failure.

Test I: Business Cycle Properties

We now move on to other economically important moments that the model was not calibrated
to match, so that these results can be considered a simple qualitative test (or consistency) of
the model with the data. Table 7 provides the correlation between key aggregate variables
with output in the data and in the model.29 We observe that, as in the data, the model
generates countercyclical loan interest rates, exit rates, default frequencies, charge-off rates,
price-cost margins, and markups. Moreover, the model generates procyclical entry rates as
29

We use the following dating conventions in calculating correlations. Since some variables depend on z and
µ (e.g., loan interest rates rL (z, µ)) and some other variables depend on z, µ, and z 0 , (e.g. default frequency
1 − p(R(rL (z, µ)), z 0 )), Table 7 displays corr(GDP (z, µ, z 0 ), x(z, µ)) and corr(GDP (z, µ, z 0 ), y(z, µ, z 0 )),
where x(z, µ) is any variable x that depends on (z, µ) and y(z, µ, z 0 ) is any variable y that depends on
(z, µ, z 0 ).

Figure 7 presents the evolution of the mass of fringe banks, the loan market share of
fringe banks as well as entry and exit rates over the business cycle. When the economy
enters into a recession, a larger fraction of fringe banks exit. The reduction in the number of
banks is compensated by entry of new banks. However, in some instances entry is gradual
and the level of competition is not restored immediately. This is an important amplification
mechanism that derives from endogenous changes in competition in our model. Downturns
that lead to a more concentrated industry are amplified. This figure also makes clear that
the model can generate endogenous cycles in bank level competition. While in the model
these cycles tend to be short lived, they are largely consistent with the evidence we presented
on banking industry dynamics.

Test II: Monetary Policy and Bank Lending

Kashyap and Stein ([46]) argued that if the bank lending channel of monetary policy is
correct, one should expect the loan portfolios of large and small banks to respond differently
to a contraction in monetary policy. We ask the question, is the impact of monetary policy on
lending behavior stronger for smaller banks who are more likely to have difficulty substituting
into non-deposit sources of external finance? They find strong empirical evidence in favor
of this bank lending channel. The result is driven largely by the smaller banks (those in the
bottom 95% of the size distribution). We perform a similar experiment with our model to
determine if it is qualitatively consistent with Kashyap and Stein’s empirical findings.
To understand their results, consider two small banks, both of which face limitations in
raising uninsured external finance. The banks are alike except that one has a much more
liquid balance sheet position than the other. Now imagine that these banks are hit by a
contractionary monetary shock, which causes them both to lose insured deposits. In the
extreme case where they cannot substitute at all toward other forms of finance, the asset
side of their balance sheets must shrink. But the more liquid bank can relatively easily
protect its loan portfolio, simply by drawing down on its large buffer stock of securities. In
35

contrast, the less liquid bank is likely to have to cut loans significantly if it does not want
to see its securities holdings sink to a dangerously low level.
We implement this policy experiment by analyzing how a permanent rise in the cost of
external debt finance (in particular, a one standard deviation increase r from 0.65% to 2.1%)
affects the balance sheet and lending behavior of banks of different sizes. We simulate the
model and construct a pseudo-panel of banks under each value of r.
We then follow Kashyap and Stein ([46]) and estimate the following panel regression by
bank size:
(41)
∆`it = a0 + a1 ∆r + a2 Xit + uit ,
where ∆`it denotes the growth rate of loans, ∆r is the measure of monetary impulse and
Xit are other bank or aggregate controls. To estimate this regression, we simulate the model
and construct a pseudo-panel of banks under each value of r. Table 8 presents the estimated
coefficients for banks of different sizes:

These regression results (i.e., a negative and more sizable coefficient on the monetary
impulse for small banks than big banks) are broadly consistent with their findings. A contraction in monetary policy does indeed lead to a decline in lending in all size categories
of small banks. Small banks find it harder to raise financing with instruments other than
deposits. Importantly, results show that the effect is larger the smaller the bank.
To understand the mechanism at play, Table 9 presents the aggregate and industry effects
of the unexpected policy change. We present the effects of the policy change in the short-run
(after five periods) and in the long-run.31 Increasing the cost of bank finance decreases the
31

In particular, we compute the initial conditions of the benchmark model as the average µ̄(n, δ) that
arises during the simulation of the model conditional on z = zM = 1. That is, µ̄(n, δ|z = zM ) =
PT
µθ,t (n,δ)
where Tz=zM is the number of periods such that z = zM . Using µ̄(n, δ|z = zM )
t=1 I{z=zM } Tz=zM
(that implies a value for M and N ) and z = zM as a starting point, the policy change is announced and
put into effect immediately. We simulate the economy forward using the decision rules of the model with

36

value of both types of banks in the short run as well as small banks in the long run. This
leads to high exit rates for small banks and a subsequent drop in the number (measure) of
small banks in the long run. Their loan and deposit market share decline considerably in
the short and long run. The tightening of monetary policy and the subsequent increase in
deposit finance costs of 145 basis points leads to a short run increase in loan rates of 71 basis
points and a long run rise of 119 basis points. Despite the rise in loan rates, net interest
margins fall by 74 basis points in the short run and 28 basis points in the long run. Further,
there is a large fall in markups. In summary, the model exhibits incomplete pass-through
of contractionary monetary policy which is consistent with models of imperfect competition
such as Dreschler, Savov, and Schnabl [31] who find (page 1854) that deposit spread betas
(with respect to changes in the fed funds rate) are less than one.

Test III: Competition-Stability Tradeoff

Many authors have tried to empirically estimate the relation between bank concentration/competition and banking system fragility using a reduced form approach. In this section, we follow this approach using simulated data from our model to show that the model
is qualitatively consistent with the empirical findings. As in Beck et. al. [11], we estimate
a logit model of the probability of a crisis as a function of the degree of banking industry
higher capital requirements. The moments reported as the “short-run” effects correspond to the moments
that arise five periods after the policy change and the “long-run” effects correspond to the average for a
10,000 period simulation. See the appendix for further details.

37

concentration and other relevant aggregate variables. Moreover, as in Berger et. al. [12], we
estimate a linear model of the aggregate default frequency as a function of banking industry
concentration and other relevant controls. The banking crisis indicator takes value equal
to one in periods whenever: (i) the loan default frequency is higher than 5%; (ii) deposit
insurance outlays as a fraction of GDP are higher than 2%; (iii) large dominant banks are
liquidated; or (iv) the exit rate is higher than two standard deviations from its mean. The
concentration index corresponds to the loan market share of the big bank. We use as extra
regressors the growth rate of GDP and lagged growth rate of loan supply.32 Table 10 displays
the estimated coefficients and their standard errors.

Consistent with the empirical evidence in Beck, et. al. [11], we find that banking system
concentration is highly significant and negatively related to the probability of a banking
crisis. The results suggest that concentrated banking systems are less vulnerable to banking
crises. Higher monopoly power induces periods of higher profits that prevent bank exit
(see also Corbae and Levine [25]). This is in line with the findings of Allen and Gale [5].
Consistent with the evidence in Berger et. al. [12] we find that the relationship between
concentration and loan portfolio risk is positive. This is in line with the view of Boyd and De
Nicolo [18], who showed that higher concentration is associated with riskier loan portfolios.

of this counterfactual. We present the effects of the policy change in the short-run (after five
model periods) and in the long-run.33
As Table 11 (see columns (ii) and (iii)) shows, we find that a rise in capital requirements
from 4% to 8.5% actually leads to an increase in long run exit rates of small banks from
the model’s long run benchmark of 2.10% to 4.38% and a more concentrated industry (a
decline in the loan market share of fringe banks from 67.8% to 64.3%). After the increase
in the minimum capital requirement, banks still sustain a significant capital buffer. In the
short run, big banks decide to strategically gain loan market share financed by issuing more
equity, cutting dividends, shifting out of securities, and retaining more earnings. This results
in a short run loss of market share of fringe banks of 23% and a long run loss of 5%. Most
of these changes in market share are explained by a drop in the number (measure) of fringe
banks in the economy but the intensive margin is also important (average lending by fringe
banks decline by 7.6% in the short run and 2.2% in the long run). The net effect of higher
big bank lending and lower small bank lending is a decrease in aggregate lending of 8.6%
in the short run and 3.3% in the long run. This leads to an increase in interest rates on
loans of 75 basis points in the short run but only a modest 28 basis points in the long run.
Higher interest rates lead to lower intermediated output (8.5% in the short run and 3.3%
in the long run), but lower costs of funding failed banks relative to output in the long run
(-25.5%). While there is an increase in exit rates due to lower profitability, the decline in
taxes to output derives from the fact that losses on failed banks decline. Exiting banks are
better capitalized and have a smaller share of their assets invested in loans whose recovery
is less than one.
The results on entry and exit follow from a selection effect. In the short run, after the
increase in capital requirements, banks with low net-worth and deposits prefer to exit and
liquidate the bank rather re-capitalize it. Small banks that are not well capitalized and
face a high cost of injecting equity into the bank shift their portfolio composition towards
securities which reduces their profitability. To analyze this in depth, we present an event
study of bank failure in the baseline economy and in the one with higher capital requirements.
We simulate a panel of banks in each case and collect all bank failures. We sort each bank
such that period 0 corresponds to its exit and take the average across banks in each period.
Figure 8 shows the evolution of average deposits for banks that exit (Panel (i)), their loan
to asset ratio (Panel (ii)), profits to assets (Panel (iii)), and equity to assets (Panel (iv)).
Figure 8 shows that exit is triggered by a significant decline in deposits (Panel (i)) but
importantly that banks that fail with higher capital requirements have a larger share of
securities to assets (or a smaller share of loans to assets, see Panel (ii)) and that leads to
lower profits to assets (panel (iii)). A relatively smaller decline in profits leads to failure
in the high capital requirements equilibrium. A selection effect is also evident in Panel (i)
that shows that the average value of delta is higher when capital requirements are higher.
This reinforces the shift in the portfolio composition. Finally, Panel (iv) shows that capital
ratios are higher in the equilibrium with higher capital requirements (as one would expect)
and that the decline in capital ratios are similar in the two economies.

Since the expected deposits (δ) for entrants is above the lowest value and profits for
incumbents increase (as shown in Table 11), higher capital requirements also leads to some
entry. In the long-run, the increase in the entry rate coincides with the increase in the failure
rate. It is also relevant to note that, while the failure rate by small banks is higher under
the new capital requirement regime, the probability of a crisis (as defined in Section 6.4)
declines in the long-run from 3.1% to 2.9%. Thus, higher capital requirements achieve their
objective of increasing financial stability.

7.2

Size Dependent Capital Requirements

Another proposal in Basel III calls for large, systemically important financial institutions
(SIFI) to face a higher capital requirement than small banks. Table 11 (see columns (iv)

41

and (v)) presents the model predictions for a counterfactual where the capital requirement
is 2% higher on big banks than small banks.
Relative to the benchmark where big banks faced an 8.5% capital requirement, the higher
rate of 10.5% in Table 11 (see columns (iv) and (v)) leads big banks to decrease their lending
in the short and the long run. Fringe banks also cut their lending; however, since the number
of fringe banks does not decline (the mass increases slightly in the long run) the loan market
share of fringe banks rises. The extensive margin is dominated by the intensive margin and
the combination of lower lending by big and small banks leads to a lower loan supply and
higher interest rates than in the baseline experiment.

7.3

Countercyclical Capital Requirements

Basel III calls for banks to maintain a “countercyclical” capital buffer of up to 2% of riskbased Tier 1 capital. More specifically, a buffer of capital will be required only during periods
of credit expansion. Since in our model aggregate credit and aggregate productivity are
highly correlated, we implement this change in capital regulation by setting the minimum
capital requirement to 8.5% in periods where z = zc and 11% in periods where zg . The
implementation in the U.S. calls for this countercyclical capital buffer to be applied only to
large banks, for this reason we set capital requirements for fringe banks at 8.5% (ϕθ,z = 0.085)
and let the capital requirements for big banks move with the cycle between 8.5% and 11.0%
(ϕb,zC = 0.085, ϕb,zB = 0.095, ϕb,zM = 0.103, ϕb,zG = 0.110). Table 11 (see columns (vi) and
(vii)) presents the model predictions.
Unsurprisingly, relative to the results in Subsection 7.1, we find even higher levels of
capital buffers held in this counterfactual. We find lower long run exit rates in Table 11
columns (vi) and (vii) than in columns (ii) and (iii), though still higher than the benchmark.
Unlike the previous case (higher capital requirements for large banks), we find that big banks
actually increase their lending resulting in a larger market share vis-a-vis fringe banks. The
reduction in the market share of fringe banks is also the result of a decline in lending by
fringe banks and the mass of incumbent banks. The overall effect is lower aggregate loan
supply which leads to higher long run interest rates by 55 basis points. Again, higher interest
rates lead to lower intermediated output, but significantly lower costs of funding failed banks
relative to output in the long run (-62%).

7.4

Risk Taking without Capital Requirements

Should there be capital requirements at all? Is the charter value of a bank sufficiently
valuable to induce a bank to self-insure and not take on too much risk? In this section, we
analyze the model predictions when capital requirements are completely absent.
As expected, both big and small banks lower their capital buffers in Table 11 columns
(viii) and (ix) when the capital requirement is lifted. However, in keeping with the charter
value hypothesis they do not set them to zero for fear of exit. While exit rates do rise, they
do not rise dramatically (again in keeping with the charter value hypothesis). Interestingly,
the probability of a banking crisis declines slightly from the baseline case.

42

7.5

Liquidity Requirements

Table 12 (columns (ii) and (iii)) presents the model predictions in response to a rise in
liquidity requirements (%θ ) from zero in the benchmark to 8% in the counterfactual. In
contrast to our previous results, higher liquidity requirements lead to lower exit rates. The
market share of fringe banks declines in both the short and long run. This decline is the
result not only of an increase in lending by the big bank but also a strong selection effect
(only the well funded small banks remain in the economy) resulting in a drop in the measure
of fringe banks in both the short and long run. Importantly, the implementation of liquidity
requirements without changing the level of capital requirements results in a much smaller
decline in the probability of a crisis from 3.11% to 3.01%.

7.6

Policy Interaction

Basel III introduced liquidity requirements and higher capital requirements together. Table
12 (columns (iv) and (v)) presents the model predictions when liquidity requirements are implemented jointly with higher capital requirements. Introducing higher capital requirements
together with liquidity requirements reduces the increase in small bank exit and entry rates
relative to the case with only higher capital requirements by more than 100 basis points.
Fringe banks hold a larger ratio of securities to assets. The decline in exit rates and the shift
toward safe assets results in a considerably larger decline in the cost of deposit insurance
(as a ratio to output). Higher concentration leads to higher interest rates and markups in
the long run. It is also worth noting that the probability of crisis reduces to one third of
its original value after implementing both policies together. The results in (columns (ii)
and (iii)) together with the results in Table 11 show that liquidity requirements and capital
requirements have large complementary effects on the probability of a crisis. The largest
decline in this probability is observed when both policies are combined and the sum of the
effects only accounts for a small fraction of the overall effect.

Policy with Perfect Competition

In this subsection, we ask, how much does an increase in capital requirements affect bank
outcomes under an assumption that all banks are perfectly competitive? This experiment
is meant to assess the interaction between market structure and changes in government
policy. It provides a comparison between our work and models with perfect competition

44

and an indeterminate bank-size distribution (such as Van Den Heuvel [63] and Aliaga-Diaz
and Olivero [3]). Since our model nests a perfectly competitive environment (our fringe
banks), we simply increase the entry cost for the big bank to a value that prevents entry.
All other parameters remain identical to those used for the benchmark model. The spirit
of this exercise is to endogenously generate an environment where all banks are perfectly
competitive (i.e., all banks take prices as given). Table 13 compares the responses to capital
requirement changes in both the benchmark imperfect competition environment to the same
policy change in the perfectly competitive model.
Without competition from big banks (moving from column 2 to column 4), there is a
significant inflow of fringe banks (a 32% increase) but not large enough to compensate for
the absence of the big bank. This results in a lower loan supply (11% lower) leading to higher
loan interest rates (a 95 basis points higher difference). Since fringe banks have higher net
marginal costs of extending loans than big banks, once the industry moves into one where
only fringe banks operate, a higher interest rate is needed to induce a charter value that is
consistent with the entry cost. However, this increase in interest rates is not associated with
higher markups. On the contrary, as one would expect markups decline substantially when
we move from the model with imperfect competition to the one with perfect competition (a
more than 60% decline). In a perfectly competitive environment, positive markups are only
necessary to cover entry costs and fixed operating costs. Further, the increase in interest
rates results in more risk taking by borrowers (0.17%) and a higher default frequency (a
0.33% difference).
Table 13 also shows an important increase in capital ratios (a 4.7% difference) between
the competitive environment and the benchmark. Banks’ portfolio compositions are driven
by the valuable smoothing role that securities provide in cases of bank distress (negative
profits) and the cost arising from differences in the expected spread of loans over securities.
In the competitive environment, higher interest rates induce banks to shift toward loans.

Table 14 compares volatility in the imperfect competition environment and the perfectly
competitive environment. Consistent with higher capital ratios under perfect competition,
this table makes clear that the volatility of virtually all aggregates is higher in the perfectly
competitive environment. The incentives to self-insure are increased and generate higher
capital ratios in the perfectly competitive economy than in the benchmark.

The main driving force of the increase in the volatility of aggregates when moving to
the perfectly competitive environment is the absence of large banks which take into account
that fringe banks respond to their lending decision and adjust lending preemptively. Figure
9 presents a scatter plot of `b against Lsf (the loan supply of the fringe sector) and its
components `f (the average loan supply by fringe banks and M (the mass of incumbents).

It is clear that big bank lending `b and fringe bank aggregate lending Lsf (as well as
47

its intensive margin and extensive margin components) move in opposite directions. Since
the variance of the aggregate loan supply can be written as Var(Ls ) = Var(`b ) + Var(Lsf ) +
2Cov(`b , Lsf ), the negative covariance between `b and Lf drives down the variance of the loan
supply and with it all other variables in the imperfectly competitive environment.
Moving now into the effects of higher capital requirements with perfect competition,
columns 4 and 5 of Table 13 show that, even though the capital requirement constraint
is not binding, on average banks endogenously increase their capital buffer (a nearly 5%
difference). Intuitively, since profitability of banks is lower when capital requirements are
higher, there is less entry and the measure of fringe banks falls (6% lower). A lower mass of
banks implies a higher loan interest rate (a 15 basis points difference) and a default frequency
that is slightly larger than that of the model with lower capital requirements. The higher
loan interest rate also results in fewer projects being operated and a lower intermediated
output (2% lower). The increase in capital ratios does not result in a significant change in
the exit rate. This is in contrast with what we see when we analyze the model with imperfect
competition.

7.8

Allocative Efficiency in the Banking Industry

An important aspect of the policy reforms that we studied is that they may change the level
of allocative efficiency in the economy by shifting lending between heterogeneous banks. In
order to explain this change and to provide a measure that captures how efficiently lending is
allocated in the economy, we use the following decomposition of weighted average bank-level
marginal cost (proposed originally by Olley and Pakes [55] to measure productivity):
XZ X
b
c≡
cθ (`0θ )ω(`0θ )dµθ = c + cov(c(`0θ ), ω(`0θ )),
θ

δθ

where b
c is the loan-weighted average of bank-level cost, cθ (`0θ ) is the net cost of extending `0θ
(as defined
(40)), ω(`0θ ) is the loan share, and c is the un-weighted mean cost (i.e.,
R P in equation
P
0
34
That is, loan weighted cost can be decomposed into two terms: the
θ
δθ cθ (`θ )dµθ ).
un-weighted average of bank-level cost and a covariance term between loan shares and cost.
A smaller value for the covariance term captures an improvement in allocative efficiency
(since the distribution of loans shifts towards banks with lower costs).
Table 15 shows the values for this decomposition. We observe that while average (unweighted) costs decline between 3.3% (with High Capital Requirements and Liquidity Requirements) and 7.0% (with Countercyclical Capital Requirements) relative to the baseline
economy, changes in loan-weighted costs range between approximately 0% (with Size Dependent Capital Ratios) and -13.1% (with Countercyclical Capital Ratios). A large fraction
(40% on average) of the decline in loan-weighted costs can be explained by an increase in
allocative efficiency (as measured by a smaller or more negative covariance term that results
in most cases).35 That is, for most policy experiments, we observe that the decline in loanweighted average costs results from a better allocation of loans across banks of different sizes

It should be evident that `0θ and µθ are functions of nθ and δθ .
For example, the decline in Avg. (loan-weighted) cost ĉ of moving to higher capital requirements is

and costs. This increase in allocative efficiency derives from a selection effect that is evident
in higher exit rates (lower survival of less efficient banks) and a lower mass of fringe banks in
all counterfactuals in which the covariance term declines (see also Tables 11 and 12). This
shift toward more efficient banks (including the rise in market share of lower cost big banks)
induces the efficiency gains.
Table 15 shows that Size Dependent Capital Requirements reduce allocative efficiency
significantly to the point where all the gains in average costs are lost. Intuitively, big banks
(who operate with lower average marginal costs) are the ones facing higher capital requirements and that results in a decline in their market share in the long-run.
In sum, after almost all policy changes, the distribution of loans shifts towards banks
with lower costs and that drives the improvement in allocative efficiency. This relationship
between banking regulation and allocative efficiency is consistent with the findings of Berger
and Hannon [14] that present evidence in favor of efficiency gains from an increase in bank
concentration.

Welfare Implications of Capital and Liquidity Requirements

To assess the welfare consequences of changes in banking regulation that we presented in
the previous subsections, we ask the question, “What would households and entrepreneurs
be willing to pay (or be paid) to increase capital and liquidity requirements?”
To answer this question, we calculate ex-ante consumption equivalents for each type of
agent: households and entrepreneurs. Specifically, let {Ctpre }∞
t=0 be the equilibrium sequence
of aggregate household consumption in the baseline economy (i.e., pre- capital and liquidity
requirements reforms). In addition, let {Ctpost }∞
t=0 be the equilibrium sequence of aggregate
household consumption post-reforms (i.e., after, for example, minimum capital requirements
increase to 8.5%). The welfare gain for the representative household as a result of the
reforms is defined as the constant percentage increase in consumption in the pre-reform case
equal to 1.64-1.75=-0.11. The change in the term that measures allocative efficiency (i.e, cov(c, ω)) equals
-0.06-(-0.01)=-0.05. Then, 45.5% (-0.05/-0.11) of the change in loan-weighted cost ĉ can be explained by an
increase in allocative efficiency. The rest is explained by changes in average costs.

that gives the household the same expected utility as when the corresponding reform is
implemented. Thus, the welfare gain (or loss if negative) for the household is the value of
αH that solves the following equation:
"∞

β t Ctpost = E0

t=0

Equation (42) makes clear that, since household preferences are linear, computing ex-ante
consumption equivalents amounts to computing the difference between long-run aggregate
pre ∞
household consumption. Similarly, let {CE,t
}t=0 denote the equilibrium sequence of aggrepost ∞
gate entrepreneurs’ consumption pre-reforms and {CE,t
}t=0 the equilibrium consumption
sequence post-reforms. The welfare gain (or loss if negative) for entrepreneurs is the value
of αE that solves the following equation:

consumption equivalent for a utilitarian planner that assigns equal weight to all agents in
the economy is given by

A note of caution about our welfare measure before presenting our results. Since we
work with linear preferences, our welfare measure does not capture the effects of changes
in aggregate volatility.36 Hence, our measure of welfare gains should be taken as a lower
bound in cases in which consumption volatility declines and as an upper bound in cases in
which volatility increases. Moreover, in this paper, we focus on an equilibrium that takes as
given (i.e., as determined uniquely by government policy) the return on safe securities rA .
This price would be subject to change in a full general equilibrium model (i.e., a model that
captures how changes in demand for securities affects is price).
Table 16 presents the average welfare gain (or loss if negative) for each reform as well
as the change in the standard deviation of consumption for each type of agent (∆σCH and
∆σCE for consumers and entrepreneurs, respectively) and for the aggregate (i.e, the weighted
average). The table shows that adjusting capital and liquidity regulation generates significant
welfare losses in the short-run (between -1.216% and -0.724%) and more modest welfare
gains in the long-run (between 0.140% and 0.205%). While short run losses are uniform
across the agents in the economy (i.e., consumers and entrepreneurs), long-run gains are
driven by the observed higher household consumption. Except for the size dependent capital
requirements, the average standard deviation of consumption increases (between 20.51% and
34.59%), implying that our results can be thought as an upper bound.
36

Linear preferences are also consistent with a constant banks’ discount factor.

Note: αH and αE are defined in equations (42) and (43). Positive values correspond to a welfare gain from
the reform and a negative value corresponds to a welfare loss.

Starting with the welfare effects after increasing capital requirements to 8.5%, Table 16
shows that agents lose close to 1.0% in consumption terms in the short-run but the loss is
reversed for households in the long-run resulting in an aggregate welfare gain. Short run
losses can be explained by the significant increase in the cost of funding deposit insurance
(due to the higher exit rate), the cost of recapitalizing the banks that continue operating
under the new regime, and the reduction in intermediated output. In the long-run, the
positive change in household consumption is explained by an increase in dividend payments
from incumbent banks (mostly fringe banks, consistent with the increase in dividend to asset
ratio shown in Table 11) and from a reduction in taxes to pay for deposit insurance (-50%)
that results from better capitalized failing banks (i.e., failing banks suffer smaller losses).
Since holdings of securities increase, taxes to service these securities also increase (+25%) as
well as the aggregate cost of initial equity injections to cover entry costs (+62%). However,
these losses are not enough to reverse the factors pushing consumption higher. As in the
short-run, the negative value for the entrepreneurs’ welfare can be explained almost one to
one by the reduction in the fraction of projects being operated and lower output (shown in
Table 11).
The welfare results for the remaining cases are driven by the same factors. Short-term
losses derive, to a large extent, from an increase in taxes to finance deposit insurance, the cost
of recapitalizing incumbent banks, the increase in initial equity injections, and the reduction
in intermediated output that reduces entrepreneur’s consumption. The case of the higher
capital and liquidity requirement joint policy is slightly different in that taxes to finance
deposit insurance decline in the short-run. However, the other factors generating a decline
in household consumption are larger than this positive effect and short-term losses are still
present. The long-term gains for consumers can be explained by the decline in the cost of
deposit insurance, and a higher flow of dividends from incumbent fringe banks. While most
51

cases display a significant increase in consumption volatility, the case with size dependent
capital requirements results in a modest decline. This is driven by a decline in volatility of
dividend payments from big banks which are forced to shift their portfolio towards securities
which pay a constant return.

Directions for Future Research

The main data source for our paper, like that of Kashyap and Stein, is the Consolidated
Report of Condition and Income submitted to the Federal Reserve. That public Call Report data simply provides aggregate information on commercial bank balance sheets such
as commercial loans, etc. As discussed in an important empirical paper by Jimenez, et.
al. [45], credit demand and balance- sheet channels have testable predictions at the firm or
bank level, but one aspect of the bank risk-taking channel involves compositional changes in
credit supply at the bank-firm level. Since our call report data does not allow us to identify
this aspect of the bank risk-taking channel, we have not included borrower heterogeneity
in our model. Bank risk-taking in our framework is associated with loan extension across
particular states of the world associated with aggregate shocks and bank level heterogeneity.
It would, however, be possible to extend our framework to include borrower heterogeneity.
Specifically, here borrowers are ex-ante identical but ex-post heterogeneous. Private information about borrower outside options with one-period lived borrowers results in pooling loan
contracts and one aggregate state dependent loan rate (as in Bernanke and Gertler [13]). In
our previous work [23], our spatial framework included regional specific shocks to borrower
production technologies which were observable and contractible generating heterogeneity in
interest rates across different location specific borrowers. To address the type of heterogeneity found in the Jimenez, et. al. data, we could include heterogeneity in the success/failure
across borrower projects. In particular, the success of a borrower’s project, which occurs
with probability ph (Rt , zt+1 ), could be independent across borrowers of type h ∈ {H, L} but
depends on the borrower’s choice of technology Rt ≥ 0 at the beginning of the period and an
aggregate technology shock at the end of the period denoted zt+1 . Riskier borrowers would
then be modeled, ceteris paribus, through the assumption that pH (Rt , zt+1 ) < pL (Rt , zt+1 ) <
where H stands for “High” risk and L stands for “Low” risk. Banks would continue to pool
the idiosyncratic uncertainty within a risk class, but depending on informational assumptions
associated with screening would offer a targeted menu of contracts to borrowers resulting in
a distribution of loan rates much the same way as in Chatterjee, et. al. [19].
Another direction for future research is to incorporate mergers into the model. One
reduced form way is to enrich the size-dependent autoregressive funding shock process in
equation (36) to include a jump process to model random mergers that discretely increase
the size of a given bank. Since failures and Mergers & Acquisitions come in waves, but the
sum of exit by failure plus M&A is less variable owing to the countercyclicality of failures
and procyclicality of M&A (see McCord and Prescott [52] Table 4 for the recent experience),
we have not modeled mergers in our already complex model. One important factor in
M&A activity is deregulation. In our previous work Corbae and D’Erasmo [23], our spatial
framework included regional and national banks with market power. One experiment (in
52

Subsection 7.2) that we ran was to raise the entry cost for national banks in order to consider
an economy with branching restrictions creating a system of regional banks prior to the mid
1990s that was largely the result of the McFadden Act in 1927. Then we interpreted results
from a decrease in entry costs for national banks as a regulatory change eliminating branching
restrictions such as the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994
which induced consolidation via mergers. There we found that branching restrictions actually
raised concentration in the regional markets, lowering loan supply and raising interest rates.
In the presence of region specific shocks, consolidation to a national bank generated a more
diversified loan portfolio and competition between regional and national banks generated
lower interest rates post deregulation.

Computational Algorithm

We solve the model using a variant of Krusell and Smith [48] and Ifrach and Weintraub [43].
The main difficulty arises in approximating the distribution of fringe banks and computing
the reaction function from the fringe sector to clear the loan market:
Z
`b (n, δ, z, µ) +
`f (n, δ, z, nb , δb , µ, `b )dµ(n, δ) = Ld (rL , z).
| N×D
{z
}
=Lsf (z,nb ,δb ,µ,`b )

As part of the solution algorithm, we iterate on these functions until finding a fixed point.
Note that since the big bank is a dominant player (i.e., it has market power), its individual
state variables {nb , δb } are part of the state space of fringe banks. This allows fringe banks
incorporate in full the equilibrium big bank’s loan decision when making their own loan
decisions.
Another difficulty in solving this problem arises due to the fact that µ is an infinitely
large object. For this reason, we approximate the cross-sectional distribution of fringe banks
using a finite set of moments:
• The cross-sectional avg of net-worth plus deposits (denoted by N ) since that determines
feasible loan and asset choices at the beginning of the period
Z
(n + δ)dµ(n, δ),
N =
N×D

• The mass of incumbent fringe banks (denoted M) where
Z
dµ(n, δ).
M=
N×D

This moment is relevant since the model features endogenous entry and exit and the
mass of incumbent bank fluctuates with the business cycle.
The evolution of these moments is approximated using log-linear functions that have {nb , δb , z,
N , M, z 0 } as states. In order to predict the evolution of the mass of banks M0 we use the
solution to the problem of the entrant (that provides Me0 ) and use a log-linear function to
predict the mass of survivors after exit (denoted by M0x ). The mass of entrants Me0 , survivors
M0x and future incumbents M0 are linked since the distribution evolves according to:

In summary, in equilibrium, the state space of the big bank is {nb , δb , z, N , M} and the
state for each fringe banks is {nf , δf , z, N , M, nb , δb }. This implies that for each combination
of state variables {nb , δb , z, N , M}, in order to find an equilibrium, and in addition to solving
the problem of the big bank and the fringe banks, we iterate on the aggregate functions as
well as `b (·) and Lsf (·) until we find a fixed point (i.e. the equilibrium in the Stackelberg
game):
`∗b (nb , δb , z, N , M) + Lsf (nb , δb , z, N , M, `∗b (·)) = Ld (rL , z).
More specifically, to find an equilibrium we perform the following steps:
1. Guess aggregate functions. Make an initial guess of Lsf (nb , δb , z, N , M), Me0 and the
law of motion for N 0 and M0x where M0x is the mass of survivors after exit decisions
(note that M0 = max{M0x , M + M0e }) .
Lsf = H L (nb , δb , z, N , M).
0

N = H N (nb , δb , z, N , M, z 0 ).
0
Mx = H Mx (nb , δb , z, N , M, z 0 ).
2. Solve the dominant bank problem to obtain the big bank value function and decision
rules.
3. Solve the problem of fringe banks to obtain the fringe bank value function and
decision rules.
4. Solve the entry problem of the fringe bank and big bank to obtain the number of
entrants as a function of the state space.
5. Simulate to obtain a sequence {nb,t , δb,t , Nt , Mt , Mx,t , Me,t }Tt=1 .
6. If convergence achieved (i.e., if the evolution of aggregate variables during the simulation is consistent with those implied by the aggregate functions used to solve the
banks’ problem) stop. If not, update the aggregate functions and return to (2).

Equilibrium Aggregate Functions

We use linear equations to estimate the evolution of aggregate variables. Table A.1 presents
the estimated coefficients for the function H N (nb , δb , z, N , M, z 0 ). Each column presents the

Computing Policy Counterfactuals

We present the results of the policy changes in the short-run and in the long-run. To
perform these experiments we proceed as follows. First, we compute the initial conditions of
the benchmark model as the average µ̄(n, δ) that arises during the simulation of the model
P
µ (n,δ)
where Tz=1 is the number
conditional on z = 1. That is, µ̄(n, δ|z = 1) = Tt=1 I{z=1} θ,t
Tz=1
of periods such that z = 1. Using µ̄(n, δ|z = 1) (that implies a value for M and N ) and
z = 1 as a starting point, the policy change is announced and put into effect immediately.
We assume that once the policy change takes effect banks implement the decision rules of the
model with higher capital requirements. Using these decision rules we simulate the economy
forward. The moments reported as the “short-run” effects correspond to the moments that
arise in the first period after the policy change has been implemented and the “long-run”
effects correspond to the average of the economy for a 10,000 period simulation.

Test I: Business Cycle Properties

We present business cycle correlations as qualitative test of the model. Table 7 provides the
correlation between key aggregate variables with output. This appendix presents the graphical representation of those correlations and the estimated coefficient of a linear regression
between the corresponding variable and output.37 Figure A.1 plots a set of scatter plots of
37

We use the following dating conventions in calculating correlations. Since some variables depend on z and
µ (e.g., loan interest rates rL (z, µ)) and some other variables depend on z, µ, and z 0 , (e.g. default frequency

We observe that, as in the data, the model generates countercyclical loan interest rates,
exit rates, default frequencies, charge-off rates, price-cost margins, and markups. Moreover,
the model generates procyclical entry rates as well as aggregate loans and deposits.

Data Appendix

We compile a large panel of banks from 1984 to 2016 using data for the last quarter of
each year.38 The source for the data is the Consolidated Report of Condition and Income
1 − p(R(rL (z, µ)), z 0 )), Table 7 displays corr(output(z, µ, z 0 ), x(z, µ)) and corr(output(z, µ, z 0 ), y(z, µ, z 0 )),
where x(z, µ) is any variable x that depends on (z, µ) and y(z, µ, z 0 ) is any variable y that depends on
(z, µ, z 0 ).
38
There was a major overhaul to the Call Report format in 1984. Since 1984 banks are, in general, required
to provide more detailed data concerning assets and liabilities. Due to changes in definitions and the creation
of new variables after 1984 some of the variables are only available after this date.

A.5

(known as Call Reports) that banks submit to the Federal Reserve each quarter.39 Report
of Condition and Income data are available for all banks regulated by the Federal Reserve
System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Comptroller of the Currency. All
financial data are on an individual bank basis.
We consolidate individual commercial banks to the bank holding company level and retain
those bank holding companies and commercial banks (if there is not top holder) for which
the share of assets allocated to commercial banking (including depository trust companies,
credit card companies with commercial bank charters, private banks, development banks,
limited charter banks, and foreign banks) is higher than 25 percent. We follow Kashyap and
Stein [47] and den Haan, Summer and Yamashiro [26] in constructing consistent time series
for our variables of interest. Finally, we only include banks located within the fifty states
and the District of Columbia. (0 <RSSD9210< 57). In addition to information from the
Call Reports, we identify bank failures using public data from the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC).40 We also identify mergers and acquisitions using the Transformation
table in the Call Reports.
To deflate balance sheet and income statement variables we use the CPI index. To compute business cycle correlations, variables are detrended using the HP filter with parameter
6.25. When we report weighted aggregate time series we use the asset market share as weight.
To control for the effect of a small number of outliers, when constructing the loan returns,
cost of funds, charge offs rates and related series we eliminate observations in the top and
bottom 1% of the distribution of each variable. We also control for the effects of bank entry,
exit and mergers by not considering the initial period, the final period or the merger period
(if relevant) of any given bank.
Tables A.4 and A.5 present the balance sheet variables, the income statement variables
and derived variables used respectively.
