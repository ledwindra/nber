Equilibrium Wage and Employment Dynamics in a Model of Wage Posting without Commitment

ABSTRACT
A rich but tractable variant of the Burdett-Mortensen model of wage setting behavior is formulated
and a dynamic market equilibrium solution to the model is defined and characterized. In the model,
firms cannot commit to wage contracts. Instead, the Markov perfect equilibrium to the wage setting
game, characterized by Coles (2001), is assumed. In addition, firm recruiting decisions, firm entry
and exit, and transitory firm productivity shocks are incorporated into the model.
Given that the cost of recruiting workers is proportional to firm employment, we establish the existence
of an equilibrium solution to the model in which wages are not contingent on firm size but more productive
employers always pay higher wages. Although the state space, the distribution of workers over firms,
is large in the general case, it reduces to a scalar that can be interpreted as the unemployment rate in
the special case of homogenous firms. Furthermore, the equilibrium is unique. As the dimension of
the state space is equal to the number of firms types in general, an (approximate) equilibrium is computable.

Introduction

The model studied in this paper is one in which employers set the wage
paid, in the tradition of Diamond (1971), Burdett and Judd (1983), Burdett and Mortensen (1998), Coles (2001) and Moscarini and Postel-Vinay
(2010). It diﬀers from these papers by introducing recruiting behavior at a
cost of the form estimated by Merz and Yashiv (2007), firm entry and exit,
and a transitory firm productivity shock. Like Moscarini and Postel-Vinay
(2010) our purpose is to propose a rich but tractable dynamic variant of the
Burdett-Mortensen model that can be used for both macro economic and
policy applications. Following Coles (2001), the paper develops the implications of a sub-game perfect solution in Markov strategies to the wage setting
game when firms cannot precommit to contracts that specify future wages.
Interest in this case arises because the Burdett-Mortensen solution is not
generally time consistent.
In the environment studied, there are many workers and firms, indeed
a continuum of each. A firm can have many workers in the model. As is
standard in this literature, every agent, worker and firm, is risk neutral and
acts to maximize the expected present value of future income. Workers,
employed as well as unemployed, randomly seek job vacancies that arise only
sequentially. Each firm chooses a current wage and recruiting strategy and
each worker follows a job acceptance and quit strategy that are respectively
optimal given those of all other agents under rational expectations regarding
the future evolution of the market state. For the specification of the cost of
recruiting and hiring considered, one in which the cost is proportional to the
number of employees, the wage paid and the hiring strategy pursued by any
firm are both independent of firm size. This fact provides the simplification
needed for tractability without violating the empirical relationships found in
micro firm data.
In the language of Moscarini and Postel-Vinay (2010), a market equilibrium is rank-preserving if the rank of each firm’s lifetime wage oﬀer in the
market wage oﬀer distribution is its rank in the distribution of productivity
at every point in time. In such an equilibrium, turnover is eﬃcient in the
2

sense that every worker moves from a less to a more productive firm when
an opportunity arise. Although Moscarini and Postel-Vinay (2010) demonstrate the existence of a recursive rank-preserving equilibrium, restrictions
on initial conditions are required. Specifically, because the wage strategy is
size dependent in their model, higher paying firms must be larger initially.
Unfortunately, this condition is violated in real data because firms die and
new firms enter relatively small, independent of productivity. Although this
possibility is incorporated in our model, their condition is not needed because
a firm’s size does not directly aﬀect the optimal wage choice given the cost
of hiring and recruiting function assumed.
Given the restrictions on primitives needed to guarantee the existence of
bounded values for all agents in our model, we show that an essentially unique
recursive rank-preserving equilibrium exists in the special case of equally
productive firms. Formally, any equilibrium solution is isomorphic to the
unique stable saddle path of a ordinary diﬀerential equation system that
describes the adjustment dynamics of the value of a job-worker match and
aggregate employment to their unique steady state values. In the case of
firm heterogeneity with respect to productivity, we establish the existence
of at least one rank preserving equilibrium when the distribution of firm
productivity is approximated by a discrete distribution.
Menzio and Shi (2010) develop and study a recursive model of directed
search that also allows for search on-the-job. In their paper, they suggest
that directed search is a more useful approach for understanding labor market dynamics. They claim that models of random search in the BurdettMortensen tradition are intractable because the decision relevant state space
is the evolving distribution of wages, which is of infinite dimension. Although
the directed search model in arguably simpler in some respects, their principal objection to a random search model is simply not valid in the variant
considered in the paper. The shape of the wage oﬀer c.d.f. at any point
in time is an equilibrium outcome of the wage and recruiting behavior of
firms and the acceptance and quit strategy of worker with a location determined by the distribution of employment over firm types. Hence, at least as
an approximation, the decision relevant state variable is a finite vector that
characterizes this distribution. Indeed, in the special case of identical firms,
the state variable is simply the aggregate level of employment.
A troublesome implication of the original Burdett-Mortensen model for
empirical implementation is that the implied equilibrium oﬀer and wage distributions are convex while in the data they are unimodal and well approx3

imated by the log normal (See Christiansen et al. (2005)). Although a
unimodal distribution is possible when firms diﬀer in labor productivity,
Mortensen (2003) shows that model is not consistent with both the firm
wage distribution and the distribution of firm productivity in Danish data.
The theoretical distribution of productivity which is consistent with the wage
distribution is far more skewed to the right than that observed. The inconsistency reflects the fact that high wage firms have much less incentive to
compete for workers by paying a higher wage than do low wage firms because workers only move up the wage ladder.
The Coles (2001) solution to the wage setting game, supported by appropriate quit behavior of employees, is such that every firm is indiﬀerent
between oﬀering a high wage and the workers’ common reservation wage.
Like the Burdett-Mortensen model, firms of equal productivity do pay different wages. However, the high wage which is actually paid in equilibrium
is simply equal to the saving in turnover costs that would have to be incurred where the reservation wage paid instead. In the special case in which
recruiting costs are primarily those associated with processing applications
and training workers rather than advertising the job opening, this condition
implies that the equilibrium distribution of oﬀers is uniformly distributed
over the set of firms that are equally productive. Furthermore, the oﬀer
density is decreasing when firms diﬀer in productivity. Finally, the properties of the employment weighted distribution of wage, a distribution which
is stationary only in steady state, can be quite complex.

2.1

The Model
Specification

Time is continuous, has an infinite horizon and all discount the future at rate
  0. The labor market is populated by a unit measure of equally productive, risk neutral immortal workers. Every worker is either unemployed or
employed, earns a wage if employed, and the value of home production,  ≥ 0,
if not. There is also a measure of risk neutral, heterogeneous firms. Market
output is produced by matched workers and firms with a linear technology.
New firms enter at rate   0 continuing firms die at rate   0 so that
the measure of firms is stationary and equal to  At entry, the productivity of a new firm  is determined as a random draw from the c.d.f. Γ0 ()
4

Continuing firms are subject to a technology jump process characterized by a
given arrival rate  ≥ 0 and a distribution of new values Γ1 () The common
support of both distributions is [ ] and, for ease of exposition, Γ0  Γ1 are
continuous functions (no mass points). As in Klette and Kortum (2005) and
Lentz and Mortensen (2010), one can think of the entry flow as firms with
new products and the exit flow as firms that are destroyed because their
product is no longer in demand.
Given the above productivity and turnover processes, it is a straightforward algebraic exercise to compute the stationary distribution of firm productivity Φ() and show that it is a continuous and increasing function over
[ ] It is convenient, however, to instead rank firms by their productivity;
i.e. a firm with productivity  is equivalently described as having rank
 ∈ [0 1] solving  = Φ() Defining () = Φ−1 () each firm is then
characterized by ( ; ) where  describes its rank (with corresponding productivity  = ())  describes its (integer) number of employees and  the
aggregate state vector.
Throughout we only consider stationary (Markov) equilibria where the
market state process { } is Markov and known to all agents. As all agents
are small, each takes this process as given. At time  in state  =   firm
( ; ) generates expected discounted profit Π( ; ) by paying wage  =
( ; ) to each of its employees and by recruiting additional employees
at an expected rate  = ( ; ).  ( ; ) denotes a worker’s expected
lifetime wage when employed by such a firm while  () denotes the expected
value of being unemployed. Below we will derive the information relevant
state from the structure of the model. To fix ideas, however, it is useful to
define  ( ) as the distribution of employment across firms in the market
at time  In what follows, this distribution function can be considered as
the market state variable   Given this state variable at time  and the
wage strategies of firms, one can then compute  ( ) defined as the date
 proportion of workers who enjoy lifetime value at least as great as 
As no employee finds    acceptable,  ( ) then describes the date
 unemployment rate Finally for  ≥    ( ) −  ( ) is the date 
proportion of workers who are employed with lifetime value  or less.
New firms enter with a single worker, the innovator. Once a new firm
enters, the innovator sells the firm to risk neutral investors for its value and
reverts to his/her role as a worker. Each firm faces costs of expanding its
labour force. Suppose firm ( ; ) posts  vacancies and, with a random
contact technology, let () describe the rate at which this firm contacts
5

potential new employees. As employment at the firm yields worker value
 =  ( ; ) then  ( ) is the probability that a randomly contacted
worker is willing to accept the job oﬀer. Thus to hire a new employee at rate
 the firm must post  vacancies satisfying  = () ( ) Note that
firms which pay lower wages need to post more vacancies to achieve a given

There are two costs to the recruiting and hiring workers. First  describes the direct cost of posting  vacancies to attract the required number
of hires Second and perhaps more importantly, vetting job applicants and
training new hires is costly. Let  describe the firm’s recruitment eﬀort
required per employee. If each employee contributes to the recruiting process
equally, the cost of hiring at rate  is () where () describes the per
employee cost.1 The cost of recuriting at rate  at firm ( ; ) is then

+ ()
() ( )
where we () is increasing and strictly convex by assumption.
At rate  each worker, whether employed or unemployed, conceives a new
business idea and so has the opportunity to start-up a new firm. We assume
the worker always chooses to accept the opportunity and so  describes the
entry rate of new firms. This of course requires that an employed worker
always prefers to quit to start-up a new firm rather than remain employed
with its existing firm, a condition which holds under the assumption that new
firms are suﬃciently more productive than continuing firms. Of course, this
requirement holds automatically when each new product is more valuable
than the one it replaces as in the model of Klette and Kortum (2004).2
Finally, given firm ( ; ) oﬀers value  =  ( ; ), employees quit
at rate ( ; ) =  + ()[1 −  ( ; )] where  is the rate of firm creation
per employee, () is the job oﬀer arrival rate per employee, and  ( ; ) is
the probability that any outside job oﬀer is less than or equal to  . These
objects are determined endogenously in equilibrium.
1

This formulation of costs of adjustment is standard in the literature. As a case in
point, see Merz and Yashiv (2007).
2
This restriction is made for simplicity. Were it not so, then the entry decision is
endogenous to the process under study. Adding this complication is both realistic and
worth pursuing but goes beyond the scope of this paper.

2.2

The Wage Setting Game

With precommitment at date  = 0 on the entire path of future wages,
Moscarini and Postel-Vinay (2010) construct Markov Perfect Equilibria to
the extended Burdett and Mortensen (1998) framework [BM from now on]
where wage strategies are conditioned on initial firm size. Here we assume
no precommitment on future wages and consider the continuous time limit
 → 0+ . Suppose in the model described above that a Markov Perfect
Equilibrium exists in which the equilibrium wage strategy of firm ( ; ) is
to set wage  = ( ; ) with probability one (independent of the previous history). Further suppose this wage strategy yields lifetime value
 ( ; )   () to its employees Consider then the following wage deviation - the firm sets wage  = 0 In the subgame (after a   0 delay),
the firm’s strategy implies it reverts with probability one to the equilibrium
wage 0 = (0  0 ; 0 ) But as  → 0 Coles (2001) argues this wage deviation is always profitable. The reason is transparent in the steady state case:
if employees at the highest wage firm always expect wage  = , their quit
strategy is unchanged if the firm (only momentarily) announces  = 0 But
this cannot describe (subgame perfect) equilibrium behavior as the firm can
then profitably deviate by (always momentarily) announcing  = 03
The dynamic inconsistency in BM is that once a firm has grown to be large
then, rather than announce a high wage  it is strictly better oﬀ by announcing the worker’s reservation wage  (to extract incumbent employee search
rents). Coles (2001) identifies a dynamically consistent (Markov) equilibrium
where instead each firm ( ; ) has two optimal strategies: the equilibrium
wage path  = ( ; ) which we will refer to as the high wage path, and
the rip-oﬀ strategy  = ( ; ) which leaves each employee indiﬀerent to
quitting into unemployment (but does not do so by convention) The firm’s
equilibrium (Markov) pricing strategy (for   0 but arbitrarily small) is:
(a) if last period the firm announced wage 0 ≥ (0  0 ; 0 ) then announce
3

The argument clearly extends to mixed strategies. It essentially establishes there
cannot be a Markov perfect equilibrium with    (any firm will deviate to  = 0) A
MPE exists if it is assumed workers cannot quit until the end of the   0 period: in that
case the unique MPE is that all firms pay  =  and there is no quit turnover. Conversely
if instead workers can quit at the start of the period and all other firms oﬀer  =  then
 =  +  is a profitable deviation. As the only candidate MPE is that  =   a MPE
cannot then exist. We believe the latter scenario is the more interesting case as it presumes
firms can precommit to a higher wage to attract new employees, though only for a (very)
limited period.

7

 = ( ; );
(b) if last period the firm announced wage 0  (0  0 ; 0 ) then announce
 = ( ; )
Note the critical property: if the firm ever announces a wage below the
high wage path ( ; ), employees expect the rip-oﬀ strategy thereafter.
This switch in employee expectations on future wages generates a suﬃciently
large change in turnover behavior that setting wage below ( ; ) is never
profit increasing. Specifically the arguments developed in Coles (2001) establish for   0 but arbitrarily small:
(i) announcing a deviating higher wage 0  ( ; ) has such a small
impact on turnover that oﬀering 0 = ( ; ) is strictly more profitable;
(ii) announcing 0 ∈ ( ( ; )) which implies workers expect the
wage  =  in the entire future, has such a small impact on turnover that
oﬀering 0 =  is strictly more profitable; while
(iii) oﬀering 0   say 0 = 0 implies all workers quit (they anticipate
 =  in the entire future) and so yields zero profit.
Coles (2001) shows this equilibrium (as  → 0) yields the original (steady
state) outcome described in BM when the discount rate  is arbitrarily small.
The approach is particularly useful here for two reasons. First the equilibrium
wage path  = ( ; ) remains Markov and so can be embedded into a
non-steady state framework. Second it yields two key simplifications:
(i) the rip-oﬀ strategy  =  implies each firm with ()   and  ≥ 1
must make strictly positive profit;
(ii) for all  the high wage path implies  ( ; ) ≥  4 Thus unemployed workers and workers employed at firms using the rip-oﬀ strategy will
accept the first (outside) job oﬀer received.

2.3

The Reservation Wage

Because individual workers are hired and quit sequentially, the number of
employees in a continuing firm is a stochastic process. Indeed,  is a birthdeath process with an absorbing state that occurs when the firm dies. That
is, the firm’s labor force size is an integer that can only transit from the value
 to +1 if a worker is hired, from  to −1 if a worker quits, or to zero if the
firm loses its market in any suﬃciently short time period of length   0 .
4

   generates zero profit and this strategy is then dominated by the ripoﬀ strategy
(strictly if ()  )

8

The transition rates for these three events are respectively the hire frequency
( ; ), the quit frequency ( ; ), and the destruction frequency .
c0 () = Γ0 (()) and Γ
c1 () = Γ1 (()) for  ∈ [0 1] Consider a
Define Γ
worker in firm ( ; ) that follows the equilibrium high wage path ( ; ).
The value of employment or lifetime wage  ( ; ) solves the recursive
equation:

In other words, the flow value of employment is equal to the wage income plus
the expected capital gain associated with the possibility of firm destruction, a
firm specific productivity shock, being oﬀered a better job, creating a business
start-up, a quit by another employee, a new hire, and the passage of time,
all conditional on the market state . The latter term captures the eﬀect on
 through the non-steady state evolution of  over time.
The equilibrium construction requires the firm is everywhere indiﬀerent
between sticking to the high wage path or deviating (in perpetuity) to the ripoﬀ strategy  = ( ; ) where () is the wage at which an employee is just
indiﬀerent to quitting into unemployment. Now the value of unemployment

comparing with the Bellman equation for  implies that the reservation
wage,
( ; ) = 
(3)
is the value of home production in all circumstances.

2.4

The Size Independent Wage and Recruiting Policy

We now establish that the equilibrium wage strategy is size independent. In
the case of an operating firm with  ≥ 1 employees the value of this firm
( ; ) is defined recursively by

* (() − ( ; ))  − () ( ) − () +

where the right hand side contains the current cash flow, the return to recruiting an additional employee, the cost of losing an employee, the likelihood
of a productivity shock and the passage of time respectively.
The equilibrium construction requires the firm is indiﬀerent to the rip-oﬀ
strategy which, by equation (3), is to set  =  in perpetuity (and thus yield
employee value  ()) The value of this deviating strategy is therefore:

As () is size independent it is immediate that the equilibrium wage ()
must also be independent of size  With a slight abuse of notation, we now
write  = (; ) and note the lifetime value of employment must also be
size independent; i.e.  =  (; )
Before simplifying the model further, it is important to note this sizeindependence result is not solely a consequence of the assumed cost structure (). At this stage we could set () to zero, so that the only cost to
hiring workers is the standard vacancy posting cost, and the size independence result remains. The essential diﬀerence to previous work is that here
firms can directly control the hiring margin with a recruitment strategy 
leaving the firm’s wage strategy to control its employee quit rate. Indeed we
5

by assumption the firm using the rip-oﬀ strategy can recruit unemployed workers as
 ≤   

11

show below that the equilibrium wage paid depends only on the return to
reducing employee quit rates. Instead when wages are used to control both
the recruitment rate of new employees and the quit rate of existing employees, as in BM, Coles (2001) Moscarini and Postel-Vinay (2010), the resulting
equilibrium structure of wages is very diﬀerent. We discuss this issue further
in the Conclusion.

2.5

A Baseline Case

The model simplifies if the cost of posting a vacancy, , is trivial. The
cost of adjustment function estimated by Merz and Yashiv (2007) provides
empirical support for the relevance of this case. In the notation of this
model, they estimate a cost of recruiting and hiring function of the form
( + 0 1 ) , which is a special case of that specified above since the hire
rate is linear in the number of vacancies posted. Although the estimates
of the non-linear component play a large role in explaining the dynamics of
factor adjustment as well as the ability of their model to explain firm market
values, their point estimate of the linear component is slightly negative and
statistically insignificant. Hence, the restriction  = 0 is consistent with
their findings. Furthermore, this evidence that labor adjustment costs are
primarily processing and training costs rather then those associated with
advertising seems to be consistent with everyday experience.

Rank Preserving Equilibria
Comparative Dynamics

A wage policy function (; ) that is strictly increasing in  for every state
of the market , is said to be rank-preserving in the sense that the rank
of a firm’s wage in the wage oﬀer distribution is the same as its rank in
the productivity distribution in every market state. As workers voluntarily
move only from worse to better paying firms, a market equilibrium is rankpreserving in the sense of Moscarini and Postel-Vinay if the equilibrium wage
policy function is rank preserving.
We first establish that () is increasing in ; i.e. higher productivity
firms enjoy higher employee values.
Proposition 1 The value of an employee (; ) is unique, continuous and
increasing in  for every .
Proof. Any solution (; ) to (7) is a fixed point of the contraction

where  denotes the expectation with respect to information available at

these properties,  maps the space of bounded, continuous and increasing
functions in . Hence a fixed point of the map exists, is unique and has the
property stated.
Anticipating that higher productivity firms have a greater marginal willingness to pay for a lower quit rate, we focus on rank-preserving equilibria
where (; ) is indeed increasing in  Given higher productivity firms pay
higher wages, it is immediate that lifetime values  (; ) are also increasing in  As both () and  () are increasing in  the wage equation (6)
confirms that the equilibrium wage () increases with 

A rank-preserving equilibrium yields the following simplification: that

firms with type no greater than  and also the fraction of job oﬀers which

function (; ) =  (; ) −  () equations (1) and (2) imply:

Aggregation

From now on we restrict attention to optimal wage policy functions which are
rank-preserving and confirm the existence and uniqueness of such a policy
as part of the characterization of the equilibrium. This section aggregates
across the wage oﬀer and hiring strategies of firms and so identifies job oﬀer
propensities () b(; ) consistent with a rank-preserving equilibrium.
Recall that each firm employs an integer number of workers. Suppose at
date , the firm of rank  has ( ) employees. In the limiting
R case of a
continuum of firms and by the law of large numbers,  () = 0 ( )

Suppose now in state  =  at date  firm ( ; ) adopts optimal recruitment rule  = (; ) where  = ∗ (()) Recall that to hire at this
expected rate, the matching process requires the firm posts  ( ; ) vacancies where () ( (; )) =  Thus optimal vacancy posting implies
() ( ; ) =

(; )

Definition of Equilibrium

In principle the aggregate state variable  at time  is the distribution of
firm sizes for each type  which we previously denoted  ( ) For each
firm ( ; ) however, both the wage strategy (; ) and recruitment eﬀort
strategy (; ) are firm size independent. In what follows we show  () is
a suﬃcient statistic for the market state.
Fix a rank  ∈ [0 1] For any such , a rank preserving equilibrium implies
 () evolves over time according to the following diﬀerential equation:

where the dot refers to the time derivative   and unemployment  =
1 −  (1) The inflow includes those unemployed who are hired at a firm no
greater than  and those employed at a firm with productivity 0   which
receives shock  ≤  The outflow contains those whose job is destroyed, who
leave to start-up a firm, whose employer enjoys a favorable productivity shock
and employees who receive a more favorable outside oﬀer (and so quit). We
now formally define equilibrium where  =  () is the aggregate state variable. We use the following standard notation: that as  evolves according
to the above deterministic process, the wage policy function  = (; ())
implies the wage at rank  evolves according to  () = (;  )
Definition Given state  = () a stationary rank preserving equilibrium is
a wage policy function (; ()) and hire rate policy (; ()) that
satisfy
(; ) =  + ()b(; )(; )

(16)

The following mild regularity conditions guarantee that a unique solution
exists to the system of ordinary diﬀerential equation for every specification
of initial conditions:
Assumption 1: ∗ () is Lipschitz continuous.6
To identify an upper bound for (; ) suppose in the rip-oﬀ strategy that
() = 0 (its employees never quit) and  = 1  = 0 so that its productivity
is always  The corresponding maximal payoﬀ  is then defined by equation
(17) below. To guarantee existence of an equilibrium, we require the following
restriction on fundamentals.
Assumption 2: A positive solution for  exists to

(17)

Assumption 2 implies the following upper bound on .
Proposition 3 In any stationary rank-preserving equilibrium, the recruitment rate () is bounded above by the eﬀective rate of time discount, i.e.,
(; )   +  +  for all ( ).
Proof. By the Envelope Theorem, the RHS of equation (17) is an increasing,
convex function of  with slope ∗ ()( +  + ) As the RHS is strictly
positive at  = 0 then, given a positive solution exists for  it implies
∗ ()   +  +  The proposition then follows as ( ) ≤  for all   and
∗ () is an increasing function.
6

Thus, () increasing and strictly convex with the properties (0) = 0 (0) = 0 are
suﬃcient conditions.

Homogenous Firms

Although it is true that the market state  () is of infinite dimension in
the general case, it need not be so in practice. In this section we fully
characterize the unique recursive rank-preserving equilibrium in the limiting
case of homogenous firms.
In the homogeneous firm case we suppose () is (arbitrarily close to)  for
all  By construction, each firm  is indiﬀerent to using the rip-oﬀ strategy.
As the rip-oﬀ strategy does not depend on  - the firm posts wage  = 
indefinitely - then (; ) cannot depend on  in the limiting homogenous
firm case. Let  = (;  ) denote the value of an employee in each firm
in the limiting case. Optimal recruitment eﬀort  = ∗ ( ) is thus also
independent of . The definition of equilibrium then implies the job oﬀer
arrival rate reduces to

Thus conditional on equilibrium hiring intensity ∗ ( ) the job oﬀer arrival
rate only depends on  () through the implied unemployment level  =
1− (1) Given the limiting case of homogenous firms, we can further restrict
the aggregate state vector to  =  , which is a scalar. Employee value
 = ( ) and aggregate unemployment  evolve according to the pair of
autonomous diﬀerential equations:

It is well known that a unique continuous solution exists to this equation for
all  ∈ [0 1] if and only if the ODE system composed of (19) and (20) has a
unique steady state solution and the steady state is a saddle point. Indeed,
the branch of the saddle path that converges to the steady state for every
initial value of aggregate unemployment is the equilibrium value of a match
function. Below we prove that these necessary and suﬃcient conditions hold.

Any steady state solution is the ( ) pair defined by the pair of equations
 − ( + ) = −∗ () ln 

(21)

( +  +  − ∗ () ln  )  =  −  + max { − ()}

(22)

≥0

We first show there exists a single solution pair ( ) to these equations.
·

Equation (21) describes the  = 0 locus drawn in Figure 1 below. The

LHS of (21) is zero at  = +
 1 and decreases at the constant rate
 +  For any   0 the RHS is zero at  = 0 1 is positive and strictly
concave in  for  ∈ (0 1) Hence a unique, positive value of  strictly less
than ( + ) exists for every positive value of . As ∗ () is an increasing
function, it follows that  decreases as  increases with limiting properties
 → ( + ) as  → 0 and  → 0 as  → ∞
·
Equation (22) describes the  = 0 locus in Figure 1. The RHS does not
depend on  is strictly positive at  = 0 and, for  ∈ [0 ] the Envelope
Theorem implies it is a strictly increasing function of  with slope ∗ () 
 +  +  [Proposition 3]. The LHS is instead zero at  = 0 and is a strictly
increasing function of  with slope strictly greater than  +  +  Thus if
a solution exists to equation (22) it must be unique. Note further that at
 = 1 the unique solution is  =  As the LHS is decreasing in  it follows
that a solution for  ∈ [0 ] exists for all  ∈ [0 1] where  increases as 
increases with limiting properties  → 0 as  → 0 and  =  at  = 1
Continuity now implies a unique steady state solution for the pair ( )
exists and steady state  ∈ [0 ( + )]
The dynamics implied by the ODE system composed of (20) and (19) are
illustrated by its phase diagram portrayed in Figure 1. The intersection of
the two singular curves is a saddle point that attracts a unique converging
saddle path from any initial value of . Finally, because the growth rate in 
on the unstable path above the saddle path must eventually exceed the rate
of interest, while the unstable path below the steady state ultimately yields
zero  (which contradicts optimal firm behavior) the stable path represents
the only Markov equilibrium.
Proposition 4 A unique stationary rank-preserving equilibrium exists in the
limiting case of equally productive firms. Further equilibrium () increases
with unemployment.
19

Figure 1: Phase Diagram

20

The phase diagram and the equilibrium adjustment path have a natural
interpretation as a dynamic supply and demand model for match formation.
Of course, the value of an employee  is the relevant price. A higher employee
value induces greater recruiting eﬀort which yields greater utilization of the
available labor force by reducing unemployment duration, a relationship rep·

resented by the downward sloping  = 0 singular (supply) curve. However,
the (demand) price  increases at the margin with  along the ̇ = 0 curve
because lifetime wages decrease with aggregate unemployment. Along the
optimal adjustment path, the price adjusts in response to "excess demand"
to bring the supply and demand prices into balance.
Note that any common and unanticipated positive shock to the productivity of a match  shifts up the dynamic "demand" curve [the ̇ = 0 curve]
in Figure 1 but has no direct eﬀect on "supply." The result is an increase in
the steady state value of employment () and a decrease in unemployment
( ) as in the canonical search and matching model. Hence, the equilibrium
value of  jumps up initially and then adjusts slowly downward along the
path converging to the new steady state value.
It is straightforward to back out equilibrium micro-behavior: the equilibrium wage paid by a rank  firm is
¶
µ
 + ()
∗
(; ) =  +  () ln

with  = () This expression confirms that () is indeed rank preserving,
where (0;  ) =  is the lowest wage paid. Although equilibrium ( ) is
independent of () this is not the case for the induced wage dispersion ()
Thus even at steady state  wage dispersion (and quit turnover) dynamics
are non-trivial. Furthermore there are additional composition eﬀects if  ()
lies away from its steady state.
The equilibrium quit rate is
( (;  ); ) = −∗ () ln[ + ()]
which is decreasing in  being −∗ () ln  at  = 0 (the bottom rank firm)
and zero at  = 1. Note a firm’s equilibrium quit rate depends directly on the
level of unemployment. This occurs as firms are more likely to recruit from
the pool of unemployed workers the larger is that pool. As each quit costs
the firm  in continuation payoﬀ, each firm is thus better oﬀ with higher
unemployment as competing firms are then less likely to poach one of its
21

employees. Indeed it is this poaching externality which explains why, outside
of steady state, equilibrium () is increasing in  .
Wage dispersion arises as hiring is costly and firms oﬀer diﬀerent wages
to reduce their employee quit rates. As in BM, the wages oﬀered are ranked
by productivity  where higher ranked firms pay higher wages and enjoy
lower quit rates. Unlike BM, however, there is no simple correlation between
wages and firm size. Here instead high rank  firms enjoy high expected
growth rates equal to ∗ () [1 + ln[ + ()]] Thus a firm’s growth rate is
independent of its size  depending only on its productivity rank  within the
set of all competing firms, the level of unemployment, where  = ( ) and on
the distribution of firm sizes () The expected growth rate of employment
depends only on whether or not  exceeds its steady state value. Across
surviving firms, firms with  satisfying  + ()  1 ' 037 have positive
expected growth rates, while lower rank firms have negative growth rates.
Current firm size ( ) thus evolves according to a geometric Markov process
where currently large firms will typically have existed for a longer time and
enjoyed higher than average growth rates.

Heterogeneous Firms

This section now generalizes the analysis to a finite number of firm types.
Let  represent the productivity of firms of type  = 1  ; i.e. () = 
for all  ∈ (−1   ] ⊆ [0 1] where the set (−1   ] represents the set of
firms of type  and 0 = 0  = 1. As the value of an employee is the
same for all firms of the same type, let  () = (; ) for  ∈ (−1   ],
 = 1 2 , denote the value of an employee in type  firms in aggregate state
 v =(1  2    ) denotes the corresponding vector of employee values. Let
 = ( ) denote the number of workers employed in firms of type  or less
and N =(1  2    ) denotes the corresponding vector. Note unemployc1 (−1 ) describes the probability

c
Γ1 ( ) =  so that the set { } describe the probability distribution of type
 shocks. For simplicity, suppose all new start-ups have initial productivity
 =  .
With finite types, we describe equilibrium where  = N describes the

Proof. To complete the proof, we need only show that  maps the set of
Lipschitz continuous functions that are bounded in supnorm into itself. We
consider the bound  defined by Assumption 2 and  defined by

Let kk = sup ∈F | | represent the supnorm. As  (v  N ) ≤ (v  N )

() (N0 ) ≤  and () (N0 ) ≤   1
Now for  =  the law of motion for  reduces to

Conclusion.

We have shown the introduction of a hiring margin into the matching framework with on-the-job search yields a surprisingly rich and tractable equilibrium framework. We have fully characterized and established the existence
of rank-preserving equilibria in dynamic, non-steady state economies. The
environment considered is particularly rich. There is turnover of firms with
innovative start-up companies replacing existing firms which suﬀer firm destruction shocks. There is quit turnover where, in equilibrium, workers quit
low productivity firms to take employment in high productivity firms. Even
with no precommitment by firms on future wages, equilibrium wage dispersion arises as higher productivity firms are willing to pay a higher wage to
reduce employee quit rates. Furthermore firm growth rates are size independent: high productivity firms pay higher wages, enjoy low quit rates, recruit
new employees with greater eﬀort and so enjoy a positive expected growth
rate. The converse is the case for low productivity firms. The structure
also allows for firm specific productivity shocks, so that previously successful
firms may ultimately decline should they receive an unfavorable productivity
draw.
The characterization of equilibrium is particularly simple in the limiting
case of equally productive firms. Even though the distribution of firm sizes
is infinitely dimensional, equilibrium aggregate behavior depends only on the
level of unemployment. A particularly useful insight is that the value of a
firm is increasing in the level of unemployment. This occurs as, with higher
unemployment, firms are less likely to poach each others’ employees. As a
quit is costly to the firm (it is costly to hire a replacement), this poaching
externality implies an employee is more valuable (more likely to stay) as
unemployment increases. As greater employee value implies firms respond
by increasing recruitment eﬀort, the equilibrium dynamics of the economy
are intrinsically stable.
This new rich and tractable framework opens up several important directions for future research. The equally productive firms case is important as
equilibrium dichotomizes into (i) macroeconomic behavior where, depending
only on the level of unemployment  equilibrium determines gross job creation rates and (ii) microeconomic behavior where wages and quit turnover
26

at the firm level depends on a firm fixed eﬀect  the collective recruitment
eﬀort of firms (determined in the macroequilibrium) and the distribution of
firm sizes which itself evolves endogenously over time. Given the Markov
structure of the model, it is clear the model will generalize to a framework
where aggregate productivity  and job destruction parameter  evolve according to a stochastic Markov process. The extension is interesting not only
because firms use optimal wage setting strategies, rather than Nash bargaining, but also because the insights of Coles and Moghaddasi (2011) suggest
this framework will fit the business cycle volatility and persistence data as
described in Shimer (2005). Indeed the model will automatically generate
procyclical quit turnover: high aggregate productivity  will increase firm
hiring rates, thus increasing worker quits from the lower end of the type xdistribution. Furthermore periods of high unemployment will have lower quit
rates as newly available jobs are more likely to be filled by the unemployed.
An important distinction between this paper and the BM approach is
that in the latter framework the wage had to do two jobs: wages were used
both to attract new employees and to retain existing employees. Here instead
the hiring margin is fully targeted by recruitment strategy, leaving wages to
target only the quit margin. The resulting equilibrium wage structure is different. Preliminary work suggests the properties of the wage oﬀer density are
more akin to the data. Furthermore the employment weighted distribution
of wages, a distribution which is only stationary in the steady state, can be
quite complex.
The equilibrium wage structure considered here relies on a reputation
eﬀect: that if the firm ever announces a low wage, its employees forever
anticipate the rip-oﬀ wage  =  in the future. It is well known in infinitely
repeated games that allowing reputation eﬀects can support a multiplicity
of equilibria. The same is true here. The key is that if employees forever
expect wage  =  in the future, then paying a higher wage for an instant
  0 has (almost) no eﬀect on turnover. Thus given those beliefs it is
optimal simply to pay  =  An alternative construction, then, is that the
high wage strategy ( ; ) may instead yield strictly greater profit than
the rip-oﬀ strategy. The wage path () remains credible as any deviation is
punished by employee expectations  =  in the entire future (and is thus less
profitable).7 The approach taken here, however, is not only more tractable
(it describes a Markovian wage process), we believe it is the more persuasive
7

we are grateful to Ludo Vischers for pointing out this possibility

27

case for two reasons.
First for the equal productivity case, the alternative approach implies a
firm exists with ∗  0 which makes strictly greater profit than does firm
 = 0 (which pays  = ) Firm  = 0 would clearly like to adopt the wage
policy (∗ ; ) as this yields greater profit. Further its employees would
also be better oﬀ if its firm did adopt this wage policy (which is diﬀerent
to, and thus more generous than the rip-oﬀ strategy). The only reason the
firm does not do this, however, is because its employees insist on expecting
wage  =  in the entire future. Although consistent with subgame perfect
behavior, this outcome does not seem compelling: it seems more reasonable
that the firm and its employees should coordinate (renegotiate) to the jointly
preferred ∗ wage policy. Note that the equilibrium structure above rules out
jointly preferred wage policies - workers strictly prefer a higher  wage policy
(; ) while firms do not. All firms, being indiﬀerent to the same rip-oﬀ
strategy, enjoy the same equilibrium payoﬀ.
Second, a diﬀerent approach is to introduce asymmetric information: that
firms know their productivity () but workers only observe a history of
wages paid. Indeed there is a large wage bargaining literature based on
this assumption. Preliminary work (with wage setting by firms) identifies a
fully revealing equilibrium where higher productivity firms announce strictly
higher wages and so enjoy strictly lower employee quit rates. Further in
the limit as productivity dispersion disappears, each firm  makes the same
expected profit. This limiting equilibrium (with asymmetric information)
has properties very similar to the one identified above.
