The Unique Minimum State Variable RE Solution is E-Stable in
All Well Formulated Linear Models

NBER Working Paper No. 9960
September 2003
JEL No. E00, C6, B4
ABSTRACT
This paper explores the relationship between the closely linked concepts of E-stability and leastsquares learnability, featured in recent work by Evans and Honkapohja (1999, 2001), and the
minimum-state-variable (MSV) solution defined by McCallum (1983) and used by many researchers
for rational expectations (RE) analysis. It is shown that the MSV solution, which is unique by
construction, is E-stable--and therefore LS learnable when nonexplosive--in all linear RE models
that satisfy conditions for being "well formulated." The latter property involves two requirements.
The first is that values of the model's parameters are restricted so as to avoid any infinite
discontinuity, of the steady state values of endogenous variables, in response to small changes in
these parameters. (It is expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of a matrix that is the sum of those
attached to the one-period-ahead and one-period-lagged values of the endogenous variables in a
first-order vector formulation of the model.) The second, which is needed infrequently, is that the
parameters are restricted to prevent any infinite discontinuities in the MSV response coefficients.

1. Introduction
Much recent research in economics, especially in monetary economics, has focused
on issues involving analytical indeterminacy—multiplicity of stable rational expectations
solutions—often in dynamic general equilibrium models based on optimizing behavior by
individual agents.1 In this context, the recent appearance of major publications by Evans and
Honkapohja (1999, 2001) has stimulated new interest in the relationship between the linked
concepts of E-stability and least-squares learnability, featured in their work,2 and the
minimum-state-variable solution concept promoted by McCallum (1983, 1999), which
identifies a unique rational expectations solution in all linear models.3 In the present paper it
will be argued that the connection is much tighter, at least for linear models, than is generally
believed. Indeed, it will be shown that, for all linear models (within a very wide class) that
satisfy the property of being well formulated, the unique minimum-state-variable (MSV)
solution is E-stable and therefore least-squares (LS) learnable.4 There are a few existing
examples of MSV solutions that are not E-stable, which have been mentioned and given
some emphasis by Evans and Honkapohja (1992, 2001). But these examples pertain to
models that are not plausible economically for the relevant range of parameter values;
restrictions on these parameters that are necessary for the models to be well formulated have
the effect of ruling out the range that permits E-instability. Thus the paper’s results provide a
newly developed reason for believing that the MSV solution will generally be the one that is
1

In monetary economics such issues include indeterminacy under inflation forecast targeting (Woodford, 1994;
Bernanke and Woodford, 1997; King, 2000), deflationary traps (Benhabib, Schmitt-Grohe, and Uribe, 2001),
the fiscal theory of the price level (Sims, 1994; Woodford, 1995; Cochrane, 1998; Kotcherlakota and Phelan,
1999; McCallum, 2001), and the validity of the “Taylor Principle” (Woodford, 2002). For a useful overview of
several related points, see Bullard and Mitra (2002).

Evans and Honkapohja (1999) is an extensive survey article in the Taylor-Woodford Handbook of Macroeconomics, whereas their (2001) is an ambitious treatise published by Princeton University Press.

The point that the MSV solution is unique by construction is reviewed in Section 2.

economically relevant. In this sense, the paper amounts to a strong, albeit delayed, response
to Lucas’s (1986, p. S419) observation that “it is unclear what the behavioral rationale for
this principle [i.e., general adoption of the MSV solution] is.” In particular, the paper shows
that the learnability rationale suggested in Lucas’s paper provides considerable support for
the MSV solution concept.5
In exploring the featured relationship, it is necessary to be unambiguous about the
concept of a MSV solution. Throughout that term will be used to designate the unique
solution—unique by construction—described in McCallum (1983, 1999). This is the way
that the term was used by Evans (1986, 1989) and Evans and Honkapohja (1992) but differs
from the terminology in the latter’s more recent publications (1999, p. 496; 2001, p. 194),
which permits multiple solutions to be given the MSV adjective. Either terminology could
be used, of course, but the one adopted here is more appropriate for the issue at hand. In
particular, it is more convenient (as well as more aesthetically pleasing) to refer to the
pertinent solution as “the MSV solution” rather than as “the MSV solution that is singled out
by the procedure defined by McCallum (1983, 1999).”
The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, the concepts of E-stability, LS
learnability, and MSV solutions are briefly reviewed. Then in Section 3 the main existing
example of a linear model in which the MSV solution is not E-stable is examined, and it is
argued that the range of parameter values necessary for this result renders the model
implausible economically. That argument is rather ad hoc in nature, however, so Section 4
proposes some general requirements for a model to be regarded as well formulated.

4

The specific requirement for being well formulated is explained below. E-stability implies LS learnability in
most cases, but the implication is not entirely general, especially when the solution is explosive.
5
The paper does not present any claims, however, concerning the presence or absence of E-stability for nonMSV solutions.

2

Basically, these requirements rule out parameter configurations that permit infinite
discontinuities in the model’s properties. The first two applications of these requirements are
developed in Section 5. There it is shown that, for two leading univariate models featured by
Evans and Honkapohja (1999, 2001), the proposed requirements for being well formulated
suffice to guarantee that the MSV solution is E-stable. Then Section 6 turns to multivariate
models and develops an extension of the argument that applies quite generally to linear RE
models. Finally, Section 7 provides a brief summary and conclusion.
2. Concepts and Issues
It will be useful to begin with a short review of E-stability, LS learnability, and MSV
solutions. Evans (1985, 1986), building upon a result of DeCanio (1979), developed iterative
E-stability as a selection criterion for RE models with multiple solutions.6 The basic
presumption is that individual agents will not be endowed with perfect knowledge of the
economic system’s structure, so it must be considered whether plausible correction
mechanisms are convergent. Consider the example model:
(1)

yt = α + aEtyt+1 + cyt-1 + ut,

where ut = ρut-1 + εt with ρ< 1 and εt being white noise.7 With this specification, the usual
“fundamentals” RE solution will be of the form
(2)

yt = φ0 + φ1yt-1 + φ2ut,

but suppose that agents do not “initially” know the exact values of the φj parameters. If at
any date t the agents’ prevailing belief is that their values are φ0(n), φ1(n), and φ2(n)—where
n indexes iterations—so that the perceived law of motion (PLM) is

6

The emphasis is usually on cases with multiple solutions that are dynamically stable (i.e., non-explosive)
since explicit or implicit transversality conditions will often rule out explosive paths as solutions.
7
Evans and Honkapohja (1999, 2001) use the symbols β and δ instead of a and c.

3

(3)

yt = φ0(n) + φ1(n)yt-1 + φ2(n)ut,

then the implied unbiased expectation of yt+1 will be
(4)

φ0(n) + φ1(n)yt + φ2(n)ρut.

Using this last expression in place of Etyt+1 in (1)—which implies that we have temporarily
abandoned RE—gives
(5)

yt = α + a[φ0(n) + φ1(n)yt + φ2(n)ρut] + cyt-1 + ut

or, rearranging,
(6)

yt = [1−aφ1(n)]-1 [α + aφ0(n) + aφ2(n)ρut + cyt-1] + ut

as the system’s actual law of motion (ALM). Now imagine a sequence of iterations from the
PLM to the ALM. Writing the left-hand side of (6) in the form (3) for iteration n+1 then
implies that
(7a)

φ0(n+1) = [1 − aφ1(n)]-1[α + aφ0(n)]

(7b)

φ1(n+1) = [1 − aφ1(n)]-1c

(7c)

φ2(n+1) = [1 − aφ1(n)]-1[aφ2(n)ρ + 1].

The issue, then, is whether iterations defined by (7) are such that the φj(n) converge to the φj
values in an expression of form (2) as n → ∞ . If they do, then that solution (2) is said to be
iteratively E-stable. Evans (1986) found that in several prominent and controversial
examples the MSV solution—to be discussed shortly—is iteratively E-stable.
On the basis of results by Marcet and Sargent (1989), Evans (1989) and Evans and
Honkapohja (1992) switched attention to E-stability without the “iterative” qualification,
defined as follows. Conversion of equations (7) to a continuous form, appropriate as the

4

iteration interval approaches zero,8 results in
(8a)

dφ0(n)/dn = [1 − aφ1(n)]-1[α + a φ0(n)] − φ0(n)

(8b)

dφ1(n)/dn = [1 − aφ1(n)]-1c − φ1(n)

(8c)

dφ2(n)/dn = [1 − aφ1(n)]-1[a φ2(n)ρ + 1] − φ2(n).

If the differential equation system (8) is such that φj(n) → φj for all j, the solution (2) is Estable.9 An important feature of this continuous version of the iterative process is that it is
intimately related to an adaptive learning process that is modeled as taking place in real
time.10 11 For most models of interest, that is, values of parameters analogous to the φj in (2)
that are estimated by LS regressions on the basis of data from periods t−1, t−2, …, 1 and
used to form expectations in period t, will converge to the actual values in (2) as time passes
if equations (8) converge to those values and (2) is dynamically stable (non-explosive). Also,
such convergence will not occur if equations (8) do not converge. Thus E-stability and LS
learnability typically go hand in hand. This result, which is discussed extensively by Evans
and Honkapohja (1999, 2001), is useful because it is technically much easier, in many cases,
to establish E-stability than to establish LS learnability. The latter concept is arguably the
more important, in a fundamental sense, as learnability of some type might be regarded as a
necessary condition for the relevance of a RE equilibrium.12
To this point the discussion of equation (1) has presumed that expectations are not
8

There is also a positive speed-of-adjustment coefficient in each of equations (8), but its magnitude is irrelevant
for the convergence issue so is usually (as here) set equal to 1. See, e.g., Evans (1989, p. 299).
9
Throughout the paper we shall be discussing weak E-stability, rather than the more demanding concept of
strong E-stability. For the distinction, see footnote 27 below and E&H (2001, pp. 41-42).
10
The E-stability process is itself conceived of as taking place in notional time (meta time).
11
An influential early analysis regarding learning of RE solutions was provided by Bray (1982).
12
In this regard, note that the LS learning process assumes that (i) agents are collecting an ever-increasing
number of observations on all relevant variables while (ii) the structure is remaining unchanged. Furthermore,
(iii) the agents are estimating the relevant unknown parameters with an appropriate estimator in (iv) a properly
specified model. Thus if a proposed RE solution is not learnable by the process in question, it would seem
implausible that it could prevail in practice.

5

formed rationally, i.e., that Etyt+1 in (1) has been replaced with some approximation such as
(4). Now we return to the RE assumption and consider the nature of the MSV solution to
model (1). One requirement of the MSV solution is that it be real and linear. Another is that
it not include any extraneous state variables, so for model (1) it will be of form (2). That
form implies that Etyt+1 = φ0 + φ1(φ0 + φ1yt-1 + φ2ut) + φ2 ρut so substitution of the latter and
(2) into (1) implies that the undetermined coefficients, the φjs, must be real and satisfy the
following equations:
(9a)

φ0 = α + aφ0 + aφ1φ0

(9b)

φ1 = a φ12 + c

(9c)

φ2 = aφ1φ2 + aρφ2 + 1.

Clearly, the second of these yields two potential values for φ1, namely, [1 ± 1 − 4ac ]/2a.
These expressions should be considered as two different functions of a and c, which therefore
define two different RE solutions. But the MSV solution is unambiguously provided by use
of the φ1 function with the minus sign, for that is the one that implies φ1 = 0 in the special
case in which c = 0. (In this case yt-1 does not appear in the model so φ1 must equal zero to
avoid inclusion of an extraneous state variable in the solution.) Then with φ1 uniquely
determined, the other two φj values are given unambiguously by the remaining two equations
in (9).13 For more general models, the MSV solution is found in an analogous manner:
different solutions correspond to different groupings of eigenvalues and eigenvectors relating
to matrix counterparts of the quadratic equation (9b).14 The grouping is chosen that excludes
extraneous state variables from the solution in a special case, namely, one that includes no
13

This discussion presumes that the roots to the quadratic are real. If they are complex, then by definition the
MSV solution does not exist. For some parameter values this will be the case.

6

predetermined variables in the model’s structure.
For the system of our example (1), then, the issue of principal interest is whether the
MSV solution possesses E-stability, i.e., whether the differential equations (8) are locally
stable at the MSV values for the φj. Necessary and sufficient conditions for E-stability of this
system are given by Evans and Honkapohja (2001, p. 202) as follows: a(1−aφ1)-1 < 1,
ca(1− aφ1)-2 < 1, ρa(1− aφ1)-1 < 1. These will be utilized below.
3. Questionable Example15
In various places, Evans and Honkapohja (henceforth, E&H) have indicated that
MSV solutions may or may not have the property of E-stability (and LS learnability). Here
the agenda is to describe and reconsider the main example put forth by E&H (1992, pp. 9-10;
1999, pp. 496-7; 2001, p. 197) as representing a case in which the MSV solution is not Estable. The relevant model’s reduced form can be written as
(10)

yt = α + γEt-1yt + ζEt-1yt+1 + δyt-1 + εt,

with δ ≠ 0, ζ ≠ 0, and εt white noise. The MSV solution will be of the form
(11)

yt = φ0 + φ1yt-1 + φ2 εt,

and φ1 will be determined by a quadratic equation with the MSV solution given by the φ1 root
that equals zero when δ = 0. The other root gives a non-MSV “bubble” solution and there
are also bubble solutions of a form that includes additional terms involving yt-2 and εt-1 on the
right-hand side of (11).
Necessary conditions for E-stability of a solution of form (11) are (E&H, 1992, p. 6)
(12)

14
15

γ + ζ − 1 + ζφ1 < 0 and γ − 1 + 2ζφ1 < 0.

See McCallum (1983, pp. 165-6; 1999, eqns. (21)-(26)).
Sections 3 and 4 are based on McCallum (2002).

7

On the basis of these, E&H (1992, pp. 9-10) show that the non-MSV solution of form (11) is
E-stable, and the MSV solution is E-unstable, when γ = −ζ > 1 and δ > 0. Also, on p. 5 they
show that the bubble solutions with additional terms are E-stable if γ > 1, δζ > 0, and ζ < 0.
If such parameter values were economically sensible, these results would constitute explicit
counter-examples to my suggestion that MSV solutions are invariably E-stable.
Let us, however, reconsider the economic model that E&H (1992) use to motivate the
reduced form equation (10). It is a log-linear “model of aggregate demand and supply with
wealth effects in aggregate demand, money demand, and aggregate supply” (1992, p. 9).
Letting yt, mt, and pt be the logs of output, money, and the price level with it a nominal
interest rate, E&H write:16
(13a) yt = −g1(it − Et-1(pt+1 − pt)) + g2(mt − pt) + v1t
(13b) yt = f(mt − pt) + v2t
(13c) mt − pt = yt − a1it + a2(mt − pt) + v3t
(13d) mt = d pt-1 + v4t.
The fourth equation “is a monetary policy reaction function….” (1992, p. 9). Solving these
four equations for the reduced form expression for pt gives
(14)

pt = d pt-1 + h Et-1(pt − pt+1) + ut

with h = g1[f−g2 + g1(a2+f − 1)a1-1]-1 and ut a linear combination of the (white noise) vit terms.
Consequently, the model is of form (10) with yt in the latter representing pt in the model and
with γ = h, ζ = −h, and δ = d.
It follows, then, that the condition γ = −ζ > 1 requires h > 1. In that regard, note first
that if real-balance terms are excluded, i.e., if g2 = f = a2 = 0, then h = − a1 is negative. Thus

8

sizeable real-balance effects are needed. Second, note that a2 should arguably be specified as
negative, not positive, since the latter would imply a money demand function with income
elasticity greater than 1.0, in contrast with most empirical estimates. But with a2 < 0, f would
have to be quite large to generate h > 1, if g2 > 0. Thus h > 1 seems highly implausible in the
context of an IS-LM model of the type utilized.
In addition, the condition δ > 0 implies d > 0 in (14d), implying that the money
supply is increased by the monetary authority when the price level is higher than average in
the previous period. That represents, at least arguably, a somewhat perverse form of policy
behavior.
An alternative way of interpreting the reduced-form equation (10), not mentioned by
E&H, is as a microeconomic supply-demand model. Suppose we have demand and supply
functions
(15a) qt = β0 + β1pt + β2Et-1(pt+1 − pt) + v1t
(15b)

qt = α0 + α1pt + α2Et-1pt + v2t

where the disturbance terms include effects of exogenous variables such as demanders’
income and the price of inputs to production. Here we presume that β1 < 0 and β2 > 0, to
reflect downward sloping demand with respect to the current price and a speculative demand
motive. Also, let α1 ≥ 0 and α2 ≥ 0 to reflect upward sloping supply with respective to
relevant prices. Then the reduced form is
(16)

pt = (α1 − β1)-1 [(β0 − α0) + β2 Et-1pt+1 − (α2 + β2) Et-1pt + v1t − v2t].

In terms of equation (10), this specification suggests ζ > 0, γ < 0, and δ = 0. But the first two
of these are just opposite in sign to the requirements for the E&H example. Furthermore, it is
16

It is my impression that E&H intend for all parameters in (13) to be interpreted as non-negative.

9

conceivable that pt-1 would appear instead of Et-1pt in the supply equation. But then its
coefficient in the reduced form would be negative, and therefore inconsistent with the δ > 0
assumption in the E&H case under discussion.
In sum, I would argue that the specification used most prominently by E&H, as an
example featuring the absence of E-stability for the MSV solution, is unappealing in terms of
basic economic theory. It will be recognized, however, that this argument of mine is quite
specific and rather ad hoc in nature. Some more general position is needed, so one will be
developed in the next section.
4. Requirements for Well Formulated Models
In this section I propose conditions necessary for important classes of linear models
to be well formulated. Consider first the single-variable specification (1), which is
reproduced here for convenience:
(17)

yt = α + aEtyt+1 + cyt-1 + ut,

where ut = ρut-1 + εt with εt white noise. Thus ut is an exogenous forcing variable with an
unconditional mean of zero. Applying the unconditional expectation operator to (17) yields
(18)

E yt = α + aEyt+1 + cEyt-1 + 0.

If yt is covariance stationary, we then have17
(19)

E yt = α / [1− (a + c)].

But from the latter, it is clear that as a + c approaches 1.0 from above, the unconditional
mean of yt approaches −∞ (assuming without loss of generality that α > 0), whereas if a + c
approaches 1.0 from below, the unconditional mean approaches +∞. Thus there is an infinite
discontinuity at a + c = 1.0. This implies that a tiny change in a + c could alter the average

10

(i.e., steady state) value Eyt from an arbitrarily large positive number to an arbitrarily large
negative number. Such a property seems highly implausible and therefore unacceptable for a
well-formulated model.18
In light of the preceding observations, my contention is that, to be considered well
formulated, the model at hand needs to include a restriction on its admissible parameter
values that rules out a + c = 1, and yet admits a large open set of values that includes (a, c) =
(0, 0). In the case at hand, the appropriate restriction is a + c < 1. Of course, a + c > 1 would
serve just as well mathematically to avoid the infinite discontinuity, but it is clear that a + c <
1 is vastly more appropriate from an economic perspective since it includes the region around
(0, 0). It should be clear, in addition, that the foregoing argument could be easily modified to
apply to yt processes that are trend stationary, rather than strictly (covariance) stationary.
Generalizing, suppose that yt in (17) is a m×1 vector of endogenous variables, so that
α is m×1 while a and c become m×m matrices A and C. Then the counterpart of 1 − (a + c)
> 0 is that the eigenvalues of [I − (A + C)] are all real and positive, which implies that the
eigenvalues of [A + C] all have real parts less than 1.0. That requirement is necessary for the
multivariate version of (17) to be well formulated.19 Note that, with A and C being real, it
implies that det[I − (A + C)] > 0.20
There is, however, a second type of infinite discontinuity that also needs to be ruled

17

Note that it is not being assumed that yt is necessarily covariance stationary. Instead an implication that
would hold, if it were, is being used to motivate the assumption that will be made subsequently.
18
If the model has been formulated in terms of percent or fractional deviations from some reference level (e.g.,
a deterministic steady state) so that there is no explicit constant term, the argument will still apply to the implicit
constant term, which will almost always be non-zero.
19
If some variables enter the model in a fashion that their solutions have unit roots, then the foregoing argument
based on unconditional expectations is not directly applicable. In such cases, however, the model can be written
entirely in terms of the differences of such variables and the argument applied to the revised system.
20
That the condition det[I − (A + C)] > 0 is not sufficient to make the model well formulated can be seen by
considering a case with diagonal (A + C) in which I − (A+C) has two negative diagonal entries.

11

out for model (17) to be well formulated. This type pertains to dynamic responses of yt to the
exogenous forcing variable ut. From (9c) we see that the response coefficient is φ2 = (1 − aφ1
− aρ)-1 so to rule out an infinite discontinuity the relevant condition is 1 − aφ1 − aρ > 0. Our
particular concern is with the MSV solution, regarding which we note that 1 − aφ1 = (1 + d)/2
is unambiguously positive. Consequently, adoption of the second WF condition 1 − aφ1 > aρ
implies that 1 > (1 − aφ1)-1aρ.
To state this second condition directly in terms of a, c, and ρ, we could write it as
(1+d)/2 > aρ. For that to fail, it would be required that d < 2aρ − 1. That would imply
1 − 4ac < 4a2ρ2 − 4aρ + 1, which could prevail only if a and ρ were both negative.21 In that
case the last inequality would imply −c > aρ2 − ρ or ρ > aρ2 + c. This could be ruled out for
all −1 < ρ < 0 if one were to require –1 < a + c, but that condition is more demanding than
the second WF condition specified above, which is what we have adopted.
It might be added parenthetically that an alternative way of describing this more
demanding version of the second condition is discussed in McCallum (1983, pp. 159-160)
under the title of “process consistency.” That term was introduced by Flood and Garber
(1980), who used the concept in their analysis of monetary reform after the German
hyperinflation of 1923, and was developed more fully by E&H (1992, pp. 10-11). A model
fails to be process consistent when the procedure of solving out expectational variables, by
iteration into the infinite future, is of dubious validity because the implied infinite series does
not converge. For model (17) to be process consistent for any ρ< 1, it must be the case

21

Clearly (1+d)/2 > aρ cannot fail unless a and ρ are of the same sign. Further, it is shown below that
(1 − aφ1)-1a < 1 when a > 0.

12

that at least one of the roots to (9b) exceeds 1.0 in absolute value.22 Clearly, the larger root in
absolute value is φ1( + ) = (1+d)/2a, so with a < 0, process inconsistency can occur only if
(1+d)/2a > −1. 23 The latter implies (1+d) < −2a or d < −(2a+1), or 1 − 4ac < 1 + 4a + 4a2.
Subtracting −1 from each side and dividing by 4a < 0 yields −c > 1 + a or −1 > a + c. Thus to
rule out process inconsistency, we would require a + c > −1 when a < 0. This, of course, is
the same condition as the one derived in the previous paragraph; it is a second requirement
for model (17) to be well formulated for all ρ  < 1 when a < 0, and is one of the sufficient
conditions but is not necessary. For multivariate applications, when R is specified to be a
stable matrix, the analogous requirement is that at least m of the roots of the system’s
characteristic equation—e.g., the eigenvalues of matrix M in Section 6 below—exceed 1.0 in
absolute value (i.e., in modulus). Adoption of this stronger requirement would rule out cases
known in the literature as “irregular” (Binder and Pesaran, 1995, p. 161).
Now let us consider a second model specification that, like (17), is emphasized by
E&H. It can be written as
(20)

yt = α + β0 Et-1yt + β1 Et-1yt+1 + δyt-1 + ut,

where, for simplicity, we take ut to be white noise.24 For this case, consider the conditional
expectation, Et-1yt:
(21)

Et-1yt = (1 − β0)-1 [α + β1 Et-1yt+1 + δyt-1].

Here it is clear that, for given (predetermined) values of Et-1yt+1, yt-1, and ut-1, the expectation
Et-1yt will pass through an infinite discontinuity at β0 = 1. Consequently, for basically the

= f –1, where f = (1−aφ1)-1a, so | φ1 | < 1 is the same condition as |f | > 1.

24

There is no particular need to go into the more general case in which ut is autoregressive, because generality
will be provided in Section 6 by a multivariate extension of model (17).

13

same reason as outlined above, β0 < 1 is necessary for the model to be well formulated. In
addition, β0 + β1 + δ < 1 also applies. The multivariate extension for the case in which yt is a
vector yields the requirements that the eigenvalues of [I −β0] and [ I − (β0 + β1 + δ)], where

β0, β1, and δ are m×m matrices, all have positive real parts.25
An application of these criteria to the questionable example of E&H (1992), featured
above in Section 3, is immediate. That example’s result, of a MSV solution that is not Estable, requires γ = h > 1. But, in the notation of (20), that condition implies β0 > 1, which is
incompatible with our requirement for models of form (20) to be well formulated. Thus the
questionable example is discredited on general grounds, in addition to the specific reasons
developed in Section 3. 26
5. Results for Two Leading Univariate Cases
The first result in support of the contention that the MSV solution is E-stable in all
well formulated (henceforth, WF) models will be briefly developed for the univariate version
of specification (20) with δ = 0. For this model, conditions for E-stability can be found by
reference to Figure 1, which is adapted from E&H (1999, p. 492; 2001, p. 191). In these two
references, it is derived and reported that the MSV solution is E-stable in regions I, V, and VI
but E-unstable in regions II, III, and IV. In regions I and VI, moreover, the MSV solution is
reported to be strongly E-stable whereas in V it is weakly E-stable.27 Reference to our
conditions for model (20) to be well formulated (with δ = 0) shows immediately that these
conditions obtain only for regions I and VI. Thus in this particular but prominent case, the
25

In fact, this type of condition is also applicable to model (17) when ρ ≠ 0. In that case, transforming the
disturbance into white noise by multiplying through by (1−ρL), where L is the lag operator, brings in a term
involving Et-1yt and leads to the condition 1+aρ > 0. That, however, is apparently not a useful restriction.
26
A second example of a MSV solution that is E-unstable is presented in E&H (1994, pp. 1089-1091). In this
case the model is not well formulated as it violates the requirement [ I − (β0 + β1 + δ)] > 0.

14

MSV solution is strongly E-stable if the parameter values are such that the model is well
formulated.
Now let us focus on the more important model of equation (17). E-stability regions,
as reported by E&H (2001, p. 203) under the assumption 0 ≤ ρ < 1, are shown in Figure 2. In
this case, the results reported by E&H indicate that the MSV solution is E-stable in regions I
and VII but E-unstable in region IV, while “both solutions [i.e., from both roots of (9b)] are
explosive or nonreal” elsewhere (E&H, 2001, p. 203).28 Specifically, solutions for φ1 are
complex-valued in regions III and VI, and both solutions imply explosive behavior in regions
II and V. As indicated above, the MSV solution is (with 0 ≤ ρ <1) well formulated in regions
I, V, and VII (being complex in VI). Thus for regions I and VII, the E&H version of Figure
2 supports the hypothesis that the MSV solution is E-stable in any well formulated model.
But what about region V? There the E-stability conditions are in fact met—see
below—although in the E&H graphical summary this region is not distinguished from VI
because in V the solutions are both dynamically unstable (explosive). But there seems to be
no compelling reason to ignore the MSV solution simply because it is explosive; it could be
accurately indicating what would happen if (e.g.) extremely unwise policy behavior were
imposed on the system at some point in time.29 For a discussion and rationalization of this
position, with a closely related example, see McCallum (1999). In any case we see that this

27

Strong E-stability occurs in cases in which local convergence to the MSV parameter values occurs even when
the function considered includes additional variables (excluded from the MSV specification).

Note that the MSV solution is the AR(1) solution that E&H (2001) refer to as “ the b− solution.” Related
univariate results, more general in some respects but without the stochastic forcing variable and developed in
terms of adaptive learnability rather than E-stability, have been developed by Gauthier (2003) and Desgranges
and Gauthier (2003). Also see Wenzelburger (2002), who suggests that some extension to nonlinear models
may be possible.
29
The same statement does not apply to region II, where the MSV solution is E-stable but explosive, because
there the model is not well formulated. This region illustrates that, though sufficient, the WF condition is not
necessary for E-stability.
28

15

specification, too, conforms to the proposition that MSV solutions are E-stable in all well
formulated models. It must be recognized that the usual presumption that E-stability implies
LS learnability does not carry over automatically in cases of dynamic instability (which E&H
refer to as nonstationarity). E&H (2001, pp. 219-220) indicate, nevertheless, that learnability
will prevail in the present case, provided an adjustment is made to permit the shock variance
to grow along with the yt values, when ut is white noise.
We wish to develop results for the more general case with ρ < 1, permitting
negative values, but let us proceed by first demonstrating algebraically that the E-stability
conditions are satisfied by the MSV solution to model (17) when 0 ≤ ρ < 1 and the WF
restriction a + c < 1 is imposed. Then we can go on to the case with −1 < ρ < 0 included.
The first task, then, is to show that if 1− (a + c) > 0, then f = (1−a φ1 )-1a < 1 where φ1 =
(1−d)/2a with d = 1 − 4ac . Note first that 1−a φ1 = (1 + d)/2 so (1−a φ1 )-1a = 2a/(1+d). For
a proof by contradiction, suppose that 2a/(1+d) ≥ 1. Then a > 0 and 2a−1 ≥ d. Since both
of its sides are positive, the latter implies 4a2 − 4a + 1 ≥ d2 = 1 − 4ac. But with a > 0 the last
inequality reduces to a − 1 ≥ −c or 0 ≥ 1− (a + c), which is the contradiction that proves f =
(1−a φ1 )-1a < 1. The latter is the first of the three E-stability conditions listed at the end of
Section 2 above. The second results from writing (1−a φ1 )-2a c = (1−a φ 1)-1a φ1 , which
follows because (1−a φ1 )-1c = φ1 .30 Since (1−a φ 1)-1aφ1 = (1−d)/(1+d), which is smaller than
1 for all d > 0, we have the desired inequality. Finally, with (1−a φ1 )-1a < 1 and ρ nonnegative, the third condition also holds.
But if ρ can be negative, which is entirely plausible, it is possible that a fairly large

16

negative ρ together with (1−a φ )-1a < −1 could lead to failure of the third condition. This
possibility can be eliminated, however, by adding the second WF requirement that 1 − aφ1 −
aρ > 0. As is shown in Section 4, 1 − aφ1 = (1 + d)/2 for the MSV solution so 1 − aφ1 > 0 and
the second WF requirement becomes identical to the third condition for E-stability.
Adoption of both WF requirements therefore assures satisfaction of all three of the E&H
conditions.
Parenthetically we note that if one were to require process consistency, then he would
be requiring that |f| < 1 so | φ1( + ) | > 1. Since E&H (2001, p. 203) report that both characteristic
roots have absolute values less than 1.0 in region VII, that entire region would be eliminated.
In sum, we have shown that in model (17) with ρ< 1, the MSV solution is E-stable
for all parameter values satisfying our WF conditions. It is this univariate model that will
provide a background for an extension of the results to more general multivariate cases.
6. Extension to Multivariate Models
To begin the extension to multivariate models, it will be convenient to consider the
specification treated by E&H (2001, p. 236-238) and McCallum (1983, pp. 164-166). With
yt denoting a m×1 vector of endogenous variables, the system is
(22)

yt = A Etyt+1 + C yt-1 + ut,

where ut = R ut-1 + εt, with R a stable m×m matrix and εt a white noise vector.31 Also, we
assume initially that A is nonsingular. That is a strong assumption, which renders the
formulation (22) highly inconvenient from a practical perspective, but the implied case
provides a useful precursor for the more general analysis that will follow.

30

The last expression is just a rearrangement of (9b).
A stable matrix has all its eigenvalues less than 1 in modulus. In (22), constant terms have been suppressed
for notational simplicity and A and C are of dimension m×m.

31

17

In this setting, with or without nonsingular A, the MSV solution will be of the form
(23)

yt = Ω yt-1 + Γ ut,

and the conditions for E-stability (see E&H 2001, p. 238) are that the eigenvalues of the
following three matrices all have real parts less than 1.0:
(24a) (I − AΩ)-1A
(24b) [(I − AΩ)-1C]′ ⊗ [(I − AΩ)-1A]
(24c) R′ ⊗ [(I − AΩ)-1A].
Our first objective is to show that these conditions are satisfied when Ω is obtained by the
MSV procedure, if the eigenvalues of A + C all have real parts less than 1.0 and our second
WF requirement holds. Because the eigenvalues of the Kronecker product of two matrices
are the products of the eigenvalues of these matrices (E&H, 2001, p. 116), we shall
concentrate first on the m×m matrix [(I − AΩ)-1A], which we now denote as F.32
From McCallum (1983, pp. 164-166) we have that the MSV expression for Ω is
(25)

Ω = − P22-1 P21,

where the Pij are submatrices of P, with P-1 defined as the matrix of (right) eigenvectors of
the 2m×2m matrix M (assumed diagonalizable) in expression (26) below, which is a firstorder way of writing the matrix quadratic equation AΩ2 − Ω + C = 0:33

Since M = P-1ΛP, with Λ a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of M on its diagonal, we can
premultiply (26) by P to obtain

32

The invertibility of (I − AΩ) will be discussed below.
This quadratic equation is implied by undetermined-coefficient implications of the model, analogous to (9b).
There are, of course, many other solutions besides (25) to the quadratic for Ω.

Here Λ1 and Λ 2 include the eigenvalues of M, with the MSV solution being selected by
ordering the eigenvalues so that Λ1 includes those that approach 0 as C approaches 0. (This
ordering implies that the eigenvalues in Λ 2 approach the eigenvalues of A-1 as C goes to 0;
see McCallum (1983, pp. 165-166).) Since PM = ΛP, we have that −P22A-1C = Λ2P21 or P21
= − Λ2-1P22A-1C, so from (25) we obtain the explicit expression
(28)

Ω = P22-1Λ2-1 P22 A-1C,

which illustrates that Ω approaches 0 as C approaches 0.34 (Note that Λ2 approaches A-1 so
the product P22-1Λ2-1 P22 A-1 approaches a finite nonzero matrix.)
To show that the eigenvalues of F = [(I – AΩ)-1A] and Ω meet conditions (24), I will
draw on some results of Binder and Pesaran (B&P, 1995). For the moment, assume that A
and C commute, i.e., AC = CA. Then A and C are diagonalized by the same matrix, and so
too are both Ω and F as a consequence of their definitions. Thus the eigenvalues of F, now
denoted λF, each satisfy λF = (1 − λAλΩ)-1λA, as shown by B&P (1995, pp. 157-8). But then
the crucial condition (1 − λAλΩ)-1λA < 1 is entirely analogous to the scalar inequality
(1 − a φ1 )-1a < 1 used in Section 5. Furthermore, condition (24b) is equivalent to having each

λF times each λΩ be less than 1, and this becomes analogous to the one given in the paragraph
on pages 15-16. Consequently, the same argument as developed above applies for conditions
(24a) and (24b) if the eigenvalues of A + C all have real parts smaller than 1.0, provided that
Ω is determined by the MSV formula (25). What about condition (24c)? Clearly, process

19

consistency implies that all λF > −1, so this condition too would be satisfied if we adopted
that requirement—but we shall not do so. The argument based on our weaker version of the
second WF requirement will be developed shortly in a more general context.
When A and C do not commute, which will usually be the case, the foregoing
reasoning does not hold and a different analytical proof becomes necessary. In this case the
first part of the argument can be built around the equality
(29)

(I − AΩ)(I − F)(I − Ω) = I − (A + C),

which is mentioned by B&P (1995, fn. 34).35 We are assuming that all eigenvalues of A + C
satisfy Re(λA+C) < 1, which implies that det[I − (A + C)] > 0.36 This suggests that
det[I − AΩ] > 0, det[I − F] > 0, and det[I − Ω] > 0 but we have to rule out the possibility that
two of these three determinants are negative and we have to consider individual eigenvalues.
Accordingly, consider a modification of the model in which A and C are each multiplied by a
small positive constant ε, with 0 < ε ≤ 1. Let the resulting MSV values for Ω and F be
denoted Ω(ε) and F(ε). Then in place of (29) we would have
(29’) [I − εAΩ(ε)][I − F(ε)][I − Ω(ε)] = I − ε(A + C).
Clearly, for values of ε close to zero all the eigenvalues of Ω(ε) and F(ε) =
[I − εAΩ(ε)]-1Aε will be smaller in modulus than 1 and will have real parts less than 1.37
Also, the determinants of the three left-hand side matrices will all be positive. Then let ε
increase continuously to 1 and notice that, with the WF requirement, the value of
det[I − ε(A + C)] will remain positive throughout this process. Therefore, the value of each
34

If instead one uses the ordering that makes Λ1 the m smallest (in modulus) eigenvalues, the solution would in
most cases coincide with the MSV solution. In numerical application, one typically uses the ordering just
mentioned, but can modify it, if necessary, as suggested briefly in McCallum (1999, p. 633).
35
It can be derived by writing out F in (29), rearranging, and inserting C for Ω − AΩ2.
36
In what follows, I will repeatedly use the fact that the eigenvalues of a matrix (I − B) satisfy λI−B = 1 − λB.

20

left-hand-side determinant must remain positive since these determinants are continuous
functions of ε. 38 (Even if two of the determinants were to turn positive at the same point, it
would be implied that det[I − (A + C)] = 0, which has been ruled out.) Therefore, at our
solution we have det[I − AΩ] > 0, det[I − F] > 0, and det[I − Ω] > 0. But how do we know
that all eigenvalues of AΩ, F, and Ω will have real parts less than 1? We begin the process
with each having real part less than 1. But, clearly, if any real eigenvalue passed through the
value 1, it would turn the relevant determinant negative, which has been ruled out. How
about complex eigenvalues? They appear, since A and C are real, as conjugate pairs. The
product of any conjugate pair is real and strictly larger than the real part. Thus any such
product would pass through 1 and turn the relevant determinant negative before the real part
were to equal 1, as ε increases. But having a negative value for any of the three determinants
has been ruled out, so the real part of no eigenvalue can exceed 1 during the process or at its
conclusion. This shows that the MSV solution satisfies condition (24a).
Since it is nevertheless possible that there is some eigenvalue of F with real part less
than −1, we need to consider whether our WF requirements guarantee that (24b) and (24c)
are satisfied. For this purpose it is useful to consider the identity
(30)

(I − AΩ)(I + F)(I + Ω) = I + (A + C),

which is derived in a manner similar to (29). If we consider the argument of the previous
paragraph, it will be seen that having some Re(λF) < −1 is possible, since we have not ruled
out the possibility that some Re(λA+C) < −1. Or, an explosive solution with some Re(λΩ) <

−1 is possible. But the latter case is one in which fewer than m of the eigenvalues of M have
37

This statement would not be valid for non-MSV values of Ω.

21

modulus less than 1 whereas the former case has more than m of the eigenvalues of M with
modulus less than 1. (This statement regarding F follows from the discussion on pp. 150-151
of B&P (1995), which indicates that for F to have an eigenvalue with modulus greater than 1,
there must be more than m of the eigenvalues of M with modulus less than 1. For the case
with invertible A matrix, an explicit proof is given in Appendix A.) Thus it is not possible
for (24b) to be violated by having eigenvalues with real parts less than −1 for both F and Ω.
Finally, we need to consider condition (24c). But as in the univariate case, the second
WF condition—which rules out infinite discontinuities in the response coefficients attached
to the exogenous variables in the vector ut—coincides with this third condition, so the latter
does not pose a problem for E-stability.39 Alternatively, if we were to rule out process
inconsistency the current multivariate model would require that all the eigenvalues of F have
modulus smaller than 1. Therefore condition (24c) would be satisfied. We do not adopt this
stronger assumption but note that, even if we did, we would not be excluding the possibility
that Ω could possess an eigenvalue smaller than −1. Thus again dynamic instability is not
precluded by our assumption on A and C, although it would be if we assumed that all of the
eigenvalues of (A + C) have modulus smaller than 1.
It remains to extend the analysis to a more general class of models. First note that the
foregoing argument does not rely upon the nonsingularity of the matrix A. That property is
used above only in the paragraph containing equations (25)-(28), whose sole function is to
illustrate an explicit formula for calculation of Ω for the MSV solution.40 But with singular
A, the relevant calculation can still be accomplished by various procedures. Among these are
38

Note that the present argument implies the existence of (I − AΩ)-1, which E&H (2001, p. 238) and other
writers take for granted. B&P (1997, fn.4) observe that it does not require the invertibility of A and state that
they have found no cases of a singular I − AΩ matrix in any well specified model.
39
This proposition is established in Appendix B.

22

those of Anderson and Moore (1985), B&P (1995, 1997), Uhlig (1999), King and Watson
(1998), and Klein (2001). Thus the foregoing argument does not require that A be
nonsingular; it applies to all models of form (22), that is,
(31)

yt = A Etyt+1 + C yt-1 + ut

where ut = R ut-1 + εt, with R a stable m×m matrix and εt a white noise vector.
Furthermore, it is the case that virtually any linear RE model can be written in form
(31). To see this, consider the formulation of King and Watson (1998) or Klein (2001), as
exposited by McCallum (1999), as follows:
(32)

Here vt is an AR(1) vector of exogenous variables (including shocks) with stable AR matrix
R while xt and kt are m1×1 and m2×1 vectors of non-predetermined and predetermined
endogenous variables, respectively. We assume without loss of generality that B11 is
invertible and that G2 = 0.41 Then we can define yt = [xt’ kt’ xt-1’ kt-1’]’ and write the system
in form (31) with the matrices given as follows:

This representation is important because it is well known that the system (32) permits
any finite number of lags, expectational leads, and lags of expectational leads. Also, any
higher-order AR process for the exogenous variables can be written in AR(1) form. Thus the
only lack of complete generality, for a linear system with stable exogenous forcing variables,
40

Also M is defined in (26), but an analogous definition and argument is straightforward.

23

is that a pure moving-average process for the exogenous variables cannot be included—but
of course one can be approximated closely by a sufficiently high order AR process. Thus we
have shown that our results of this section are applicable to (32), in which form virtually any
linear system can be written. In other words, the basic result described above, that E-stability
is assured for the MSV solution if the eigenvalues of (A + C) have real parts less than 1 and
the second WF condition obtains, is applicable to virtually any linear RE model.
7. Conclusions
A brief statement of the paper’s argument can be developed by adding a few words to
its title, as follows. The minimum state variable solution, which is unique by construction, is
E-stable—and therefore least squares learnable42 in real time—in all linear RE models that
satisfy conditions for being “well formulated.” The latter concept, introduced above and in
McCallum (2002), consists of two requirements. The first requirement is that a model’s
structural parameters are restricted so as to prevent any infinite discontinuity, of the implied
(non-stochastic) steady state vector of endogenous variables, in response to small changes in
these parameters. (This condition is expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of a matrix, which
must be inverted to obtain the steady state solution vector, all of which are required to have
positive real parts.) The second requirement is that the parameters are also restricted to
prevent an infinite discontinuity in the MSV dynamic response coefficient of any endogenous
variable to any of the model’s exogenous forcing variables. The first requirement can be
expressed quite cleanly in terms of the eigenvalues of a matrix that is the sum of matrices
attached to expected future values (one period ahead) and lagged (by one period) values of
the endogenous variables. The second requirement involves the relationship between these
41

If it is desired to include a direct effect of vt on kt+1, this can be accomplished by definition of another variable
in xt.

24

matrices and the matrix of coefficients in a first-order autoregressive representation of the
exogenous forcing variables. The second requirement is relevant only when one or more of
the eigenvalues of the latter matrix is negative. In the univariate case of equation (17), for
example, this requirement is relevant only in highly unusual cases involving f < −1 and ρ < 0.
The second WF requirement could be replaced with the assumption that the model
possesses the property of process consistency, which implies that certain infinite series
relating to expected future values of exogenous variables must be convergent. This condition
is cleaner, but is more restrictive and is not adopted for this paper’s argument.
It should be added that the paper does not present any results pertaining to the
presence or absence of E-stability for non-MSV solutions, a subject that is being explored by
Evans, Honkapohja, Mitra, and others. Finally, it must be recognized that the term “well
formulated” is one that some readers might find misleading or even objectionable. I have
used it rather than “plausible” because the latter is not sufficiently specific. Perhaps “not
implausibly hypersensitive to parameter specification” could be used instead of well
formulated. In any case, it is the concept—not its name—that is important.

42

For explosive MSV solutions, the qualification mentioned on p. 15 is applicable.

25

Appendix A

The agenda here is to show that the eigenvalues of F are the same as for Λ2-1 in
expression (27), i.e., that the eigenvalues of F are the inverses of the m eigenvalues of M that
are not included in Λ1. (The eigenvalues of Λ1 equal those of Ω = − P22-1 P21). This assures us
that we cannot have any eigenvalue with real part smaller than −1 for both F and Ω, for the
former requires that more than m of the eigenvalues of M are smaller in modulus than 1,
while the latter requires that fewer than m of the eigenvalues of M are smaller in modulus
than 1.
From PM = ΛP we have the submatrix P21 = Λ2P22 − P22A-1 so an alternative
expression for Ω, equivalent to (28), is −P22-1(Λ2P22 − P22A-1) and thus we can write
F = (I − AΩ)-1A = (I + AP22-1Λ2P22 − AP22-1P22A-1)-1A
= (AP22-1Λ2P22 )-1A = P22-1Λ2-1P22A-1A = P22-1Λ2-1 P22 .
But the latter has the same eigenvalues as Λ2-1, which is what we set out to establish. Note
that this result is the multivariate counterpart, for the case with an invertible A matrix, of the
univariate result given in footnote 23.

26

Appendix B

The purpose here is to show that for model (22) adoption of the second WF
requirement, that there be no infinite discontinuity in the response of an element of yt to an
element of ut, implies satisfaction of the E-stability condition (24c). In this model, the
undetermined coefficient equations are (26) and the following:
(A-1) Γ = AΩΓ + AΓR + I.
Using F = (I − AΩ)-1A, the latter can be written as
(A-2) Γ = FΓR + (I −AΩ)-1.
Using the well-known identity vec ABC = (C '⊗ A) vec B (e.g., E&H 2001, p. 117), we have
(A-3) vec Γ = (R '⊗ F) vec Γ + vec [(I − AΩ)-1]

implying
(A-4)

vec Γ = [I − (R '⊗ F) ]-1 vec [(I − AΩ)-1].

Then our WF requirement is that all eigenvalues of [I − (R '⊗ F) ] be positive, i.e., that all
eigenvalues of (R '⊗ F) be smaller than 1. But this is the same condition as (24c).
