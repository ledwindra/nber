    "abstract": "\n\nOates reminds us that tax competition among localities in the presence of capital mobility, may lead to inefficiently low tax rates (and benefits). In contrast, the Tiebout paradigm suggests that tax competition yields an efficient outcome, so that there are no gains from tax coordination. This paper demonstrates that when a group of host countries faces an upward supply of migrants, labor and capital income tax rate under competition are higher than under tax coordination, due to a fiscal externality.\n\n",
