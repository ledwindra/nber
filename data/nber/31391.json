    "abstract": "\n\nWe study the effect of community access to mental health and substance use treatment on police officer safety, proxied with on-duty assaults on officers. Police officers often serve as first-responders to people experiencing mental health and substance use crises, which can place police officers at risk. Combining agency-level data on police officer on-duty assaults and county-level data on treatment centers that offer mental health and substance use care, we estimate panel fixed-effects regressions. An additional four centers per county (the average annual increase observed in our data) leads to a 1.3% reduction per police agency in on-duty police officers assaults.\n\n",
