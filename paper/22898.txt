                                          ABSTRACT

We present results from the first study to examine the causal impact of early childhood education
on social preferences of children. We compare children who, at 3-4 years old, were randomized
into either a full-time preschool, a parenting program with incentives, or to a control group. We
returned to the same children when they reached 7-8 years old and conducted a series of
incentivized experiments to elicit their social preferences. We find that early childhood education
has a strong causal impact on social preferences several years after the intervention: attending
preschool makes children more egalitarian in their fairness view and the parenting program
enhances the importance children place on efficiency relative to fairness. Our findings highlight
the importance of taking a broad perspective when designing and evaluating early childhood
educational programs, and provide evidence of how differences in institutional exposure may
contribute to explaining heterogeneity in social preferences in society.

1      Introduction
Early childhood education has become a touchstone issue in the world of public edu-

cation. In the past, randomized control trials such as the High/Scope Perry Preschool

project (Schweinhart et al., 1993; Schweinhart, Montie, Xiang, Barnett, Beleld and

Nores, 2005; Heckman, Moon, Pinto, Savelyev and Yavitz, 2010) and the Abecedarian

Project (Campbell, Ramey, Pungello, Sparling and Miller-Johnson, 2002) have been

used to measure the impact of early education on cognitive achievement and execu-

tive function skills (Heckman, 2000; Heckman, Stixrud, Urzua et al., 2006). Yet, the

impact of early childhood education may extend well beyond human capital forma-

tion. Importantly, it might also shape individuals' moral views, including their social

preferences.

    At least since Adam Smith, social scientists have been aware that social prefer-

ences alter individual choices and potentially market outcomes. While scholars have

more recently explored the social preferences that underlie social and political institu-

tions (Fehr and Schmidt, 1999; Bolton and Ockenfels, 2000; Konow, 2000; Cappelen,

Hole, Sørensen and Tungodden, 2007; Andreoni and Miller, 2002; Fisman, Kariv and

Markovits, 2007), little is known about the causal processes shaping these preferences.

Early childhood is a period of rapid social preference development and appears to be

formative for an individual's social preferences in adulthood (Piaget, 1965; Kohlberg,

1984; Fehr, Bernhard and Rockenbach, 2008; Almås, Cappelen, Sørensen and Tungod-

den, 2010; Sutter and Kocher, 2007; Sutter, Feri, Kocher, Martinsson, Nordblom and

Rützler, 2010; Harbaugh, Krause and Vesterlund, 2007; Bauer, Chytilová and Pertold-

Gebicka, 2014; Ben-Ner, List, Putterman and Samek, 2015; Angerer, Glätzle-Rützler,
                                     1
Lergetporer and Sutter, 2015a).          It is therefore of great importance to understand the

extent to which the social institutions faced in childhood, including early childhood

education, inuence the social preferences of individuals.

    In this paper, we present results from the rst study to examine the causal impact

of early childhood education on social preference formation in children. We take ad-

vantage of a unique, large scale educational intervention and compare children who, at

3-4 years old, were randomized into either a full-time preschool, a parenting program

or to a control group (Fryer, Levitt and List, 2015).             The preschool and parenting

program leverage two very dierent approaches to human capital formation.                    In the

    1 Related work has also explored the development of risk and time preferences of children (e.g.,
Bettinger and Slonim (2007); Castillo, Ferraro, Jordan and Petrie (2011); Sutter, Yilmaz and Oberauer
(2015); Angerer, Lergetporer, Glätzle-Rützler and Sutter (2015b)) and competitiveness preferences
(e.g., Gneezy and Rustichini (2004); Andersen, Ertac, Gneezy, List and Maximiano (2013); Samak
(2013); Buser, Niederle and Oosterbeek (2014)).

former, children are touched directly by our program; while in the latter, children do

not receive any education directly from us and the educational intervention is admin-

istered through the parents. In this way, our design is novel in that we explore how

two dierent approaches to educational investment aect social preferences.

    A further novelty of our design is that we measure the long run impacts of treatment,

four years after the intervention. We returned to the same children when they reached

7-8 years old and conducted a series of incentivized experiments to elicit their social

preferences. On the basis of these experiments, we can study both whether an early

childhood intervention has a causal impact on individual preferences and whether the

content of the intervention is important in and of itself.

    We nd that early childhood education has a strong causal impact on the social

preferences of children several years after the intervention. In particular, we nd that

attending preschool makes children more egalitarian in their fairness view and that

the parenting program enhances the importance children place on eciency relative

to fairness.    Cultural transmission of social preferences, through preschool and the

family, is a potential mechanism that explains these eects.              Our ndings highlight

the importance of taking a broad perspective when designing and evaluating early

childhood programs, and provide evidence of how dierences in institutional exposure

may contribute to explaining heterogeneity in social preferences in modern societies.




2       Experimental Design and Results
We study the behavior of children who took part in the Chicago Heights Early Child-

hood Center (CHECC) project, a unique, large-scale eld experiment implemented in

a prototypical low performing urban school district in Chicago Heights, Illinois (Fryer

et al., 2015). In 2010-2012, children ages 3-4 years old were randomized into one of
                2
three groups:


    •   Preschool:    Included a free 9-month full day preschool for the child, but no direct

        intervention for the parents.


    •   Parent Academy:        Included a 9-month incentivized parenting program for the

        parents to learn how to teach the child at home, but no direct intervention for

        the child.   The parents in this program met for bi-monthly sessions and were

    2 Children participated in each of these programs for 1 to 2 years, depending on year and age at
enrollment. Children who were 3 years old and enrolled in 2010 participated for 2 years, while the
remaining children (those who were 4 years old at enrollment or those who enrolled in the second year
of the program, 2011) participated for 1 year.




                                                 2
        nancially incentivized based on their participation in the program and on their

        child's performance on tests and evaluations.


    •   Control: The child and their parents did not receive any treatment interventions.
Children who participated in the Preschool treatment group received either the            Literacy
Express    curriculum or the    Tools of the Mind      curriculum.
                                                                     3
                                                                         While the two curricula

consist of dierent lesson plans and focus areas, both programs aim to promote social-

emotional skills and incorporate small group interactions and partnered activities. The

curriculum for the Parent Academy group was developed using concepts from                 Literacy
Express   and   Tools of the Mind.    However, unlike at the Preschool, children in Parent

Academy neither attended school nor interacted with peers, and thus did not practice

these skills through our program. Importantly, families that participated in the Parent

Academy program could earn up to $3,400 per year based on their child's performance

on various evaluations and assessments (Fryer et al., 2015).

    We returned to these children in the spring of 2014, when they were in 1st-2nd

grade, and conducted a series of incentivized social preference experiments. While we

were unable to follow up with all children who participated in the CHECC program, we

took advantage of a prior agreement with parents and with one of the school districts

that participated in the study, which allowed us to conduct the experiments with the

CHECC children enrolled in this school district during the school day. We identied 303

children who had participated in CHECC and were enrolled in one of the 9 elementary

schools in the district at the time of the experiments. All of these children participated

in our experiments.

    Selection is not an issue under the assumption that families did not move in and

out of district conditional on CHECC treatment assignment. This assumption is rea-

sonable since families could still be part of the program even if they moved out of

the district. Furthermore, the assumption is substantiated by examining the share of

CHECC participants who remain in our sample, by treatment. Our sample captured

38.4% of the original Preschool group, 38.4% of the Parent Academy group and 34.7%

of the Control group. Finally, as displayed in Table 1, children were balanced across

treatment with respect to observable characteristics.


                                     [ Table 1 about here ]

   3 Children were also randomly assigned to the curriculum. For more information about Literacy Ex-
press, see http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/interventionreport.aspx?sid=288. For more information about
Tools of the Mind, see http://toolsofthemind.org. Since sample sizes are small, we do not split by
curriculum in the analysis.




                                                 3
    The children took part in four experiments, where they made decisions either as a

stakeholder, distributing income between themselves and another child, or as a specta-

tor, distributing income between two other children. We provide a simple social pref-

erence model to guide our analysis and the interpretation of the results. The model

assumes that children make trade-os among three primary motives that have been

shown to be essential for understanding distributive choices: self-interest, fairness, and

eciency.        We assume that children who act as stakeholders maximize the following

utility function (adapted from Cappelen et al. (2007); Cappelen, Konow, Sørensen and

Tungodden (2013)):




                              V (yi ) = yi − βi (yi − mi )2 − αi (Xi − maxXi )2


where      yi   is what the child allocates to herself,       mi   is what the child considers fair

to keep,        Xi   is the sum of resources distributed given the distributive decision, and

maxXi       is the maximal sum of resources that can be distributed if the child chooses

the most ecient alternative. The weight attached to fairness relative to self-interest

is captured by         βi ,   the weight attached fairness relative to eciency is captured by

βi /αi ,   and what the child views as fair is captured by         mi .   Our framework thus allows

heterogeneity in the weights attached to fairness relative to self-interest and eciency

and in fairness views. We assume that children maximize the same utility function when

they act as spectators and distribute resources between two other children, with the

following exceptions: for spectators, the rst term (yi ) is always zero, and the second

term (βi ) is dened for the spectator's preferences over the income of one of the two

stakeholders in the pair, specically the child with the lowest initial earnings. Hence,

trivially, the interior solution for a spectator is to choose what he or she considers the

fair allocation of the total earnings between the two stakeholders in the absence of

eciency concerns. If a child has to make a trade-o between fairness and eciency

in a spectator situation, then the decision will depend on the importance assigned to

fairness relative to eciency, (βi /αi ).

    In this model, early childhood interventions may shape the social preferences of the

child in three ways: i) in the weight she attaches to fairness relative to self-interest (βi )

ii) in the weight she attaches to fairness relative to eciency (βi /αi ) and iii) in what

she views as a fair distribution (mi ). By comparing the distributive decisions of the

Preschool children and the Parent Academy children with the decisions of the Control

children in our experiments, we can study how the early childhood education programs

causally aected these fundamental dimensions of the children's social preferences.


                                                      4
   The experiments were conducted one-on-one, always in the same order, with the

experimenter reading the instructions aloud (see appendix for instructions). Table 2

summarizes the four experiments. Following the experiments, we distributed stickers

that the participant allocated in the spectator decisions to non-participating children.


                                     [ Table 2 about here ]


   To study whether the early childhood programs aected the weight that the chil-

dren placed on fairness relative to self-interest (βi ), we conducted a real-eort dictator

experiment in which participants acted as stakeholders. Participants rst completed

a real-eort task in which they sorted pieces of white paper into one bin and pieces

of colorful paper into another bin. Afterwards, participants were told that they and

another anonymous child, who had completed the same task, together had earned ten

coins, which they could exchange for small prizes. The coins were placed in a row in

front of the participants and they were asked to decide how many coins they wanted to

take for themselves (by putting them on the plate they were told was their own plate)

and how many coins they wanted to give to the other child (by putting them on the

plate they were told was the other child's plate).

   To ensure that all participants made a distributive decision in the dictator exper-

iment, the participants were asked to do the sorting task a second time and another

child determined the distribution of earnings for this task. The fact that both children

in a pair had completed the same task makes it reasonable to assume that they consider

it fair to divide the earnings equally. The real-eort dictator experiment thus placed

the child in a distributive situation in which she faced a trade-o between self-interest

(taking everything for herself ) or fairness (splitting the rewards equally).

   In the remaining three experiments, participants acted as spectators, making dis-

tributive decisions for two other anonymous children, rather than for themselves. These

were children who had not participated in the experiment. In the eciency experiment

(measuring   βi /αi ),   participants made a spectator decision that had real consequences

for two anonymous children, but not for themselves (Cappelen et al., 2013). Partici-

pants were asked to choose between two alternative allocations of stickers illustrated in

a picture: one allocation gave two stickers to each child; the other allocation gave one

sticker to one child and six stickers to the other child. We assume that the children

viewed an unequal allocation of stickers between the two children as unfair in this sit-

uation, since neither of the children had any special claim to the stickers. The unequal

distribution is, however, the ecient alternative, since it maximizes the total number

of stickers received by the two children. The eciency experiment thus placed the child



                                               5
in a distributive situation in which she had to make a trade-o between eciency and

fairness.

   In the dictator experiment and in the eciency experiment, we assume that the

children considered it fair to divide equally. It is well established, however, that people

do not view all inequalities as unfair and that there is signicant heterogeneity in

whether people nd inequalities due to merit or luck fair or unfair (Cappelen et al.,

2007, 2013).   To identify how the early childhood intervention shaped the children's

fairness views (mi ), specically their willingness to accept inequalities due to merit or

luck, we conducted two spectator experiments that we refer to as `merit' and the `luck'

experiments.

   In both the merit and luck experiments, participants made decisions as a spectator

in a real distributive situation in which two anonymous other children had unequal

initial earnings of stickers. The experiments diered with respect to the source of the

initial inequality in earnings. In the merit experiment, participants were informed that

two other children had participated in a memory task and that one child did well and

earned eight stickers, while the other child did not do so well and earned two stickers.

Each child's earnings were indicated by placing the stickers the child had earned on

the table below the plate that the spectator was told belonged to this child.          The

participant was then asked to determine the nal allocation of stickers by moving the

stickers from the table to either of the children's plates.

   In the luck experiment, participants were presented with a situation in which the

inequality was the result of luck rather than merit. The initial allocation of earnings

between the two children was determined by the ip of a coin done by the experimenter

in front of the participant. The `lucky' child earned ten stickers while the `unlucky' child

earned no stickers. The earnings of the winner were indicated by placing ten stickers

below the winner's plate. Again, the participants determined the nal distribution of

stickers by moving stickers from the table to either of the plates belonging to each

child.

   In the luck and merit experiments, we placed participants in distributive situations

in which there were no self-interest or eciency concerns. We thus assume that the

participants implement what they view as a fair allocation, which means that their

choices identify whether they consider inequalities due to merit or luck to be fair.



Results
   Figure 1 provides a summary of the decisions made by the children in each of the

four experiments. The average share given to the other child in the dictator treatment




                                             6
was 42%, which is similar to what is found in previous dictator games conducted with

children in this age group (Fehr et al., 2008; Engel, 2011). We observe a spike at the

50/50 distribution: 67% of the children chose to share exactly half of the coins, while

only 7% of the children kept everything for themselves. Very few children gave more

than half of the coins to the other child. In the eciency treatment, we observe that

49% of the participants preferred the ecient, but unfair, allocation, while 51% of the

participants chose the inecient, but fair, allocation.


                                 [ Figure 1 about here ]


   In the two fairness view experiments, we observe spikes at the 50/50 allocation: 47%

of the children in the merit experiment and 49% of the children in the luck experiment

chose an equal distribution. The majority of the children, however, found it fair that

one child received more stickers than the other child when their initial earnings diered.

We also observe that very few children gave more stickers to the child with the lower

initial earnings.

   In the analysis of how the early childhood education programs aected distributive

behavior, we focus on how much inequality the children implement in each of the

experiments.    We measure inequality by the absolute dierence in the units, coins

or stickers, received by the two children in the pair divided by the total number of

units (which is equivalent to the Gini coecient in the present distributive situations).

Figure 2 summarizes across the 4 experiments how children in each of our treatment

groups chose to allocate. In Table 3, we report ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions

in which dummy variables for Preschool and Parent Academy are regressed on the

inequality that children implement in each of the four experiments, with and without

demographic controls. All regressions also control for the time of day and experimenter

xed eects (not reported). Taken together, insights from Figure 2 and the regressions

reported in Table 3 lead to three main ndings.        First, from the upper-left panel of

Figure 2, we observe that the early childhood education programs did not aect the

selshness of children. The inequality implemented in the dictator experiment by the

children from the Preschool group and the Parent Academy group is very similar to the

inequality implemented by the children in the Control group (p=0.793 for Preschool

and   p=0.516   for Parent Academy; all   p-values   reported come from the coecient on

the Preschool or Parent dummy variable in Table 3 regressions).


                                 [ Figure 2 about here ]


                                 [ Table 3 about here ]


                                             7
The second main nding, shown in the upper-right panel of Figure 2, is that the chil-

dren who took part in the Parent Academy program implemented 34% more inequality

in the eciency experiment than the Control children (p=0.024). The Parent Academy

program thus caused children to place signicantly more weight on eciency relative to

fairness in their distributive decisions. The Preschool children, on the other hand, are

not statistically dierent from the Control group in how they made trade-os between

eciency and fairness (p=0.635). Finally, the third main nding is shown in the lower

two panels of Figure 2, which provides evidence of the Preschool group being more

egalitarian in their fairness view than the children in the Control group. In the luck

experiment, the Preschool children chose to implement 27% less inequality than the

children in the Control group (p=0.023). In the merit experiment, the Preschool chil-

dren implemented 15% less inequality than the children in the Control group (p=0.057).

Examining the luck experiment and the merit experiment combined, we nd that the

Preschool children implemented 22% less inequality than the Control group children

(p=0.014). In contrast, we do not nd any evidence of the Parent Academy aecting

the children's fairness view. The Parent Academy children implemented slightly less

inequality in the luck experiment and slightly more inequality in the merit experiment

than the children in the Control group, but these dierences are not statistically signif-

icant (p=0.352 in the luck experiment,   p=0.649   in the merit experiment, and   p=0.692
for the average in the luck and the merit experiment).




3     Discussion
Our results provide evidence of early childhood education having a strong causal im-

pact on social preferences several years after the children took part in the programs.

We also nd that the content of the childhood intervention is of great import: the

Parent Academy makes children more eciency oriented, while the Preschool makes

children more egalitarian. By showing that early experiences matter for preferences,

these results are consistent with recent important work on the cultural transmission of

preferences through learning and other forms of social interaction (Bisin and Verdier,

2010).

    We propose that a potential mechanism for the impact of Preschool is that conicts

at school are resolved by teachers through an egalitarian fairness norm, which is then

transmitted to and internalized by the children in the Preschool group. The Parent

Academy may have aected the interaction in the family by introducing an eciency

argument for giving priority to the child who was part of the program. If the parents




                                            8
justied an unequal allocation of parental resources among the children by appealing

to eciency considerations, this reasoning might be transmitted to and internalized

by the children in the Parent Academy group.      Indeed, in a related paper, we show

that the Parent Academy induces parents to respond to short term cash incentives by

moving scarce resources from one child to another based on eciency (Chuan, List and

Samek, 2016).

   Our results also contribute to a better understanding of how social preferences

develop in childhood and shed light on a possible explanation for the observed hetero-

geneity in social preferences, by showing that dierences in institutional exposure can

result in lasting dierences in social preferences. Previous work has documented that

there are signicant changes in social preferences throughout childhood (e.g., Fehr

et al. (2008); Almås et al. (2010); Fehr, Glätzle-Rützler and Sutter (2013); Pamela,

Miguel and Velde (2015)). We complement this literature by showing that educational

institutions play an important role in shaping social preferences at a young age, which

suggests that institutions in society are important for shaping the social development

of children.

   This insight is important for at least two reasons.      First, it cautions us that we

should take into account the eect that institutions have on preferences when we eval-

uate their consequences. Second, it means that institutions can be used strategically

to shape people's preferences.   Cantoni, Chen, Yang, Yuchtman and Zhang (2014)

have highlighted the importance of curricula by showing that changes to curricula

in Chinese schools led to changed views on political participation and democracy in

China. Our results also complement results from experiments conducted concurrently

(Kosse, Deckers, Schildberg-Hörisch and Falk, n.d.), which show that random assign-

ment to an early childhood mentoring program has a causal eect on children's level

of pro-sociality. Importantly, our results contribute to the research on how education

inuences human capital formation (Becker, 2009). The literature on human capital

formation has increasingly emphasized the importance of taking a broader view of

human capital formation, including the role of non-cognitive or `soft skills' (Heckman,

2000; Heckman et al., 2006; Heckman, 2006). Our study highlights that early childhood

education is crucial for the formation of social preferences. More research is needed to

identify the causal mechanisms driving this relationship.

   At a more specic level, we nd that attending preschool makes children more

egalitarian. This result is supported by recent work by Heckman and Raut (2016) that

argues that the best way to reduce pre-tax inequality is to have universal preschool. Our

results show that universal preschool will have an eect on willingness to redistribute,




                                           9
and thus on post-tax inequality.     Second, our results suggest that early childhood

interventions might aect the dynamics in the family (Kalil and Meyer, 2015). Both

of these areas represent fruitful avenues for future research.

                                         and an unlucky child.


Note:   The table provides an overview of the four experiments the children took part in.          In the
stakeholder experiment, the participants made a decision that aected their own payo as well as the
payo of another child. In the spectator experiments, the participants made decisions that aected the
payo of two other children. The experiments were conducted in the following order for all subjects:
Dictator, Merit, Luck and Eciency.

     Note: The table reports ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions of a participant's chosen level of inequality in the four games and for the merit and
     luck game combined. "Preschool" is an indicator variable taking the value one if the child was in the Preschool group and "Parent Academy" is an
     indicator variable taking the value one if the child was in the Parent Academy group. Age is the child's average age in years; Female is a dummy
     for the child being a girl; "Black" and "Hispanic" are dummies for the child being Black or Hispanic respectively. Included, but not reported, are
     controls for the time of day when the child took part in the experiment and experimenter xed eects. Even though 303 children participated in the
     experiment, since each game was voluntary, some children did not complete all of the games. 1 child did not complete the Merit game, 4 children
     did not complete the Luck game, 1 child did not complete the Dictator game and 1 child did not complete the Eciency game. Standard errors in
     parentheses.
