                         Abstract


     In this paper, we have developed an operational method
for estimating error components regression models when the
variance-covariance matrix of the disturbance terms is un-
known. Monte Carlo studies were conducted to compare the
relative efficiency of the pooled estimator obtained by this
procedure to (a) an ordinary least squares estimator based
on data aggregated over time, (b) the covariance estimator,
(c) the ordinary least squares estimator, and (d) a gener-
alized least squares estimator based on a known variance-
covariance matrix. For T small, and large p, this estimator
definitely performs better than the other estimators which
are also based on an estimated value of the variance--covariance
matrix of the disturbances. For p small and large T it com-
pares equally well with the other estimators.

                     AND THEIR APPLICATIONS




                           Section 1

                          Introduction


        In several recent studies, attempts have been made to

analyze the problems involved in pooling cross section and

time series data by error components (or variance components)

regression models. These !nodels can be formulated as


                                   +
(1.1)                +
                         E6kZk.        uit
                                   (i1,2,...,n; tl,2,...,T),

where        is an observation on the dependent variable for

individual     in period t. Zkjt is an observation on the kth

independent variable, cD    is   an intercept term, 3k (k1,2,.. ,K-l)
are the fixed but unknown slope coefficients, and u± is an error
term. This disturbance term is supposed to represent the net

effect of numerous individually unimportant, but collectively
significant, variables whidh have been omitted from the analysis.

Some of these are specific to the individual and remain invariant

over time (say p1); some are specific to the time period but are
                                  --2--


invariant over all individuals (say Xi); and some are specific

to both individual and time (say            In this case we can

write       as

                     +        +
(1.2)                    X.

Mundlak (10) and Hoch (5) analyzed this model, treating p and
                                       n            T
   as unknown parameters and assu4ning E i.  0 and E A = 0.
 L                                         i=l     t:l L
Maddala (9) points out a principal weakness in this approach:
it eliminates a major portion of the variation among both the

explained and the explanatory variables when the between indi-
viduals and between time periods variation is large.      This ap-

proach can also cause a substantial loss in degrees of freedom.
An alternative approach is to treat all components as random.

This case was analyzed by Wallace and Hussain (1L), Maddala (9),

Nerlove (12), and Swamy and the present author (13).1
        Under the assumptions of weakly non--stochastic X's and

normally distributed disturbance terms, both approaches yield

asymptotically equivalent estimates with asymptotically equi-
valent variance--covariance matrices. In fact, it can be shown

 that there are an infinite number of estimators which have the

 same asymptotic variance-coVarianCe matrices.2


 1.     Whether or not the individual effects may be treated as
        parameters or random components for the purpose of statis-
        tical analysis depends upon the underlying data generating
        mechanism assumed. For an illuminating discussion of such
        data generating Tnechanisms, see Nerlove (11) p. 3614.

 2.     See Swamy and Arora (13) p. 267.

    Asymptotic properties, however, are cold comfort to the
econometrician for whom the choice of a practical estimator

(and its related small sample properties) is a problem of
crucial importance. Unfortunately, because of mathematical
intractibility, small sample properties are often hard to
obtain theoretically. We therefore employ Monte Carlo experi-
ments to evaluate relative efficiency of the various estimators.

     The plan of this paper is as follows: In section 2, a

means of estimating error components regression models is
developed for a case when the variance-covariance matrix of
the disturbance term is unknown. We also show the equivalence
of this estimator with an ordinary least squares estimator

when inter-individual and inter-temporal variations are zero.

In section 3, the asymptotic properties of this estimator are
derived. Section 4 describes the design of the Monte Carlo

experiments and compares the relative efficiency of this esti-

mator with the ordinary least squares estimator, a covariance

 estimator, an ordinary least squares estimator based on data
 aggregated over time and ,a generalized least squares estimator

 based on a known variance--covariance matrix of the disturbance
 terms. Concluding remarks are presented in section 5. An
 efficient way of generating random numbers and independently
 distributed normal variates is described in an appendix to

 this paper.

       Estimation of Error Components Regression Models


       Let us assume that u1                      +   and the components

       and           are random such that

Let us further assume that p1 and                     are independent of each

other. Furthermore T > K and n > K and the variances a2 and


3.     In (13) Swamy and I have analytically shown that the
       estimator based onthe assumption of both pj and A-
       being random is more efficient than either Ehe co-
       variance estimator or the ordinary least squares esti-
       mator only if (a) n and T are sufficiently larger than
       10, and (b) if the sum of squares due to variation over
       time exceeds the sum of squares due to remaining varia-
       tion. If these conditions are not satisfied, random
       error components model with both components random may
       give results inferior to other estimators. For a case
       where either n or T is less than 10, we conjecture that
       the error components models with a random component (the
       other component being a parameter or zero) perform better
       than the model which assumes both Pj and At as random.
       Here we consider a model with AtA for all t, but we can
       easily treat all At's as different.

Li..   A model in this form was also used by Kuh (7), except that
       he did not assume Pj and Vit are uncorrelated. Hussain (6)

plication of the ordinary least squares procedure might lead
to an inefficient estima.tor of 3.

        Let us consider an orthogonal matrix, °T' of order T

such that its first row is equal to i/1T. Let                          =

        Define the transformations Q1                     (ItT/vW) and Q2    (IC1).
By applying the transformation Q1 to all nT observations, we get


(2.3)          y1 X + u1,
where y1 Q1y is an nXl vector of transformed dependent var-
iables, and u1 is an nxl vector of transformed observations.

The variance-covariance matrix of u1 is


(2.4)          Eu1u1       Q1EuuQ1

Substituting for Euu' from (2.2) and simplifying we get

Thus the variance-covariance matrix reduces to scalar form,
a best linear unbiased estimator of                        is an OLS estimator

The va'jano-covariance matrix of (l) is

Applying the transformation Q2         (IC1)   to all nT observations

we have


(2.9)      y2   Z26 + u2


where y2    Q2y is an nTxl vector of tr.nsformed observations
on the dependent variable, Z2 is an nT#xK matrix of transformed

observations on K independent variables, u2 = Q2u is an nTxl
vector of transformed disturbances, and use is also made of the

result Q2inT = 0.     The variance-covariance matrix of u2 is

The variance-covariance matrix of (2) is a2(ZZ2)1. Notice

that Q1Q2        0. The rank of Q1 is equal to the rank of

This indicates that in estimating (2.3) and (2.9) we have used
up all the orthogonal linear combinations of the available
observations.       S(l) and S(2) are two uncorrelated estimators

of the same parametric vector and we can pool them in the

        The estimator (O) of can be written in the generalized

least squares form as follows:
                                                                        -l

Substituting y W + e, where e                               [uN, u;] in (3.2), we get

A generalized least squares estimator for a given V, as obtained

in (2.12), can also be expressed as follows:

If we assume that U's are normally distributed, and since
                                                                    0, we an show that the
M1Z1N MX1 [In - X1(XX1)1X]X1
 linear form Z1N1 is distributed independently of the quadratic

 form a2 yM1y1/(n-K) .                           Similarly,        we can show that the

 linear form Z2u2 is independently distributed of the quadratic
                                             --12--


form                yM2y2/(nT-K). With these results, we can show
that


(3.5)               E[()IO] = 6

Since        the expectation of 6 over the distribution of                      is 6,

i.e., E6              6, this   proves that 6(0)          is   an unbiased estimator

of 6.

To establish the asymptotic properties of 6(0), we assume that
                                                          --l -
X's are weakly non-stochastic and, for a fixed n, urn (nT) Z1NZ1,

urn      (nT)-'z;z2 are all finite positive definite matrices.7

For a fixed n, under the above assumptions, we can show that

i.e., 6(e) is a consistent estimator of 6.



7.           The assumption of non-stochastic implies that the time
             pattern of the variable is bounded by some finite limits,
             even though it is not necessary for the pattern of the
             variable to repeat itself. The meaning of non-stochastic
             X's is simply that the realization of the X's is in ac-
             cordance with some fixed (albeit unknown) process. Since
             economic data are stochastic, whichever assumption we
             adopt about the nature of the fixity of X's, we are sin--
             plifying and possibly mis-specifying the model. See also
             Wallace and Hussain (P4) pp. 55--72.

Under the above assumptions, we can readily show that V is a

ccnsistent estimator for V, and that 6(0), as obtained in

(2.15), is asymptotically equivalent to 6(0), in the sense

that /i[6(0)         6(0)] converges in probability to zero as

T+oo, both coefficient estimators being asymptotically normally
distributed with mean vector 6 and covariance matrix         (WVW).
Since plim            =        2, we can further show that () is also
                          Ii
        T+oo

asymptotically      equivalent to the covariance estimator 6, i.e.,


(3.7)          plim /iTI6(G) -- 61      0
                T+°

In fact we can show that there is an infinitely large number

of estimators which yield asymptotically equivalent estimates

with asymptotically equivalent variance-covariance matrices.
Thus asymptotic theory casts relatively little light on the
comparative small sample properties of the estimators. In the

next section, we evaluate relative efficiency of the various

estimation procedures by using a Monte Carlo study.




                                                                        .

                Design of the Experiment and the
        Comparative Properties of the Various Estimators


     The design of the Monte Carlo experiments given here is

similar to that of Nerlove, except that our model contains an
inLercept and we generate random numbers by a slightly differ-

ent, but more efficient, method.8 Since Nerlove has already
done extensive Monte Carlo studies, we examine intensively

only those cases with large inter-individual heterogeneity and

varying T. The model is given by


(L.l)            =       +           + 'i     +
                                                  'it
The explanatory variable, X1, held fixed throughout the
experiment, is generated as follows:


(.2)          X1 =   o.i(t-l)    +
                                     l.05X1±t_i
                                                        +
                                                            w,
where w is uniformly distributed in the range from 0 to 2.
Initial values of X10 are chosen at random from the uniformly
distributed numbers in the range 0 to 100. To generate nT
values of        independent normal variables with zero mean and

init variance, n p.'s are first selected with                       N(0,

nT          are then selected with                      N(0, cY2), and these are

summed   to   give the               Defining p, the intra-class correla-

         Twelve sets of y's were generated for, various combina-

tions of the parameter values                 0 and 5;        0.5 and 0.8;

p        0, 0.4 and 0.8; and a2    10. Initially n is set at 25 and

T at 6 .        For each set of parameters, five estimating proce-
dures were examined:

          (a) OLS estimator based on data aggregated over time,



          (b)   covariance estimator, (2),

          (c)   ordinary least squares, (s),

          (d)   pooled estimator based on the estimated variance--

                covariance matrix, ô(O),
          (e) generalized least squares based on known variance-

                covariance matrix, (8).

          In each experiment, 20 repetitions are performed, from
which the mean and the mean square error of the estimated
coefficients are calculated. The entire set of experiments is

ibepeated with T set at 15, giving 480 runs and 24 tables of



    9.    These parameter's were selected from the initial set of
          parameters c'    0.0, 0.5,       1.0,
                                         5.0 and 10.0;
                                                    a2 =
                                                            0.1,

          0.5, 08; p= 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6and0.8;
          For these 150 sets of parameters 2 repetitions were per-
          formed. On the basis of mean square error of the estima-
          tors in the various estimating procedures only 12 para-
          meter sets were selected for intensive study. The choice
          of these parameter values may itself cause bias in our
          results, but the very consistency of the trend strengthens
          our belief that this is a representative set.

      From Table 1, we find that the mean values of           and

for all estimating methods are finitely close to the true
values, thus demonstrating that all estimators under considera-

tion are   unbiased,     but that the mean square error for the dif-

ferent estimators varies considerably. The mean square error

of OLS--Agg. is about three times as large as that of the
generalized least squares estimator, while those of the covari-

only   about twice as large. The mean square error of the
pooled estimator is nearly the same as that of the generalized

least squares.
       This is true for all values of p except pO. In this
case, all estimators have mean square error equal to that of

the generalized least squares estimator.11 As p increases,
sà does the ratio of the mean square error of the OLS estimator
tc that of the GLS estimator, but for all values of p the mean

square error of the pooled estimator nearly equals the mean

square error of the GLS. Further, for large values of p,
the OLS method gives a serious underestimate of a2, giving low
standard errors of the estimates. In contrast, the standard
errors for the pooled estimator and the GLS are nearly equal.

As T increases, the mean square error of the covariance esti-
mator declines, becoming almost equal to that of the pooled

estimator and the GLS estimator.
       Hence we see, on the basis of the criterion of minimum

mean square error, that the pooled estimator compares favor-
ably, for all T's and all p's, with all other estimators which

do not require a prior knowledge of the variance-covariance
matrix. Furthermore, this estimator shows definite superiority
to other estimators for small T's and large p. On the basis of

 the criterion of unbiasedness, this compares equally well with

 all other estimators.

                         Conclusion


     In this paper, we have developed an operational method

for estimating error components regression models when the
variance-covarjance matrix of the disturbance terms is un-
known. Monte Carlo studies were conducted to compare the

relative efficiency of the pooled estimator obtained by this
procedure to (a) an ordinary least squares estimator based
on data aggregated over time, (b) the covariance estimator,

(c) the ordinary least squares estimator, and Cd) a gener-
alized least squares estimator based on a known variance-
covariance matrix. For T small and large p, this estimator

definitely performs better than the other estimators which
are also based on an estimated value of the variance-covarjance

matrix of the disturbances. For p small and large T it com-
pares equally well with the other estimators. In this instance,
therefore, we are able to give a definite unconditional answer

to the question posed to Nerlove's Dodo, "But who has won?"--
the pooled estimator, of course!

                Random Number Generating Procedures

          A desired sequence of random numbers X is obtained by

setting

               Xn+1     (aX
                          n
                            + c) mod m           -- 0
                                               m >


where a is the multiplier, c is the increment and m is the
modulus, a>0, c>O, m>c, m>a, and m>X0, where X0 is the starting
value. This method is called linear congruential sequence.

When c0, the random generation process is slightly faster,
but the maximum period length (length after which sequence
starts repeating itself) can not be achieved. Nerlove (11)
in order to avoid this problem, suggests mixing two random

sequences into a third, so that the third one is extremely
random. We use a method suggested by Maclaren and Marsaglia
as described below.1

          A quite random sequence      Given methods for generating

two sequences Xn and Y, this method produces a "considerably
more random" sequence. We use an auxiliary table V(0), V(l),

     .,   V(k-l),   where k is some number chosen for convenience,

usually in the neighborhood of 100. Initially, the V-table
is filled with the first k values of the X-sequence.

                                  --22--


     Step 1:   [Generate X, Y]             Set X, Y equal to the next

          number of the sequence (X Y) respectively.
     Step 2:   [Extract j]        Set 5        [kY/rn], where m is the

          modulus used in the sequence Y; i.e., 5 is a random
          value, 0 < 5 <     k   determined by Y.

     Step 3:   [Exchange]        Output V(j) and then set V(j) ÷ X.


     This method gives an incredibly long period if the periods
of (X) and (Y) are relatively prime; and even if the period
is of no consequence, there is very little relation between
the nearby terms of the sequence. To generate independently
normal variates we follow the Polar Method, which consists of

generating two independent random variables (u1 and u2) uni-

formly distributed between zero and one.2 A set of independent
normal variates with mean zero and variance one is obtained by
the transformation

                                 1/2
          w1 = (--2 log u1)            cos (2iru2)

                                 1/2                 3
          w2 = (--2 log u2)            cos (2iru1)




2.   To generate variable uniformly distributed between zero
     and one, we first generate some random number X between
     zero and in as described above, and then the fraction
     u1 = X/m will lie between zero and one.
3.   For a comprehensive discussion of this method see
     Knuth (8) pp. 103-105; also see Nerlove (11), p. 368
     footnote 11.
