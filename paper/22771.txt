Vertical Information Restraints: Pro- and Anti-Competitive Impacts of Minimum Advertised
Price Restrictions

ABSTRACT
We consider vertical contracts where the retail market may involve search frictions. Minimum
advertised price restrictions (MAP) act as a restraint on customers’ information and so can
increase search frictions in the retail sector. Such restraints, thereby, soften retail competition—an
impact also generated by resale price maintenance (RPM). However, by accommodating
(consumer or retailer) heterogeneity, MAP can allow for higher manufacturer profits than RPM.
We show that they can do so through facilitating price discrimination among consumers;
encouraging service provision; and facilitating manufacturer collusion. Thus, welfare effects may
be positive or negative compared to RPM or to the absence of such restrictions.

Introduction

When a retailer enters into a distribution agreement with a manufacturer, it is well
understood that the agreement may impose ‘vertical’ restraints on the retailer that
restrict price or non-price aspects of retailer activity.1 Price restraints include resale
price maintenance (RPM), in which the manufacturer imposes floors and/or ceilings
in retail pricing. Commonly considered non-price restraints typically include exclusivity provisions or the imposition of sales territories. This paper considers a third
type of vertical restraint, information restraints. To focus the discussion, minimum
advertised price (MAP) policies are examined.2 MAP policies impose a floor on the
price at which retailers can advertise a product, but, crucially, not the price at which
it can be sold to a consumer. That is, even if a MAP policy imposes a floor of $10 a
unit on advertised prices, nothing restricts the retailer from selling it to a consumer
for $7.
The pro- and anti-competitive impacts of MAP policies are examined through
the lens of a series of closely related models. Since, superficially, MAP and RPM
policies appear similar, the economic impact of these policies are compared and
contrasted. Two themes emerge. First, for MAP policies to have any market impact,

consumers need to have an informational (search) friction that advertising helps
alleviate. Hence, in every setting we consider search frictions are a central feature.
Without search, MAP is irrelevant to market outcomes. Second, MAP policies soften
competition by obscuring prices. Thus, consumers allocate themselves to competitors
somewhat randomly, being unable to sort as they would if perfectly informed as to
prices. By contrast, RPM softens competition by equalizing prices. When consumers,
or retailers, are heterogenous, MAP is helpful in retaining the flexibility to profitably
accommodate heterogeneity. Thus, MAP will have an impact on markets when search
and heterogeneity among similarly situated economic actors are important features
of the environment.
We explore these themes through three interrelated models. These models are:
• The price discrimination model: in which it is shown that MAP policies allow
manufacturers to imperfectly separate high and low search cost consumers,
and better extract surplus from high value consumers with high search costs.
That is, the MAP policy obscures actual prices, allowing search patterns to be
leveraged as a screening device.3
• The service model: in which it is shown that by obscuring prices, MAP policies soften competition and protect retailer profits, while allowing retailers to
optimize subject to their heterogenous marginal costs of retailing. This can increase the returns to retailers from providing service that expands the market
(such as informative advertising). By softening competition, while retaining
retailer flexibility, MAP can dominate RPM as a means for manufacturers to
profitably incentivize retailers.4
• The collusion model: in which MAP raises cartel profits and stability, in markets where consumer search is important, by allowing manufacturers to more
easily monitor each other’s behaviour. Notably this is done without sacrificing
the ability of cartel members to tailor actual transaction prices to local market
conditions.5 That is, whereas RPM may be viewed as having features of a
3

Throughout we assume that retailers cannot price discriminate. Instead, discrimination occurs
through the consumers’ choice of retailer. Chen (1999) considers the effect of RPM when retailers
can engage in price discrimination.
4
Telser (1960) is typically cited for the idea that RPM promotes service (though it is also
discussed in Yamey (1954), for example). More recent formalizations and developments include
Matthewson and Winter (1984); Klein and Murphy (1988); and Deneckere, Marvel and Peck (1997).
We follow the literature in considering pro-consumer service, although note that, as in the model
of exclusion in Asker and Bar-Isaac (2014), service need not be helpful to the consumer.
5
In formalizing this argument, we adapt the framework of Jullien and Rey (2007) to accommodate MAP.

price-fixing scheme, MAP may be viewed as analogous to a market division
scheme.
In understanding the way MAP restrictions work, and in particular how they
differ from the price restraint embodied in an RPM restriction, it is useful to examine
a typical MAP provision. As an example, consider the January 1, 2016, MAP policy
of Samsung Techwin America (a manufacturer of security cameras and surveillance
equipment).6 The MAP price is specified as a percentage of the manufacturer’s
suggested retail price (in this instance, 40% of MSRP). The policy explicitly applies
to all advertisements in all media, including online. The MAP restriction only applies
to advertised prices and not to the price at which products are actually sold. In
physical stores, this means that the posted price in the store is not affected by the
MAP restriction. As regards online pricing the policy states:
Pricing listed on an internet site is considered an “advertised price”
and must adhere to the MAP policy. Once the pricing is associated with
an actual purchase (an internet order), the price becomes the selling price
and is not bound by this MAP policy. Statements such “we will match
any price”, and “call for price” are acceptable.
In particular, such policies allow retailers to advise customers that they will be
able to see the price when the item is in a (digital) shopping basket.
Lastly, Samsung reserves the right to punish non-compliance with termination.7
This paper adds to the nascent literature (notably Janssen and Shelegia (2015)
and Lubensky (2014)) that examines the effects of vertical contracts when the final
goods market is characterized by search frictions. In particular, in such markets
it has long been understood that the law of one price need not hold, and price
dispersion may arise.8 Naturally, such frictions have implications for the contracts
between manufacturer and retailer and for a manufacturer’s profitability. A minimum
advertised price restriction (MAP) which limits the price that retailers may advertise
(with no restriction on the price they may charge) can make it more difficult for
consumers to find the retailers charging the lowest prices and lead to retail price

Interestingly, the policy also describes its purpose, which in this instance is to “to help ensure
the legacy of STA as a top producer of high performance, high quality, professional security products
and to protect the reputation of its name and products ...[and]... to ensure dealers, retailers and
distributors have the incentive to invest resources into services for STA’s customers.”.

This idea goes back to Stigler (1961) at least. Baye, Morgan and Scholten (2006) provide a
useful overview.

dispersion (if not advertised price dispersion). As is illustrated in this paper, a
manufacturer (and even consumers) may benefit.
The paper also contributes to the large and growing literature on obfuscation
in search markets. (See, for example, Ellison and Wolitzky (2012), Wilson (2010),
Piccione and Spiegler (2012), Chioveanu and Zhou (2013)).9 Much of the economic
force of a MAP restriction is through making firms identical from the point of view
of consumers. In this way, MAP plays a role in obfuscating the actual as opposed to
advertised price (indeed this is its only role in our analysis). This paper is distinct
from the rest of the obfuscation literature (to our knowledge) by explicitly considering
the opportunities obfuscation gives to an upstream manufacturer, as opposed to a
retailer.
Only four papers, that we know of, consider MAP policies in the economic literature. Kali (1998) and Cetinkaya (2009) explore theoretical models that treat MAP as
an RPM provision with an additional advertising subsidy. A very different approach
is adopted in this paper. Charness and Chen (2002) conduct an experimental study
of the determinants of MAP compliance. Israeli, Anderson and Coughlan (forthcoming) empirically examine detected violations of MAP, using data from a firm engaged,
on behalf of manufacturers, in monitoring MAP compliance of online retailers. They
also provide an informative discussion of MAP’s prevalence.10 Importantly for our
study, Israeli et al find that 14-22% of authorized dealers violate MAP, as compared
to 46-54% of unauthorized dealers. This suggests that MAP policies are genuine
restraints on retailer behavior.
Lastly, this paper contributes to the well established literature, in policy and
academic circles, on the antitrust implications of vertical contracts.11 Where MAP
provisions have been considered in this literature, the point of departure (as in this
paper) has been RPM restrictions. As with many vertical restraints, the approach
to MAP and RPM taken in US and European law differs, with the E.U. being
the less permissive. In 2007 in the Leegin case federal U.S. law reversed earlier
precedent, shifting RPM from a complicated version of a per se offense to a rule
of reason regime.12 Even prior to the Leegin case, US law had ruled in favor of
MAP provisions, acknowledging their pro-competitive potential in preserving service
9

More broadly, recent literature has explored retailers’ policies which influence search and pricing
behavior in search markets. Such practices include stochastic discounts off the list price in Gill
and Thanassoulis (forthcoming), lowest price guarantees in Janssen and Parakhonyak (2013), and
exploding offers in Armgstrong and Zhou (2016).

The data used in Israeli et al comes from a firm offering MAP compliance monitoring of internet
based sellers.

incentives.13 Post-Leegin cases in the U.S. have also failed to gain traction.
By contrast, in Europe, MAP provisions have tended to be viewed with more
suspicion. In particular, MAP has been found to be a de facto form of RPM.14 In
turn, RPM has been found to impose a sufficient degree of harm to competition that
there is no need to examine its effects in determining liability (that is, making it an
restriction of competition by object, somewhat similar to a per se offense in U.S.
law).15
Hence, jurisdictions differ in their approach to regulating MAP provisions. This
paper contributes to understanding this divergence by providing the precise frameworks needed to make economic arguments supporting each approach. By doing so it
helps clarify the trade-offs implicit in arriving at any policy position vis-a-vis MAP.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the common
modeling approach used in all models. Of particular importance is Subsection 2.3,
which summarizes the timing and describes the equilibrium concept applied in the
rest of the paper. Section 3 explores the price discrimination model. Section 4
investigates how MAP can enhance customer service. Section 5 shows how a MAP
program can help coordinate a manufacturer cartel. Lastly, Section 6 offers some
final remarks.

in price advertising and demand increasing service. Consumers have search costs,
which makes the service and price advertising helpful. In what follows the common structure of the modeling framework is explained in detail, together with the
specific parameterizations used to consider the impact of MAP policies on i) price
discrimination, ii) retailer service and iii) manufacturer collusion.

2.1

Consumers

Let there be a unit mass of potential consumers. Consumer i purchasing from Retailer
j derives utility from consumption given by v(q) + ξj + εi .17 In each of the models,
we simplify this general structure:
1. In the price discrimination model, ξj = 0, εi ∈ {l, h} and are i.i.d. with
Pr(εi = l) = λ. Moreover, consumers have unit demand; that is, v(q ≥ 1) = v
and 0 otherwise.
2. In the service model, εi = ξj = 0. Here consumers do not have unit demand;
instead, v ′ (q) > 0, v ′′ (q) < 0, 0 < v ′ (0) ≤ v. This implicitly defines a demand
curve q(p) with standard properties for a consumer who decides to purchase at
a price p.
3. In the collusion model, εi = 0, ξj ∼i.i.d U [0, 1]; consumers have unit demand.
Minimum advertised prices only have bite if there are limits on the ability of
consumers to freely compare different retailers’ prices. We model these in a simple
(albeit fairly standard) way. Specifically, some fraction of consumers can search
costlessly, and others have sufficiently high search costs that, if observing the same
advertised price at both retailers, they will choose one at random.18 That is, they visit
only one retailer and, from the point of view of these consumers, advertised prices
are the only point of differentiation between retailers. We write σx to denote the
proportion of consumers, with εi = x, that search both retailers, with the remainder
searching only a single retailer. It is immediate that MAP can play no role if σx = 1
∀x. Therefore, we assume throughout at least for some x, σx < 1. Indeed, to
17

As one would expect: (i) v(q) ≥ 0 ∀q; and (ii) Net utility is v(q) + ξj + εi − p.
This is an extreme but convenient, and often-used, way to examine search frictions and consumers who are heterogeneous in their search behavior. See, for example, Varian (1980). Alternatively, an ex-ante costly decision to engage in search in the style of Burdett and Judd (1983) would
allow the fraction of searchers to be endogenously determined (at the cost of additional notation
for these search costs, and a somewhat more involved analysis).
18

highlight the role of these non-searchers, in the service and collusions models we set
σx = 0 for all values for εi = x. That is, in these models, consumers only visit one
store. However, the distinction and associated notation plays a crucial role in the
price discrimination model.

2.2

Firms

The two retailers are denoted R1 and R2 . The marginal cost of retailing for a retailer,
cj , takes on a value in {cL , cH }. We write Pr(cj = cH ) = αj ∈ [0, 1]. Costs are ordered
such that 0 = cL ≤ cH . Specific model parameters are:
1. In the price discrimination model of Section 3, α1 = 0, α2 = 1.
2. In the service model of Section 4, α1 = α2 = α ∈ (0, 1).
3. In the collusion model of Section 5, α1 = α2 = 0 (or, equivalently, cH = cL ).
Although the retailers may be heterogeneous, it is assumed that the manufacturer
offers the retailers identical terms. Where these retailers differ in their cost realizations, we assume that they are indistinguishable to consumers, and either they are
indistinguishable to the manufacturer or the manufacturer is restricted from discriminating between them.19
Retailers may engage in two activities supporting sales. The first is the provision
of service that improves consumers’ awareness of the product. This can be thought
of as informative non-price advertising, or simply ‘service’. We suppose that service
provision plays no role in the price discrimination and collusion models; instead all
consumers are aware of the product.20 Clearly it plays a role in the service model,
as we discuss in Section 4.
The second activity is price advertising. A retailer’s advertised retail price is
denoted paj . We assume that this is flexible, and so paj is set contemporaneously with
the retailers’ transaction price. We make the following assumption throughout the
paper. It ensures that the advertised price is not simply cheap talk.
A1. Advertising cannot be fraudulent in the following sense: the advertising price
can be no lower than the retail transaction price pj , i.e. paj ≥ pj .
19

This may be due to legal restrictions, or simply induced by the timing assumptions below.
In an extension of the price discrimination model, we allow for a “simple” service model with
a discrete decision so that the service level can take on two values—‘off’ and ‘on’. Further, we
suppose that service by both retailers is necessary for consumers to be aware of the product.
20

7

Retailers buy the product from a manufacturer (M ) according to a two-part tariff
with linear wholesale price w and fixed fee T .21 In the absence of vertical restrictions,
retailers take the wholesale price w as given and set the retail transaction price
and advertised price. If manufacturers impose point RPM, retailers are bound to
charge the RPM price, pRP M = paj = pj . Similarly, minimum and maximum RPM
imposes constraints such that pRP M ≤ pj ≤ paj and pRP M ≥ paj ≥ pj , respectively.
If manufacturers impose MAP, retailers are bound to advertise at the MAP price or
higher, pM AP ≤ paj .
The manufacturer’s marginal cost is equal to zero.
Thus far, it has been assumed that there is only one manufacturer. The collusion model deviates from this structure and considers two manufacturers. Each
manufacturer uses a single retailer. Manufacturers do not share retailers. Given this
structure, manufacturers and retailers both share the same subscript, such that Rj
provides retail service to Mj .
Each model assumes complete information, with the following exceptions:
1. Retailer costs are private information to the retailer. These are realized after
contracts are agreed.22
2. In the collusion model, wj is only observed by Mj and Rj . ξj is only observed
by (all) consumers and Rj .

2.3

Timing and Equilibrium

Lastly all models share a common timing structure, as follows.
1. The manufacturer sets the contract terms (T, w) and any restraints (RPM,
MAP etc.).
2. Retailers accept or reject the offered contract.
3. Retailer cost realizations occur, as do realizations of ξj and εi , these are privately observed by retailers and consumers respectively.
4. Retailers each decide on a service level, denoted sj .
21

Since we assume that the manufacturer cannot distinguish between retailers, there are no jsubscripts on these variables to denote different retailers.
22
This assumption only has bite in the service model, since costs are deterministic in the price
discrimination and collusion model.

8

5. Retailers each set their price, pj , and advertised price, paj , subject to any vertical
restraints.
6. Consumers sort into exploring purchases from R1 or R2 . In particular, they
choose to visit the retailer where they expect greatest surplus (as long as the
expected surplus is non-negative); if indifferent, they are equally likely to visit
either retailer.
7. Purchases are made and profits realized.
In the collusion model, this constitutes the stage game within a repeated game
setting (described further in Section 5).
We conclude by discussing our equilibrium concept and introduce some simple
and intuitive results that characterize equilibrium play in the subgame beginning
at step 5 above, in which retailers set pj and paj . In essence, it ensures that the
homogenous-good Bertrand structure of price competition between retailers carries
over to the price advertising game considered here. Given that some consumers can
visit only a single retailer, beliefs as to pj given paj need to be considered. This
results in the relevant equilibrium concept being (a refinement of) perfect Bayesian
equilibrium.
We introduce the following definitions.
Definition 1 Consumers’ beliefs are monotone if, ∀paj > pbaj , E(pj |paj ) > E(pj |b
paj ).
Definition 2 A monotone perfect Bayesian equilibrium is a perfect Bayesian
equilibrium in which consumers’ beliefs are monotone.

In principle, there is considerable flexibility in assigning off-equilibrium beliefs
and, thereby, inducing perverse equilibrium behavior. However, Assumption A1
specifies that a retailer cannot advertise a price below the price that it charges
imposes real constraints. For example, suppose that a retailer charging a price of $4
or charging a price of $6 were expected to advertise the same price. The advertised
price would have to be a price at or above $6 to conform with this restriction.
Suppose that this advertised price is $20 and that these are the only two kinds
of retailer expected to advertise at $20 in equilibrium. Then consumers expect on
average some price above $4 (if it was equally likely that retailers charge $4 and
$6, consumers anticipate $5 on average).23 Suppose that the retailer charging $4
23

Recall that retailers are indistinguishable to consumers, so that if paj = pak then E(pj |paj ) =
E(pk |pak ).

9

instead of advertising a price of $20 advertises a price of $4. Given the restriction
that retailers cannot advertise at prices below what they charge, it must be that
consumers even if this is an off-equilibrium advertised price anticipate paying a price
below $4; it follows that this advertised price attracts more consumers, as their
expected surplus must be strictly greater, and hence would be more profitable.24
When there are no advertising restrictions, the simple logic in the example above
has considerable bite. The following result establishes that there is no loss in supposing that retailers will advertise the price that they actually charge.25
Lemma 1 Suppose that there are no advertising restrictions, then any perfect Bayesian
equilibrium is equivalent to one in which each retailer sets its advertised price equal
to its actual price i.e. paj = pj ∀j.
Proof. See the appendix.
Note that, since perfect Bayesian equilibria allow for considerable flexibility on
off-equilibrium beliefs, it is immediate that monotone perfect Bayesian where paj = pj
can be constructed.
In case of advertising restrictions, a retailer may not be able to set the advertised
price equal to its actual price. Moreover, when the MAP price is high, the logic
in the example above that underlies Lemma 1 has little bite. Returning to the
example above, suppose that there was a MAP price of $10, and consumers expected
that retailers advertising a price of $20 were equally likely to actually charge $6 or
$4, supported by the (off-equilibrium) beliefs that any retailer advertising anything
between $10 and $20 actually charged $9. Here, since the MAP restriction prevents
the retailer charging $4 from advertising at a sufficiently low price, this retailer may
have little to gain from advertising at a price below $20. A focus on monotone perfect
Bayesian equilibrium rules out such perverse outcomes.26 Trivially the monotone
belief assumption leads retailers to advertise at as low as a price as possible. We
obtain the following result.
Lemma 2 In a MAP regime, in all monotone perfect Bayesian equilibria, each retailer advertises its actual price unless the MAP restriction binds, and in this case
it advertises the MAP price; i.e. paj = max pM AP , pj .
24

If, in equilibrium, competing retailers advertise and charge a price of $6, but the retailer of
interest has an actual price of $4, any advertised price in the interval [4, 6) is considered equivalent
to advertising a price of $4.
25
This logic does not pin down all advertised prices. In particular, suppose that in equilibrium
no retailer charges a price above $10, then if the retailer charging $10 is expected to advertise at
$20, it has no strict gain by advertising a price of $10 instead.
26
Again, flexibility regarding off-equilibrium beliefs allows such equilibria to be constructed.

10

Proof. See the appendix.
In all that follows, the focus is on monotone perfect Bayesian equilibria, and so,
following the two lemmas above, it is without loss to suppose that retailers advertise
their actual price, or the MAP price in the event that it binds.

MAP as price discrimination

MAP can facilitate price discrimination. That is, in the face of consumer preference
heterogeneity, MAP can be used to sort consumers among retailers in ways that
extract greater surplus than might otherwise be the case. This is because MAP by
preventing all consumers from searching amongst retailers costlessly can allow for
price dispersion. As noted by Salop (1977), an integrated monopolist would value
such price dispersion as it both segments the market and charges higher prices to less
efficient searchers. An appropriate MAP contract enables the manufacturer both to
allow for such price dispersion, and to extract the surplus that this creates in the
industry as a whole.
To illustrate this idea as simply as possible, we begin by abstracting from service
provision and suppose that consumers have unit demand with valuations equal to
either l or h. Specifically, a fraction (1 − λ) of consumers have a valuation equal to
h and the remainder have a valuation equal to l. In this section we suppose that one
retailer has costs equal to cL = 0 and the other cH ≥ 0.
With a two part-tariff, it is immediate that even without the use of vertical
restraints, the manufacturer can induce a retail price of h or a retailer price of l and
enjoy the full surplus of doing so.27 If industry profit is maximized by selling to all
consumers at p = l, by setting w = max{0, l − cH }, the manufacturer can induce the
retailer to set prices at p = l and set T to extract the remaining surplus from the
retailers. Conversely, if industry profit is maximized by selling to only high value
consumers, all surplus can be extracted by the manufacturer (for example, by setting
p = h and T = 0). Thus, the manufacturer’s profit is equal to max {l, (1 − λ)h}.
Note that RPM does not provide an avenue through which to raise profits above this
level.
However, the addition of MAP to this environment may allow for further surplus
extraction by the manufacturer. We illustrate this with a simple example.
Consider an environment in which σl = 1 and σh = 0, such that low value
consumers costlessly search both retailers, and the high value consumers will only

As is well understood, the use of a two-part rather than linear tariff allows the manufacturer
to overcome the familiar double-marginalization problem highlighted in Spengler (1950).

crucial, assume cH = cL = 0.

Consider the profit that a manufacturer that sets the MAP price at pM AP = h can
extract. It is clear that for MAP to be strictly profitable, it must lead one retailer
(denoted RH ) to charge a retail price equal to h and the other, RL , to set the retail
price to l.
Figure 1 illustrates this scenario (with λ = 0.5). Of the high value consumers, due
to the identical advertised price imposed by MAP and their inability to search, half
go to RH and half to RL . All the low value consumers (who are assumed to be able
to search costlessly between retailers) go to RL . Hence, the profit (ignoring T ) made
by RH is 12 (h − w)(1 − λ), the sum of rectangles A and B. Similarly, the profit made
by RL is (l − w)(λ + (1 − λ) 12 ), the diagonally hatched rectangle corresponding to the
sum of C and D. By setting w such that the two profits are equal, then using T , the
manufacturer can capture all the surplus other than area E. Assuming that this is
optimal policy for the manufacturer, it remains to show that this is an equilibrium
for the retailers.28
Remark 1 Let σl = 1, σh = 0, and cH = cL = 0. Suppose the manufacturer offers
(w, T ) and sets pM AP = h. A monotone perfect Bayesian equilibrium in which both
28

Depending on parameters, the manufacturer may do better by setting w = h, and only selling
to high value consumers. This will be the case if rectangle E is bigger than D + G (= λl) at the
optimum. Retailer equilibrium if w = h is trivial.

If this equilibrium exists, it is unique if Conditions 1 and 2 are strict inequalities.
The optimal MAP policy sets w∗ , such that Condition 2 holds with equality, and T ∗
such that (h − w)(1 − λ) 12 − T ∗ = 0.
Proof. See the appendix.
It is easy to find parameterizations such that this equilibrium exists and this
discriminatory pricing policy is optimal for the manufacturer, as shown in Example
1, below.
Example 1 Let σl = 1, σh = 0, cH = cL = 0, h = 2, l = 1 and λ = 0.5. The
conditions in Remark 1 are satisfied when (w, T ) = ( 12 , 38 ) and pM AP = 2. Further,
the manufacturers profit from this pricing scheme is 1.25. The profit from a two part
tariff, absent MAP, is 1. Thus, the MAP policy, in this example, leads to strictly
greater profit for the manufacturer.
All price discrimination operates by (usually imperfectly) homogenizing consumers so that targeted prices extract more surplus.29 The MAP policies explored
here are no exception. By introducing an information friction, the manufacturer is
able to isolate at least some of the high value consumers and extract surplus from
them via the high price charged by RH . By contrast, RPM does little to segregate consumers and so serves only to solve a possible double margin problem (which
arises if T is restricted to 0). This illustrates the sense in which MAP has elements
analogous to the much more invidious market division schemes that invite criminal
sanction under antitrust laws, while RPM is similarly analogous to price fixing.30
Merely agreeing on a common price does not help retailers, in this setting, to extract
29
Sometimes the emphasis is tilted toward better targeting the prices (in the extreme, Type 1
price discrimination), while other times the emphasis is on homogenizing the consumers (bundling,
and Type 3 price discrimination, being obvious examples).
30
To be clear, we do not argue that MAP and RPM should invite the same sanctions as market
division and price fixing. Indeed, as much of this paper shows, both often serve to make markets
more efficient and more consumer friendly.

13

more surplus. However, if retailers could allocate high value consumers to RH and
low value consumers to RL , as might be done in some ideal market division scheme,
then they would be able to extract all available gains from trade. MAP generates
an imperfect implementation along these lines, albeit ultimately to the benefit of the
upstream manufacturer.31
Remark 2 Much as in the classic price discrimination literature (Adams and Yellen
(1976), Schmalensee (82, 84), McAfee et al (1989)) negative correlation between
valuation and search costs is not a necessary condition for this policy to work. If we
adjust Example 1 such that σl = σh = σ, it can be shown that profits from optimal
MAP-based pricing is given by 1 + σ(1−σ)
which will strictly dominate the non-MAP
3σ+1
profit, for σ ∈ (0, 1).
We finish the section with a general proposition characterizing the MAP-based
price discrimination scheme, and its optimality, for this environment.

Retailers play a (almost unique) monotone perfect Bayesian equilibrium in which
RL sets p = l and RH sets p = h.32 The solution of this program constitutes the optimal pricing policy for the manufacturer for a positive measure of parameter values.
31

Interestingly, contingent on IC constraints being satisfied, as more retailers are used in a market,
surplus extraction via MAP will approach perfect (type 1) price discrimination in this setting.
32
As in Remark 1, the equilibrium may not be unique if cH = 0 so that the firms may play
different roles in price setting.

14

Proof. The proof extends to the intuition developed in Remark 1. It is immediate
that the discriminatory MAP scheme should involve the retail prices set at l and h.
Since RH has higher marginal costs of production than RL , more industry profit is
generated when the RL sets a price of l (and sells a greater quantity) and RH sets a
price of h. As argued below, the manufacturer can ensure that this is the equilibrium
outcome.
The fixed fee is set to extract as much surplus as possible subject to both the low
cost retailer and high cost retailer being willing to take up the contract; that is, it is
equal to the minimum of their (gross of fixed) fee profits.
The manufacturer chooses the input price w∗ to maximize its profits.
The penultimate two inequalities at the end of the statement of the proposition
correspond to the incentive constraints that guarantee that the two retailers do not
wish to deviate from their equilibrium pricing strategies. The first ensures that the
low cost retailer prefers charging a price of l than a price of h, and the second that the
high cost retailer prefers charging a price of h to undercutting the low cost retailer
and attracting all searchers. The final inequality ensures that both retailers prefer
to make positive sales.
Note that in this section, given the simplicity of the set-up (where there are only
two types of consumers, each with unit-demand), the level of the price restriction
(as long as it is sufficiently high) plays no role. Instead, it could be considered as
analogous to a ban on advertising. In richer environments with downward-sloping
demand, the level of the advertising restriction can be used to affect the double
marginalization concern raised by Spengler (1950) in addition to allowing for the
kind of discrimination described in this section. As will become apparent, the level
of the advertising restriction plays a substantive role in the variants of the model
that we consider in Sections 4 and 5.

3.1

Price discrimination and simple service

We extend the model in Section 3, to allow for service in a simple way. Here, we
suppose that service is either ‘on’ or ‘off’.33 Moreover, both retailers need to provide
service for demand to be non-zero.34 Due to the ‘on’/‘off’ nature of service, retailers
incur a fixed cost of service of F . It is noteworthy that this service consideration
implies that MAP may be optimal for the manufacturer even when the manufacturer
33

This could correspond, for example, to a fixed cost to participate in the market.
This is an (extreme) way of capturing the free-riding effect explored in Matthewson and Winter
(1984) and many subsequent papers.
34

15

is restricted to linear tariffs.35
In this model of discrete service provision, where both retailers must be active,
the market breaks down in the absence of vertical restrictions. This is due to the
Bertrand competition between the retailers – at least one retailer will earn zero
profits, before any fixed costs are deducted, and hence, anticipating this outcome,
the high cost retailer has no incentive to provide service at cost F > 0. As a result,
there is no demand for the product, and the product is not offered to the market.

(c) Service with RPM when pRPM=l

Notes cL=cH=0, σl=1 and σh=0.

Panel (a) of Figure 2 illustrates how a price discrimination-based MAP program
can be used to generate service. Building on the model illustrated in Figure 1, Panel
(a) shows that, rather than capturing surplus using the lump-sum part of a two part
tariff, the manufacturer may leave surplus with the retailers and the retailers can use
this to fund service. That is, when the wholesale unit price is wM AP , the rectangles
with area F will be sufficient to provide service. The profit to the manufacturer
in Panel (a) is equal to w. Note that all customers get served and some consumer
surplus is generated for those high value consumers that find the low price retailer.
Panel (b) of Figure 2 illustrates the outcome when pRP M = h. Given a cost of
service F , the optimal wholesale unit price is equal to wM AP . This is easy to see, once
it is noted that the rectangles F in Panel (b) must be the same size as the rectangle
F in Panel (a).36 The key difference between Panel (b) and Panel (a) is that, while
35

This is immediate, if for example it happens to be that F = T ∗ (w∗ ) where T ∗ (w∗ ) is as
characterized in Proposition 1; but, of course, is true much more generally.
Instead, if F = 0 and the manufacturer is restricted to linear tariffs, it can be shown that the
manufacturer would never gain through the use of a MAP restriction.
36
It is also immediate from this observation that, in this model, if service can be provided under
MAP, there exists an RPM policy that will also induce service.

16

service is provided in both instances, in Panel (b) a quantity distortion exists. This
is, by virtue of MAP allowing more effective price discrimination, more consumers
are served under MAP than RPM. Further, some consumer surplus is generated
under MAP, but not when using RPM. Finally, the profit of the manufacturer using
RPM is half that obtained when using MAP (w is the same, but half the consumers
are served). Thus, MAP dominates RPM for both consumers and the manufacturer,
despite the fact that service is provided under both policies.
Panel (c) shows what happens when the optimal RPM policy is pRP M = l.37 Note
that wRP M < wM AP , since, under RPM, the retailers are sharing the entire market
at the low price: this means consumers have more surplus, and to give the retailer
sufficient rents to fund service, the manufacturer has to drop the wholesale unit price.
Thus, consumers are better off under RPM, service is provided under both RPM and
MAP, and no distortions exist. It still remains that, since wM AP > wRP M , the MAP
policy is the more profitable way for the manufacturer to provide service.
The dominance, from the point of view of the manufacturer, of MAP policies as
a way to incentivize service is not surprising, as it has been already established that,
in this setting, MAP is a superior method of surplus extraction. What is perhaps
more notable, is that when gains from trade are ‘low’, consumers also prefer MAP
policies to RPM, as MAP does not generate a quantity restriction.38
We end by providing a parametrized example in which the possibility results and
intuitions provided in this section are easily verified.
Example 2 Let σl = 1, σh = 0, cH = cL = 0, h = 1 + ǫ, l = ǫ and λ = 0.5. Let
F = 38 . For ǫ < 12 , neither RPM nor MAP will provide sufficient surplus to retailers
to induce
!  them to provide service and allow the manufacturer to make profits. For
ǫ ∈ 12 , 1 , the optimal RPM price is h, w = h − 4F and service is provided, but
only the high value consumers are served and a deadweight loss exists. By contrast,
with a MAP policy in which pM AP = h and w = h − 4F , all consumers are served,
and no deadweight loss occurs. Further, half the high value consumers receive some
consumer surplus. For ǫ > 1, there is no deadweight loss under either MAP or RPM,
service is provided and RPM generates the greater consumer surplus (pRP M = l). For
any ǫ > 12 the manufacturer’s profits from MAP will be strictly higher than that using
RPM.
37
38

This will occur after some point as h and l are increased by the same additive constant.
That is, when pRP M = h.

MAP and service provision

In this section, we develop the idea that a service component might lead a MAP
arrangement to be optimal, independently of the usefulness of MAP as a price discrimination device (as in Section 3.1).
In this section, we focus on retailer cost heterogeneity, and suppose that consumers are homogeneous. This shuts down price discrimination. To further homogenize consumers, and to highlight the role of search costs, we set σL = σH = 0. That
is, all consumers have high costs of search and so visit only one store. The model
is enriched, such that that consumers have downward-sloping, rather than unit, demand. This means that retailers with different marginal costs have different optimal
retail prices.
On the retailer side, we enrich the scope of service. Specifically, retailer j sets a
service level sj ∈ [0, 1] at cost I(sj ), which is continuously differentiable and increasing and I ′ (s) is sufficiently high that equilibrium investments are strictly less than 1.
Thus, service is now a continuous choice variable for each retailer. It acts to increase
consumer awareness of the product.39 A consumer that is aware of the product can
purchase from either retailer, as in Matthewson and Winter (1984). An investment of
sj will expose a measure of consumers of size sj to the product. The probability that
a consumer is exposed to the investment of one retailer is independent of whether
it is exposed to the other, so the total measure of consumers that are aware of the
product is equal to S = 1 − (1 − s1 )(1 − s2 ).
Finally, we suppose that each retailer’s marginal cost of retailing is independently
drawn from an ex ante known distribution. This marginal cost takes the value cH with
probability α, and is cL = 0 otherwise. Retailer costs remain private information;
that is, retailers do not know each others’ realizations.40 Note that that retailers’
cost are realized only after entering into contracts with the manufacturer. Hence, the
two-part tariff extracts surplus by setting the fixed fee equal to a retailer’s expected
net profit.41
This model shows how MAP can lead to pro-competitive service when the price
discrimination channel outlined above is not operative. That is, the focus is shifted
from MAP’s efficacy in leveraging consumer heterogeneity, to its efficacy in environments dominated by retailer heterogeneity.
39

As pointed out in Asker and Bar-Isaac (2014) service need not be pro-competitive, and (at least
in their model) can lead to exclusion when retailers are gatekeepers to a market. All the arguments
made in Asker and Bar-Isaac (2014) can be transferred to environments with MAP.
40
At a technical level, this provides ex post price dispersion, which is needed for RPM and MAP
to have a meaningful role.
41
This is implied by the timing in Section 2.

Profit for R2 is similarly defined.
In considering the equilibrium of the pricing subgame (stage 5 in the timing in
Section 2.3), note that this is a discrete analog to Spulber (1995) which points out
that Bertrand with privately known costs mirrors the equilibrium in a first price auction with risk aversion. Equilibrium of the pricing subgame then follows Proposition
2 in Spulber (1995) which is, itself, an adaptation of Theorem 2 in Maskin and Riley
(1984). Equilibrium pricing is characterized as follows.

Proposition 2 There exists a unique symmetric equilibrium pricing strategy such
that, for j ∈ {1, 2}:
1. if cj = cH , pH = w + cH
M
2. p = min{pH , pM
L (w)} where pL is the monopoly price a low cost retailer would
M
charge; i.e. pL = arg max(p − w)q(p)
!

3. p is implicitly defined by q(p) p − w = α(p − w)q(p)

4. if cj = 0, price (pL ) is drawn from the distribution FL (p) =
with the support [p, p).

(p−w)q(p)−α(p−w)q(p)
(1−α)(p−w)q(p)

Proof. See the appendix.
Next, we proceed by backward induction to consider the equilibrium of the investment subgame. Attention is restricted to symmetric equilibria where a retailer
with a low cost realization chooses an interior investment sL > 0. Note that given
the pricing equilibrium in Proposition 2; it is immediate that a high cost retailer
earns no (net of investment) profits and, therefore, that there is no investment at a
high cost realization; that is, sH = 0.
In choosing sL , each retailer solves the following problem (illustrated here for
Retailer 1):
max Es2 (S)π̃(cL ) − I(s1 )
(4)
s1

19

where E(S) = 1 − (1 − s1 )(1 − αsH − (1 − α) sL ) = 1 − (1 − s1 )(1 − (1 − α) sL )
and π̃(cL ) = α(p − w)q(p) (note, by construction, in the mixed strategy equilibrium
profits adjusted by the probability of winning is constant over p). This yields the
following best response function in the investment subgame that arises from the first
order condition:
(5)
I ′ (s1 (cL )) = (1 − (1 − α) sL )α(p − w)q(p).
By imposing symmetry, the equilibrium advertising levels are implicitly defined as
follows:42
I ′ (sL ) = (1 − (1 − α) sL )α(p − w)q(p).
(6)
Finally, we can turn to the problem of the manufacturer. The manufacturer sets
T equal to a retailer’s expected profits so that
T = (1 − α) [(1 − (1 − sL )(1 − (1 − α) sL ))α(p − w)q(p) − I(sL )] ,
where this expression follows on noting that only the low cost retailer earns profits and expected size of market and expected profits per customer follow from the
expressions that appear below (4). The manufacturer chooses w to maximize:

where the term in square brackets corresponds to expected sales. To understand this
term, first note that when both retailers have high costs then there is no investment
in advertising and so there are no sales; with probability 2α(1 − α) there is just one
low cost retailer,
a mass of sL consumers aware of the product and each consumer
Rp
purchases p q(p)fL (p)dp in expectation; finally the second term inside the square
brackets describes the event in which both retailers get low cost realizations. When
both retailers are low cost, consumers aware of the product will purchase from the
lower of two price drawn independently from FL (.); thus, the final integral reflects
the expected quantity corresponding to a price distributed as the second order static
of FL (.).

4.2

RPM

From the perspective of the manufacturer, resale price maintenance can strictly improve on the outcome with no restraints. The channels that allow this are standard.
42

Imposing specific functional forms allows for a closed form solution, for example when I(s) =
α(p−w)q(p)
then sL = 1+(1−α)α(p−w)q(p)
.

First, minimum RPM can soften price competition between retailers, and hence, by
allowing the retailers higher expected profits, can induce greater investment. For
example, consider the case where α is close to 0, so that both retailers are almost
certainly low cost retailers. Retailer (net) profits, and hence advertising investments,
would be negligible. In this case, a minimum RPM provision that guaranteed retailers some net profits and induce some investment would clearly help induce service.
Second, retail prices (for retailers with low cost realizations) may be too high due
to a standard double mark-up problem; maximum RPM can help solve this. Here,
the focus is on the case of a binding minimum RPM, set at a level denoted by P ,
reflecting the need for service.43
First, note that if minimum RPM is binding for both high and low cost retailers,
the retail price (regardless of the retailers’ cost realizations) is given by P . Instead, if
the restriction is binding only for retailers with low cost realizations, then the pricing
equilibrium is as follows:
Proposition 3 Suppose that the minimum RPM price is P < w + cH (so that it
does not bind given a high cost realization) but binds given the low cost realization,
there exists a unique symmetric equilibrium pricing strategy such that for j ∈ {1, 2}:
1. if cj = cH , pH = w + cH
2. pmin = min{cH + w, pM
L (w)}
3. for p < pmin , Fmin P (p) is characterized by α(pmin − w)q(pmin ) = q(p)(p − w)(α +
(1 − α)(1 − Fmin P (p))
h
Fmin P (pmin )
4. pmin is implicitly defined by q(P )(P − w) α + (1 − α)
2
i
+ (1 − α)(1 − Fmin P (pmin )) = q(pmin )(pmin − w)(α + (1 − α)(1 − Fmin P (pmin ))
5. if cj = 0, and pmin < pmin then price (pL ) is drawn from the distribution
Fmin P (p) with support P ∪ (pmin , pmin ) and an atom at P
6. if cj = 0, and pmin ≥ pmin then pL = P with probability 1.
Proof. See the appendix.
43

While the double margin issues are not the primary focus, it should be noted that the problem
is limited by pH = w + cH .

21

The characterization of the pricing equilibrium suggests that in case the optimal
minimum RPM induces price dispersion, it cannot aid the manufacturer through
inducing service provision.44
Corollary 1 Suppose that the minimum RPM price is P < w + cH (so that it does
not bind given a high cost realization) and that a low cost retailer plays a mixed
strategy in pricing, then the level of investment in service is identical to the level of
investment in the absence of RPM or any other restrictions—that is the solution to
(4).
Proof. This is immediate on noting that a retailer with a high cost realization
makes no net profits and that pmin = p so that a retailer’s profit per aware consumer
is identical to the case of no restrictions, so that the low cost retailer faces the
identical maximization problem (4) in its choice of investment in service.
It follows that RPM can only play a role in inducing service provision in one
of two cases (i) either it binds for both low and high cost realizations; that is, if
P > w + cH ; or (ii) it leads a firm with a low cost realization to choose P with
certainty (which requires pmin > pmin as defined in Proposition 3). We provide a
complete characterization of the manufacturer’s problem with RPM, analogous to
our analysis of the case with no restrictions, above, in Appendix B. Here, it is worth
noting that in the former case, where both high and low cost firms set a price equal
)
to P > w + cH , demand for a retailer irrespective of its costs is given by q(P
. Service
2
for low cost and high cost realization can be easily implicitly characterized through
the first order conditions as follows:
q(P )
(P − w), and
2
q(P )
(P − w − cH ).
I ′ (sH (P )) = (1 − αsH − (1 − α) sL )
2
I ′ (sL (P )) = (1 − αsH − (1 − α) sL )

(7)
(8)

Note that these equations must be satisfied simultaneously; in comparison, in the
case of no restrictions solving for a high cost retailer’s investment is trivial which
allows for a simple characterization of a low cost retailer’s investment in (5). In particular, investment by the high cost and low cost retailers are strategic substitutes.45
44

Interestingly, minimum RPM (and not only maximum RPM) can play a role in affecting “double
mark-up” concerns by changing the price distribution and so may still dominate no restriction from
the manufacturer’s perspective even if it has no impact on service provision.
45
For specific parameterizations unique closed form solutions are assured. For example, for
2
(P −w)q(P )
(P −w−c)q(P )
quadratic investment costs I(s) = s2 , sL (P ) = 2+(P
−w−αc)q(P ) and sH (P ) = 2+(P −w−αc)q(P ) .

22

It is straightforward to find instances where the manufacturer might benefit from
imposing such a price restriction; in particular, this will be the case for α close to 0
or 1.
Summarizing the discussion above, we obtain Proposition 4.
Proposition 4 Minimum RPM set at P can strictly improve the manufacturer’s
profits relative to the case of no restrictions in the case of smooth advertising investments. It can only do so through raising retailers’ advertising investments when it
leads retailers to choose pure pricing strategies.
Proof. See the appendix.

4.3

MAP

MAP can have the benefit of the minimum RPM scheme described above in dulling
competition between retailers and allowing them higher profits, thereby encouraging
investment in advertising. However, MAP has the benefit that it allows some retailers
to drop actual price below the advertised minimum. The reason that they may want
to do this is that their monopoly price may be below the MAP price. Moreover, this
can be in the interest of the manufacturer as it increases the sales per customer for
customers who are aware relative to the minimum RPM policy, and can increase the
low cost retailer’s level of investment and the overall number of customers aware of
the product.
Specifically, MAP at the MAP price P plays a role that might be different from
RPM when the high cost retailer charges this price, and the low cost retailer charges
a different (lower) price.46 It is clear that the low cost retailer would charge pm (w)
m
which maximizes q(p 2(w)) (pm (w) − w).
Under MAP, half of the consumers who are aware of the good purchase from either
retailer (irrespective of its costs), since the retailers advertise the same price. These
consumers then respond to the price that they observe at the retailer. Consequently,
service for low cost and high cost realization can be easily implicitly characterized
46

At a sufficiently high MAP price, both a high cost retailer and a low cost retailer would charge
a lower price than the MAP price. However, since a high cost retailer’s price can be predicted—it
is simply its monopoly price (given w)—the manufacturer could set the MAP price at this level.
Consequently, it is without loss of generality to suppose that the MAP price is always binding for
a high cost retailer in equilibrium. For expositional simplicity we assume P ≤ pM
H (w).

23

through the first order conditions as follows:47
q(pm (w)) m
(p (w) − w), and
2
q(P )
I ′ (sH (P )) = (1 − αsH − (1 − α) sL )
(P − w − cH ).
2
I ′ (sL (P )) = (1 − αsH − (1 − α) sL )

(9)
(10)

These differ from the equations that characterize investment under RPM at the
same price P , in (7) and (8) since the low cost retailer sells at a price pm (w) rather
than P and sells q(pm (w)) to each consumer who arrives at the retailer rather than
q(P ). Given that retailers’ investments are strategic substitutes, this affects the
equilibrium investments of both retailers. Thus, although greater investment from
a low cost retailer might be anticipated as a result of the imposition of MAP, a
consequence would be a force that dampens the high cost retailer. As for the case of
no restrictions, the manufacturer optimally T equal to a retailer’s expected profits
and chooses w to maximize expected profits. A formal treatment can be found in
Appendix B.
We argue that the different economics of MAP as compared to RPM, by allowing
the low cost retailer to charge a lower price than the MAP price, lead to higher
industry profits and more effective investments. We do so both by example and in
the Proposition below.
Proposition 5 When investment in service take any value in [0, 1], MAP can earn
M strictly higher profits than minimum RPM. When investment costs are sufficiently
convex or if the firm is unlikely to be low cost (α is high enough), then MAP can
never earn less than minimum RPM.
Proof. Suppose that the optimal min RPM involves a two-part tariff (T, w) and
the level of the price minimum at P . Rather than considering the optimal MAP
scheme, suppose that MAP is imposed at P and with a wholesale price of w, it is
immediate that a retailer with a high cost realization would choose a retail price
equal to P . However, it is possible that the monopoly price for a retailer with a
low cost realization is below P . In this case, under MAP, a retailer with a low cost
realization would charge this monopoly price pm
L (w) = arg max(p − w)q(p) < P .
This potentially affects M ’s profits in several ways:
First, through sales directly, by increasing the sales per aware consumer (since a
low cost retailer charges a lower price). Secondly, it affects sales by changing retailers’

investments: Holding fixed the service level of a high cost retailer, it is clear that
a lower cost retailer would invest more. However, the higher investment of a low
cost retailer reduces a high cost retailer’s gains from investment, as discussed below
Equation (10). Overall, the combined effect is ambiguous. With sufficiently convex
costs (or high α), the effects on the low cost retailer’s investment is negligible leading
to a positive overall effect on profits.
Finally, there is an effect through a (potentially) higher fixed fee T M AP which
might also reflect different service levels and so, in principle, the sign of the effect
might be ambiguous. Again, when the investment cost function is sufficiently convex
or α high enough, the impact on service levels is small, so that this effect is also
positive. Thus, overall M ’s profits rise.
Finally, to easily observe that it indeed possible to have pm
L (w) < P and, thereby,
prove the first statement of the proposition, consider a case where α is close to 1 and
c H > pm
L (0).
It is worth noting that MAP may under-perform RPM from the perspective of the
manufacturer. This is (trivially) the case when all consumers can search costlessly
(σl = σh = 1) and MAP serves no useful function.
That said, the earlier Example 2 and Example 3, below, which provides a numerical counterpoint to Proposition 5, make it clear that settings do exist in which,
by allowing for greater investment in efficient service and simultaneously allowing
more sales to realized, MAP can be pro-competitive (whether judged on a consumer
surplus or total surplus criterion).
Example 3 Let q(p) = 1 − p, α = 0.9 and cH = 0.4. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the optimal polices in the no restrictions, RPM and MAP cases. MAP
generates the highest consumer and total surplus, and the highest expected manufacturer and retailer profits.48

MAP and collusion

Vertical restrictions, and RPM in particular, have long been regarded as potentially
collusive mechanisms. That is, the binding of retailers, by the manufacturer, to a
common price, can look, at first glance, like a price fixing agreement.49 In the modern

era, the concern that RPM facilitates collusion continues to shape policy, supported
by research, most notably the central contribution of Jullien and Rey (2007).50 Jullien and Rey (2007) demonstrate that RPM facilitates collusion by making deviations
more transparent, at the cost of reducing responsiveness to local idiosyncratic demand fluctuations.51,52 In the analysis below, it is shown that MAP can similarly
soften competition, again by inducing demand patterns akin to a market division
scheme, without reducing responsiveness to local market demand fluctuations. This
results in MAP facilitating a more profitable and stable cartel.
The idea can been seen heuristically in the following simple example. Two manufacturers sell to a market via dedicated (non-shared) retailers. Consider a market
in which there is always a high value consumer who would pay h. In addition,
with probability µ, there is an additional consumer who has a low valuation l. This
additional consumer is local to one of the two manufacturers’ retailers (with equal
50

Jullien and Rey (2007) provide a formal foundation for ideas that have existed, albeit in only
heuristic form, since at least Telser (1960) and Yamey (1954).
51
Julien and Rey (2007) note other elements of the tradeoff, notably that RPM can make punishment more severe.
52
In a recent paper Sugaya and Wolitzky (2016) highlight that even costless transparency might
not always be beneficial for sustaining a cartel; although in many standard settings it is.

26

probability). That is with probability 1 − µ there is only a high value consumer, and
with probability (µ/2) there is also a low value consumer available to manufacturer
1 and with probability (µ/2) a low value consumer available to manufacturer 2. Suppose that 2l > h so that if a low value consumer is available, the industry would earn
higher profits by selling to both consumers than to the high value consumer alone.53
Jullien and Rey (2007) argue that RPM allows the manufacturers to more easily
monitor compliance with a collusive scheme at the cost of less responsiveness to
demand (or cost shocks). In the simple environment outlined above, RPM does
not help manufacturers collude (with this simple unit demand specification, the
manufacturers can agree on a common (high) retail price by setting w1 = w2 = h),
and observing retail prices allows manufacturers to monitor their compliance with
this scheme. MAP accommodates heterogeneity in this case by allowing for responses
to local demand shocks but without intensifying competition (since, for a retailer,
there is always a 50% chance of selling to the high value consumer and if there is
a low cost consumer then the relevant retailer will want to sell to him and does
so). Hence, here, MAP can increase the scope for collusion relative to no vertical
arrangements or, indeed, relative to RPM.
In what follows we embed this logic in a formal model that builds on the Jullien
and Rey (2007) framework. The modeling objective is to allow price advertising to
have an explicit role in the market, while retaining tractability and the economic
forces illustrated in Jullien and Rey (2007). The resulting framework is one in which
RPM facilitates a more stable cartel (in the sense of admitting collusion for a wider
range of discount rates than a cartel without restraints), at the cost of flexibility.
MAP, by contrast, can facilitate a yet more stable cartel, and does not sacrifice
flexibility, leading to higher cartel profits.

5.1

Model details

All model details are in Section 2. The essential elements are provided here for
convenience. There are two manufacturers, each of whom distributes to the local
market via a dedicated (non-shared) retailer. In this section, we suppose that consumers have unit demand and value retailer Rj ’s good at v + ξj , where ξj ∼ U [0, 1] is
a manufacturer-retailer specific demand shock reflecting idiosyncratic local market
factors. It follows that consumers will choose to visit retailer Rj if
!

(11)
v + ξj − E pj |paj ≥ 0
53

Note that this also implies that each manufacturer would rather sell with certainty at a price l
than sell at a price of h with probability (1/2).

27

and

!

v + ξj − E pj |paj > v − ξk − E (pk |pak )

(12)

The first inequality reflects that the consumer must expect non-negative surplus,
and the second that the consumer expects greater surplus from visiting Rj than Rk .
If the first inequality holds and the second condition holds with equality, then we
suppose that the consumer purchases from whichever retailer offers a higher ξ. To
keep exposition simple, σ = 0 so consumers visit at most only one store (search costs
are high).
Furthermore, we suppose that ξj is not observed by any manufacturer nor by the
rival retailer; it is only privately observed by Rj after contracting with the manufacturer and before setting the retail price. Each manufacturer sells to its dedicated
retailer using a two-part tariff {wj , Tj } (which are not publicly observed).54 Lastly,
v > 1, which ensures that wj is always set such that all ξj realizations are served.
Advertised prices are observed by all—including rival manufacturers.

5.2

Collusion with no vertical restrictions

With no vertical restraints, deriving the equilibrium of this game is somewhat involved. Here we sketch the elements, and provide a characterization that is fleshed
out in the appendix. Many of the details follow the underlying logic in Jullien and
Rey (2007), albeit applied to a different demand system. Once characterized, collusion in the absence of vertical restraints provides a benchmark against which to
compare the much simpler RPM- and MAP-facilitated schemes.
We begin by presenting a preliminary result that will prove useful. Specifically,
we begin by examining the pricing game between retailers, supposing (as will turn
out to be the case in equilibrium) that manufacturers choose the same input price;
that is, supposing that w1 = w2 = w. In this case, the pricing game between retailers
is a minor variant on the standard IPV symmetric first price sealed bid auction in
which each retailer solves:
pj = arg

max

w≤p≤v+ξj

(p − w) Pr (ξj − p > ξk − pk )

(13)

Equilibrium pricing is stated in Proposition 6 and derived following the steps in, for
instance, Krishna (2002).
54

These assumptions reflect those in Julien and Rey (2007). The assumptions on ξj give a reason
to give some pricing discretion to the retailer. The assumptions on {wj , Tj } make the cartel’s
monitoring of compliance non-trivial (and keeps IR constraints relatively simple).

28

Proposition 6 Assume that wj = wk = w. In a monotone perfect Bayesian equiξ
librium, paj = pj = w + 2j − w−v
1v<w .
2
Proof. See the appendix.
Proposition 6 means that if w = 0, as would arise in the static version of the
ξ
game, then retailers price using the rule pj = 2j . That is, prices fluctuate by half
the actual fluctuations in local demand. The retailers’ expected profit, which is then
transferred to the manufacturer through the fixed fee, Tj , is equal to the expectation
ξj2
,
2

which is 16 .55
Instead, the manufacturer-optimal scheme in this setting involves both manufacturers setting w = v and T = 16 . That is, the manufacturers set w as high as possible
without excluding any consumers,56 and then retailers compete accounting for idiosyncratic market conditions.57 The manufacturers extract the remaining expected
surplus from retailers using the lump sum component of the two part tariff.
In a collusive outcome, this scheme is enforced using a variant of a grim trigger
strategy, in which manufacturers set wt = v if all past advertised pricing has been in
the interval [v, v + 12 ], and wt = 0 otherwise. This results in an expected per period
collusive profit, for each manufacturer, of v2 + 16 . The characterization is complicated
by the fact that determining the optimal deviation is not immediate. In particular, if
a manufacturer charges a slightly lower wholesale price in some period t, because of
the local demand ξj demand variations, this may lead to only a marginal gain but will
have only a marginal probability of detection. Alternatively, a manufacturer might
prefer a more drastic deviation that leads to a substantive gain albeit at the cost
of a higher probability of detection. These two forms of deviation can, in principle,
lead to two locally optimal deviations, which then need to be compared. Full details
appear in the appendix.58 The following proposition provides the lower bound on the
discount factor, δ, required for this collusive scheme to be supportable in equilibrium.

5.3

Collusion with RPM

When RPM is available, the manufacturers can set the price at which the retailers
sell to customers. As discussed in Section 2, this will also be the advertised price.
The value of RPM is that it removes any uncertainty on the part of the cartel
members as to whether there has been a deviation or not, albeit at the expense of
losing some flexibility in adjusting to local market conditions (that is, adjusting for ξj
realizations). Thus, collusion can now take the form: Set wt = pRP M = v if the same
advertised pricing has been observed in all past periods, and wt = 0 otherwise.59
Proposition 8 describes this much simpler, collusive environment.

Collusion with MAP

Collusion, facilitated by MAP, involves coordinating on the advertised price, but allowing the transaction price (as usual under MAP) to only be constrained to be less
than or equal to that advertised price. The value of this to the colluding manufacturers is that it obfuscates pricing in the market for consumers, effectively introducing
a form of market division, while retaining flexibility on the part of consumers to
adjust prices to local idiosyncratic conditions; that is it is a scheme that partially
accommodates the realized demand heterogeneity. In this environment, the optimal
collusive strategy is to set paj,t = pak,t = v + 1, resulting in the market being split
equally. Retailers, having retained the flexibility to adjust prices downward, now are
free from competition and can extract all consumer surplus by setting pj,t = v + ξj,t
ξ
(in contrast, with no restraints there is competition so that pj,t = v + j,t
). Thus

An alternative punishment phase may involve using RPM and setting wt = pRP M = 0. This

Vertical restraints can facilitate collusion

A comparison of Propositions 7, 8 and 9 makes it clear that the collusive profits
with MAP dominate those without restrictions, which in turn dominate those from

employing RPM. That is, πM
AP > πN R > πRP M .
Further, employing a vertical restraint (whether MAP or RPM) for the cartel
can increase stability, in the sense that the force of future retribution for a deviation
coupled with the prospect of losing collusive gains becomes a stronger incentive relative to the gains from deviating. This increase in the strength of dynamic incentives
is captured by comparing the lower bound of the range of discount factors under
which collusion can be supported. √It can be easily verified that for v high enough (a
3v
sufficient condition is that v > 2+23 2 so that 6v−1
< 6v−2
) a cartel can be more easily

sustained with RPM. MAP, by contrast, increases stability relative to no restraints
for a wider range (or, indeed, RPM). This follows as it is easier to monitor a manufacturer deviation from the cartel arrangement, when this arrangement involves a
vertical restraint. When v is low then an RPM arrangement may be sacrificing too
much in terms of profits, just as in Jullien and Rey (2007), and the flexibility to

In any other rationing rule, the surplus extraction is inefficient, in that by retarding competition,
consumers are not directed toward those products that maximize gains from trade. In the case where

This is a more extreme form of punishment. With this punishment stage equilibrium, π p = 0. In
this case, Proposition 9 would instead require δ > 21 .

respond to local demand conditions is relatively valuable. MAP, on the other hand,
maintains flexibility and so does not demand the same trade-off.
Finally, as mentioned above, δ M AP < δ RP M suggesting that MAP policies may
help in stabilizing cartel agreements relative to RPM in addition to providing higher
cartel profits.62 This follows since, although in both arrangements it is equally easy
to monitor deviations from the cartel agreements, the MAP arrangement allows for
a higher cartel profit since it accommodates the heterogeneity associated with local
demand variation.
Thus MAP policies can allow a manufacturers’ cartel to attain greater surplus
extraction than a cartel that does not use MAP or RPM, and strengthen the dynamic
incentives that give the cartel stability, such that it is at least as stable as RPM.
As such, in this setting, MAP appears a more effective cartel facilitation device that
RPM.

Discussion

This paper has discussed both pro- and anti-competitive features of MAP policies.
MAP policies are distinct from RPM in that they can serve as a more effective way
to incentivize service, and as a more effective way to facilitate collusion. As such
it suggests that, to the extent that controversy surrounds the appropriate policy
treatment of vertical price restraints, the same, or greater, controversy should surround vertical information restraints, of which MAP is a prominent example. At the
very least, carefully considering the nature and impact of information constraints in
markets where search is a central feature seems warranted.
This paper leaves at least three areas of enquiry open. First, aside from the collusion model, the frameworks presented here do not consider the impact of competition
at the manufacturer level. Given that information restraints will likely change the
cross-price elasticities between competitors, even absent collusion, this seems a rich
area for further investigation.
Second, the models presented here limit the role of advertising to pure price advertising. This is analytically helpful in creating a clear mapping between the advertised
price and the transaction price, but suppresses aspects that may be important in a
richer model. An obvious issue in the price discrimination and collusion models is
that unit demand means that prices do not influence quantities to the extent they
might in a real market. A more delicate, and interesting, issue is that advertised

stage, then δ M AP = δ RP M .

prices may signal quality—an issue that is claimed to be a concern in some MAP
policy statements.
Lastly, the extent to which MAP, like other vertical restraints, can generate
exclusion of a rival is not explicitly investigated, although it is conjectured that, as
elsewhere, this effect can be generated.

Appendix A: Proofs
Lemma 1 Suppose that there are no advertising restrictions, then any perfect Bayesian
equilibrium is equivalent to one in which each retailer sets its advertised price equal
to its actual price i.e. paj = pj ∀j.
Proof. Suppose, toward a contradiction, that there is an equilibrium where this is
not the case. Then the equilibrium must involve (at least) two retailers, who charge
different prices, choosing the same advertised price a. Further, this must happen
with non-zero probability.
Consider all retailers who advertise at a. Of this set, let pmin (a) denote the price
of the retailer with the lowest actual price. Note that since there is more than one
retailer who advertises at a, it must be the case that consumers anticipate a non-zero
probability of an actual price strictly greater than pmin (a), and hence expect surplus
smaller than that generated by receiving pmin (a) with certainty.
The restriction that a retailer cannot charge a price higher than its advertised
price implies that, if the retailer charging pmin (a) advertised its actual price pmin (a),
consumers could not put any probability on the retailer charging a higher price
than pmin (a) (and might even put some probability on a lower price). That is they
anticipate an actual price that is equal to, or lower than pmin (a). Expected surplus
is similarly strictly increased.
Putting together the last observations in each of the two paragraphs above, it is
immediate that setting the advertised price at pmin (a) would attract strictly greater
demand as compared to choosing the advertised price a. This may be because demand is downward sloping, or through competition with another retailer. This generates the required contradiction.
Lastly, note that the argument above may support multiple equilibria. For instance, consider a market with two retailers. If equilibrium prices are uniquely set
at p1 and p2 ,such that p1 < p2 , then the argument above can be used to construct
equilibria in which pa1 ∈ [p1 , p2 ) and pa2 ≥ p2 . Given no economically meaningful
distinction exists between all these equilibria, they are considered equivalent to an
equilibrium in which paj = pj for all retailers j. In this example, the essential point
is that pa1 < p2 ≤ pa2 .
Lemma 2 In a MAP regime, in all monotone perfect Bayesian equilibria, each
retailer advertises its actual price unless theMAP restriction binds, and in this case
it advertises the MAP price; i.e. paj = max pM AP , pj .
Proof. The proof follows that of Lemma 1, but appeals to monotone beliefs rather
than Bayesian updating (that is, monotone beliefs take the place of the requirement
37

that advertised prices be at least as great as actual prices).

offers (w, T ) and sets pM AP = h. A monotone perfect Bayesian equilibrium in which
both retailers set pa = h, and RL sets p = l and RH sets p = H, exists if

If this equilibrium exists, it is unique if Conditions 1 and 2 are strict inequalities.
The optimal MAP policy sets w∗ , such that Condition 2 holds with equality, and T ∗
such that (h − w)(1 − λ) 12 − T ∗ = 0.
Proof. Condition 1 corresponds to RH preferring to charge h rather than l (in Figure
1, that A + B ≥ B + C). Condition 2 corresponds to RL preferring to charge l rather
than h (in Figure 1, that is, C + D ≥ A + B). Given that either p = h or p = l
dominate all other retail prices, these are conditions for best responses. Coupled
with Lemma 2, this establishes existence.


Next, note that if Condition 1 binds, then Condition 2 is slack, since λ + (1 − λ) 12 >
1
. Conversely, by the same reasoning, if Condition 2 binds then Condition 1 is slack.
2
Note it is impossible for both conditions to bind.
If Condition 1 binds and 2 is slack, then another equilibrium exists in which both
retailers set p = l. Having Condition 1 bind, implies that retailers are indifferent
between p = l and p = h when the other retailer is pricing l. Similarly, if Condition
2 binds and 1 is slack, then another equilibrium exists in which both retailers set
p = h.
Uniqueness applies, up the identity of the retailers. If both conditions hold as
strict inequalities, then the best response sets become singletons.
To see optimality, note that, if the surplus of the retailers are not equal, then
the lump-sum payment, T , will leave some surplus with one of the retailers. Hence,
full extraction requires that Condition 2 bind. As already noted, this means that
Condition 1 is satisfied.
Proposition 2 There exists a unique symmetric equilibrium pricing strategy such
that, for j ∈ {1, 2}:
1. if cj = cH , pH = w + cH

3. p is implicitly defined by q(p) p − w = α(p − w)q(p)

4. if cj = 0, price (pL ) is drawn from the distribution FL (p) =
with the support [p, p).

(p−w)q(p)−α(p−w)q(p)
(1−α)(p−w)q(p)

Proof. By standard Bertrand reasoning, if cj = cH then π(pH ) = 0. This implies
pH = cH + w.
For cj = 0, the equilibrium price distribution resembles that in Stahl (1989). The
maximal price is the minimum of the monopoly price given w and cj = 0, denoted
M
pM
L (w), and cH + w − ε such that ε −→ 0. That is, if pL (w) ≥ cH + w then the
maximal price of the price distribution will be arbitrarily close to cH + w. Hence, if
M
pM
L (w) ≥ cH + w, p = cH + w. Otherwise p = pL (w).
Since a mixed strategy requires that α(p−w)q(p) = [α + (1 − α) (1 − FL (p))] (p−
.
w)q(p) for all p in the support, it follows that FL (p) = (p−w)q(p)−α(p−w)q(p)
(1−α)(p−w)q(p)
The lower bound of the support is found by setting FL (p) = 0.
Proposition 3 Suppose that the minimum RPM price is P < w + cH (so that it
does not bind given a high cost realization) but binds given the low cost realization,
there exists a unique symmetric equilibrium pricing strategy such that for j ∈ {1, 2}:
1. if cj = cH , pH = w + cH
2. pmin = min{cH + w, pM
L (w)}
3. for p < pmin , Fmin P (p) is characterized by α(pmin −w)q(pmin ) = q(p)(p−w)(α+

Fmin P (p) with support P ∪ (pmin , pmin ) and an atom at P
6. if cj = 0, and pmin ≥ pmin then pL = P with probability 1.

Proof. The logic is similar to the proof of Proposition 2.
That there must be a mass point at P follows from the fact that it binds. Bertrand
reasoning determines the behavior of retailers with high cost realization.
Indifference (so that profits are the same at all prices that a low cost retailer
chooses in the pricing equilibrium) determines both properties 3 and 5.
Proposition 6 Assume that wj = wk = w. In a monotone perfect Bayesian

Proof. The proof follows the proof of equilibrium in a IPV symmetric first price

(16)

Let uk (ξk ) = ξk − pk (ξk ) and denote the equilibrium strategy to be βk (ξ) = u(ξj ),
and β −1 (uk ) = ξk . Assume that this strategy is monotone and increasing. To begin
assume that w ≤ v. Recall that ξ is uniformly distributed on [0, 1]. The retailers’
problem is then:
pj = arg max (p − w) β −1 (ξj − p)

It remains to deal with the case where w ≥ v. In this case, some measure of ξ
are excluded. The measure of included realizations is now U [w − v, 1]. This implies
that the boundary condition is now u(w − v) = 0, yielding the pricing part of the
proposition. That paj = pj follows from Lemma 1.
Proposition 7 A collusive equilibrium in which manufacturers set wt = v if
∈ [v, v + 12 ] for all j in all past periods, and wt = 0 otherwise, is supportable if

text πN R = v2 + 16 ; and in case the collusion breaks down, manufacturers earn the
one-shot profit which is denoted by π p = 16 .
Note that it is immediate that deviating to w > v cannot be optimal.
The proof proceeds by establishing properties of the optimal deviation of each
type, first by characterizing the retailers pricing when wj < wk = v and then examining the manufacturers problem in setting wj for each type of deviation. Finally, a
δ that is sufficient for none of the deviations to be attractive is derived.
First, consider the pricing of a retailer with a wholesale unit price of wj facing a
rival that prices in line with the cartel rule, such that pk = v + ξ2k .63 The retailer’s
pricing problem is

p∗j (ξj ) = arg max (p − wj ) Pr(ξj − p > ξk − v −
p

)
2

Recall that retailers are not part of any cartel agreement and compete in a static game.

41

(27)

Given that ξk is uniformly distributed on [0, 1], this amounts to maximizing
(p − w) (2ξj + 2v − 2p)

(28)

in the region where (2ξj + 2v − 2p) ∈ [0, 1] (outside of this region, either there is
no chance of winning, or the retailer wins for certain and is merely forgoing revenue
by dropping price). Ignoring this constraint results in the pricing rule p∗ (ξj ) :=
v+wj
ξ
+ 2j . If 2ξj + 2v − 2p∗ > 1, then the pricing rule is p = v − 12 + ξj .64 Further, if
2
2ξj +2v−2p∗ (ξj ) > 1, then the same inequality holds for all ξ n> ξj . This results in the

2
Next we turn to consider the manufacturer’s strategy. The first style of deviation
(D1), involves choosing the optimal deviation in the interval w ∈ [0, v − 1]. In this
interval, by inspection of the retailer’s pricing rule derived above, the probability of
detection is equal to 0.5 regardless of w. Hence, the optimal deviation can be derived
by maximizing the combined retailer-manufacturer-pair deviation payoff (since the
manufacturer can extract the retailer’s profit through the fixed fee). It is clear that
this is exactly what the retailer will do when wj = 0. Hence, the profit maximizing
D1 deviation arises when the retailer sets prices such that pj = v − 12 + ξj . From the
manufacturers point of view, this retailer pricing policy will arise for any w ∈ [0, v−1]
and so can be implemented in a variety of ways, all resulting in the same deviation
profit of v (the lump-sum component of the manufacturer’s two part tariff will be
used to extract remaining expected profits from the retailer). Thus the D1 deviation
yields π D1 = v and Pr(pj < v|wD1 ) = 12 .
Given this, we can solve for the minimum δ such that a D1 deviation is not
attractive. The D1 condition requires that

implying that when δ ≥ 6v−2

The second style of deviation (D2), leaves the probability ofndetection unchanged o

ξ ≤ 12 and undetected otherwise. Also, !recall that when
w = 0 the retailer chooses

pj = v − 2 + ξj . Hence, by setting w ∈ v − 1, v − 2 , the manufacturer diminishes
stage profits, with no compensating return in terms of adjusting the probability

Recall, v > 1, making this event relevant. In this event, the pricing rule is derived by raising p
until the chance of winning is equal to 1.

around detection (that is, leaving the continuation value unchanged). Hence, a D2
deviation must always be dominated by a D1 deviation.
The thirdstyle of deviation (D3), involves choosing the optimal deviation in the
interval w ∈ v − 12 , v . In this interval, a change in w will affect the probability of
ξ
detection; specifically, in this range, Pr(pj < v|w) = Pr( v+w

Section 4.2: The manufacturer’s problem with RPM
As described in the text, RPM can only play a role in inducing service provision in
one of two cases (i) either it binds for both low and high cost realizations; that is,
if P > w + cH ; or (ii) it leads a firm with a low cost realization to choose P with
certainty (which requires pmin > pmin as defined in Proposition 3). In the latter case,
it is immediate that a firm with a high cost realization makes no investment, and
the level of the investment of a firm with a high cost realization satisfies:
