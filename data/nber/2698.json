    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper analyzes the issue of persistent high unemployment. It focuses on two channels of persistence. The first is capital accumulation. The paper analyzes investment decisions under imperfect competition, focusing in particular on the effects of demand and cost shocks on investment, capital composition and bankruptcies, and their effect on employment and unemployment. The second is labor supply. The paper analyzes the various channels through which the unemployed may become disenfranchised, leading to higher equilibrium unemployment. In both cases, it briefly reviews and assesses the available empirical evidence. It ends by drawing several implications.\n\n",
