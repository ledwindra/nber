The Great Depression and the Friedman-Schwartz Hypothesis

ABSTRACT
We evaluate the Friedman-Schwartz hypothesis that a more accommodative monetary policy could
have greatly reduced the severity of the Great Depression. To do this, we first estimate a dynamic,
general equilibrium model using data from the 1920s and 1930s. Although the model includes eight
shocks, the story it tells about the Great Depression turns out to be a simple and familiar one. The
contraction phase was primarily a consequence of a shock that induced a shift away from privately
intermediated liabilities, such as demand deposits and liabilities that resemble equity, and towards
currency. The slowness of the recovery from the Depression was due to a shock that increased the
market power of workers.
We identify a monetary base rule which responds only to the money demand shocks in the model.
We solve the model with this counterfactual monetary policy rule. We then simulate the dynamic
response of this model to all the estimated shocks. Based on the model analysis, we conclude that
if the counterfactual policy rule had been in place in the 1930s, the Great Depression would have
been relatively mild.

Introduction

The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the construction of dynamic general equilibrium
models useful for the analysis of policy questions. We do this by developing a standard
monetary business cycle model in three directions: We add several shocks, a banking sector
and financial frictions. We subject this model to what is perhaps the toughest possible test.
We fit the model to U.S. data from the 1920s and 1930s and ask whether a diﬀerent monetary
policy might have moderated the output collapse experienced in the Great Depression.1 Our
analysis suggests that the answer is “yes.” This is consistent with the hypothesis of Friedman
and Schwartz (1963).
Apart from its intrinsic historical interest, there are two reasons we examine the U.S.
economy in the 1930s. First, there is a general consensus that the Great Depression was a
consequence of the interaction of several shocks with financial markets, labor markets, and
the banking system. As a result, this episode constitutes a natural laboratory for studying
a model like ours. Second, there is widespread interest in understanding whether monetary
policy authorities in a low-interest-rate environment have the power to resist deflation and
output collapse. This is the situation confronted by the US monetary authorities in the
1930s.
The counterfactual monetary policy that we study temporarily expands the growth rate
in the monetary base in the wake of a money demand shock. To ensure that this policy
does not violate the zero lower-bound constraint on the interest rate, we consider policies
which increase the monetary base in the periods after a shock.2 By injecting an anticipated
inflation eﬀect into the interest rate, this delayed-response feature of our policy prevents
the zero bound constraint from binding along the equilibrium paths that we consider. Of
course, for the anticipated inflation eﬀect to be operative, the public must believe that the
central bank will in fact raise the future growth rate of the monetary base. In our analysis,
we assume the central bank has this credibility.3
1

There are numerous other quantitative analyses of the Great Depression, with perhaps the first being
Lucas and Rapping (1972). In addition, there is the work of Bordo, Choudhri, and Schwartz (1995), Bordo,
Erceg, and Evans (2000), Christiano (1999), Cole and Ohanian (1999, 2001, 2003, 2003a), McCallum (1990),
and Sims (1999).
2
An alternative strategy for stimulating the economy when the nominal rate of interest is near zero is
to drive the rate to its lower bound and hold it there for a while (see Eggertsson and Woodford (2003)
for a discussion). Because the policy involves an occasionally binding constraint, studying it requires confronting substantial computational challenges, which we have not pursued here. Computational strategies
for imposing constraints that bind occasionally are discussed in Christiano and Fisher (2000).
3
Recently, several analysts have voiced skepticism that the sort of monetary policy we study has credibility.
They argue that central bankers - either as a result of a careful assessment of their incentives and constraints,
or because of an unreasoned preference - may have an unshakable commitment to low inflation at all times.
(See, for example, Krugman 1998, Eggertsson 2003, Eggertsson and Woodford 2003, Sims 1999, and others.)
There are two ways to interpret the fact that we abstract from these concerns in our study. First, a convincing
demonstration that temporarily high inflation in the wake of certain types of shocks would have had desirable

2

In our model we focus on monetary policy alone, in isolation from fiscal policy. Implicitly, we assume that the fiscal authorities accommodate any fiscal implications of monetary
policy by a suitable adjustment in taxes.4 We abstract from the distortionary eﬀects of the
latter, by assuming the adjustments are done with lump sum taxes. The notion that the
fiscal authorities passively (in the sense of Leeper 1991) adjust the variables in their budget constraint to accommodate changes in circumstances is consistent with accounts of the
1930s.5
Although our estimated model has eight shocks, two of them turn out to be particularly
significant. The first is a “liquidity preference shock”, which plays an important role in
the contraction phase of the Great Depression.6 This shock drives households to accumulate
currency at the expense of demand deposits and other liabilities (time deposits) that are used
to fund entrepreneurs who own and operate the economy’s stock of capital.7 The impact on
the real economy of these responses to the liquidity preference shock is determined by the
nature of intermediation in our model.
Demand deposits are issued by banks, which use the proceeds to fund working-capital
loans to goods-producing firms. We capture this by adopting a version of the fractional
reserve banking model of Chari, Christiano, and Eichenbaum (1995). Our model allows
us to study the mechanism whereby households’ shift away from demand deposits leads
to a slowdown in economic activity. Time deposits are issued by banks for the purpose of
financing entrepreneurs, who own and operate the economy’s stock of capital. Entrepreneurs
consequences during the Great Depression may help promote the institutional or other changes necessary
for such a policy to be credible in the future. Second, a case can be made that the policy would in fact
have been credible in the U.S. in the 1930s. Reinforced by the gold standard, the price level had been stable
throughout the previous decade. So, it might have seemed natural for the public to expect at least some
inflation after the initial price level drop in the early 1930s. Moreover, as the Great Depression proceeded, a
political constituency in favor of inflation began to take hold (Kennedy 1999.) Much of this constituency was
in the Democratic Party, which was the party of the president after Roosevelt was elected in the fall of 1932.
On this basis, we conjecture that a policy of temporary inflation, even one that somewhat exceeded what
was implied by a price level target, would not have been incredible in the U.S. in the 1930s. (However, as
argued recently by Orphanides 2003, such a policy would have required some changes at the Federal Reserve,
whose oﬃcials had a low tolerance for inflation.)
4
That the operating characteristics of monetary policy depend sensitively on the assumptions one makes
about fiscal policy has been emphasized recently in the literature on the fiscal theory of the price level. See,
for example, Leeper and Sims (1994), Sims (1994), and Woodford (1994, 1996). (Christiano and Fitzgerald
2000 provide a critical review).
5
Concerns about fiscal solvency motivated Herbert Hoover to ask for the sizeable tax increase that became
the Revenue Act of 1932 (Kennedy 1999, p. 79). Roosevelt was also concerned about fiscal solvency. He
pushed for one bill to reduce government spending and another to raise taxes because “For three long years
the Federal Government has been on the road toward bankruptcy.” (Kennedy 1999, p. 138). These bills
were the Economy Act of March 20, 1933 and the Beer-Wine act of March 22, 1933.
6
For a related discussion, see Field (1984), who argues that a money demand shock played an important
role during this time.
7
This is consistent with Sims (1999), who finds that disturbances that resulted in a flow out of bank
deposits and into currency were important during the Great Depression.

require bank financing because their own net worth is insuﬃcient to finance the purchase
of the economy’s capital stock. We capture the financial arrangements associated with
entrepreneurs with a version of the agency cost model of financial frictions of Bernanke,
Gertler, and Gilchrist (1999) (BGG).8
We now briefly summarize the ways in which households’ shift away from time deposits
leads to a decline in economic activity. The ‘first round’ eﬀect of the shift is obvious: by
reducing the funding available to entrepreneurs, the shift leads to a fall in capital purchases
and, hence, investment. The financial frictions induce additional eﬀects which magnify this
initial decline in investment. These ‘accelerator eﬀects’ occur as the initial decline in investment leads to a fall in entrepreneurial net worth. This fall occurs through three channels.
First, the initial decline in entrepreneurial demand for capital produces a fall in its price.
This reduces the net worth of entrepreneurs by reducing the market value of their physical
assets.9 Second, net worth is reduced by the “debt deflation” eﬀect emphasized by Irving
Fisher (1933). In the model, we specify that the return received by households on time deposits is nominally non-state contingent. Moreover, the liquidity preference shock generates
a surprise fall in the price level as spending declines. This surprise fall in the price level
increases the real payoﬀ to creditors (households) at the expense of debtors (entrepreneurs).
Although there is generally a presumption in macroeconomics that reallocations of wealth of
this type are neutral in the aggregate, in our model they are not. This is because the reallocation takes funds away from agents who have access to investment opportunities (i.e., the
entrepreneurs) and gives them to people who do not (i.e., the households).10 A third factor
down driving net worth is the general slowdown in economic activity which, by reducing the
rental rate of capital, leads to a reduction in entrepreneurial income.11
Households’ attempts to obtain more currency also induces them to cut back on consumption expenditures, which further depresses aggregate spending. These eﬀects of the liquidity
preference shock produce, with one exception, responses that resemble the behavior of the
8

This work builds on Gale and Hellwig (1985) and Townsend (1979). Related models include those of
Carlstrom and Fuerst (1997,2000).
9
Cole and Ohanian (2001) cite evidence that business loans remained relatively strong during the contraction phase of the depression. They suggest that this evidence represents an embarassment for models
of financial frictions. It is useful to note that it is not necessarily a problem for the model considered here.
In the model, the fall in asset prices triggered by a liquidity preference shock is expected to be undone over
time. By creating anticipated capital gains, this raises the prospective return on capital. The nature of the
loan contract is such that when this happens, the amount of loans an entrepreneur receives for a given level
of net worth goes up. During the first few years of the Great Depression people, in fact, did think that the
end of the output decline was near, and things would return to normal soon (see Kennedy 1999.)
10
This is where our model diﬀers from that in BGG. Because their model is non-monetary, they cannot
capture the debt-deflation mechanism. Our way of incorporating this mechanism is consistent with the
remarks in the conclusion of BGG.
11
In our model there are additional sources of non-neutrality associated with the entrepreneurs. These
stem from the fact that the liquidity preference shock generates a rise in bankruptcies, which generate real
resource costs.

U.S. economy from late 1929 to 1933. The exception is that the mechanism implies a rise in
the interest rate, whereas interest rates actually fell sharply during this period. It turns out,
however, that the rise in the interest rate in response to a liquidity preference shock is small
and transient, and is soon followed by a persistent fall. Although we have not confirmed
this, we suspect this fall in the interest rate is a consequence of the accelerator mechanism
implied by the financial frictions. Consistent with the analysis in Friedman and Schwartz
(1963), our counterfactual experiment suggests that failure of the Federal Reserve to respond
appropriately to this and other money demand shocks in the 1930s was the reason that the
slump that began in 1929 ultimately became the Great Depression.12
As in the case of the other shocks in our model, our analysis is silent about the fundamental origins of the liquidity preference shock. We suspect that a more careful analysis of this
shock would lead to the conclusion that it is not invariant to the nature of monetary policy,
as we assume here. In fact, a more accommodative monetary policy might have reduced the
volatility of the liquidity preference shock, as well as of other monetary shocks in the model.
So, we think of our analysis as placing a lower bound on what monetary policy might have
achieved in the 1930s. In addition, an implication of our analysis is that a deeper study of
the microeconomic sources of liquidity preference and other monetary shocks would lead to
a better understanding of the Great Depression, and possibly other business cycle episodes
as well.
The second shock that plays an significant role in our analysis is particularly important
in the expansion phase of the Great Depression. A puzzle during this phase is that hours
worked recovered only slightly in the period, 1933-1939. The estimated model’s answer to
this puzzle is that there was a rise in the market power of workers. This feature of the model
accords well with the widespread notion that the policies of the New Deal had the eﬀect
of pushing up wages and reducing employment by giving workers greater bargaining power
(Cole and Ohanian 2003.)
In fact, the above story oversimplifies somewhat the account of the Depression implicit
in our estimated model. There are many details that the liquidity preference and market
power shocks miss. Six other shocks in the model fill in those details. All these shocks
are pinned down by the fact that we consider a large range of data in the analysis. The
thirteen variables that we consider are the Dow Jones Industrial average, aggregate output,
aggregate employment, the aggregate real wage, a short-term interest rate, the premium on
Baa bonds, the monetary base, M1, inflation, investment, consumption, demand deposits,
12

To the extent that the Fed chose not to accommodate money demand shocks because it felt constrained
by the gold standard, our analysis of the contraction phase of the Great Depression is consistent with the
analysis of Eichengreen and others, who lay the blame for the Great Depression with the gold standard.
There is some debate over how binding a restriction the gold standard was for monetary policy (Bordo,
Choudhri, and Schwartz 1995).

and bank reserves. We display our model’s implications for all these variables. The large
number of variables imposes substantial discipline on the analysis.
The outline of the paper is as follows. In the next section, we present an informal
discussion of the data on the Great Depression, as a way to motivate key features of our
model. Section 3 presents the formal model economy. Section 4 discusses the assignment of
parameter values and model fit. Section 5 discusses the explanation of the Great Depression
that is implicit in our estimated model. Section 6 discusses the counterfactual analysis.
Section 7 concludes. Various technical details are relegated to appendices.

Key Macroeconomic Variables in the Interwar Period

We now briefly review the relevant data and literature that motivate the general design of our
model. It is worth emphasizing both what is in the model, as well as what is not. In terms of
the latter, the model we construct abstracts from international considerations. This choice
is motivated by the arguments of Bordo, Choudhri, and Schwartz (1995), Romer (1993), and
others, which claim that the U.S. Great Depression can be understood in domestic terms
only. Also, we are sympathetic to the arguments in Romer (1993) and Temin (1976), which
maintain that exogenous monetary policy disturbances were probably not an important
impulse driving the Great Depression.13 Our model abstracts completely from such shocks.
We explain what it is about the data that leads us to leave them out. In addition, our model
de-emphasizes somewhat the classical sticky wage mechanism by which spending shocks have
traditionally been assumed to aﬀect real output and employment.14 We explain what it is
about the data that leads us to assign a relatively greater role to alternative mechanisms.
As we review the data, we describe the impulse and propagation mechanisms that we think
do warrant further consideration and which are included in our model.

Aggregate Quantities

Our data are displayed in Figure 1. For convenience, the fourth-quarter observations for
1929 and later are indicated by an asterisk (*). Consider the real per capita Gross National
Product (GNP) data, which are normalized to unity in 1929.15 Note that these fall by one13

Sims (1999) uses methods based on vector autoregressions to conclude that monetary policy shocks were
not an important source of variation in economic activity.
14
See Bordo, Erceg, and Evans (2001) for a formal representation of the notion that the Great Depression
reflected the eﬀects of contractionary shocks to monetary policy operating on the economy through a sticky
wage mechanism.

Nominal GNP data were taken from Balke and Gordon (1986). GNP was converted to 1929 dollars
using the GNP deflator taken from the National Bureau of Economic Research’s Macro History database at
http://www.nber.org/databases/macrohistory/contents/. Real GNP was converted to per capita terms by a

6

third from 1929 to 1933. The recovery is very slow, and by 1939 output is only barely back
to its 1929 level. To understand the composition of these fluctuations, consider the data
on consumption and investment in Figure 1. Consumption includes household consumption
of nondurables and services, while investment includes business investment plus household
purchases of durable goods. The consumption and investment data have been divided by the
level of output in 1929 to give an indication of their magnitude in relation to output. Note
that the drop in consumption is relatively small, falling from about 65 percent of the 1929
level of GNP in 1929 to about 50 percent of the 1929 level of GNP in 1933. The behavior of
investment is more dramatic. It drops 80 percent, falling from 25 percent of the 1929 level
of GNP in 1929 to 5 percent of that level in 1933. These are the observations that have
motivated researchers to speculate that the key to understanding the start of the Great Depression lies in understanding the dynamics of investment (see Romer 1993 and Temin 1976.)
Another way to see just how much investment fell is to compare the fall in the investmentto-output ratio from 1929 to 1933 with the fall in that ratio in other recessions. Table 1
displays the investment-to-output ratio at NBER peaks and troughs for the 1929 recession
and for 9 other postwar recessions. In recessions since the Great Depression, reductions in
the investment-to-output ratio have been no greater than 3 percentage points. Results in
Cole and Ohanian (2001, Table 1) indicate that the fall in the investment-to-output ratio in
the 1920-1921 recession was also relatively small. By contrast, the drop in the investmentto-output ratio in the Great Depression, which was 19 percentage points, was an order of
measure of population from Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2002), who derive it from Kendrick (1961) (the
data were taken from Ellen McGrattan’s website). Their measure of population is linearly interpolated to
construct quarterly figures. Nominal investment includes household purchases of durable goods, investment
in equipment, investment in residential and nonresidential structures, and change in inventories. It was
taken from Balke and Gordon (1986). It was converted to per capita 1929 dollars using the GNP deflator
and the measure of population. Nominal consumption is household consumption of nondurable goods and
services and is taken from Balke and Gordon (1986). It is converted to per capita 1929 dollars using the
GNP deflator and the measure of population. Hours worked is the number of hours of all employees, plus
the self employed, plus those involved in unpaid family work. It includes government hours, except for hours
worked in the military. It is expressed as a ratio to the annual endowment of hours and taken from Chari,
Kehoe, and McGrattan (2002), who build on data from Kendrick (1961). The Dow Jones is taken from the
NBER dataset. It is converted to real per capita terms using the GNP deflator and population. Monetary
variables are taken from Friedman and Schwartz (1963) and are converted to per capita terms using our
population measure. The short-term interest rate is the three-month rate on Treasury securities and it is
taken from the NBER database. The interest rate spread is the diﬀerence between yields on Baa and Aaa
corporate bonds, which are obtained from the NBER database. The real wage is hourly compensation. It is
constructed as follows. Total compensation from NIPA, available at an annual frequency starting from 1929,
is divided by our measure of hours worked and interpolated to obtain quarterly figures using the related
series of average hourly earnings in manufacturing from Hanes (1996). For the period 1923-1928 we used
average hourly earnings in manufacturing from Hanes (1996). The two series were spliced together. Finally,
the series is converted to real terms using the GNP deflator. We did not use earnings in manufacturing from
Hanes (1996) for the whole sample because wages in manufacturing experienced a much stronger rise than
wages in the other sectors during the 1930s (see Cole and Ohanian 1999.) On the other hand, the measure of
hourly compensation we constructed is not totally satisfactory, as self-employed and unpaid family workers
are included in hours worked but are excluded from the NIPA measure of total compensation.

magnitude greater than that which occurred in these other recessions.
Figure 1 also displays economy-wide per capita hours worked, normalized to unity in 1929.
Employment dropped by roughly 25 percent from 1929 to 1933. Notably, hours worked in
the 1930s never recovered much from their low level in 1933. By 1939 they settled to a level
about 20 percent below their level in 1929. This observation has led many to conjecture
that one set of factors at work in the recovery phase of the Great Depression may have been
institutional and other changes that led to a permanent reduction in “normal” hours worked
per person. Our model is designed to accommodate such factors using a device that is in
the spirit of the analysis of Cole and Ohanian (2003). In particular, we do so by adopting a
model specification which allows households’ labor market power to fluctuate over time.

2.2

Exogenous Monetary Policy Shocks in the Great Depression

There is a general consensus that the initial phase of the contraction began with the slowdown
in economic growth in the summer of 1929, just before the stock market crash. Many
researchers follow Keynes’s (1930, p. 196) assessment that that slowdown reflected the
eﬀects of high interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve. Some argue that monetary
policy shocks also played an important role in other phases of the Great Depression. In our
analysis of the Great Depression we abstract from monetary policy shocks altogether. This
subsection reviews our reasons for doing this.
Figure 1, panel F shows that real M1 was roughly constant during the initial phase of
the contraction, 1929-1932 (and also more generally, from about 1926 to the end of 1932).
In view of the substantial drop in output that occurred, this implies that M1 velocity fell.
Models that have performed well with postwar U.S. data generally imply that an exogenous,
contractionary monetary policy shock leads to a fall in real balances and a rise in velocity.16
This is not to say that monetary policy was not tight at all during this period. For example,
the real value of the monetary base (not shown in Figure 1) did fall, although only by a
small amount.17 Still, it seems unlikely that an exogenous contractionary shock to monetary
policy was an important impulse for the Great Depression. To the extent that there was some
tightness in monetary policy, it was relatively small, certainly by the historical standards of
the time (see Romer 1990 for additional discussion).
The spike in the interest rate in late 1931 is sometimes explained as reflecting a contractionary response by the Federal Reserve to the British decision to abandon the gold
standard. Since British monetary policy was not in any obvious way related to economic
developments in the U.S., it is natural in an analysis of the U.S. Depression experience to
16

See, for example, Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2003).
In 1929IV the real monetary base was 5 percent lower than it was in 1928I. Also, Bernanke (2002) reports
that the Fed’s portfolio of government securities fell in the period before the crash.
17

treat Britain’s action as an exogenous shock to U.S. financial markets. But should it be
treated as a shock to money supply or money demand? The continued robust growth in the
real, per capita monetary base is not consistent with the money supply interpretation. In
1931IV, the real monetary base stood 5 percent higher than it had in 1931III. Then, over
the next two quarters the real, per capita monetary base grew at quarterly rates of 1 percent
and 6 percent, respectively. This and other data suggest that the 1931 interest rate spike is
better thought of as reflecting a shock to money demand. For example, during this period,
the currency-to-deposit ratio began to rise, and bank reserves in 1931IV were 2 percent below their level in 1931III. These observations are consistent with the notion that there was
a shift in preferences away from demand deposits. Clearly, this is one way to think of the
bank runs occurring at this time. In addition, it is a way to think of the run on the dollar
which was believed to have been triggered by the British decision on gold.
There are two other episodes that are often interpreted as reflecting the operation of
monetary policy shocks. The first is the sharp increase in money growth in April to July
of 1932, and the second is a sharp decrease in the period January to March 1933. These
monetary actions are thought to be responsible for the “double dip” nature of the Great
Depression. Although it is not evident in the data presented in Figure 1, data on manufacturing output show a dip in output in 1932, followed by a rise, and then another dip
in 1933.18 This pattern closely follows the variations in money growth. In our analysis we
interpret these as reflecting the interaction of nonmonetary policy shocks with the monetary
authority’s monetary policy rule.
Finally, there is the switch to a faster money growth rate following the U.S. departure
from the gold standard in April of 1933 (see Figure 1, panel F). In our analysis we model
monetary policy as a single regime, and so we abstract from the apparent change in regime
that occurred in 1933. Incorporating a regime switch into the analysis would be a useful
step, which we leave to future research. Addressing this properly requires taking a potentially
controversial stand on the exact nature of the change in monetary policy, as well as on the
nature of the public’s perception of that change.

2.3

The Sticky Wage Mechanism

In our terminology, the sticky wage mechanism reflects two features. First, firms are assumed
to always be on their labor demand schedule, which itself is not perturbed by shocks to
aggregate spending. Second, nominal wages are sticky.19 As a result, the only way for a
negative aggregate spending shock to reduce employment and output is for the shock to
18

See, for example, Figure IV in Mills (1934).
The two assumptions just described correspond to equations (1) and (2) of the model used by Bernanke
and Carey (1996). They state that in using this model to analyze the Great Depression, they are following
the lead of Eichengreen and Sachs (1985).

drive the price level down and the real wage up.20 The problem is that there is no evidence,
either in the U.S. time-series or in a cross-section of countries, that the contraction phase
of the Great Depression is associated with a sharp rise in the real wage (for a discussion of
the cross-section, see Cole and Ohanian 2003a.) These considerations lead us to emphasize
model features which have been employed in analyses of postwar data, which allow spending
shocks to shift the labor demand schedule. In models with these features, it is not necessary
for the real wage to rise when a spending contraction reduces output.21
Panel L in Figure 1, displays the economy-wide real wage. Note that there is no evidence
that it surges above trend as output and employment begin their plunge after 1929. Indeed,
this measure of the real wage was actually low in 1932 and 1933, when the economy hit
bottom. Aggregate data for the manufacturing sector do provide some evidence of a rise
in the real wage after 1929. For example, according to Cole and Ohanian (1999, Table
11) the manufacturing wage compiled by Hanes (1996), converted to real terms using the
GNP deflator, is about 5 percent above trend during the period 1930-1932.22 However, the
work of Bresnahan and Raﬀ (1991), Lebergott (1989), and Margo (1993) suggests that this
rise may, for compositional reasons, overstate what happened to the typical manufacturing
worker’s real wage. In particular, Bresnahan and Raﬀ (1991) and Lebergott (1989) report
evidence that low-wage jobs were terminated first, injecting an upward bias in standard
industry-wide average estimates. Margo (1993, p. 44) concludes that eliminating the bias
due to compositional factors like this ‘...would produce an aggregate decline in nominal wages
between 1929 and 1932 as much as 48 percent larger than that measured by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics.’ If the bias were only a little more than one-tenth of Margo’s estimate,
then the rise in the measured manufacturing real wage turns into an outright fall for the
typical worker.23
20

Although the sticky wage mechanism is often attributed to Keynes, he himself changed his mind about
the relationship between real wages and output after the famous critique by Dunlop and Tarshis. At that
time, Keynes blamed Alfred Marshall for the idea that real wages and output necessarily move in opposite
directions. He referred to Marshall’s view as a “dogma” which was, in fact, not consistent with the data.
Upon examining data from 1880 and after, Keynes concluded that the negative relationship between real
wages and output held only in the first six years of this period, “the formative period in Marshall’s thought
in this matter....but has never once held good in the fifty years since [Marshall] crystallized it!” (Keynes
1939, p.38).
21
Using postwar U.S. data, Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2003) present evidence based on minimal
model assumptions (using vector autoregression techniques) to argue that a contractionary shock to monetary
policy produces a small drop in the real wage. They estimate a dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium
model that is consistent with this finding.
22
Cole and Ohanian assume a trend growth rate of 1.9 percent per year for the manufacturing real wage.
23
One way to make Margo’s estimate concrete is as follows. According to Cole and Ohanian (1999, Table
11), the detrended real wage in 1932 stood at 105, with its 1929 value equal to 100. Margo’s calculation
suggests that if composition biases are eliminated from the data, then if the typical wage earner’s wage in
1929 were 100, that worker earned only 0.52×105=54.6 in 1932.
Unlike the Bureau of Labor Statistics data that Margo is referring to, Hanes’ (1996) data attempt to
correct for some sources of composition bias. The exact magnitude of the composition bias is controversial,

10

As emphasized by Bordo, Erceg, and Evans (2001), there is another issue that must be
addressed before one can draw definite conclusions from the behavior of manufacturing real
wages. Most of the analyses cited in the previous paragraph convert the nominal manufacturing wage to a real wage using an aggregate measure of prices. However, the conventional
theory pertains not to this, but to the real wage measured in terms of the price of the firm’s
product. So, it is important to consider the behavior of the manufacturing wage in relation
to some measure of the manufacturing price level. According to Mills (1934, Table 5), the
price index of manufactured goods was 91, 78, 70, and 72 in the years 1930-1933, with the
price normalized at 100 in 1929. The measure of the GNP deflator used by Cole and Ohanian
(1999, Table 8) is 97, 88, 78, and 77 for the same years, and with the same normalization.
Evidently, with the Mills estimate of manufacturing prices, the manufacturing real wage is
higher by only 5-10 percent. This increase is still substantially smaller than Margo’s estimate
of the magnitude of the composition bias.24
The disaggregated manufacturing data also raise questions about the sticky wage mechanism. Under the mechanism, a drop in output is fundamentally driven by a fall in the price
level, so that those sectors where price falls the most should have experienced the biggest
output decline. Mills (1934, Figure V) presents evidence that conflicts with this prediction.
He shows that in 1932-1933, production in durable and nondurable manufacturing was about
76 and 31 percent, respectively, below their 1929 levels. The magnitude of the associated
price declines was the reverse of what the sticky wage mechanism predicts. Mills reports that
the price of durables fell only about 22 percent, while the price of nondurables fell about 65
percent.
The U.S. time-series data on the recovery phase of the Great Depression also pose a
problem for the sticky wage mechanism. Note from Figure 1, panel L, that there is no
evidence of a surge down in the real wage, as employment begins to recover in 1934-1936.
In sum, it does not look as though the shock or shocks that are responsible for the U.S.
Great Depression operated through the sticky wage mechanism. There just does not seem
to be a tight negative relationship between the real wage one the one hand, and output and
employment on the other. Accordingly, we adopt a model environment with the property
that variables other than just employment and the real wage enter the labor demand curve.
These variables include capacity utilization and variable markups, as well as the interest
rate. The latter enters because our model takes into account the fact that firms must borrow
working-capital to finance their variable costs. In our model, markups vary because of
with at least one author (Dighe 1997) claiming it is negligible.
24
Sometimes, the wholesale price index is used to deflate the manufacturing real wage (see Bernanke and
Carey 1996, and Bordo, Erceg, and Evans 2001.) However, as emphasized by Mills (1934, table 2), the prices
of manufactured goods rose substantially relative to wholesale prices. So, deflating nominal manufacturing
wages using the wholesale price index overstates the real cost of labor to manufacturing firms.

11

fluctuations in the monopoly power of firms, as well as because of frictions in price setting.
Incorporating variable capital utilization into an analysis of the Great Depression is quite
natural. Bresnahan and Raﬀ (1991) show that about 30 percent of the reduction in jobs in
the automobile industry was associated with plant closing, i.e., idle plant and equipment. In
his classic analysis of total factor productivity, Solow (1957) assumes that the rate of capital
utilization is the same as the rate of utilization of the labor force, and so he measures capital
utilization by 1 minus the unemployment rate. This number, of course, falls dramatically
during the Great Depression. Variations in the markup are also natural to consider in view
of the many legislative and other changes in the 1930s, aﬀecting the degree of competition
among firms.25
It has long been recognized that there is a simple alternative way to reconcile the sticky
wage mechanism with an absence of correlation between the real wage and output. That is to
assume that there are exogenous shocks to labor supply, i.e., technology shocks.26 As Bordo,
Erceg, and Evans (2001) note, the fact that the real wage did not surge above trend in 19301931 could be reconciled with the sticky wage mechanism, if we assume there was a negative
shock to technology at the time. Nevertheless, we are skeptical that technology shocks
played an important role during the Great Depression. Analysts have generally concluded
that technological change continued in the 1930s at the same or higher rate than in the 1920s.
For example, Field (2001) concludes, “In spite of tremendous losses due to underutilized labor
and capital, the 1930s were, paradoxically, also an extraordinarily fertile period from the
standpoint of technical change, one in which a disproportionately large number of key product
and process innovations took place.” (See also, Field 2003.) Other researchers reached similar
conclusions.27 For example, Solow (1957, p. 316) concludes from his total factor productivity
measurements, that “...there is some evidence that technical change (broadly interpreted)
may have accelerated after 1929.” Other researchers who similarly concluded that the pace of
technical change continued without interruption after 1929 include Mills (1934; see especially
his Table 4) and Bliss (1934; see especially his Table III). Despite this skepticism, we do
include technology shocks into our model. We will let the data determine whether they are
important.
25

For an excellent review, see Kennedy (1999).
This approach has been advocated in Cole and Ohanian (1999, 2003a).
27
An example is Bliss (1934, p. 6): “A period of depression is conducive to improvement in labor productivity. Faced with narrowing profit margins, businessmen strive for cheaper, more direct, more eﬃcient
methods of production. With overhead costs per unit increasing special eﬀort is made to reduce direct
costs per unit, largely by laying oﬀ the less eﬃcient workers and by improving management.” Commenting
on his estimates that the productivity of employed labor exhibited strong growth in the period 1929-1932,
Bliss (1934, p. 7) remarks, “Taken together, these estimates indicate an increase in output per man-hour of
approximately 25 percent in four years, an amazing advance indeed.” Mills attributed some, but not all, of
the advance in productivity to temporary factors.
26

2.4

Other Variables and Mechanisms

There are several variables that exhibit dramatic fluctuations during the Great Depression.
One suspects that they point to important sources of shocks or sources of propagation for
other shocks. For example, Panel H in Figure 1 displays the Dow Jones Industrial Average
(DOW), deflated by the GNP deflator. Note how dramatically the stock market fell from
1929 to 1933. The magnitude of the drop is similar to that of investment. It is therefore
not surprising that several researchers have argued that financial asset markets must be
part of any explanation of the Great Depression.28 We integrate financial markets into our
environment using the modeling strategy of Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (1999).
Friedman and Schwartz (1963) draw attention to the very large movements in the currencyto-deposit ratio and the reserves-to-deposit ratio (see Panels I and J, respectively). We follow
Friedman and Schwartz (1963) and others in pursuing the idea that these movements have
much to do with the dynamics of the Great Depression. As discussed above, to some extent
they reflect the consequences of the bank runs in the 1930s. We do not pursue a “deep” theory of bank runs in this paper. Instead, we model the movements in the currency-to-deposit
ratio and in the reserves-to-deposit ratio as reflecting various exogenous shocks to money
demand.
Discussions of risk play a role in analyses of the Great Depression (see, for example,
Romer 1990.) According to evidence in Harrison and Weder (2003), concerns about risk
were probably not an important factor at the very beginning of the depression, in late 1929
or early 1930. For example, the premium on Baa over Aaa corporate bonds does not exhibit
a sharp rise until the first wave of bank runs, in late 1930 (see Figure 1, panel K). However,
the premium is so much larger in the mid-1930s than it was throughout the 1920s, that it
may have played a role in prolonging the Great Depression, perhaps by keeping investment
low.29 Our way of introducing financial asset markets into the analysis allows for increased
risk to aﬀect investment.
In the previous subsection we discussed how the behavior of the real wage leads us to
incorporate mechanisms that shift labor demand. A similar issue arises in the case of labor
supply. The data suggest finding mechanisms that shift labor supply or, put households
“oﬀ their labor supply schedule.” The question that must be confronted from the point
of view of labor supply is why did household labor eﬀort fall so sharply, even though the
real wage continued on its trend set in the 1920s? Of course, this is a classic puzzle that
28

See, for example, Bernanke (2002), Cecchetti (1998), Fisher (1933), Mishkin (1978), Romer (1993), and
Temin (1976).
29
A related possibility is raised by the analysis in Bernanke (1983). This suggests that the rise in the risk
premium and the fall in investment may both have been a consequence of the damage done to the banking
system by the banking panics. See Gertler (2001) for a more extensive discussion of the premium in Baa
over Aaa bonds. He expresses skepticism that the premium reflects risk alone.

13

confronts equilibrium analyses of business cycles generally. Hall (1997) gave the puzzle a
quantitative expression by showing that an equilibrium approach to business fluctuations
leads to the implication that households are hit by a shock that resembles an increased
preference for leisure in a recession (see also Ingram, Kocherlakota, and Savin 1997 and
Parkin 1988.) Applying the approach of Hall, who works with postwar data, Chari, Kehoe,
and McGrattan (2002) and Mulligan (2002) find that the early phase of the Great Depression
is also characterized by an upward shift in the preference for leisure. This shift has various
interpretations. For example, it can be interpreted as reflecting an increase in the labor
market power of households, which leads them to restrict the supply of their labor services.
Following Gali, Gertler and Lopez-Salido (2002), it can also reflect that households are, in
eﬀect, “oﬀ their labor supply schedules,” because of the presence of sticky wages. These
considerations lead us to incorporate household labor market power and frictions in wage
setting into our model.
An unusual feature of the Great Depression is that, in the estimation of Chari, Kehoe,
and McGrattan (2002) and Mulligan (2002), the shock that resembles a preference for leisure
does not fall again in the recovery phase, as Hall shows it does in postwar recessions. This
is a manifestation of the fact that employment rose so little (see Panel D, Figure 1) in the
recovery phase, even though real wage continued strong. The standard explanation is that
this reflects the eﬀects of New Deal programs designed to prop up the real wage.30 This is
another reason that our model specification allows for fluctuations in household labor market
power.
The preceding considerations suggest to us that a model that captures the key forces in
play during the Great Depression must have several features:
• It must capture the determinants of investment behavior. To be interesting, these
determinants should include a possible role for changes in the value of financial assets
and in perceptions of risk.
• The real side of the economy should incorporate disturbances to the labor demand
schedule, including time-varying markups, capacity utilization, and other variables.
• The model should include frictions in the setting of wages and should allow for fluctuations in the monopoly power of households.
• The model should incorporate a banking system which is rich enough that one can consider the interactions between real economic activity and various monetary aggregates
such as currency, bank reserves, and demand deposits.
30

See Bordo, Erceg and Evans (2000), Cole and Ohanian (2003), and Temin (1989, 1990).

14

A model that integrates all these features in a coherent way would constitute a credible laboratory for assessing whether an improved monetary policy might have ameliorated the Great
Depression. In this paper we take a step towards constructing such a model by combining
the models of Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2003), BGG and Chari, Christiano, and
Eichenbaum (1995).

The Model Economy

In this section we describe our model economy and display the optimization problems solved
by intermediate- and final-goods firms, entrepreneurs, producers of physical capital, banks,
and households. Final output is produced using the usual Dixit-Stiglitz aggregator of intermediate inputs. Intermediate inputs are produced by monopolists, who set prices using a
variant of the approach described in Calvo (1983). These firms hire the services of capital
and labor, and we assume that a fraction of these costs (“working-capital”) must be financed
in advance through banks. Labor services are an aggregate of specialized services, each of
which is supplied by a monopolist household. Households set wages subject to the type of
frictions modeled in Calvo (1983).31
Capital services are supplied by entrepreneurs, who own the physical stock of capital
and choose how intensely to utilize it. Our model of the entrepreneurs closely follows BGG.
In particular, the entrepreneurs have their own financial wealth, but not enough to finance
the full amount of capital they own. Part of what they own must be financed by bank
loans. Lending to entrepreneurs involves agency costs, because the capital purchased by
entrepreneurs is subject to an idiosyncratic productivity shock. The only way the lender can
observe this shock is by expending valuable resources in monitoring, so that it is eﬃcient
to adopt a lending contract that economizes on monitoring costs. We assume the borrower
receives a standard debt contract, which specifies a loan amount and an amount to be repaid
in the event the borrower is solvent. A borrower who cannot repay is said to be bankrupt,
and turns over everything to the lender, after being monitored. The rate of return paid by
solvent entrepreneurs must be high enough to cover the cost of funds to the bank, as well as
monitoring costs net of whatever the bank can salvage from bankrupt entrepreneurs. The
excess of this rate of return over the cost of funds to the bank is the external finance premium.
Being an endogenous variable, the magnitude of the premium is a function of all the shocks
in the model. Among these, one that plays a notable role is the variance of the idiosyncratic
shock to entrepreneurial productivity. We assume that this is the realization of a stochastic
process. The bank obtains the funds that it lends to entrepreneurs by issuing time deposit
31

This aspect of the model follows Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2003), who in turn build on Erceg,
Henderson, and Levin (2000).

15

contracts to households. Because these contracts pay a nominal non-state contingent return,
the model can at least qualitatively account for the debt deflation phenomenon emphasized
by Fisher (1933), as discussed in the introduction.
As in most models of credit market frictions, there is a tendency for entrepreneurs to
“grow” away from the financial constraint by accumulating enough wealth. To ensure that
the credit market restrictions remain binding, we follow BGG in assuming that a randomly
selected fraction of entrepreneurial financial wealth is destroyed exogenously each period.
The fraction is itself subject to stochastic fluctuations. A jump in the rate of destruction of
entrepreneurial financial wealth resembles in some respects the bursting of a stock market
bubble.
The frictions in the entrepreneurial sector have the eﬀect of amplifying the output eﬀects
of certain types of shocks. This is the “accelerator eﬀect” emphasized by BGG. To see this,
it is useful to understand the evolution of entrepreneurial net worth. In a given period, net
worth is equal to what it was in the previous period, plus earnings from renting capital, plus
the current market value of the stock of capital, minus obligations to banks arising from
past loans. As a result, a shock that reduces the rental rate of capital or its market value
produces a fall in investment by reducing entrepreneurial net worth. Similarly, as noted
above, a shock that reduces the aggregate price level reduces net worth by raising the real
value of entrepreneurial debt payments. Thus, the financial frictions amplify the eﬀects of
shocks that reduce output and either the rental rate of capital or the aggregate price level.
In addition to amplifying the eﬀects of certain shocks originating outside the entrepreneurial
sector, the model also posits new shocks that originate within the sector itself, and which
can be useful for understanding macroeconomic dynamics. A “bursting stock market bubble” has a depressive eﬀect on investment because the destruction of entrepreneurial wealth
inhibits the ability of entrepreneurs to buy capital. Also, an increase in the riskiness of
entrepreneurs leads to a fall in investment because the rise in interest payments to banks
cuts into their net worth.
The actual production of physical capital is carried out by capital-producing firms, which
combine old capital and investment goods to produce new, installed, capital. The production
of new capital involves adjustment costs, so that the price of capital increases with the
amount of capital sold. There are no financing problems or agency costs in the capitalproducing sector. Inputs in this sector are financed out of contemporaneous receipts from
production.
All financial intermediation activities occur in a representative, competitive “bank.” This
bank is involved in two separable activities. In one it makes loans to entrepreneurs, which
are financed by issuing time deposits to households. In the other, it makes working-capital
loans to intermediate-goods producers, which are financed by issuing demand deposits to
16

households. Total demand deposits are composed of these household demand deposits, plus
firm demand deposits created automatically when a bank extends working-capital loans.
Banks are required to set aside a fraction of total demand deposit liabilities in the form
of reserves. Associated with demand deposits is a flow of transactions services. The bank
produces these using a neoclassical production function involving labor, capital, and reserves
in excess of what is required. The presence of excess reserves in the production function is
meant to capture, in a reduced-form way, the liquidity needs that arise in a banking system
where banks clear demand deposit checks among each other. The bank’s assets and liabilities
match in their maturity structure and are risk free.
We now discuss the diﬀerent sectors of the model in more detail.

3.1

Firms

A final good, Yt , is produced by a perfectly competitive, representative firm. It does so by
combining a continuum of intermediate goods, indexed by j ∈ [0, 1], using the technology
Yt =

Here, 1 ≤ λf,t < ∞, and Yjt denotes the time-t input of intermediate good j. Let Pt and
Pjt denote the time-t price of the consumption good and intermediate good j, respectively.
The firm chooses Yjt and Yt to maximize profits, taking prices as given. The parameter,
λf,t , is a realization of a stochastic process, to be discussed below. Because a higher value of
λf,t implies that intermediate goods are less substitutable for each other, intermediate-goods
firms have more market power, the higher is λf,t .
The j th intermediate good is produced by a monopolist who sets its price, Pjt , subject
to Calvo-style frictions that will be described shortly. The intermediate-goods producer is
required to satisfy whatever demand materializes at its posted price. Given quantity demanded, the intermediate-goods producer chooses inputs to minimize costs. The production
function of the j th intermediate good firm is:

where Φ is a fixed cost and Kjt and ljt denote the services of capital and labor. The variable,

The variable, t , is a stationary shock to technology. The time-series representation of

Intermediate-goods firms are competitive in factor markets, where they confront a rental
rate, P rtk , on capital services and a wage rate, Wt , on labor services. Each of these is
expressed in units of money. Also, each firm must finance a fraction, ψk , of its capital
services expenses in advance. Similarly, it must finance a fraction, ψl , of its labor services in
advance. The interest rate it faces for this type of working-capital loan is Rt .
We adopt the variant of Calvo pricing proposed in Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans
(2003). In each period, t, a fraction of intermediate-goods firms, 1 − ξ p , can reoptimize its
price. The complementary fraction must set its price equal to what it was in time-t − 1,
scaled up by the inflation rate from t − 2 to t − 1, π t−1 .

3.2

Capital Producers

There is a large, fixed number of identical capital producers. They are competitive and
take prices as given. They are owned by households, who receive any profits or losses in
the form of lump-sum transfers. Capital producers purchase previously installed capital, x,
and investment goods, It , and combine these to produce new installed capital. Investment
goods are purchased in the goods market at price Pt . The time-t price of previously installed
capital is denoted by QK̄ 0 ,t . New capital, x0 , is produced using the following technology:
x0 = x + F (It , It−1 ).
The presence of lagged investment reflects that there are costs to changing the flow of investment. Since the marginal rate of transformation from previously installed capital to new
capital is unity, the price of new capital is also QK̄ 0 ,t . The firm’s time-t profits are:
Πkt = QK̄ 0 ,t [x + F (It , It−1 )] − QK̄ 0 ,t x − Pt It .
The capital producer’s problem is dynamic because of the adjustment costs. It solves:
(∞
)
X
β j λt+j Πkt+j ,
max Et
{It+j ,xt+j }

j=0

where Et is the expectation conditional on the time-t information set, which includes all
time-t shocks.
Let K̄t+j denote the beginning-of-time t + j physical stock of capital in the economy,
and let δ denote its rate of depreciation. From the capital producer’s problem it is evident
that any value of xt+j whatsoever is profit maximizing. Thus, setting xt+j = (1 − δ)K̄t+j
is consistent with profit maximization and market clearing. The stock of capital evolves as
follows
K̄t+1 = (1 − δ)K̄t + F (It , It−1 ).

3.3

Entrepreneurs

The details are presented in BGG, so our discussion of the entrepreneurs can be brief.
Because of linearity assumptions, aggregate decisions can be represented as functions of
aggregates only. This greatly simplifies the computational analysis. In addition, we exploit
this property of the model in the following presentation. At the end of time-t, the state of
an entrepreneur is summarized by his net worth, Nt+1 (see Figure 2). The net worth, in
combination with a bank loan, is used to purchase the time-t stock of installed capital, K̄t+1 .
After the purchase, each entrepreneur draws an idiosyncratic shock which changes K̄t+1 to
ω K̄t+1 . Here, ω is a unit mean, lognormal random variable distributed independently over
time and across entrepreneurs. The standard-deviation of log(ω) at date t, σ t , is itself a
stochastic process. Although the realization of ω is not known at the time the entrepreneur
makes its capital decision, the value of σt is known. The properties of this random variable
are described below. In a slight abuse of previous notation, we write the distribution function
of ω as Ft :
Pr [ω ≤ x] = Ft (x).
After observing the time-t + 1 aggregate shocks, the entrepreneur decides on the time-t + 1
level of capital utilization, ut+1 , and then rents out capital services, Kt+1 = ut+1 K̄t+1 . High
capital utilization gives rise to high costs in terms of goods, according to the following convex
function:
a(ut+1 )ω K̄t+1 , a0 , a00 > 0.
The entrepreneur chooses ut+1 to solve:
¤

Here, Rt+1
is the average rate of return on capital across all entrepreneurs.
We suppose that Nt+1 < QK̄ 0 ,t K̄t+1 , where QK̄ 0 ,t K̄t+1 is the cost of the capital purchased
by entrepreneurs with net worth, Nt+1 . Since the entrepreneur does not have enough net
worth to pay for his capital, he must borrow the rest:
qt =

Bt+1 = QK̄ 0 ,t K̄t+1 − Nt+1 ≥ 0.
19

(3)

We suppose that the entrepreneur receives a standard debt contract from the bank. This
specifies a loan amount, Bt+1 , and a gross rate of interest, Zt+1 , to be paid if ω is high
enough. Entrepreneurs who draw ω below a cutoﬀ level, ω̄ t+1 , cannot pay this interest rate
and must give everything they have to the bank. The cutoﬀ is defined as follows:
¡
¢
k
QK̄ 0 ,t K̄t+1 = Zt+1 Bt+1 .

(4)

The bank finances its time-t loans to entrepreneurs, Bt+1 , by borrowing from households.
e
, that is not contingent
We assume the bank pays households a nominal rate of return, Rt+1
upon the realization of t + 1 shocks. As noted above, this is the assumption that allows our
model to articulate Fisher’s (1933) “debt deflation” hypothesis. With this assumption, we
depart from BGG, who assume that the return received by the household is noncontingent
in real terms. We suspect that our specification is easier to reconcile with competition in
banking than BGG’s. In an environment like ours, which is dominated by shocks which
drive consumption and the price level in the same direction, a nominally non-state contingent return to households has the eﬀect of shifting business cycle risk from households to
entrepreneurs. This is eﬃcient and an outcome of competition when, as is the case in our
model, entrepreneurs are risk-neutral and households are risk-averse. We have not explored
whether the distribution of risk associated with our market arrangements is optimal or even
close to optimal. We leave this for future work.
In the usual way, the parameters of the entrepreneur’s debt contract are chosen to maximize entrepreneurial utility, subject to zero profits in each state of nature for the bank and
e
be uncontingent upon time-t + 1 shocks. This implies that Zt+1
to the requirement that Rt+1
and ω̄ t+1 are both functions of time-t + 1 aggregate shocks. A feature of the loan contract is
that
QK̄ 0 ,t K̄t+1
Nt+1
is independent of the entrepreneur’s net worth. Aggregation in the model is trivial because
of the fact that borrowing and capital purchases are proportional to an entrepreneur’s level
of net worth.
The law of motion for aggregate Nt+1 is

QK̄ 0 ,t−1 K̄t − N̄t
Here, γ t reflects that at the end of the period, after the entrepreneur has sold his capital,
paid oﬀ his debt and earned rental income, he exits the economy with probability 1 − γ t . At
the same time a fraction, 1 − γ t , of entrepreneurs enters. The fraction, γ t , who survive and
20

the fraction, 1 − γ t , who enter both receive a transfer, Wte . Without this transfer, entering
entrepreneurs would have no net worth, and so they would not be able to buy any capital,
ever. Also, among the γ t entrepreneurs who survive there are some who are bankrupt and
have no net worth. Without a transfer they, too, would never again be able to buy capital.
The first term in braces in (5) represents the revenues from selling capital, plus the rental
income of capital, net of the costs of utilization, averaged across all entrepreneurs. The object
in square brackets is the average gross rate of return paid by all entrepreneurs on time-t − 1
loans, (QK̄ 0 ,t−1 K̄t − N̄t ). This aggregates over payments received from entrepreneurs who are
bankrupt, as well as those who are not. The (1 − γ t ) entrepreneurs who are selected for
death, consume:
Pt Cte = Θ(1 − γ t )Vt ,
where Vt is their net worth. In practice, we set Θ = 0.
Following BGG, we define the “external finance premium” as the term involving µ in
square brackets in (5). It is the diﬀerence between the “internal cost of funds,” 1 + Rte , and
the expected cost of borrowing to an entrepreneur. The reason for calling 1 + Rte the internal
cost of funds is that, in principle, one could imagine the entrepreneur using his net worth to
acquire time deposits, instead of physical capital (the model does not formally allow this).
In this sense, the opportunity cost of the entrepreneur’s own funds is 1 + Rte .

3.4

Banks

We assume that there is a continuum of identical, competitive banks. Banks issue deposit
liabilities, Dth , to households. Part of this is set aside in the form of reserves, and the other
is used to finance working-capital loans. Working capital loans are extended to firms in
the form of demand deposits, Dtf . The management of total deposit liabilities, Dt , requires
capital services, Ktb , labor, ltb , and excess reserves, Etr , according to the following technology:

Dt = Dth + Dtf .
In (6), 0 < α < 1, and xb is a constant. In addition, ξ t ∈ (0, 1) is a shock to the relative value
of excess reserves, Etr . The stochastic process governing this shock will be discussed later.
As noted above, we include excess reserves as an input to the production of demand deposit
services as a reduced-form way to capture the precautionary motive of a bank concerned
about the possibility of unexpected withdrawals.
Demand deposits pay interest, Rat . We denote the interest rate on working-capital loans,
net of interest on the associated demand deposits, by Rt . Since firms receive interest on
21

the deposits associated with their loans, the gross interest payment on loans is Rt + Rat .
The maturity of time-t working-capital loans and the associated demand deposit liabilities
coincide. A time-t working-capital loan is extended prior to production in time-t and pays
oﬀ after production in time-t. The household deposits funds into the bank before production
in time-t and liquidates the deposit after production occurs.
Turning to time deposits, we assume the bank faces no costs for maintaining this type of
liability. The maturity structure of time deposits coincides with that of the standard debt
contract oﬀered to entrepreneurs. Thus, time deposits and entrepreneurial loans are created
at the end of a given period’s goods market. This is when newly constructed capital is
sold by capital producers to entrepreneurs. Time deposits and entrepreneurial loans pay oﬀ
near the end of next period’s goods market, when the entrepreneurs sell their undepreciated
capital to capital producers (who use it as raw material in the production of new capital).
The timing of the payoﬀ on the entrepreneurial loan coincides with the timing of the payoﬀ
on time deposits. The maturity structure of the two types of bank liabilities can be seen in
Figure 3.
The entrepreneur/time-deposit side and the working-capital/demand-deposit side of the
bank can be considered separately. The former was considered in the previous subsection.
The profit maximization problem arising from the latter is:

subject to (6), where

¡
¢
Etr = Dth + Ft − τ Dth + Stw .

Here, Ktb and ltb denote capital and labor services hired by the banking sector. Note our
assumption that a fraction of these must be paid in advance with working-capital. Also, Stw
represents working-capital loans, so that Stw = Dtf . The term, Ft , denotes loans of reserves
between banks. Since banks are all identical, equilibrium requires Ft = 0. Still, the presence
of Ft allows us to define the interest rate on interbank loans, Rtb .
The clearing condition in the market for working-capital loans is:
Stw = ψl Wt lt + ψk Pt rtk Kt ,

(7)

where lt and Kt denote economy-wide aggregate labor and capital services. Here, Stw represents the supply of loans, and the terms on the right of the equality in (7) represent total
demand.

3.5

Households

There is a continuum of households, each indexed by j ∈ (0, 1). Households consume; decide
how to allocate their wealth between demand deposits, currency, and time deposits; and
supply a specialized labor input, hjt . Since the household is a monopoly supplier of its labor
service, it can set its wage rate. We assume that it faces Calvo (1983)-type frictions in the
setting of this wage. Since this uncertainty is idiosyncratic in nature, diﬀerent households
work diﬀerent amounts and earn diﬀerent wage rates. So, in principle, they are also heterogeneous with respect to consumption and asset holdings. A straightforward extension of
the arguments in Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000) establishes that the existence of statecontingent securities ensures that in equilibrium households are homogeneous with respect
to consumption and asset holdings. We assume, though we do not discuss, the presence of
these securities. Given these considerations, our notation assumes that households are homogeneous with respect to consumption and asset holdings, and heterogeneous with respect
to the wage rate that they earn and the hours they worked.
The preferences of the j th household are given by:

where Ct denotes time-t consumption; υ t is a unit-mean liquidity preference shock; and ζ t is
a shock with mean unity to the preference for leisure. This shock is isomorphic to a shock
to the household’s degree of monopoly power in the supply of hjt . When b > 0, (8) allows
for habit formation in consumption.32 The term in square brackets captures the notion that
currency, Mt , and demand deposits, Dth , contribute to utility by facilitating transactions. It
is because υ t aﬀects the magnitude of these non-pecuniary liquidity services that we refer to
it as a liquidity preference shock.
We now discuss the household’s time-t sources and uses of funds. At the beginning of the
period, the household is in possession of the economy’s stock of high-powered money, Mtb ,
which it splits into currency, Mt , and deposits with the bank, At , subject to the following
liquidity constraint:
(9)
Mtb ≥ Mt + At .

The central bank credits the household’s bank deposit, Dth , with Xt units of high-powered
32

Various authors, such as Fuhrer (2000), McCallum and Nelson (1999), and Christiano, Eichenbaum, and
Evans (2003), have argued that b > 0 is important for understanding the monetary transmission mechanism
in the postwar period. In addition, habit formation is useful for understanding other aspects of the economy,
including the size of the premium on equity (see, for example, Boldrin, Christiano and Fisher 2001.)

Dth = At + Xt .

(10)

As already mentioned, the household receives interest, Rat , on these deposits. Additional
sources of funds include profits from producers of capital, from banks, from intermediategoods firms, and from the net payoﬀ on the state contingent securities mentioned above.
Households also receive lump-sum transfers corresponding to the net worth of the entrepreneurs
who exit the economy in the current period. Finally, the households pay a lump-sum tax to
finance transfer payments to surviving entrepreneurs and to the newly born entrepreneurs.

where Lumpt summarizes the lump sum transfers. The household’s problem is to maximize

We now turn to the way the j th household sets its time-t wage, Wj,t . We follow closely the
setup in Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000). In time-t, the household can, with probability
1 − ξ w , choose its wage rate optimally. It turns out that each household that sets its wage
optimally sets it to the same value, which we denote, W̃t . With probability ξ w , the household
must follow a rule of thumb by setting its time-t wage to what it was in the previous period,
scaled up by π t−1 µz . That is, for these households, Wj,t = π t−1 µz Wj,t−1 . The household must
in each period satisfy its demand curve:

The household takes the aggregate wage and employment index as given. The household
that reoptimizes its wage, W̃t , does so by optimizing (8) subject to (11) and the various
frictions discussed above. In the linear approximation of our model’s solution, λw and the
preference parameter, ζ, are observationally equivalent. From here on, we treat ζ as the
realization of a stochastic process and refer to it as a measure of household labor market
power. For further details on the sticky wage part of our model, see Christiano, Eichenbaum,
and Evans (2003) or Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000).

Final-Goods-Market Clearing

Here, we develop the aggregate resource constraint, relating the quantity of final goods
produced to the quantity of aggregate labor and capital services, as well as to the distribution
of production among intermediate-goods firms and to the distribution of employment among
households. Our approach follows Yun (1996). In particular,

The endogenous variable, ν t , represents the fraction of aggregate labor and capital services

integrals of Wjt over all j, and similarly for Pt∗ and Pt . The scalars, wt∗ and p∗t , capture the
loss of final output that occurs when resources are not evenly distributed across sectors, as
eﬃciency requires. There is no eﬃciency loss when all wages and intermediate-goods prices
are equal, so that p∗t = wt∗ = 1. The price and wage frictions that we assume imply that
p∗t = wt∗ = 1 only holds in a nonstochastic steady state. The reasoning in Yun (1996) can
be used to show that in the type of linear approximation about steady state that we study
here, we can set p∗t = wt∗ = 1.We do this from here on.
To complete our discussion, final goods are allocated to monitoring for banks, utilization

Exogenous Shocks

There are eight exogenous shocks in the model. These are the monopoly power parameter, λf,t , corresponding to intermediate-goods firms; the parameter controlling bank demand
for excess reserves, ξ t ; the parameter controlling household preferences for currency versus demand deposits, θt ; the monopoly power parameter for household labor supply, ζ t ;
the parameter governing household preference for liquidity, υ t ; the productivity shock to
intermediate-goods firms, t ; the shock to the riskiness of entrepreneurs, σ t ; and the parameter governing the survival probability of entrepreneurs, γ t .
Three of our variables, γ t , ξ t , and θt , must lie inside the unit interval. Let yt denote
one of these variables. We ensure that yt lies inside the unit interval by assuming that it is
generated by a stochastic process, xt , via the following transformation:
yt =

1
.
1 + exp(−xt )

(15)

Note that xt ∈ (−∞, ∞) maps yt into the unit interval. If we let dxt denote a small
perturbation of xt about its nonstochastic steady state value, and let ŷt = dyt /y, where y is
the nonstochastic steady state of yt , then
dyt = y(1 − y)dxt .

(16)

For the cases in which yt is γ t , ξ t or θt , we allow dxt to have a first-order autoregressive,
moving average (ARMA(1,1)) representation. We allow λ̂f,t , υ̂ t , ζ̂ t , and ˆt to have ARMA(1,1)
representations. Consider, for example, λ̂f,t . The joint evolution of this variable and its
monetary response, xf,t , are given by:
⎛

0 θ1f θ2f
θ0f ϕ̂f t
xf,t
xf,t−1
Because at time-t, σ̂ t−1 enters the model [see (5)], and because of the nature of the computational methods we use to solve the model, we find it convenient to handle σ̂t somewhat
diﬀerently. In particular,
⎞ ⎡

where ρ is 24 by 24 and D is 24 by 8.

Monetary Policy

The ability of the monetary authority to aﬀect the economy stems from its control over the
monetary base, which has the following law of motion:
b
= Mtb (1 + xt ).
Mt+1

Here, xt is the net growth rate of the monetary base. In the literature, monetary policy is
modeled in a variety of ways. For example, policy is often represented as an interest rate
target that varies with economic conditions in a particular way. The notion is that the
monetary authority manipulates the monetary base to ensure that the target is achieved.
Specification of the target is often controversial. For example, “economic conditions” may be
represented by deviations from a long-term trend, or by deviations from some flexible price
level of output. Moreover, in models like ours with endogenous state variables, the “flexible
level of output” is itself controversial.33 For the purpose of estimating our model, we do not
need to take a stand on what the target of monetary policy is, or how that target varies with
the state of the economy. We pursue the insight that whatever rule the monetary authority
follows, it corresponds to a particular reduced-form feedback function from the shocks in
the economy to the monetary base. It implies such a representation even if the monetary
authority does not actually see the shocks.
Let x̂t denote the percent deviation of xt from its mean value of x, so that x̂t = (xt −x)/x.
Our reduced form representation of monetary policy has the following form:
x̂t =

p
X

xit ,

i=0

where xit is the component of money growth reflecting the ith element in ϕt and:
xit = θ2i xi,t−1 + θ0i ϕi,t ,

(18)

for i = 0, 1, ..., p, with θ00 ≡ 1. In our analysis, p = 8, and we suppose that for i = 0, x0,t
represents an exogenous component to monetary policy. Although we set this to zero in
the estimation of our model, a simulation of the response of our model to monetary policy
shocks will nevertheless be useful for interpreting the results of our counterfactual analysis.
It is also useful to spell out in more detail the response of the monetary base to a shock.

Equilibrium and Model Solution

We adopt a standard sequence-of-markets equilibrium concept, and we use the method in
Christiano (2002), described in the appendix, to develop a linear approximation to the
equilibrium quantities and prices. The solution is a set of matrices, A, B and a core set of
23 endogenous variables contained in the vector, z̃t , satisfying
z̃t = Az̃t−1 + BΨt .

(19)

Here, A is 23 by 23 and B is 23 by 24 for i = 1, 2. The vector, z̃t , is defined in the appendix.
Each element in z̃t is expressed as a percent deviation from a steady state value, so that, in
nonstochastic steady state, z̃t = 0. From the variables in z̃t and the various equilibrium relationships in the model, it is possible to compute any desired equilibrium variable. Suppose
these are contained in the vector, Xt . After linearization, let the relationship of Xt to z̃t and
Ψt be expressed as follows:
Xt = α + τ zt + τ̄ zt−1 + τ s Ψt ,

28

(20)

where α, τ , τ̄ , and τ s are functions of the model parameter values and its steady state. The
set of variables of interest in our analysis is:

Here, Vt1 and Vtb are the time-t velocity of M1 and the monetary base, respectively. Also,
dct and drt represent the currency to demand deposit ratio and the bank reserves to demand
deposit ratio, respectively. As noted in section 3.4, Rtb is the interest rate on interbank loans.
It is determined by an arbitrage condition.34 Finally, Pte is the external finance premium,
which was discussed at the end of section 3.3.
In our analysis we use the value of equity as measured by the real value of the DOW, as
an indicator of Nt+1 /Pt . This deserves comment because our model of entrepreneurs does not
allow any role for equity finance. The entrepreneurs in our model resemble small shopkeepers
and farmers, who do not issue equity and who must finance their ownership of capital with a
combination of their own net worth and bank loans. Although it is probably true that most
capital was owned by small proprietors like this in the 1920s and 1930s, we believe it is hard
to obtain good, direct estimates of their net worth. Our analysis in eﬀect assumes that the
DOW constitutes a useful, albeit indirect, measure.

Model Estimation and Fit

Our aim in choosing parameter values is to produce a quantitative model that resembles key
aspects of the U.S. economy in the 1920s and 1930s. This is what we need in order to have a
credible laboratory for evaluating the consequences of alternative, counterfactual, monetary
policies. The model parameters are divided into two sets: (i) those that govern the evolution
34

The arbitrage condition is:

where her ,t denotes the derivative of the right side of (6) with respect to real excess reserves, ert = Etr /Pt .

29

of the exogenous shocks and the monetary response to them, and (ii) the rest. We begin
with the latter. We then estimate the stochastic parameters in (i) by a maximum likelihood procedure. Ideally, we would have estimated all parameters simultaneously. However,
computational challenges make this strategy less than straightforward, and we leave such
an exercise for future work. After discussing the model parameter estimates, we discuss the
quality of model fit.

4.1

Parameters of the Nonstochastic Part of the Model

The nonstochastic model parameters are listed in Table 2, and various properties of the
model’s steady state are reported in Tables 3-4. In many cases, the corresponding sample
averages for U.S. data from both the 1920s and the postwar period are also reported. Our
procedure for computing the steady state is discussed in the Appendix.
To compute the steady state, we found it convenient to proceed by specifying some of the
economically endogenous variables to be exogenous. In particular, we assigned values to the
steady state ratio of currency-to-monetary base, m, the steady state rental rate of capital,
rk , the steady state share of capital and labor in goods production, ν, and the steady state
share of government consumption of goods, G/Y. These were set to m = 0.70, rk = 0.043,
ν = 0.99, and G/Y = 0.07. The currency-to-base ratio is a little high relative to the data
from the 1920s. The value of rk may also be a little high because the model implies a value
of the capital output ratio that is a little low, compared with our data on the 1920s (see
Table 3). To make these four variables exogenous for purposes of computing the steady state
required making four model parameters endogenous. For this purpose, we chose ψL , xb , ξ,
and g.
The model parameters in Table 2 are organized by sector. Turning to the household
sector, values for β, λw , ξ w , σ L , and b were taken from Altig et al. (2003). The parameters,
θ, υ, and σq were set exogenously. Regarding the goods-producing sector, all but one of the
parameters were taken from Altig et al. (2003). The exception is ψk , which does not appear
in Altig et al. (2003). We set this exogenously.
The Calvo price and wage stickiness parameters, ξ p and ξ w , imply that the amount of
time between reoptimization of prices and wages is 1/2 year and 1 year, respectively. As
noted in Altig et al. (2003), these values are consistent with recent survey evidence on price
frictions.
Our selection of parameter values for the entrepreneurial sector is based on the calibration
discussion in BGG. Following them, we assume that the idiosyncratic shock to entrepreneurs,
ω, has a lognormal distribution. We impose on our calibration the condition that the number
of bankruptcies in steady state corresponds roughly to the number reported by BGG for the
post- World War II period. In particular, we set F (ω̄) to 0.008, so that, on average, 0.8
30

percent of firms fail to meet their debt obligations in a given quarter. To understand how
we were able to specify F (ω̄) exogenously, recall that the lognormal distribution has two
parameters - the mean and variance of log ω. We set the mean of ω to unity. We are left
with one degree of freedom, the variance of log ω. Conditional on the other parameters of
the model, this can be set to ensure the exogenously set value of F (ω̄). The value of this
variance is reported in Table 2. Finally, as noted above, the two parameters of the banking
sector are an output of the steady state calculations.
The steady state implications of the model can be compared with the corresponding
empirical quantities in Tables 3 - 5. There are five things worth emphasizing about Table 3.
First, as noted above, the capital-to-output ratio in the model is a little low. Corresponding
to this, the investment-to-output ratio is low and the consumption-to-output ratio is high.
Second, note that N/(K̄ − N) is roughly unity. This corresponds well with the data if the
equity to debt ratio of publicly owned firms corresponds well to the net worth to bank loans
ratio of small, wholly owned proprietorships, such as gasoline stations and restaurants. As
discussed above, the latter are the empirical counterparts of the entrepreneurs in our model.
Third, the relative size of the banking sector in the model, which is quite small, conforms
roughly with the size of the actual banking sector in the 1920s. Fourth, although we have
not obtained data on the fraction of GDP used up in bankruptcy costs, we suspect that the
relatively low number of 0.84 percent is not be far from the mark. Finally, note that while
inflation in the model is low by postwar standards, it is somewhat higher than what it was
in the 1920s.
Table 4 reports the consolidated asset and liability accounts for the banks in the model.
Several things are worth noting here. First, in the model most demand deposits are created
in the process of extending working-capital loans. These deposits are what we call “firm
demand deposits,” and they are roughly 7 times as large as the quantity of demand deposits
created when households deposit their financial assets with banks (i.e., “household demand
deposits”). We are not aware of data that would allow us to evaluate this implication of
the model. Second, the results in the table indicate that the amount of bank reserves in the
model matches reasonably well with the corresponding quantity in the data. For example,
in the model excess reserves are 2.2 percent of the sum of bank reserves and working-capital
loans. We estimate that the analogous number for the U.S. economy in the 1920s is only
slightly larger, around 3.4 percent.
Table 5 reports various monetary and interest rate statistics. The left set of columns
shows that the basic orders of magnitude are on track: Base velocity and M1 velocity in the
model match up reasonably well with the data. The ratio of currency to demand deposits
is also reasonable. However, the fraction of currency in the monetary base is high, as noted
above. The interest rate implications of the model accord reasonably well with the data.
31

However, the interbank loan rate is a little high.
Taken together, these results suggest to us that the steady state implications of the model
correspond reasonably well with the data.

4.2

Parameters of Exogenous Stochastic Processes

We estimate the stochastic parameters of the model using quarterly observations covering
the period 1923I-1939IV on the data in (21). We adopt a standard state-observer setup in
supposing that the measured data corresponds to Xt plus an error that is independently
distributed over time and across variables. We follow convention in referring to this error
as “measurement error,” although we actually think of it as some combination of literal
measurement error and model-specification error. We then estimate the unknown parameters
using a standard maximum-likelihood procedure. This part of our estimation procedure
focuses only on fluctuations. We abstract from means at both the parameter estimation
and model diagnostic stages. At the estimation stage we do so by subtracting the sample
means from the data and setting the model mean to zero. When we simulate the model
to determine how well it matches the data, we impose the condition that the mean in the
model coincides with the mean in the data.
4.2.1

Methodology

For convenience, we describe our system using the notation in Hamilton (1994, chapter 13).
Let the state vector, ξ t , be:
⎞
⎛
z̃t
ξ t = ⎝ z̃t−1 ⎠ .
Ψt

Then, the state equation, which summarizes (17) and (19), is

.

Note from (20) that Hξ t = Xt , apart from the constant vector, α. We interpret the 13
variables on which we have observations as yt in (24).
To complete the description of the state space system, we must also specify the variance
covariance matrix of vt and of the measurement error, wt . We suppose that both these objects
are iid and diagonal. In addition, we suppose that wt is orthogonal to yt and ξ t at all leads
and lags.35 The variance covariance matrix of wt is R. The variance covariance matrix of vt
has some structure in our setting:

⎛
⎡

Our system is completely characterized by (F, H, R, Vϕ ). For our purposes here, the free
parameters are the diagonal elements of Vϕ and R, as well as the parameters of the timeseries representations of the exogenous shocks, which are contained in ρ and D. There are four
parameters per shock: an autoregressive and variance term for the time-series representation
of the shock, as well as two parameters governing the monetary policy response to each shock
(we model the shocks and monetary responses as first-order autoregressions). In addition,
for each of the 13 variables in yt there is one measurement error variance. Since there are 8
shocks, there is a total of 37 free parameters for the estimation. Denote these by the vector,
Υ. Given the values assigned to the other parameters of the model, (F, H, R, Vϕ ) can be
constructed once values are assigned to Υ. We choose these values to maximize the Gaussian
density function, as discussed in Hamilton (1994, section 13.4). In this analysis we ignore the
levels of variables by removing the sample mean from the data and replacing the constant
term in (20) by a vector of zeros (this was done implicitly in the definition of yt in (24).
4.2.2

Results

Tables 6 and 7 report our estimation results. Table 6 displays the estimates of the time-series
representations of the exogenous shocks and the associated monetary policy responses. Table
7 presents the estimated standard-deviation of the measurement errors, wt . We now discuss
these in turn.
Exogenous Shocks and Monetary Policy Response
35

These assumptions make it hard to interpret the shock, wt , literally as measurement error. For data such
as aggregate output it seems likely that statistical agencies apply some optimal smoothing before release,
and this has the consequence that measurement error in the published data are correlated with true values.

33

There are three things worth noting in Table 6. First, in several cases, the autoregressive
root of a shock was driven very nearly to unity (numbers in the table are rounded). This
is how the model captures the substantial, trend-like persistence in the data. Second, to
understand the magnitude of the innovation standard-deviations, it is useful to express them
in terms of their impact on the level of the shock itself.36 Thus, Table 6 displays the steady
state value of each shock, as well as its position after a positive one-standard-deviation
innovation. For example, the steady state value of the firm markup, λf , is 1.20, and its value
after a one-standard-deviation innovation is 1.21. In almost all cases, the displacement is
relatively small. An exception is the shock to γ t , where a positive one-standard-deviation
positive innovation drives it a little above its upper limit of unity. (The fact that it exceeds
its upper bound reflects a breakdown in the accuracy of (16) as an approximation to (15).)
Overall, we were frankly somewhat surprised that these innovations seem to be of reasonable
magnitude, despite the enormous variation in the data of the 1930s. Third, the response of
monetary policy to the various shocks is relatively weak. The strongest response appears to
be to the technology shock. And, as we show below, this response is not very strong either.
Because there is a large literature focused on the estimation and analysis of aggregate
technology shocks, it is of interest to discuss the parameters pertaining to the technology
shock, t , in greater detail. For comparability with other studies, it is useful to consider
the impact of t on GNP in a steady state, holding fixed the utilization of capital and labor
resources, and holding fixed the amount of resources absorbed by bankruptcy. After scaling
by zt , GNP is:
1
Ytz = t F (ut , k̄t , ν kt , lt ) − φ − dt − a(ut ) k̄t ,
µz
where dt is the resources used up in bankruptcy (see the Appendix for an explicit representation of dt ). Here, the function F is the production function of the typical intermediate-goods
producer, (2), after scaling. The fact that aggregate output is a function of aggregate quantities alone reflects that in a steady state, the nature of our price and wage updating rules
leads to symmetric behavior across all households and intermediate-goods firms. Totally
diﬀerentiating the above expression with respect to Ytz and t and holding all other variables
fixed at their steady state values, we obtain Y z Ŷtz = ˆt F , where Ŷtz ≡ dYtz /Y z and ˆt = d t
(recall, = 1). We obtain a simple expression for F/Y z by noting, first, that Y z = F −φ −d.
Second, our assumption that intermediate-goods profits are zero in steady state implies that
firm revenues equal firm costs, so that F − φ = F/λf , where λf is the reciprocal of real
marginal cost (i.e., it is the markup). Combining the previous two expressions we obtain
36

Suppose the shock of interest is yt . In the case of shocks with hats, a one-standard-deviation innovation
represents a perturbation to ŷt = (yt − y)/y, which translates into a σ × y shock to yt . So, for a variable with
a hat, Table 6 displays (y, y + σy). For a variable with a d, a one-standard-deviation innovation represents
a y(1 − y)σ shock to yt . So, for a variable with a d, Table 6 displays (y, y(1 − y)σ).

34

Y z = F/λf − d, so that:
Ŷtz =

F
λf (Y z + d)
ˆ
=
ˆt ≈ λf ˆt ,
t
Yz
Yz

since d/Y z is small (see Table 3). So, a one percent change in t results, approximately, in a
1.2 percent change in gross national product (recall, from Table 2, λf = 1.2). According to
Table 6, an innovation in t has a standard-deviation of 0.0031, which translates into an innovation in GNP of 0.0037. This is about one-half of Prescott’s (1986) estimate of 0.00763 for
the standard-deviation of the innovation to the aggregate technology shock. That Prescott’s
estimate should be larger than ours is perhaps not surprising, since he attributes the entire
Solow residual to exogenous technology, whereas our Solow residual includes sources of endogenous variation, in part because we include variable capital utilization in our model. Our
estimate of the autocorrelation of the technology resembles Prescott’s in that both are high.
Turning to the monetary response to shocks, note from Table 6 that this is quite small in
most cases. We briefly discuss the policy response to an innovation in technology, because
that has been the subject of a literature. Table 6 indicates that a one-standard-deviation
innovation in t produces an immediate increase of 0.13 percent in the monetary base. Thereafter, the monetary base continues to rise until eventually it is roughly 0.96 percent higher
than it would have been in the absence of a shock. That monetary policy accommodates aggregate technology is consistent with the findings for the postwar period in Altig et al. (2003)
and Gali, Lopez-Sadilo and Valles (2003). However, our estimated response is very weak.
In particular, the dynamic response of aggregate variables such as output, consumption,
employment, capital utilization, and investment are roughly the same, whether monetary
policy responds or not. Either way, all these variables respond positively, in a hump-shaped
pattern to a shock. In the absence of monetary accommodation, the response is slightly
weaker, and in the period of the shock the responses of capital utilization and employment
are actually slightly negative.
Measurement Error
To understand the estimates in Table 7, it is useful to also consider the results in Figure
4. The thirteen panels in that figure display the raw data, yt , t = 1, ..., T, where t = 1
corresponds to 1924QI and t = T corresponds to 1939QIV. The relatively smooth line in
the figures displays the projection of Xt , for each t, on the entire data set, Ω = y1 , ..., yT .
To compute this projection, E (ξ t |Ω) , we used the two-sided Kalman smoothing algorithm
(see, e.g., Hamilton 1994.) We then formed E(Xt | Ω) = H × E(ξ t |Ω). Prior to graphing
the model’s simulated data, we adjusted the data so that the sample mean in the simulated
data coincides with the sample mean of the actual data. This is consistent with our overall
35

strategy for estimating the stochastic part of the model, which ignores the diﬀerence between
the mean in the data and in the model.
In addition to the projection interpretation, there is another interpretation of E(Xt | Ω)
that is more convenient for our purposes. To see this, note first that one can obtain an
estimate of the economic shocks, E(ϕt |Ω), by projecting both sides of (22) onto Ω :
E(vt |Ω) = E(ξ t |Ω) − F × E(ξ t−1 |Ω)
and making use of (23).37 The smooth data in Figure 4 can also be interpreted as the
dynamic response of our model economy to the time-series of estimated shocks, E(ϕt |Ω),
t = 1, ..., T. This is the interpretation that we adopt in the remainder of this paper.
The vertical distance between the line depicting the raw data and the model simulation
represents an estimate of the measurement error, wt , in the state-observer system in section
4.2.1. The size of the measurement error varies substantially across variables. For example,
in three cases - log (Nt+1 / (Pt Yt )) , log(lt ), and Rtb − wt is so small that the two lines in
the graph essentially coincide. According to Table 7, the maximum-likelihood estimate of
the standard-deviation of the measurement error in these variables is 0.017, 0.00014, and
0.0000034, respectively. (The actual standard errors of the vertical distances in Figure 4 are
displayed in parentheses in Table 7, and these correspond roughly to the maximum-likelihood
estimates.) At the other extreme lie the variables from the national income and product
accounts: the growth rate of GNP, the investment-to-output ratio and the consumptionto-output ratio. Measurement error is estimated to account for 73, 15, and 46 percent of
the variance in these variables, respectively. To the extent that we interpret these errors
as model-specification error, they may at first seem large enough to be a source of concern
about the quality of model fit. We discuss model fit in the next subsection.

4.3

General Observations about Model Fit

To assess model fit, we converted the variables that appear as ratios and growth rates in
Figure 4 into levels. The results are shown in Figure 5, where the variables in Figure 4 that
were not transformed are reproduced for convenience. Note how the basic simulation results
resemble the actual data remarkably closely. The failures of the model captured by the large
measurement errors in Table 7 appear to be concentrated in the high-frequency components
of the data.
There are some weaknesses in the model. For example, consumption does not fall enough.
In addition, the fall in output and investment are also not quite large enough. Interestingly,
37

Note from (23) that there is considerable structure on vt . The Kalman filter algorithm produces E(vt |Ω)
that respects this structure. Thus, although there are many ways to recover E(ϕt |Ω) from E(vt |Ω), they all
produce the same result.

36

the model’s real wage exhibits excessive growth during the contraction phase of the Great
Depression. Although the degree of wage rigidity in the model is by some measures quite
modest, this evidence suggests the model might perform better with somewhat less rigidity.

5

The U.S. Great Depression from the Perspective of
the Model

This section studies the estimated economic shocks and considers their role in the dynamics
of the Great Depression. The time-series of the eight shocks are displayed in Figure 6. In
discussing these shocks, it is useful to organize them into three groups: real shocks, financial
shocks, and monetary shocks.
The real shocks include the technology shock and the variables that control firm and
household market power, λf,t and ζ t . Of these, only ζ t plays an important role. Its persistent
rise helps the model account for the weakness in employment during the recovery phase of
the Great Depression. Our analysis is consistent with the conclusion of Prescott (1999) and
Cole and Ohanian (1999, 2003) that the failure of hours worked to rise in the late 1930s
reflected changes in the institutions of labor markets which had the eﬀect of increasing the
market power of workers. At the same time, ζ t seems to have had little to do the with
contraction phase of the Great Depression. This is true also for our two financial market
shocks, σ t and γ t .
Finally, we consider three monetary shocks: bank demand for reserves, ξ t , household
money demand, θt , and the household liquidity preference shock, υ t . The last shock stands
out above all our other shocks in terms of its role in accounting for the contraction phase of
the Great Depression. We provide a detailed analysis of the transmission of this shock.
A crude summary of our model’s account of the Great Depression is as follows. Much of
the contraction phase is due to a rise in the liquidity preference shock, υ t . A notable feature
of the expansion phase is the absence of a substantial recovery in employment. According
to the model, this is due to a persistent increase in the labor market power of households.
We find both of these implications reasonable, and they build confidence that this is a useful
model for analysis of counterfactual monetary policy.

5.1

Real Shocks

Our analysis indicates that the role of fluctuations in technology in the Great Depression is
very small. The technology shock, t , drops only about 1 percent from 1929 to 1933. The
third row of graphs in Figure 7 displays the dynamic behavior of output, employment, the
price level, and investment when the only shock is our estimated technology shock. The

37

figures show that the technology shock contributes almost nothing to variation about trend
in output, the price level, and investment.38
Consider firm market power next. Our estimated λf,t is high before 1929 and then
drops roughly four percent to a lower level, where it is also more volatile (see Figure 6).
In results not shown here, we found that our estimated λf,t ’s play only a minor role in
the dynamics of the Great Depression. Although a drop in this variable helps somewhat
towards explaining the drop in the price level, the implied increase in competition has the
counterfactual implication that output and employment are strong. We presume this is the
reason our econometric procedure chose to assign a small role to λf,t .
According to Figure 6, our estimate of households’ labor market power, ζ t , increased
sharply by 50-60 percent in the period 1929 to 1933. After this, the estimated ζ t stabilizes.
It is a challenge to find an economically interesting interpretation of the rise in ζ t from
1929 to 1933. Recall that we have described two interpretations of ζ t . Under one, ζ t is a
measure of the market power of workers. But to interpret the low level of employment in the
early 1930s, for the given real wage, as reflecting increased market power of workers seems
implausible. For example, Goldin (2000, Figure 9) shows that union membership remained
stable from the mid-1920s until well into the 1930s. As noted above, ζ t can alternatively be
interpreted as reflecting an increased aversion in utility for work. At best, this interpretation
needs greater elaboration than is provided in our model. Although the rise in ζ t during the
period 1929 to 1933 is hard to interpret, the fact that it is high in the late 1930s is easy
to interpret. This is the time when the New Deal legislation was passed to give greater
bargaining power to workers (Kennedy 1999.)
It is easy to verify that the 60 percent rise in ζ t and the 4 percent drop in λf,t can
roughly account for the persistent 20 percent drop in employment in a model like ours.
For example, consider the version of our model with no fixed costs, money, variable capital
utilization, investment-adjustment costs, working-capital, agency costs, growth, or banking
system. The resource constraint and utility function for this model are:
ct + kt+1 − (1 − δ)kt = ktα lt1−α ,

u(c, l) = log(c − bc−1 ) − ζl2 /2.

It is easy to verify that, in steady state:

The analysis of TFP in a previous section suggests that if TFP had been included in the data used for
estimation, the role assigned to technology might have been greater.

The second relationship uses β = 1.03−.25 , λf = 1.2, α = 1/3, and δ = 0.10/4. Evidently, a
one percent change in λf has a four times larger impact on employment than a one percent
change in ζ. Still, the magnitude of the change in ζ is so much greater that it dominates.
In particular, the above expression suggests that the 60 percent rise in ζ alone drives down
employment by 30 percent, while the 4 percent fall in λf stimulates employment by about 8
percent. The net eﬀect, 22 percent, corresponds well with the observation that employment
in 1939 was about 20 percent lower than it was in 1929.
Figure 7 displays the behavior of our model in response to the ζ t shock. The first row of
figures displays the dynamic simulation of output, employment, investment, and the price
level in response to our estimated time-series of ζ t . (The dotted line reports the model’s
simulation in response to all shocks, for convenient comparison.) Note that ζ t is the only
shock that can account for the fact that employment is substantially lower in 1939 than in
1929 (see the solid line). According to the figures, the ζ t shock is not particularly useful for
explaining the contraction phase of the Great Depression. For example, it fails to explain the
fall in the price level. Somewhat surprisingly, it also fails to account for the fall in investment.
Analysis of the model’s impulse response function (not displayed) reveals that investment
rises in response to a positive shock to ζ t . The rise lasts for a number of periods, after which
it eventually falls as a steady state analysis suggests. We found that this initial increase in
investment is partly a function of the high estimated autocorrelation of ζ t . When we replace
the estimated autocorrelation of nearly unity with 0.90, then investment falls immediately
in response to a positive shock to ζ t . We suspect that the explanation for the transient rise
in investment has to do with our entrepreneurial sector. However, this is something that is
still under investigation. For our present purposes, the message is that the ζ t shock is not
an important shock for understanding the contraction phase of the Great Depression.

5.2

Financial Market Shocks

We have two financial market shocks. The first, γ t , measures variations in the rate of
destruction of financial wealth. The second, σ t , measures the riskiness of entrepreneurs.
Figure 7 displays the dynamic response of output, employment, investment, and the price
level to these two shocks.
Consider the shock, γ t . In results not displayed, we found that this shock helps the model
account well for the fluctuations in the value of the stock market. It also has a noticeable effect on the risk premium and, according to row 2 of Figure 7, on investment. Still, according
to the results in Figure 7 this shock plays essentially no role in explaining the fluctuations in
output and employment. We suspect that the small role accorded to this shock by the estimation strategy reflects that a drop in γ t has a tendency to generate counterfactually strong
consumption. This is a consequence of the fact that in our model, when an entrepreneur
39

dies, his net worth is transferred to households, who proceed to consume a large part of it.
Indeed, we suspect that this shock is responsible for the counterfactual jump in consumption
evident in Figure 5. A possible improvement to the model that would allow γ t to play a
greater role is if some fraction of the entrepreneur’s physical stock of capital is destroyed
when the entrepreneur dies.
Turning to σ t , we found that this shock has a substantial impact on the risk premium and
on investment. According to the fourth row of Figure 7, this shock also has a quantitatively
noticeable impact on output and employment. However, the model-simulated movements in
these variables are not well correlated with the corresponding U.S. data. Finally, a diﬃculty
that the σ t shock shares with γ t is that by reducing the flow of resources into investment, it
stimulates consumption.39 Presumably, this is why it did not have a larger role assigned to
it.

5.3

Monetary Shocks

Consider the shock to bank reserve demand, ξ t . According to Figure 6, this variable displays
a trend fall beginning in 1930. In results not displayed here, we found that the primary
eﬀect of this fall is to enable the model to explain the trend rise in the reserves-to-deposit
ratio (see Figure 5). According to the model, this is not a key shock underlying the Great
Depression. The same is true for θt .
Consider now the liquidity preference shock, υ t . Figure 6 shows that this shock rises
rapidly beginning in 1929. After 1933 its growth rate falls, though the shock continues
to rise for the rest of the decade. Figure 8 displays the result of simulating our model in
response to the estimated time-series of υ t shocks alone. For comparison, the dotted lines
display the actual data, reproduced from the solid line in Figure 5.
The key thing to notice in Figure 8 is that the υ t shock accounts for several key features
of the Great Depression. Notice in particular, that it explains part of the loss of value of the
stock market, the fall in the price level, the fall in employment, and part of the fall in output
and investment. It captures part of the rise in the premium and a major part of the fall
in M1. Since this shock appears to be particularly important in our model’s account of the
Great Depression, we now explore the economics of how a rise in υ t initially aﬀects financial
markets, and then how it is transmitted to the rest of the economy.
To understand the chain of events that an innovation in υ t initiates, it is useful to understand how the household reacts to a tightening in its liquidity constraint, (9). Let µt denote
the multiplier on (9). Recall that the household starts the period in possession of the economy’s stock of base money, Mtb , and allocates this between currency, Mt , and deposits, At .
So, µt represents the marginal value to the household of additional beginning-of-time-t base
39

This mechanism has also been emphasized in Romer (1990).

40

money. Let λt denote the multiplier on the household’s asset accumulation equation, (11).
This multiplier represents the marginal value of end-of-time-t base money. The first-order
b
in the Lagrangian representation of the household’s problem
condition associated with Mt+1
implies λt = βµt+1 . (We ignore uncertainty in this discussion.) That is, the shadow value of
end-of-period base money is equal to the discounted shadow of base money at the beginning
of the next period.
Using these multipliers, we can write out the first-order conditions associated with the
household’s currency and deposit decisions:
uM,t + βµt+1 = µt
uDh ,t + (1 + Rat )βµt+1 = µt .

(25)
(26)

Here, uM,t and uDh ,t denote the time-t marginal utility of currency and household deposits,
respectively. In (25) and (26), the left side measures the benefit of the given liquid asset, and
the right side, the cost. In the case of currency, the benefit of an additional unit of currency
is the marginal utility of that currency. There is also a pecuniary benefit, βµt+1 , because
at the end of the time-t, currency held during time-t adds to the household’s beginning of
time-t + 1 holdings of base money. The right side of (25) has µt , the shadow value of a
unit of current-period base. This captures the fact that a marginal unit of currency requires
giving up a unit of monetary base. Expression (26) is the analogous condition, applied
to the household’s deposit decision. The principal substantive diﬀerence between the two
expressions is that the pecuniary benefit associated with deposits is greater, since they pay
interest.
Since the marginal cost of an extra unit of deposits is the same as the marginal cost of
an extra unit of currency, the marginal benefits of the two assets must be the same. Since
deposits have a greater pecuniary payoﬀ, their non-pecuniary payoﬀ is necessarily smaller:
uDh ,t < uM,t .
Now, suppose something happens to raise the shadow value, µt , of current-period base, while
leaving Rat and µt+1 unaﬀected. Then, the total marginal benefit of both assets must rise.
Since the non-pecuniary part of the return to deposits is relatively small, it must be that
uDh ,t rises by a greater percentage than uM,t . Now, our functional-form assumptions imply
uM,t = υ t uL,t θ

It follows that when the shadow value of current-period monetary base rises, then households
allocate more base to currency.
With these considerations in mind, we can proceed to discuss the eﬀects of a jump in
υ t . According to our estimates (see Table 6), the monetary authority kept the monetary
base roughly unchanged in response to a liquidity preference shock. At the same time, a
jump in υ t drives up the marginal utility of deposits and currency (see (27)-(28)). With
the desire for liquidity up, and the total supply unchanged, the shadow value of liquidity,
µt , rises. By the argument in the previous paragraph, this induces households to reduce
Dth /Mt . Since monetary policy keeps the sum of these two variables fixed, this requires
reducing Dth and raising Mt . Figure 9 displays the response of these variables, expressed as a
ratio to their unshocked steady state growth paths, in response to a one-standard-deviation
positive innovation in υ t (for the magnitude of this shock, see Table 6 and the associated
discussion.) Note how currency rises to a peak of about 1 percent above the steady state,
while deposits fall by about 2 percent. In the quest for additional liquidity, households
cut back on consumption and on the acquisition of time deposits. Figure 9 shows how
these variables drop relative to their unshocked steady state growth paths. Time deposits
eventually drop by 2 percent, and consumption eventually drops a little over 1 percent.
The reduced supply of reserves to banks leads to a drop in M1. These eﬀects show up in
interest rates. Figure 9 shows the interbank loan rate rises, at least initially.
Entrepreneurs feel the eﬀects of these developments. The interest rate paid by nonbankrupt entrepreneurs rises, and this, together with the lost income due to the fall in
capital rent in the slowing economy, drives up the bankruptcy rate (these are not shown).
The latter rises to over one percent per quarter above the steady state value of 0.8 percent.
Entrepreneurs cut back on purchases of new capital, and this leads capital producers to
reduce investment. This leads to a fall in the price of capital, which exacerbates the fall
in net worth. This fall further constrains the ability of entrepreneurs to purchase capital,
leading to an additional fall in investment. In eﬀect, the credit market restrictions have
the eﬀect of amplifying the negative output eﬀects associated with the initial reductions in
spending. Output ultimately falls over 1.5 percent in response to the one-standard-deviation
jump in the liquidity preference shock. Investment falls over 4 percent.
Qualitatively, at least, all these eﬀects resemble what actually happened to the economy
after 1929. One exception is the interest rate, which rises initially. However, this eﬀect is
transient, and rates fall very soon after their initial rise. We suspect that this reflects the
fall in money demand as the amount of economic activity declines.

Counterfactual Analysis

We identify a monetary policy rule which, if implemented starting in 1929IV, would have
resulted in a mild recession in the 1930s rather than the Great Depression. The rule feeds
back on the monetary shocks only.40 The policy calls for a temporary increase in money
growth in the periods after the shock. We pursue this type of policy in order to be consistent
with the fact that there was essentially no scope for short-term interest rates to fall after
1932. We illustrate the importance of “backloading” the money response in this way by
comparing it to a policy in which the full money base response is concentrated in the period
of the shock (“frontloading”). This policy would have made the zero-bound restriction on
the interest rate bind.
To describe the policy, it is convenient to reproduce the monetary policy rule in section
3.8:
µ b ¶
X
Mt+1
=
x
(xi,t + 1) ,
log
Mtb
i
where x is the steady state net growth rate in the monetary base. Also, xi,t is the component
of monetary policy that reacts to the ith shock:
xi,t = θ0i ϕi,t + θ1i ϕi,t−1 + θ2i xi,t−1 .
When we backload policy, we set θ0i = 0 and θ1i 6= 0, indicating that the monetary policy
response does not begin until the period after the shock. In addition, we set θ2i > 0, so that
part of the policy response occurs more than one period after the shock. We considered only
those i’s corresponding to the monetary shocks, ξ t , θt , and υ t . The policy we computed is
one of “leaning against the wind.” That is, if, in the absence of a monetary response, an
innovation would lead to a fall in output, then our counterfactual policy calls for an increase
in the base. Otherwise, the policy calls for a decrease.
In the case of shocks, ξ t , to the bank demand for excess reserves, θ1i = −7 and θ2i = 0.85.
With this parameterization, the monetary base falls 0.55 percent in the period after a onestandard-deviation innovation in ξ t . Because θ1i > 0, the monetary base continues to fall in
later periods and it eventually stabilizes at a level 3.7 percent below where it would have
been in the absence of a shock.41 This is a policy of “leaning against the wind” because a rise
40

In some models an appropriately designed feedback rule can exactly neutralize the impact of money
demand shocks on the economy. In our model, this is not the case, even though we consider monetary
base rules that react to individual shocks. This can be seen by studying the equations that characterize
equilibrium in our model (these are listed in the appendix). A given money demand shock and the money
base growth rate appear asymmetrically across more than one equation. As a result, it is not possible to set
the monetary base to exactly extinguish a shock.
41
The contemporaneous response to an innovation of σ in a shock is computed as σ × x × θ1i × 100, where
σ is found in Table 6. The eventual response is σ × x × θ1i × 100/(1 − θ2i ).

43

in ξ t signifies a fall in bank demand for excess reserves, which would lead to an expansion in
output in the absence of a monetary response. The policy response is substantially greater
than what we estimated actually occurred (see Table 6).
In the case of θt , θ1i = −1, and θ2i = 0.85. Thus, the drop in the monetary base in the
period after a one-standard-deviation innovation in θt is 0.08 percent. Eventually, the base
falls by 0.55 percent. In the absence of any monetary policy response, an innovation in θt has
the eﬀect of stimulating output in our model.42 The response of the counterfactual policy
to θt is somewhat weaker than what we estimated to have occurred. Finally, in the case of
υ t , θ1i = 2, and θ2i = 0.6. As a result, the monetary base rises by 0.29 percent in the period
after a one-standard-deviation innovation in υ t . Eventually, the monetary base rises by 0.72
percent in response to such a shock.
The dotted line in Figure 10 displays the dynamic behavior of the variables in our model,
in response to all the estimated shocks and the counterfactual policy rule for the period
1929-1939. The solid line indicates the behavior of the same variables under the estimated
monetary policy rule and shocks. We refer to this as the “baseline simulation.” With one
caveat, it corresponds to the dotted line in Figure 5. The caveat reflects our estimation
strategy, which focusses on model means at the calibration stage, but abstracts from these
at the stage where we estimate the parameters of the stochastic processes.43 One diﬀerence
between the dotted line in Figure 5 and the baseline simulation in Figure 10 (solid line)
that deserves emphasis is that the short-term interest rate (the “policy rate”) is nearly 4
percentage points higher in Figure 10 than in Figure 5. Because of this, the interest rate
in our model has a longer way to fall before hitting zero than the interest rate in the U.S.
economy in the 1930s did. To make sure that we do not give ourselves any flexibility that
policymakers in the 1930s did not have, we only considered counterfactual policies in which
the interest rate never falls below the lowest value taken on by the interest rate in the baseline
simulation.
Note first the dynamic behavior of real output. The magnitude of the contraction in the
period 1929-1933 is cut substantially under the counterfactual policy (see Table 8). In the
baseline simulation output falls by 26 percent (i.e., 4 times the 6.4 percent annual rate),
while it falls only 6 percent under the counterfactual policy rule. Over the whole decade,
42

To see why, note from (8) that since the currency-to-household-deposit ratio exceeds unity, one of the
eﬀects of an increase in θt is to raise the marginal utility of consumption. See Table 5 for the currency-tohousehold deposit ratio. (Note that the currency-to-deposit ratio is well below unity.) Given our parameterization, this is the dominant eﬀect of an increase in θt , and this is why a positive innovation in this shock
stimulates output.
43
Recall that the estimation strategy chooses parameter values of the stochastic processes in order to make
the actual and model data in Figure 4 as close as possible. We abstract from the model’s mean implications
by adjusting the model data by a constant to ensure that model and empirical sample averages coincide.
The variables in Figure 5 are just the variables in Figure 4, transformed. The baseline simulation reported
in Figure 10 corresponds to the dotted line in Figure 5, except that no constant adjustments were made.

44

output rises 8 percent under the counterfactual rule, versus the 10 percent fall recorded in
the baseline. Output growth over the entire decade of the 1930s is 0.8 percent per year, a
little over one-half its trend value of 1.5 percent. Initially, the interest rate falls relative to
the baseline, but in the later part of the 1930s, it is higher than the baseline.
Turning to the other variables in the counterfactual simulation, consider first the monetary base. The rise in this variable over the full decade is 12 percent per year. The rise in the
price level is roughly 3.2 percent per year. The counterfactual policy has a very substantial
eﬀect on asset values, driving up the real value of net worth by as much as 40 percent more
after 1932. The impact on asset values before this is smaller, and perhaps this is the reason
that the counterfactual policy does not have a large impact on investment until later. The
counterfactual policy introduces some negatively correlated volatility in consumption and
investment, which appears to cancel in output. We do not, as yet, understand the reason
for this volatility.
It is interesting that the counterfactual policy has such a substantial stimulative impact
on output without driving the interest rate down unduly. The reason for this is that the
monetary policy response to shocks occurs primarily in the periods after the shock. As a
result, the policy injects a substantial anticipated inflation eﬀect into the interest rate. To
illustrate this, we considered a monetary policy in which θ0i is replaced with θ0i = θ1i /(1 −
θ2i ) and θ1i , θ2i are both set to zero. With this policy the response of money to a shock
is completely frontloaded. This reduces by a substantial amount the magnitude of the
anticipated inflation eﬀect on the interest rate. In addition, because the monetary response
is completely unanticipated when it occurs, it has a relatively large impact on real allocations.
To make the policy comparable to our counterfactual, we scaled the money responses to a
shock by 0.69 so that the growth rate of output is 0.8 percent per year over the 1930s, as in
the counterfactual policy in Table 8.44 Not surprisingly, with this alternative counterfactual,
the rise in the price level is much less, only 0.8 percent per year in the 1930s, versus 3.2
percent per year in the counterfactual (see Table 8 for the latter). In addition, M1 rises by
less as well. The other variables in Table 8 are roughly unchanged. However, the interest rate
response, displayed in Figure 11, is quite diﬀerent. Under the alternative counterfactual, the
interest rate drops substantially below the baseline simulation results. Such a large reduction
in the interest rate could not have been implemented in the 1930s because it would have
violated the zero lower bound constraint.
It is worth emphasizing that if the policy reaction function were stronger than it is in the
counterfactual, then the output response would have been stronger as well. However, this
would have come at the cost of substantially higher inflation. For example, when we set θ1i
to 7, rather than its value of 2 in the counterfactual, we found that average output growth
44

Thus, we replaced θ0i with θ0i = 0.69 × θ1i /(1 − θ2i ).

45

in the 1930s is close to trend, 1.6 percent. However, this comes at the cost of substantially
higher inflation. The annual inflation over the period 1929-1939 is 7.3 percent, and over the
period 1933-1939 it is 12.5 percent.
It is worth noting that the eﬀectiveness of monetary policy in reducing the severity of
the Great Depression depends very much on the state-contingent nature of the policy. To
establish this, we considered a second alternative counterfactual experiment in which we
instead adopted a completely deterministic monetary policy in 1929IV. In this policy, the
money growth rate is roughly equal to the realized money growth in our counterfactual
experiment. The impact on real variables of this policy was minor. This reflects that in the
long run, monetary policy is roughly neutral in our model. Unexpected monetary policy,
whether driven by exogenous random shocks or disturbances to the economy’s fundamentals,
do have a substantial eﬀect. To document this, we simulated a version of our model in which
the only shock driving the monetary base is an iid monetary policy shock. We picked the
sequence of shocks to force the monetary base to grow as in our counterfactual experiment.
We found that the impact on output and employment of this policy was roughly comparable
to what we obtained in the counterfactual experiment.
We conclude this section by briefly indicating in what sense we confirm the hypothesis
of Friedman and Schwartz (1963). Note that in our conterfactual experiment there is considerable growth in M1. In fact, we found that when monetary policy is designed to simply
prevent the decline in M1, this is not enough to substantially modify the course of the Great
Depression in our model. In this sense we do not confirm Friedman and Schwartz, who argue
that the 1930s would have been substantially improved if only the Fed had not permitted the
drop in M1. We do confirm Friedman and Schwartz, however, in the sense that we identify a
monetary policy that would have substantially reduced the severity of the Great Depression.

7

Conclusion

We have constructed a model of the U.S. economy in the 1920s and 1930s. The model
deserves to be taken seriously as a laboratory for monetary policy because it reproduces
key features of the data. According to the model, a liquidity preference shock played an
important role in the contraction phase of the Great Depression. Increased market power
of workers accounts for the persistently low level of employment and high real wages during
the expansion phase of the Great Depression. The model indicates that a monetary policy
which reacts to the innovations in the liquidity preference shock and other monetary shocks
would have substantially reduced the magnitude of the Great Depression. This is consistent
with the Friedman-Schwartz hypothesis.
The analysis of this paper suggests several avenues for future research. First, it would
46

be of interest to see whether the liquidity preference shock plays an important role in other
times and places, such as the postwar U.S., Japanese or Euro-area economies. In addition,
it would be of interest to explore, at a more foundational level, the nature and sources of
our liquidity preference shock. Second, our model incorporates various features: a banking
sector, financing frictions, etc. Isolating the contribution of each of these features to the
transmission of shocks is beyond the scope of this paper. However, doing so would provide
crucial information for future model development. Third, in our analysis we have identified
a particular feedback rule that relates the monetary base to the exogenous shocks, which
would have mitigated the severity of the Great Depression. Discussions about monetary
policy often focus on rules that relate variables such as the interest rate or the monetary
base to endogenous variables such as inflation and the output gap. We conjecture that there
are monetary policy rules like this that would, in practice, work like the one that we study,
and it would be of interest to explore this further. Fourth, we have based our analysis on
a linear approximation to the equilibrium conditions of the model. Given the relatively
large size of the shocks during the Great Depression, it would be of interest to explore the
robustness of the results to higher order approximations. Fifth, it would be of interest to
explore optimal monetary policy in our model. Presumably, this requires a solution method
which can accommodate an occasionally binding zero lower bound constraint on the interest
rate. We suspect that such rules would involve accommodating money demand shocks, as
our counterfactual rule does.

Appendix: Model Solution

This appendix reports the details of how we solved our model. The solution strategy involves
linearization about the model’s nonstochastic steady state. After a brief overview, we discuss
the computation of the steady state. We then present the linearized equations of the model.
The model solution was described in section 3.9. It involves a set of core endogenous variables,

To solve for the 23 variables in z̃t , we linearize 23 equations of our model. We express
these in matrix form as follows:
Et [α0 z̃t+1 + α1 z̃t + α2 z̃t−1 + β 0 Ψt+1 + β 1 Ψt ] = 0.

(30)

We seek a solution of the form, (19), which ensures that (30) is satisfied for all possible z̃t−1
and Ψt , and which is covariance stationary. This requires an A and B that satisfy:
α0 A2 + α1 A + α2 I = 0
α0 (AB + Bρ) + α1 B + β 0 ρ + β 1 = 0.
We found that there is a unique A with eigenvalues inside the unit circle that satisfies the
first equation. Conditional on this value of A, the second set of equations is linear in B.
To complete our discussion of the solution method requires explaining how α0 , α1 , α2 ,
β 0 , and β 1 were computed. This requires a discussion of the steady state of the model and
of the actual equations in (30).

A.1

Model Steady State

This section describes our strategy for computing the steady state for our model. In many
models, solving for the steady state is straightforward, because one can find a recursive
ordering among the equations. We were not able to do so for our model, and so the computation of the steady state represents a considerable challenge. We developed two strategies.
In the first one we set some of the endogenous variables of the model to values that seem
reasonable based on empirical evidence, making these variables exogenous in the steady state
calculations. We moved an equal number of the model’s exogenous variables into the list
of variables that were endogenous in the steady state calculations. This approach allowed
us to reduce the problem of computing the steady state to the relatively manageable one
of solving a single equation in a single unknown. This approach works well for solving our
baseline model. However, it is impractical when we considered a counterfactual experiment
in which it was desired to change the value of one (and only one) exogenous variable.45 A
second strategy was developed for this. We now describe the two strategies. Our description
refers to the steady state formulas which are derived subsequently.
45

In the main text, we discuss the results of this experiment, where we change the value of the money
growth rate, µ.

For the first strategy, the set of exogenously set variables are:
τ l , β, F (ω̄), µ, x, µz , λf , λw , α, ψ k , ψ l , δ, υ,

λz , ψ L , erz , ev , xb , ξ, hK b , y, g, σ.
The equations available for solving for these unknowns are summarized below. The first
three variables are trivial functions of the structural parameters, and from here on we treat
them as known. In addition, Ra can be solved using equation (51) below. There remain 22
unknowns. Below, we have 22 equations that can be used to solve for them.
The algorithm involves finding a value of R that solves (40). To evaluate (40) requires
first solving for the other ‘endogenous’ variables. For a given R, we proceed as follows. Solve
for her using (46). Solve for Rk using (36); solve for ω̄ using (37); solve for σ using the given
values of F (ω̄) and ω̄, as well as the condition, Eω = 1; solve for k and n using (38) and
(39); solve for i using (35); solve for w using (31); solve for l using (33); solve for c using
(55); solve (56) and (54) for g and y; solve for uzc using (52); solve for mb and λz using (49)
and (50); solve (53) for ψL ; solve for erz using (48); solve ξ from (47); solve ev from (43);
solve xb from (42); hK b from (41). Vary R until (40) is satisfied. In these calculations, all
variables must be positive, and:
0 ≤ m ≤ 1 + x, 0 ≤ ξ ≤ 1, λz > 0, k > n > 0.
Our second strategy solves the steady state when the ‘exogenous variables’ are the economically exogenous ones, and the ‘endogenous variables’ are the economically endogenous
ones. In particular, consider the situation in which the exogenous variables are:
τ l , β, µ, x, µz , λf , λw , α, ψ k , ψ l , δ, υ, xb , ξ, σ,
τ k , γ, τ , σ L , ζ, σ q , θ, υ, we , ν l , η g , ψ L .
and the variables to be solved for are:
q, π, Re , Ra , her , rk , Rk , ω̄, F (ω̄), k, n, i, w, l, c, uzc ,
mb , R, λz , erz , ev , hK b , y, g, ν k , m.
We solve for the 26 variables above as follows. The first three are solved in the same way
as before. The remainder are solved by solving three equations, (40), (42), and (46), in the
50

three unknowns, rk , ν k , and R. Ideally, we start in a neighborhood of the solution obtained
in the previous calculations. Fix a set of values for rk , ν k , and R. The basic sequence of
calculations is the same as above. Solve for Rk using (36), and then ω̄, F (ω̄) using (37) and
the value of σ. Then, solve for k, n, and i using (38), (39), and (35), in that order. Next, we
obtain w from (31) and l from (33). The resource constraint, (55), can be used to obtain c;
and (56) and (54) can be used to compute y, g. Then, obtain λz and uzc from (52) and (53).
Solve (49), (50) and (51) for Ra , m, and mb . This can be made into a one-dimensional search
in m. In particular, for a given m, solve for Ra from (51) and for mb from (49). Vary m
until (50) is satisfied. In this search, the lower bound on m is zero, while the upper bound is
θ(1 + x), and is dictated by Ra ≥ 0. Compute her , hK b , eν , and erz , using (41), (43), (47), and
(48). We can now evaluate (40), (42), and (46). Vary rk , ν k , and R until these equations
are satisfied.
The equations that rk , ν k and R solve are not well behaved. They are not well defined for
all possible values of rk , ν k and R. Typically, this happens because there is no m that satisfies
(50). We found that if the equations are defined for a particular set of values of rk , ν k , and R,
then they are not defined for what seems like a tiny perturbation. Equations of this type are
hard to solve with standard Gauss-Newton algorithm, unless one has an extremely good idea
of the exact solution. To find such a solution, we applied a random search method. We made
a guess of the true solution, and then constructed an interval about that solution. We drew
randomly from that interval, and recorded the parameter constellation which produced the
outcome closest to zero for the equations of interest. After the algorithm ran for 5 minutes
or so, it had found a solution close enough that a Gauss-Newton method could take over
and productively drive into the exact solution for rk , ν k , and R.
We now describe the equations of the steady state.

Capital Producers

The first-order necessary condition for maximization of It for the capital producers is

Here, F1t and F2t denote the derivatives of the adjustment cost function with respect to
its first and second arguments. Multiplying the first-order condition by zt /Pt we obtain, in
steady state:

where the hazard rate, h, is defined as follows:
F 0 (ω)
.
h(ω) =
1 − F (ω)
This equation has two additional parameters, the two parameters of the lognormal distribution, F. These two parameters, however, are pinned down by the assumption Eω = 1 and
the fact that we specify F (ω̄) exogenously. With these conditions, (37) forms a basis for
computing ω̄. Note here that when µ = 0, (37) reduces to Rk = Re . Then, combining (36)
with the first-order condition for time deposits, we end up with the conclusion that rk is
determined as it is in the neoclassical growth model.
From the single first-order condition for k in the costly-state-verification problem, and
conditional on F (ω̄) and ω̄, we may solve for k, thus obtaining:46

Linearizing the Model Economy

This section describes the 23 equations that characterize the equilibrium for our model
economy. In each case, we present the log-linear expansion of the equation about the nonstochastic steady state. With a few exceptions, we also present the non-linear representation
of the equation.

Following Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2003), we suppose that F (It , It−1 ) has the
following form:
F (It , It−1 ) = [1 − S(It /It−1 )] It ,
where S 00 denotes the second derivative of S, evaluated at the steady state value of It /It−1 .
In addition, we suppose that S = S 0 = 0 in steady state. Recalling that the the first-order
necessary condition for maximization of It for the capital producers can be written:

Entrepreneurs

There are five equations pertaining to entrepreneurs. The first is the optimality condition
associated with the entrepreneur’s capital utilization decision:
rtk − a0 (ut ) = 0.
After linearization, this reduces to:
Er̂tk − σ a ût = 0,
56

(62)

where σ a = a00 /a0 and a00 , a0 denote the second and first derivatives of a, respectively, evaluated in steady state.
Of the other four equations corresponding to the entrepreneurial sector, two characterize
the loan contracts received from banks. The third defines the law of motion of entrepreneurial
net worth. The fourth defines the rate of return on capital earned by entrepreneurs.
The necessary condition associated with optimality of the loan contract received by entrepreneurs from banks is:

where Ft denotes the cumulative distribution function for ω t+1 . Here, a prime indicates

It is of interest to note that monetary policy cannot exactly neutralize the ξ̂ t shock.
From (66), we see that the impact of x̂t on êv,t is determined by nx . So, according to (67),
neutralizing the ξ̂ t shock requires setting the component in x̂t pertaining to ξ̂ t , x̂ξ̂t ,t as follows:

Evidently, the previous two equations cannot both be satisfied at the same time.

Households

We now turn to the equations associated with the household sector. It is useful to define uc,t
as the derivative of the present discounted value of utility with respect to Ct :
Et {uc,t − u0 (Ct − bCt−1 ) + bβu0 (Ct+1 − bCt )} = 0.
Using the definition, uzc,t = zt uc,t , and our functional form assumption, this reduces to:

Monetary Policy

The monetary base evolves as follows:
b
Mt+1
= Mtb (1 + xt ),

where xt is the net growth rate of the monetary base. The law of motion of the scaled
monetary base, mbt = Mtb /(Pt zt ), is:
b
Mt+1
Pt zt Mtb
=
(1 + xt ),
Pt+1 zt+1
Pt+1 zt+1 Pt zt

or
mbt+1 =

mbt (1 + xt ).

Linearizing this expression,

Monetary policy has the following representation:
x̂t =

(78)

i=1

where the xit ’s are functions of the underlying shocks, as discussed in section 3.7.

Aggregate Restrictions

Here we have ignored additional terms in the aggregate resource constraint which appear
when labor and capital are misallocated across the intermediate goods firms. For a justification, see the argument in Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2003), which builds on the
important work of Yun (1996). Scaling the goods constraint by zt :

Notes on Table 4: Total assets consists of reserves, plus working-capital loans, plus loans to entrepreneurs. The first
line shows the ratio of these to annual goods output. With the exception of the bottom row of numbers, remaining
entries in the table are expressed as a fraction of bank reserves plus working capital loans. The bottom row of numbers
is expressed as a fraction of total assets.
Data for the period 1995-2001: We define working-capital loans as total demand deposits minus total reserves.
This number is the same order of magnitude as the sum of short-term bank loans with maturity 24 months or less
(taken from the Board of Governors’ “Banking and Monetary Statistics”, 1943) and commerical paper (Table L101
in Board of Governors’ Flow of Funds Accounts). Long-term entrepreneurial loans are defined as the total liabilities
of the nonfinancial business sector (nonfarm nonfinancial corporate business, plus nonfarm noncorporate business,
plus farm business) net of municipal securities, trade payables, taxes payables, “miscellaneous liabilites,” and the
working-capital loans. Source: With exception of required and excess reserves, the source is the Federal Reserve’s
Flow of Funds data. Required and excess reserves are obtained from Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
Data for the period 1921-1929: We define working-capital loans as total demand deposits minus total reserves
for all banks. Entrepreneurial loans are constructed on the basis of all bank loans minus working capital loans plus
outstanding bonds issued by all industries. Source: Banking and Monetary Statistics, Board of Governors, September
1943, and NBER historical database, available at www.nber.org.

Notes to Table 5:
Data for 1921-1929: (1) “Federal funds rate” is the average rate on bankers’ acceptances. (2) Interest rate on
working-capital loans is the commerical paper rate. (3) Rate on loans to entrepreneurs is the average of returns on
Aaa and Baa corporate bonds. (4) Rate on time deposits is available only from 1933 onwards. Reported data in
Board of Governors (1943) only cite the administrative rate (maximum rate) set by the Fed. The average of this
rate was 2.7% over the period 1933-41. (5) There are no data available on the rate paid on demand deposits (to our
knowledge).
Data for 1964-2002: (1) The federal funds rate covers the period 1964III-2002III. Source: Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve. (2) The rate on demand deposits is the “Money Zero Maturity Own Rate” (1964III-2002III).
Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis. (3) The rate on loans to entrepreneurs is the average between Aaa
and Baa corporate bonds (1964III-2002III). Source: Board of Governors. (4) The rate on time deposit is the rate on
3-month CDs (1964III-2002III). Source: Board of Governors. (5) The rate of return on capital is the rate of profit on
stockholders’ equity for the manufacturing sector (1980I-2001IV). Source: Bureau of the Census (2002, Table I). (6)
The rate on working-capital loans is the rate on commercial paper (dealer-placed unsecured short-term negotiable
promissory notes issued by companies with Aa bond ratings and sold to investors), averaged over 1971I-2002III.
