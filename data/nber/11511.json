    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper reviews five striking facts about inequality across countries. As Kuznets (1955) famously\nfirst documented, inequality first rises and then falls with income. More unequal societies are much\nless likely to have democracies or governments that respect property rights. Unequal societies have\nless redistribution, and we have little idea whether this relationship is caused by redistribution\nreducing inequality or inequality reducing redistribution. Inequality and ethnic heterogeneity are\nhighly correlated, either because of differences in educational heritages across ethnicities or because\nethnic heterogeneity reduces redistribution. Finally, there is much more inequality and less\nredistribution in the U.S. than in most other developed nations.\n\n",
