ABSTRACT
There have been a vast number of social security reforms aimed at increasing employment at
older ages over the last two decades in the Netherlands. These reforms mainly lead to more
stringent eligibility criteria for, and reduced generosity of, social security programs. Our
empirical evidence suggests that these reforms are likely to have contributed to individuals
working longer, but it is difficult to pinpoint which reforms have been most effective.
Furthermore, we show that the recent increase in the state pension eligibility age is likely to
further increase employment at older ages.

Abstract
There have been a vast number of social security reforms aimed at increasing employment at
older ages over the last two decades in the Netherlands. These reforms mainly lead to more
stringent eligibility criteria for, and reduced generosity of, social security programs. Our
empirical evidence suggests that these reforms are likely to have contributed to individuals
working longer, but it is difficult to pinpoint which reforms have been most effective.
Furthermore, we show that the recent increase in the state pension eligibility age is likely to
further increase employment at older ages.

1. Introduction
The rising labor force participation at older ages since the mid-nineteen-nineties in the
Netherlands has been attributed to, among other factors, older workers’ improved health,
increased levels of education and better matched skills with labor demand, changes in social
security programs 1 such as disability insurance, unemployment insurance and early
retirement schemes (Kalwij, Kapteyn, & de Vos, 2017). Kapteyn and de Vos (1999) have

1

Social security programs (SSPs) encompass state pension (SP), disability insurance (DI), unemployment

insurance (UI), social assistance (SA) and other public transfer programs available at older ages, such as tax
exemptions for early retirement (ER) pensions until 2006 and private pensions from the state pension age (SPA)
onwards.

investigated the role of financial incentives induced by early retirement schemes in the
decline in labor force participation during the 1980s and early 1990s in the Netherlands. This
chapter expands on this study by examining the eligibility criteria and the generosity of the
different social security programs from 1980 until 2016, and the changes during this period in
the implicit tax rates on working longer at older ages induced by these programs. In addition,
our chapter examines the importance of the state pension age (SPA) for working longer.
The outline of this chapter is as follows. Section 2 discusses institutional changes in social
security over the last decades. Section 3 presents for each of the most pertinent social security
programs (SSPs) the implicit tax rates on working longer conditional on being eligible for it.
Next, Section 4 presents employment and SSPs’ participation rates. Graphical evidence is
provided using a cohort perspective on how the labor force participation at older ages might
have been affected by the introduction and reforms of SSPs. In addition, empirical evidence
is presented on the effect of recent changes in the statutory state pension age (SPA) on
working longer. Section 6 concludes.

2. Description of Institutional Changes
Table 1 provides an overview of the most important reforms over the last decades of the State
Pension (SP), Unemployment Insurance (UI), Disability Insurance (DI), Early Retirement
(ER), and Private/Occupational Pension (PP) schemes.
UI, DI and ER are available for workers before the State Pension age. After the State Pension
age (SPA), individuals can no longer receive benefits from these schemes and receive a flat
rate public pension benefit. Hence, after the SPA, all individuals are covered by the SP
scheme. The PP schemes often have two regimes: providing early retirement pensions before
the SPA and providing private pensions after the SPA. The pensions to be received may vary,
2

dependent on the PP/ER schemes in which the worker is enrolled. These PP/ER schemes can
be occupation, firm or sector specific.
State Pension (SP)
The flat rate State Pension (SP) is financed by pay as you go social insurance contributions.
By and large, since 1974, the flat rate state pension is indexed by the after tax minimum
wage. Revisions have included the introduction of an independent pension entitlement for
married women in 1985 2, and an entitlement to supplementary State Pension benefits for
persons with a spouse younger than 65 (1985; revised 1994; abolished in 2015). As from
2013, the State Pension age, which had been 65 from the start, is increasing gradually. The
State Pension age will reach 67 in 2021. After 2021, it will increase further following the
average increase in life expectancy.
Early retirement (ER)
ER was introduced in most sectors of the economy during the 1970s. In most cases it entailed
an offer too good to refuse at least until the end of the 1990s. The ER benefit usually
amounted to 80% of previous earnings without actuarial adjustment for later take-up. It lasted
until the State Pension age, when State Pension and occupational/private pensions kicked in.
The prospect of exploding costs once the large baby boom cohorts started to reach the ER age
led to reforms by the end of the 1990s. In most cases a reduction of the ER benefit was
combined with the introduction of more or less actuarially fair adjustments for the age at
which one would take early retirement. As a result, the employee could still opt for retiring
early, but with a reduced pension. By 2006, the government terminated the tax exemption for
ER contributions that would enable a retirement age lower than 65. Only systems offering a

3

replacement rate of at most 70% of previous earnings at the State Pension age of 65, and
actuarially fair reductions for early claiming could still collect tax exempt contributions.
Occupational/private pensions (PP)
In addition to the State Pension, most employees accumulate fully funded occupational
pension rights and supplement their State Pension to (ideally) 70% of previous earnings.
Participation in PP schemes is mostly mandatory. Pension funds, operating by sector, and, in
a number of cases, by firm, invest the pension contributions, which are usually shared by the
employer and employee. Since the early 2000s, pension funds have started to reduce the
generosity of occupational pensions by shifting from benefits based on final earnings to
benefits based on average earnings. Moreover, in general the indexation of benefits, which
used to be based on the wage index, has become less generous following successive stock
market downturns, affecting the investment returns of pension funds. Some pension funds
had to reduce the pension benefits in nominal terms (Kalwij, Alessie, Gardner & Ali, 2018).
Disability Insurance (DI)
Introduced in 1967, the Dutch Disability Insurance aimed to insure employees against loss of
earnings as a result of long-term illness or incapacity. If after one year of illness the employee
could not resume work, he/she would be entitled to an earnings-related DI benefit that could
last until the State Pension age.
Starting in the 1970s, the number of individuals on DI showed a steady increase until the
1990s, much more than expected when the DI legislation was introduced and much more than
could be expected given the average health status of the population. In fact, with
unemployment rising fast in the mid-1970s, the route to DI was generally used by employers
and employees as an alternative to unemployment. As a result, expenditures on DI soared.
Since the start of the 1980s government policy has sought to reverse this trend by various

4

reforms to limit access to DI, increase outflow out of DI and by lowering the average DI
benefit. In 1985, the replacement rate of DI was lowered from 80% to 70%. In 1987, access
to the full DI was limited for partially disabled unemployed new entrants. In the early 1990s
the duration of the full DI benefit was limited for new entrants younger than 50, stricter
disability criteria were introduced for entry into DI and younger DI recipients were to be
retested. Still, mainly because most employees took out private insurance to compensate for
the shorter duration, DI remained an attractive option.
Next to limiting the access and the generosity of the benefit, policies were also introduced to
shift the costs to firms with high numbers of employees exiting to DI. First, the costs of
sickness benefits were charged directly to the employer for two to six weeks (1994), and later
on for a full year preceding the exit to DI, and, second, in 1998, for large firms experience
rating was introduced. All these reforms did not succeed in substantially reducing the
numbers of DI recipients, however. As a result, as from 2002, employers and employees were
made jointly responsible for taking sufficient action for reintegration into the workforce
during the year of sickness preceding exit to DI. Moreover, this sickness period could be
extended if insufficient reintegration measures had been taken. As of 2004, exit to DI only
happened after two years of sickness, during which time the employer paid sickness benefits.
As of 2006, a new DI law made a strict distinction between fully and permanently disabled
and partially or temporarily disabled workers. The former group was to receive a generous
75% of their previous earnings until the State Pension age. The latter group would receive a
less generous benefit depending on previous earnings, the number of weeks worked before,
and the current earnings (if any) and the percentage of previous earnings that the employee
was deemed to be capable of earning. Furthermore, once again a retest operation was set up
for existing DI beneficiaries younger than 50.

5

Unemployment Insurance (UI)
For workers approaching 60 who were not entitled to ER and who could not plausibly retire
via DI, Unemployment Insurance (UI) offered a third pathway out of the labor force before
the State Pension age. In most cases, it offered a replacement rate of 70%, and furthermore,
no obligation existed to search for employment after the age of 57.5. As of 2004, persons
aged 57.5 or older receiving UI are no longer exempt from the requirement to seek work. In
other words, they are no longer ‘automatically’ receiving UI until the State Pension age but
have to try to find work and accept a job offer. Moreover, as of October 1, 2006, the
maximum duration of UI is 38 months. After that period all that is left is a means tested
entitlement to Social Assistance (SA) with a benefit equal to the after tax minimum wage.

3. Stylized implicit tax rates
For workers eligible for one or more retirement pathways, some of the reforms discussed in
the previous section heavily affect the financial incentives to retire. Other reforms only affect
eligibility, whilst, given eligibility, financial incentives are hardly affected. One convenient
incentive measure that adequately summarizes the monetary effect of retiring now, compared
to postponing it one more year is the implicit tax rate on work, defined as the difference
between the discounted future benefits when retiring now or one year later, divided by the
yearly earnings. 3 A positive implicit tax rate is an incentive to retire now and a negative
implicit tax rate is an incentive to postpone retirement.
Figures 1 through 4 present stylized implicit tax rates for average-waged workers eligible for
respectively DI, UI, ER/PP and SP, for selected years between 1980 and 2015. All tax rates
are conditional on eligibility. As mentioned above, various reforms have been attempted to
limit the number of workers eligible for DI, of which the most recent appears to have been
the most successful. Figure 1 shows that for those eligible, the incentives have not changed
very much between 1980 and 2006. With an implicit tax rate on continued work of 80 to
90%, the financial incentive to retire via the DI channel remains strong. In other words, once
eligible, the implicit tax rate suggests that retiring via the DI pathway is a financially
attractive proposition.
From figure 2 we can infer that from 1987 to 2004, the implicit tax rate on postponing
retirement via the UI pathway was also positive, at least for persons aged 58 and over.
However, the tax rates are clearly lower than for the DI pathway.

3

Notably, the stylized implicit tax rates presented in this paper divide the difference between future discounted
after tax benefits (net Social Security Wealth) when retiring now and one year later by annual after tax earnings.
The pay-roll taxes on earnings incurred when retiring one year later are not deducted from the future benefits.

9

Figure 3 suggests that for workers eligible for Early Retirement at age 60, until recently,
postponing retirement from age 59 until age 60 would have been a very smart decision from a
financial standpoint, because the potential retiree would lose all entitlements to Early
Retirement benefits if he or she would retire earlier. On the other hand, postponing retirement
after age 60 was not very attractive, because there used to be hardly any actuarial
compensation for retiring later than the earliest possible retirement age. Only recently, an
actuarially fair compensation is being offered for postponing retirement. As a result, this no
longer has a negative impact on social security wealth (SSW). In addition, the negative tax
rate on postponing retirement from age 59 to age 60 has as well disappeared since eligibility
for early retirement no longer depends on being employed. Notably, while some large
pension funds offered Early Retirement as of age 60, others had an ERA of 61 or 62, and
Figure 3 would shift accordingly.
Figure 4 shows that for persons who are only eligible for the State Pension, SSW is not
affected by the retirement date. These workers would receive the same State Pension starting
from the statutory State Pension age, no matter at which age they would choose to retire.
It is clear that these incentives differ considerably depending on the pathways a potential
retiree is eligible for. Unfortunately, data that allow us to obtain a reliable estimate of the
effects of these incentives at the individual level, taking account of the possible eligibility for
various pathways, are not available. For the DI pathway, the problem is that eligibility can
only be inferred for persons taking up DI. However, not taking up DI does not necessarily
imply not being eligible. For many retirees, the ER/SP pathway would be financially more
attractive, and by taking this pathway, they would also avoid the possible stigma associated
with retiring via DI. In addition, despite the fact that there is a positive tax on working
associated with postponing retirement via DI, the net replacement rate is still below 100%.

10

The incentives associated with the ER/SP pathway depend on the specific program (pension
fund) in which the potential retiree is enrolled. This determines the Early Retirement age, the
replacement rate, and the actuarial adjustment (if any), and/or the date at which actuarial
adjustment was introduced. The exact conditions also depend on the possible membership of
other pension funds in earlier years, as well as on previous earnings.

years at the ages under 58 and to six years from age 58 onwards is fully insured away. That is, effectively DI recipients
receive a 75% replacement of their income until SPA.

4. Labor force participation
The fall in men’s employment rates at older ages from the mid-nineteen seventies until the
mid-nineteen-nineties in the Netherlands and the rise in employment rates thereafter (see
Figure 5) have, in part, been attributed to SSP reforms (Kalwij, Kapteyn, & de Vos, 2017;
and reference therein).
Figure 6 shows men’s unemployment rates, including individuals who receive unemployment
insurance benefits and social assistance, from 1975 onwards. Figures 7-8 show men’s
participation in DI and ER programs from 1975 onwards. DI participation decreased during
the nineteen-eighties, possibly due to better health of older workers and increasing
participation in early retirement schemes (Figure 7), and perhaps due to some minor DI
reforms such as a reduction in the replacement rate from 80% to 70% (Table 1). Until the
mid-nineteen nineties ER participation increased (Figure 7), most likely due to the implicit

13

taxes on continuing work, once eligible (Figure 3). In addition, the sharp rise in ER
participation during the first half of the nineteen nineties may also be related to more
stringent eligibility criteria for DI and UI (Table 1). Together with rising unemployment
rates, employment rates continued to decrease until the mid-nineteen-nineties.
Since the mid-nineteen-nineties there have been a vast number of SSP reforms aimed at
individuals working longer, which made it more difficult or less attractive for individuals to
go on DI or UI, or retire early (Table 1). Figures 5-8 suggest that these reforms have been
effective but it is difficult to pinpoint which reforms have been most effective.

4.1 A cohort perspective
Different cohorts have faced different retirement incentives through the various pathways
over their lifetimes. This may have resulted in different age profiles of employment rates
across cohorts. Indeed, Figure 9 shows this for the employment rates for men aged 55 to 69
for the cohorts born in 1910, 1915, 1940, 1945, 1950 and 1955. The three generations
considered here were or are facing different social security programs over their life course
(Table 1). The old (1910 & 1915 cohorts) faced less generous social security provisions,
especially in the years when most SSPs where not yet in place; the young (1950 & 1955
cohorts) face stricter eligibility rules and less generous benefits than the cohorts in between
(the 1940 & 1945 cohorts). The employment rates in the figure mirror these lifetime
differences in SSPs, compared to the young and old generation, the in-between generations
who enjoyed a relatively more generous or accessible SSPs over their life course have the
lowest employment rates at older ages. If we look at 60 years-old individuals, we see that in
1975, before the introduction of ER, their participation rate was 70%, whilst in 2000 and
2005 their participation rate was only 40%. In 2010 and 2015, the participation rate of 60
years-old individuals was back to 70%. The participation rates for 60 to 63 years old
individuals show a similar trajectory. These numbers suggest that the eligibility and
generosity of SSPs are important for the decision whether or not to remain employed at older
ages.
Figure 10 shows participation rates in the different SSPs for three groups of cohorts. Due to
low numbers of observations, cohort years needed to be aggregated. We followed the same
approach as above, and only present it for selected cohort-groups that we a priori believe to
have faced rather different SSPs over their life courses (in terms of eligibility and generosity).
The generation of ’40-’44, shows higher rates of ER than the old and young generations (born
17

before 1924 or between 1950 and 1954, respectively). This is the generation that faced
generous ER incentives at the ages that mattered. Concerning DI participation, we see a
higher DI rate for the older generations. This can be a combination of better health and
stricter DI eligibility rules for the younger compared to the older generations. Concerning
generational differences in unemployment at older ages, Figure 10 shows that the
unemployment rate is higher for the generation of ’50-’54 than for the other generations.

4.2. The effect of an increase in the State Pension Age (SPA) on employment
In the Netherlands, employment contracts are terminated by law when workers reach SPA
and state pensions are automatically received. This does not prevent employees and
employers to enter into a new employment contract, but it does mean that employment can be
terminated without the need of severance pay. It may also be interpreted as a signal that this
is the right age to stop working. Thus, SPA may be a barrier for working longer. To obtain
insights into this we exploit recent increases in SPA and examine the impact of this on
working longer. Table 2 and Figure 11 present the SPA reforms: a gradual increase by one or
three months depending on the year and month of birth and effective in the calendar year
individuals reach their SPA age.

We analyze the impact of SPA on men’s employment rates around the age of 65 using a
difference-in-difference methodology (Angrist and Pischke 2009). Figures 12 and 13 are
based on regression results and show predicted employment rates by age and year. That is,
the years signify the reforms listed in Table 1. Figure 12 shows the impact of an SPA increase
from age 65 to age 65 plus one month; an increase that occurred between 2012 and 2013. As
this figure shows, the employment rate of individuals aged 65 plus one month who are
affected by this reform increases to the level for individuals who are 64 years plus 11 months
of age. This increase is statistically significant at the 1% level. That is, almost all of them
remain employed at the age of 65 plus one month. Individuals aged 65 plus 7 months are not

21

affected by the SP reforms during these years. That is, during those years, employment rates
at 64 plus 11 months and 65 plus 7 months serve as upper and lower bounds, respectively.
Next, Figure 13 shows the employment rates related to all the step-wise increases in SPA
until 2016. This Figure shows that a one month increase in SPA leads to workers, on average,
working one month longer. This is shows up in Figures 12 and 13 as approximately 10
percentage point increases in the employment rate (the “jumps”). This increase is statistically
significant at the one percent level.

Conclusions

The findings of this chapter show the importance of incentives provided by social security
programs for the pathways to retirement and working longer. Implicit tax rates on working
are a measure of the financial incentives to exit the labor force. The implicit tax rates show
for the various pathways that (i) DI remains an attractive option (if eligible), (ii) UI has been
an attractive option for older workers (if eligible) until 2004 after which the scheme became
less generous, and, (iii) early retirement remained an attractive option until 2006, after which
ER pensions became close to being actuarially fair. Regarding state pensions, the SPA has
since 2013 step-wise been increased but the benefits remained unchanged.
Given eligibility for DI, UI and/or ER/SP, retiring considerably earlier than the State Pension
Age (65 until 2013) used to be a financially attractive decision, at least between 1987 and
2004. UI and ER have become less attractive options, and nowadays the financial incentives
23

for these schemes no longer encourage early retirement. For persons eligible for DI the
financial incentive to retire has hardly changed but here eligibility appears to have been
successfully reduced by the most recent reform in 2006. Generally, the Netherlands has seen
a vast number of reforms, which makes empirically assessing the effect of each individual
reform difficult. Nevertheless, the combined reforms of SSPs seem to have had large positive
effects on employment at older ages.
We have shown, using the step-wise increase in SPA from 2013 onwards, that an increase in
SPA leads to working longer. Whilst this effect is strong, we cannot identify the mechanisms
that play a role in this relationship. As noted before, employment protection terminates at
SPA, so at least one mechanism is that employers can initiate severance without facing
severance costs. On the other hand, workers could still exit at age 65 if they wanted to. It
appears however that generally this does not happen. This may indicate a preference for
working longer, or adoption of a shifting social norm whereby one is expected to keep
working until SPA. A third factor is that state pensions are received from SPA onwards.
Liquidity constrained workers may therefore prefer to keep working until their income is
supplemented with SP. Identifying the relative roles of the various mechanisms is of
importance for evaluating the welfare implications of an increase in SPA. Nevertheless, it is
likely that the continuing increase in SPA will further increase employment at older ages.
