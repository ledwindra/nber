    "abstract": "\n\nScholars have argued that powerful individuals can exert influence on the path of a nation\u2019s development. Yet, the process through which individuals can have an effect on macro-level political economy outcomes remains unclear. This study uses the deadliest civil war in modern history, the Taiping Rebellion (1850\u20131864), to elucidate how one individual\u2014Zeng Guofan\u2014employed his personal elite networks to organize an army to suppress the rebellion, and how these networks would affect the nation\u2019s power distribution. Two findings stand out: (i) counties that already had more pre-war elites in Zeng\u2019s networks experienced an increase in soldier deaths after he took power; and (ii) post-war political power shifted significantly toward the home counties of these very elites, creating a less balanced national-level power distribution. Our findings highlight how micro-level elite networks can influence national politics and societal power distribution, shedding new light on the relationship between elites, war and the state.\n\n",
