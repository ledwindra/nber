Comparing IV With Structural Models: What Simple IV Can and Cannot Identify
James J. Heckman and Sergio Urzua
NBER Working Paper No. 14706
February 2009
JEL No. C31
ABSTRACT
This paper compares the economic questions addressed by instrumental variables estimators with those
addressed by structural approaches. We discuss Marschak's Maxim: estimators should be selected
on the basis of their ability to answer well-posed economic problems with minimal assumptions. A
key identifying assumption that allows structural methods to be more informative than IV can be tested
with data and does not have to be imposed.

Introduction

The primary question regarding the choice of an empirical approach to analyzing economic data
should be What economic question does the analyst seek to answer? Explicit economic models
make it easier to formulate and answer economic questions. Advocates of atheoretical approaches
to analyzing economic data appeal to randomization as an ideal and invoke IV (or matching or
regression discontinuity designs) as a surrogate for randomization. However, even perfectly executed
randomizations do not answer all questions of economic interest. There are important examples
where structural models produce more information about preferences than experiments.1
A valid instrument is not guaranteed to identify parameters of economic interest when responses
to choices vary among individuals, and these variations inﬂuence choices taken.2 Diﬀerent valid
instruments answer diﬀerent questions.3 The sign of the IV estimator can be diﬀerent from that of
the true causal eﬀect.4
No one trained in economics can doubt the value of credible, explicit economic models in
interpreting economic data. They are designed to answer a variety of well-posed economic questions
and to be invariant to classes of policy interventions.5 The problem with this approach is that
after 60 years of experience with ﬁtting structural models on a variety of data sources, empirical
economists have come to appreciate the practical diﬃculty in identifying, and precisely estimating,
the full array of structural parameters that answer the large variety of policy questions contemplated
by the Cowles Commission economists — the fathers of structural estimation.6
Proponents of IV are less ambitious in the range of questions they seek to answer. The method
often gains precision by asking narrower questions. The problem that plagues the IV approach is
that the questions it answers are usually deﬁned as probability limits of estimators and not by wellformulated economic problems. Unspeciﬁed “eﬀects” replace clearly deﬁned economic parameters

selection on unobservables. Regression discontinuity estimators identify, at best, local eﬀects.

Building on this point, Heckman, Schmierer, and Urzua (2008) develop and apply nonparametric tests for the
presence of heterogenous responses to treatment on which agents make choices.

Pencavel (1986) summarizes structural estimates of taxes on labor supply and reports absurd estimates, including
one due to Jerry Hausman, which implied a negative marginal propensity to consume goods out of income. These
and other estimates, reported in the literature some 20 years ago, fueled the ﬂight of many empirical economists from
structural models.

as the objects of empirical interest.
As noted by Marschak (1953), there is a middle ground. Marschak’s Maxim emphasizes that
one should solve well-posed economic problems with minimal assumptions. Marschak noted that
for many problems of policy analysis, it is not necessary to identify fully speciﬁed structural models
with parameters that are invariant to classes of policy modiﬁcations — the goal of structural analysis
as conceived by the Cowles pioneers and successor generations of structural economists.7 All that
is required to conduct many policy analyses or to answer many well-posed economic questions are
combinations of the structural parameters that are often much easier to identify than the individual
parameters themselves.8
Heckman and Vytlacil (1999, 2005) bridge the structural and IV literatures. They develop
an economically interpretable parameter — the marginal treatment eﬀect (MTE) — which is a
marginal willingness to pay for the beneﬁt of treatment for persons at well-deﬁned margins of
choice. It is invariant to a class of policy modiﬁcations. They show how diﬀerent instrumental
variables weight the MTE diﬀerently. These weights need not be positive for all values of the
argument of the MTE.9 For classes of well-posed economic questions, it is possible, under the
conditions given in Heckman and Vytlacil (2005), to fashion functions of instruments that answer
well-posed economic questions. This approach is unusual in the standard IV literature, which
traditionally deﬁnes the parameter of interest to be an “eﬀect” identiﬁed by an instrument.
Many economists follow Imbens and Angrist (1994) and interpret IV as identifying a weighted
average of the gains to persons induced to change their choice (or state) by a change in the instrument. Imbens and Angrist work with a two choice model. Heckman, Urzua, and Vytlacil (2006,
2008) and Heckman and Vytlacil (2007b) extend this analysis to an ordered choice model and to
general unordered choice models.10 This paper develops the unordered case further and gives a

Heckman and Vytlacil (2007a) deﬁne structural models precisely following the seminal deﬁnition of Hurwicz
(1962). These discussions formalize ideas in Marschak (1953).
8
See the discussion in Heckman (2008) and Heckman and Vytlacil (2007b).
9
MTE was introduced into the literature in the context of a selection model by Björklund and Moﬃtt (1987). The
Local Average Treatment Eﬀect (LATE) (Imbens and Angrist, 1994) is a discretized version of the MTE. The weights
for special cases were derived by Yitzhaki (1989) and applied by Imbens and Angrist (1994). Those weights are always
non-negative. Heckman and Vytlacil (1999, 2005, 2007b) and Heckman, Urzua, and Vytlacil (2006) generalize the
Imbens-Angrist-Yitzhaki analysis to the case of multiple instruments without restrictions and show how IV weights
can be non-positive over certain intervals, but that they must integrate to one.
10
Angrist and Imbens (1995) propose an ordered choice version of their 1994 paper. As shown by Heckman,
Urzua, and Vytlacil (2006), their proposed extension has unsatisfactory features which can be removed by a careful
reformulation of the IV method applied to the ordered choice model. See also Heckman and Vytlacil (2007b).

precise characterization of the generalization of the MTE that is appropriate for this case.
The original Imbens-Angrist intuition applies, but in general unordered choice models, agents
attracted into a state by a change in an instrument come from many origin states, so there are many
margins of choice. Structural models can identify the gains arising from these separate margins.
This is a diﬃcult task for IV without invoking structural assumptions. Structural models can also
identify the fraction of persons induced into a state coming from each origin state. IV alone cannot.
For some economic questions, these are unimportant distinctions. For others, they are crucial.
For speciﬁcity, consider an analysis of the GED program. The GED is a test by which high school
dropouts can exam certify to be the equivalents of ordinary high school graduates. Heckman,
LaFontaine, and Rodrı́guez (2008) show that the presence of a GED program induces some persons
to drop out of high school. It also induces some persons who would remain dropouts to exam
certify. Within this context we ask: What are the wage beneﬁts for those induced to take the GED
from the dropout state? For those induced to drop out of high school? What proportion of persons
induced to take a GED come from each of the other states?
IV cannot answer these questions except under structural assumptions. It can identify the mean
gross gain to the GED for those induced to take it, compared to the next best alternative. This is
a weighted average of the eﬀects from each possible origin state that the structural approach can
separately identify. In the IV approach, when there are multiple origin states, the weights on the
individual eﬀects cannot be estimated without using structural methods. As shown in Heckman
and Vytlacil (2007b), IV needs to be supplemented with explicit choice theory to answer many
interesting questions, including questions of economic welfare regarding introduction of policies as
well as distributional questions such as the percentage of persons harmed by a policy.
This paper demonstrates these points. We ﬁrst establish a precise framework for discussing IV,
and relating it to economic models.

The Choice Model and Assumptions

Following Heckman, Urzua, and Vytlacil (2006, 2008) and Heckman and Vytlacil (2007b), consider
the following model with multiple choices and associated multiple outcome states. Let J denote
the agent’s choice set, where J contains a ﬁnite number of elements. For example, J enumerates

4

possible schooling states (e.g., GED, high school dropout, high school graduate). The value to the
agent of choosing j ∈ J is
Rj (Zj ) = ϑj (Zj ) − Vj ,

(2.1)

where Zj are the agent’s observed characteristics that aﬀect the utility from choosing j, and Vj is
the unobserved shock to the agent’s utility from choice j. We sometimes write Rj for Rj (Zj ) to
simplify notation. Let Z denote the random vector containing all unique elements of {Zj }j∈J . We
write Rj (Z) for Rj (Zj ), leaving implicit the condition that Rj (·) only depends on the elements of
Z that are contained in Zj . Let Dj be a variable indicating whether the agent would choose j if
confronted with choice set J :11

Dj =

⎧
⎪
⎪
⎨1

if Rj ≥ Rk

⎪
⎪
⎩0

otherwise.

∀k∈J

Array the Dj into a vector D. Let Y be the outcome that would be observed if the agent faced
choice set J , deﬁned as
Y =

�

Dj Yj ,

j∈J

where Yj is a potential outcome observed only if option j is chosen. Yj is determined by

Yj = µj (Xj , Uj ),

where Xj is a vector of the agent’s observed characteristics and Uj is an unobserved random vector.
Let X denote the random vector containing all unique elements of {Xj }j∈J . (Z, X, D, Y ) is assumed
to be observed by the analyst.12
11

Below, we invoke conditions so that ties, Rj = Rk for j =
� k, occur with probability zero.
Depending on the choice model, Z may or may not include the X. For example, in a Roy model of schooling under
perfect certainty (e.g. Willis and Rosen, 1979), X would be among the Z. In models of schooling under uncertainty
(e.g. Cunha, Heckman, and Navarro, 2005, Cunha and Heckman, 2007 and Urzua, 2008) innovations in X unknown
at the time schooling decisions are made would not be in Z. The key condition on Z is given in Assumption (A-2)
below.
12

Deﬁne RJ as the maximum obtainable value given choice set J :
RJ

= maxj∈J {Rj }
�
=
j∈J Dj Rj .

(2.2)

This is the traditional representation of the decision process that if choice j is optimal, choice j is
better than the “next best” option:

Dj = 1 ⇐⇒ Rj ≥ RJ \j .
Heckman, Urzua, and Vytlacil (2006, 2008) and Heckman and Vytlacil (2007b) show that this
simple, well-known, representation is the key intuition for understanding how instrumental variables
estimate the eﬀect of a given choice versus the “next best” alternative. IV is a weighted average
of the eﬀects for people induced into a choice from diﬀerent margins. Analogous to the deﬁnition
of RJ , we deﬁne RJ (z) to be the maximum obtainable value given choice set J when instruments
are ﬁxed at Z = z,
RJ (z) = max{Rj (z)}.
j∈J

Following the analysis in Heckman, Urzua, and Vytlacil (2006, 2008) and Heckman and Vytlacil
(2007b), we assume:
(A-1) The distribution of ({Vj }j∈J ) is continuous.13
(A-2) {(Vj , Uj )}j∈J is independent of Z conditional on X.
(A-3) E | Yj | < ∞ for all j ∈ J .
(A-4) Pr(Dj = 1 | X) > 0 for all j ∈ J .
In addition, we assume an exclusion restriction that requires some additional notation.14 Let
Z [−l] denote all elements of Z except for the lth component. We assume
13

�
Absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure on j∈J �.
14
We work here with exclusion restrictions in part for ease of exposition. By adapting the analysis of Cameron
and Heckman (1998) and Heckman and Navarro (2007), one can modify our analysis for the case of no exclusion
restrictions if Z contains a suﬃcient number of continuous variables and there is suﬃcient variation in the ϑk function
across k.

6

(A-5) For each j ∈ J , their exists at least one element of Z, say Z [l] , such that the distribution of
ϑj (Zj ) conditional on (X, Z [−l] ) is continuous.
With these assumptions, one can generalize the analysis of Heckman and Vytlacil (1999, 2001,
2005) to the unordered case. Assumptions (A-1) and (A-2) imply that Rj =
� Rk (with probability
1) for j �= k, so that argmaxj∈J {Rj } is unique (with probability 1). Assumption (A-2) assures the
existence of an instrument. Assumption (A-3) is required for mean treatment parameters to be well
deﬁned. It also allows one to integrate to the limit and to produce well-deﬁned means. Assumption
(A-4) requires that at least some individuals participate in each choice for all X. Assumption
(A-5) imposes the requirement that one be able to independently vary the index for the given value
function. It imposes a type of exclusion restriction, that for any j ∈ J , Z contains an element
� j, and (iii) ϑj (·) is a
such that (i) it is contained in Zj ; (ii) it is not contained in any Zk for k =
nontrivial function of that element conditional on all other regressors.15
In a series of papers, Heckman and Vytlacil (1999, 2001, 2005, 2007b), develop the method of
local instrumental variables (LIV) to estimate the marginal treatment eﬀect (MTE) for the case of
binary choices. We now deﬁne and interpret the MTE and LIV in the case of general unordered
choices.

3

Interpreting Local Instrumental Variables in the Unordered Case

We deﬁne local instrumental variables (LIV) using a variable that shifts people toward (or against)
choice j by operating only on Rj (Zj ). LIV identiﬁes an average marginal return to j vs. the next
best alternative across persons.16 However, without further assumptions, LIV will not decompose
the average marginal return into its component parts corresponding to the eﬀects for persons
induced into j from each of the possible origin states.
To see this, consider a three outcome case, J = {1, 2, 3}. For concreteness, we pursue the
education example previously stated and let 1 be GED, 2 be high school dropout, and 3 be high
school graduate. Our results are more general but the three outcome case is easy to exposit.
In this section, we assume that Z1 , Z2 , Z3 are disjoint sets of regressors so Z = (Z1 , Z2 , Z3 )

but they are not necessarily statistically independent. We can easily relax this assumption but it
simpliﬁes the notation. We condition on X and keep it implicit throughout the analysis of this
paper.17 In this notation,

E(Y |Z) and its components can be estimated from data on (Y, Z). IV is based on (3.1). From
(2.2), choices are generated by the following inequalities:

D1 = 1 (R1 ≥ R2 , R1 ≥ R3 )
D2 = 1 (R2 ≥ R1 , R2 ≥ R3 )
D3 = 1 (R3 ≥ R1 , R3 ≥ R2 ) .

alternative state by a change in the instrument.

This is a weighted return to alternative 1 for persons coming from two separate margins: alternative
1 versus alternative 2, and alternative 1 versus alternative 3, i.e., the return to people induced into
1 from their next best choice. The weights are the proportion of people induced into 1 from each
margin. This combination of parameters can be identiﬁed from IV. The components of the sum
cannot be identiﬁed by IV without further assumptions. Note that it is possible that a group at one
margin gains while a group at another margin loses. IV only estimates a net eﬀect, which might
be zero.
Notice that from representation (2.1) and the assumption that the Zj (j�J ) are distinct, pairwise
monotonicity, an extension of the monotonicity assumption invoked by Imbens and Angrist (1994)
for the binary choice case, is satisﬁed.20 In the context of a model with multiple choices, pairwise
monotonicity means the same pattern of ﬂow between any two states is experienced by everyone.
Thus, as Zj increases, there is a ﬂow from i to j but not from j to i (or vice versa). From (2.1),
changing Z1 induces all persons to move in the same direction (i.e. from 1 to 2 or 2 to 1 but
not both, and from 1 to 3 or 3 to 1 but not both). Pairwise monotonicity does not rule out the

presented in Abbring and Heckman (2007).

Using a structural model, one can estimate the components of (3.5) and determine the ﬂow into
(or out of) state 1 from all sources. We illustrate this point in Section 5. First we consider what
standard IV estimates.

What does standard IV estimate?

To see what standard IV estimates, consider the following linear-in-schooling model of earnings
that receives much attention in the literature in labor economics.23 Let Y denote log earnings and
write S as years of schooling. The model writes

and Y is deﬁned as in Section 2. It is interpreted in this section as an approximation to the general
model presented in Section 2. S is assumed to be correlated with U , and β is a random variable
that may be statistically dependent on S. The model of Section 2 does not, in general, imply (4.1).
22
See Heckman and Vytlacil (2007b) who show how to vary Z3 or Z2 to eﬀectively shut down one margin of
choice. Speciﬁcally, for any ﬁxed Z1 = z1 , if limZ2 →Z˜2 R2 (Z2 ) → −∞ and limZ3 →Z˜3 R3 (Z3 ) → −∞ where Z̃2 and Z̃3
represent limit sets, then we can identify, respectively, the gains at the 3 → 1 margin in the limit set, and the gains
in the 2 → 1 margin in the limit set. These assumptions require that one can vary Z2 and Z3 to shut down one or
the other margin of choice. Under these assumptions and some additional mild regularity assumptions, the structural
approach can identify distributions of (Y1 − Y2 ) and (Y2 − Y3 ) as we demonstrate in the example in Section 5 of this
paper.

We keep conditioning on X implicit.

Indeed, there is much empirical evidence against model (4.1).24 An analysis of what IV estimates
when linearity in S is imposed as an approximation, even though it may be inappropriate, is an
interesting exercise because linearity is so often invoked.
Suppose Z1 is a valid instrument. We now interpret what

Z1 into components analogous to the decomposition produced by Heckman, Urzua, and Vytlacil (2006, 2008) and Heckman and Vytlacil (2007b). The

IV identiﬁes a weighted average of gains to state 1 compared to the next best alternative which
may be 2 or 3. The two terms of the decomposition are deﬁned as generalized MTEs and are
weighted averages of the gain of moving from state 2 to state 1 for persons on the margin of

See Heckman, Lochner, and Todd (2006) for discussions of this model and various justiﬁcations for it. Heckman,

indiﬀerence between 1 and 2 and for whom 2 is a better choice than 3 (the ﬁrst term) and the gain
of moving from 3 to 1 for persons on the margin of indiﬀerence between 1 and 3 and for whom 3
is a better choice than 2 (the second term).25
In the Appendix, we derive the weights on the generalized MTEs and show that they do not
sum to 1 even when normalized by the denominator. The mathematical reason for this result is
simple. The weights in the numerator do not sum to the weights in the denominator. The second
term in the denominator receives twice as much weight as the corresponding term in the numerator.
This is a consequence of the deﬁnition of S (4.2), which plays no role in the numerator term. Thus,
IV applied to the general model produces an arbitrarily weighted sum of generalized MTEs with
weights that do not sum to 1, and which, in general, places more weight on the ﬁrst generalized
MTE term than on the second term, compared to the weights placed on the corresponding terms
in the denominator.26 Using IV alone, we cannot decompose (4.4) into its component parts, even
though the weights can be identiﬁed from discrete choice analysis.27,28
25

Since Z1 only aﬀects R(Z1 ), it has no direct eﬀect on the margin 2 → 3.
Thus “2” appears only in the denominator and not in the numerator.
27
The structural model is nonparametrically identiﬁed under the conditions in Appendix B of Heckman and Vytlacil
(2007a).
28
Decomposition (4.4) is not unique. It arises from decomposing Y into
26

Y = D1 Y1 + D2 Y2 + D3 Y3
where we solve out D1 = 1 − D2 − D3 , to obtain
Y = Y1 + D2 (Y2 − Y1 ) + D3 (Y3 − Y1 ).
We could also solve out D2 = 1 − D1 − D3 to obtain
Y = Y2 + D1 (Y1 − Y2 ) + D3 (Y3 − Y2 )
or D3 = 1 − D1 − D2 to obtain
Y = Y3 + D1 (Y1 − Y3 ) + D2 (Y2 − Y3 ).
Each decomposition can be used to represent ΔIV
Z1 . For each decomposition, the leading terms on the right-hand
side, (Y1 , Y2 , Y3 ), respectively, are uncorrelated with Z1 by virtue of (A-2). Corresponding generalized MTEs can be
deﬁned for each decomposition. Z1 aﬀects the lower boundary of the opportunity set in
E(Y2 − Y3 |R(z2 ) ≥ R(z1 ), R(z3 ) ≥ R(z1 )).
We choose the decomposition reported in the text for its greater interpretability.

The Mincer Model

The Mincer (1974) model is a specialization of the general model discussed in Section 2 of this
paper that justiﬁes the precise functional form of equation (4.1).29 For this case, the weights in
(4.4) in the numerator and denominator are the same. The Mincer model is formulated in terms
of log earnings for Y1 , Y2 , and Y3 :

Y2 = ln (1 + g) + Y1 ,
Y3 = ln (1 + g) + Y2 = 2 ln(1 + g) + Y1 ,
where g is a growth factor for income that varies in the population. Earnings at each schooling
level depend on two parameters: (g, Y1 ). In this case, letting α = ln(1 + g),

In this case, the weights now sum to 1. The weights for the numerator term now are the same
as the weights for the denominator term. But again, unaided IV does not identify the component
parts of the term bundled in IV — the mean gains at each margin.30,31
29

See Heckman, Lochner, and Todd (2006) for a discussion of the Mincer Model and the powerful body of evidence
against it. Card (2001) provides one justiﬁcation for functional form 4.1.
30
An anonymous referee has correctly expressed the concern that in the case of an income-maximizing Mincer
model under perfect certainty, the general unordered model would not apply. Indeed, the decision problem is not well
deﬁned. If g > r, the opportunity cost of funds, agents would choose the maximum amount of schooling. If g < r,
the agent chooses no schooling. If g = r, the agent is indiﬀerent to all levels of schooling. Thus, for our analysis to
apply to the Mincer earnings equation, we have to assume that choices involve some combination of psychic costs,
tuition, uncertainty or the like. The model of Keane and Wolpin (1997) is one of many frameworks that would justify
an unordered choice model but could be consistent with a Mincer earnings equation. See Heckman, Lochner, and
Todd (2006). We thank the referee for emphasizing this point to us.
31
Decomposition (4.6) for an ordered choice model is presented in Heckman, Urzua, and Vytlacil (2006) and
Heckman and Vytlacil (2007b).

An Example

It is instructive to summarize our analysis with an example. Consider a 3 choice model with associated outcomes. This corresponds to the GED, high school dropout and high school graduate
example that we have used throughout the paper. Under conditions presented in Heckman and Vytlacil (2007a, Appendix B), the structural model is nonparametrically identiﬁed. A key assumption
in their proof is the “identiﬁcation at inﬁnity” assumption previously discussed.32 This assumes
the ability to vary (Z1 , Z2 , Z3 ) freely and the existence of limit sets such that ﬁxing any two of
(Z1 , Z2 , Z3 ), one makes the Rj associated with Zj arbitrarily small.33
Heckman and Vytlacil (2007b) show that if one augments the IV assumptions with the same
identiﬁcation at inﬁnity assumptions used in structural models, one can use IV in the limit to
identify the components of (3.5). In the limit sets, one can identify

E(Y1 − Y2 |R1 (z1 ) = R2 (z2 ))

(5.1)

E(Y1 − Y3 |R1 (z1 ) = R3 (z3 ))

(5.2)

and

by setting Z3 and Z2 respectively to limit set values. Essentially one can use the limit sets to make
a three choice model into a two choice model, and the standard results for the two choice model
apply.34 Under these assumptions, and additional mild regularity assumptions, using structural
methods, one can identify the distributions of (Y1 , Y2 ) and (Y1 , Y3 ) so that one can identify distributions of treatment eﬀects, Y2 − Y1 and Y3 − Y1 , in addition to the mean parameters identiﬁed
by IV.35 One can also identify the proportion of people induced into 1 from each alternative state
using variation in the instrument.
Consider the model with the parameters presented in Table 1. This is a discrete choice model
with associated outcome variables. The Zj , j = 1, . . . , 3, are assumed to be scalar and mutually
independent. They are normally distributed so they satisfy large support (“identiﬁcation at inﬁn32

Alternatively, one can make functional form assumptions about the distribution of the error terms.
See the conditions in footnote 22.

See Heckman and Vytlacil (2007b)

The literature on “quantile treatment eﬀects” uses IV to identify the quantiles of Y1 and Y2 separately but not
the quantiles of Y1 − Y2 . See Abbring and Heckman (2007).

ity”) conditions. Table 2 shows how a change in Z1 , which increases it by .75 standard deviations,
shifts people across categories. This corresponds to making GED attainment easier.36 The estimates reported in Table 2 can be obtained from a structural discrete choice model. The percentage
initially in 1 (GED) increases from 33.17% to 38.8%. The percentage in 2 (dropout) decreases from
29.11% to 25.91%. The percentage in 3 (graduating high school) declines from 37.72% to 35.29%.
The IV estimate is -.032. (See the base of Table 3) This is the only number produced by an IV
analysis using Z1 as an instrument that changes within the speciﬁed range. The structural analysis
in Table 3 shows that the net eﬀect produced by the change in Z1 is composed of 2 terms. It arises
from a gain of .199 for the switchers 2 → 1 (dropout to GED) and a loss of .336 (3 → 1) (graduate
to GED).
Figure 1 shows what can be identiﬁed from the structural model. It plots the distributions of
gains for persons going from 2 to 1 and from 3 to 1 as well as the overall distribution of gains to
the switchers. Persons switching from 3 to 1 are harmed in gross terms by the policy that changes
Z1 , while those who switch from 2 to 1 gain in gross terms. In utility terms, (Rj ), people are
better oﬀ.37 In terms of gross gains, about 56.8% of the people who switch from 2 to 1 are better
oﬀ while 39.3% of the people who switch from 3 to 1 are better oﬀ. Overall, 49.2% are better oﬀ
in gross terms even though the IV estimate is slightly negative. If one seeks to understand the
distributional eﬀects of the policy associated with a change Z1 , the structural analysis is clearly
much more revealing. The IV estimate, which is a mean gross gain aggregating over origin states,
does not capture the rich information about choices aﬀorded by a structural analysis. However, it
does identify the average gain to the program compared to the next-best alternatives. If that is
the object of interest, linear IV is the right tool to use.

Summary and Discussion

The choice between using IV or a more structural approach for a particular problem should be
made on the basis of Marschak’s Maxim: use minimal assumptions to answer well-posed economic
questions. Most IV studies do not clearly formulate the economic question being answered by the
36

Heckman, LaFontaine, and Rodrı́guez (2008) show that easing GED requirements promotes dropping out of
school and causes some dropouts to become GEDs.

This is imposed in a discrete choice model.

IV analysis. The probability limit of the IV estimator is deﬁned to be the object of interest. In
the binary outcome case, even if Z is a valid instrument, if Z is a vector, and analysts use only one
component of the vector as an instrument, and do not condition on the other components of Z,
the weights on the MTE can be negative over certain ranges. The practice of not conditioning on
the other instruments is common in the literature.38 IV can estimate the wrong sign for the true
causal eﬀect.39 Recent analyses show how to improve on this practice and to design functions of
standard instrumental variables that answer classes of well-posed economic questions.40
We have discussed a model with three or more choices where there is no particular order among
the choices. Such examples arise routinely in applied economics. In this case, under conditions
speciﬁed in this paper, IV estimates a weighted average of the mean gross gain to persons induced
into a choice state by a change in the instrument (policy) compared to their next best alternative.41 It averages the returns to a destination state over all origin states. It does not produce the
distribution of gains overall or by each origin state. Again, as in the binary choice case, for vector
Z, using one component of Z as an instrument, and not conditioning on the other components can
produce negative weights so that the sign of an IV can be opposite to that of the true causal eﬀect
which can be identiﬁed by a structural analysis.
Structural methods provide a more complete description of the eﬀect of the instrument or the
policy associated with the instrument. They identify mean returns as well as distributions of returns
for agents coming to a destination state from each margin. They also identify the proportion of
people induced into a state from each origin state.
Structural methods come at a cost. Unless distributional assumptions for unobservables are
invoked, structural methods require some form of an “identiﬁcation at inﬁnity” assumption.42
However, in the general case in which responses to treatment are heterogeneous, IV requires the
same assumption if one seeks to identify average treatment eﬀects.43 An identiﬁcation at inﬁnity
assumption can be checked in any sample so it does not require imposing a priori beliefs onto the
data. Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua (2006) present an example of how to test an identiﬁcation at

inﬁnity assumption. See also the discussion in Abbring and Heckman (2007).44
Many proponents of IV point to the strong distributional and functional form assumptions
required to implement structural methods. They ignore recent progress in econometrics that identiﬁes and empirically implements robust semiparametric and nonparametric approaches to structural analysis.45 Recent developments respond to arguments against the use of explicit econometric
models made by a generation of applied economists that emerged in the 1980s. Those arguments
are more properly directed against 1980s versions of structural models that were based on linearity
and normality. Structural econometricians in the 21st century have listened to the critics and have
perfected their tools to response to the criticism.
The appeal to standard IV as a preferred estimator is sometimes made on the basis of “simplicity and robustness”. Standard IV is certainly simple to compute although problems with weak
instruments can make it empirically unstable.46 Since, in the general case, diﬀerent instruments
identify diﬀerent parameters, IV is not robust to the choice of instrument.47 Since the sign of an
IV can be diﬀerent from the true causal eﬀect, IV may even produce a misleading guide to policy
or inference, so it is not robust.
The meaning of “simplicity” is highly subjective. How simple is the economic interpretation
of IV? Certainly decomposition (4.4) is not simple. The fact that simple IV can estimate wrong
signs for true causal eﬀects should give pause to those who claim that it is “robust”. The weak
instrument literature cautions us against uncritical claims about the sturdiness of IV estimators.
The ability of diﬀerent statistical estimators to answer questions of economic interest, or to show
why they cannot be answered, should drive the choice of empirical techniques for analyzing data.
Consider a worst case for structural estimation. Suppose that application of recently developed
procedures for testing for structural identiﬁcation reveal that a structural model is not identiﬁed
or is only partially identiﬁed. Does this conclusion suggest that IV is a better choice for an
estimator? That disguising identiﬁcation problems by a statistical procedure is preferable to an
honest discussion of the limits of the data? For underidentiﬁed structural models, it is possible to
44

However, this assumption is not yet routinely checked in many structural analyses.
See e.g. Abbring and Heckman (2007), Carneiro, Hansen, and Heckman (2003), Cunha, Heckman, and Navarro
(2007), Cunha, Heckman, and Schennach (2006, revised 2008), and Matzkin (1992, 1993, 2007). These recent developments in robust structural modeling have not yet made their way into widespread use in empirical structural
analysis.

conduct sensitivity analyses guided by economic theory to explore the consequences of ignorance
about features of the model. With IV, unaided by structural analysis, this type of exercise is not
possible. Problems of identiﬁcation and interpretation are swept under the rug and replaced by
“an eﬀect” identiﬁed by IV that is often very diﬃcult to interpret as an answer to an interesting
economic question.

Derivation of the Standard IV Estimator

We ﬁrst study the numerator of ΔIV
Z1 in the text. Recall that we keep the conditioning on X implicit.
Using Z̃1 = Z1 − Z̄1 ,

Cov (Y, Z1 ) = E Z˜1 (Y1 D1 + Y2 D2 + Y3 D3 ) .
Using D1 = 1 − D2 − D3 , we obtain

where E Z˜1 Y1 = 0. It is natural to decompose this expression using choice “1” as the base,

These terms can be identiﬁed from a structural analysis using the joint distribution of (Z, D1 , D2 , D3 ).
Collecting results, we obtain decomposition (4.4) in the text if we multiply both the numerator and
denominator by -1.
