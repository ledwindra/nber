Introduction
In recent years we have

witnessed

analysis of fiscal policies. Dynamic

some important developments in the

models

of taxation in closed and open

economies have become part of the economists' tool box; issues regarding

Ricardian neutrality, or lack of it, are topics of daily discussions. We
now have (or we think we have) a clear idea of what will happen to the key
macro variables such as the price level, interest rates, the real exchange

rate, wages,

unemployment, and so on when there are different fiscal shocks.

However, moderrt economic analyses have until recently failed to fully

address the key question of ii determines a country's fiscal policy. In a
phrase, the problem is that economists most of the time treat the

policymaker as a machine that can be programmed. Once the right policy has
been singled out, the economist's task is over: it is up to the policy-

maker-machine to implement it. This is a serious limitation of the
traditional approach to the theory of economic policy. Policyrnakers, just
like every other economic agent, behave purposefully and respond to

incentives and constraints. There is little doubt that the Argentinian
authorities, for example, have a fairly clear idea of what are the consequences of accelerating the rate of growth of domestic credit on inflation,

the balance of payments, capital flight and so on. Still, even knowing

these consequences they chose to go ahead. Why? To answer this question,
one needs to formulate a positive theory of how policymakers behave.
A small but growing body of literature has recently pursued this
positive approach to the theory of monetary and fiscal policy, building on

insights developed from game theory and theory of the public choice. Most
of this literature, however, has been theoretical and has dealt almost
exclusively with the advanced nations.

2

In this paper we do two things: first we review this positive approach
to economic policy, analyzing its applicability to the cue of the developing countries. In doing this broad review, we extend some models, propose
new theories and report some new results obtained during the course of our

own research. Second, we provide new empirical evidence on the fiscal and
monetary behavior of developing countries. This empirical investigation
yields a general lesson: political institutions and political incentives
are central determinants of observed economic policies.2

The paper is organized in two parts. The first reviews the recent
literature on the theory of inflation and investigates the empirical

evidence on time series and cross-country data. We find that this evidence
is inconsistent with the conclusions of the theory of optimal taxation. We
also find that inflation is very strongly related to different measures of

political instability. The second part of the paper reviews the theory and
the evidence on government budget deficits. Again, the central finding is
that more unstable political systems tend to be associated with larger

government borrowing. The paper ends with a brief concluding section that
proposes new directions for future research.

II. Inflation
In this section we systematically analyze the theory and evidence on

inflation for a large group of developing countries. We start by providing
a broad analysis of the data and then move to test alternative theories on
the long run determinants of inflation.

11.1 The Inflation Tax
Table 1 contains data on inflation and seignorage for 52 developing

countries for different subperiods 1963 and l987. For each of them we have

3

computed the average rate of inflation of the consumer price index and the
average revenue from the inflation tax, expressed as a percentage of GDP.
For every year this revenue was calculated as:

R_!!

(1)

where w is the inflation rate, m is the monetary base and y is GDP.4
The last row of the table shows the standard deviation of these variables

across countries for each subperiod. All the data were obtained from the
most recent IFS tape.5
These figures strikingly illustrate a wide variability in the inflation

tax, both across countries and across time. First, in most countries there
is an important increase in the rate of the inflation tax in the late 1970s

and early 1980s. Second, the cross country variability is remarkable, both
regarding the rates as well as revenues. For the period 1963-73 the ratio
of higher to lower rate of the inflation tax was 41 times. For 1983-87 this

ratio had climbed to more than one thousand times!6 Similarly, between
these two subperiods the standard deviation of inflation across countries

increased by more than eight times. Third, in a number of countries,
increases in the rate of inflation resulted in a reduction of the inflation

tax revenue. Examples of this phenomenon are Ghana (73-78 vs. 78-83);
Ma].awj (73-78 vs. 78-83); Zaire (73-78 vs. 78-83); and Chile (63-73 vs. 73-

78). The extent of this phenomenon is probably greater than what is
apparent from Table 1, since, as argued by Tanzi (1977) and Olivera (1967),
inflation may reduce the base of other taxes -

- either

through encouraging

the underground economy or because of collection lags. Fourth, contrary to
the popular belief, we observe very wide differences in behavior within

Latin America. For example, in every period we can find some Latin American

4

countries with a very low rate

of

inflation; in fact, lower than the average

of the Asian nations. This is an important finding since it provides a

counterexample

to the popular 'cultural theory of inflation differentials

across countries. According to that view cultural reasons explain why Latin
America is fiscally irresponsible. Our data, however, show that Latin
America is far from being a homogeneous group. Thus, any good theory that
attempts to explain the determinants of fiscal policy and the inflation tax
should be capable of explaining the different behavior encountered within
the Latin American region.

Figures 1 through 3 depict the relationship between the rate of
inflation and the log of the inflation tax revenue for a group of selected

countries. These diagrams suggest that in most of these countries there is
indeed a Laffer curve type relation between the rate of inflation and the

inflation tax revenue. Moreover, they also suggest that at one point or
another some of these countries may indeed have been on the 'wrong sIde' of
this curve.

To sum up, then, the evidence presented here not only shows a wide
variety of cross-country experiences with the inflation tax, but also
suggest that the Inflation tax rate sometimes exceeds the rate that would

maximize revenues from this source. In the rest of this section we
investigate empirically a number of possible explanations for these observed

cross country differentials in inflation. We start by analyzing theories of
dynamical optimal taxation, and then proceed to investigate models that
focus on credibility constraints and political incentives.

11.2 The Theory of Optimal Taxation
A first important question is whether the observed pattern of the
inflation tax

can

be explained as the optimal government response to a

5

politically desired path of public spending. The modern theory of public
finance lends some support to this view. In the presence of tax evasion, or
if there are tax collection costs in administering other tax instruments, it
is optimal for the government to rely on the inflation tax (Aizenman (1987),

Faig (1988) and Kimbrough (1986)). Clearly, tax evasion and tax collection
costs are common-place in developing countries. Hence, according to the
theory of optimal taxation we should expect developing countries to rely on
the inflation tax as a source of revenue, the more so the larger are tax
collection costs and the larger is tax evasion.

Suppose that the government can use the inflation tax (w) and other

tax rates on output (r) to finance its expenditures. Both taxes are
distortionary and impose a welfare cost that is increasing on their rate.

The cost of the output tax rate is f(r) while that of the inflation tax is

h(s. Mankiw (1987) shows that in these circumstances the optimal tax
policy implies:

—

kf?(i.t)

(1)

where k is a parameter of the money demand function. Thus, at the optimum
the marginal cost of each tax

has

to be equated in every period. This

implies that as government expenditure changes, inflation and non-inflation

tax rates move together. Mankiw (1987) tested this implication using U.S.
data for 1951-82 and found a positive relationship between inflation and the

average tax rate. He interprets this finding as providing support for the
theory of optimal taxation as a positive theory of policy behavior.
More recently a number of authors have extended ?(ankiw's work both theor-

etically and empirically. Vittorio Grilli (1989) has pointed out that
Mankiw's tests fail some important implications of the theory, including the

6

fact that seignorage and income taxes should have a unit root and should be

cointegrated. His results for 10 European nations are mixed; in only some
countries seignorage has behaved as predicted by the optimal taxation theory.7
Poterba and Rotemberg (1990) aAke a distinction between governments

that can commit to a course of action and those that cannot. In their
model, in the commitment case inflation and taxes will be positively correlated, while in the absence of commitment inflation will be a positive
function of both taxes and total government liabilities as a percentage of

GNP. They estimate both versions of the model, using OLS and instrumental
variables, on time series data for five countries -.

France,

Germany, Japan,

the U.K., and the U.S. -- and conclude that for these nations the evidence
does not provide a generalized support to the optimal taxation view of

inflation. As in previous cases this theory only seems to hold for the case
of thq United States.

This type of work has recently been criticized on two counts. On one
hand, Dornbusch (1989) has pointed out that while the theory is based on
marginal tax rates, most (if not all) empirical tests have used computed

average rates. On the other hand, Judd (1990) points out that the welfare
costs of the inflation tax should be related to exoected inflation, rather

than to actual inflation. Thus, according to the theory of optimal taxation, tax rates and expected (but not necessarily actual) inflation should

move in the same direction. Moreover, any innovation in government spending
or the tax bases should result in unexpected changes in actual inflation.
While Judd's distinction between expected and unexpected inflation is

important, his argument tat only expected inflation has welfare costs is
not generally valid (for instance, it relies on the government neglecting
the redistributions within the private sector that are brought about by

7

unexpected inflation or deflation). We return to this point below.

11.3 Testing Theories of Ovtimal Taxation for LDCs

As

Grilli

(1989), among others, has pointed out, an important implica-

tion of the optimal taxation hypothesis is that both the inflation rate and

the tax rate should have a unit root. Table 2 contains augmented DickeyFuller unit root tests for these two variables for 21 countries with long

enough annual time series.8 In all cases, except inflation In India, the
unit root hypothesis is not rejected. However, a potential limitation of
these tests is the very short length of the time series. Indeed, it is well
known that as the number of observations is reduced the power of the augment-

ed Dickey-Fuller test greatly diminishes. For the case of inflation we can
get around this problem by using quarterly data.9 This is done in Table 3 we

report augmented Dickey-Fuller tests for a larger group of 44 countries. As
can be seen, as in the case of Table 2, for the vast majority of the countries the hypothesis that inflation follows a unit root cannot be rejected.
These results are not, however, sufficient evidence in favor of the

optimal taxation theory of inflation. Indeed, a unit root is a necessary
but not sufficient condition of the optimal taxation theory. In order to
provide strong support for this theory It is required that seignorage is

positively correlated with the rate of the income tax. To investigate this
aspect of the optimal taxation theory for the LDCs we estimated a Mankiw
type regression for the countries in Table 2:

MNF —

a0

+

a1

LTAX +

(2)

where INF is the yearly rate of Inflation and TAX is the (implicit) yearly
rate of tax on output computed, as In Table 2 and in Mankiw (1987), as the

ratio of tax revenues to GDP. If the theory of optimal taxation presented

8

above is correct,

would be significantly positive. Moreover, Mankiw

argues that it should be roughly equal to one)° The results obtained from
these regressions using both OLS and instrumental variables are reported in

Table 411 As can be seen, for most countries these results strongly reject
the hypothesis that there is a positive relation between the output tax rate

and the inflation tax rate. Other preliminary work, not reported here for
reasons of space, indicates that at the core of this rejection lies a strik-

ing stylized fact: the inflation tax often behaves as a residual source of
government revenue. It goes up when spending increases or when other
sources of revenue fall. There are a number of possible explanations for
these results.

12

But the simplest, and the one that we explore in the rest

of this paper, is that the theory of optimal taxation does not apply to
these countries; the alternative view that we analyze is the political
economy one.

11.4 Credibility and Inflation
Perhaps the simplest explanation of why governments do not behave
according to the theory of optimal taxation is that they lack credibility.
Since the work of Calvo (1978) and Kydland-Prescott (1977), it is well known
that the optimal inflation tax is tine-inconsistent in the absence of

binding policy commitments. In a credible (or tine consistent) equilibrium
with policy discretion, the government relies too much on the inflation tax.

Moreover, in any such equilibrium, the inflation tax is a residual: any
change in government spending is reflected one-for-one in higher inflation,

with little or no effect on other sources of revenue (see Persson-Tabellini
(1990)). Finally, as remarked in Calvo (1978) and more recently in PerssonTabellini (1990), policy discretion generally results in a multiplicity of

equilibria. Hence, any specific equilibrium is intrinsically fragi1e".

9

This may result in sudden bursts of accelerating inflation, accompanied by
devaluation. and speculative attacks on fixed exchange rate regimes.
These qualitative properties of models with policy discretion are
remarkably consistent with the empirical evidence reported in Subsection
11.3 on optimal taxation and with the evidence on devaluation crises (see

Edwards 1989). Moreover, they are robust: for instance, they would also
result (with some qualifications) from models in which even actual (and not
just expected) inflation is distorting or undesirable.
Recent developments of the literature on credibility have pointed out

that reputation can be a substitute for commitments. This suggests an obvi-

ous line of empirical attack: to try to explain differences in the observed
rates of inflation in various countries as due to differences in the

strength of reputational incentives in each country. Persson and Tabellini
(1990) have formulated a simple model of reputation with enough institution-

al content to yield positive predictions. The model is built on three

central assumptions: (i) unexpected policy actions disrupt the system of
expectations of private economic agents (for instance, leading to higier

expected inflation and to higher nominal wages); (ii) this disruption of
economic expectations has negative welfare effects on voters; (iii) electing a new government stabilizes expectations and, thus, reduces the extent

of the disruption. This model of reputation points out that the government
incentive to maintain its reputation has an important political dimension:
the cost of policy surprises is that the government is less likely to be

reappointed in office. The citizens realize that reappointing a government
who created policy surprises means higher expected inflation in the future,

and hence lover social welfare. Thus, they are less likely to reappoint it.
If the government cares about being in office, this punishment creates

10

incentives not to engage in policy surprises.
This model of reputation yields two central positive implications.

First, the equilibrium inflation rate is

higher

the more the citizens

disagree about which government they prefer to hold office. In other words,
more polarized and •heterogeneous societies encounter greater difficulty in

enforcing low inflation through reputational forces. Second, the equilibrium inflation rate tends to be higher the more unlikely it is that the

government currently in office will be reappointed. In other words, reputa-

tion is not very effective if the government is weak. Intuitively, the
threat of being thrown out of office becomes less powerful if society is very

polarized, or if the government is already weak. In the last case, this
occurs because a weak government has little to lose (since it is already

likely to be thrown out of office anyway). In the former case, it occurs
because if society is very polarized, citizens are unwilling to switch party
and punish a government because it just created policy surprises.

Table 5 reports some preliminary evidence consistent with these two

implications. This table reports the results of estimating an OLS regression of average inflation against various measures of political instability

and polarization, on cross-country data. Estimation is by seemingly
unrelated regressions (StiR). In the first specification of Table 5 (Panel

A), political instability is measured as the frequency of (regular and

irregular) government changes during the relevant time interval. In the
second specification we distinguish between the frequency of regular

government changes and the frequency of military coups. Since the latter
mode of government transfer is likely to involve a more radical change in
the ideology of the government, the frequency of coups is a measure of both

instability and polarization of the political system. The results are

11

striking: the estimated coefficients are almost always positive and often
highly significant. The same results are obtained if we replace the actual
frequency of government change with a measure of the expected probability of
a government change. estimated from a

probit

model. This alternative meas-

ure of political instability, used for the first time in Cukierisan, Edwards

and Tabellini (1989), is described in more detail in Section 11.5 below.
It should be noticed that the evidence reported in Table 5 could have
several other explanations, some of which will be addressed in later

sections of the paper. One of such explanations, however, is the one
summarized in the previous pages: more unstable and polarized countries
have greater credibility problems, because the reputational incentives of a

government are weaker.3

11.5 Long Run Seignoraze. Tax Reforms and Political Instability
In the previous subsections we presented empirical results based on a
number of alternative approaches to analyze the time series properties of

inflation and government debt in developing countries. We now turn to the
question of how to compare the long-run properties of these same variables
across countries.
According to the theory of optimal taxation discussed in Section 11.2,

the long-run characteristics of inflation and debt depend on the cost of

administering tax collection. High tax collection costs and tax evasion
force developing countries to rely on highly inefficient forms of taxation,

such as inflation or trade related taxes. This explanation raises a natural
question. Why do some countries have higher tax collection costs and higher
tax evasion than others? In the traditional development literature, this
question is answered by arguing that the taxing capacity of a country Is
technologically constrained by its stage of development and by the structure

12

of its economy: a country with a large agricultural sector, for instance,
is more susceptible to tax evasion than a country with a large corporate

manufacturing industry. Cukierman, Edwards and Tabellini (1989) have
explored an alternative answer to this question. Namely, that the
of the tax system of a

country

evolution

depends on the features of its political

system, and not just on those of its economy.
Their central idea can be stated as

follows.

An inefficient tax system

(i.e., one that facilitates tax evasion and imposes high tax collection
costs) acts as a constraint on the revenue collecting capacities of the

government. This constraint may be welcomed by those who disagree with the
goals pursued by the current government. In particular, a government (or a
legislative majority) may deliberately refrain from reforming a tax system,
for fear that a more efficient tax apparatus will be used in the future to
carry out spending or redistributive programs that the current government

disapproves of. Of course, this is more likely to happen in countries with
more unstable and polarized political systems. Hence, according to this
model, more unstable and polarized political systems rely on inefficient
taxes, such as seignorage and trade taxes, to a greater extent than more
stable and homogeneous countries.

Cuikerman, Edwards, Tabellini (CET) (1989) confront the data by
estimating an equation of the following form for a group of 79 countries:

y —
where

f(x,p)

y — fraction
x —

vector

of total revenue collected through seignorage

of variables measuring the available tax bases (such as

size of the manufacturing1 mining, and agricultural sectors,
size of imports and exports, per capita income, etc. -. see

13

Tait, Cratz and Eichengreen (1979)).

p —

vector

of political variables measuring the political

instability and/or polarization.

The question to be posed to the data concerns the role and explanatory power
of the political variables, once the economic variables relating to the stage
of development and the structure of the economy are being controlled for.
Perhaps the most difficult problem faced in this type of empirical analysis
in finding empirical counterparts for the analytical constructs 'political

instability' and 'political polarization.' With respect to the former CET
use an estimated cross-country probit equation to compute an index of the
probability of government change for a particular country in any given year.
This probit equation regresses instances of actual government changes against
political variables (riots, repressions, and so on), economic variables
(consumption growth, inflation, income per capita) and institutional

variables. With respect to polarization they use two alternative proxies:
(i) frequency of coup attempts; (ii) an index of income distribution. This
indicator differs from the index of actual frequency of government change
used in Table 5, in that it provides a measure of the expected probability of
government change, derived from broad cross country evidence.
In addition to the political instability index, in their regression
analysis of seignorage CET included the following structural variables:

(a) share of agriculture in GDP. Its sign is expected to be negative;
since it is relatively costly to tax agriculture, governments with a large
agricultural sector will tend to rely more heavily on taxes with low
administering cost, such as seignorage and trade taxes;

(b) share of

mining and manufacturing on GDP. Its sign is expected to be negative, also

for cost effective reasons; (c) foreign trade share on GDP. Its sign is

14

expected to be positive, since in an

open

economy it is easier to tax

international trade; (d) CDP per capita, whose sign is expected to be

negative. More advanced nations are

able

to implement more sophisticated

and efficient tax systems, and thus will tend to rely less heavily on easy

to collect but highly distortive taxes such as seignorage; and (e) urbanization ratio, whose sign is expected to be negative. The reason is that it
is relatively easier to tax the urban population than the rural population.

For a sample of 58 developing nations, CET obtained the following
results from an OLS regression (standard errors in parentheses) of
seignorage on political instability and other structural variables:14

Seignorage — -

0.020 + 0.0021

Share of Agriculture in CDP

(0.032) (0.0005)

(0.024E-5)

Urbanization +

0.1583 Political Instability Index
(0.0539)
—

0.448

S.E. — 0.049
These results are very suggestive. Not only does the regression explain
a high percentage of the cross-country variability of seigniorage, but all

variables have the expected sign.15 Moreover, the coefficient of the
political instability index is highly significant. When a broader group of
countries that includes industrialized nations was considered, the results

were similar to those reported here. All in all, then, the CET results
provide broad support for the hypothesis that, even after controlling for
other structural variables, political instability plays an important role in
explaining long-run cross-country differentials in inflation.

15

An interesting empirical extension of the CET model of strategic
political behavior and tax reform is that the use of other inefficient
taxes

such

as import tariffs and export taxes, should also be positively

related to political instability. That is, just as in the case of
seignorage, after controlling for other structural variables, political
instability and the reliance on taxes on foreign trade should be positively
related in cross-country data.
This conjecture is tested in Table 6 on a cross section of

industrialized and developing countries. The dependent variable is the ratio

of

trade taxes as a percentage of government revenues obtained from the IMF

Government Finance Statistics. The structural variables are the

same as

those discussed above and used by CET in their seignorage investigation. The
political variables are the estimated political instability index described
before, the observed frequency of regular (democratic) government change and

the frequency of coups. In addition, we incorporated a dummy variable for
industrialized nations and one for Latin American countries.

The results in Table 6 are mixed. First the coefficients for the
structural variables, with the exception of CDP per capita in two of the
regressions, have the expected sign, and some of them are highly significant.
Second, in both regressions where it is included, the political instability
index has the expected positive sign; however, in neither was its coefficient

significant. Third, when the frequency of coups is added, as a proxy for
political polarization, its coefficient is positive as expected but, again,

it is not significant at conventional levels. Moreover, in this last
regression, the frequency of regular government transfers has the wrong sign.
These less than fully satisfactory results on trade taxes contrast with
the highly supportive results obtained by CET (1989) for seigniorage

16

collection. A possible explanation for these differences in the results is

that,

contrary to the case of seigniorage, trade taxes

also piay an import-

ant role in determining the productive structur. of a country. Indeed, by
providing protection to certain sectors these types

of taxes shape

the

incentive structure of the economy. An additional difference between
seignorage and trade taxes that can be affecting these results is that,
while seignorage can be manipulated through administrative decisions,

changes

elements

in trade taxes usually require congressional approval. Once these
are incorporated into the analysis, the straightforward implication

of the CET model of strategic government behavior is not any longer
applicable to trade taxes.
The empirical evidence discussed in this section can be summarized as

follows: (1) the data for a large number of developing nations rejects the
optimal taxation hypothesis of seignorage. This means, then, that explanations of cross country differences in inflation and seignorage should be

sought outside of the realm of the optimal policy framework; (2) the
incorporation of political and institutional variables, such as frequency of

changes, military coups and a constructed political instability
index, indicate that these variables play an important role in explaining
government

cross

country variability in inflation. More specifically, we find evidence

supporting the empirical implications of the 'credibility-based theory' of
economic policy and of the political theory of strategic tax reforms.

III.

Fiscal Deficit
In this section we

investigate the evidence on government borrowing and

we attempt to explain observed cross country differences with the help of
some recent developments in the positive theory of fiscal policy.

17

111.1 Covernisent Borrowingw From the Monetary System and Fiscal Deficits;
The Evidence
Tables 7 and 8 contain alternative indicators of fiscal policy for our

sample of 52 countries. Table 7A contains two measures of the size of budget
deficits: the public sector borrowing from the domestic monetary system, and
the fiscal deficits of the central government, both as percentages of CDP.

Both variables are imperfect measures of the true budget deficit, but for

different reasons. The first variable is quite reliable, since the quality
of the data on each country's monetary survey is relatively good, and it is

comparable across countries. However, it excludes borrowing by the government from private non-bank investors and from foreign creditors. The second
variable, on the other hand, includes all the borrowing done by the central

government, irrespective of who is the creditor. But the quality of the data
is much less reliable, and it is less directly comparable across countries
since the definition of what is included in the central government accounts
differs greatly across countries -- see, for example, World Development

Report

1988,

p. 47, and Blejer and Chu (1988).

Table lB displays the correlation coefficients between these two

alternative measures of budget deficit, for different time periods. They
are always positive and quite high at least over some time periods.

Most of the main conclusions obtained for the inflation tax are

applicable to both indicators in Table 7: we observe important differences
across countries and across time, as well as across countries within a

region. Moreover, there is a very clear relation between Table 1 and Table
7A, tending to support the long maintained hypothesis that budget deficits

are an important determinant of inflation. This suggestion is further
strengthened by the evidence reported in Table 8. This table contains data

18

on the proportion of the Central Bank's credit that goes to the (central)

government. These data are quite striking, showing that

in many

countries

(and mostly in Africa and Latin America) the government borrows in extremely
large proportions from the domestic monetary authorities.

111.2 Political Instability and Budget Deficits
In the previous section we argued that political instability and
disagreement between current and future political majorities can explain why
countries retain inefficient tax systems without attempting to reform them.
The reason, we argued, is that political instability can lead to a form of

collective myopia. This same intuitive reason has been applied in a number
of recent papers by Tabellini and Alesina (1990), Alesina and Tabellini
(1989, 1990), and Persson and Svensson (1989), in attempt to explain the
occurrence of budget deficits.
Consider a policymaker (or a political majority) who must choose how

much to spend and tax

in

the current period, and what to spend on or whom to

tax. When making a policy decision, this policymaker chooses both the
intertemporal profile of spending and taxes as well as how to allocate the

resources acquired by issuing debt (or lost through a surplus). Suppose
that this policymaker is aware that in the future he may be replaced by a
policymaker (or majority) with different preferences about some aspects of

fiscal policy. Then he realizes that, whereas he is in control of how to
allocate the proceeds of his borrowing, the allocation of the burden of

repaying the debt in the future may not be under his control. This
asymmetry may prevent today's policymaker from fully internalizing the costs
of running a deficit, the more so the greater is the difference between his

preferences and the expected preferences of the future majority. In simple
terms, the policymaker may wish to borrow in excess of the optimum, and let

19

his successors pay the billa.

Thus, political instability and

polarization lead to a form of collective myopia, even if the policyiiaker
and the voters are rational and forward looking.

Alesina and Tabellini (1989) in particular focus on developing

countries. They consider an economy with two

groups

of agents identified by

their productive role: the workers (wage earners) and the capita1istsM
(owners of physical capital and profit earners). The two groups have their

political representatives (parties) that altern.ate
party, when in office, attempts to redistribute income in
own

in office. Each
favor of its

constituency. With political uncertainty (i.e., with uncertainty about the
identity of future governments), the government in office finds it optimal

to issue debt. This occurs because the current government does not fully
internalize the future costs of servicing the debt. The government that
borrows (say the capitalist one) also controls how the proceeds of the debt

issue are allocated: they are transferred to the capitalist constituency.
If there is a change of government, however, the debt will be repaid by the

opponent, by reducing the transfers to the workers constituency. Since
these costs are not internalized, the capitalist government overborrows.

Alesina and Tabellini (1990), in a more general setting, show that this
result extends to the case in which current and future governments disagree
about the composition of spending (rather than the distribution of income).

They show that these results go through even if the policies are chosen
directly by the voters (rather than by the party in office), provided that
current majorities are uncertain about the identity and preferences of
future majorities.

This general idea, that political alternation induces the government to
choose strategically the time path of a state variable, has several other

20

applications yet to be investigated (such as

to

the choice of capital versus

current public spending, or the choice of investment in legal and social

infrastructures). Moreover, the existing theoretical research on this subj ect has very sharp testable implications. We now ask whether the evidence
for the developing nations is consistent with these implications.
Tables 9A(i,ii), 9B(i,ii). 1OA and lOB report several alternative
regressions of budget deficits against different measures of political

instability. The method of estimation is Seemingly Unrelated Regressions
(SUR)

on

two

systems

of equations (each system being made up of the same

variables measured at different points in time). The dependent variables are
the two measures of budget deficit reported in Table 7A. The explanatory
variables, on the other hand, are:

(1) indicators of the structure of the

economy and (2) alternative measures of political instability. The
structural variables are the same as the ones used to compare the structure

of taxation in the previous section: per capita income; the share of
agriculture in total output; the share of exports plus imports in total
output; and the degree of urbanization (averaged over the relevant time

periods). Several alternative variables were used as measures of political
instability: Table 9A uses the actual frequency of government change (lumping together coups and regular government transfers); while in Table 9A(i) we
include the structural variables and in Table 9A(ii) we only included the

political instability measure. Tables 9B(i and ii) distinguish between the
frequency of coups and of regular government transfers. Presumably, coups
are associated with more radical changes in the nature and ideological
preferences of the government; if so, according to the theory summarized
above, the frequency of coups ought to have a stronger positive impact on the

budget deficit. In tables bA and lOB we dropped all the variables relating

21

to the structure of the economy except for the urbanization variable.
We see from these tables that our measure of political instability is,

in general, positively related to budget deficits: its estimated
coefficient is almost always positive, and it is significant for a large

number of regressions. As expected, coups and regular government changes
have different coefficients, and as expected coups generally have a bigger
and more significant estimated coefficient.
To assess the robustness of these estimates we added a set of dummy
variables that grouped countries into different geographical regions: Asia,

Africa and Latin America. These dummy variables were generally insignificant and the remaining coefficients were not affected. Finally, we also
tried other measures of political instability, constructed along the lines

of CET (1989). The results obtained were very similar to those reported in
Tables 9 and 10. Finally, the same results are obtained if each equation is
estimated separately by OLS, rather than by SUR.
We infer from these results that indeed more politically unstable

countries have tended to have larger budget deficits. In principle, one
could argue that budget deficits lead to instability, rather than vice

versa. But this is unlikely to be the case. Instability is a deep-rooted
feature of a political system, that generally reflects institutional and
sociological factors, and is generally not affected by the economic

performance of a government. Moreover, the same results reported in Tables
9 and 10 hold when we measure political instability as the frequency of
government change from 1950 up to the end of each of the periods reported in
Tables 9 and 10 (rather than just the frequency of government change in each

of those time intervals))6

22

On the other hand, the results of Tables 9 and 10 leave room for
improvements. First, as

already

mentioned, our indicators of budget deficit

contain measurement error. Second, we probably have omitted some relevant
economic variables that may influence a country decision of how much to

borrow. Finally, we do not have reliable measures of political polarization; and yet, according to the theory, political instability matters more

in more polarized countries. The results reported above suggest that trying
to solve these problems may indeed shed light on the fiscal behavior of many
developing countries.

IV. Concluding Remarks
There are very large differences in the monetary and fiscal policies
implemented by different countries or in the same country at different

points in time. How can these differences be explained? In the previous
pages we argued that this is one of the central questions to be addressed by

the theory of economic policy. We have suggested that an answer can be
found by focusing on the incentive constraints faced by the policymakers.
In particular, we emphasized credibility constraints and various political

incentives. Our empirical findings are very supportive of this line of
research. In our sample of developing countries, inflation and budget
deficits are systematically related to political variables, and in
particular to different measures of political instability.
The theoretical models reviewed and formulated in this paper offer at
least two different hypotheses of how political instability and more
generally political institutions influence the policy formation process.

First, political instability and polarization determines the strength of
reputational incentives, and hence ultimately the government credibility.

23

Second, political instability determines the rate of time preference of
society as

a

whole, and hence matters

for

any collective intertemporal

decision. ut there is a third possible hypothesis, suggested by the recent
work of Alesina-Drazen (1989) and Aizerunan (1990): political institutions
and in particular the degree of political cohesion influences a society's
capacity to make decisions and to change the status quo in the face of
adverse economic circumstances.
Presumably all three hypotheses contain important elements of truth.

Yet, discriminating among them, and assessing their relative importance in

concrete instances is one of the main tasks for future research. For only
then can the positive theory of economic policy lead to normative suggest.
ions for institutional reforms that would redirect the policymakers
incentives and allow better policies to be implemented.

inflation tax.

7Crilli also extends Mankiw's work by allowing the possibility of a
variable velocity and by explicitly incorporating the fact that fixed
exchange rate agreements constrain the ability to use seignorage.

8These tests are done on annual data. See Table 4 for the length of each
time series. The taxation rate is computed, as in Mankiw, as the ratio of

27

government

tax revenues to GDP. The raw data were obtained from the IMF

Government Financial Statistics.
9Unfortunately, there are no qu.arterly data for government revenues.

Naturally, the quarterly data contain additional information over the annual

data only if the government decision interval is a quarter. For monetary
policy, this is likely to be the case.

ATAX. When the change in the nominal

rate was used instead of INF the coefficient of TAX was much

closer to unity.

1nstrumental variables

estimation was used in order to account for

possible endogeneity of the TAX variable as a result of the Tanzi-Olivera
effect.

12For example, there may be serious measurement problems; alternatively
we may be facing a two way causality problem stemming from the presence of a

Tanzi type effect where inflation reduces the effective tax rate. However,
the fact that the optimal taxation hypothesis fails for countries with very
low average inflation suggests that the Tan.zi effect is not very important

in driving these results. Also, the instrumental variables estimation was

undertaken in order to eliminate this endogeneity problem. In developing
more complicated versions of this Dodd a number of institutional characteristics proper of the LDCs should be considered. For example, one ought to
take into account the fact that often domestic capital markets are not well

developed. Hence most public borrowing has to be done abroad, using
external debt. This introduces two complications that may change the nature
of the optimal policy. First, developing countries generally face credit
constraints in international capital markets. Secondly, to the extent that

28

they can borrow abroad, they can only borrow in foreign currency; this means
that external debt may increase exposure to exchange rate risk or terms of

trade risk. Both of these complications presumably weaken the tax smoothing
principle, since they raise the cost of issuing public debt. However, they
do not alter the prescription that the inflation rate should covary
positively with other tax rates.

'31n a recent paper David Romer (1989) has proposed an alternative
procedure for testing whether the absence of commitment matters in monetary

policy. His main proposition is that in the absence of commitment, there
will be an inverse relationship between inflation and openness. The reason
for this, Romer argues, is that engaging in surprise monetary expansions --

as a government will tend to do in the absence of commitment --

will

generate an exchange rate depreciation. To the extent that the cost of
depreciation increases with openness, more open countries will, in the

absence of commitment, tend to have lower inflation. Using a sample of 57
countries (both industrialized as well as LDCs) Romer finds some empirical

support for his model. Indeed when only developing nations are considered,
he obtains coefficients for openness that range from -1.237 to -2.417, and

are always significant. Although Romer's work constitutes an early attempt
at empirically testing the credibility hypothesis, and his results are

somewhat suggestive, his analysis is not free of problems. Perhaps the most
important limitation of this study is the contention that expansive monetary

surprises will generate a depreciation. This is only valid in the context
of freely fluctuating nominal exchange rate regimes. If, on the other hand,
the country in question has a predetermined nominal exchange rate system - as most LDCs do - -

surprise

monetary expansions will generally tend to

result in no change in the nominal exchange rate and in a real exchange rate

29

appreciation, rather than depreciation.
14A11 variables are measured as averages for 1971 - 1982.

Seigniorage is

the change of higi powered money as a percentage of government tax revenue

plus increase in high powered money. Openness is measured as imports plus
exports over GDP. Notice that this equation excludes the mining and
manufacturing shares. Including them results in an insignificant coefficient, with the expected sign, with no other changes in the regression.

'5urbanization has a positive rather than negative coefficient. This
however is consistent with the view that political polarization matters:
political disagreement is generally considered by political scientists to be
more acute in urban areas.
