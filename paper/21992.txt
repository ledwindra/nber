Who Benefits from Calorie Labeling? An Analysis of its Effects on Body Mass
Partha Deb and Carmen Vargas
NBER Working Paper No. 21992
February 2016
JEL No. I12,I18
ABSTRACT
This study uses county-level variation in implementation of calorie labeling laws in the US to identify
the effects of such laws on body mass. Using the 2003 to 2012 waves of the Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System, we find a statistically insignificant average treatment effect for women and a
small, statistically significant and negative average treatment effect for men, indicating a decrease
in BMI after implementation of calorie-labeling laws. We estimate finite mixture models and discover
that the average treatment effects mask substantial heterogeneity in the effects across three classes
of women and men. For both women and men, the three classes, determined within the model, can
be described as a subpopulation with normal weight, a second one that is overweight on average and
a third one that is obese on average. Estimates from finite mixture models show that the effect is largely
concentrated among a class of women with BMI distributions centered on overweight. The effects
for men are statistically significant for each of the three classes and large for men in the overweight
and obese classes. These results suggest that overweight and obese individuals are especially sensitive
to relevant information.

Introduction

Obesity is a prevalent public health problem. From the perspective of the individual, there
are some effective medical treatments and lifestyle change interventions have been shown to
work in some sub-populations but not generally. Therefore, solutions to the health problem
remain elusive. A secular increase in total calorie consumption over time is the more likely
explanation for the increase in obesity rather than a decrease in calories expended (Bleich et
al., 2008; Cutler et al., 2003). Decreases in prices of calorie-dense foods relative to prices of
less-dense, more nutritious foods (Christian and Rashad, 2009) are one plausible explanation
for the increase in calorie consumption. Consumption of food prepared away from home has
also increased dramatically over time. The share of daily calories consumed coming from
restaurants and fast food establishments has increased from 6% to 20% between 1977-78
and 2007-08 (Lin and Guthrie, 2012). Such food often is typically calorie-dense along with
being of poor nutritional value (Anderson and Matsa, 2011; Currie et al., 2010). Therefore,
such consumption is often cited as a cause of increased body weight in the US.
Consumers often do not know the caloric and nutrient value of foods (see Section 6.1 in
Cawley (2015) for a review of the literature). Not only do consumers generally underestimate the number of calories, but also evidence suggests that the downward bias is positively
related to the actual number of calories in the item (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation,
2009). While the provision of nutrition information on packaged foods has been mandated
by the federal government since the passing of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of
1990, restaurants were exempted from this requirement. As a response, some cities, counties
and states have passed laws beginning in 2008 that mandate posting of nutrition information (typically calorie counts but also, in some cases, nutrient information) on menus and
menu boards. New York City implemented mandatory calorie labeling in July 2008 and
other states, counties and cities in the Northeastern and Western regions of the US have
followed suit.
In this paper, we examine the effect of calorie labeling on body mass. While the imperfect
information arguments made above and in references therein suggest that consumers should
respond to calorie information posted on menus in restaurants, whether and by how much
consumers actually respond remains an empirical question. We use the 2003 to 2012 waves
of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and a difference-in-difference
empirical strategy exploiting variation in implementation of calorie labeling laws across
1

counties in the United States over time in our analysis. We estimate models separately for
men and women, and for each gender, focus on heterogeneous treatment effects which we
elicit using finite mixture models. As Cawley (2015, section 7.7) explains, discovering and
explaining heterogeneity of effects is an important research frontier.
Empirical evidence on the effects of calorie labeling is mixed (Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation, 2009). A number of studies have examined behavior at the point of purchase.
Bassett et al. (2008) examined purchasing behavior at Subway restaurants that voluntarily posted calorie information and found that individuals who noticed the information
purchased fewer calories than those who did not. Wisdom et al. (2010) used a similar
study design and found that disclosing calorie information at a fast food chain restaurant
led to consumers ordering fewer sandwiches with fewer calories. Elbel et al. (2009) used
a difference-in-difference design comparing treated and untreated chain restaurants before
and after implementation of the New York City Law and found that calorie labeling had
no impact on consumption. Dumanovksy et al. (2011) employed a similar study design
and reached a similar conclusion overall. Bollinger et al. (2011) used transactions data
from Starbucks and found that calorie labeling did result in fewer calories consumed per
transaction. They also found that calorie labeling had larger effects for women and a priori
high-calorie purchasers. Restrepo (2014) examines effects of mandated calorie labeling in
a number of New York counties between 2004 and 2012. Restrepo uses a difference-indifference design and data from the BRFSS to examine the effects of calorie labeling on the
body mass index (BMI). He finds robust evidence of significant decreases in BMI due to
calorie labeling. He estimates quantile regressions to show that the effects of calorie labeling
are generally larger in the upper quantiles of the BMI distribution.
Our study expands the sample from New York to a substantial portion of the US.
While Restrepo (2014) compares a few counties in New York with calorie labeling to those
without, we compare a number of counties, cities and states in the US with calorie labeling laws implemented to neighboring geographies without calorie labeling. We conduct a
detailed examination of heterogeneous treatment effects using finite mixture models. We
expect heterogeneous treatment effects because calorie labeling and posting requirements
vary across jurisdictions, because only a fraction of the population may observe calorie labels; and because individuals may substitute calories across restaurant and non-restaurant
meals. Dumanovsky et al. (2011) found heterogeneity across genders and Restrepo (2014)

2

along the distribution of BMI. Our analysis encompasses both those possibilities and allows
for more.
We estimate finite mixture models (Mclachlan and Peel, 2000; Deb and Trivedi, 1997) to
explore the possibility of such heterogeneity, to estimate heterogeneous effects of migration
and to characterize the sources of such unobserved heterogeneity. Finite Mixture Models
have received increasing attention in the statistics literature mainly because of the number
of areas in which such distributions are encountered (see McLachlan andPeel, 2000; Lindsay,
1995). Econometric applications of finite mixture models include the seminal work of Heckman and Singer (1984) to labor economics, Wedel et al.(1993) to marketing data, El-Gamal
and Grether(1995) to data from experiments in decision-making under uncertainty, Deb and
Trivedi(1997) to the economics of health care. More recent applications include Ayyagari,
et al. (2013) and Deb, et al. (2011) in studies of BMI and alcohol consumption, Bruhin, et
al. (2010) to experimental data and Caudill et al (2009) and Günther and Launov (2012)
to issues in economic development.
In difference-in-difference regression analysis, identification of causal effects relies heavily
on the assumption of identical pre-program trends. Consequently, it can be useful to weight
/ reweight the sample such that the covariate distribution of the control group becomes more
similar to the covariate distribution in the treatment group (Abadie and Imbens, 2011).
In addition, following the principles of synthetic control groups proposed by Abadie and
Gardeazabal (2003) and Abadie, et al. (2010), one can reweight the sample based on pretrend values of the outcome itself to have identical (not just parallel) pre-treatment trends
in BMI. In this paper, we use a novel technique called entropy balancing (Hainmueller,
2011) to estimate weights to perfectly balance covariates and pre-treatment BMI trends.
We find that the average treatment effect is not significantly different from zero for the
sample of women but it is negative and statistically significant for the sample of men. These
average treatment effects mask substantial heterogeneity in the effects for women and men.
The finite mixture models uncover three classes of BMI for women and men: the first is a
subpopulation with normal weight, a second subpopulation that is overweight on average
and a third one that is morbidly obese on average. There is a statistically significant effect
for women in the overweight class while the treatment effects are not significant in the other
BMI classes. For men, the effect is statistically significant in each of the three classes but
increases substantially in magnitude across normal weight, overweight and obese classes.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces our empirical
strategy and the econometric model and section 3 presents the data. Section 4 discusses
the empirical results and provides some interpretations. We wrap up with conclusions in
section 5.

Empirical strategy and econometric model

2.1

Difference-in-difference specification

Consider a design in which there is a binary treatment indicator Gi (with Gi = 1 denoting
the treatment group), a binary time indicator Ti (with Ti = 1 denoting the intervention
period) and Xi denoting a set of control covariates. Then, using the potential outcomes
framework, the treatment effect in a difference-in-difference model (Athey and Imbens,
2006) can be written as
τ = E[y1 1 |Ti = 1, Gi = 1, Xi ] − E[yi 0 |Ti = 1, Gi = 1, Xi ],

(1)

where yi 1 and yi 0 denote the potential outcomes with and without treatment respectively.
As usual, in the potential outcomes framework, the observed outcome Y is given by
yi = 1[Ti = 1, Gi = 1] × yi 1 + (1 − 1[Ti = 1, Gi = 1]) × yi 0
= Ti × Gi × yi 1 + (1 − Ti × Gi ) × yi 0

(2)
(3)

where 1 denotes the indicator function.
In the context of a linear regression model with group and time indicators along with a
group-time interaction,
yi = β1 Ti + β2 Gi + β3 Ti Gi + Xi θ + εi .

(4)

the two expected potential outcomes can be written as
E[yi 0 |Ti = 1, Gi = 1, Xi ] = β1 + β2 + Xi θ

(5)

E[yi 1 |Ti , Gi , Xi ] = β1 Ti + β2 Gi + β3 Ti Gi + Xi θ

(6)

and

so that the treatment effect τ = β3 is the coefficient on the interaction term in the regression
specification. We estimate this basic specification using weighted least squares, where the
4

weights incorporate both survey weights and covariate balance adjustments as described in
detail below.
The outcome of interest in our analysis is BMI. Individuals who live in counties with
calorie labeling laws implemented are assigned to the treated group while those in counties
without implemented calorie labeling laws are assigned to the comparison group. Control
covariates include demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and indicators for states
and years. Inference is based on standard errors adjusted for clustering at the county level.

2.2

Entropy balance weights

In difference-in-difference regression analysis, identification of causal effects relies heavily on
the assumption that pre-program trends of the outcome are identical. In order to achieve
balance between treated and control observations, it can be useful to weight / reweight the
sample such that the covariate distribution of the control group becomes more similar to
the covariate distribution in the treatment group (Abadie and Imbens, 2011). In addition,
we include the mean value of the outcome (BMI) for each pre-treatment year of data by
county and gender in the set of “covariates” used in the entropy balancing algorithm. Thus,
following the principles of synthetic control groups proposed by Abadie and Gardeazabal
(2003) and Abadie, et al. (2010), not only are the treated and control samples balanced on
covariates, they are also balanced on the values of the county-level average outcome in each
year of the pre-treatment period.
We use a novel method for generating weights to create balance: entropy balancing. Entropy balancing, a method developed by Hainmueller (2011), produces a set of observationlevel weights that directly balances covariate distributions across treated and control groups.
Inverse propensity score weighting is the popular method for this purpose (Ho, Imai, King,
and Stuart, 2007) but the entropy balance method has a number of practical advantages.
First, it eliminates the need to back and forth between propensity score specification, estimation and balance checking. Second, propensity score weights can lead to worse balance
on some covariate dimensions while improving balance on others (Iacus, King, and Porro,
2012). Third, while the weights are adjusted as far as is needed to accommodate the balance
constraints, at the same time they are kept as close as possible to the base weights to retain
information in the reweighted data, so extreme weights are much less likely.
In the propensity score weighting method, every treated unit gets a weight di = 1 and

5

every control unit gets a weight equal to di =

pb(xi )
1−b
p(xi )

where pb(xi ) is the estimated propensity

score. In the entropy balancing method, each treated unit gets either a weight wi = 1 or
wi = si , where si is the sampling weight associated with the treated observations, and
every control unit gets a weight that satisfies a set of a priori specified balance constraints.
Specifically, wi for the control units are chosen by the solution to
min H(w) =
wi

X

wi log(wi /si )

(7)

subject to
X

wi cri (xi ) = kr with r ∈ 1, ..., R

i|D=0

X

wi = 1

i|D=0

wi ≥ 0 for all i such that D = 0
where cri (Xi) = mr describes a set of R balance constraints imposed on the covariate
moments of the reweighted control group. Each balance constraint equates the weighted
mean of the covariate in the treated sample to the weighted mean of the covariate in the
control sample. In the case of indicator variables, which comprise most of the covariates in
the study, equality of means is equivalent to equality of distributions. We conduct entropy
balance for each gender and year of data separately, so covariate balance is obtained within
each gender-year subsample.
We apply the entropy balance algorithm iteratively. In the first application of the
algorithm, we set the weights for the treated group to their sampling weights and have one
balance constraint for each covariate used in the regression analysis. We use the resulting
balance weights to calculate county-level means of BMI by gender and pre-treatment years.
The second application of the entropy balance algorithm adds county-mean BMI (in addition
to the regression covariates) into the set of balance constraints. This generates a new set of
balance-weights, which we use to recalculate county-level mean BMI for the pre-treatment
years. The third application of the entropy balance algorithm uses, once again, balance
constraints for covariates and county-level mean BMI. The revised balance weights have a
correlation of 0.99 with the weights from the prior iteration so we consider the process to
have converged to a stable set of balance weights.

2.3

Finite mixture model

Most empirical models for estimating treatment effects assume that the effect is constant
across the population, or can be interpreted as estimating average effects. Yet there are
many reasons for expecting that treatment effects are not constant, or that the average of
effects masks substantive and policy relevant heterogeneity. In most large experiments or
quasi-experimental designs, there are many opportunities for the actual treatment to be heterogeneous across individual characteristics, household characteristics, sites or geographies,
for the intensity of treatment to vary, and for compliance to and effects of treatment to
vary by individual or group characteristics. Heterogeneity in each of these dimensions lead
to heterogeneity of treatment effects. In this analysis, we expect heterogeneous treatment
effects because, for example, calorie labeling and posting requirements vary across jurisdictions, because only a fraction of the population may observe calorie labels; and because
individuals may substitute calories across restaurant and non-restaurant meals.
Heterogeneity of treatment effects is typically explored via the use of interaction terms in
regression analyses or by stratifying the sample by indicators of the source of heterogeneity.
For example, stratified analyses by race or gender are commonplace. However, there are
data and statistical limits to the amount of stratification that can be done given a sample,
and such analyses increase the risk of false findings. Furthermore, often heterogeneity exists
along the distribution of the outcome itself, by complex configurations of observed characteristics, or on unobserved characteristics. Quantile regressions are an appealing technique
to explore heterogeneity along the outcome distribution but does not provide insight into
the other dimensions of heterogeneity. Finite mixture models can identify heterogeneous
treatment effects, if they exist, and characterize that heterogeneity along dimensions of the
outcome distribution, observed characteristics and unobserved characteristics.
The density function for a C-component finite mixture (Deb and Trivedi, 1997; Deb, et
al., 2011; McLachlan and Peel, 2000), is
f (y|x; θ1 , θ2 , ..., θC ; π1 , π2 , ..., πC ) =

C
X

πj fj (y|x; θj )

(8)

j=1

where 0 < πj < 1, and

PC

j=1 πj

= 1 and fj denotes an appropriate density given the char-

acteristics of the error terms. As we will describe below, normally (Gaussian) distributed
components appear to be appropriate in the context of the outcome of interest. We estimate

7

the parameters of this model using maximum likelihood. Inference is based on standard
errors adjusted for clustering at the county level.
Examination of the parameter estimates provides information on whether there is substantial heterogeneity across the distribution of the outcome and the treatment effects for
each subpopulation. Although the parameter estimates, per se, do not characterize the
component distributions, one can use Bayes Theorem in a process to classify individual
observations into the components identified by the model estimates. More precisely, post
estimation, we use Bayes Theorm to calculate the posterior probability that observation yi
belongs to component c (the prior probability is assumed to be a constant):
πc fc (yi |xi , θc )
,
Pr[yi ∈ classc|xi , yi; θ] = PC
j=1 πj fj (yi |xi , θj )

c = 1, 2, ..C.

(9)

Next, we assign an observation i into class j such that j = arg maxc Pr[yi ∈ class c|xi , yi; θ].
Then we treat the classification as known and stratify the sample by latent class in subsequent descriptive analysis of the relationship between observed covariates and class membership. This provides a characterization of the observations in each class.

3

Data and descriptive statistics

We use data from the 2003–2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).1 The
BRFSS is an annual, nationally representative survey of adults aged 18 and over conducted
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in collaboration with state health departments. The survey contains information on self-reported height and weight and extensive
demographic and health-related information. Preliminary analyses suggested substantial
heterogeneity by gender so we proceed by stratifying our analysis by gender throughout.
We also restrict our sample to individuals 21 to 75 years old. We eliminate individuals
over 75 years old because, in older adults, decreases in fat-free mass, increases in fat mass
and loss of height alter the trajectory of BMI substantially (Villareal, et al. 2005). BRFSS
reports some implausibly small and large BMI values. To remove these outliers or possibly
erroneous values of BMI, we drop observations with the highest and lowest half percent of
BMI values separately for women and men. BRFSS also has a small number of extremely
low and high sampling weights, which become especially troublesome after entropy balance
1

Unfortunately, for 2013 and going forward, the public-use BRFSS files do not contain county identifiers.

8

reweighting. Thus we drop observations with the smallest and largest quarter percent of
sampling weights.
We use the Area Resource File (ARF) to classify each county of residence in each year by
population and income. We drop all rural counties and small urban areas with populations
less than 20,000. The remaining counties are classified as being urban (population greater
than 20,000), small metropolitan areas (population less than 250,000), metropolitan areas
(population between 250,000 and 1,000,000) and large metropolitan areas with populations
greater than 1,000,000. We also control for household median income in each county. In
addition, we use the County Business Patterns (CBP) data to measure the size of the
limited service restaurant (LSR) sector – the primary target of the calorie labeling laws. To
be specific, we measure the size of the limited restaurant sector by the number of employees
in such establishments per 1,000 population in each county.
We obtained and cross-referenced county-specific information on legislation and implementation of calorie labeling laws from the National Conference of State Legislatures, the
Center for Science in the Public Interest and MenuCalc, a web-based online nutrition analysis platform for the food industry endorsed by the National Restaurant Association. Table
1 shows the counties and states that enforced calorie-labeling laws at some point during
the study period. Figures 1 and 2 show that geographies with calorie-labeling laws are
concentrated in the Northeastern and Western regions of the US. Therefore, we restrict our
analysis to states in those regions for both treatment and comparison observations. Thus,
in addition to displaying treated counties, figures 1 and 2 also show the comparison states
and counties in our study. The key variable in the analysis is an indicator labeled “County
has law enforced” that takes a value of one if a county has implemented mandatory calorie
labeling in the month and year of interview and zero otherwise. We pool the data from
Northeast and Western US counties and estimate the model.
Table 2 displays summary statistics for the samples of women and men separately and
stratified according to whether the observation is assigned to a county that has a calorielabeling law at any point during the sample period or not. Among women, there are 382,581
observations in counties without a law and 197,982 observations in counties with the law.
Among men, the corresponding samples sizes are 263,603 and 135,153 respectively.
The summary statistics in table 2 show that the average BMI in treated and comparison
counties are not substantially different for samples of women and men. In addition, treated

9

and comparison observations have similar average age and rates of blacks, college graduates,
middle income earners and pregnancy among women. On the other hand, treated observations are considerably more likely to be other minority, Hispanic and have low incomes and
less likely to be married and have high incomes.
Although our regression analyses take these characteristics into account, it is preferable to minimize reliance on the parametric form of the regression analysis by balancing
on covariates and mean BMI in pre-program years. This allows us to interpret the regression estimates as being doubly robust. As described above, we adjust the BRFSS sampling
weights using entropy minimization to obtain new sampling weights for comparison observations while retaining the original sampling weights for the treated observations. We
estimate the entropy-balance weights separately for each gender and each year of data.
Sample means using the entropy-balance weights are shown in table 3. Now the samples
are “perfectly” balanced. For example, 9.1 percent of Hispanic women lived in comparison
counties while 25.9 lived in treated counties in the “unadjusted” analysis shown in table 2.
After entropy-balancing, both treated and comparison counties have 25.9 percent Hispanic
observations. The mean number of LSR employees is higher in treated counties than control
counties when sampling weights are used in the calculations. Once entropy balance weights
are used, treated and control counties have identical LSR densities. All other characteristics
are similarly balanced.

Results

Figure 3 shows the trends in average BMI for treatment and control groups stratified by
gender. The graphs in the left panels display means weighted by the BRFSS sampling
weights. The graphs in the right panels display means weighted by entropy-balance weights.
For the sample of women, the sampling-weighted means are close but show some divergence
before calorie-labeling laws went into effect. For men, the sampling-weighted means are
appear roughly parallel but somewhat apart in the pre-law period, obscuring possible gains
of the calorie labeling laws. The use of entropy-balance weights brings the pre-treatment
trends together and enhances the differences in post-treatment outcomes. In both cases, a
widening of the BMI gap after 2008 is apparent.
2

Readers will observe that, for the sample of men, the trends converge sharply in 2012. It remains to be
seen if this is a real feature, an artifact of some remaining outliers, or due to changes in values of predictive
covariates.

10

Results of the difference-in-difference entropy-balance weighted regressions for the samples of women and men are shown in Table 4. The effect of the calorie-labeling laws is not
statistically significant for the sample of women. However, there is a significant decrease
in BMI of about 0.31 among men that can be attributed to the calorie-labeling laws. This
translates to about 1.1 percent of the average male BMI. Other coefficients in the regressions are generally significant and have expected signs. For example, BMI increases at a
decreasing rate with age, blacks and Hispanics have higher BMI but other minorities have
lower BMI. Education and income are both associated with lower BMI. Among county-level
characteristics, while county-level income has the expected negative effect on BMI for both
men and women, the density of LSR restaurants is not associated with BMI.

4.1

Finite mixture models

We estimate 2, 3, and 4 component finite mixture models and find that 3-component models
have the best fit for the samples of men and women. Thus we proceed by focussing on 3component models.
Table 5 and figure 4 show some basic characteristics of the three component densities
for the full samples of women and men. For the sample of women, the model identifies a
distribution centered on normal weight (mean BMI equals 22) with associated probability of
0.32, a distribution centered on overweight (mean BMI equals 27) with a probability of 0.48
and a relatively dispersed distribution centered on obese weight (mean BMI equals 34) with
a probability of 0.21. The distributional characteristics of the mixture classes for the sample
of men are broadly similar to those of women but have some substantive differences. The
model identifies a distribution centered just under the clinical cutoff for overweight (BMI of
25) with associated probability of 0.42, a distribution centered on overweight (mean BMI
equals 28) with a probability of 0.43 and a relatively dispersed distribution centered on
obese weight (mean BMI equals 34) with a probability of 0.16.
Table 6 reports the difference-in-difference regression coefficients for each latent class.
The results show that the reduction in BMI due to the calorie-labeling law is statistically
significant only in the second component, which corresponds to a class of women whose BMI
is centered on 27. The marginal effect of the law is 0.25, which corresponds to about 0.9
percent of the average BMI for this class of observations. The effects of the calorie-labeling
laws are very different for men (see table 6). Calorie-labeling laws have an effect on each of

11

the three classes. Men who belong to the borderline overweight class with a mean BMI of 25
and who are exposed to calorie-labeling laws decrease their BMI by a small, but statistically
significant 0.14 units. This corresponds to just under 0.6 percent of the mean BMI for that
class. Men in the overweight class, corresponding to the component distribution with a
mean of 28 and a occurrence probability of 0.43 decrease their BMI by 0.40 when exposed
to calorie-labeling laws. This effect corresponds to 1.4 percent of their average BMI. Men
in the obese class decrease their BMI when exposed to calorie-labeling laws by a large and
statistically significant 0.70 units – or 2 percent of the average BMI in the class.
For both women and men, there is an effect of calorie-labeling laws on a high weight
subpopulation, but men in the morbidly obese subpopulation also experience substantial
loss in BMI. These results are broadly consistent with Restrepo (2014) who finds a bigger
effect at the higher quantiles of BMI and Bollinger et al. (2011) who find a much higher
effect among individuals who already consume above average calories at Starbucks. The
estimates of the finite mixture models, however, uncover a subtle yet important difference,
which is that calorie-labeling has an affect on a substantial fraction of women who are
overweight but appears to have no effect on a smaller but significant fraction of women who
are, on average, obese. For men, it appears that the effect of calorie-labeling laws persists
through the entire distribution but with the effect being larger (in absolute and percentage
terms) in the overweight and obese classes.

4.2

Alternative specifications of the finite mixture models

Self-reported weight and BMI is fraught with measurement error. Cawley (2004) and
Burkhauser and Cawley (2008) show that the measurement error is non-classical because,
while individuals generally tend to underreport their weight, overweight individuals tend to
underreport their weight more. Consequently, in our first check of our main results, we follow Cawley (2004) and predict measured BMI in our BRFSS sample using coefficients from
a validation regression equation estimated using data from NHANES. To be precise, we use
data from the 2005-2006, 2007-2008, and 2009-2010 rounds of the NHANES to estimate a
regression of measured BMI on a quadratic function of reported BMI fully interacted with
a quadratic in age and indicators for gender, black and other race and Hispanic ethnicity.
We estimate a 3-class finite mixture model using the predicted, measured BMI and report
key estimates in the top panel of table 7. The results for both samples of women and

12

men are qualitatively unchanged. The point estimates for overweight and obese classes are
somewhat larger, however.
Our second check of the specification of the model concerns the use of entropy balance
weights. We have already shown that the use of these weights balances the treated and
control samples perfectly in terms of observed covariates. When we estimate the finite
mixture model using BRFSS sampling weights instead, the results, shown in the second
panel of table 7, are very similar for the sample of women. For the sample of men, the effect
for the lowest BMI class (borderline overweight) is no longer statistically significant, the
effect for the overweight class is a bit smaller and the effect for the obese class substantially
smaller than those obtained in the main specification.
BRFSS is a survey that has been conducted, until recently, exclusively via home (land
line) telephone interviews. From 2011 onwards, the BRFSS sampling frame changed to allow
for respondents on cellular phones, with just under 11 percent of interviews conducted on
cellular phones in 2011 and 17 percent such interviews in 2012. In a check of the estimates
to these, potentially different, individuals, we drop them from the sample and reestimate
the finite mixture model. The results, shown in the third panel, are qualitatively identical
and quantitatively very similar to our main results.
We generalize our difference-in-difference specification to include state-specific time
trends. We have estimated finite mixture models with linear and quadratic time-trend
specifications and report the results of the quadratic state-specific time trends specification
in the fourth panel of table 7. Qualitatively, the results are very similar to the main specification. The point estimates for the overweight and obese latent classes are larger, especially
for the sample of men. The results of the model specified with linear trends has the same
characteristics.
In our final check of specification, we include the county mean BMI in 2003 as an
additional regressor in the model. This is an atypical difference-in-difference specification
but has the flavor of a panel-data regression with an initial condition (Wooldridge, 2005).
The estimates, shown in the bottom panel, are qualitatively and quantitatively virtually
identical to those obtained in our main specification.

Characterizing the latent classes

Estimates of the parameters of the finite mixture models reveal that the effects of calorielabeling laws are heterogeneous and substantially affect overweight women and men, and,
in addition, obese men. Nevertheless, calorie-labeling laws appear to have no effect on
substantial portions of the population of women and only a small effect on a substantial
portion of men. In order to determine whether there are observable characteristics (other
than BMI) that might distinguish the classes of individuals, we classify the female and male
samples separately using the posterior probabilities of class membership (equation 9). We
use this posterior classification to summarize the observed characteristics, using the entropy
balance weights, of the samples by latent class. Differences in the standardized distributions
of the characteristics are displayed in radar plots for the samples of women and men.
Radar plots of means of standardized covariates are shown in figure 5. For the samples
of women and men, those in the latent class centered around overweight are likely to be
older, high school graduates only, and Hispanic. Note that this is the class of observations
with the consistently significant effect across samples and specifications. Women and men
in the normal weight class, for whom there are generally statistically insignificant and/or
small effects, are likely to be high income and college graduates, live in high income counties
and more likely to be married. Finally, while there are no differences in the size of county
that women live in on the basis of the BMI classes, men who belong to the obese class are
more likely to live in small urban counties while men in the normal weight class are more
likely to live in large metropolitan areas. There are virtually no differences in the states of
residence of individuals in each of the three latent classes (not shown in the figures).

Conclusion

The results in this study indicate that mandatory calorie labeling laws implemented over
the past few years in a number of states and counties appear to be having substantial effects
in terms of decreased BMI following implementation of such laws. Estimates from finite
mixture models show that the effect is largely concentrated among a class of women with
BMI distributions centered on overweight. The effects for men are statistically significant
for each of the three classes and large for men in the overweight and obese classes.
There are two likely explanations for why the largest effects of the calorie labeling laws

14

are found for overweight women and overweight and obese men. First, if one assumes
that the information asymmetry is constant across the population, calorie labeling laws
may have largest impacts for the overweight and obese because they are most sensitive
to the information. Calorie labeling laws have very small impacts among individuals who
are normal weight because they have no reason to change their behavior on the basis of
the new information. Second, it is possible that, while individuals in the overweight and
obese classes are unaware of the caloric content of restaurant meals, individuals in the
normal weight class are more aware of the caloric content. These results run counter to
the argument that individuals who consume the most calories (more likely to be overweight
or obese) are least likely to change their consumption behavior. In addition, if such high
consumption individuals are, in fact, information sensitive, they may well also be price
sensitive and sensitive to behavioral prompts.
Our analysis of the observed correlates of class membership shows that women and men
in the overweight class are likely to be older, high school graduates only, and Hispanic. We
speculate that such individuals might be either most uninformed or most likely to react
to new information. Women and men in the normal weight class, for whom there are
generally statistically insignificant and/or small effects, are likely to be high income and
college graduates, live in high income counties and more likely to be married. Perhaps this
justifies the emphasis of most calorie labeling laws on meals in limited service restaurants.
Information provision at higher-priced, full service restaurants, frequented by individuals of
higher socioeconomic status, may not have substantial new information content for those
individuals.
