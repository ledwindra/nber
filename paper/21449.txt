Hedge Funds: A Dynamic Industry In Transition

NBER Working Paper No. 21449
August 2015
JEL No. G01,G11,G12,G20,G23,G24
ABSTRACT
The hedge-fund industry has grown rapidly over the past two decades, offering investors unique investment
opportunities that often reflect more complex risk exposures than those of traditional investments.
In this article we present a selective review of the recent academic literature on hedge funds as well
as updated empirical results for this industry. Our review is written from several distinct perspectives:
the investor's, the portfolio manager's, the regulator's, and the academic's. Each of these perspectives
offers a different set of insights into the financial system, and the combination provides surprisingly
rich implications for the Efficient Markets Hypothesis, investment management, systemic risk, financial
regulation, and other aspects of financial theory and practice.

Net-of-fee returns for a hypothetical fund of funds charging a 1% fixed fee and
a 10% incentive fee and investing an equal amount of capital in two funds, A
and B, with both funds charging a 2% fixed fee and a 20% incentive fee, for
various realized annual gross-of-fee returns for A and B. Net-of-fee returns are
reported as a percent of assets under management (top panel). The bottom
panel reports fees as a percentage of net profits of the total gross investment
returns generated by A and B. No high-water mark or clawback provisions
are assumed. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Introduction

The growth of the hedge-fund industry over the past two decades has been nothing short
of miraculous. In 1990, hedge funds managed approximately $39 billion in assets, and despite several industry-wide crises—including the Asian Contagion (1997), Long-Term Capital
Management (1998), the bursting of the Tech Bubble (2001–2002), the subprime mortgage
crisis (2006–2008), and the ongoing European debt crisis—current estimates put hedge-fund
assets at $2.5 trillion. This astonishing rate of growth is not accidental. It reflects a broad
and abiding demand for what hedge funds offer: higher risk-adjusted expected returns;
greater diversification across assets, markets, and styles; and fewer constraints on portfolio
managers who are incentivized to generate unique sources of excess expected returns, i.e.,
“alpha”.
However, along with these advantages, hedge funds also offer more complex risk exposures that vary according to style and market circumstances— risks such as “tail events”,
illiquidity, and valuation uncertainty. Also, because hedge funds enjoy greater latitude in
their investment mandate and typically provide little transparency to their investors because
of the proprietary nature of their strategies, the possibility of fraud and operational risks
is of much greater concern to their investors. If typical hedge-fund investors are considered
“hot money”, there may be good reason.
These conflicting characteristics may explain why investors have a love/hate relationship
with alternative investments. According to HFR (2013), in 2013Q4 63% of funds of funds
experienced fund outflows; however, only 45% of single-fund manager funds did. This is
consistent with the general decline in the number of funds of funds, which is attributable to
their fees, competition from multi-strategy funds, and their general inability to avoid losses
during the recent financial crisis. Relative Value, Equity Hedge, and Event-Driven categories
each encompass about 27% of the total hedge fund assets under management. The rest
(about 19%) is invested with Global Macro funds. This situation changed dramatically from
1990Q4 when 40% was invested with Global Macro funds, and Event-Driven comprised only
10% of total hedge fund assets. About half (47%) of all hedge funds never reach their fifth
anniversary. However, 40% of funds survive for 7 years or longer.
It is now apparent that hedge funds are not simply a fad that will disappear. The industry
has matured considerably over the past two decades and now serves critical functions in
the global financial system such as liquidity provision, risk transfer, price discovery, credit,
and insurance. For all these reasons, a critical survey of the hedge-fund literature seems
worthwhile and is undertaken in this article. In addition to providing a review of recent
academic studies on hedge funds, we report updated empirical results on their performance
1

and risk characteristics. Given how quickly the industry changes, hedge-fund data from 10
years ago may no longer be representative of today’s reality, especially in the aftermath of
the Financial Crisis of 2007–2009.
In preparing our review, we considered four distinct perspectives on the hedge-fund industry. The investor’s perspective is most concerned with the risk/reward profile that hedgefund strategies offer and how they compare to more traditional investment vehicles. The
manager’s perspective is focused on generating profitable trading strategies while managing
the risks of the investments as well as the business. The regulator’s perspective involves the
degree to which hedge-fund blowups may spill over to the rest of the financial system and
harm the real economy. And the academic’s perspective consists of the many implications of
hedge-fund profitability for the Efficient Markets Hypothesis, passive investing, linear factor
models, and the traditional quantitative investment paradigm. Rather than choosing just
one of these perspectives, we hope to broaden the usefulness of this survey by attempting to
cover all four to some degree.
We begin by summarizing the basic characteristics of hedge funds in Section 2, and
then review the various sources of hedge-fund data—a pre-requisite for any serious study of
the industry—in Section 3. We then provide an overview of basic investment performance
statistics for hedge funds in Section 4. One of the most important factors driving hedge-fund
performance is illiquidity, hence we focus squarely on this issue in Section 5. Of course, hedge
funds exhibit many sources of risk beyond illiquidity, and in Section 6 we explore these risks
and corresponding linear and nonlinear factor models to measure and manage such risks. No
survey of hedge funds would be complete without some discussion of how the industry fared
during and after the recent financial crisis, and we provide such a post-mortem in Section
7. Finally, in Section 8 we turn to some practical considerations for today’s hedge-fund
investors, and conclude in Section 9.

Hedge Fund Characteristics

Hedge funds generally have more complex structural and risk characteristics than mutual
funds and other traditional investment vehicles. In Sections 2.1–2.4 we highlight four of
the most important of these characteristics from an investor’s perspective: fees, leverage,
restrictions on entering and exiting a hedge fund, and the dynamic nature of assets under
management.

2

2.1

Fees

Most hedge funds charge annual fees consisting of two components: a fixed percentage of
assets under management (typically 1% to 2%) and an incentive fee that is a percentage
(typically 20%) of the fund’s annual net profits, which is often defined as the fund’s total
earnings above and beyond some minimum threshold such as the LIBOR return, and net of
previous cumulative losses (often called a “high-water mark”).1 The usual justification for
such a fee structure is that the fixed fee covers the basic operating expenses of the fund, and
the incentive fee aligns the interests of the manager with the investor in that the manager
is paid an incentive if and only if the manager has made money for the investor not only in
the current year but since inception.
Of course, the same logic should apply to portfolio managers of other types of investment
vehicles such as mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and pension funds, yet none of
them earn incentive fees. The more practical answer to why hedge funds charge an incentive
fee in addition to a fixed fee is “because they can”. In other words, hedge funds claim to
offer unique sources of investment return, i.e., alpha, and they are willing to share some of
this alpha with investors for a price. That price is the fee structure that hedge funds charge.
Is it justified?
Titman and Tiu (2011) argue that better-informed hedge funds have less exposure to
common-factor risks, and show that funds with less factor exposures—as measured by the R2
of a regression of their monthly returns on various factors—tend to have higher Sharpe ratios,
something investors will gladly pay for. As a result, funds in the lowest R2 quartile charge, on
average, 12 basis points more in management fees and 385 basis points more in incentive fees
compared to hedge funds in the highest R2 quartile. Goetzmann, Ingersoll, and Ross (2003)
conjecture that the option-like fees commanded by hedge funds exist because hedge-fund
strategies have limited capacity, hence good recent performance cannot be rewarded with
fees that scale linearly with assets under management. They estimate that the present value
of fees and other costs could be as high as 33% of the amount invested. However, Ibbotson,
Chen, and Zhu (2011) decompose their estimated pre-fee 1995–2008 average hedge fund
return of 11.13% into 3.43% of fees, 3.00% of alpha, and 4.70% of beta.
Feng, Getmansky, and Kapadia (2013) develop an algorithm to empirically estimate
monthly fees, fund flows, and gross asset values of individual hedge funds. They find that
management fees represent a major component in the dollar amount of total hedge fund fees
(62% equally-weighted and 54% value-weighted). Anson (2001) shows that incentive fees
1

A high-water mark is a contractual provision that requires losses in any given year to be carried forward
for purposes of incentive-fee computations, so that incentive fees are paid only on net profits, i.e., profits net
of any previous cumulative losses.

resemble a call option at maturity, and that hedge-fund managers can increase the value
of this option by increasing the volatility of their assets. Aragon and Qian (2010) examine
the role of high-water mark provisions in hedge fund compensation contracts. The authors
suggest that compensation contracts in hedge funds help alleviate inefficiencies created by
asymmetric information.
Fees may be relevant to investors not only because of their direct impact on returns,
but also because they impact manager behavior. Using the Zurich hedge-fund database,
Kouwenberg and Ziemba (2007) find that hedge funds with incentive fees have significantly
lower mean returns (net of fees), while downside risk is positively related to the incentive-fee
level. Agarwal, Daniel, and Naik (2009) propose using the “delta” of the hedge fund manager
(defined as the expected dollar increase in the manager’s compensation for a 1% increase
in the fund’s net asset value), the hurdle rate, and the high-water mark provision to proxy
for managerial incentives. The authors find that hedge funds that have larger deltas and
high-water marks perform better.
Fees are especially relevant for funds of funds, as Brown, Goetzmann, and Liang (2004)
conclude. They find that individual funds dominate funds of funds in terms of net-of-fee
returns and Sharpe ratios, which they attribute to the double fees implicit in fund-of-funds
compensation structures. This consists of the fees charged by all the constituent funds as
well as a second layer of fees charged by the fund of funds, typically a 1% fixed fee and a 10%
incentive fee. Table 1 provides a simple illustration of this effect for a hypothetical fund of
funds charging 1% and 10% and investing an equal amount of its assets in two funds, A and
B, each charging 2% and 20%. If both of the underlying hedge-fund managers generate gross
returns of 20%, the net-of-fee return for the fund-of-funds investor is a reasonably attractive
11.70%, with fees comprising 41.50% of the total gross investment returns and the rest going
to the investor. However, if manager A earns a gross return of 20% and manager B loses
5%, the net-of-fee return for the fund-of-funds investor is only 2.25%; in this case, the vast
majority of the total gross investment return (70%) is paid to the individual managers and
the fund-of-funds manager as fees. More importantly, such a double layer of fees implies
certain incentives to take on higher-risk investments as well as high-Sharpe-ratio strategies
that can be leveraged at the fund of funds level so as to generate incentive fees on the
portfolio of hedge funds.

2.2

Leverage

Hedge funds often employ leverage in their strategies to boost returns. Leverage involves
borrowing capital—usually from banks or broker/dealers—which is used to increase a fund’s

investment in its strategies, thereby magnifying its gains and losses.2 In particular, leverage
increases both the expected return and volatility of any strategy. Accordingly, it is most
relevant for strategies that have low volatility because they can afford to be leveraged without
generating unacceptable levels of risk. However, return volatility is not the only type of risk
that is relevant for leveraged investments—illiquidity risk often accompanies low-volatility
investments and we shall consider this in more detail in Section 5. The amount of leverage
varies considerably across hedge funds and over time, from none to a large multiple of assets
under management, and margin calls are quite common during financial crises, after which
many hedge funds are forced to shut down because of extreme losses stemming from excessive
leverage (see Section 7).
Several authors have identified key drivers in determining how hedge funds adjust their
leverage over time. Ang, Gorovyy, and van Inwegen (2011) find that economy-wide factors tend to predict changes in hedge-fund leverage better than fund-specific characteristics.
Decreases in funding costs and fund return volatilities, and increases in market values all
forecast increases in hedge fund leverage. The authors conclude that hedge fund leverage
decreased prior to the start of the financial crisis in 2007 and was at its lowest in early 2009
when the leverage of investment banks was the highest. In a related study, Cao, Chen, Liang,
and Lo (2013) show that hedge funds are able to adjust their portfolios’ market exposure as
aggregate market liquidity conditions change. Using a large sample of equity-oriented hedge
funds from 1994 through 2009, they find strong evidence of liquidity timing ability, and in
out-of-sample tests they find that top liquidity-timing funds outperform bottom liquiditytiming funds by 4.0% to 5.5% annually on a risk-adjusted basis (see Section 4.3 for further
discussion).

2.3

Share Restrictions

The ability to invest or withdraw money from a hedge fund is often subject to various share
restrictions. For example, new investors have to undergo a subscription process before their
funds are invested in a hedge fund. Also, because of capacity constraints of a given strategy,
hedge fund managers might decide to close a fund to new investors. Restrictions are also
often imposed on fund withdrawals. For example, new investors (and new deposits) are often
subject to a one-year “lockup” period during which investors cannot withdraw their funds.
In addition, all withdrawals are subject to advance notice (typically 30 days but sometimes
2

Leverage is typically measured by the ratio of the total gross investments, both long and short, to the
assets under management. For example, a $100 million portfolio consisting of $100 million of long positions
and $100 million of short positions has a total gross investment of $200 million hence its leverage ratio is
2-to-1.

as long as one year) and redemption periods (usually quarterly or annually). During periods
of financial distress, hedge-fund managers sometimes impose “gates”, temporary restrictions
on how much of an investor’s capital can be redeemed within a given period of time. Such
restrictions are meant to protect against “fire-sale” liquidations that can generate extreme
losses for the fund’s remaining investors.
Ang and Bollen (2010) model the investor’s decision to withdraw capital as a real option
and treat lockups and notice periods as exercise restrictions. They estimate that a twoyear lockup with a three-month notice period for redemptions is worth approximately 1% of
the investment capital of an investor with constant relative risk aversion utility and a risk
aversion coefficient of 3. They also find that a manager’s discretion to impose gates during
times of especially high illiquidity—as many managers did during the 12- to 18-month period
following the 2008 stock market decline—can cost investors much more.
Aragon (2007) studies the relation between hedge-fund returns and lockup restrictions,
and concludes that hedge funds with lockup restrictions have 4% to 7% per year higher
excess returns than those of non-lockup funds. Aragon, Liang, and Park (2013) find that
onshore hedge funds impose stronger share restrictions than offshore hedge funds, such as a
lockup provision, but hold more liquid assets. Aragon and Qian (2010) find that high-water
marks are commonly used by funds that restrict investor redemptions.
Among the hedge funds that imposed gates during the recent financial crisis, Aiken,
Clifford, and Ellis (2013) observe that the use of these restrictions was more common among
funds with lockup provisions. This suggests that the 4–7% in excess returns reflects illiquidity
risk from both lockups as well as discretionary liquidity restrictions such as gates. Ramadorai
(2012) documents that funds that are gated can be traded on secondary markets for hedge
funds, often at substantial discounts, but sometimes at premiums. This means that we
can measure the monetary impact of share restrictions on funds. Discounts and premiums
at which these shares are traded bear an intriguing resemblance to closed-end mutual-fund
discounts and premiums, and are related to measures of fund illiquidity and performance.

2.4

Fund Flows and Capital Formation

A number of studies have documented a positive empirical relationship between fund flows
and recent performance, suggesting that hedge-fund investors chase positive returns and
flee from negative returns (Goetzmann, Ingersoll and Ross (2003), Baquero and Verbeek
(2009), and Getmansky, Liang, Schwarz, and Wermers (2015)). However, the particular
relation between fund flows and investment performance is often nonlinear and depends on
a combination of factors including manager alpha, investor perceptions, market conditions,
7

fund restrictions (see Section 2.3), and other hedge-fund characteristics.
Aragon, Liang, and Park (2013) find that capital flows are less sensitive to past performance in onshore funds compared to offshore funds due to regulation on advertising for
onshore hedge funds. Goetzmann, Ingersoll, and Ross (2003) conjecture that unwillingness
of successful funds to accept new money may be indicative of diminishing returns in the
industry as a whole as investments flow in. Aragon and Qian (2010) find that high-water
marks are associated with greater sensitivity of investor flows to past performance, but less
so following poor performance.
Baquero and Verbeek (2009) explore the flow-performance relationship by separating
inflows and outflows using a regime-switching model. They find a weak positive response
of fund inflows to past performance at quarterly horizons but a very pronounced positive
response of fund outflows to past performance. However, this pattern is reversed at an annual
horizon. Teo (2011) evaluates a group of liquid hedge funds and concludes that for this group,
funds with high net inflows subsequently outperform funds with low net inflows by 4.79%
per year after adjusting for risk. He defines liquid funds as those allowing monthly or lessthan-monthly redemptions. The return impact of fund flows is stronger when funds embrace
liquidity risk, when market liquidity is low, and when funding liquidity (as measured by the
Treasury-Eurodollar spread, aggregate hedge-fund flows, and prime broker stock returns) is
tight. Fung, Hsieh, Naik, and Ramadorai (2008) find that alpha-producing funds of funds
experience far greater and steadier capital inflows than non-alpha producers.
Getmansky, Liang, Schwarz, and Wermers (2015) study the effect of share restrictions on
the relation between a fund’s capital inflows/outflows and its performance, and document
a convex flow-performance relation in the absence of share restrictions (similar to mutual
funds), but a concave relation in the presence of restrictions. Further, they find that live
funds are subject to stricter restrictions than defunct funds.
Baquero and Verbeek (2014) find that the lengths of winning and losing streaks (the
number of subsequent quarters a fund performs above or below a given benchmark) significantly impacts future fund flows. However, the authors conclude that such a simple
heuristic is sub-optimal and that investors would have performed better by simply using
recursive out-of-sample forecasts from basic linear regressions.
Agarwal, Aragon, and Shi (2014) concentrate on fund flows of funds of funds. They
find that funds of funds experiencing large outflows tend to liquidate holdings in funds with
relatively few redemptions (i.e., liquid funds), even when these funds perform well. The
authors conjecture that the best performing hedge funds are unlikely to accept capital from
funds of funds that are subject to greater liquidity mismatches because hedge funds are likely
to face significant redemption requests in the case of large outflows from funds of funds.
8

Baquero and Verbeek (2009) do not find evidence that hedge fund flows can predict future
returns, i.e., the “smart money” effect.

An Overview of Hedge-Fund Return Data

Hedge funds are under no obligation to report their monthly returns to any parties other than
their investors and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).3 However, this data
is not publicly available. Because investment strategies are currently not patentable, hedge
funds protect their intellectual property—which includes their historical returns—through
trade secrecy. Some of the most successful hedge funds do not provide their returns to any
third party, hence we can only speculate as to their performance.
Offsetting this reluctance, however, is the need for most hedge funds to attract new capital
from investors. SEC Rule 502(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 bars hedge-fund advisers
from general advertising, including any form of communication published in newspapers or
magazines, or broadcast over television or radio. Therefore, many hedge-fund advisers choose
to self-report to commercial databases in order to market their funds and attract new clients.4
A cottage industry of hedge-fund data vendors has grown to accommodate this need, and
now many hedge funds share their return information with one or more of the companies
listed in Section 3.1 that maintain databases of historical hedge fund returns. Although such
data are not free, potential investors and academics can purchase access through monthly
or annual subscription fees. Much of what we know about hedge funds, and most of the
empirical research on this industry, depends upon such archival data.
Many researchers have pointed out that the voluntary reporting of these returns yields
selection biases (e.g., survivorship and back-fill bias) that can affect statistical inference in
various ways, and we consider their potential impact in Section 3.2. Although biases can
arise in any dataset, they are likely to be more severe when there is greater filtering of the
entries, either deliberately or through industry forces. In Section 3.3, we attempt to quantify
one aspect of this filtering by exploring the dynamics of hedge-fund entries and exits each
year. Any financial decision based on hedge-fund data should take these biases and dynamics

On October 26, 2011, the SEC unanimously voted to adopt Rule 204(b)-1 (the “Rule”) under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), which implements Sections 404 and
406 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Rule requires certain SEC registered investment advisers to make periodic
informational filings on Form PF detailing certain information with respect to private funds that they
manage. Under the rule, as of 2012, all SEC-registered investment advisers that have at least $150 million
in regulatory “assets under management” in one or more private funds have to file Form PF. However, Form
PF is currently not publicly disclosed.

into account in some manner.
We conclude our survey of basic hedge-fund data by describing the properties of hedgefund indexes in Section 3.4. Despite the use of the term “index”, no hedge-fund index is
currently investable to the same extent as traditional indexes such as the S&P 500. Nevertheless, as indicators of broad industry performance, these indexes serve a useful purpose,
and their statistical characteristics highlight some interesting differences between alternative
and traditional investments.

3.1

Data Sources

Some of the most widely used hedge fund databases include Lipper TASS, Morningstar
Hedge/CISDM, Hedge Fund Research (HFR), Barclay Hedge, Albourne, Eurekahedge, eVestment Alliance, HedgeFund.net, HedgeCo.net, Mercer, Russell Mellon, U.S. Offshore Funds
Directory, and Wilshire (Odyssey). The type of data provided for each hedge fund may
include: its net monthly returns; assets under management; style category; reporting currency; the names of the principals, fund managers, and brokers; share restrictions; audit
company information; geography and composition of investments; and other information.
When comparing hedge fund databases, some key considerations are the number of funds in
the database, whether a graveyard database is available, and how long ago the database was
established.
It can also be useful to compare the coverage of different databases: for example, do they
cover complementary portions of the hedge fund universe, or are they redundant? With
access to both the Lipper TASS and Morningstar Hedge/CISDM databases, we found that
many of the funds are redundant even within a single database. This duplication is due to the
fact that funds often have multiple legal entities employing the same investment strategy, but
in different jurisdictions to accommodate onshore vs. offshore investors. For both the Lipper
TASS and Morningstar Hedge/CISDM databases, roughly one-third of the funds within each
of the databases are redundant. We identified redundant funds by searching for similarlynamed funds with highly correlated returns. We then checked how many incremental unique
funds are present in Morningstar Hedge/CISDM relative to Lipper TASS and found that
roughly half the funds in the Morningstar Hedge/CISDM database are also present in the
Lipper TASS database.
Schneeweis, Kazemi, and Szado (2011) compare the Lipper TASS and Morningstar
Hedge/CISDM hedge fund databases further and find some differences in return and risk
between the two databases at the portfolio and average manager levels. However, these differences are often relatively small. Liang (2000) compares hedge funds in the Lipper TASS
10

and HFR databases. He finds that for identical funds tracked by both databases, returns,
assets, fees, and investment style classifications can differ. He suggests that the Lipper
TASS database should be used for academic research because of its relative completeness
and accuracy. Much academic research does rely on the Lipper TASS database; however,
a combination of databases is also used by Ackermann, McEnally, and Ravenscraft (1999),
Fung and Hsieh (1997), Agarwal, Daniel, and Naik (2011), and others.
For this survey we use monthly returns data from the Lipper TASS database, subject to
minor cleaning to reduce the incidence of bad data, described in Appendix A.2.

3.2

Biases

When a hedge-fund manager reports its returns to any database, this is a purely voluntary
decision—managers are not required to disclose its returns to any data provider or regulator,
and are free to stop reporting at any time. Therefore, a number of biases may arise among
hedge-fund returns databases that are not present in other asset-pricing databases in which
all securities of a given type are included, e.g., the University of Chicago’s Center for Research
in Security Prices (CRSP) stock returns database.
First, given that the primary motivation for participating in a database is for marketing purposes, funds generally seem to begin contributing their returns to a database after
a period of outperformance. Because such funds are allowed to include prior returns upon
their entry into the database, this practice leads to “backfill bias” or “instant history bias”,
further boosting the average returns of funds in the database which are already inflated
from the selection bias associated with the decision to be listed. Fung and Hsieh (2000)
estimate a backfill bias of 1.4% per year for the Lipper TASS database from 1994 through
1998. Using the Managed Account Reports database (subsequently subsumed by Morningstar Hedge/CISDM) from January 1990 to August 1998, Edwards and Caglayan (2001)
estimate backfill bias of 1.2% per year.
Second, funds can choose to delist from the database at any time, and typically do so for
one of two reasons: (1) fund managers decide to close their funds to new investments because
they no longer have sufficient capacity; or (2) they shut down because of poor performance.
These two motivations impart considerably different biases on the data—collectively known
as “extinction bias”—the latter being more common and yielding a spurious favorable bias
on average investment returns.
Third, some databases do not include extinct funds. This introduces “survivorship bias”
and generally increases the average fund’s return since the vast majority of funds that leave

11

the database do so because they have underperformed and are shutting down.5 Survivorship
bias affects the estimated mean and volatility of hedge-fund returns as many authors have
pointed out.6 The estimated magnitude of this bias ranges from 0.16% (Ackermann, McEnally, and Ravenscraft (1999)) to 2% (Liang (2000), Amin and Kat (2003)) to 3% (Brown,
Goetzmann, and Ibbotson (1999)) for offshore hedge funds).
Aggarwal and Jorion (2010b) introduce the notion of “hidden survivorship bias”, which
they attribute to a merger between the Lipper TASS and Tremont databases: 60% of the
funds added to the Lipper TASS database between April 1999 and November 2001 are likely
to be survivors, i.e., funds that were alive as of March 31, 1999. This hidden survivorship bias
boosts average returns by more than 5% a year. The authors propose a sorting algorithm
to exclude these funds’ histories. Aggarwal and Jorion (2009 and 2010a) also find that both
the performance and risk of emerging hedge funds and managers are biased. Emerging funds
and managers have particularly strong financial incentives to create positive investment
performance and to take on greater risk. Liang (2003) finds that data quality is directly
related to auditing effectiveness—funds with more reputable auditors and more updated
auditing reveal less data inconsistency.
Aggarwal and Jorion (2009) document that typical hedge-fund volatilities tend to be
higher in the early years of the funds, but this result is entirely driven by the sample of
dead funds. Aggarwal and Jorion (2010a) find strong evidence of outperformance during
the first two to three years of existence. Joenväärä, Kosowski, and Tolonen (2014) show
that variations in database coverage with respect to defunct funds, small funds, fund characteristics, assets under management, and backfill bias can lead to different performance
results. The authors recommend using an aggregate database to conduct fund performance
analysis, adjusting for the attrition rate and “filling in” missing observations of assets under
management rather than dropping such observations from the analysis.
Fourth, most funds report their investment results net of management fees which consist
of fixed and incentive fees (see Section 2.1). While the fixed fee affects the first moment
of the distribution of returns, the variable incentive fee can affect higher moments and
5

However, survivorship bias is mitigated to some degree by the fact that some of the largest and most
successful funds are also not included because they have no need to raise additional assets and prefer to keep
their performance strictly confidential. Nevertheless, because there are considerably more underperforming
funds than outperforming ones, the net effect of survivorship bias is to impart an upward bias on average
returns.

See, for example, Brown, Goetzmann, Ibbotson, and Ross (1992), Schneeweis, Spurgin, and McCarthy
(1996), Fung and Hsieh (1997, 2000), Hendricks, Patel, and Zeckhauser (1997), Ackermann, McEnally,
and Ravenscraft (1999), Brown, Goetzmann, and Ibbotson (1999), Carpenter and Lynch (1999), Brown,
Goetzmann, and Park (2001), Liang (2001), Baquero, Horst, and Verbeek (2005), Malkiel and Saha (2005),
and Horst and Verbeek (2007).

induce nonlinearities and discontinuities in standard risk/reward relations such as linear
factor models (see Section 6.2). Furthermore, it is hard to reverse-engineer the gross returns
with precision because incentive fees may be different for each individual investor and subject
to additional considerations such as hurdle rates, high-water marks, and clawbacks. The
impact of these fees makes it harder to gauge the profitability of hedge funds’ strategies.
Fifth, many funds, especially larger and well-known funds that do not need any additional
advertisement, are more likely to refrain from reporting to commercial databases. This
“missing return bias” was first noted in Ackermann, McEnally, and Ravenscraft (1999).
Edelman, Fung, and Hsieh (2013) try to capture this bias by comparing non-reporting mega
hedge funds to large funds in the database. They collected information on mega funds from
two industry surveys, Hedge Fund 100 and the Billion Dollar Club, and find that both sets
of funds have similar behavior. However, some return differences emerge during large moves
in the credit market: mega funds apparently load up on the credit factor more than other
funds. The authors’ overall conclusion is that an index of reporting large firms is a reasonable
proxy for the performance of non-reporting mega firms.
Patton, Ramadorai, and Streatfield (2013) find that hedge fund returns change substantially depending on the vintage of the data that is provided by commonly available databases.
The authors explore numerous reasons for this empirical fact and document systematic variation that suggests this is a product of the voluntary disclosure regime for hedge fund data.
Finally, Aragon and Nanda (2015) find that monthly returns are sometimes strategically
delayed in reporting to the Lipper TASS database. Specifically, they observe delays of three
weeks on average, but document longer delays when performance is worse, public market
news is better, and fund investors are restricted from redeeming their shares. Returns
also tend to be reported simultaneously in clusters. Strategic listing decisions and issues
related to misreporting to hedge fund databases have been further studied by Jorion and
Schwarz (2014a, 2014b), who find that hedge fund managers strategically list their small,
best performing funds in multiple databases immediately while delaying listing for other
funds.
In the remainder of this survey, we adjust all results for survivorship and backfill biases using the follow process. We address survivorship bias by including the Lipper TASS
Graveyard database in our analysis, and we address backfill bias by deleting any returns that
appear to have been backfilled. We identify and delete backfilled returns based primarily on
a list of fund-inclusion dates provided by Lipper TASS. We also have access to a number
of monthly database snapshots from previous years and, based on the date of a fund’s first
appearance in these snapshots, we are able to delete some additional backfilled returns.

lags for the Lipper TASS database without any bias adjustments and with adjustments for
survivorship bias, for backfill bias, and for both during the sample period from January
1996 through December 2014. For this illustrative analysis, we constructed a time series of
cross-sectionally averaged hedge fund returns. While not an investable hedge-fund proxy, this
average clearly shows the general impact of these biases, which is relevant for both hedge-fund
research and practical hedge-fund investment decisions. These biases make hedge funds look
misleadingly attractive with respect to their average return, volatility, skewness, kurtosis,
and maximum drawdown. For example, the annualized mean return across all funds using
the unadjusted data is 12.6%, which is halved to 6.3% when survivorship and backfill biases
are addressed. Skewness, kurtosis, and maximum drawdowns increase significantly after
both bias adjustments. Volatility increases slightly, and the first-order autocorrelation stays
almost the same.

3.3

Entries and Exits

The hedge-fund industry saw a prolonged boom that lasted through 2007 (see Table 3). From
January 1996 through December 2006 more than twice as many new funds entered than exited the Lipper TASS database each year, despite the funds’ high single-digit attrition rates.
During the most recent five years, however, the process has reversed, and the number of exits
has greatly exceeded the number of entries. The recent history is particularly interesting, as
the number of funds peaked in 2007–2008, coinciding with the peak of the recent financial

14

crisis. In 2008, however, the attrition rate jumped to 21%, the average return was the lowest
of any year (−18.4%), and 71% of all hedge funds experience negative performance. In the
years following the crisis, rather than rebounding to pre-crisis levels, the number of hedge
funds reporting to the TASS database has declined markedly, particularly in the last part
of the sample: 2012, 2013, and 2014. In 2014, for example, the attrition rate rose to an
unprecedented 26%. This suggests that either the number of hedge funds is declining or that
fewer hedge funds are choosing to report their returns to the TASS commercial database.
These industry-wide statistics obscure interesting variations within the highly heterogeneous hedge-fund industry. For example, emerging-market funds saw a spike in fund exits
associated with the Asian and Russian crises: 10 exits in 1997 and 11 in 1999, but 30 exits in
1998. Fixed-income arbitrage funds, presumably investing in a manner similar to Long-Term
Capital Management (LTCM),7 saw a similar pattern: 4 exits in 1997 and 6 exits in 1999,
but 13 exits in 1998.
One final striking feature of the Lipper TASS database involves funds of funds: these
investment vehicles proliferated rapidly through 2007, with the number of funds growing by
more than 20% every year. By the end of 2007, there were 4,506 of them in the database,
and during this period (1996–2007) the attrition rate averaged 5%, lower than that of singlemanager funds. However, the fund formation rate in 2008–2014 was on average only 8% per
year, and the attrition rate leapt to 19% per year, implying significant decline in this sector.8
The survival rates of hedge funds have been estimated by a number of authors. Brown,
Goetzmann, and Park (2001) show that the probability of liquidation increases with increasing risk, and that funds with negative returns for two consecutive years have a higher risk
of shutting down. Liang (2000) finds that the annual hedge-fund attrition rate is 8.3% for
the 1994–1998 sample period using Lipper TASS data, and Horst and Verbeek (2007) find a
slightly higher rate of 8.6% for the 1994–2000 sample period. Horst and Verbeek (2007) also
find that surviving funds outperform non-surviving funds by approximately 2.1% per year,
which is similar to the findings of Fung and Hsieh (2000, 2002) and Liang (2000), and that
investment style, size, and past performance are significant factors in explaining survival
rates. Many of these patterns are also documented by Liang (2000). In analyzing the life
cycle of hedge funds, Getmansky (2012) finds that the liquidation probabilities of individual
hedge funds depend on fund-specific characteristics such as past returns, asset flows, age,
and assets under management as well as category-specific variables such as competition and
favorable positioning within the industry. Further, Liang and Park (2010) demonstrate that

traditional risk measures like standard deviation cannot easily predict fund attrition, while
downside risk measures, including fat tails, are more effective.
Brown, Goetzmann, and Park (2001) find that the half-life of typical Lipper TASS hedge
funds is 30 months, while Brooks and Kat (2002) estimate that approximately 30% of new
hedge funds do not make it past 36 months due to poor performance and Amin and Kat
(2003) find that 40% of their sample of hedge funds do not make it to the fifth year. Howell
(2001) observes that the probability of hedge funds failing in their first year is 7.4%, only to
increase to 20.3% in their second year. Poor-performing younger funds drop out of databases
at a faster rate than older funds (see Getmansky (2012) and Jen, Heasman, and Boyatt
(2001)), presumably because younger funds are more likely to take additional risks to obtain
good performance which they can use to attract new investors, whereas older funds that
have survived already have track records with which to attract and retain capital.
Ineichen (2001), Kramer (2001), Feffer and Kundro (2003), and Getmansky, Lo, and Mei
(2004) study the reasons for hedge-fund liquidations, and categorize funds as “liquidated”
due to failure or fraud, or because they are no longer reporting to the database, closed to new
investment, or have merged into another entity. Ineichen (2001) describes and expands on an
explanation for hedge-fund disasters first advanced in 2000 by Louis Bacon—founder of the
successful hedge fund Moore Capital Management—who proposes five early warning signs:
excess size, excess leverage, lack of transparency, funding mismatches, and hubris. Kramer
(2001) focuses on fraud, providing detailed accounts of six of history’s most egregious cases.
Feffer and Kundro (2003) conclude that “half of all failures could be attributed to operational
risk alone”, of which fraud is one example. Getmansky, Lo, and Mei (2004) document the
empirical properties of a sample of 1,765 funds in the TASS Hedge Fund database from 1977
to 2004 that are no longer active. They find that attrition rates differ significantly across
investment styles—from a low of 5.2% per year on average for convertible arbitrage funds to
a high of 14.4% for managed futures funds—and relate a number of factors to these attrition
rates, including past performance, volatility, and investment style. They also find differences
in illiquidity risk between active and liquidated funds, with active funds exhibiting smoother
returns which are associated with more illiquid investments. They attribute this difference
to three potential explanations: smoother returns are indicative of better risk control, which
leads to lower attrition rates; smoother returns have higher Sharpe ratios which are more
attractive to investors; and the illiquidity premium increases expected returns, making these
investments more attractive than more liquid counterparts.
Aragon and Qian (2010) find that funds with high-water marks in their fee structures
can reduce inefficient liquidation by raising after-fee returns following poor performance.
Studying funds of funds, Fung, Hsieh, Naik, and Ramadorai (2008) find that alpha-producing
17

funds are not as likely to liquidate as those that do not deliver alpha.
Finally, Liang and Park (2010) find that funds with larger downside risk have a higher
hazard rate, after controlling for style, performance, fund age, size, lockup, high-water mark,
and leverage. The authors show that the real failure rate of hedge funds is 3.1% compared
to the attrition rate of 8.7% on an annual basis using 1995–2004 data. This implies that
hedge fund liquidation does not necessarily mean failure in the hedge-fund industry.

3.4

Hedge Fund Indexes

Just as investors find it useful to have a data vendor calculate and disseminate equity indexes
such as the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Russell 2000, and the MSCI
World, hedge-fund investors find it useful to be able to see a measure of the average performance of the hedge-fund industry. Accordingly, several firms calculate and disseminate
such aggregates. Because the industry is so heterogeneous, these firms generally also publish
category indexes. While some of these indexes are well over a decade old, a more recent
phenomenon is the emergence of daily hedge-fund indexes. Typically based on the returns
of a smaller number of hedge funds (relatively few hedge funds are willing to share daily
performance data), these indexes are less common.
Before turning to the properties of some commonly cited hedge-fund indexes in Section
4, it is important to qualify these results with the observation that such indexes are not
investable in the same way that popular equity and fixed-income indexes are investable. This
qualification is significant because many institutional investors such as pension funds base
their investment decisions on the properties of indexes. They have come to depend on indexes
because, as mostly passive investors, they concentrate on keeping costs to a minimum and
earning expected returns through buy-and-hold investments in assets that offer reasonable
long-term risk premia from “beta” or common risk exposures. Accordingly, such investors
focus more on asset-allocation decisions across asset classes, e.g., equities, fixed income, and
commodities, and within each asset class, the majority of the returns are generated through
low-cost passive vehicles that track the corresponding “benchmarks” to within basis points
of their monthly returns. Such benchmarks are almost always indexes such as the S&P 500
which have liquid investment vehicles like pooled funds and separately-managed accounts
that invest directly in the underlying securities, futures and swap contracts on such indexes,
ETFs, and more customized over-the-counter derivatives contracts. The combined effect of
these offerings is to allow large institutional investors to realize the stated performance of
indexes even when investing billions of dollars at a time.
The same cannot be said for any existing hedge-fund index. While some indexes include
18

funds still open to new investors, it is not yet possible to invest a billion dollars of assets
within a 30-day period in a hedge-fund index and expect to achieve nearly the same return
realized by that index during the same period. In contrast, the investment returns of a
$1 billion investment in the S&P 500 can be achieved by purchasing 3,042 S&P 500 futures
contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.9 This kind of passive, liquid, and near-perfect
index tracking is not yet possible for any existing hedge-fund index, hence hedge-fund index
performance results should be interpreted with this caveat in mind.

both investable and non-investable hedge funds. They find that key variables like fund
selection, asset liquidity, data frequency, sample period, and index-construction method have
significant explanatory power for a number of statistical properties of hedge-fund indexes.
One of the most important of these key variables is “investability”.

As of Wednesday May 23, 2012, the S&P 500 futures price for the June 2012 contract was 1315.70, and
the contract specification was 250 times the futures price, yielding a notional value of $328,952 per contract,
hence 3,042 contracts would generate a notional exposure of $1,000,589,850.00. On that day, the estimated
total volume of such contracts traded was 13,438 and the prior day’s open interest was 259,289, so 3,042
contracts would be a significant but not an infeasible position to establish over the course of a few trading
days.

A new group of indexes is built around the idea of “factor replication”. These indexes
generally aim to answer the following question: if a portfolio of liquid instruments is formed to
match the performance of the investable liquid-beta portion of typical hedge funds’ portfolios,
what would its returns be? These indexes can be used in determining whether funds of funds
are delivering alpha or beta, or as the basis for hedge-fund beta replication products (see
Section 6.6). This group consists of two subgroups: daily replication indexes published by
data vendors who seem to have begun calculating them as an extension of their existing
index business, and indexes published by asset management firms whose motivation appears
to be the support of hedge-fund beta replication funds launched by the same firms. We
include only the former subgroup in our summary.
In Table 4 we report information about index providers, index families, and the availability of the total industry and category indexes for commonly used hedge-fund indexes.
Monthly indexes reflect the returns of hedge funds that report to databases at a monthly
frequency. Daily indexes reflect the returns of hedge funds that are willing to report their
returns daily. Replication indexes are daily indexes that show the hypothetical profit and
loss for a factor-model-based hedge-fund beta replication strategy. The Total Industry Index
represents the aggregate performance of the entire hedge-fund industry. A Category Index
is designed to represent the performance of funds within a specific category.

Investment Performance

Despite the heterogeneity and uniqueness of individual hedge funds, most hedge funds share
common characteristics with others that deploy similar strategies and/or invest in similar
financial markets and securities. Based on these commonalities, hedge funds may be clustered
into “styles” or “categories”. One popular categorization is that provided by the Lipper TASS
database, which contains 11 main groupings: Convertible Arbitrage, Dedicated Short Bias,
Emerging Markets, Equity Market Neutral, Event Driven, Fixed Income Arbitrage, Global
Macro, Long/Short Equity Hedge, Managed Futures, Multi-Strategy, and Fund of Funds
(see the Appendix for definitions of these categories). While these categories do provide a
useful nomenclature for interpreting the investment performance of hedge funds, it should
be emphasized that the heterogeneity within any single category is considerably greater than
that of traditional investment categories such as large-cap growth or small-cap value funds.
We will illustrate both the commonalities and the heterogeneity of hedge-fund styles through
the statistical properties of their investment returns.
We begin in Section 4.1 with a summary of the hedge-fund performance literature in

20

which the risks and rewards of hedge funds are linked to attributes such as managerial
incentive structures, managers’ ability to hedge, strategy distinctiveness, connections with
political lobbyists, education and career concerns, confidential holdings, delayed reporting,
managerial skills, and capacity constraints. While several of these links are intuitive, the
more important questions are whether or not they imply performance persistence (which
we consider in Section 4.2), and whether hedge-fund managers can actively change their
positions and leverage in response to changes in market conditions (which we consider in
Section 4.3)? In Section 4.4 we show that hedge funds are not all alike by comparing the
investment performance of funds across different style categories, and we also show that
hedge funds are not all unique by identifying a number of common factors among them that
may reduce their diversification properties. We explore the investment implications of these
empirical findings in Section 8.3.

4.1

Basic Performance Studies

The empirical properties of hedge-fund performance have been documented by many authors
using several of the databases cited in Section 3.10 Unlike the literature on mutual-fund
performance, a number of these studies document positive risk-adjusted returns in the hedgefund industry, i.e., positive alphas.11 In fact, using data from 1995 to 2009, Ibbotson, Chen,
and Zhu (2011) find that alphas were positive every year of the past decade, even during the
recent financial crisis. More specifically, using a sample of 4,750 stock swap mergers, cash
mergers, and cash tender offers from 1963 to 1998, Mitchell and Pulvino (2001) find that
risk-arbitrage strategies generated excess returns of 4% per year.
Fung, Hsieh, Naik, and Ramadorai (2008) investigate performance, risk, and capital formation in the hedge-fund industry from 1995 to 2004, and over their 120-month sample, they
find that the average fund of funds delivered positive and statistically significant alpha only
in the 18-month sub-period between October 1998 and March 2000. Malkiel and Saha (2005)
report that, after adjusting for various hedge-fund database biases, hedge funds significantly
underperform their benchmarks on average, and our results confirm these findings. In a
sample of 7,000 hedge funds, Billio, Frattarolo, and Pelizzon (2014) find that alpha changes

See, for example, Ackermann, McEnally, and Ravenscraft (1999), Liang (1999, 2001, 2003), Agarwal
and Naik (2000b, 2000c), Fung and Hsieh (2000, 2001), Edwards and Caglayan (2001), Kao (2002), and
Kosowski, Naik, and Teo (2007). More detailed performance attribution and style analysis for hedge funds
has been considered by Fung and Hsieh (1997, 2002), Brown, Goetzmann, and Ibbotson (1999), Agarwal and
Naik (2000b, 2000c), Brown, Goetzmann, and Park (2000, 2001), Liang (2001),Lochoff (2002), and Brown
and Goetzmann (2003).

dramatically through time, across categories, and is related to the level of competition among
hedge funds.
Several studies link hedge-fund performance to various hedge-fund and strategy characteristics such as managerial incentive structures, geography, career concerns, strategy capacity, strategy distinctiveness, political connections, and even manager SAT scores. Agarwal,
Daniel, and Naik (2009) find that hedge funds with greater managerial incentives (proxied by
the delta of option-like incentive fee contracts), higher levels of managerial ownership, and
the inclusion of high-water mark provisions in the incentive contracts are associated with
superior performance. Getmansky (2012) documents a concave relationship between size
and performance for illiquid and capacity-constrained hedge funds, which connects strategy
capacity with fund performance. Ramadorai (2013) defines capacity constraints based on
past flows, fund size, and a novel variable—an indicator variable that indicates whether the
fund’s management company launched a new fund or a new share class. Consistent with
other results in the literature, he finds that capacity constraints lead to a reduction in future
returns.
Sun, Wang, and Zheng (2012) show that hedge-fund strategy distinctiveness is associated with higher performance, and Titman and Tiu (2011) find that managers’ ability to
hedge is directly related to hedge-fund performance. Gao and Huang (2014) conclude that
hedge-fund managers gain an informational advantage in securities trading through their
connections with political lobbyists. They identify politically sensitive companies as those
with high lobbying expenditures relative to their operating cash flows and find that politically connected hedge funds outperform non-connected funds by 1.6% to 2.5% per month
on their holdings of politically sensitive stocks as compared to their less politically sensitive
holdings. Teo (2009) shows that hedge funds with headquarters or a research office in their
investment region outperform those without it, suggesting that local funds possess an informational advantage. Liang and Park (2007) show that downside risk measures incorporating
higher return moments can effectively predict future fund performance. And Li, Zhang, and
Zhao (2011) conclude that education and career concerns can positively impact hedge fund
performance—managers from undergraduate institutions with higher average SAT scores
apparently have higher raw and risk-adjusted returns.
Hedge-fund performance has also been linked to macroeconomic factors. For example,
Avramov, Kosowski, Naik, and Teo (2011) show that conditioning on macroeconomic variables such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) and default
spreads is important in detecting managerial skill, and this information can be exploited
in forming optimal portfolios of hedge funds. These results can be interpreted in at least two
ways: managerial alpha is, in fact, attributable to “exotic betas”, or hedge-fund managers
22

generate alpha when macro conditions are conducive. We shall have more to say about
factors driving hedge-fund returns in Section 6.
An important focus of research on hedge fund performance is managers’ ability to perform during periods of market distress. Gao, Gao, and Song (2014) show that hedge-fund
managers with better skills in exploiting the market’s ex ante disaster concerns deliver superior returns. Jiang and Kelly (2012) find that hedge funds are exposed to downside “tail
risk” (the risk of rare events), so that a one-standard deviation positive shock to tail risk is
associated with a contemporaneous decline of 2.88% per year in the value of the aggregate
hedge-fund portfolio.
There is also a growing literature on the long-equity holdings of hedge funds retrieved
from 13F filings with the SEC.12 Brunnermeier and Nagel (2004) examine long stock holdings
of hedge funds during the time of the Technology Bubble in 2000 and find that hedge funds
reduced their exposure to technology stocks before prices collapsed and their technology
stock holdings outperformed characteristics-matched benchmarks. Griffin and Xu (2009)
show that hedge-fund managers are only marginally better than mutual-fund managers in
stock picking, and also find weak evidence of differential ability among hedge funds.
Agarwal, Jiang, Tang, and Yang (2013) study quarter-end equity holdings of hedge
funds that are disclosed with a delay through amendments to their 13F filings. Hedgefund managers delay reporting their positions due to concerns about private information
and price impact. Hedge funds managing large and concentrated portfolios, adopting nonstandard investment strategies with higher idiosyncratic risk, and holding stocks associated
with information-sensitive events such as mergers and acquisitions seek confidentiality more
frequently. The authors find that confidential holdings exhibit superior performance up to
twelve months, and take longer to build. Aragon, Hertzel, and Shi (2013) find that managers
seek confidential treatment of some of their 13F-reportable positions in order to hide confidential information from the public. The hedge fund managers are also more likely to seek
confidential treatment of illiquid positions that are more susceptible to front-running. 13F
public filings thus are likely to attract informed hedge fund traders and investors. However,
there are some significant challenges in the detection of informed trading by hedge funds
because they pertain to a narrow scope of reportable securities, exclude short positions, and
are observable at a low (quarterly) frequency.
12
Standard databases such as Thomson-Reuters Institutional Holdings systematically omit certain positions that are 13F-reportable such as call- and put-option positions (Aragon and Martin (2012)), and confidentially held stock positions (Agarwal, Jiang, Tang, and Yang (2013), Aragon, Hertzel, and Shi (2013)),
hence researchers should also check SEC filings directly.

23

4.2

Performance Persistence

The evidence regarding performance persistence is mixed. Agarwal and Naik (2000a) and
Chen (2007) find that monthly hedge-fund performance persists for short periods, but disappears at an annual horizon. Using annual offshore hedge-fund data, Brown, Goetzmann, and
Ibbotson (1999) find no evidence of performance persistence. Edwards and Caglayan (2001)
use both parametric and non-parametric procedures to study persistence over one- and twoyear horizons and also find no persistence, though they do observe considerable variation
across style categories. Boyson (2008) does not find any performance persistence over short
and long intervals when funds are selected based purely on past performance, but when
manager tenure is taken into consideration, hedge funds do seem to exhibit performance
persistence over quarterly intervals.
However, Bares, Gibson, and Gyger (2003) do find short-term persistence, and Baquero,
Horst, and Verbeek (2005) find persistence in hedge funds at the quarterly frequency after
correcting for investment styles, but persistence is statistically insignificant annually. Kat
and Menexe (2003) find weak persistence in mean returns, but strong persistence in hedge
funds’ standard deviations and their correlation with the stock market. Fung, Hsieh, Naik,
and Ramadorai (2008) find that there is a greater chance for a fund to deliver alpha in the
subsequent two-year period if it has positive estimated alpha in the previous two-year period.
In particular, they show that the overall average transition probability for a positive-alpha
fund into the subsequent positive-alpha group is 28%, while the transition probability for
a no-alpha fund is only 14%. Moreover, the year-by-year alpha-transition probability for a
positive-alpha fund is always higher than that for a no-alpha fund, implying greater alpha
persistence among members of the positive-alpha group. Consistent with these findings,
Jagannathan, Malakhov, and Novikov (2010) document significant performance persistence
among superior hedge funds, while they find little evidence of persistence among inferior
funds.
Persistence in hedge fund performance challenges the no-persistence equilibrium result
of the Berk and Green (2004) model for mutual funds. Extending the model to deliver
persistence in a hedge fund setting may be an interesting direction for future research (e.g.,
Glode and Green (2011)).

4.3

Timing Ability

Among the entire population of professional investment managers, hedge funds should be
the most likely to display timing skills of some form given that they are less constrained and
more active. In fact, because of their broader investment mandates and greater flexibility to
24

exploit investment opportunities as they emerge, hedge funds can engage in several forms of
timing, e.g., market timing, volatility timing, and liquidity timing. The empirical evidence
generally seems to support this intuition.
Fung, Xu, and Yau (2002) examine global hedge-fund managers and conclude that they do
not show positive market timing ability, but have superior security-selection ability. Aragon
(2005) finds that funds of funds do not exhibit timing ability, but that market-timing ability
is positive for funds holding the most liquid portfolios and negative for funds holding the
most illiquid portfolios. However, Chen (2007) extends the timing measures in Treynor and
Mazuy (1966) and Henriksson and Merton (1981) and finds significant market-timing ability
for individual hedge funds and funds of funds in bond, currency, and equity markets. Chen
and Liang (2007) propose a new market-timing measure by relating fund returns to the
squared Sharpe ratio of the market portfolio. Using a sample of 221 market-timing funds
from January 1994 through June 2005, they find economically and statistically significant
evidence of return timing, volatility timing, and joint timing, both at the aggregate and
individual-fund levels.
Kazemi and Li (2009) consider the market- and volatility-timing ability of commodity
trading advisors (CTAs), and observe that CTAs display a negative relationship between
market-timing and security-selection ability. They also find that systematic CTAs are, in
general, better at market timing than discretionary CTAs. Cave, Hubner, and Sougne (2012)
identify “positive”, “mixed”, and “negative” market timers and study their performance during the financial crisis of 2007–2009. Aragon and Martin (2012) study volatility timing ability
and selectivity skill revealed by the use of calls, puts, and equity positions by hedge-fund
investment advisers. They find that hedge funds successfully use derivatives to profit from
private information about stock fundamentals. For example, hedge funds greatly increased
their use of puts in the aftermath of the Technology Bubble, and there is a strong positive
(negative) relation between call (put) holdings and subsequent abnormal stock returns. Chen
(2011) finds that 71% of hedge funds trade derivatives. After controlling for fund strategies
and characteristics, derivatives users on average exhibit lower market, downside, and event
risk.
Cao, Chen, Liang, and Lo (2013) examine the liquidity timing ability for hedge funds,
and find strong evidence at both the strategy and individual-fund levels. Specifically, they
show that hedge-fund managers increase (decrease) their portfolios’ market exposure when
equity-market liquidity is high (low), and liquidity timing is most pronounced when market
liquidity is very low.

25

4.4

Hedge-Fund Styles

Despite the heterogeneity among hedge funds and their myriad strategies, they do fall into
several broad groupings or categories of investment “styles”. Fung and Hsieh (1997) study
hedge-fund styles and find that the strategies are highly dynamic and behave very differently
from those used by mutual funds. To develop some intuition for these styles and how they
are related, we report in Table 5 the correlations of monthly average returns of hedge funds
in each Lipper TASS style category from January 1996 through December 2014. These
estimates show that the correlations between some categories’ average returns are as high as
0.77 (between Event Driven and Convertible Arbitrage categories), but Long/Short Equity
Hedge and Dedicated Short Bias are negatively correlated at −0.74, and Managed Futures
has virtually no correlation with any other category except for Global Macro. Fixed Income
Arbitrage and Convertible Arbitrage have much in common, and Event Driven is highly
correlated with several categories. Meanwhile, the Equity Market Neutral and Global Macro
categories have, at most, moderate correlations with other styles.

Table 5: Monthly correlations of the average returns of funds in each hedge-fund style
category. Correlations for the 10 main Lipper TASS hedge fund categories, Funds of Funds,
and All Single Manager Funds found in the Lipper TASS database from January 1996 through
December 2014 are reported. The All Single Manager Funds category includes the funds in all
10 main Lipper TASS categories and any other single-manager funds present in the database
(relatively few) while excluding funds of funds. Correlations are color-coded with the highest
correlations in blue, intermediate correlations in yellow, and the lowest correlations in red.
To develop further insight into these correlations, we consider a simple factor model
26

based on principal component analysis (PCA). From a PCA perspective, correlated hedgefund investment styles can be decomposed into a linear combination of uncorrelated “eigenstrategies”. PCA can tell us just how many uncorrelated eigen-strategies underpin the
majority of the performance of the 10 hedge-fund categories listed in Table 5. We find that
79% of the strategies’ volatility-equalized variances is explained by only three factors, suggesting that a large fraction of hedge funds’ returns are generated by a very small universe of
uncorrelated strategies. The fraction of variance explained by each of the first six eigenvalues
is as follows:
{λ1 : 52.3%, λ2 : 15.0%, λ3 : 11.0%, λ4 : 6.3%, λ5 : 3.7%, λ6 : 3.5%}.
To put the magnitude of these eigenvalues in context, we simulated one million correlation
matrices each based on 216 independently and identically distributed (IID) Gaussian returns
of 10 simulated time series from which we computed an empirical distribution of the matrices’ largest eigenvalues. The mean of this distribution is 13.51%, while the minimum and
maximum are 11.59% and 17.18%, respectively—all much smaller than the estimated λ1 .13
This suggests that the first principal component accounts for significantly more variability
than in the case of purely random returns, and hedge-fund category returns do have factors
in common.
As with any PCA decomposition, the principal components may not be easily interpretable and we caution against reading too much into their significance. However, the
distribution of the corresponding eigenvalues provides some insight into how many genuinely
unique investment strategies are reflected in category returns. In this respect, the PCA results are informative: the 10 categories’ returns are certainly not unique, but neither are they
all explained by a single factor. On the one hand, hedge-fund investors should be mindful
that the returns of any two hedge-fund styles may be driven by completely uncorrelated factors and that, far from any two hedge-fund investments being interchangeable, the choice of
hedge-fund style may be as significant as the choice between stocks and bonds. On the other
hand, because 80% of hedge-fund category returns are implicitly driven by three factors,
hedge-fund investors should also recognize that the benefits of diversification are limited;
the returns of, say, 20 hedge funds are unlikely to be completely uncorrelated.
13
For robustness we repeated the million-sample simulation using a fat-tailed distribution (the t distribution with one degree of freedom) and reached the same conclusion. The mean proportion of variance
explained by the largest eigenvalue is 13.57%, while the minimum and maximum are 10.24% and 37.23%,
respectively. Even with a fat-tailed distribution it is very unlikely that λ1 could be as large as 52.3% by
chance.

27

A more intuitive illustration of the heterogeneity and commonality among hedge-fund
styles is presented in Table 6, in which a variety of summary statistics such as average return,
volatility, Sharpe ratio, and higher-order moments are reported for hedge-fund category
returns. The top panel reports the summary statistics for the average fund (averaged across
all available funds in the Lipper TASS database for each month), and the bottom panel
reports the same summary statistics for the Credit Suisse/Dow Jones (CS/DJ) Hedge-Fund
Category Index.

Table 6: Summary statistics for the returns of the average fund in each Lipper TASS style
category and summary statistics for the corresponding CS/DJ Hedge-Fund Index. Number
of fund months, annualized mean, annualized volatility, Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, skewness, kurtosis, maximum drawdown, correlation coefficient with the S&P 500, first-order
autocorrelation, and p-value of the Ljung-Box Q-statistic with three lags for the 10 main
Lipper TASS hedge fund categories, Funds of Funds, and All Single Manager Funds found in
the Lipper TASS database from January 1996 through December 2014 are reported. Sharpe
and Sortino ratios are adjusted for the three-month U.S. Treasury Bill rate. The “All Single
Manager Funds” category includes the funds in all 10 main Lipper TASS categories and any
other single-manager funds present in the database (relatively few) while excluding funds of
funds.
We observe new patterns of similarities and differences among hedge fund categories in
Table 6. During the period from January 1996 through December 2014, Dedicated Short
Bias underperformed all categories, which is not surprising given that equities performed
well during a significant portion of the sample period. Consistent with Agarwal and Kale
(2007) we find that Multi-Strategy hedge funds outperformed Funds of Funds. The average
28

Managed Futures fund’s returns appear roughly IID and Gaussian, while the returns of the
average Convertible Arbitrage fund are autocorrelated and have fat tails. Although some
categories are uncorrelated or negatively correlated with stocks, Long/Short Equity Hedge,
Event Driven, and Emerging Markets funds have correlations with the S&P 500 total return
index of 0.74, 0.65, and 0.64, respectively. High correlation with a traditional equities-based
portfolio can undermine hedge funds’ diversification advantage.
Return volatility also differs considerably across categories. For example, volatility of
the average Emerging Markets fund is three times greater than that of the average Fixed
Income Arbitrage fund. Intriguingly, lower volatility does not unambiguously imply lower
risk: Managed Futures has high volatility but low maximum drawdown, while Fixed Income
Arbitrage and Multi-Strategy hedge funds have roughly half the volatility but a higher
maximum drawdown. These last two categories also have a history of negative skewness and
large kurtosis, i.e., their returns have fat left tails. Heuson, Hutchinson, and Kumar (2015)
show that traditional performance measures systematically under-estimate (over-estimate)
managerial performance when returns exhibit positive (negative) skewness, and propose a
new measure to account for skewness in performance measurement.
Figure 1 suggests that categories that exhibit higher autocorrelation generally also exhibit kurtosis and negative skewness (we show in Section 5 that positive autocorrelation
is a proxy for illiquidity risk). This cluster of traits should give investors cause for concern, so it is worth listing the hedge-fund styles that most clearly exhibit them: Convertible
Arbitrage, Fixed Income Arbitrage, Event Driven, Emerging Markets, and Multi-Strategy.
These strategies have the highest autocorrelations and the most fat-tailed return distributions. When investing in a fund with positively autocorrelated returns, investors may want
to consider the increased likelihood that a simple analysis based on the returns’ volatility
will understate the actual downside risk.
The extremely high autocorrelation of several categories’ returns demands further study,
hence in Figure 2 we display the 36-month rolling-window autocorrelation for each category.
Some categories exhibit consistently high autocorrelation while others exhibit little or negative autocorrelation. Curiously, some categories’ autocorrelations increased sharply during
the financial crisis while others’ were unaffected. For example, Figure 2(a) depicts, among
others, the 36-month rolling-window autocorrelation of the Convertible Arbitrage strategy
from January 1996 through December 2014. A comparison with subsequent figures shows
that over 19 years the average returns of funds in the Convertible Arbitrage category have
generally been more autocorrelated than those of any other category. Based on 36-month
rolling-window estimates, the autocorrelation has typically ranged between 0.2 and 0.6. It
fluctuated sharply during the recent financial crisis, and most recently has become negative

Illiquidity

Illiquidity is one of the most important characteristics of certain hedge fund investments
that has only recently begun to receive the attention it deserves. Not only is illiquidity at
the heart of most financial crises (see, for example, the discussion in Section 7), but it is
also central to how many financial investments generate their returns. Taking on illiquidity
risk is one of the most effective ways for long-horizon investors to build wealth, but it can
also be the downfall of investors who are unaware of their illiquidity exposure and attempt
to liquidate certain investments at the wrong time.
One of the biggest challenges to measuring illiquidity is the fact that there is currently
no single definition of liquidity. The reason is simple: liquidity is not a one-dimensional
characteristic, but has at least three distinct aspects to it. An asset is considered liquid if:
(1) it can be bought or sold quickly; (2) the amount that can be bought or sold is large; and
(3) buying or selling such large amounts will not adversely impact the market price. Certain
assets may have one or two of these properties, but only truly liquid assets will have all three.
For example, residential real estate can be sold quickly, but usually not without significant
price concessions, hence this asset would not be considered liquid. What makes liquidity even
harder to define is that these three characteristics are time- and context-dependent; what
is liquid today may be highly illiquid tomorrow. A clear illustration of just how dynamic
liquidity can be is the Quant Meltdown of August 2007, described in more detail in Section
7.1.
In Section 5.1, we review several measures of illiquidity that are specifically designed with
hedge funds in mind. We consider the impact of illiquidity on statistical measures of hedgefund performance such as volatilities, Sharpe ratios, and betas and how to correct for it in
5.2. Based on these and other measures of illiquidity, the magnitude of illiquidity risk premia
in hedge-fund returns can be quantified, which we describe in Section 5.3. And in Section
5.4, we show how to incorporate measures of illiquidity into the traditional mean-variance
portfolio optimization framework.

5.1

Measures of Illiquidity and Return Smoothing

The finance literature offers a number of theoretical and empirical measures of illiquidity
including percentage bid/offer spreads (Tiniç (1972), Glosten and Milgrom (1985), Amihud
and Mendelson (1986)), price impact (Kraus and Stoll (1972), Kyle (1985), Hasbrouck and
Schwartz (1988), and Lillo, Farmer, and Mantegna (2003)), and volume-based statistics (Lo,
Mamaysky, and Wang (2004), Lo and Wang (2006), and Pastor and Stambaugh (2003)).

32

However, these measures all assume the existence of a centralized exchange in which price
discovery occurs regularly, that there exist designated market makers who post bids and
offers, and that trading volume can be measured. As a result, none of these measures
are applicable to investments in hedge funds, of which the vast majority are structured as
privately placed securities.
Lo (2001) and Getmansky, Lo, and Makarov (2004) propose an alternate measure of
illiquidity that depends only on asset returns, return autocorrelation, ρk :
Cov[Rt , Rt−k ]

(2)

In an efficient market, asset returns should be approximately serially uncorrelated, hence
ρk = 0 for all k > 0—past returns should contain very little information about future returns, otherwise the information can be exploited via trading strategies that buy (shortsell)
securities with positive (negative) return forecasts. The very process of exploiting this information will tend to reduce, if not eliminate entirely, any return autocorrelation. The only
two reasons such information cannot be exploited and, therefore, eliminated, are: (1) if the
autocorrelation is due to time-varying equilibrium expected returns; and (2) if the autocorrelation cannot be exploited due to trading frictions, i.e., illiquidity. The first possibility
is less likely for shorter-horizon holding periods such as monthly or daily returns given the
definition of equilibrium expected returns, hence the second possibility is the more likely
explanation for significant return autocorrelation. In other words, returns may be autocorrelated because information about the underlying asset diffuses over time and investors with
early access to this information cannot exploit it because the asset cannot be traded quickly,
and/or cannot be traded in large size, and/or cannot be traded without moving the price
significantly.
Getmansky, Lo, and Makarov (2004) construct a simple econometric model to estimate
the degree of autocorrelation in hedge-fund returns by assuming that the true but unobservable economic return, Rt , of a hedge fund in period t satisfies a linear single-factor model:
Rt = µ + βΛt + ǫt , E[Λt ] = E[ǫt ] = 0 , ǫt , Λt ∼ IID

Var[Rt ] ≡ σ 2

(3a)
(3b)

33

whereas the reported return Rto is:
Rto = θ0 Rt + θ1 Rt−1 + · · · + θk Rt−k
θj ∈ [0, 1] , j = 0, . . . , k
1 = θ0 + θ1 + · · · + θk

(4)
(5)
(6)

which is a weighted average of the fund’s true returns over the most recent k + 1 periods,
including the current period. True returns represent the flow of information that would
determine the equilibrium value of the fund’s securities in a frictionless market, and observed
returns represent the results that the fund reports each month. Using maximum likelihood
to estimate the smoothing parameters {θj }, Getmansky, Lo, and Makarov (2004) confirm
that funds with higher autocorrelation tend to be the more illiquid funds, e.g., emerging
market debt, fixed income arbitrage, etc.
More generally, Khandani and Lo (2011b) establish a link between illiquidity and positive
autocorrelation in asset returns among a sample of hedge funds, mutual funds, and various
equity portfolios. For hedge funds, this link can be confirmed by comparing the return autocorrelations of funds with shorter vs. longer redemption-notice periods. They also document
significant positive return-autocorrelation in portfolios of securities that are generally considered less liquid, e.g., small-cap stocks, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and
emerging-market investments.
Getmansky, Lo, and Makarov (2004) and Bollen and Pool (2008) also observe that return
autocorrelation may be evidence of return smoothing, the unsavory practice of reporting only
part of the gains in the months when a fund has positive returns so as to partially offset
potential future losses, thereby reducing volatility and improving risk-adjusted performance
measures such as the Sharpe ratio (see Section 5.2). However, while large positive return
autocorrelations should raise concerns regarding the potential of deliberate return-smoothing
behavior, Getmansky, Lo, and Makarov (2004) emphasize that it is impossible to determine
whether a fund is intentionally smoothing returns just from its return autocorrelations.
Bollen and Pool (2009) and Jylha (2011) show that hedge funds often push otherwise
small negative returns above zero. Agarwal, Daniel, and Naik (2011) find evidence of manipulating reported returns upward in the month of December. Cici, Kempf, and Puetz (2015)
use 13F filings to show that hedge-fund advisers strategically employ mismarking in stock
positions to smooth their reported returns and push otherwise small negative returns above
zero.
Aragon and Nanda (2015) link reporting delays to return smoothing, through report34

ing returns in “clusters”. Patton, Ramadorai, and Streatfield (2013) find that hedge fund
performance is lower among funds that have restated their return history to a database, especially among funds that show a high degree of monthly return autocorrelation. Ben-David,
Franzoni, Landier, and Moussawi (2013) provide evidence suggesting that some hedge funds
manipulate stock prices on critical reporting dates. They find that stocks in the top quartile
of hedge fund holdings exhibit abnormal returns of 0.30% on the last day of the quarter and
a reversal of 0.25% on the following day. A significant part of the return is earned during the
last minutes of trading. Kruttli, Patton, and Ramadorai (2014) use an aggregate version of
the liquidity measure of Getmansky, Lo, and Makarov (2004), estimated across a large set
of hedge funds, and find that the measure has the ability to predict a large range of asset
returns (commodities, currencies, bonds, and equities). The authors relate this finding to
the role of hedge funds in liquidity provision in capital markets.

5.2

Illiquidity and Statistical Biases

Illiquidity can lead to a number of biases in the statistical properties of hedge-fund returns.
For example, using a linear moving average time series model for illiquid hedge-fund returns,
Getmansky, Lo, and Makarov (2004) show that standard estimators of volatility are biased
downward, Sharpe ratios are biased upward, and the betas of regressions of hedge-fund
returns on lagged market factors are non-zero. The authors find that after correcting for
the effects of smoothed returns, some of the most successful types of funds tend to have
considerably less attractive performance characteristics. Lo (2001) provides the appropriate
correction term for computing volatilities and Sharpe ratios in these cases, and shows that
corrected annualized Sharpe ratios based on monthly data can differ from the standard
Sharpe ratio estimator by as much as 70%. Asness, Krail, and Liew (2001) show that in
some cases where hedge funds purport to be market neutral, i.e., funds with relatively small
market betas (market exposure) when only contemporaneous returns are used as regressors,
including both contemporaneous and lagged market returns as regressors and summing the
beta coefficients, yields significantly higher market exposure, implying a certain degree of
illiquidity.
These empirical properties may have potentially significant implications for assessing the
risks and expected returns of hedge-fund investments, including potential fraud detection.

5.3

Measuring Illiquidity Risk Premia

Suppose investors are given the choice between two assets that are identical in all respects
but one: while one asset can be traded around the clock, the other asset can only be traded
on the first Tuesday of each month. Most investors would choose the first (more liquid) asset.
But when enough investors do this, the supply of the first asset may dwindle, and its price
would rise relative to the second asset. At some point, investors will feel that the discount
on the second asset—which yields a higher expected return today, assuming that its future
expected payoff is unchanged—is sufficiently large to compensate them for the infrequency
with which it can be traded, leading them to buy the second asset. The investors buying the
second asset will obtain a higher expected return than investors in the first asset in exchange
for accepting the risk that at the moment they want to sell their asset, it may not be possible
to do so. This incremental return is called the “illiquidity premium”.
Unfortunately, paired with the illiquidity premium is the illiquidity penalty: the periods
when many owners want to sell are typically times during which few investors want to buy, so
the asset’s price may plummet beyond reason. In these circumstances it may be impossible
to sell at a price near what an owner considers fair.
Liang (1999) and Aragon (2007) study the relation between hedge fund returns and a
very specific form of illiquidity—lockup restrictions—and document a positive relationship
between lockups and fund performance. Aragon (2007) finds that hedge funds with lockups
have 4% to 7% per year higher excess returns than those of non-lockup funds (see Section 2.3
for further discussion of lockups and other share restrictions). Sadka (2010, 2012) shows that
liquidity risk is an important determinant of the cross-sectional differences in hedge fund returns and concludes that hedge funds with significant liquidity risk subsequently outperform
low-liquidity-risk funds by an average of 6% annually. Consistent with Brunnermeier and
Pedersen (2009), Teo (2011) finds that hedge funds with strong incentives to raise capital,
low manager option deltas, and no manager capital co-invested are more likely to take on
excessive liquidity risk.
Using a sample of 2,927 hedge funds, 15,654 mutual funds, and 100 size- and bookto-market-sorted portfolios of U.S. common stocks, Khandani and Lo (2011b) construct
autocorrelation-sorted long/short portfolios and conclude that illiquidity premia are generally positive and significant, ranging from 2.74% to 9.91% per year among the various hedge
funds and fixed-income mutual funds. They do not find evidence for this premium among
equity and asset-allocation mutual funds, or among the 100 U.S. equity portfolios. The time
variation in their aggregated illiquidity premium shows that while 1998 was a difficult year
for most funds with large illiquidity exposure, the following four years yielded significantly
36

higher illiquidity premia that led to greater competition in credit markets, contributing to
much lower illiquidity premia in the years leading up to the Financial Crisis of 2007–2009.

5.4

The Mean-Variance-Illiquidity Frontier

Modern portfolio theory implies that, to earn higher expected returns, an investor must bear
higher systematic risk. While the historical time series evidence suggests that this is a good
general guide (see, for example, Ibbotson, 2013), we believe that this model is too narrowly
interpreted. Risk is generally thought of as the distribution of magnitudes of possible losses
over a given time period. In a well-functioning market, this characterization should be
conceptually adequate, even if, as a practical matter, obtaining a good estimate of risk is
non-trivial. However, when markets break down, some assets cease to have a meaningful
price—for a period of time, there may be no transactions at all. And if there are any sales,
they are generally made by investors desperate for cash and willing to sell at fire-sale prices.
The possibility of such temporary market failures is not captured very well by traditional
risk measures. Nevertheless, it is a type of risk, and it stands to reason that investors willing
to assume it should earn higher returns. Viewed this way, the illiquidity premium exists
because illiquid assets carry extra risk, albeit of a unique sort.
We test this hypothesis by using data for the 19-year period from January 1996 through
December 2014 and creating portfolios made up of three-month U.S. Treasury Bills, stocks,
bonds, and any blend of our 11 average hedge-fund-style return series. Traditional meanvariance optimization would produce an efficient frontier that shows the best return one could
have obtained for the indicated level of risk. In such an analysis, risk is typically proxied by
the annualized standard deviation of the portfolio’s returns. We generalize this framework
to include a second nonlinear constraint: autocorrelation. The resulting three-dimensional
surface based on volatility, return, and autocorrelation is depicted in Figure 3. Since return
autocorrelation is often associated with portfolio illiquidity (see Section 5.1), constraining a
portfolio to have low autocorrelation is likely to limit illiquidity risk and, consequently, also
limit the amount of illiquidity premium in the portfolio. Figure 3 shows that this is exactly
the case: to earn high returns in the period from 1996 through 2014, an investor would
have had to bear the risk of ordinary market fluctuations (volatility), the risk of temporary
market failure (illiquidity/autocorrelation), or a combination of both. The extra return that
corresponds to the increased autocorrelation is as much as 2%, which is broadly consistent
with other estimates of the illiquidity premium (Aragon (2007) and Sadka (2010, 2012)).
This analysis of the relationship between illiquidity and returns over the recent 19 years
suggests that investors may benefit from determining their tolerance for illiquidity alongside

their tolerance for traditional risk and choosing their asset allocation accordingly. Table 6
shows the striking differences in autocorrelation among hedge fund categories; it is possible
that the highly autocorrelated categories present investors with a greater opportunity to
earn the illiquidity premium while less autocorrelated categories present investors with more
protection against downside surprises due to market failures.

Hedge Fund Risks

What risks do hedge funds take and do they earn expected returns commensurate with those
risks? Understanding the answers to these two questions is crucial for any investor seeking
to determine whether a hedge fund investment would be a prudent addition to her portfolio.
The traditional investment framework of the Sharpe-Lintner Capital Asset Pricing Model
(CAPM) provides a natural starting point. Do hedge-fund expected returns exhibit any
alpha, i.e., do they exceed their risk-adjusted cost of capital where the risk adjustment is
with respect to their equity beta?
In many cases, the answer to this narrow question is yes, but there is a concern among
academics and hedge-fund investment professionals that a portion of this alpha may be
attributed to exposures to factors other than the stock market, e.g., other asset classes
such as commodities, currencies, and real estate. Moreover, many once-unique investment
strategies pioneered by the hedge-fund industry have become commoditized. For example,
the carry-trade, size-spread, and trend-following strategies are all so well-understood that
retail investors can now invest in them through ETFs and mutual funds that use mechanical
trading strategies.15 Exposures to all these well-understood drivers of returns may now
be thought of as “alternative” or “exotic” betas. Therefore, hedge-fund expected returns
are inextricably intertwined with the risk exposures associated with hedge-fund strategies.
Measuring and managing these exposures is the focus of this section.
In Section 6.1 we review how risk is measured and how hedge-fund managers adjust
their risk-taking in response to incentives. In Section 6.2 we discuss the use of linear factor
models, a common risk analysis tool that enables the user to estimate not only how much
risk is being taken, but also what kind of risk is being taken, even in the absence of portfolio
transparency. As useful as these models are, they have important limitations and in Section
6.3 we provide a specific example of how they can yield misleading results if used improperly.
In Section 6.4 we continue our focus on hedge fund risks, turning from market-based
risks to operational risks; in section Section 6.5 we describe how investors and hedge fund
15

39

managers manage the risks associated with hedge fund investing. In Section 6.6 we conclude
our discussion of hedge fund risks with the natural follow-on topic of hedge fund replication.16
As some aspects of hedge fund investing have become well-understood, investor demand has
grown for cheaper access to alternative betas. Hedge-fund replication strategies built to meet
this demand now invest billions of dollars around the world.

6.1

VaR and Risk-Shifting

Because of the heterogeneity and inherent nonlinearities of hedge-fund strategies, a natural
starting point for risk management in the hedge-fund industry is Value-at-Risk (VaR), a
concept that originated in the derivatives industry. Instead of adopting the traditional meanvariance framework of the investment management industry, derivatives traders and their
risk managers focus on estimating the likelihood of extreme losses over a given investment
horizon. If the daily change in the value of a portfolio is given by the random variable Xt ,
then the 5% one-day VaR of this portfolio is defined to be value K > 0 such that
Prob(Xt ≤ −K) = 5% .

(7)

By specifying a limit on K, investors and managers can control the amount of risk in their
portfolios. Of course, doing so requires the distribution of Xt which involves statistical
inference as well as considerable knowledge of the underlying strategies that generate Xt .
Jorion (2007) illustrates how VaR methods can be used to measure and control the
market risk of hedge funds. Gupta and Liang (2005) examine the risk characteristics and
capital adequacy through the VaR approach. They find that as of March 2003, 3.7% of
live funds and 10.9% of defunct funds were under-capitalized. Jorion (2008) develops methods to measure the forward-looking risk of portfolios exposed to corporate events such as
restructurings, bankruptcies, mergers, acquisitions, or other special situations. Using both
TASS and HFR databases, Bali, Gokcan, and Liang (2007) find that live funds with high
VaR outperform those with low VaR by 9% annually. On the other hand, the relationship
between downside risk and expected returns is negative for defunct funds. However, using
the TASS database Liang and Park (2007) describe shortcomings of VaR and find that other
left-tail risk measures such as Expected Shortfall and Tail Risk can be superior in explaining
the cross-sectional variation in hedge fund returns.
Brown, Goetzmann, and Park (2001) investigate risk-shifting in hedge funds, and find

evidence of tournament behavior among funds. Specifically, funds that exhibit good performance during the first half of the year tend to reduce the volatility of their portfolios during
the second half, and vice versa for funds that perform poorly during the first half of the
year. Agarwal, Daniel, and Naik (2002) also report this finding for hedge funds, using an
alternative method in high-water mark estimation. Hodder and Jackwerth (2007) analyze
the effect of incentive fees, high-water marks, and managerial ownership of shares on hedge
fund risk-taking. In a related paper, Panageas and Westerfield (2009) challenge the basic
intuition that convex compensation schemes—where managers are rewarded for gains but
not punished for losses—increase risk-taking. Convex payoffs are common in hedge fund
contracts, and the authors show that in an infinite-horizon setting, even a risk-neutral manager will not take unbounded risks. As a result, the incentive to take greater risk depends
on the interaction between convexity and finite horizons, not just on convex compensation
structures.
Using the Zurich hedge fund universe, Kouwenberg and Ziemba (2007) test the relation
between risk taking and incentive fees. They find that loss averse managers increase the
risk of the fund’s investment strategy with higher incentive fees. However, risk taking is
greatly reduced if a substantial amount of the manager’s own money (at least 30%) is in the
fund. Aragon and Nanda (2012) find that when hedge funds are likely to be liquidated, and
therefore managers do not expect to operate the funds for many periods, high-water marks
are far less effective in moderating risk-shifting following poor performance. Goetzmann,
Ingersoll, and Ross (2003) provide a closed-form solution to the high-water mark contract
under certain conditions. This solution shows that managers have an incentive to take risks.

6.2

Linear Factor Models

A more refined approach to risk management for hedge funds is to approximate a fund’s
return Rpt by a linear factor model:
Rpt = αp + βp1 F1t + · · · + βpK FKt + ǫpt

(8)

where the factors {Fit } are observable explanatory variables such as stock and bond indexes
or the returns of well-defined algorithmic strategies such as trend-following, mean-reversion,
or carry-trade strategies. Such factor models are especially useful for answering questions
about the likely impact of various scenarios on a hedge fund’s returns, e.g., how will a specific
hedge fund’s return be affected if the stock market declines by 10%?; how sensitive is it to
interest-rate fluctuations?; does the hedge fund employ momentum strategies?
41

The unexplained components of (8) are attributable to three sources: alpha (the unique
investment skills of the hedge-fund manager), omitted factors, and idiosyncratic returns.
The portion of the returns explained by the factors is generally referred to as beta(s), which
comes from the traditional Sharpe-Lintner CAPM investment framework.
Linear factor models can provide insight into the intrinsic characteristics and risks of a
hedge fund’s investments and how they vary across time and circumstances. For example,
Titman and Tiu (2011) regress individual hedge fund returns on several risk factors and
show that hedge funds with low R2 ’s with respect to these factors tend to have higher
Sharpe ratios. On the other hand, Asness, Krail, and Liew (2001) use linear factor models
to show that certain hedge funds that claim to be market neutral are not, containing highly
significant lagged exposure to the S&P 500 which is a symptom of illiquidity (see Section 5).
The usefulness of linear factor models is determined largely by the choice of factors, and
many studies have contributed to our understanding of types of factors that are most relevant
for hedge-fund applications.17 As a result, many linear factor models have been proposed
for hedge funds, and the sheer number of published studies on this topic is a reflection of
the heterogeneity of the hedge-fund industry as well as the complexity and nonlinearity of
the returns that are being approximated by linear models.18 Several authors have suggested
using more easily interpretable factors such as fund characteristics and simple indexes.19
The sensitivity of a fund’s value to a broad-based gauge of asset-class returns in a wellknown category such as stocks is sometimes called “traditional beta”, while the sensitivities
of a fund’s returns to less-well-known factors such as the returns on lookback-straddles
or mechanical carry-trade strategies are often called “exotic betas” or “alternative betas”
(Roncalli and Teiletche (2008)). In recent years a number of ETFs and mutual funds have
launched with the aim of providing investors access to some of these alternative betas (see
Section 6.6).
These methods for selecting easily interpretable factors exhibit varying degrees of success
depending on the nature of the hedge-fund strategies to which they are applied, but they
are generally preferred to purely statistical approaches such as PCA, which Fung and Hsieh
(1997) use to extract factors from the covariance matrix of their sample of 409 hedge funds
17

Examples of linear factor models for hedge funds include Fung and Hsieh (1997, 2002, 2004), Liang
(1999, 2004), Agarwal and Naik (2004), Bondarenko (2004), Chan, Getmansky, Haas, and Lo (2004, 2006,
2007), Bali, Brown, and Caglayan (2011, 2012), and Buraschi, Kosowski, and Trojani (2015).
18
For example, Fung and Hsieh (2001), Mitchell and Pulvino (2001), and Agarwal and Naik (2004) have
empirically documented nonlinear relationships between hedge-fund and market returns, and Lo (1999)
provides a simple analytical example of a nonlinear hedge-fund strategy consisting of shorting out-of-themoney put options on S&P 500 index futures.

and CTAs.
To develop some intuition for linear factor models applied to hedge funds, consider Fung
and Hsieh’s (2001) seven-factor model consisting of bond-trend, currency-trend, commoditytrend, equity-market, size-spread, bond-market, and credit-spread factors.20 The first three
factors are the returns of lookback straddles that capture the idea that trend-following funds
find profit opportunities in large market moves in several asset classes. The equity-market
factor is simply the return of the S&P 500 total return index, while the size-spread factor
is the outperformance of small caps relative to large caps (Russell 2000 vs. S&P 500). The
bond-market factor is the change in yield of the U.S. 10-year bond and is thus inversely
related to returns on an investment in the same. The credit-spread factor is the difference
between the changes in the yield on Baa-rated debt and the yield on U.S. Treasuries. Roughly
speaking, this factor is inversely related to the return on a strategy of buying high yield debt
while shorting U.S. Treasuries.
To illustrate how linear factor models might be used in practice, we regress our set of
average hedge fund category returns on the Fung and Hsieh (2001) seven factors over two
time periods: January 1996 through December 2014 (Table 7) and January 2006 through
December 2014 (Table 10).21 The results in Table 7 suggest that the equity-market, sizespread, and credit-spread factors are linked to the returns of many hedge fund categories.
For example, the “All Single Manager Funds” row suggests that from 1996 through 2014
the average hedge fund portfolio included investments that behaved like stocks (especially
small cap stocks) and high yield debt. The results in Table 7 also suggest that some funds
behaved more idiosyncratically. For example, Managed Futures and Global Macro funds are
associated with investment strategies that rely on currency and commodity straddles, and
Equity Market Neutral funds are associated with a relative value (long small caps, short
large caps) strategy.
Although linear factor models like Fung and Hsieh’s (2001) are able to capture historical
relationships between hedge funds and risk factors, they may not be ideal for practical
purposes such as risk management. In particular, four of the seven factors in Fung and
Hsieh (2001) do not have liquid futures contracts associated with them (the three lookback
straddles and the credit spread); hence, if an investor wishes to reduce exposure to one of
these factors, it would be difficult to do so. Second, the large number of factors increases
the potential for overfitting and, therefore, implies less effective out-of-sample performance.

In contrast, consider a more parsimonious four-factor model that is very nearly investable.
Two factors are the same as in Fung and Hsieh (2001): the equity-market and size-spread
factors, and one is similar: a bond-market factor (we use the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond
Index). We also add an additional factor, 2-to-3 month lagged returns of the S&P 500,
to capture illiquidity exposure, as documented by Asness, Krail, and Liew (2001).22 The
estimates are presented in Table 8. For the average hedge fund, this model has about the
same in-sample R2 as Fung and Hsieh’s (2001) model despite its greater parsimony, though
for specific categories it often falls slightly short for lack of some of the non-investable factors
present in Fung and Hsieh (2001).

While lagged exposure to stocks is not traditionally considered an investable factor, one could, of course,
simply add a corresponding exposure to the S&P 500 to obtain a substantively similar portfolio.

For practical purposes, investors and managers are most interested in forecasting a fund’s
future risks. Accordingly, we also evaluate the funds’ out-of-sample fit for each linear factor
model using a 24-month rolling window and one-month-ahead predictions. The results are
reported in Table 9, which shows that in the out-of-sample period, the simpler model does
a better job for seven of the 10 hedge fund categories. This suggests that, except where
specialized factors dominate a fund’s returns (e.g., the credit spread), the best linear factor
model forecast of a hedge fund’s future risk may be obtained from simpler, investable factors.

the better-performing model is marked in blue.
Table 10 contains conditional risk-adjusted exposures of average hedge fund category
returns to the seven Fung and Hsieh (2001) factors during the period from January 2006
through December 2014. These exposures suggest an interesting difference between the recent nine years and the preceding period: hedge funds no longer have a positive exposure to
the size-spread factor. This implies that, while hedge funds generally maintained their exposure to stocks and the credit spread, on average they stopped holding long small-cap/short
large-cap relative-value positions. Given funds’ historical preference for small-cap stocks,
this change may reflect a significant change within the industry and could be a direction for
further research. This result is supported by Table 11 where, in the context of the four-factor
investable model, hedge funds’ recent exposure to the size-spread factor again is seen to have
dwindled to insignificance or become negative.

Limitations of Hedge-Fund Factor Models

As useful as linear factor models are for capturing the risks and rewards of hedge-fund
returns, these models have their limitations and there are reasons to be cautious in their use:
(i) Correlation vs. causation: The fact that a combination of well-understood factors
may have similar patterns of gains and losses to a given hedge fund does not necessarily
mean that the hedge fund’s strategy is based on those factors. Correlation need not
imply causation, but could be the result of chance, overfitting, or some common latent
factor.
(ii) Approximate fit: A factor model usually explains only part of the hedge funds’
returns, and even that part is typically overfit because of a mismatch between the
explanatory factors and the true contents of the hedge fund portfolio.
(iii) Nonstationarity: Even if a factor model accurately explains a fund’s returns, the
risks associated with every hedge fund change over time, albeit often slowly. So a
factor model rarely predicts the future as well as it explains the past.
(iv) Non-investability: In general, a researcher cannot consider the returns of every
combination of well-understood factors to be an alternative to investing in the indicated
hedge fund, as the factors may not be investable. A combination of factors might not
be investable for many reasons. For example, one cannot invest $1 billion in the
Case-Shiller Atlanta housing index, even though using the index in a factor model
might provide insight into the intrinsic properties of the hedge fund’s portfolio. Even
simple factors like stock market indexes are not entirely investable (though they are
very nearly so) because accessing them incurs commissions, management fees, and/or
tracking error.
Several of these weaknesses are manifest in the following example, which involves two
categories of hedge funds that focus on relative value bets, often using illiquid fixed income
instruments: Fixed Income Arbitrage and Convertible Arbitrage. With a 12-month window,
we use a univariate factor model to estimate the exposure of each category to the S&P 500
index (see Figure 4). At first this is low, as one would expect in strategies like these. But
in the Fall of 2008, the estimated sensitivity of these funds’ returns to those of the S&P 500
spikes dramatically. A naı̈ve interpretation of the results might be that the average fund
manager in both of these categories decided to buy a large quantity of equities. But it seems
unlikely that so many managers of low-volatility relative-value strategies would suddenly
49

boost risk and take directional bets. A more plausible alternative is that, although the
assets in the funds’ portfolios usually exhibit a relatively placid return profile, during the
crisis their prices swung sharply as plunging equity prices forced synchronous fire-sales of
illiquid assets (Khandani and Lo (2007)). This type of synchronized behavior seems to be a
more plausible driver of the covariation reported in Figure 4.

S&P 500 betas from a univariate factor model are graphed.
The most common approach to addressing nonlinearities in hedge-fund returns is to use
factors that exhibit similar kinds of nonlinearities. For example, Fung and Hsieh (2001) create “style factors” that embed option-like characteristics of hedge funds. Similarly, Agarwal
and Naik (2004) propose option-based risk factors consisting of highly liquid at-the-money
and out-of-the-money call and put options for analyzing dynamic risk exposures of hedge
funds. Agarwal and Naik (2004) suggest using piecewise linear models to study market risk
for hedge fund returns. Fung and Hsieh (1997, 2001, 2004) introduce nonlinearity in factor
returns by dividing monthly returns of each asset class (excluding cash) into five “states”
50

to capture trading dynamics of hedge-fund styles. Billio, Getmansky, and Pelizzon (2012)
propose a regime-switching beta model to measure dynamic risk exposures of hedge funds
to various risk factors during different market volatility conditions. Bondarenko (2004) and
Buraschi, Kosowski and Trojani (2015) introduce and analyze variance and correlation risk
factors for hedge funds. Roncalli and Weisang (2010) apply advanced Bayesian filters’ algorithms, known as particle filters, to capture nonlinearities documented in hedge fund returns
(see Section 6.6 for a more detailed discussion in the context of hedge-fund beta replication).
And Patton and Ramadorai (2013) introduce a new econometric methodology to capture
nonlinearities and time-series variation in hedge funds’ exposures to risk factors using highfrequency data, and find that these exposures vary significantly across months. Diez de los
Rios and Garcia (2011) show that nonlinearities are important for some strategies, but not
for the entire hedge-fund industry. Cai and Liang (2012a,b) use rolling-window OLS and
Kalman filtering/smoothing to study non-linearities in hedge fund returns.

6.4

Operational Risks

Due to the complexities of proprietary trading, the lack of transparency, and the lack of
regulatory oversight, hedge funds are especially exposed to operational risk, defined by the
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision as “the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or
failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events”. Feffer and Kundro
(2003) were perhaps the first to call attention to this important source of risk, noting that half
of all hedge-fund failures can be attributed to operational risk alone. They observe that “the
most common operational issues related to hedge fund losses have been misrepresentation of
fund investments, misappropriation of investor funds, unauthorized trading, and inadequate
resources” (Feffer and Kundro, 2003, p. 5). They report that only 6% of their sample
involved inadequate resources, whereas 41% involved misrepresentation of investments, 30%
involved misappropriation of funds, and 14% involved unauthorized trading.
Since then, a number of studies have focused on operational risk. For example, Gupta
and Kazemi (2007) study the failure of the $9 billion hedge fund Amaranth Advisors and
conclude that operational issues were a key factor in this fund’s demise. In a series of
papers, Brown, Goetzmann, Liang, and Schwarz (2008, 2009, and 2012) develop several
quantitative models for measuring operational risk in managed funds. Using a complete and
unique SEC ADV filing dataset, they find that operational risk (represented by past legal or
regulatory problems) is significantly related to the use of leverage, fund ownership structure,
and conflict-of-interest issues. Higher operational risk funds tend to have relatively low
leverage because of strict scrutiny from lenders, more concentrated ownership, and severe
51

conflict-of-interest problems. Through a canonical correlation analysis, they map the ADV
information to the regular fund information such as assets, returns, volatility, fees, leverage,
and share restrictions, which, in turn, they use to construct an omega-score model to predict
future fund performance and attrition. Consistent with the Basel definition, they find that
the higher the omega score, the lower the future performance and the higher the probability
of attrition.
Brown, Goetzmann, Liang, and Schwarz (2012) use finer information on the individual
funds to quantify operational risk. Based on 444 proprietary due diligence reports, they are
able to show that operational risk is directly related to inadequate or failed internal processes,
represented by internal pricing of the portfolio, lack of reliability on reputable auditors and
institutional quality signatures, and frequent misrepresentation of past problems or fund
characteristics. The quantitative model based on these variables sharply predicts future fund
performance and fund disappearance. However, the risk-flow analysis indicates that investors
either ignore the operational risk issues or are ignorant of them, which further validates the
importance of mandatory disclosure of fund information and information verification.
They also find that hedge funds that have experienced legal problems are less likely to use
independent pricing agents and are more likely to have switched pricing agents within the
past year, allowing these hedge funds greater pricing discretion. This discretion is a potential
concern because, as Cassar and Gerakos (2011) show, hedge funds with less verifiable pricing
sources and greater pricing discretion for their managers report smoother returns, resulting
in misleading volatility and Sharpe ratio estimates (see Section 5.1). Bollen and Pool (2012)
link the incidence of SEC lawsuits to suspicious patterns in reported returns, and find that
the discontinuity in a fund’s return distribution (some funds push returns above zero) is a
reliable predictor of subsequent charges of misreporting brought by the SEC.
Ozik and Sadka (2014) argue that hedge funds offer informational advantages to managers
over their clients through fund flows. They demonstrate that fund flows predict returns and
find evidence that managers front-run their clients using this information.
On a more positive note, Brown, Fraser, and Liang (2008) argue that due diligence is an
important source of alpha for diversified hedge fund portfolios. Effective due diligence can
eliminate or reduce problematic funds and avoid future losses resulting from operational risk.
However, due diligence is an expensive process; there is a significant competitive advantage
to sufficiently large funds of funds, which are able to absorb this fixed and necessary cost. In
contrast to hedge funds, the authors find significant economies of scale for funds of funds—the
larger the fund of funds, the better its performance.

6.5

Risk Management

The previous sections’ discussions highlight the fact that hedge funds have more complex and
dynamic risk exposures than traditional investments. Therefore, proper risk management
protocols are essential from both investors’ and managers’ perspectives. The old adage “a
good way to make money is not to lose it in the first place” is particularly relevant for hedge
funds given the active bets they make and the critical role that risk management plays in
generating their returns. Moreover, with reliable estimates of risk exposures from a linear
factor model, it is possible for investors to hedge certain risks that they wish to reduce, and
accentuate other risks that they are especially keen to take on.
This is the motivation for Healy and Lo’s (2009) proposal for hedge-fund investors to
use an overlay strategy consisting of futures contracts on major asset-class indexes such as
stocks, bonds, interest rates, currencies, and commodities so as to actively manage the factor
exposures of their hedge-fund investments (in the interest of full disclosure, two authors of
this survey—P. Lee and A. Lo—have commercial interests in an asset management company
engaged in these overlay strategies). By using these “beta-blockers” in concert with properly
estimated linear factor models, Healy and Lo (2009) argue that investors can reduce or
eliminate exposures that they do not wish to have, while increasing exposures they feel
are more rewarding, and this can be accomplished in a cost-effective manner thanks to
the liquidity and capital efficiency of futures contracts and markets. Black (2006) finds
that adding a small VIX position to an investment portfolio significantly reduces portfolio
volatility due to the negative correlation of VIX to the S&P 500 and most hedge-fund
styles. Even in cases where certain risks simply cannot be managed due to the nature of the
investment, e.g., illiquidity risk in a real estate portfolio, a clear understanding of the risks
will at least allow those exposed to them to prepare accordingly.
Beyond these overlay strategies, risk management is, of course, a well developed discipline
with a broad and deep literature that goes well beyond hedge funds and is impossible to
summarize in a single article, much less a section. However, Lo (2001) focuses on at least
three unique aspects of hedge-fund risk management that are worth reviewing here. The
first is the nonlinear nature of hedge-fund risk exposures, a feature that is not captured by
linear factor models unless specific accommodations are made in defining the factors. A case
in point is the relation between the trend-following strategies of CTAs and the S&P 500
index. A regression of the monthly returns of the CS/DJ Managed Futures Index on those
of the S&P 500 Total Return Index from January 1994 through December 2014 yields the

53

following estimated equation (standard errors in parentheses):
RMF,t = 0.0056 − 0.0546 RSP500,t + ǫt , R2 = 0.0050
(0.0021)

(9)

(0.0486)

which shows that the Managed Futures Index has a positive and statistically significant
alpha of 0.56% per month or 6.8% per year and a slightly negative and insignificant beta of
−0.0546 with respect to the S&P 500. Now decompose the S&P 500 return into its positive
+
−
and negative components, RSP500,t
and RSP500,t
, where:

+
RSP500,t

(10b)

+
.
+ RSP500,t
RSP500,t = RSP500,t

(10c)

A regression of the returns of the Managed Futures Index on these two components yields
the estimate:
+
−
RMF,t = −0.0012 + 0.1454 RSP500,t
− 0.2411 RSP500,t
+ ǫt , R2 = 0.0291
(0.0035)

(0.0937)

(11)

(0.0891)

which tells a very different story about the dynamics of the Managed Futures Index. The
estimated alpha is now insignificant and negative, and the positive and negative betas are
quite different, implying very different behavior in bull vs. bear markets. The beta coefficient
for the positive S&P 500 returns is +0.1454 and statistically indistinguishable from 0, whereas
the beta coefficient for the negative S&P 500 returns is −0.2411 and statistically significant at
the 5% level. This asymmetry implies that when the stock market does well, the Managed
Futures Index bears little relation to stocks, but when the stock market does poorly, the
Managed Futures Index tends to do well, and there is little excess performance beyond these
two components. In the context of the Merton (1981) timing model, this result seems to
suggest that the Managed Futures Index resembles a put-plus-cash strategy. If the risk-free
rate is zero, then the insignificant intercept implies that the manager can deliver this put at
54

zero cost to investors.
Experienced investors in managed futures funds are familiar with this countercyclical pattern of trend-followers, which Kaminski (2011) describes as “crisis alpha”. However, during
extended periods of positive equity-market performance, trend-followers may underperform
relative to their long-term average. For example, in 2012 the compound annual return of the
S&P 500 was 16.0% whereas the return of the Managed Futures Index was −2.9%. These periods of underperformance can cause inexperienced investors to panic and liquidate, largely
eliminating the diversification benefits of such countercyclical investments.
The second unique aspect of hedge-fund returns is tail risk. A classic example is liquidity
provision among strategies that sell more liquid assets and buy less liquid assets of similar
payoffs, a common feature of fixed-income arbitrage funds. Such strategies generate positive
cashflows most of the time since liquid assets are priced higher than their less liquid counterparts, e.g., on-the-run vs. off-the-run U.S. Treasury securities with identical coupons, call
provisions, and other terms. During normal market conditions, these strategies yield very
steady returns—implying high Sharpe ratios—but during periods of market distress, they
can suffer tremendous losses in the face of “flights to safety”. This pattern of mostly positive
small returns punctuated by the occasional large loss characterizes a number of hedge-fund
strategies besides fixed-income arbitrage including equity market neutral strategies, convertible bond arbitrage, high-frequency trading, and catastrophe reinsurance.
Seasoned hedge-fund investors are fully aware of this pattern and are able to withstand
periodic losses so as to capture the full benefits of these strategies. However, less experienced
investors may not be as well prepared, and if they respond by reducing or liquidating their
investments during periods of market distress, they will compound their losses and fail to
profit from the risk premia associated with tail risk exposures.
But perhaps the biggest concern with respect to such strategies is that standard risk
measures will not fully reflect their risks. Lo (2001) provides a simple illustration of a
hypothetical hedge-fund strategy consisting of selling out-of-the-money put options on the
S&P 500 index, which generates a very attractive risk/reward profile as long as the stock
market does not decline by more than the amount that the put option is out of the money.
Sharpe ratios do not reflect tail risk unless a significant loss has occurred within a given fund’s
track record, and when it has, the Sharpe ratio is likely to be misleadingly conservative.
This leads to the third unique aspect of hedge-fund returns which is their tendency
to become highly correlated during times of market distress. To develop intuition for this
aspect, consider the heat map of the empirical distribution of trailing 12-month returns of all
single-manager hedge funds in the Lipper TASS database from 1997 through 2014 in Figure
5. The downward plume of density during the Financial Crisis of 2007–2009 comes in stark
55

contrast to the relatively consistent returns of the previous years. Red and yellow indicate
higher density, while turquoise and blue indicate lower density. For example, the deep
red area during the mid-2000s reflects tightly-clustered performance among hedge funds,
and the subsequent downward plume shows the negative skewness in crisis-period hedge
fund returns. This is followed by another plume—this time upward—that reflects positive
skewness in the cross-sectional distribution of post-crisis hedge fund returns as some funds
profited handsomely as fears abated.

Figure 5: Empirical distribution of the trailing 12-month returns of single-manager hedge

and blue indicate lower density.
A simple way to capture this phenomenon is offered by Lo’s (2001) discrete-time model
of “phase-locking” behavior in which hedge fund i’s returns are given by the following factor

56

model:
Rit = αi + βi Λt + It Zt + ǫit

(12)

where Λt , It , Zt , and ǫit are mutually IID with the following moments:
E[Λt ] = µλ , Var[Λt ] = σλ2
E[Zt ] = 0
E[ǫit ] = 0

, Var[Zt ] = σz2
, Var[ǫit ] = σǫ2i

(13)

and the phase-locking event indicator It is defined as:

It


1 with probability p
=
.
0 with probability p = 1 − p
0

(14)

According to (12), expected returns are driven by three components: the fund’s alpha, αi ,
a “market” component, Λt , to which each fund has its own individual sensitivity, βi , and a
phase-locking component that is identical across all funds at all times, taking only one of
two possible values: 0 (with probability p) or Zt (with probability 1−p).
If we assume that p is small, say 0.001, then most of the time the expected returns of
fund i are determined by αi+βi Λt , but every once in a while an additional term, Zt , appears.
If the volatility, σz , of Zt is much larger than the volatilities of the market factor, Λt , and
the idiosyncratic risk, ǫit , then the common factor, Zt , will dominate the expected returns
of all stocks when It = 1, i.e., phase-locking behavior is present.
Now consider the conditional correlation coefficient of two funds, i and j, defined as
the ratio of the conditional covariance divided by the square root of the product of the
conditional variances, conditioned on It = 0:
βi βj σλ2
Corr[Rit , Rjt | It = 0] = q
q
βi2 σλ2 + σǫ2i βj2 σλ2 + σǫ2j

≈ 0

for βi ≈ βj ≈ 0 (15a)

where we have assumed that βi ≈ βj ≈ 0 to capture the market-neutral characteristic that

many hedge-fund investors desire. Now consider the conditional correlation, conditioned on

57

It = 1:


βi βj σλ2 + σz2
Corr Rit , Rjt | It = 1 = q
q
βi2 σλ2 + σz2 + σǫ2i βj2 σλ2 + σz2 + σǫ2j

q
≈ p
2
2
1 + σǫi /σz 1 + σǫ2j /σz2

for βi ≈ βj ≈ 0 .

(16a)
(16b)

If σz2 is large relative to σǫ2i and σǫ2j , i.e., if the variability of the market-distress component
dominates the variability of the residuals of both funds—a plausible condition that follows
from the very definition of market distress—then (16) will be approximately equal to 1!
When phase-locking occurs, the correlation between funds i and j—close to 0 during normal
times—can become arbitrarily close to 1.
But the most dangerous feature of (12) is the fact that it implies a very small value
for the unconditional correlation, which is the quantity most readily estimated and most
commonly used in risk reports, VaR calculations, and portfolio decisions. To see why, recall
that the unconditional correlation coefficient is simply the unconditional covariance divided
by the product of the square roots of the unconditional variances, hence the unconditional
correlation coefficient under (12) is given by:
βi βj σλ2 + pσz2
Corr[Rit , Rjt ] = q
q
βi2 σλ2 + pσz2 + σǫ2i βj2 σλ2 + pσz2 + σǫ2j
p
q
≈ p
for βi ≈ βj ≈ 0 .
p + σǫ2i /σz2 p + σǫ2j /σz2

(17a)
(17b)

If we let p = 0.001 and assume that the variability of the phase-locking component is 10
times the variability of the residuals, ǫi and ǫj , this implies an unconditional correlation of:
Corr[Rit , Rjt ] ≈

√

p
√
p + 0.1 p + 0.1

= 0.001/.101 = 0.0099

or less than 1%. As the variance, σz2 , of the phase-locking component increases, the unconditional correlation (17) also increases so that eventually, the existence of Zt will have an
impact. However, to achieve an unconditional correlation coefficient of, say, 10%, σz2 would
have to be about 100 times larger than σǫ2 . Without the benefit of an explicit risk model
such as (12), it is virtually impossible to detect the existence of a phase-locking component
58

from standard correlation coefficients.
These considerations suggest that risk management for hedge funds cannot be approached
in the same manner as for traditional investments. Measuring and managing the risk exposures of hedge funds require not only more sophisticated risk analytics, but also a deeper
understanding of the nature of the strategies being managed.

6.6

Hedge-Fund Beta Replication

Our discussion of factor modeling suggests that a portion of hedge funds’ returns may be
attributable to simple investments that do not require hedge funds’ high fees or expensive
trading infrastructure. In recent years the insights of a handful of researchers encouraged
asset managers to develop strategies that generate the “simple” portion of funds’ returns
while charging low fees and providing greater transparency and liquidity. Today billions of
dollars are managed in these strategies. In the interest of full disclosure, two of the authors
of this article—P. Lee and A. Lo—are affiliated with an asset management company offering
a hedge-fund beta replication mutual fund. While every effort has been undertaken to avoid
bias, readers should be aware of this potential conflict of interest and interpret the discussion
in this section accordingly.
Current replication methods fall into three categories: linear factor model replication,
replication of strategies, and replication of payoff functions or return distributions. In the
linear factor model approach, a linear factor model with investable factors is used to construct
a portfolio with the same betas—and corresponding risk premia—of the aggregate hedgefund industry or sector being replicated. Successful linear factor model replication depends
on the explanatory power of the factors and the timeliness of the beta estimates. In the
strategy replication approach, a manager employs a rules-based strategy that aims to make
the same sort of trades that a hedge fund would make and thereby generate similar returns.
One challenge this approach faces is that a fund that trades in a manner similar to a hedge
fund may effectively become a hedge fund itself, and not a replicator at all. Finally, the
distributional approach aims to replicate characteristics of the probability distribution of
hedge-fund returns. The challenge with this approach is that matching payoff distributions
can sometimes be more complex and costly than implementing the hedge-fund strategy itself.
Given the many linear factor models that have been estimated with hedge fund returns
(see Section 6.2), a natural starting point for hedge-fund beta replication is to use these
models to construct portfolios with alternative beta exposures. This is the approach proposed
by Hasanhodzic and Lo (2006, 2007), who constructed “linear clones” of individual hedge
funds in the Lipper TASS hedge fund database using six factors: the U.S. Dollar Index return,
59

the return on the Lehman Corporate AA intermediate Bond Index, the spread between the
Lehman BAA Corporate Bond Index and the Lehman Treasury Index, the S&P 500 total
returns, the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index total return, and the first-difference of the
end-of-month value of the VIX.
Based on these findings, they proposed using liquid futures contracts to construct replication portfolios. This proposal was subsequently implemented by the investment advisory
firm AlphaSimplex Group, LLC in 2008 using just over two dozen futures contracts; the
resulting strategy is currently the largest hedge-fund beta replication mutual fund (see Lee
and Lo (2014) for further discussion). However, Goldman Sachs was the first to market with
a hedge-fund beta replication mutual fund designed to track the Goldman Sachs Absolute
Return Tracker Index. Other large banks and some asset managers have followed suit with
their own versions of hedge-fund beta replication indexes or funds, including Barclays, Credit
Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Index IQ, Merrill Lynch, and Société Générale.
Amenc, Martellini, Meyfredi, and Ziemann (2010) extend Hasanhodzic and Lo (2007)
by assessing the out-of-sample performance of various nonlinear and conditional hedge fund
replication models. They find that going beyond the linear case does not necessarily enhance
replication power, but selecting factors via economic analysis yields substantial improvement
in out-of-sample replication quality, irrespective of the underlying form of the factor model.
Overall, the authors confirm the findings in Hasanhodzic and Lo (2007) that the performance
of replicating strategies is systematically inferior to that of the actual hedge funds, but still
attractive enough to warrant consideration by investors seeking additional sources of risk
premia.
With respect to the replication of hedge-fund payoff distributions, Kat and Palaro (2005,
2006a,b) argue that sophisticated dynamic trading strategies involving liquid futures contracts can replicate many of the statistical properties of hedge-fund returns. The authors
propose several models for the replication of return distribution. More generally, Bertsimas,
Kogan, and Lo (2001) have shown that securities with very general payoff functions (like
hedge funds, or complex derivatives) can be synthetically replicated to an arbitrary degree
of accuracy by dynamic trading strategies—called “epsilon-arbitrage” strategies—involving
more liquid instruments. Although these algorithmic strategies can replicate virtually any
payoff distribution, the complexity of the strategies make this form of replication less attractive to investors that do not have the necessary trading and risk management infrastructure.
A less complex approach to hedge-fund beta replication is to implement “plain vanilla”
versions of certain hedge-fund strategies, specifically those that can be fully described by mechanical trading rules. Examples include the currency carry-trade strategy, trend-following

60

managed futures, risk arbitrage, and a 130/30 long/short equity strategy.23 Investment
products based on these algorithms acknowledge that no manager alpha is contained in their
funds; instead, they seek to provide the corresponding risk premia associated with these
strategies at lower cost and with greater liquidity than their hedge-fund counterparts.
Kazemi, Li, and Tu (2008) develop a replication methodology suited for hedge fund
performance evaluation. The methodology develops two replicating portfolios such that the
distribution properties of the target are matched. The first portfolio delivers the statistical
properties at the lowest possible cost while the other is more expensive but delivers the same
properties as the target. Azlen (2011) combines a core holding of single managers and a
secondary holding of a blend of synthetic replication products to reduce costs and increase
liquidity.
Using Bayesian filters, Roncalli and Weisang (2010) propose solutions for a tracking
problem in hedge fund replication. They find that hedge fund trackers have smaller Sharpe
ratios than their respective indexes, even though they generally exhibit lower volatilities. The
trackers also exhibit a smaller maximum drawdown and kurtosis of the returns. Many illiquid
strategies (e.g., distressed securities), strategies with small betas (e.g., relative value), and
strategies based on stock picking (e.g., merger arbitrage and equity market neutral) present
low correlation with their respective trackers, and thus are hard to replicate. Interestingly,
for funds of funds the authors find that a replicating portfolio does not have a high correlation
with its respective index, but still exhibits similar performance.
Finally, Tuchschmid, Wallerstein, and Zaker (2010) survey 21 replication funds and indexes from April 2008 to May 2009. They find that these replication products are sold at a
far lower fee level than hedge funds, and that many of them seem to live up to their promise
of low correlation with market indexes. All of them underperformed during the Financial
Crisis of 2007–2009, but so did hedge funds over this period. As a result, the authors conclude that, benchmarked against hedge-fund indexes, many replication products perform
well.

The Financial Crisis

No review of the hedge fund literature would be complete without some discussion of the
impact of the Financial Crisis of 2007–2009 on the hedge-fund industry as well as the industry’s role in the crisis, issues that are both nuanced and important from all stakeholders’

perspectives. If hedge funds are the “tip of the spear” in exploiting profitable opportunities
during good times, they are also the “canary in the coal mine” that suffers first during bad
times.
Figure 5 shows that the recent crisis has had an unprecedented effect on the industry.
While some funds were able to profit handsomely from these adverse market conditions,
about 70% of the funds in our sample experienced negative returns in 2008. Losses suffered
by funds invested in illiquid assets such as credit were particularly disproportionate to those
funds’ typical volatility levels. As the crisis began, reports of “10-sigma” or “20-sigma”
events were commonplace until a sort of ennui set in, and it became understood that models designed to characterize the behavior of asset prices during normal market conditions
had little relevance in a crisis so extreme that the need to survive trumped many financial
institutions’ normal profit-seeking behaviors.
In the face of heavy losses and investor redemptions, a record number of funds shut down,
and for the first time in the industry’s modern history the number of funds began to decline
(see Table 3). Moreover, these losses led many investors to re-evaluate the significance of
supposedly well-understood concepts such as diversification and absolute return strategies.
Hedge fund managers rushing to exit from crowded trades found that once-diversifying positions were now highly correlated, and many suffered acute losses. However, in a recent study,
Reca, Sias, and Turtle (2013) find that hedge fund trades are not very crowded, subject to
the limitations of 13F data. Managers whose portfolios survived the mayhem were often
more agile, more liquid, more tactical, and more contrarian, e.g., Managed Futures, Global
Macro, Dedicated Short Bias funds, and funds with less autocorrelated returns.
Although many hedge funds were unsuspecting victims of the Financial Crisis of 2007–
2009, several studies have considered the possibility that hedge funds played a significant
role in causing the crisis. Ever since the demise of LTCM in 1998, hedge funds have become
inextricably linked to systemic risk, though the links are still not yet well defined. A 2011
survey conducted by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) of more than 170 hedge
funds encompassing over $1.1 trillion in assets as of early 2010 found that hedge funds were
one of the largest purchasers of the riskiest equity tranches of collateralized debt obligation
(CDO) securities. More than half of the equity tranches were purchased by hedge funds
that simultaneously shorted other tranches, thus engaging in a correlation trade. However,
many hedge funds also used credit default swaps (CDSs) to take offsetting positions in
different tranches of the same CDO security. Therefore, hedge funds would profit if the
CDOs performed, but stood to earn even more if the entire market crashed (FCIC (2011)).
By being positioned to benefit from financial instability, hedge funds had an incentive to
increase systemic risk.
62

The crisis underscored the need for regulators to obtain greater transparency from hedge
funds so as to gauge the potential systemic risks posed by certain strategies such as the
correlation trade, to keep track of crowded trades (which could be vulnerable to runs such as
the August 2007 Quant Meltdown and the more opaque runs on mortgage-linked products),
to evaluate liquidity risks, etc. In 2012, the SEC began collecting confidential hedge-fund
data via Form PF. Regulators now have access to limited aggregate results about hedge-fund
positions, exposures, leverage, the use of derivatives, and different types of risks (SEC (2013)
and OFR (2013)).
Moreover, because hedge funds do lie outside the purview of banking supervision despite
the fact that they now engage in many of the same businesses as banks, they could pose
unique risks to financial stability that are more difficult to measure and manage in the current
regulatory framework. Although several industry leaders have argued that the hedge-fund
industry is simply not large enough to have an impact on financial stability, the experience
of LTCM—a hedge fund with only $4.7 billion in assets just prior to August 1998—seems
to suggest otherwise. But even if the hedge-fund industry played only a supporting role
in the most recent crisis, as the empirical evidence suggests, its unconstrained and dynamic
investment strategies can certainly facilitate both the build-up of systemic risk during periods
of market exuberance and the propagation of systemic shocks during periods of market
dislocation.
In fact, contributions to systemic risk may be an unavoidable consequence of the provision
of market liquidity and price discovery during normal market conditions. Although often
criticized as being part of the opaque “shadow banking system”, hedge funds also played a
critical role in supporting the economy when the official banking system ground to a halt
in 2007–2009. For example, of the eight investment funds created jointly by the private
sector and the U.S. Treasury as part of its Public-Private Investment Program (PPIP) to
purchase “troubled assets”, i.e., mortgage-backed securities, from banks so as to allow them
to start lending again, two were co-sponsored by hedge funds (Angelo, Gordon & Co. and
Oaktree),24 and many of the investors in all eight funds were hedge-fund investors. Hedge
funds and their investors are central to the financial ecosystem in providing much-needed
capital, particularly during times when typical investors are fleeing to safety.
Whether it is possible to keep the benefits that hedge funds offer while eliminating the
potential risks they pose is still an open question. But even if this is not possible, monitoring
the hedge-fund industry is essential for developing an accurate map of risk-taking activity
24

Incidentally, these two funds earned the highest net internal rates of return for their investors among
the eight: 26.3% for the Oaktree PPIP Fund, L.P. and 24.8% for the AG GECC PPIF Master Fund, L.P.
from inception to end (U.S. Treasury, 2013).

in the economy, and may also yield early warning signs of impending financial distress. This
latter objective is the focus of Section 7.1 which contains a summary of the literature on
early indications of the Financial Crisis of 2007–2009 among a subset of hedge funds. We
then turn to a more systematic accounting of the hedge-fund winners and losers during the
crisis period in Section 7.2, and summarize the post-crisis performance of hedge funds in
Section 7.3. Finally, in Section 7.4 we review the subset of the burgeoning systemic risk
literature that involves the hedge-fund industry.

7.1

Early Warning Signs of the Crisis

Most of the public first became aware of the recent financial crisis during the fourth quarter of
2008 when Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and the Reserve Primary Fund “broke the
buck”. However, well before 2008, early warning signs of the crisis emerged in three distinct
but interrelated sectors—U.S. residential real estate, banking, and hedge funds—and were
highlighted by several academics. In January 2005, Shiller (2005) published excerpts from
his new edition of Irrational Exuberance in Money Magazine in which he warned of an
asset bubble in the U.S. housing market. In August 2005, Rajan (2005) presented research
showing that recent financial innovations had increased risk in the banking sector. And at
an October 2004 conference organized by the National Bureau of Economic Research on
systemic risk, Chan, Getmansky, Haas, and Lo (2004) first presented their empirical findings
of an increased probability of a systemic shock in the hedge-fund industry due to significant
losses among large, leveraged, hedge funds investing in illiquid securities (see, also, their
published versions, Chan, Getmansky, Haas, and Lo (2006, 2007)).
Chan, Getmansky, Haas, and Lo (2004) based their inferences on several indirect measures including: asset-weighted return autocorrelations that pointed to greater reliance on
illiquid assets (see Section 5); regime-switching models that pointed to lower expected returns, higher volatility, and, therefore, greater use of leverage; and increasing common-factor
exposures in individual hedge-fund returns, implying higher conditional correlations when
market indexes crash (see Section 6). In September 2005, the New York Times published a
story about this research and concluded that “The nightmare script . . . would be a series
of collapses of highly leveraged hedge funds that bring down the major banks or brokerage
firms that lend to them” (Gimein (2005)). Such an outcome seemed absurd at the time, but
the losses that brought down Bear Stearns—a company founded in 1923 with assets of $350
billion, over 13,500 employees, and record net revenues of $9.2 billion in 2006—began with
their two subprime mortgage hedge funds: the Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit
Fund and the Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit Enhanced Leveraged Fund.
64

With the benefit of hindsight, these three different warning signs, generated by three
very different sources, were manifestations of the very same forces at play in the economy.
Real estate prices were being driven to unprecedented levels by tremendous inflows of assets
from around the world via both the banking system and capital markets, thanks to financial
innovations such as securitization and the CDS. And because hedge funds are largely unconstrained in their investment mandates and trading style, stress fractures in the financial
system are more likely to show up first in the hedge-fund industry. Their aggressive risk
appetite and incentive to generate absolute return cause them to be first to take advantage
of emerging investment opportunities, and also the first to take losses when crisis hits. In
fact, signs of credit problems were visible in the hedge-fund industry as early as May 2005
when convertible arbitrage funds suffered extraordinary losses in the aftermath of the downgrading of General Motors and Ford corporate debt to “non-investment-grade” status by the
rating agencies. The two automakers had over $450 billion of debt outstanding, all of which
turned to junk bonds overnight.
These downgrades were emblematic of a broader deterioration of credit quality throughout debt markets, wreaking havoc with highly leveraged financial institutions and many of
their counterparties. Like a flu pandemic in the age of international air travel, the credit crisis spread quickly around the globe, occasionally erupting in unexpected venues. One of the
most unexpected venues was a little-known corner of the hedge-fund industry called equity
market neutral or “statistical arbitrage” funds. During the first four days of the second week
of August 2007, these highly quantitative equity trading funds all experienced significant
losses at the same time, for no apparent reason, and then on the last day of that week, they
experienced dramatic reversals. The press dubbed this episode the “Quant Meltdown of
August 2007” but offered no explanation for what had happened—hedge funds do not talk
to the press.
In attempt to piece together this puzzling sequence of events, Khandani and Lo (2007)
combined inferences from Lipper TASS hedge-fund data and simulations of a specific equity
market neutral trading strategy using historical stock returns from January 1995 through
September 2007 and reproduced the huge losses in August 2007. From these simulations,
they developed a hypothetical narrative to explain the Quant Meltdown: the losses were
initiated by the rapid “unwind” of one or more sizable quantitative equity market-neutral
portfolios, likely a forced liquidation stemming from a margin call or a desire to cut risk,
given the speed and price impact with which this unwind occurred. These initial losses
then put pressure on other equity market neutral funds which, by definition, are engaged in

65

similar strategies and, therefore, hold similar portfolios,25 causing further losses by triggering
stop/loss and deleveraging policies. This is one of the clearest examples of Brunnermeier’s
(2009) margin and deleveraging spirals.26 Adrian and Shin (2008, 2010) document a procyclical relationship between the leverage of U.S. investment banks and the sizes of their
balance sheets and explore the aggregate effects that such a relationship can have on asset
prices and the volatility risk premium. This empirical observation increases the likelihood
of Brunnermeier’s (2009) margin and deleveraging spiral. Allen and Carletti (2008) provide
a more detailed analysis of the role of liquidity in the financial crisis and consider the source
of the current “cash-in-the-market” pricing, i.e., market prices that are significantly below
what plausible fundamentals would suggest.
A significant rebound of these strategies occurred on August 10th, presumably in response
to an announced injection of capital into one of the hardest-hit funds, Goldman Sachs’s
Global Equity Opportunities Fund. But another factor that may have contributed to the
reversal on the 10th was the overnight liquidity injection by the major central banks into
short-term interbank lending markets in response to the so-called “run on repo” on August
9th (see Gorton and Metrick (2012)).
The research departments of the major investment banks also produced analyses, e.g.,
Goldman Sachs Asset Management (2007) and Rothman (2007a,b,c), citing coordinated
losses among portfolios constructed according to several well-known quant factors, and arguing that simultaneous deleveraging and a lack of liquidity were responsible for these losses.
For example, the study by Rothman (2007a), which was first released on August 9, 2007,
reports the performance of a number of quant factors and attributes the simultaneous bad
performance to “a liquidity based deleveraging phenomena”. Goldman Sachs Asset Management (2007) provides additional evidence from foreign equity markets (Japan, U.K., and
Europe-ex-U.K.), indicating that the unwinds involved more than just U.S. securities. In
a follow-up study, Rothman (2007b) called attention to the perils of endogenous risk; in
referring to the breakdown of the risk models during that period, he concluded that: “By
and large, they understated the risks as they were not calibrated for quant managers/models
25

In particular, Khandani and Lo (2011a) simulate simple equity market neutral strategies using five factors
commonly used in quantitative equity trading strategies—three value-factors similar to those in Lakonishok,
Shleifer, and Vishny (1994), and two momentum factors as in Chan, Jegadeesh, and Lakonishok (1996)—and
show that funds began unwinding portfolios constructed with these factors as early as the beginning of July
2007.
26
Although Brunnermeier’s (2009) focus was on mortgage-related losses, his argument applies verbatim to
the Quant Meltdown. In both cases, the amplification mechanism is key: borrowers’ deteriorating balance
sheets generate liquidity spirals from relatively small shocks, and once started, these spirals continue as lower
asset prices and higher volatility raise margin levels and lower available leverage.

66

becoming our own asset class, creating our own contagion”.27 And, most recently, Litterman (2013) provides a fascinating personal account of these events as he witnessed them
firsthand as a partner at Goldman Sachs during August 2007.28 His analysis of the Quant
Meltdown is both riveting and intellectually stimulating, and should be required viewing for
all hedge-fund managers, investors, and financial regulators.
In its conclusion, the Goldman Sachs Asset Management (2007) study suggests that
“. . .it is not clear that there were any obvious early warning signs. . . No one, however,
could possibly have forecasted the extent of deleveraging or the magnitude of last week’s
factor returns”. Using transactions data from July through September 2007, Khandani
and Lo (2011a) show that the dislocation was exacerbated by the withdrawal of market
making risk capital—possibly by high-frequency hedge funds—starting on August 8. This
highlights the endogenous nature of liquidity risk and the degree of interdependence among
market participants, or “species” in the terminology of Farmer and Lo (1999). The fact that
the ultimate origins of this dislocation were apparently outside the equity market neutral
sector—most likely in a completely unrelated set of markets and instruments—suggests that
the financial system is much more highly interconnected and tightly coupled than previously
recognized.

7.2

Winners and Losers

During periods of financial distress, hedge funds have often suffered larger losses than traditional risk-assessment methods have predicted. A number of authors have investigated this
curious phenomenon and have pointed to the potential impact of latent factors (see Section
6), with illiquidity being the most significant. The prices of illiquid assets often plummet
during market dislocations in response to forced liquidations that result in fire-sales, generating losses for all entities invested in illiquid assets. As can be seen in Figure 6, funds with the
highest autocorrelated returns—an indication of illiquidity (see Section 5.1)—underperform
during periods of market stress. More directly, Billio, Getmansky, and Pelizzon (2013) estimate the latent factor present in hedge fund returns during the 1998 and 2007–2009 financial
crises, and find that this factor is connected to funding and asset liquidity. Cao, Liang, Lo,
and Petrasek (2014) conclude that hedge fund trading increases market efficiency in general. However, during crises, hedge funds face leverage-induced margin calls and liquidity
squeezes hence their trading leads to greater price deviations from fundamentals during these
episodes. Therefore, the positive role of hedge funds in improving market efficiency critically

depends on funding liquidity. Figure 6 highlights three crises: the Russian debt default and
LTCM’s collapse (1998), the automakers’ bond downgrade (2005), and the recent financial
crisis (2007–2009). During each of these periods of stress, highly autocorrelated funds underperformed their more liquid peers. In “normal” years, however, illiquid funds generally
appear to be the outperformers (Aragon (2007) and Sadka (2010, 2012)). In fact, less liquid
funds outperformed others in 2009, perhaps driven by a rebound in the prices of illiquid
assets.

groups from the Lipper TASS database: the most liquid (lowest autocorrelation), mediumliquid (medium autocorrelation), and the least liquid (highest autocorrelation). Returns are
calculated yearly for each liquidity group from January 1996 through December 2014.
In 2008 the Financial Crisis was at its most intense, though equity markets continued
to decline until mid-March of 2009. Although hedge funds earned positive returns in 2007
and 2009 on average, the combination of plunging equity markets and evaporating liquidity
68

in 2008 proved toxic and, in many cases fatal, leading to the industry’s worst-ever annual
return and the shutdown of over 2,000 hedge funds, as documented in Table 3. In 2008, the
attrition rate was 21%, the average hedge fund return was −18.4%, and the proportion of
hedge fund managers reporting negative returns for the year was 71%. Critics of the industry
asked why these absolute-return funds failed to generate positive returns, while supporters

noted that an investor would have fared far better in the average hedge fund than in, for
example, a stock index fund.
Lehman Brothers acted as one of the major prime brokers to the hedge-fund industry
prior to its bankruptcy on September 15, 2008. Aragon and Strahan (2012) study an example
of the propagation of illiquidity during the financial crisis: Lehman and the hedge funds that
used it as a prime broker. They document that the failure rate of Lehman’s hedge-fund clients
doubled after the bankruptcy, relative to funds with similar performance characteristics using
other brokers. The authors also show that stocks held by Lehman’s hedge-fund clients prior
to the bankruptcy experienced unexpectedly large declines in liquidity after the bankruptcy.
Ben-David, Franzoni, and Moussawi (2012) show that in 2008Q3–Q4, hedge funds sold about
29% of their aggregate portfolio. Redemptions and margin calls were the primary drivers
of the selloffs. In comparison, fund outflows and stock sales for mutual funds were not as
severe.
The remainder of 2009 was marked by the sharp appreciation of depressed asset prices
as governments flooded the markets with liquidity. 2010 saw a continued, albeit uneven,
recovery and the development of the European sovereign debt crisis. Hedge fund attrition,
though still in double digits, decreased to 15% in 2009 and 2010, and average hedge-fund
returns were positive in both years. Although hedge funds in most categories experienced
losses during 2008, those in three categories did not (see Table 12). As one would expect
in a declining equity market, Dedicated Short Bias produced handsome returns. Managed
Futures, an investment style that makes heavy use of trend-following, also performed well.
Indeed, one of the primary motivations for investing in managed futures funds is their performance during and after crises, i.e., Kaminski’s (2011) crisis alpha. However, Global
Macro—the more-discretionary counterpart to Managed Futures that does not have as much
crisis alpha—finished the year roughly flat. Table 13 shows that funds belonging to these
three categories exhibited the lowest autocorrelation and lowest correlation with the S&P
500 during this period, which supports the narrative that the evaporation of liquidity and
the decline in the prices of equities or equity-like investments played an important role in
hedge funds’ losses.

Post-Crisis Performance

In the years following the financial crisis, some industry analysts have expressed disappointment with hedge funds in light of their underperformance relative to public equities. As a
result, investors’ ever-present interest in gauging manager alpha has a new and urgent form:
in the post-crisis era, have hedge funds lost their ability to generate attractive returns? Although it is still too soon to answer this question with any degree of empirical accuracy,
some preliminary facts suggest a possible response.
In Table 14 we report summary statistics for the returns of the average hedge fund during pre- and post-crisis periods, where the pre-crisis period is from January 1996 through
December 2006 and the post-crisis period is from January 2010 through December 2014. In
each period, we calculate the bias-adjusted average monthly returns for single-fund managers in the Lipper TASS database, along with the other standard measures of investment
performance. The entries confirm the popular perception that the absolute returns of hedge
funds were higher on average during the pre-crisis period: 8.7% pre-crisis vs. 4.2% post-crisis.
Moreover, this inequality holds for every single category.
However, Table 14 also shows that, in the post-crisis period, the Sharpe ratios of hedge
funds have been as high as they were in the pre-crisis period or higher, suggesting that
managers are no less skilled at generating returns now than they were before the crisis.
Specifically, across all categories, the average Sharpe ratio is 0.72 in the pre-crisis period
and 1.00 in the post-crisis period. As a check, we calculated the Sharpe ratio of the CS/DJ
Hedge-Fund Index for the same periods, and again we found that the Sharpe ratio had, if
anything, increased: 0.97 in the pre-crisis period and 1.29 in the post-crisis period. This
result is hardly definitive, as the length of the post-crisis period is still rather short and many
authors have proposed more-elaborate measures of hedge fund skill. Nonetheless, it suggests
that any reports of the disappearance of hedge fund manager skill may be quite exaggerated.
This surprising result suggests a somewhat different narrative regarding the source of
hedge-fund underperformance. The most obvious explanation is the fact that the average
volatility of hedge funds’ returns was lower in the post-crisis period, damping absolute returns
even as risk-adjusted returns remained strong. We estimate that the annualized volatility
of the cross-sectionally averaged hedge fund returns in the Lipper TASS database dropped
from 6.5% to 4.2% between the two periods, and among the individual categories, only
Convertible Arbitrage funds have higher average volatilities in the post-crisis period. This
decline in volatility is likely due to lower amounts of leverage being deployed in the hedge-fund
industry for several reasons: a decrease in risk appetite among investors in the aftermath of
the financial crisis, more stringent capital requirements on the part of regulators, and fewer

Table 14: Summary statistics for the pre- and post-crisis returns of the average hedge fund
in each Lipper TASS style category, including number of fund months, annualized mean,
annualized volatility, Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, skewness, kurtosis, maximum drawdown,
correlation coefficient with the S&P 500, first-order autocorrelation, and p-value of the LjungBox Q-statistic with three lags. The pre-crisis period is from January 1996 through December
2006 and the post-crisis period is from January 2010 through December 2014. Sharpe and
Sortino ratios are adjusted for the three-month U.S. Treasury Bill rate. The “All Single
Manager Funds” category includes the funds in all 10 main Lipper TASS categories and any
other single-manager funds present in the database (relatively few) while excluding funds of
funds.

market opportunities due to central banking interventions that have changed traditional
risk/reward relations among assets.
This potential decrease in leverage is related to the second possible source of apparent
underperformance of post-crisis hedge funds: a lower risk-free rate. We estimate that the
average risk-free rate declined from 3.80% in the pre-crisis period to 0.07% in the post-crisis
period. If hedge funds earn a portion of their return from cash holdings, e.g., as collateral in
margin accounts, their post-crisis returns will definitely be affected by the low-interest-rate
policies of the world’s major central banks, irrespective of manager skill.
Third, hedge-fund database biases are much stronger for older data (see Section 3.2).
A researcher who naı̈vely averaged pre-crisis returns in the Lipper TASS database might
introduce an upward bias of 8.6%, whereas post-crisis average returns may only be subject
to a 1.9% bias. Unless these biases are corrected before averaging (as we do in this review
article), they will tend to exaggerate the difference between pre- and post-crisis hedge-fund
returns.
These three factors are sufficient to explain the entirety of the post-crisis underperformance of hedge funds. However, it is still too early to judge whether any or all of these
explanations are, in fact, correct. More data must be accumulated before we can come to a
definitive conclusion, and these hypotheses provide specific guidelines for the kinds of data
that need to be collected.

7.4

Hedge Funds and Systemic Risk

In the aftermath of the Financial Crisis of 2007–2009, the concept of “systemic risk” has
emerged as an important phenomenon that goes far beyond its original domain of macroeconomics and central banking policy. Although a review of the systemic risk literature is
beyond the scope of this article, the extent to which the hedge-fund industry can offer insights
into systemic risk is clearly within our purview.
A natural starting point for developing such insights is to first define and then measure
systemic risk—the adage that “one cannot manage what one does not measure” is particularly relevant in this context. Remarkably, five years after one of the worst financial crises
since the Great Depression of 1929, we still do not have a consensus on the definition of
systemic risk, much less a standardized measure for it. In fact, the review article on systemic risk measures published in this journal by Bisias, Flood, Lo, and Valavanis (2012) lists
31 distinct measures, not one of which is universally endorsed as the canonical measure of
systemic risk that should be regularly computed and released by the government. And even
after reviewing eight centuries of financial crises, Reinhart and Rogoff’s (2009) definitive
74

treatise offers no single barometer with which financial stability can be reliably gauged.
Billio, Getmansky, Lo, and Pelizzon (2012) define systemic risk as the risk of a “systemic
event”, which is any set of circumstances that threatens the stability of or public confidence
in the financial system. This is consistent with the “four L’s” of financial crisis—liquidity,
leverage, linkages, and losses—that appear repeatedly in various narratives of 2007–2009,
and all of these L’s touch the hedge-fund industry to some extent. Under this definition,
there is little doubt that LTCM’s decline in August and September of 1998 was a systemic
event, and that the private-sector bailout facilitated by the New York Fed was a reasonable, if
somewhat hastily arranged, response. However, in September 2006 when the much larger ($9
billion vs. $4.7 billion) hedge fund Amaranth Advisors shut down because of extreme trading
losses, there was no Fed-facilitated bail out and financial markets hardly noticed. Clearly this
event was not systemic, and the comparison with LTCM underscores the heterogeneity and
complexity of the hedge-fund industry, and the need for more refined analytics to determine
how hedge funds may or may not affect systemic risk.
In a series of papers, Chan, Getmansky, Haas, and Lo (2004, 2006, 2007) propose using the
hedge-fund industry like a geiger counter to construct measures of systemic risk. Employing
aggregate measures of volatility, illiquidity, and financial distress for hedge funds based on
statistical regime-switching models, autocorrelation, and linear factor exposures, they show
that periods of market dislocation can be predicted to some degree by certain trends in the
hedge-fund industry such as regime switches to lower-mean/higher-volatility returns, and
increases in illiquidity as measured by asset-weighted autocorrelations.29
More recently, Billio, Getmansky, Lo, and Pelizzon (2012) have proposed measures of
interconnectedness among four types of financial institutions that figured prominently in the
recent financial crisis: banks, broker/dealers, insurance companies, and hedge funds. Using
monthly returns for the top 25 institutions in each of these four categories, they estimate common factor exposures using PCA, and estimate pairwise connections using Granger-causality
tests. The former technique captures concentrated sources of risk and return across the four
sectors, and the latter is used to construct Granger-causality networks, directed graphs that
capture both the direction and statistical significance of pairwise relations among financial
institutions over time. By applying standard measures of connectivity from social network
analysis such as the eigenvector centrality parameter, they conclude that the banking and insurance sectors are particularly important sources of interconnectedness and, therefore, key
channels through which systemic events are propagated. Hedge funds are also important
nodes in this financial web, but they do not play as large a role in transmitting systemic
29

Regime-switching models are commonly used in the broader financial economics literature, e.g., Bekaert
and Harvey (1995), Ang and Bekaert (2002) and Guidolin and Timmermann (2008) among others.

75

shocks as banks.30 A distinct literature focusing on the reverse question—how does systemic
risk affect hedge funds?—has developed in parallel. Brunnermeier (2009) argues that hedge
funds could be affected by financial crises through many mechanisms: direct exposure, funding liquidity, market liquidity, loss and margin spirals, runs on hedge funds, and aversion to
Knightian uncertainty. Some of these mechanisms, like direct exposure and market liquidity,
can be captured by hedge fund exposures to market risk factors.
Billio, Getmansky, and Pelizzon (2013) find that liquidity, credit, equities, and equitymarket volatility are common risk factors during crises for various hedge-fund strategies.They
apply a novel methodology to identify the presence of a common latent risk-factor exposure
across all hedge-fund strategies, and find that this latent factor is related to asset and funding
liquidity. If the latent risk factor is omitted in risk modeling, the resulting effect of financial
crises on hedge fund risk is greatly underestimated. These results support the conclusions
of Boyson, Stahel, and Stulz (2010), who document significant contagion from lagged bankand broker-returns to hedge-fund returns.
Other factors such as funding liquidity, margin spirals, runs on hedge funds, and aversion
to Knightian uncertainty are hedge-fund-specific and affect the residual volatility of hedge
fund returns (Krishnamurthy (2010)). For example, Khandani and Lo (2007, 2011a) argue
that a forced liquidation of a given strategy should increase the strategy volatility through
the increase in the residual volatility of hedge fund returns. Billio, Getmansky, and Pelizzon
(2013) investigate residual volatility of hedge-fund strategies and show that the increase in
this volatility is common among all hedge-fund strategies they consider during the LTCM
crisis of 1998 and the Financial Crisis of 2007–2009.
Chan, Getmansky, Haas, and Lo (2004, 2006, 2007), Adrian (2007), and Khandani and
Lo (2007, 2011a) show that hedge funds’ risk profile during the LTCM crisis was drastically
different from other financial crises. Khandani and Lo (2007, 2011a) find an increased
correlation among hedge-fund styles in this period and conjecture that this can be due to
the increase in systematic linkages with market factors, liquidity, and credit proxies, e.g., the
Quant Meltdown of August 2007 (see Section 7.1). Boyson, Stahel, and Stulz (2010) study
potential explanations for the clustering of hedge funds’ worst returns and find that adverse
shocks to asset and funding liquidity as well as contagion may potentially explain this tail
risk.
Despite the fact that dislocation in the hedge-fund industry often presages broader fi30

The role of hedge funds in financial crises has been documented in several studies, including Eichengreen,
Mathieson, Chadha, Jansen, Kodres, and Sharma (1998), Brown, Goetzmann, and Park (2000), Fung, Hsieh,
and Tsatsoronis (2000), Brunnermeier and Nagel (2004), and Chen and Liang (2007). Hedge fund failures
and liquidations, and their underlying causes, have also been studied, e.g., Getmansky, Lo, and Mei (2004)
and Liang and Park (2010).

76

nancial crises, it is easy to miss or ignore these early warning signs. Although academic
studies raised the possibility of crisis as early as 2004 and 2005 (see Chan, Getmansky, Haas,
and Lo (2004), Rajan (2005), Shiller (2005), and Section 7.1), these were outliers with respect to the financial industry’s perspective at the time. A sense for the magnitude of the
gulf between academia and industry can be obtained from the views of the Counterparty
Risk Management Policy Group II (CRMPG-II) (2005), a non-profit industry consortium
with the following mandate: “The primary purpose of CRMPG-II—building on the 1999
report of CRMPG-I—is to examine what additional steps should be taken by the private
sector to promote the efficiency, effectiveness and stability of the global financial system”.
The CRMPG-II was chaired by Gerald Corrigan, then a managing director at Goldman
Sachs, and the two vice chairs were Don Wilson, then Chief Risk Officer of JP Morgan,
and David Bushnell, then senior risk officer of Citigroup. The other members of the policy group included senior representatives from top financial institutions and their law firms:
Bear Stearns, Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, Deutsche Bank, General Motors Asset
Management, HSBC, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, TIAA-CREF, and
Tudor Investment Corporation. On July 25, 2005, this body of industry experts published
their report which began with the following summary assessment (CRMPG-II (2005, p. 1)):
In approaching its task, the Policy Group shared a broad consensus that the
already low statistical probabilities of the occurrence of truly systemic financial
shocks had further declined over time.
While this statement may seem naı̈ve with the benefit of hindsight, it must be emphasized
that business was booming during this period, with many of the firms represented in the
CRMPG-II earning record profits that year and the year after. However, even in this context,
the CRMPG-II report contains some prescient warnings that the members both documented
and then dismissed with their blanket assessment. Recommendations 12, 21, and 22 of the
report called for industry-wide efforts to: (1) cope with serious “back-office” and potential
settlement problems in the CDS market; and (2) stop the practice whereby some market
participants “assign” their side of a trade to another institution without the consent of the
original counterparty to the trade.31 The first recommendation was for the largest institutions to catch up on the one-year backlog in simply entering into their record-keeping and,
presumably, their risk-management systems, the terms of CDS contracts they had executed.
The second recommendation was to address the fact that a number of CDS contracts could
legally be reassigned to other counterparties without prior approval or notification, making

77

it virtually impossible to determine the counterparty credit risk of such contracts.32 These
recommendations seem grossly inconsistent with the CRMPG-II’s conclusion that the risk
of a systemic shock had declined.
This example highlights the challenges that the financial industry faces in identifying
threats to financial stability; such threats are often forged in the crucible of highly profitable, rapidly growing business lines. Unless corporate executives have perfect timing, it is
unrealistic to expect them to reduce risk as their businesses are expanding, nor will shareholders support such behavior. While the concept of countercyclical capital buffers seems
sensible, it is virtually impossible for them to be self-imposed by the industry. Therefore,
macroprudential regulation can play a positive role in creating a more stable and robust
financial system.

Implementation Issues for Hedge Fund Investing

Having reviewed much of the academic hedge-fund literature in Sections 2–7, we now turn to
four implementation issues facing hedge-fund investors. In Section 8.1, we consider the potential dangers of mindlessly applying traditional mean-variance portfolio analysis to hedge
fund returns. The multi-faceted nature of hedge-fund risk exposures, the smoothness of
certain hedge-fund returns due to illiquidity, and the nonstationarity of their return distributions imply that standard mean-variance analysis can yield highly misleading portfolio
allocations, especially at the asset-class level.
A related problem is discussed in Section 8.2 involving the potential over-diversification
of hedge-fund portfolios, which can lead to lower expected returns and, surprisingly, greater
risks. The investment implications of adding hedge funds to a portfolio of traditional assets
are discussed in Section 8.3. Given the potential pitfalls in hedge-fund investing, the need
for a more systematic framework for making alternative investment decisions is clear and in
Section 8.4 we present such a framework.
From a broader perspective, investing in hedge funds seems at odds with much of the
academic investments literature which emphasizes passive risk premia and dismisses the
possibility of consistent sources of alpha. However, the popularity of hedge funds among large
institutional investors who also invest passively suggests a troubling contradiction between
theory and practice. In Section 8.5, we provide a review of the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis,
an alternative to the Efficient Markets Hypothesis that reconciles this contradiction in an
32

Both of these problems were not isolated issues, but were so widespread that eventually Timothy Geithner, then president of the New York Fed, was motivated to intervene through moral suasion to get the
financial industry to address these concerns.

78

intellectually satisfying manner.

8.1

The Limits of Mean-Variance Optimization

A common question facing investors, advisers, and institutional money managers is how
much should they allocate to hedge funds? Many turn to mathematical optimization tools
only to discover that their optimizer recommends a 200% allocation to hedge funds and
−100% allocation to other assets. Such results are usually disregarded, and rightly so. While
hedge funds may be desirable investments for some investors, biases in hedge fund reporting
artificially boost historical estimates of expected returns while autocorrelation due to illiquid
portfolios artificially dampens estimated variances and covariances. Furthermore, optimizers
may produce recommendations that are fine-tuned for a previous period but poorly suited
for the future, and the resulting portfolios may have unsuitable risk characteristics.
In Table 15 we show that a (nearly) unconstrained optimizer can produce a portfolio
that would have earned an amazing 40.4% per year between 1996 and 2014. However, the
investments required for such a portfolio are not even feasible: the optimizer calls for short
exposure to certain hedge fund categories. Nevertheless, mathematical optimizers can be
a useful guide for investors, calling attention to assets that have historically had desirable
average returns, low correlation, or other characteristics. It is usually helpful to constrain the
set of solutions from which the optimizer may choose, preemptively eliminating solutions that
are too risky, too illiquid, involve too much leverage, or are outside the feasible investment
universe. In Table 15 we show a number of mean-variance-optimized portfolio weights subject
to such constraints. Results toward the top of the table are generally more constrained and
are probably a better guide to the sorts of choices a prudent investor might have made during
the previous 19 years.
In addition to the traditional constraint on the portfolio’s standard deviation, we employ
a more novel constraint on portfolio autocorrelation in an effort to avoid portfolios that are
likely to be too illiquid. While some endowments may be able to tolerate an illiquid portfolio
because their investment horizon is presumably unbounded, individual investors often need
to access their assets sooner and may choose to be more cautious about illiquidity. See
Section 5.4 for further discussion about mean-variance-illiquidity optimization.

8.2

Over-Diversification

The proliferation of multi-strategy funds and funds of funds over the past two decades has
given investors an unprecedented amount of diversification within the hedge-fund industry

(Learned and Lhabitant (2003) and Amo, Harasty, and Hillion (2007)). However, the Financial Crisis of 2007–2009 has called into question the view that hedge funds are really
“hedged”, and that diversification across hedge-fund styles is beneficial. Billio, Getmansky,
and Pelizzon (2013) find that the average correlation among hedge-fund strategies jumped
from 0.32 in August 2008 to 0.52 in September 2008, a 64% increase. At the same time,
the average returns of most hedge funds have declined significantly (see Section 7.3), leaving
investors wondering whether hedge-fund investing is still worthwhile.
Cumming, Dai, and Shawky (2012) show that on a risk-adjusted basis, hedge funds
that diversify across sectors and asset classes outperform other funds by an average of 1.6%
per year. However, diversification across styles is found to exhibit a significant negative
association with hedge fund returns. Nevertheless, for funds of funds, the authors find a
significant positive relation between performance and diversification across sectors, styles,
and geographies.
In documenting the performance of the hedge-fund industry from 1995 to 2004, Fung,
Hsieh, Naik, and Ramadorai (2008) find that, on average, funds of funds deliver alpha only
in the period between October 1998 and March 2000, although a subset of funds of funds do
seem to have consistent alpha.
Furthermore, Brown, Gregoriou, and Pascalau (2011) find that the variance-reducing
effects of diversification become insignificant once a fund of funds holds more than 20 underlying hedge funds. Yet the majority of funds of funds are more diversified than this.
They find that over-diversification by funds of funds can increase left-tail risk exposure and
lower expected returns, especially when hedge fund returns are smoothed. This increase in
tail risk is accompanied by lower returns, which they attribute to the cost of necessary due
diligence, a drag on performance that increases with the number of underlying hedge funds
in portfolio.

Investment Implications

Reviewing the performance characteristics of hedge funds has provided ample evidence to
support the view that investors selecting their strategic asset allocations should not consider
hedge funds to be a monolithic category. The decision to allocate assets to a hedge fund
strategy should involve the consideration of a number of factors. First, of course, is a
strategy’s potential for contributing positive returns—determining this factor we leave solely
to the investor. But just as important is the investor’s consideration as to which hedge fund
risks she can best afford to add to her portfolio. Are occasional large losses acceptable?
Is an investment uncorrelated with equities preferable? What volatility is acceptable? Are
81

correlated strategies already in her portfolio? Our results suggest that while many hedge
fund categories have similar characteristics, they are different enough that an investor in
alternatives should pause and determine which investment styles are most consistent with
her risk preferences.
If an investor sought to simply maximize expected returns without regard for risk, her
investment procedure would be simple: forecast the returns of each candidate investment and
allocate 100% of her assets to the investment associated with the highest expected return.
However, most investors are concerned about the risk of large losses. To limit the potential for
large losses, investors tend to exploit at least one of two strategies: first, they generally spread
their capital across a number of investments that they expect to produce good returns in the
hope that not all of the investments will simultaneously decline in value (diversification). And
second, they may choose to allocate more of their assets to investments that they deem less
likely to experience large price decreases. The implementation of these two risk mitigation
strategies is often based on forecasts of volatility and correlation. While a good starting
place, this approach falls short when one contemplates investments whose distributions are
likely to have non-zero higher moments (of particular concern is the combination of positive
excess kurtosis and negative skewness, a combination that reflects a history of large sudden
losses). Unfortunately, this encompasses nearly all of the investments considered thus far,
including, to a degree, stocks and bonds (see Table 16).

Investors’ confidence in the traditional 60% stocks, 40% bonds portfolio seems to have
declined in recent years. The brutal stock market slumps bookending the recent decade seem
to have erased the investing euphoria of the 90s, while a suspicion that interest rates may
reverse their decades-long trend and plateau, or even rise, tempers interest in bonds. Thus
ever more investors are asking whether they should allocate a portion of their portfolios to
“alternatives”—generally defined as anything other than stocks, bonds, and cash. For many
investors, especially high-net-worth investors, pension funds, and endowments, investing in
alternatives may include an allocation to hedge funds.
Table 16 reports performance statistics for the S&P 500 Total Return Index (stock portfolio), Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index (bond portfolio), and 60/40 stocks/bonds portfolio for
the period January 1996 through December 2014. Over the past 19 years both stock and
bond asset classes have produced attractive returns, albeit at strikingly different volatilities.
Because U.S. interest rates have declined over this period, some argue that the extremely
attractive risk-reward ratio of bonds should be viewed with an extra dose of skepticism when
making decisions about future asset allocations. Although the returns of stocks and bonds
are hardly IID normal, in comparison to the returns of most hedge fund investment styles
they look well-behaved, having relatively modest kurtosis, negative skewness, and autocorrelation. Interestingly enough, the average return (and Sharpe ratio) of hedge funds over
this period falls between that of stocks and bonds (see Table 6). In Table 16 we also summarize the simulated performance of a prototypical 60% stocks, 40% bonds portfolio (with free
monthly rebalancing) based on these two indexes. Note that the resulting two-asset portfolio, while less volatile, is still highly correlated with equities. Geczy (2014) finds similar
results—from 1999 through 2013, the correlation of returns between a 60/40 portfolio and a
100% equity portfolio was 0.98. Even if an investor invests 30% in stocks and 70% in bonds,
the resulting correlation with a 100% stock portfolio is 0.85. As a result, a long-only stock
and bond portfolio is not particularly well diversified.
Table 17 shows that reallocating 5%, 10%, 20%, or 50% from a 60/40 portfolio into
the (non-investable) “average” hedge fund would have decreased a traditional portfolio’s
volatility more than its returns. The combined effect is to increase the risk-adjusted excess
return by roughly 13%. Actual investors’ experiences, of course, would have varied based on
how similar their investment choices were to this average (and monthly-rebalanced) measure
of hedge fund returns, fees, and the tracking error associated with their stock and bond
investments. It is worth noting that many investors seeking a diverse exposure to hedge
funds choose to invest through a fund of funds, which, on average, would have resulted in
inferior returns (see Table 18).
Returning briefly to our earlier theme of hedge-fund style heterogeneity, we also simulated

the performance of a 48/32/20 stock/bond/hedge fund portfolio in which 20% of the assets
were allocated to one specific hedge-fund style (see Table 18). In some cases this would
have resulted in returns similar to those of the 60/40 stocks/bonds portfolio, earned a lower
volatility, and had a smaller maximum drawdown (e.g., Event Driven and Long/Short Equity
Hedge). In other cases, it would result in a similar level of volatility and returns (Emerging
Markets). The impact on the return distributions’ kurtosis is particularly varied, as some
portfolios have nearly no kurtosis while others have heavy tails.
As before, these simulations are based on the average return of funds within a category
and on portfolios rebalanced monthly. Both of these assumptions are likely to make the
simulated results look more attractive. It is interesting that, even with this advantage,
adding a 20% average hedge-fund allocation to a 60/40 portfolio would not have increased
the portfolio’s average (non-risk-adjusted) rate of return, despite the popular conception
that hedge funds regularly earn outsized returns. We note that many hedge-fund index
calculators, following a different methodology than our bias adjustments (see Section 3.2),
report more attractive returns for the industry. For example, Geczy (2014) shows that
adding a 15% allocation to alternatives and 5% each to alternative equity and alternative
fixed-income investments decreases total portfolio risk and increases expected returns.
In summary, the historical data show that hedge funds have not, on average, meaningfully

outperformed traditional portfolios of stocks and bonds after fees. On average, once returns
have been adjusted for various sampling biases (see Section 3.2), hedge funds do not routinely
generate double-digit returns. However, the ride for hedge-fund investors has generally been
smoother: as a group, hedge funds have exhibited lower volatility than traditional stock/bond
portfolios. In addition, there are a number of styles of hedge fund investing. While many
are correlated and have much in common, on the whole they are a heterogeneous lot: some
are as dissimilar as stocks and bonds. This is consistent with Brown and Goetzmann (2003)
who find that hedge funds are a reasonably heterogeneous group and present distinct styles.
Based on historical data, some styles of hedge fund investing result in higher volatility, and
some lower; some are correlated with equities, and some not; and some have a high propensity
to occasionally experience large losses, while others experience this to a lesser extent. Liang
(2004) studies asset allocation among hedge funds, funds of funds, and CTAs. He shows that
CTAs are a natural hedge for equity investments especially during market declines; CTAs
have relatively low correlations with hedge funds and funds of funds, and they have very
different characteristics from most hedge funds (see also Kaminski (2011)). We propose a
more systematic approach to alternative investing in the next section.

8.4

An Integrated Hedge-Fund Investment Process

Investing in hedge funds has changed considerably over the last two decades as the population of investors has grown beyond family offices, foundations, endowments, and high net
worth investors to include more traditional institutional investors such as pension funds,
sovereign wealth funds, and investment consultants. This shift in the investor base has
brought new tools, policies, and procedures to the hedge-fund industry because today’s institutional investors require an unprecedented degree of transparency, accountability, and
repeatability, i.e., they require an investment process, not just the ability to select a portfolio of hedge funds. Although in the past many institutional investors relied primarily on
the qualitative judgments that funds of funds managers offer, institutional investors today
often prefer a more systematic approach to making manager-selection decisions, as well as
broader asset-allocation decisions among various hedge-fund style categories.
Several systematic approaches have been proposed, largely led by practitioners from the
hedge-fund and funds of funds industry, and these approaches fall loosely into two groups:
top-down and bottom-up investment processes.
Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Financial Risk Management Ltd. (1999) develop a topdown absolute-return framework emphasizing diversification across as well as within hedgefund strategies, with the primary constraint being the investor’s ability to monitor multiple
86

managers. Bein and Wander (2002) propose a top-down risk allocation framework that
allows investors to explicitly integrate active management decisions and hedge-fund risks into
a traditional overall asset allocation process. Chung, Rosenberg, and Tomeo (2004) provide
another top-down hedge-fund asset allocation process by dividing hedge-fund strategies into
two classes: convergent strategies that benefit from small temporary mispricings, which
are short volatility, and divergent strategies that exploit larger and longer-horizon market
inefficiencies, which are long volatility. Given that divergent strategies tend to be profitable
during periods of heightened volatility and economic uncertainty, the authors argue that
allocating assets to both types of strategies can improve expected returns and reduce risk.
Several studies propose a bottom-up approach to constructing hedge-fund portfolios.
Zask (2000) describes a method for hedge-fund valuation based on management fees, performance fees, and discounted cash flows analysis. Stemme and Slattery (2002) outline the
practical considerations involved in selecting individual hedge funds, hiring a consultant, or
investing in a fund of funds, including costs, control, track record, and capacity issues. And
Clark and Winkelmann (2004) develop a framework where all hedge funds are analyzed based
on how much of the projected performance is due to market movements, due to manager
skill, and whether an investor is confident in the manager’s (or strategy’s) ability to continue
to deliver performance.
A hybrid approach proposed by Lo (2008) combines qualitative judgment with quantitative methods, a particularly important feature for investing in complex, multi-faceted, and
highly heterogeneous assets such as hedge funds. This combination is achieved through a
two-stage investment process in which a top-down asset allocation decision to broad hedgefund categories is coupled with bottom-up manager-selection decisions within each category.
Although a two-stage investment process is generally sub-optimal relative to a single-stage
optimization, the complexities and qualitative aspects of hedge-fund investing make a twostage approach more robust and easier to implement. This investment process is based on a
set of six basic design principles:
• The target expected return for each strategy should be commensurate with the risks
of that strategy—higher-risk strategies should have higher target expected returns.

• The uses of funds should determine the target expected return, not the sources of
capital.
• In evaluating the risk/reward ratio for each strategy, return autocorrelation and illiquidity exposure should be taken into account explicitly. In particular, the Sharpe ratios
of strategies with large positively serially correlated returns should be deflated (see Lo
87

(2001), Getmansky, Lo, and Makarov (2004), and Section 5 for details).
• Qualitative judgments about managers, strategies, and market conditions are valuable
inputs into the capital allocation process that no quantitative models can replace,
but those judgments should be integrated in a systematic and consistent fashion with
quantitative methods.
• Risk and performance attribution should be performed on a regular basis for and by
each manager, as well as for the entire portfolio.
• Risk limits and related guidelines for each manager should be consistent across time

and across managers, and should be communicated clearly to all managers on a regular
basis.

These design principles, coupled with insights from traditional portfolio management
theory and practice, imply a portfolio optimization component in which required or “target”
expected returns and variances are determined in advance by investor mandates and market
conditions, covariances are estimated via econometric methods and modified by qualitative
judgment, and then asset-class allocations are determined by minimizing variance subject
to an expected-return constraint. Within each asset class, manager-specific allocations are
determined by incorporating qualitative information into the investment process through a
scoring process. The seven components of this quantitative/qualitative investment process,
which we shall refer to as QQIP for convenience, are depicted in Figures 7 and 8 and given
by:
(i) Define asset classes by strategy.
(ii) Set target portfolio expected return, µo , and desired volatility, σo .
(iii) Set target expected returns and risks for asset classes.
(iv) Determine correlations via econometric analysis.
(v) Compute minimum-variance asset-class allocations subject to µo constraint.
(vi) Allocate capital to managers within each asset class.
(vii) Monitor performance and risk budgets, and re-optimize as needed.
Although Lo (2008) provides detailed discussions for each of these steps, he emphasizes
that this framework is meant to serve only as a starting point for designing a suitable
alternative investment process. Because of the heterogeneity of the hedge-fund industry and
the variability of investment objectives and constraints among investors, there is no single
investment process that fits all investors.

The first step in QQIP is to define the universe of all hedge funds into a smaller set of
categories where managers in each category pursue relatively homogeneous styles of investing.
An example of such categories is the Lipper TASS classification used throughout this survey
and described in the Appendix, but finer stratifications may be appropriate, depending on
the investment objectives of the investor and the size of the assets to be deployed.
The second step is to set a target expected return, desired level of risk, and acceptable
loss limits or maximum drawdown for the entire portfolio. While these parameters are, by
nature, rather ambiguous quantities when discussed among investment committee members
and investment officers, such discussions are invaluable in setting realistic expectations for
what a portfolio of hedge funds can offer.
Once these high-level parameters (or ranges of parameters) have been specified, the third
step is to do the same for the categories specified in the first step. This requires more
specialized knowledge of both the historical performance of individual categories of hedge
funds and how the categories are currently positioned. One way to develop target expected
returns and volatilities for hedge fund categories is to estimate linear factor models for
category indexes (see Section 6), and then to develop target expected returns and volatilities
for the factors. In many cases, it is easier to develop prospective intuition for the likely
behavior of factors such as liquidity, credit, the business cycle, and exchange ratios than for
hedge-fund category index returns.
Given the target expected returns and volatilities of the hedge-fund categories in the
investment universe, the next step in QQIP is to estimate the correlation matrix among
the index returns of the hedge-fund categories. This may seem straightforward from a
statistical perspective—use the standard estimator with historical data or a linear factor
model estimator that requires fewer estimated parameters (see Section 6.2). However, the
fact that correlations can change in response to market conditions makes this step more
challenging, requiring qualitative input to adjust the correlations to reflect current market
conditions that might not yet be reflected in historical time series estimators.33 In such
cases, qualitative adjustments to the correlation matrix of category-index returns may be
necessary, but it must be kept in mind that arbitrary changes to entries in a correlation matrix
could violate the positive semidefiniteness of the matrix. If such violations are ignored, the
outcome of a portfolio optimization using such a matrix could yield nonsensical results such
as negative variances. To avoid these pathologies, it is possible to compute the positive
semidefinite correlation matrix that is “closest” to the qualitatively adjusted correlation
33

For example, during periods of macroeconomic stress, U.S. equities become more highly correlated with
foreign currency movements, hence correlations between long/short equity managers and foreign currency
traders may be higher than historical estimates would imply if economic conditions deteriorate.

matrix using methods developed by Higham (2002) and Qi and Sun (2006).
Once the target expected returns, volatilities, and correlations among the hedge-fund
categories have been determined, the next step in QQIP is to construct an optimal portfolio.
There are several methods for doing so—see, for example, Brennan, Lo, and Nguyen (2015)—
but a natural starting point is to find the asset allocation over hedge-fund categories that
minimizes the portfolio variance subject to the target portfolio expected return constraint
specified in step 1. For most fund-of-fund and multi-manager applications, it is also necessary
to impose non-negativity constraints on the portfolio weights since it is typically impossible to
establish a “short” position in a manager. However, as long as the target expected returns are
realistic and the covariance matrix is well-behaved, (19) should yield non-negative portfolio
weights.34
Min 12 ω ′ Σω subject to ω ′ µ ≥ µo and ω ′ ι = 1 .
ω

(18)

The solution to (18) is given by (see Lo (2008)):
ω ∗ = λ Σ−1µ + ξ Σ−1 ι

(19)

where λ and ξ are constants defined in Lo (2008). As a consistency check, it is useful to
compute the volatility σ of the entire portfolio implied by ω ∗ :
σ =

√

ω ∗′ Σω ∗ .

(20)

If σ is higher than σo , this implies an inconsistency with the following set of objectives:
• target expected return (µo )
• desired risk level (σo )

• target expected returns and risks of asset classes (µi , σi )

and at least one of these three objectives must be modified to restore consistency. If the
total investment capital is K, the optimal dollar-allocation to each asset class is simply Ki∗
34

If not, this may be a sign of model misspecification that can serve as a useful diagnostic for identifying
potential problems with the portfolio construction process. Alternatively, recent innovations in structured
products do allow the synthetic shorting of certain hedge-fund strategies, in which case, more efficient fundof-funds portfolios may be possible. However, given the complexities of over-the-counter derivatives on hedge
funds and the significant risks they can generate, the shorting hedge funds should be contemplated only by
the most sophisticated and well-capitalized investors.

92

where:
Ki∗ = ωi∗ K

(21)

Once the category asset allocations, {Ki∗ }, have been determined, the next step is to
decide how to allocate each Ki∗ across individual managers within each category i. Although
a similar mean-variance optimization may be performed at this stage, the target expected
returns, variances, and correlations among individual managers are much harder to estimate
precisely. Therefore, the impact of estimation error may outweigh the gains from optimization methods at this level.
An alternative is to begin with identical allocations, Ki∗ /mi , across all mi managers in
category i that satisfy certain minimum conditions, e.g., assets under management, years of
experience, track record, etc. Then for each manager, construct a score, Sik , by evaluating
the manager against the following criteria, perhaps using a numerical score from 1 to 5 for
each criterion:
• anticipated alpha
• anticipated risk

• anticipated capacity

• anticipated correlation with other managers and asset classes
• trading experience and past performance
• backtest performance attribution
• tracking error
• risk controls

• risk transparency

• alpha transparency
• operational risks
• social impact

• other qualitative characteristics
For example, a manager with a high anticipated alpha—as determined through the largely
qualitative manager-selection and due-diligence processes—would receive a score of 5, and
a manager with a low anticipated alpha would receive a score of 1. Similarly, a high-risk
manager (relative to the asset-class volatility, σi ) would receive a score of 1 and a moderaterisk manager would receive a score of 3. The sum of each of these ratings yields the manager’s

93

score, Sik . Then define the relative score, sik , as:
sik =

Sik
.
Si1 + · · · + Simi

(22)

These scores are given equal weighting in (22) but can easily be assigned unique weights to
over- or under-emphasize specific attributes. The manager’s allocation can then be defined
as:
γik = (1 − δ) ×

1
+ δ × sik
mi

(23)

where δ is a parameter that determines the weight placed on the relative score (22) vs.
equal-weighting.
For a given set of manager allocations, γ i ≡ [ γi1 · · · γimi ]′ , in asset class i, the implied
expected return and volatility of the asset class are given by:
µ̃i = γ ′i ν i

,

σ̃i =

p
γ ′i Σi γ i

(24)

where ν i is the vector of expected returns of each manager in asset class i (as determined either by backtests or historical performance), and Σi is the covariance matrix of the managers
in asset class i. Before implementing the allocation γ i , it is important to check whether the
implied expected return and risk of γ i given in (24) is consistent with the target expected
return and risk, µi and σi , for sector i. If not, then the allocations in γ i may need to be
adjusted, or the target expected return and risk must be adjusted to reduce the discrepancy.
Given an allocation γ i , each manager’s dollar allocation is then:
∗
Kik
= Ki∗ × γik .

(25)

These scores should be recomputed at least quarterly, and possibly more frequently as
changes in market conditions might dictate. Each manager should be given his/her score so
that the manager is aware of the link between performance (as determined by the many dimensions of the score) and capital allocation. Moreover, such scores can be used as a hurdle
for evaluating new managers, so that the process of manager selection is less arbitrary over
time and across individual fund analysts.

94

The last step in QQIP is to monitor the performance of each manager regularly to ensure
that risk budgets and investment mandates are being maintained, and that managers are
not straying from their stated styles. For example, if the target risk of asset class i is σi ,
then the realized volatility, σ̂i , of the asset class can be compared to σi to determine any
discrepancies that require further investigation, where:
σ̂i ≡

p
γ ′i Σi γ i

(26)

and Σi is the estimated covariance matrix of the mi managers in asset class i. Those managers
that contribute more than proportionally to the asset-class volatility σ̂i may be required to
accept lower capital allocations, and vice versa, other things equal. As performance varies
and as parameters change, the allocations across asset classes and across managers will
require periodic updating. Allocations should be recomputed monthly, although no action is
needed unless the updated allocations are significantly different from the current allocations.
The scope of QQIP can be broadened to include other alternative investments such as
venture capital, private equity, and impact investments. However, in such cases, a meanvariance objective function is likely to be inadequate for capturing the investment characteristics of these asset classes. In particular, both venture capital and private equity contain
significant illiquidity premia given the nature of those investments, and also involve longer
holding periods, hence the mean-variance-liquidity objective function described in Section
5.4 and depicted in Figure 3 may be more appropriate. For impact investments such as
environment-related technologies, socially responsible companies, and venture philanthropy,
additional metrics that measure impact must be incorporated into the objective function
along with risk and expected return. Once such metrics are constructed, the framework of
QQIP can be applied to the augmented objective function.
QQIP is considerably more intricate than the straightforward construction of a typical
long-only large-cap U.S. equity portfolio, but the intricacies are a manifestation of the greater
complexities of alternative investments, and the fact that qualitative judgment still plays a
significant role in this endeavor. Nevertheless, the industry is changing rapidly and the
hedge-fund investment process is becoming more systematic across all investors. Supporting
this trend are various innovations in academic research, new and improved hedge-fund data
sources, more sophisticated software applications for hedge-fund portfolio construction and
risk management, and professional organizations such as the Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA), the Managed Funds Association (MFA), and the Chartered
Alternative Investment Analysts (CAIA) Association and CAIA certification. These inno95

vations parallel the shift in the mutual fund industry during the 1970s and 1980s toward
greater transparency, lower fees, and a more disciplined investment framework, all of which
has contributed to the growth and success of the entire industry.

8.5

The Adaptive Markets Hypothesis

One of the most enduring challenges to the very existence of the hedge-fund industry is the
Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH), the idea that market prices fully reflect all available
information. If the EMH holds, how can hedge funds earn “excess” expected returns over
time? The answer to this question is not just of academic interest—it has consequences for
how investors should allocate their capital across traditional and alternative assets, and how
they and regulators should respond to the rapid growth of the hedge-fund industry.
One possible answer is that the EMH is false and hedge funds routinely exploit the
departures from efficiency. However, this explanation does not account for the high failure
rate in the hedge-fund industry, the capacity constraints that the most successful funds face,
and the occasional periods of significant underperformance experienced by the entire industry
in comparison to passive buy-and-hold investments. By all accounts, it is very difficult to
produce excess risk-adjusted returns consistently and for large pools of assets.
The other extreme is that the EMH is true and hedge funds are simply taking on additional sources of risk that have positive risk premia associated with them. There is some
empirical evidence for this view based on estimates of linear factor models for hedge fund
returns in which liquidity, credit, and volatility are statistically significant factors driving
industry returns (see Section 6). However, there are a number of inordinately successful managers that earn positive risk-adjusted returns even after controlling for such factors, including
industry icons such as Warren Buffett, Paul Tudor Jones, Julian Robertson, David Shaw,
James Simons, George Soros, and others. It is difficult to dismiss all of these individuals as
statistical flukes.
The theoretical foundations of the hedge-fund industry can be found in the work of
Sandy Grossman, a successful hedge-fund manager in his own right. In Grossman (1976)
and Grossman and Stiglitz (1980), he and Nobel-prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz
argue convincingly that perfectly informationally efficient markets are an impossibility. If
markets are perfectly efficient, there is no profit to gathering information, in which case there
would be little reason to trade and markets would not exhibit the volume they currently do.
Alternatively, market efficiency is not a binary state but rather a continuum; the degree
of market inefficiency determines the effort investors will expend to gather and trade on
information. Therefore, a non-degenerate market equilibrium occurs only when there are
96

sufficient profit opportunities, i.e., inefficiencies, to compensate investors for the costs of
trading and information-gathering. The profits earned by these industrious investors are
not free lunches, but the “economic rents” that accrue to those willing to engage in such
activities.
Who are the providers of these rents? Black (1986) provides a compelling answer: “noise
traders”, individuals who trade for non-informational reasons such as liquidity needs, portfolio rebalancing trades, or random misinformation.
More broadly, the conflict between the EMH and the hedge-fund industry can be reconciled by acknowledging that, like any other industry, value-added is created through innovation and eventually commoditized and depleted through competition. For example,
the first mobile device that allowed users to exchange emails remotely—the Blackberry by
Research In Motion (RIM)—generated enormous shareholder value for its owners. The returns that accrued to RIM’s original investors are unlikely to be explained by any set of risk
factors, especially since the mobile communications industry was just emerging, thanks in
no small part to the market that RIM created. Since then, this industry has matured and
several competitors to the Blackberry have captured significant market share, including the
Apple iPhone and other Android smartphones. The recent returns to RIM investors have
been disappointing, not because of changes in factor risk premia, but because competition
has reduced RIM’s customer base and RIM has not yet fully adapted to current market
conditions.
The dynamics of industrial organization and competition can easily explain the rise and
fall of corporations—the same principles apply to hedge-fund strategies and funds. The
waxing and waning and re-emergence of various hedge-fund styles are simply manifestations
of Schumpeter’s (1939) “creative destruction”, an observation that led Lo (2012) to call
the hedge-fund industry the “Galapagos Islands of the financial sector”.35 By appealing to
the principles of evolution—innovation, adaptation, competition, and natural selection—Lo
(2004, 2005, 2012, 2015) develops an alternative to the EMH which he calls the Adaptive
Markets Hypothesis (AMH). The AMH provides a natural and internally consistent reconciliation of the apparent contradiction between the EMH and the existence and profitability
of hedge funds. From the AMH perspective, the EMH is not wrong; it is simply incomplete.
Prices reflect as much information as is available from the combination of environmental conditions and the number and nature of “species” in the economy or, to use the appropriate
biological term, the market ecology. By species, Lo is referring to distinct groups of mar35

Other evolutionary models of financial markets include: Blume and Easley (1992), Luo (1995, 1998,
2001, 2003), Farmer and Lo (1999), Farmer (2002), Hirshleifer and Luo (2001), Kogan, Ross, Wang, and
Westerfield (2006), and Brennan and Lo (2011).

97

ket participants, each behaving in a common manner. For example, pension funds may be
considered one species; mutual funds, another; broker/dealers, a third; and hedge-fund managers, a fourth. If multiple species—or the members of a single highly populous species—are
competing for scarce resources within a single market, that market is likely to become highly
efficient, e.g., the market for S&P 500 futures contracts. If, on the other hand, a small number of species are competing for rather abundant resources in a given market, that market
is likely to be less efficient, e.g., the market for pre-Columbian artifacts. Market efficiency
is highly context-dependent and dynamic, in much the same way that animal populations
advance and decline as a function of the seasons, the number of predators and prey they
face, and their abilities to adapt to an ever-changing environment.
The profit opportunities in any given market are akin to the amount of food and water
in a particular local ecology—the more resources present, the less fierce the competition. As
competition increases, either because of dwindling food supplies or an increase in the animal
population, resources are depleted which, in turn, causes a population decline eventually, decreasing the level of competition and starting the cycle again. In some cases, cycles converge
to corner solutions, i.e., certain species become extinct, food sources are permanently exhausted, or environmental conditions shift dramatically. By viewing economic profits as the
ultimate food source on which market participants depend for their survival, the dynamics of
market interactions and financial innovation can be readily derived. From this perspective,
the hedge-fund industry is the Galapagos Islands of the financial system—evolutionary dynamics can be seen by the naked eye through the waxing and waning of investment strategies
and the birth and death of hedge funds across the various categories. And in the same way
that an extinction event for one species can generate ripple effects that have devastating
consequences for many other species, extreme losses in the hedge-fund industry can serve as
early warning signs of far greater dislocation in the financial ecosystem (see Section 7.1).
Under the AMH, there is no contradiction between the competitiveness of the financial
industry and the possibility that market dislocation can occur and, as a result, certain
hedge funds can earn extraordinary profits. During the Fall of 1998, the desire for liquidity
and safety by a certain population of investors overwhelmed the population of hedge funds
attempting to arbitrage such preferences, causing those arbitrage relations to break down.
However, in the years prior to August 1998, fixed-income relative-value traders profited
handsomely from these activities, presumably at the expense of individuals with seemingly
“irrational” preferences. In fact, such preferences were shaped by a certain set of evolutionary
forces, and might be quite rational in other contexts.
Therefore, under the AMH, investment strategies undergo cycles of profitability and loss
in response to changing business conditions, the number of competitors entering and exiting
98

the industry, and the type and magnitude of profit opportunities available. As opportunities shift, so too will the affected populations. For example, after 1998, the number of
fixed-income relative-value hedge funds declined dramatically—because of outright failures,
investor redemptions, and fewer startups in this sector—but many reappeared in subsequent
years as performance for this type of investment strategy improved, until the Financial Crisis
of 2007–2009.
Empirical support for the AMH as it applies to the hedge-fund industry can be found
in the dynamics of hedge-fund births and deaths, documented in Section 3.3. Hedge-fund
strategies and funds wax and wane in response to risk and reward, as Table 3 clearly shows.
A more specific illustration is contained in Figure 9, which depicts the entries, exits, and
average annual returns for funds in two particularly dynamic hedge-fund categories, fixedincome arbitrage and equity market neutral. Figure 9a shows that the 1998 rout in fixedincome arbitrage caused a slight increase in the number of funds exiting this category, but
its annual returns recovered quickly and the total number of fixed-income-arbitrage funds
continued to climb until the Financial Crisis of 2007–2009. However, even before the crisis
hit, as the average annual return of fixed-income arbitrage trended downward from 2001 to
2006, the number of exits climbed. Beginning in 2007, the widespread liquidity problems of
the crisis caused returns to drop precipitously, along with an unprecedented exodus of capital
and hedge funds from fixed-income arbitrage, after which returns improved once more.
Figure 9b offers a somewhat different narrative for equity market neutral hedge funds,
whose pre-crisis annual returns were more stable than those of fixed-income arbitrage. This
stability contributed to the popularity of this category, also known as “statistical arbitrage”,
which grew rapidly until its peak in 2007. However, the Quant Meltdown of August 2007
caught many investors and managers by surprise (see Section 7.1), and led to a large number
of hedge-fund exits and capital flight from this category post-crisis. Returns are recovering
and there are signs that this category is waxing again, however, the changing technological
and regulatory landscape of equity markets have greatly increased the complexity of the
environment in which equity market neutral hedge funds operate.
The AMH has a number of concrete implications for the hedge-fund industry. The first
implication is that contrary to the classical EMH, arbitrage opportunities do exist from time
to time in the AMH, as Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) have argued. From an evolutionary
perspective, the existence of active liquid financial markets implies that profit opportunities
must be present. As they are exploited, they disappear. But new opportunities are also
continually being created as certain species die out, as others are born, and as institutions
and business conditions change. Rather than the inexorable trend towards higher efficiency
predicted by the EMH, the AMH implies considerably more complex market dynamics, with

cycles as well as trends, and panics, manias, bubbles, crashes, and other phenomena that
are routinely witnessed in natural market ecologies. These dynamics provide the motivation
for active management as Bernstein (1998) suggests, also giving rise to Niederhoffer’s (1998)
“carnivores” and “decomposers”.
A second implication—highlighted by the entry-and-exit dynamics noted in Section 3.3
and Figure 9—is that investment strategies will also wax and wane, performing well in certain
environments and performing poorly in other environments. Contrary to the classical EMH
in which arbitrage opportunities are competed away, eventually eliminating the profitability
of the strategy designed to exploit the arbitrage, the AMH implies that such strategies
may decline for a time, and then return to profitability when environmental conditions
become more conducive to such trades. An obvious example is risk arbitrage, which has
been unprofitable for several years because of the decline in investment banking activity
since 2001. However, as mergers and acquisitions activity begins to pick up again, risk
arbitrage will start to regain its popularity among both investors and portfolio managers, as
it has recently.
A more striking example is autocorrelation in U.S. stock returns. As a measure of market efficiency (recall that the Random Walk Hypothesis implies that returns are serially
uncorrelated), autocorrelations of the CRSP value-weighted equity returns index might be
expected to take on larger values during the early part of the sample and become progressively smaller during recent years as the U.S. equity market becomes more efficient. Figure
10 displays the statistical significance of the first five autocorrelations of 500-day rolling
windows of daily CRSP value-weighted returns according to the Ljung-Box Q-statistic.36
There are clearly extended periods where autocorrelation is statistically significant such as
the 1950s, the 1970s, and the past five years. The degree of efficiency—as measured by the
first five autocorrelations—varies through time in a cyclical fashion, and there are periods
in the 1960s where the market is apparently more efficient than now!
Such cycles are not ruled out by the EMH in theory, but in practice, none of its existing
empirical implementations have incorporated these dynamics, assuming instead a stationary
36

To obtain a summary measure of the overall statistical significance of the autocorrelations, Ljung and
Box (1978) propose the following test statistic:
Q = T (T +2)

p
X

k=1

ρ̂2k /(T −k)

(27)

which is asymptotically χ2p under the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation (see Kendall, Stuart and Ord
(1983, Chapter 50.13) for details). By forming the sum of squared autocorrelations, Q reflects the absolute magnitudes of the ρ̂k ’s irrespective of their signs, hence time series with large positive or negative
autocorrelation coefficients will exhibit large Q-statistics.

world in which markets are perpetually in equilibrium. This widening gulf between the
stationary EMH and obvious shifts in market conditions have no doubt contributed to the
recent spate of new investment offerings including risk-parity funds, tactical asset allocation
funds, and various active ETFs.
A third implication is that innovation is the key to survival. The classical EMH suggests
that certain levels of expected returns can be achieved simply by bearing a sufficient degree
of risk. The AMH implies that the risk/reward relation varies through time, and that
a better way of achieving a consistent level of expected returns is to adapt to changing
market conditions. By evolving a multiplicity of capabilities that are suited to a variety of
environmental conditions, investment managers are less likely to become extinct as a result
of rapid changes in business conditions. Consider the current theory of the demise of the
dinosaurs (Alvarez, 1997), and ask where the next financial asteroid might come from.
Finally, the AMH has a clear implication for all financial market participants: survival is
the only objective that matters in the long run. While profit maximization, utility maximization, and general equilibrium are certainly relevant aspects of market ecology, the organizing
principle in determining the evolution of markets and financial technology is simply survival.
These evolutionary underpinnings are more than simple speculation in the context of the
hedge-fund industry. The extraordinary degree of competitiveness of global financial markets, the outsize rewards that accrue to the “fittest” managers, and the relatively low barriers
to entry and minimal fixed costs of setup suggest that Darwinian selection—“survival of the
richest”, to be precise—is at work in determining the typical profile of the successful hedge
fund. After all, unsuccessful managers are rather quickly eliminated from the population after suffering a certain level of losses, only to be replaced by many eager professionals hoping
to make their own name in this dynamic industry. In the same spirit in which the evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky (1973) observed that “nothing in biology makes sense
except in the light of evolution”, none of the dynamics of the hedge-fund industry make
sense except in the light of adaptive markets.

Conclusion

Two dangerous myths about hedge funds can mislead investors, portfolios, regulators, and
policymakers into making inappropriate decisions. The first myth is that all hedge funds are
alike, implying that alternative investments comprise a homogeneous asset class that have
similar investment characteristics with returns that move in concert. The second myth is
that all hedge funds are unique, implying no commonalities and, therefore, no implications
for diversification or systemic risk. In this review article, we hope to have dispelled both
these myths by reviewing various aspects of the hedge-fund literature and their implications
for all stakeholders in this important and dynamic industry.
The freedom with which hedge funds are allowed to invest their capital gives them unique
breadth of coverage as an industry and unique depth of expertise at the individual fund level.
However, their unconstrained and varied investment strategies contain non-standard forms
of risk including phase-locking behavior, illiquidity, nonlinearities, and operational risks that
are poorly captured by conventional metrics. More sophisticated risk models are available,
but they require much greater training and experience.
The highly competitive nature of this industry implies rapid innovation and attrition,
which can greatly benefit the nimble and risk-tolerant investor, but which can be a source
of great stress and financial loss for the naive and inattentive investor. But considering the
suitability of the various risk dimensions associated with each hedge-fund investment style
along with the potential for generating attractive returns, investors can construct a systematic investment process that incorporates hedge-fund investments into more traditional
portfolios.
The adaptiveness of the hedge-fund industry also implies that hedge funds can serve as an
invaluable monitoring system for identifying trouble spots throughout the financial system.
The Financial Crisis of 2007–2009 left a significant mark on the industry, ending an era of
excessive optimism about hedge-fund returns and starting a new era in which the industry
is retrenching and re-emphasizing its core competencies under heavy investor scrutiny.
Because the hedge-fund industry will continue to evolve rapidly in response to new challenges and opportunities, continuous monitoring and research will be necessary for investors,
regulators, and hedge-fund managers to keep up with these changes, and we hope this survey
provides a useful perspective for this task.

Appendix
Lipper TASS Fund Category Definitions

The following is a list of Lipper TASS category descriptions, that defines the criteria used
by Lipper TASS in assigning funds in their database to one of 11 possible categories:
Convertible Arbitrage This strategy is identified by hedge investing in the convertible securities of a
company. A typical investment is to be long the convertible bond and short the common stock of the
same company. Positions are designed to generate profits from the fixed income security as well as
the short sale of stock, while protecting principal from market moves.
Dedicated Short Bias Short biased managers take short positions in mostly equities and derivatives. The
short bias of a manager’s portfolio must be constantly greater than zero to be classified in this category.
Emerging Markets This strategy involves equity or fixed income investing in emerging markets around
the world. As many emerging markets do not allow short selling, nor offer viable futures or other
derivative products with which to hedge, emerging market investing often employs a long-only strategy.
Equity Market Neutral This investment strategy is designed to exploit equity and/or fixed income market inefficiencies and usually involves being simultaneously long and short matched market portfolios
of the same size within a country. Market neutral portfolios are designed to be either beta or currency
neutral, or both.
Event Driven This strategy is defined as ’special situations’ investing designed to capture price movement
generated by a significant pending corporate event such as a merger, corporate restructuring, liquidation, bankruptcy or reorganization. There are three popular sub-categories in event-driven strategies:
risk (merger) arbitrage, distressed/high yield securities, and Regulation D.
Risk Arbitrage - This strategy is identified by managers investing simultaneously in long and short
positions in both companies involved in a merger or acquisitions. Merger arbitrageurs are typically
long the stock of the company being acquired and short the stock of the acquirer. The principal risk
is deal risk, should the merger or acquisition fail to close.
Distressed Securities - Fund managers invest in the debt, equity or trade claims of companies in
financial distress and generally bankrupt. The securities of companies in need of legal action or
restructuring to revive financial stability typically trade at substantial discounts to par value and
thereby attract investments when managers perceive that a turn-around will materialize.
High Yield - Often called junk bonds, this strategy refers to investing in low-grade fixed-income
securities of companies that show significant upside potential. Managers generally buy and hold high
yield debt.
Regulation D - This strategy refers to investments in micro and small capitalization public companies
that are raising money in private capital markets. Investments usually take the form of a convertible
security with an exercise price that floats or is subject to a look-back provision that insulates the
investor from a decline in the price of the underlying stock.

105

Fixed Income Arbitrage Funds that attempt to limit volatility and generate profits from price anomalies
between related fixed income securities. Most managers trade globally with a goal of generating steady
returns with low volatility. This category includes interest rate swap arbitrage, United States and
non-United States government bond arbitrage, forward yield curve arbitrage and mortgage-backed
securities arbitrage. The mortgage-backed market is primarily United States-based and over-thecounter.
Global Macro Global macro managers carry long and short positions in any of the world’s major capital
or derivative markets. These positions reflect their views on overall market direction as influenced
by major economic trends and or events. The portfolios of these funds can include stocks, bonds,
currencies, and commodities in the form of cash or derivatives instruments. Most funds invest globally
in both developed and emerging markets.
Long/Short Equity This directional strategy involves equity-oriented investing on both the long and short
sides of the market. The objective is not to be market neutral. Managers have the ability to shift from
value to growth, from small to medium to large capitalization stocks, and from a net long position
to a net short position. Managers may use futures and options to hedge. The focus may be regional,
such as long/short U.S. or European equity, or sector specific, such as long and short technology or
healthcare stocks. Long/short equity funds tend to build and hold portfolios that are substantially
more concentrated than those of traditional stock funds.
Managed Futures This strategy invests in listed financial and commodity futures markets and currency
markets around the world. The managers are usually referred to as Commodity Trading Advisors, or
CTAs. Trading disciplines are generally systematic or discretionary. Systematic traders tend to use
price and market specific information (often technical) to make trading decisions, while discretionary
managers use a judgmental approach.
Multi-Strategy This strategy describes hedge funds that use several strategies within the same pool of
assets. Hedge funds can use quantitative and fundamental techniques; strategies that are broadly
diversified or narrowly focused on specific sectors, have different levels of net exposure, leverage
employed, holding period, market capitalization, and valuation techniques.
Fund of Funds A ’Multi Manager’ fund will employ the services of two or more trading advisers or Hedge
Funds who will be allocated cash by the Trading Manager to trade on behalf of the fund.

A.2

Cleaning Lipper TASS Data

The objective is to detect likely data-entry errors and remove them so that they do not bias
the results. For example, if a return were too large by a factor of 100, this might introduce
an unwanted bias into the results. As a first step, we re-compute each monthly return based
on the reported net asset values (NAVs) to get a more-precise estimate of the rate of return.
When the NAV is missing, we simply use the reported rate of return. Then we reject the
following three types of suspicious data: monthly returns less than −100%, monthly returns
106

greater than 200%, and monthly returns that are exactly equal to the previous two months’
returns.
Except in the birth-death analysis, we restrict our attention to funds that report monthly.
Lipper TASS flags nearly all such funds, and in addition we systematically flag as nonmonthly any fund whose returns start and stop more than four times (a characteristic that
is inconsistent with steady monthly reporting).

A.3

Glossary

Accredited Investor Accredited (or qualified) investor is defined by Rule 501 of Regulation D under the
Securities Act of 1933. Generally it refers to individuals with net worth exceeding $1 million and
organizations with net worth exceeding $5 million.
Advance Notice Period Advance notice period is the number of days’ notice an investor must provide a
hedge fund in advance of the redemption period.
Alpha Alpha captures an active return on an investment. Alpha is measured as the return on an investment
less systematic contributions to the return.
Beta A beta measures systematic risk of a stock or portfolio with respect to the market as a whole. Beta
is the coefficient produced by a univariate regression.
Carried Interest Carried interest or carry, is a share of the profits of an investment or investment fund
that is paid to the investment manager in excess of the amount that the manager contributes to the
partnership.
Credit Risk Credit risk is an investor’s risk of loss arising from a borrower who does not make payments
as promised. Such an event is called a default during which both interest and principal may be lost.
Drawdown The drawdown is the measure of decline from a historical peak in the cumulative profit of a
financial trading strategy.
Feeder Fund A feeder fund is an investment fund which does almost all of its investments through a master
fund via a master-feeder relationship. The master fund oversees all portfolio investments and trading
activity. A feeder fund’s structure is commonly used by hedge funds to pool investment capital.
Funds of Funds A fund of funds (FOF) is an investment strategy of holding a portfolio of other investment
funds. A fund of funds can invest in funds managed by the same investment company or can invest
in external funds.
Gate Provision Gate provision is a restriction placed on a hedge fund limiting the amount of withdrawals
from the fund during a redemption period. This provision is agreed upfront between a hedge fund
manager and a limited partner. Gates are common when illiquid assets are involved. A hedge fund
manager has the right to implement the gate provision. The purpose of gates is to prevent a run on
the fund by limiting withdrawals. This run on the fund can be especially exacerbated when illiquid
securities are involved.

107

Hedge Fund A hedge fund is an investment fund that can undertake various investment strategies, is
typically open-ended, and is open only to particular types of investors specified by regulators. Hedge
fund typically employ a wide array of strategies, can short sell, and employ leverage. Hedge fund tend
to invest in various asset classes, implement high and low frequency trading, be long and short, invest
in assets and derivatives, and have fundamental and quantitative strategies.
High-Water Mark High-water mark is a loss carry-forward provision applied to the calculation of performance fees of hedge funds. When a fund is subject to a high-water mark provision, it will earn
performance fees only on net profits, i.e., profits after losses in previous years have been recovered.
Hurdle Rate A hurdle, in the context of an incentive fee, is a level of return that the fund must beat before
it can charge an incentive fee. Hurdle rates are typically set as a percentage or are referenced to an
index. A typical index for this purpose might be LIBOR (or an equivalent) or an index reflecting the
underlying market in which the fund is investing.
Incentive Fee A performance fee that is charged by investment managers of hedge funds. The fee is
calculated as a percentage of the increase in the investment fund’s net asset value (NAV), which
represents the value of the fund’s investments. A typical performance fee charged by hedge funds is
20% of the increase in the NAV of the fund. Typically, hedge funds only charge a performance fee on
increases in NAV over the high water mark.
Institutional Investor An institutional investor is an organization that trades securities in large quantities
or dollar amounts. Banks, insurance companies, pension funds, hedge funds, investment advisers,
and mutual funds are examples of institutional investors. Institutional investors often qualify for
preferential treatment and lower commissions.
Lock-up Period Lock-up period is an initial time period during which an investor cannot remove money
from a hedge fund. All subsequent investments by an investor are often subject to the lockup period.
Management Fee A management fee is a periodic payment that is paid by fund investors for investment
and portfolio management services. In a hedge fund, the management fee is calculated as a percentage
of the fund’s NAV at the time when the fee becomes payable. Management fees range from 1% to 4%
per annum with 2% being the norm/mode.
Mark-to-market Accounting Mark-to-market or fair value accounting refers to accounting for the fair
value of an asset or liability based on the current market price of the asset or liability or for similar
assets and liabilities.
Margin Buying Margin buying is buying securities with cash borrowed from a broker, using other securities
or cash as collateral.
Master-Feeder Master-feeder structure allows asset managers to capture the efficiencies of larger pools
of assets while allowing for separate market niches of individual funds. Several small feeder funds
contribute to one master fund. To comply with distinct legal systems of different jurisdictions, an
offshore feeder and an onshore feeder contribute to the same master portfolio.

108

Net Asset Value Net asset value (NAV) of a hedge fund is calculated as the total value of the fund’s
portfolio (its assets) less its accrued liabilities (money owed to lending banks, fees owed to investment
managers and service providers, and other liabilities).
Open-ended Hedge funds are typically open-ended, meaning that the fund will periodically accept investments and allow investors to withdraw money from the fund. However, hedge fund managers can
choose to be closed to new investment.
Redemption Period Redemption period is the number of days an investor must wait before withdrawing
money. Most hedge funds have 45-65 day redemption periods.
Subscription Period Subscription period refers to the time period during which investors sign up and
commit capital to a hedge fund, before the actual closing of the purchase.
Two and Twenty Two and twenty refers to a typical hedge fund fee structure, where 2% of assets under
management is a fixed fee paid annually, and 20% of annual profits above some hurdle rate is the
incentive fee, also paid annually.
Volatility Volatility is captured by the standard deviation of the returns of a financial instrument.
