Might Global Uncertainty Promote International Trade?

ABSTRACT
Common wisdom dictates that uncertainty impedes trade—we show that uncertainty can fuel
more trade in a simple general equilibrium trade model with information frictions. In equilibrium,
increases in uncertainty increase both the mean and the variance in returns to exporting implying
that trade can increase or decrease with uncertainty depending on preferences. Under general
conditions on preferences, we characterize the importance of these forces using a sufficient
statistics approach. Higher uncertainty leads to increases in trade because agents receive
improved terms of trade, particularly in states of nature where consumption is most valuable.
Trade creates value, in part, by offering a mechanism to share risk and risk sharing is most
effective when both parties are uninformed.

In any discussion of the frictions to cross-border trade, inevitably one that arises is some discussion about information and uncertainty. Portes and Rey (2005) show that the volume of
phone calls between two countries predicts how much they trade. Gould (1994) and Rauch and
Trindade (2002) argue that immigrants trade more with their home countries. The argument is
so simple that it needs no formalization—information frictions create uncertainty and that this
uncertainty deters risk-averse exporters. In this paper, we show that uncertainty can fuel more
trade in a simple general equilibrium trade model.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that the effects of uncertainty on trade is far from clear. There
has been an increase in uncertainty about the future international trading environment with
the United States government taking a hostile stance to existing trade agreements and others
threatening retaliation. In particular, measures of policy uncertainty have increased dramatically since late 2016, see, e.g. Figure 1. Despite this uncertain environment, US exports relative
to GDP have grown by 17 percent since early 2016.
In a simple general equilibrium trade model with information frictions, we show how outcomes of this nature—uncertainty-fueled booms in trade—are possible. We deliver two insights
about the relationship between uncertainty and international trade. The first insight is about
mechanics: Uncertainty increases both the mean and the variance in the returns to exporting.
The implication is that trade can increase or decrease with uncertainty, depending on preferences over these different forces. Under general conditions on preferences, we characterize the
importance of these forces using a sufficient statistics approach. Once one understands certain
risk, prudence, and temperance properties of preferences, the change in mean and variance
are sufficient to characterize the change in trade flows to aggregate uncertainty. In the commonly used CES case, these sufficient statistics simply boil down to functions of the elasticity
of substitution across home and foreign varieties or the “trade elasticity.”
The second insight regards interpretation: Uncertainty facilitates cross-country risk sharing
and, hence, more trade. When uncertainty is high, other countries do not realize that bad states
of nature are prevailing domestically. Their exports provide the home country with lots of
goods in exactly the states when consumption is most needed. In contrast, when uncertainty is
low, this risk sharing mechanism is muted; informed countries substitute away from trade in
states when they would prefer not insure their trading partner. Thus, an interpretation of our
results is that uncertainty-fueled increases in trade are because risk sharing is most effective
when both parties are uninformed.
We demonstrate these results in a standard, simple general equilibrium trade model—a twogood, two-country Armington model. We introduce cross-country uncertainty in the most obvious way: Each country experiences a random shock that affects its export choice. Home firms
observe home shocks perfectly. Foreigners observe foreign shocks perfectly. But each group ob-

1

serves the other’s shocks imperfectly, with a noisy signal. Then every firm chooses how much
to export to an international market. The international relative price clears that market, goods
are immediately shipped to their destination country, and agents consume.
In our model, uncertainty is about another country’s endowment. But endowment risk is a
simple economic primitive that is a stand-in for many other sorts of uncertainty. For example, uncertainty about the quality of foreign exports or preference shocks are isomorphic to the
model we wrote down. Similarly, the endowment could represent production, net of deadweight “iceberg” losses, created by trade policy. Trade policy uncertainty creates randomness
is the residual supply. What matters to an exporting firms is not the source of uncertainty, or
the quantity or quality of foreign exports; they care about the distribution of the relative price
of their good. Section 3 establishes that the key to our results is that this relative price has a distribution that is right-skewed. Such a distribution arises naturally in this context because terms
of trade are never negative, but can be arbitrarily large. If some uncertain outcome makes the
right-skewed terms of trade more variable, it raises risk, but, under some plausible conditions,
also raises the average relative price. These competing mean and variance forces are central to
our analysis, and arise in settings where aggregate uncertainty affects trade.
Our analysis proceeds in several steps. First, we consider the effects of uncertainty on the
terms of trade. The key insight is that—in general equilibrium— uncertainty affects not only
the volatility, but also the expected terms of trade. Mathematically, the mechanism is that uncertainty impairs home agents’ ability to condition their exporting behavior on the foreign country’s state (and vice-versa). As a result, home and foreign exports covary less. In equilibrium,
the terms of trade depend on the ratio of home and foreign exports. If home and foreign exports are always proportional, the terms of trade are constant. Less coordination creates more
volatile terms of trade. The mechanism encodes the conventional wisdom that uncertainty deters risk-averse exporters from exporting.
This conventional wisdom, however, is incomplete. A fall in export covariance makes the numerator and denominator of the terms of trade covary less, while always remaining positive.
This results in a terms of trade that occasionally reaches a very high level, but never falls below
zero. When such a positive ratio varies more, its mean increases. Thus, high uncertainty, which
results in a more volatile terms of trade, also increases the expected level of the terms of trade,
making exporting more lucrative, on average.
The effect of information on the risk and the expected return from exporting permeates a broad
class of general equilibrium trade models. However, how risk and return affect the incentives
to export and which effect dominates, depends on preferences and their parameters. While
our analysis ultimately identifies fundamental features of preferences that cause information to
affect trade volumes one way or another, we begin with a specific, but commonly-used form

of preferences to identify these forces in a well-understood setting and build intuition for how
and why they arise. With constant elasticity of substitution (CES) preferences these comparative
statics simply boil down to functions of the elasticity of substitution across home and foreign
varieties. If goods are highly substitutable, the risk effect dominates and information frictions
decrease trade. When goods are substitutable, the rise in the expected terms of trade more than
offsets the increase in risk, and firms choose to export more when information is less precise. In
other words, uncertainty facilitates trade.
With other preferences outside the CES class, the same forces are at play, but may result in
different net effects on trade volume. One possibility is that the increase in the terms of trade
can reduce exports. The logic is that if I’m expecting to get lots of the foreign good back in
return for my exports, and I like a balanced consumption bundle, then I should export less
when the relative price of my good rises. Otherwise, I’ll have too much of the foreign good
to consume. Another possibility is that when the terms of trade become more uncertain, an
agent chooses to export more for purely precautionary reasons. Our general results characterize
preferences where substitution or precautionary effects dominate. We can distinguish these
well-understood substitution and precaution effects from our equilibrium terms of trade effect.
These arguments have a tight link to risk-sharing and insurance motives. We point out how the
change in covariance, which governs risk sharing, affects the mean return to trade. How uncer3

tainty actually affects trade volume depends on which of these forces—the increase in risk or increase in return—dominate. One obvious reason that uncertainty might encourage more trade
is that agents have precautionary motives to trade. Agents who export, not knowing how much
of the foreign good they will get in return, might export more to make sure they get enough of
the foreign good back. For preferences with the right type of curvature, precautionary exporting emerges. But even when preferences do not normally induce precautionary behavior, we
show that equilibrium movements in the terms of trade can induce countries to export more
in the face of more mutual uncertainty. Just like borrowing constraints can change interest rate
dynamics to induce precautionary behavior in a savings problem, equilibrium movements in
the terms of trade can induce precautionary exporting in trade models with a wide range of
non-precautionary preferences.
In other words, the terms of trade vary, in such a way as to share risk between countries (Cole
and Obstfeld, 1991). When uncertainty is low, the terms of trade vary less and pose less risk to
the exporter. But terms of trade that are not variable cannot hedge risk effectively. As uncertainty rises, and the terms of trade are less predictable, they also covary more negatively with
endowments, so as to hedge each country’s risk. This is what makes trade more attractive.
Our results rely on the assumption that there are no financial instruments or contracts that formally share risk. We relax this restriction and describe the average amount of trade in settings
where some agents can write fully state-contingent contracts and others cannot. We find that
allowing more risk-sharing works just like reducing uncertainty. If you can condition exports
on the realized price, then it is just like knowing the price. Both reduce the average amount of
trade.
Our results are most applicable to existing trading relationships. Our argument does not apply
when two countries are new trading partners and many new trading relationships are potentially being formed. The reason is that new trading relationships surely involve fixed costs to
set up. Uncertainty affects the willingness to bear those fixed costs in a way that is not captured
by this model. However, much of the world’s trade takes place between trading partners that
are already established, like the U.S. and Mexican car manufacturers. The question there is not
whether to start exporting, by how much to trade within an existing relationship. This question
is a natural starting point because the setting is simpler, but also because the answer is more
surprising.
Related Literature.
Several recent papers have measured impact of the alleviation of information frictions on international trade. Steinwender (2014) and Juhasz and Steinwender (2019) showed that transatlantic connectivity through the introduction of the telegraph lowered average prices, lowered
volatility, and increased imports of US cotton in the mid 19th century. The fact that decreases in
4

price uncertainty lead to a reduction in prices and a reduction in price volatility supports our
main mechanism. But our model changes the interpretation of their increase in trade volume. If
the reduction in uncertainty did cause a surge in trade, then it teaches us something new about
agents’ preferences.
Other papers look at different types of information frictions. In Allen (2013), Petropoulou
(2011), Rauch and Watson (2004) and Eaton, Eslava, Krizan, Kugler, and Tybout (2011), producers are uncertain about firm- or match-specific variables such as the location of the best
trading partner, the quality of their match or local demand for their specific product. These
are undoubtedly important information frictions. Our model complements these theories by
focusing on an element that these theories abstract from, the role of uncertainty about a foreign
economy.
The effect of uncertain terms of trade on risk sharing is similar to the effect of allowing international borrowing as in Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014)— increased information and
reduced uncertainty undermines the ability of countries to share risk. Unique to our economy
is that goods trade is the only vehicle for risk sharing and, hence, trade volumes can fall with
reductions in uncertainty.
In financial markets, lower uncertainty also frequently inhibits risk-sharing. The Hirshleifer
(1971) effect arises when information precludes trade in assets whose payoffs are contingent
on an outcome revealed by the information. Our effect is distinct because 1) our signals are
not public, 2) the existence of two distinct consumption goods matters, and 3) our mechanism
works through changes in the international relative price. We discuss the importance of each of
these differences when we explore risk sharing in Section 2.3.

1. A Benchmark Equilibrium Model of Trade Under Uncertainty
This section develops a simple model with two countries, stochastic nationally differentiated
endowments, and a cross-border information friction. The first two ingredients are standard ingredients of trade and international business cycle models as in Armington (1969) and Backus,
Kehoe, and Kydland (1995). The cross-border information friction is that agents in each country know their own country’s aggregate endowment, but have imperfect information about the
other country’s endowment. This information friction gives rise to aggregate uncertainty about
the terms of trade. Below we discuss the economic environment and then discuss our modeling
choices at the end of the section.

5

1.1. The Economic Environment
The economic environment is a repeated static model with the following features.
Preferences. There are two countries (x and y) and a continuum of agents within each country.
We denote individual variables with lower case and aggregates with upper case. Agents like
to consume two goods, x and y (which are nationally differentiated) and their utility flow each
period is
U (cx , cy ).

(1)

where for now we only restrict U to be increasing and concave in both goods. Section 2 solves
the model for the constant elasticity of substitution case; Section 3 characterizes the general
case.
Endowments. Each agent in the domestic country has an idiosyncratic endowment of zx units
of good x, where ln zx ∼ N (µx , σx2 ). Agents in the foreign country have an idiosyncratic endowment zy units of good y, where ln zy ∼ N (µy , σy2 ). Thus, production of each good is nationally
differentiated as in Armington (1969). Most important is that we let the mean of these distributions be independent random variables: µx ∼ N (mx , s2x ) and µy ∼ N (my , s2y ). Because they
represent the average endowment realization for each country, µx and µy are aggregate shocks.
Endowment shocks are the source of uncertainty in the model. They could equivalently be
quality or preference shocks. See Appendix B for an isomorphic model. Since trade policy is
often modeled as a preference change, this could represent policy as well. What is important is
that the shocks are aggregate, not firm-specific.
Information: At the beginning of the period, agents in country x observe their own endowment
zx and the mean of their country’s endowment µx . Likewise, agents in country y observe zy and
µy . Furthermore, agents know the distribution from which mean productivity are drawn and
the cross-sectional distribution of firm outcomes. In other words, mx , my , sx , sy , σx and σy are
common knowledge.
Agents in each country receive signals about the other countries aggregate endowment realization. Specifically, agents in country x observe a signal about the y-endowment
m̃y = µy + ηy

(2)

where ηy ∼ N (0, s̃2y ). Similarly, agents in country y observe a signal about the x-endowment
m̃x = µx + ηx

6

(3)

where ηx ∼ N (0, s̃2x ). Thus agents in each country receive an imprecise, but unbiased signal
about fundamentals in the foreign country. How precise or imprecise the signal is will depend
upon the variance of the noise s̃2y and s̃2y . Changing these variances allows us to vary fundamental uncertainty, in a continuous way, and study the response of the economy.
Let Ix denote the information set of an agent in the home country and let Iy denote the information set of a foreign agent. All country x choices will be a function of the three random
variables in the home agents’ information set: Ix = {zx , µx , m̃y }. Likewise, country y choices
depend on Iy = {zy , µy , m̃x }.
Bayesian updating. Agents in each country combine their signal (i.e. equations (2) and (3))
with their prior knowledge of the endowment distribution to form posterior beliefs. Agents
must form posterior beliefs over two outcomes: First, they must form a belief about the endowment realization in the foreign country; we will call these first-order beliefs. Second, those in
the home country must form beliefs about the foreign country’s belief about themselves; we
will call these second-order beliefs. Characterizing first- and second-order beliefs are sufficient
to characterize optimal actions.1
To compute country x’s first-order beliefs about country y’s endowment distribution, note that
by Bayes’ law, the posterior probability distribution is normal with mean m̂y and variance ŝ2y
given by

where the posterior mean is a precision weighted average of the signal and unconditional mean;
Φ is the standard normal distribution. Similarly country y’s first-order belief about county x’s

In fact, all higher orders of beliefs can matter for export choices. But, because there are only two shocks
observed by each country, the first two orders of beliefs are sufficient to characterize the entire hierarchy.

7

Here the second-order beliefs posterior mean (m̂x , m̂y ) is a precision weighted average of a
countries own realization and the unconditional mean.
A final note regarding notation. Since there is a one-to-one mapping between signals m̃ and
posterior beliefs m̂, we will use posterior beliefs as a state variable rather than using signals. This just simplifies the notational burden. Thus, we write Ix = {zx , µx , m̂y } and Iy =
{zy , µy , m̂x }.

Price and budget set. Given their information sets, agents chose how much to export, tx or
ty . In return, they receive the other countries goods at relative price p which is denominated in
units of y good. For example, an agent who exports tx units of the x goods receives ptx units of
y, for immediate consumption. Finally, we assume that there is no secondary resale market or
storage and we restrict exports and consumption to be non-negative. This implies that country
x’s budget set is:
cx  [0, zx − tx ],

and the country y budget set is:

Timing. The timing protocol is as follows: First, agents see their endowments and receive
signals about the foreign county’s endowments. Agents then they make export decisions. Thus,
they are exporting prior to knowing the actual price p. This timing protocol allows information
frictions to matter: uncertainty about the foreign country’s endowment gives rise to aggregate
uncertainty about the terms of trade and this uncertainty, in turn, feeds back into the decision
to export.
Equilibrium. An equilibrium is given by export policy functions for domestic tx (zx , µx , m̂y )
and foreign ty (zy , µy , m̂x ) countries, aggregate exports Tx (µx , m̂y ), Ty (µy , m̂x ), a perceived price
function p̃(µx , µy , m̂x , m̂y ) for each country and an actual price function p(µx , µy , m̂x , m̂y ) such
that:
1. Given perceived price functions p̃(µx , µy , m̂x , m̂y ), export policies maximize expected consumption of every firm in each country. Substituting the budget sets (8) to (11) into utility

8

E[U (cx , cy )], we can write this problem as
tx (zx , µx , m̂y ) = arg max E [U (zx − tx , p̃(µx , µy , m̂x , m̂y )tx )| Ix ]

To understand the expectations in (14) and (15), note how expected utility is computed by
integrating over my beliefs about the foreign countries endowment (the inside integral),
and then my beliefs about their beliefs about me (the outside integral).
2. The relative price p clears the international market. Since every unit of x-good exported
must be sold and paid for with y exports, and conversely, every unit of y exports must be
sold and paid for with x exports, the only price that clears the international market is the
ratio of aggregate exports:
p(µx , µy , m̂x , m̂y ) =

Ty (µy , m̂x )
Tx (µx , m̂y )

(16)

where aggregate exports in each country are
Z
Tx (µx , m̂y ) =

tx (zx , µx , m̂y )dF (zx |µx )

3. The perceived and actual price functions coincide:
p̃(µx , µy , m̂x , m̂y ) = p(µx , µy , m̂x , m̂y )

∀(µx , µy , m̂x , m̂y ).

(19)

This definition is relatively straight forward. Agents maximize utility, markets clear, and then
the mapping from endowments and signals to prices is consistent with agents expectations
about prices.

9

Aggregation. Given the model assumptions, the individual trade and consumption policies
are multiplicative in the idiosyncratic shock
tx (zx , µx , m̂y ) = zx Ψ(µx , m̂y ),

cx (zx , µx , m̂y ) = zx (1 − Ψ(µx , m̂y )),

(20)

where Ψ(·) is a function that depends only on the aggregate domestic endowment and the beliefs about aggregate foreign endowment. With this decomposition, aggregate exports become
R
2
Tx (µx , m̂y ) = fx Ψ(µx , m̂y ), where fx ≡ zx dF (zx |µx ) = eµx −σx /2 represents the aggregate fundamental. This allows to aggregate each economy and consider two representative agents, with
utility E [U (Cx , Cy )|I] over aggregate consumption, computed as
Cx (µx , m̂y ) = fx − Tx (µx , m̂y ),
Tx (µx , m̂y )
.
Cy (µx , µy , m̂x , m̂y ) =
p(µx , µy , m̂x , m̂y )

(21)
(22)

for the domestic country (and analogously for the foreign country, i.e. Ty (µy , m̂x ) = fy Ψ∗ (µy , m̂x ),
R
2
where fy ≡ zy dF (zy |µy ) = eµy −σy /2 ).
The rest of the analysis focuses on how the trade policies of the representative agents change
with uncertainty.
1.2. Discussion About the Economic Environment
Several comments regarding our modeling choices are in order. While our model makes a clear
connection between fundamental frictions and aggregate uncertainty, there are two aspects of
uncertainty discussed in the literature that we abstract from. First, uncertainty could have to
do with firm-specific conditions. While these issues are interesting, in this case uncertainty
would be idiosyncratic rather than aggregate, and, hence, its effect on aggregate trade would
only be about aggregation properties (e.g. distortions to the extensive margin of trade) than
with the uncertainty itself. A second source of uncertainty that we abstract from is related to
policy (e.g. tariffs, quotas, buy America schemes, etc.). Pierce and Schott (2016) and Handley
and Limão (2013) document how differential uncertainty around potential tariff increases and
its permanent removal influenced US-Chinese trade.
Timing is a form of friction here, which allows the information friction generate aggregate
uncertainty. Forcing firms to export, before knowing shocks or prices, lets uncertainty about
the foreign country’s endowment matter; it is the aggregate uncertainty about the terms of
trade which feeds back into the decision to export. Absent any timing friction, information
frictions and uncertainty would play no role. Realistically, this modeling choice captures the
idea that shipping lags and certain payment arrangements make exporting risky; the terms
of trade might not be known with certainty. For example, Hummels and Schaur (2010) and
10

Hummels and Schaur (2013) carefully document the time-intensive nature of trade and have
shown how it shapes the cross-sectional pattern of trade. Similarly, Antras and Foley (2015),
International Monetary Fund (2009), Asmundson, Dorsey, Khachatryan, Niculcea, and Saito
(2011), and International Monetary Fund (2011) document evidence on the cash-in-advancelike arrangements under which import transactions are often carried out.
The financial contracts that agents have access to also matters. If there exists a complete set
of risk-sharing instruments, then agents can contract on outcomes of all unknown variables
and, thus the effects of information asymmetry would disappear. In other words, some market
incompleteness is necessary for informational frictions to matter. If we want to explore the
effects of information frictions, complete markets makes that investigation impossible. When
markets are partially incomplete, results at the end show that information frictions facilitate
more risk sharing through movements in international prices than would be otherwise insured
with financial instruments.

2. Trade and Uncertainty with Constant Elasticity (CES) Preferences
This section illustrates the main argument of the paper in the context of a specific utility function. In particular, we start with a form of CES preferences which are standard in the trade and
international macro literature. Section 3 generalizes the results to cases outside of CES.
We argue the following: First, we show how uncertainty—in general equilibrium—affects both
the mean and variance of the terms of trade. Second, we characterize how the changes in the
volume of trade depend on both the changes the mean and variance of the terms of trade and
the trade elasticity.
As discussed above, we work with the following CES utility function
h
E

Cxθ

+

Cyθ

i

Ix , θ < 1.

(23)

The restriction θ < 1 is required for the function to be concave in both goods.2 Expectations are
conditional on the information set of the home country, which contains its own realization of
the aggregate shock and the signal about the realization abroad.
h 1−σ i
How to interpret this utility function? Consider a consumer with CRRA utility E C 1−σ−1 and a consumption
1/θ
bundle given by an aggregator C = Cxθ + Cyθ
. Then the CES-like case is a special case where σ + θ = 1. If
0 < θ < 1, then σ < 1 and it is a risk-averse agent. If θ < 0, then σ could be above one and it is a risk-lover agent.
Recall that the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is 1/σ.

How does uncertainty affect the stochastic properties of the terms of trade? We proceed in three
steps: how uncertainty affects the covariance of exports, how the covariance affects the average
terms of trade, and how the covariance affects the volatility in the terms of trade.
Result 1 states that more uncertainty (less precise information about the other country’s endowment) decreases the covariance between aggregate exports.
Result 1 Uncertainty reduces the covariance of aggregate exports. In a neighborhood around complete certainty (s̃2x and s̃2y equal zero), more uncertainty moves the covariance between aggregate exports
toward zero.
The intuition behind this result is easy to understand: Agents can not condition their action
on a variable that is not known to them. In our context, this implies that home agents cannot
export conditional on foreign outcomes if the if the foreign state is unknown. Thus, when the
signal precision approaches zero, the covariance of exports must be zero.
In contrast, as each country becomes less uncertain about each other, they are able to trade in a
more “sophisticated“ way. By sophisticated, we mean that the home country’s export decision
is better informed about the foreign country’s endowment and, in turn, the resulting terms of
trade. This leads to more coordinated actions and a stronger covariance in export behavior.
An example might help. In the substitute case (i.e., θ > 0), accurate information about a high
endowment realization in the foreign country suggests that foreigners will export a lot. Foreign
goods will be abundant and cheap; home goods will be relatively expensive. The expectation
of high returns to exports incentivizes agents at home to export more. Both countries export
more together, i.e., actions are positively covarying.
Figure 2 illustrates this point. The top panel illustrates the case when there is perfect information. And one sees that exports are highly correlated across countries. When one country
exports more, the other country has a strong desire to export more as well. The bottom panel
illustrates the opposite extreme. Here, neither, country has any information about the other
country and thus, their exports are independent.
The fact that information allows exports to covary underpins the following result—that in equilibrium, higher uncertainty increases both the mean and the variance of the terms of trade.

Result 2 Uncertainty increases the mean and the variance of terms of trade If the unconditional
expectations and variances of aggregate exports are kept constant, an increase in uncertainty:
1. Increases the expected terms of trade for both countries. Furthermore, if countries are symmetric,
the average terms of trade can be expressed as
E [p] = 1 + CV2 [Tx ] (1 − corr[Tx , Ty ])

(24)

where CV2 is the squared coefficient of variation and corr is the correlation.
2. Increases the volatility of the terms of trade for both countries.
The terms of trade is the price that clears the international export market. The only price that
clears that market is the ratio of exports. When home and foreign exports covary, the numerator
and denominator of the terms of trade covary. Imagine an extreme case where home and foreign
exports had perfect correlation. Home exports were exactly proportional to foreign exports, in

every state. Then the ratio of home and foreign exports would be constant. That would imply
a constant terms of trade, with zero variance. When home and foreign exports covary less, the
terms of trade becomes more volatile. This is the logic formalized in the previous result.
Figure 3 illustrates the link between the reduction in export covariance and the volatility of the
terms of trade. As the figure shows, more uncertainty means less covariance in exports and,
thus, the terms of trade are much more volatile (compare the red to the blue line).
Figure 3 also shows the link between uncertainty and the average terms of trade. Greater
uncertainty reduces export covariance, which makes the numerator and denominator of the
terms of trade covary less, while always remanding positive. This high-uncertainty case is
the red line. Notice that the high-uncertainty terms of trade occasionally spikes. These are
states where home exports are quite low, and therefore scarce and valuable. With a sufficiently
low productivity state, exports can become arbitrarily low, which makes the terms of trade
arbitrarily high. And yet, the terms of trade never fall below zero. By its nature, the process for
the terms of trade is asymmetric.
That is not to say that this is an asymmetry that systematically favors one country on the other.
When information is scarce, both countries simultaneously have high expected terms of trade. Indeed,
a high terms of trade for one country implies a low terms of trade for the other. But a high

14

expected terms of trade does not imply that the expectation of the inverse terms of trade is low.
In short, information frictions increase the expected terms of trade, for both countries.
Importantly, these results are proven, without reference to the preference specification. The
relationship between export covariance and the properties of the terms of trade is a statement
about the statistical properties of the ratio of two lognormal random variables. These statistical
properties are independent of preferences. Therefore, these two results will carry over when
we discuss the model with general preferences at the end. The first result about information
enabling correlation is not general because of its sign. In some cases, preferences will make
agents want to coordinate their exports negatively. It is always true that the only feasible level
of coordination with no information is zero covariance. But less uncertainty might enable either
positive or negative export covariance strategies, depending on preferences.
The previous results showed how uncertainty affected the mean and variance in the terms of
trade through a coordination motive. The next section connects these forces to firms’ decisions
of how much to export.
2.2. How the Terms of Trade Distribution Affects the Volume of Trade.
The second part of our argument links the expected terms of trade and its variance to the
volume of trade. There are no surprises here. Our main point is not that agents react to changes
in the mean and variance of the terms of trade in some strange way. With CES preferences,
firms export more when the return to exporting is higher and export less when exporting is
risky. So conventional wisdom about uncertainty deterring trade is correct in the CES model.
The unexpected part of the relationship between uncertainty and trade came from the previous
section, where uncertainty about others’ exports raised the expected returns to exporting one’s
own good.
The next result shows that, as one would expect, an increase in the expected terms of trade—the
return to exporting—increases the average level of exports. It also shows that higher variance
in the terms of trade deters exports, because agents are averse to the risky return of exporting.

Proposition 1 tell us how much exports will rise or fall, from a given percentage change in
the expected mean or variance of the terms of trade. It reveals many facets of the relationship
15

between the terms of trade p and trade volume. First, it tells us that an improvement in the
expected terms of trade, holding other moments equal, causes firms to export more. This is
true, for elasticity of substitution 0 < θ ≤ 1 or for θ ≥ 2. The elasticity θ governs the size of the
trade volume effect.
The variance in the terms of trade also changes with uncertainty. More variance—or risk—in
the terms of trade deters trade. And this is true, for any level of the elasticity of substitution.
Combined with (25), this result means that uncertainty deters trade through risk. This result
is the “conventional wisdom.” That is, noisier signals increase uncertainty, and that this force
deters exports.
We have identified two competing forces. Consistent with conventional wisdom, uncertainty
creates risk and this deters trade. However, uncertainty also raises the return on trade, encouraging more trade. Which force wins?
The relative strength of the mean and variance forces depends on the degree of uncertainty, as
well as the elasticity of substitution. Figure 4 illustrates this by plotting average exports of the
home country as uncertainty increases in two alternative economies: the left panel considers a
high substitution economy with θ = 0.8, which features a non-monotonic effect of uncertainty
on trade with a large decreasing segment. The right panel considers a low substitution economy
with θ = 0.3 that generates an increasing relationship between uncertainty and trade.

Appendix C for details on computation.

Figure 4: Effect of Uncertainty in Trade Depends on the Elasticity of Substitution
The mean effect is always positive, meaning that increases in the mean terms of trade always
16

increase average exports. The variance effect is always negative. More volatile terms of trade,
by itself, always deters trade. When there is a low degree of substitutability between home and
foreign goods, the trade-increasing effect is stronger. This reflects the idea that as the goods
become more complementary, then uncertainty matters more as agents want to ensure balanced
consumption bundles across goods, and as a consequence, agents export more to reach that
balance in expectation. Since the trade-increasing mean effect is stronger and the trade-reducing
variance effect is weaker for low substitutable goods, these low-θ economies are ones where
greater uncertainty promotes trade.
2.3. A Risk-Sharing Interpretation
One way of understanding why it is that uncertainty can facilitate trade is to explore why
uncertainty enables better risk-sharing. In our trade model, countries would achieve full risk
sharing if each country consistently exported half its endowment. In such a world, both countries would consume the same bundle: half of the home goods produced and half of the foreign
goods produced in that period. Consumption in both countries would be perfectly correlated.
This full risk-sharing world also achieves the maximum level of average trade. Exporting more
than half of one’s endowment, on average, never makes sense. So, if full risk sharing implies
maximum trade, the question of why uncertainty promotes trade amounts to asking why uncertainty brings the world economy closer to full risk sharing.
In finance, the argument for why uncertainty facilitates risk sharing is well-understood and is
often called the “Hirschleifer effect.” Hirschleifer considers the example of two bettors, each
with a ticket on an identical, but independent lottery. The bettors can diversify their risk by
splitting the two claims, so that if either lottery pays off, both get half the winnings. Now,
suppose that both bettors observe noisy signals about the outcome of each lottery. Now, the
bettor whose claim is on the lottery with the more favorable signal would want to keep a larger
claim on his own lottery. The signal reduces uncertainty about both lottery outcomes, but at
the same time, undermines risk-sharing. The only way both bettors will consistently share all
their risk is if they know nothing about the lottery outcomes.
The analogy between financial markets and trade is not perfect. The fact that trade involves
two or more goods, rather than two lottery tickets that both pay off identical currency units,
matters. Risk-sharing in trade takes a different form. There are no ex-ante agreements to share
output. Instead, the mechanism for international risk sharing is the movement in the terms
of trade. When one country gets a low endowment, their good is scarce; therefore their good
is valuable, and they get lots of foreign goods in return for their exports. The abundance of
foreign goods helps to insure the risk of a low endowment.
This insurance mechanisms through terms of trade is already present in worlds with perfect

17

information, as in Cole and Obstfeld (1991). What is new here is that uncertainty strengthens
the terms of trade as a risk sharing mechanism because it prevents countries from backing away
from trade in states when they would prefer not insure their trading partner. To understand the
logic of this argument, let us focus on how foreign beliefs are affected by changes in uncertainty
as illustrated by Figure 5.

Notes: Average foreign beliefs for different realizations of the domestic endowment, for various levels of
uncertainty (signal noise s̃2 ).

Figure 5: Higher uncertainty brings average foreign beliefs closer to the prior
Suppose there is a low realization of the domestic endowment µx (red solid line) and uncertainty is very low (towards the left of the figure). Then foreign firms expect domestic firms to
export little, and those are states where they would prefer to walk away from full insurance.
The full insurance action would be for foreign to export lots, home to export little, and both to
consume the same amount. But foreign agents do not want to export much at those terms. Just
like the bettor who no longer wants to share his half ticket in return for one with lower odds,
the foreign country who knows that the home endowment is low no longer wants to send lots
away for little in return.
The previous logic breaks when uncertainty is high (towards the right of the figure), as the
foreigners then do not realize that the home endowment is low as their belief moves closer
to the prior and away from the true realization. This is pure Bayesian updating. In this case,
foreign will export more in a low-endowment (µlow
x ) state, providing the home country with
18

better insurance in exactly the states when it is more needed.
Clearly, the arguments above about uncertainty increasing insurance in bad states applies in
reverse for good states. In other words, if the foreigners know that the domestic endowment
is high, they would exports lots. But as uncertainty increases, foreigners beliefs again move
towards the prior and away from the true realization, decreasing exports. However, the lack of
foreign exports under this scenario is not very costly for the home country, as they are enjoying
a high endowment anyway (this is especially true with high substitutability across foreign and
domestic goods). This asymmetry in the demands for insurance is at the core of our results,
as the average response of trade to uncertainty is mainly driven by its response at low states,
when the insurance premium is larger.
To further investigate how the relationship between uncertainty and trade varies across states,
Figure 6 plots moments of the terms of trade and the volume of exports conditional on the
realization of the domestic state µx , which is either high or low. Without loss of generality,
we fix the belief about foreign endowment to its prior value m̂y = my . We show results for
a parametrization with the preferences in (23) with a low level of substitutability θ = 0.3, for
which the average response of trade is increasing in uncertainty as shown above. As a normalization, we express results for expected terms of trade and trade volume as multiples of the
value under perfect information (zero uncertainty).

Figure 6: State-dependent responses to uncertainty
We observe that, when the domestic country has a low endowment (solid line), the expectations and volatility of the terms of trade, conditional on the domestic country’s information
set, dramatically increasing with uncertainty and in a monotonic way. In this case, given the
preferences and the low degree of substitutability, domestic exports increase with uncertainty
19

as well: the trade-increasing average effect dominates the trade-reducing volatility effect.
Now let us consider the opposite case with a high domestic endowment (dashed line). The
moments of the terms of trade are still monotonically increasing (the increase in the volatility is
not observable in the figure due to the scale), but in this case, the volatility effect dominates the
average effect and exports decrease with uncertainty. When we average across all states, the
strong positive response of exports to uncertainty in bad states dominates the weak negative
response in good states, and we recover the result that for low substitutability, uncertainty
increases trade on average.
By increasing returns to trade p when the endowment is low and reducing returns when the
endowment is high, uncertainty smooths out the utility of each country’s residents. That is
uncertainty improves risk sharing. The left panel in Figure 7 shows that the cross-country
correlation in exports decreases towards zero with higher mutual uncertainty, which illustrates
the coordination failure stated in Result 1 above. The right panel shows how the cross-country
correlation in utility—a commonly used measure of risk sharing—increases with uncertainty.

3. The General Case
Information reduces uncertainty. Conditioning on that information makes random variables
more predictable, and thus less risky. That is the nature of information. Depending on agents’
desire to undertake precautionary savings, the reduction in risk could prompt them to export
less or export more. In an equilibrium trade model, the risk effect is not the only effect of
20

information. The other effect is to reduce the expected terms of trade. That shift in the terms
of trade distribution can also move the desire to export in either direction. But the combination
of the mean effect and the variance effect reveals the total impact of information on trade. We
now examine these forces more generally.
While CES preferences are commonly-used and useful for illustrating our results and the mechanisms behind them, focusing only one type of preferences leaves open questions: Is CES a special, knife-edge case that generates unusual results? It turns out that CES is not special or knifeedge. A broad class of preferences also have the property that uncertainty promotes trade. But
not all preferences have this property. This section delineates which preferences are like CES,
in the sense that uncertainty promotes trade. We also offer practical guidance for those who
wish to pursue aggregate uncertainty as a trade barrier. Our results reveal what sorts of preferences are required for mutual uncertainty to deter trade. Finally, the general characterization
of the forces at work uncovers a mathematical foundation for our risk-sharing interpretation:
that uncertainty about trade raises the returns to trade because it facilitates better international
risk-sharing.
3.1. How Export Uncertainty Affects Terms of Trade
The results from Section 2.1, which described the relationship between trade uncertainty and
the mean and variance of the terms of trade, did not depend on any preference specification, i.e.,
CES preferences. They used the fact that the terms of trade was the ratio of the two countries’
exports. The result that countries whose exports have lower covariance have higher expected
terms of trade did use the fact that countries’ endowments are lognormally distributed. Is this
result specific to lognormal variables?
The key to the relationship between trade uncertainty and the expected terms of trade does
lie in the distributional assumptions. What is essential is that exports can be arbitrarily close
to zero, but can never be negative. If neither country can ever export a negative amount, then
the ratio of exports, which in the terms of trade, are bounded below by zero. But if there exist
states of the world where either country would choose an export amount arbitrarily close to
zero, then the ratio of exports can be arbitrarily large. If the terms of trade are Ty /Tx and Tx
can be arbitrarily close to zero, then p = Ty /Tx will occasionally be huge. The point is that the
economics of exporting make the distribution of the terms of trade skewed. There is no way
this distribution can be symmetric if it is bounded below and unbounded above. Exactly how
skewed and what firm the skewness takes, that depends on the distributions and preferences.
But the histogram of the terms of trade, for either country, will always have a bigger right tail.
Once we understand that the terms of trade are a skewed distribution, we can see why signals
about exports reduce the mean. Think of a skewed distribution as a function of a normal dis-

21

tribution. Left-skewed distributions would be a concave function of a normal – the concavity
accentuates the left tail, bad events. In this case, we have a right-skewed distribution. That can
be constructed as a convex function of a normal. Lemma 1 in the Appendix proves that the
distribution of the terms of trade must be a somewhere-convex function of a normal probability density. Now, recall that by the definition of convexity, lotteries of convex functions have
higher expected values than the median lottery realization. The more uncertain the lottery, the
higher is the expected value. Firms face a terms of trade that is like this convex lottery. The
more uncertain the lottery, the higher the expected terms of trade. The higher expected terms
of trade is what makes exporting more attractive.
For the CES case, Figure 3 illustrated the same effect in a time series plot. Recall how when
information was scarce, the terms of trade were very volatile and this resulted in occasional
spikes in the terms of trade, that brought up the average. The average terms of trade effect
originates in the asymmetry of the terms of trade distribution. This asymmetry arises naturally,
whenever exports are required to be non-negative.
What does this convex lottery look like economically? Consider trade policy uncertainty of the
following form: When you export goods, you may get very little in return. But the least you can
get is  > 0. But there is also a possibility that your good, gets through, is relatively scarce and
earns an enormous rate of return. A firm that exports more in the face of trade uncertainty is
gambling on the possibility that they are one of the few units that gets into the foreign country.
If they are, they earn enormous rents on their scarce good. This is a risky lottery and firms
dislike risk. But they understand that the odds are stacked in their favor. The more uncertain
the trade policy, the greater the possibility of winning an enormous rate of return.
3.2. How Terms of Trade Moments Affect Exports: Sufficient Statistics for Preferences
With more general preferences, the uncertainty and trade relationship can work either way:
Firms may export more or less when the expected terms of trade rise; they may export more
or less when the variance increases, or mean and variance effects can trade off differently. We
classify preferences, according to a few sufficient statistics, that allow us to say how firms with
these preferences will react to trade uncertainty and why.
In a multi-good setting, risk aversion and its related higher-order risk preferences, need to
reflect the interaction of preferences for the two goods. We encode risk attitudes with the following coefficients, which turn out to be the sufficient statistics for determining whether our
export paradox holds or not:

relative temperance.

The coefficients without tildes are the standard single-good expressions for risk aversion, prudence and temperance. The coefficients with tildes are adjusted by cross-good derivatives and
the terms of trade, to reflect the fact that there are two goods.
Before we proceed, it is useful to interpret each of these statistics, so that we understand what
economic forces we are talking about. Start with risk aversion. Note that ρy ≡ − CyUUyyy is the
standard coefficient of relative risk aversion (RRA) for the risky good y. Why adjust relative risk
aversion for the two goods? If agents do not have any preference for correlated consumption
of the two goods (Uxy ≤ 0), then consumption of y is a hedge for the risk of low consumption
of x. If agents prefer correlated consumption of both goods, then utility is very high when both
goods are abundant and very low when both are scarce. This increases utility risk. Following
Kihlstrom and Mirman (1974), when Uxy > 0 ρ̃y > ρy : the adjusting factor in the RRA amplifies
risk aversion compared to a one-good case. .
Prudence is a third derivative of preferences. It is related to the desire for precautionary savings. It governs whether agents want to export more to insure a modicum of foreign consumption or export less when the return to exporting is riskier. Following Eeckhoudt, Rey, and
Schlesinger (2007), we adjust prudence for cross-prudence in x. Given a zero-mean δ random
variable, an individual is cross-prudent in x if the lottery [(x, y + δ); (x − k, y)] is preferred to
the lottery [(x, y); (x − k, y + δ)], that is, higher x consumption dampens the detrimental effects
of risk in y. Eeckhoudt, Rey, and Schlesinger (2007) shows that cross-prudent preference for x
imply that Uxyy > 0.
Temperance is a negative fourth derivative of utility (see Eeckhoudt and Schlesinger (2006)),
which can be interpreted as a preference for risk disaggregation. Consider two zero mean random variables ε1 , ε2 , then an individual is said to be temperate if the lottery [ε1 ; ε2 ] is preferred
to the lottery [0; ε1 + ε2 ], where all outcomes of the lotteries have equal probability. A temperate
individual prefers risks to be spread across states. With multiple goods, relative temperance
also implies that some risk in each good is preferred to concentrating all risk on one good.
Now, we use these sufficient statistics to characterize the relationship between the terms of
trade moments and export volume. The first general proposition comes right out of the firm’s
first-order condition. It says that the marginal rate of substitution of a unit of home good for a
unit of foreign good should be equal to the risk-adjusted rate of exchange of the two goods. If
this were not true, a firm could improve its utility by exporting less or more.
Proposition 2 Optimal exports can be approximated as a function of the conditional mean and variance
of the terms of trade distribution, T (fx , Ex [p], Varx [p]), and are determined by equating the marginal rate
23

of substitution, evaluated at the expected terms of trade, with the risk-adjusted expected terms of trade.

What is useful about this way of expressing the first order condition is that it expresses the riskadjusted terms of trade in terms of our first two sufficient statistics, and the mean and variance
of the terms of trade. So, once we know the mean and variance of the terms of trade, and we
know these two features of preferences, we can describe the firms’ optimal export condition.
A higher expected terms of trade makes exporting more desirable, unless the term in square
brackets is negative. If risk aversion and prudence are sufficiently high, then when a firm thinks
that it will get more foreign goods back in return for each unit of home exports, it reasons that
it can send fewer exports and still have plenty of foreign goods to eat. So it exports less.
A more variable terms of trade raises the coefficient of variation, CV2x (p). This deters exporting,
(2)
unless the adjusted relative prudence term 2 − ρ̃y (Ex [p]) is negative. When this prudence term
is negative, the firm who faces a more uncertain terms of trade exports more to ensure that they
will have enough foreign good to consume, even if the rate of exchange turns out to be low.
This is an effect similar to the increase in precautionary savings observed when earnings are
more volatile in consumption/savings problems.
The next result simply differentiates (26) with respect to the mean and variance of the terms of
trade. The resulting expression clarifies how changes in the terms of trade distribution change

prudence

What we learn from this is that it clarifies many reasons why exports might rise or fall, in
response to clearer mutual information. Information can change risk, it can change whether
risk is highest when consumption is low or high, and it can change how whether risk in one
consumption good is high when the other is high or low. How a country responds to each
of these changes depends on their preferences. Specifically, it depends on their risk aversion,
temperance and prudence, as described above.
24

Why can information frictions boost trade? The main question we’re trying to answer is how
do cross-border information frictions affect trade volume. We’ve described some competing
effects: Endowment uncertainty raises the mean terms-of-trade, but also raises variance. This
leaves the question of why might these competing effects facilitate trade on average?
The mean effect of the terms of trade dominates the variance effect because of preferences. The
combination of risk aversion, prudence and temperance is just not strong enough to overcome
the higher mean returns to exporting. Under some preferences, higher risk and higher return
corresponds to less trade. But under commonly-used preferences – like CES, with elasticities
of substitution consistent with other trade facts – the net effect is more trade. This is not an
oddity of CES preferences. There is a broad class of preferences that produce the same effect.
So, might Trump’s, or any one else’s trade threats promote trade? Yes, if these threats create
mutual uncertainty about the quantity of foreigners’ exports and if preferences are not too riskaverse, too prudent or too temperate, this surge in trade is a logical equilibrium outcome.
When is uncertainty a barrier to trade? So far, we have focused on the cases where uncertainty increases trade because these are the most surprising. But in many cases, a researcher
might want to build a model where uncertainty is a barrier to trade. What preferences make
that possible?
We can use the previous proposition to define this set of preferences precisely. Suppose information increases both the mean and the variance in equal proportion. Then applying Proposition 3 tells us that average exports will fall if

The inequality requires that preferences exhibit high risk aversion (ρ˜y (1) > 1), low prudence
(ρ˜y (2) < 2), and high temperance (ρ˜y (3) > 3), or a combination of these. This condition describes
a test that can be applied to any preferences, to determine if the mean and variance effect combine to deliver a decrease in trade from a rise in uncertainty.
Conceptually, the test is this: Preferences must have the feature that uncertain terms of trade
deter, rather than promote trade, and that this force is strong enough to overcome the increase
in the expected terms of trade. High risk aversion helps. It tempers the reaction to changes
in expected terms of trade and amplifies the effect of risk. For positive adjusted risk aversion
(1)
(ρy > 0), low prudence implies a lower precautionary motive. Agents to not want to export
more in the face of risk to ensure they have some foreign goods to consume. Instead, they export
25

less to expose themselves less to the unknown rate of return. If that stepping away from risk
force is strong, then resolving uncertainty about trade will reduce the terms of trade risk and
(2)
promote more trade. Low prudence (low ρ̃y ) also helps to makes trade volumes more sensitive
to changes in terms of trade variance. Finally, high temperance helps because temperate agents
who face more risk in their consumption of one good want to shift some of that risk to another
good. In this case, exporting less is a way of shifting the composition of consumption risk.
Relating the general case and the CES case The CES results we presented earlier for change
in trade volume were just a special case of this more general result. Differentiating our CES
(1)
(2)
preferences (23) reveals that the risk aversion term is 1 − ρ̃y = θ; the prudence term is 2 − ρ̃y =
(3)
θ, and the temperance term is 3 − ρ̃y = θ, (because cross-derivatives are equal to zero and thus
the adjusted preference and standard preference parameters are equal). Substituting these θ
terms into (28), we find the following.
Corollary For CES-like preferences with θ < 1, an equal percent increase in the average and the
volatility of terms of trade inhibits exports if

Since the second term is squared and thus always positive, the only way this expression can be
negative is if θ < 0 (goods are complementary). The general preference results now shed light
on why the numerical CES results reverse at θ = 0. This is the threshold where risk-aversion,
prudence and temperance combine to make the terms-of-trade mean effect smaller than the risk
affect.
3.3. Completing the Contracting Space
So far, we have assumed away all instruments that agents might use to share international risk.
Exchange rate futures, international equity holdings, profit-sharing contracts, secondary markets, all could help to share international risk. If we included a complete set of risk-sharing
instruments, then agents could hedge the outcomes of all unknown variables and the effects of
information asymmetry would disappear. In fact, just allowing firms to write price-contingent
export contracts (where the exports fractions in (20) are ΨC (p) and Ψ∗C (p), for the domestic and
foreign country, respectively, and the subscript indicates that these are contingent contracts),
would yield outcomes identical to the full-information setting. At every price p, firms would
decide how much they would optimally send at that price. Thus, at the realized price p, every
firm sends a quantity that is equal to what they would send if they had full information and
knew that price in advance. Thus, if we want to have some meaningful role for trade uncer26

tainty, we need to step away from complete contingent export contracts.
To explore an economy with some contingent claims and some meaningful uncertainty, we
consider an environment where a fraction α of firms submit price-contingent export plans
(ΨC (p), Ψ∗C (p)) and a fraction (1 − α) of firms choose non-contingent exports (ΨN (µx ), Ψ∗N (µy ))
that depend only on their home productivity. This captures the idea that in reality, firms use
a variety of contracting arrangements for international transactions that allocate terms of trade
risk to different parties.
We eliminate any signals about the other country’s productivity (the complete uncertainty environment) and study what happens as we change the fraction α of price-contingent exporters.
The equilibrium relative price is still the ratio of foreign exports to home exports:
µy −µx + 12 (σy2 −σx2 )

p=e


×

αΨ∗C (p) + (1 − α)Ψ∗N (µy )
αΨC (p) + (1 − α)ΨN (µx )



However, the total export of each country is now α times the export of the price-contingent
firms plus 1 − α times the export amount chosen by the non-contingent firms.

Notes: Equilibrium exports in the domestic country for different fraction of agents with price-contingent contracts α ∈ [0, 1]. Figure assumes a low elasticity of substitution θ = 0.3 √
and perfect information (signal noise
s̃2 = 0). Other parameters are mx = my = 0, sx = sy = 1 and σx = σy = 2. The left panel plots the aggregate
export volume and the right panel plots exports by type of contract.

Figure 8: Completing the market reduces exports.
Having a more complete contracting space and having more information are similar: Both
cause the average export volume to fall. When we solve the model with contracts numerically
(for a low elasticity of substitution of θ = 0.3, we see that as the number of price contingent
exporters rise, the non-price contingent firms export less and the price contingent firms export
27

more. However, the responses are not very large quantitatively. Still, as the number of price
contingent exporters rise, each non-contingent firm is trading against an average foreign firm
that is more likely to have chosen a price-contingent quantity. It is like trading against a foreign
country that is better informed.The price-contingent export share rises, but is relatively flat on
a per-firm basis. The non-contingent export share falls in aggregate and each firm exports less.
The net effect is a decline in exports.
This model extension teaches us that, yes, introducing complete contingent contracts undermines the effect of asymmetric information. Yet, at the same time, completing the market and
reducing information asymmetry work almost identically to reduce trade, for the same reasons.
Conditioning exports on the outcome of a random variable and knowing that random variable
before exports are chosen are functionally equivalent.

4. Conclusions
Information frictions are often invoked as reasons for low levels of international trade. But in
an equilibrium model, the link between information friction and trade volume is not simple.
Our model shows how information also changes the expected terms of trade. It also highlights
that, in the face of risk, some types of agents may prefer to export more, to ensure they have a
sufficient amount of the foreign good to consume. This depends on agents’ preferences.
With constant elasticity of substitution (CES) preferences, information frictions impede trade
when goods are very substitutable. The decline in trade arises because the increase in risk from
lower precision information deters trade, and that risk effect is stronger than the effect on the
mean terms of trade, which encourages exporting. But with empirically plausible elasticity
parameters, the opposite is true. Information frictions encourage trade. CES preference are not
some special or anomalous case. We derive a a broad class of preferences for which similar
effects arise.
The results teach us that, if we believe that information frictions are truly an important barriers to international trade, then we must also buy in to preference assumptions that differ from
commonly-used preferences and parameters. If we believe that CES preferences with standard
elasticity parameters are a good representation of behavior, then researchers should be searching for new forms of trade frictions.

1.2. Proofs
Proof of Result 1: Uncertainty Reduces the Covariance of Aggregate Exports Proof. Part 1:
x
From derivative to covariance. The first step is to connect the derivative dT
dTy with the covariance Cov[Tx , Ty |Ix ]. Note
that Ty and µx are the only random variables for the agent in country x. A first order approximation of the policy
function Tx (Ty , µx ) yields

Tx (µx , Ty ) ≈ Tx (µx , E[Ty |Ix ]) + β (Ty − E[Ty |Ix ]) + γ (µx − mx ) = α + βTy + γµx
where α gathers all the constants. From an ex-ante perspective, Tx is a random variable. With this approximation,
the covariance with Ty is given by:
Cov[Tx , Ty ] ≈ Cov(α + βTy + γµx , Ty ) = βVar(Ty )
i.e. the own aggregate shock does not induce covariance with other countries exports. Therefore, the slope is
β=

Cov[Tx , Ty ]

With no information β = 0. With perfect information,

6= 0 ∀Ty , and therefore, β > 0. We have established that


= sign (Cov(Tx , Ty )) = sign(β)

Part 2: Continuity of the covariance in the amount of information. If the conditional distribution of terms of trade p
is a continuous function of the signal and its precision, then the continuity of Bayesian updating together with
the continuity of the integral operator ensure that any conditional expectation is continuous as well. Since the
covariance is an expectation, it is also a continuos function of the signal precision. By (i) for no information (zero
precision) the covariance is zero, and for perfect information (infinity precision) the covariance is positive. By the
continuity established in (ii), there exists an interval for precision between 0 and infinity for which the covariance
is increasing in precision. Therefore, more information increases the covariance of aggregate exports.

Proof of Result 2: Uncertainty Increases Mean and Variance of Terms of Trade Proof.
A second order approximation of p =

around the unconditional expectation of exports (E[Tx ], E[Ty ]) yields:

Furthermore, using the definition of coefficient of variation CV2 [z] =
with symmetry across countries, we obtain:

Var[z]
E[z]2

and the correlation coefficient, together

E [p] = 1 + CV2 [Tx ] (1 − corr([Tx , Ty ]))
The proof is analogous from the foreign country’s perspective, using an approximation of 1/p.

Again, using the definition of coefficient of variation and the correlation coefficient, and symmetry:
Var [p]
= CV 2 [Tx ] (1 − corr([Tx , Ty ]))
2
The proof is analogous for the foreign country.

Proof of Proposition 1 This is a special case of Proposition 3, proven below.
Proof of Lemma 1
Lemma 1 Let g(·) be the probability density function of the terms of trade and φ(·) be a normal probability density. Suppose
that g(·) = h(·) ∗ φ(·), where h is continuous. Then the function h must be somewhere convex.
Proof. The terms of trade is a ratio of two non-negative stochastic variables: Tx /Ty . Both Tx and Ty are proportional
to a log-normal variable. As such, they can take on any positive value with strictly positive probability density.
Thus, the ratio of the two variables has positive density over the positive real line. Thus, the function g(p) takes
on value zero for all p < 0.
We can thus deduce three properties on the function h: 1) If g(p) takes on value zero for all p < 0, and the normal
density is positive-valued over the whole real line, then h(p) must be zero for all p < 0. 2) For g to be a probability
density, it must be that h(p) does not fall below zero. 3) h cannot be a constant function. Since we know it takes
on value zero, it would then be zero everywhere. If that were true, g would be zero everywhere, which is not a
probability density because it does not integrate to one.
From these three properties, we can deduce that h must be somewhere convex. Suppose not. If the function h
is nowhere convex, then it is globally, weakly concave. Since it is not a constant function, there exists some x∗
such that h0 (x∗ ) 6= 0. Let m be a linear function with the slope h0 (x∗ ) and that passes x∗ . Then for all x ∈ R,
h(x) ≤ m(x). Since g is a linear function with non-zero slope, there exists p∗ such that m(p∗ ) < 0. This means that
h(p∗ ) < 0, which violates the assumption that h(p) does not fall below zero. This contradiction proves that under
the assumptions stipulated, h must be somewhere convex.

Proof of Proposition 2: Optimal exports as a function of terms of trade moments. Proof. Given
the domestic country state—endowment µx and signal about foreign endowment m̃y —the FOC of the maximization problem yields
Ex [w(p)] = 0

with

w(p) = pUy (fx − Tx (p), pTx (p)) − Ux (fx − Tx (p), pTx (p))

where the expectation operator is conditional on its information set Ex [·] = E[·|µx , m̃y ] (equal to its state), w(p) is
the marginal utility of exports, and fx = eµx is the country’s aggregate endowment.
A second order approximation of w(p) around the terms of trade conditional expectation Ex [p] gives:
1

B. A Model with Preference Shocks
In this section, we consider a related model where there are preference shocks, instead of aggregate endowment
shocks. We want to show that this related model is equivalent to the original model, once we redefine variables.
Preferences: Suppose that utility of all agents depends on preference shocks ρx and ρy
h
i
E (ρx cθx + ρy cθy )1/θ
where ln ρx ∼ N (0, s2x ) and ln ρy ∼ N (0, s2y ).
Endowments: Each agent in the domestic country has an idiosyncratic endowment of z̃x units of good x, where
ln z̃x ∼ N (mx , σx2 ). Each agent in the foreign country has an idiosyncratic endowment z̃y units of good y, where
ln z̃y ∼ N (my , σy2 ). The means of these distributions are constants (in contrast to the previous model where they
were random variables). These constants are common knowledge.
Information: All agents in country x know ρx , but not ρy . All agents in country y know ρy but not ρx . Each set of
agents can receive normally distributed signals about the unknown preference shock. They form posterior beliefs
by Bayes’ Law.
Solution: Under these new preferences, the new optimization problem becomes

t̃x = arg max E  ρx (z̃x − t̃x )θ + ρy

t̃y = arg max E

Notice that this is an identical optimization problem to the benchmark problem. The expectation measures are

1/θ
identical too because the distribution of ρx z̃x is the same as the distribution of zx . For ln(ρx z̃x ) ∼ N (mx , s2x +σx2 ).
Similarly, ln zx ∼ N (mx , s2x + σx2 ). Thus, the two problems are equivalent. One is just a change of variable of the
other.

Interpretation The one thing that is different between these two models is the interpretation of what is trade
1/θ

volume. In the second problem, Tx is ρx times trade volume. However, the trade share is identical in both
models. To see this, note that in the preference shock model, the country-x trade share is

Thus, the trade share in the preference shock model is equal to the trade share in the original model. Following the
same steps reveals that the country-y trade share is equal in both models as well. Since the aggregate supply shock
model and the preference shock model are equivalent problems, it follows that providing both countries more
information about the preference shocks must reduce the trade share, for the same reason that more information
about aggregate supply does.

C. Details of Computational Algorithm
This section describes the algorithm to compute the equilibrium, the simulation strategy and the parameter
choices.

3.1. Polynomial approximation to policy functions
Functional Basis Let {Φk }M
k=1 be a basis of polynomials with support x ∈ [a, b]. We use linear splines and
uniform nodes for the 2 states of each country.
1. Grid for state 1: Own productivity:
- In x country it is distributed µx ∼ N (mx , s2x ), where mx , sx are parameters. We construct uniform nodes
{µix }N
i=1 in the support [mx − 4sx , mx + 4sx ].
- In y country it is distributed µy ∼ N (my , s2y ), where my , sy are parameters. We construct uniform nodes
{µiy }N
i=1 in the support [my − 4sy , my + 4sy ].
2. Grid for state 2: Posterior mean of foreign productivity:
s4

- In x country, the posterior mean of foreign productivity is m̂y ∼ N (my , s̄2y ) where s̄2y = s2 +s̃
2 . However,

to use a fixed grid that does not change with the precision of information, we construct the nodes {µ̂jy }N

3.2. Computing expectations
For each country, we have two random variables, foreign productivity and second order beliefs, for which we will

evaluate expectations using Gaussian Quadrature method. For this, we must define a set of nodes {xa }a=1
and

and further moments conditions are satisfied.
• Grid for random variable 1: foreign productivity: The distribution of foreign aggregate productivity depends on the second state, the posterior mean m̂.
- In x country, for each value of the second state (the posterior mean) we have that foreign productivity
is Normal with mean equal to the posterior mean m̂jy and variance equal to the posterior variance ŝ2y =

Extreme cases
– Perfect Info: As s̃y → 0, µjy ∼ N (m̂jy , 0) = N (µjy , 0). The grid degenerates to a single point for each j:
j
µj,b
y = µy .
– No Info: As s̃y → ∞, µjy ∼ N (m̂jy , s2y ) = N (my , s̄2y ) which is equal the distribution of the posterior

mean (the second state). Clearly, s̄2y = s2 +s̃
2 → sy as well, which makes the distribution of foreign
y
y
productivity equal to the prior. However, in the code we have fixed grids for the states so that they do
not depend on signal precision. Therefore, as we reduce signal precision, the grid will not converge
to the prior. However, the simulations take care of it.

• Grid for random variable 2: second order beliefs: From the perspective of the domestic country, the second
order beliefs about the posterior mean (this is, what the domestic country thinks the posterior mean of the
foreign country is) is a Normal random variable that depends on the first state, the domestic aggregate
productivity µ.
- In the x country, for each value of the first state (aggregate productivity µix ), we have that the second order
belief is Normal with mean and variance as follows:

Then for each i = 1, ..., N , Gaussian Quadrature procedure constructs nodes for second order beliefs
a
{µi,a
x }a = 1, ..., Nq and corresponding weights {γ }a = 1, ..., Nq .

- In the y country, we have that for each value of the first state µiy the second order belief is distributed as:

Extreme cases
– Perfect Info: As s̃px → 0, then the distribution becomes degenerate at the true realizations: m̂ix ∼

N (µix , 0) ∀i and the grid becomes: m̂i,a
x = µx , a = 1, ..., Nq
– Imperfect Info: As s̃px → ∞, then the distribution becomes degenerate at the prior means m̂ix ∼
N (mx , 0) ∀i and the grid becomes m̂i,a
x = mx , a = 1, ..., N

Computational algorithm We solve the fixed point problem by iterating on the export policy functions
Ψ and Γ which are approximated using linear splines. For each country we define grids for their two states:
aggregate productivity and posterior mean of foreign productivity. We also define grids for foreign productivity
and second order beliefs that countries use to evaluate their perceived price function. Expectations with respect
to foreign productivity and second order beliefs are computed using Gaussian quadrature. Once we have solved
the fixed point problem, we simulate the repeated economy for T=100,000 periods and compute average statistics
across simulations.

3.3. Finding the fixed point
1. For reference, we organize the states as follows. For x - country: (µx , m̂y ) and for y - country: (µy , m̂x ). For
the price and other economy wide variables, we make the following convention: q(µx , m̂y , µy , m̂x ).

0 ,i,j , gk,k 0 ,i,j , hk,k 0 ,i,j , hk,k 0 ,i,j }.

• We start by solving the perfect information case and approximate the policies with the polynomials
to get the first set of coefficients. Since with perfect information m̂y = µy and m̂x = µx , we have the
following system of equations:

5. Update coefficients by i) fitting polynomials to approximate the conditional expectations and ii) using a
linear combination of the new coefficients with the previous guess.
6. Repeat steps until convergence of coefficients.
7. Once convergence is achieved, recover all variables at the firm level and at the aggregate level.

3.4. Simulation strategy and parameter choice
We solve and simulate different versions of the model: (i) full information, where both countries know their own
productivity and the other country’s productivity exactly (m̂x = µx and m̂y = µy ); (ii) no information, where
each country knows its own productivity and since neither country gets any signal, their beliefs about the other
country’s productivity are given by the unconditional distribution (m̂x = mx and m̂y = my ); and finally (iii)
noisy signals, where each country knows its own productivity and receives signals about the other country’s
productivity. In this last case we will solve and simulate the model for various levels of signal precision, always
keeping the precision symmetric across countries.
For each information model, we solve the fixed point problem by iterating on the export policy functions Ψ and
Γ which are approximated using linear splines. For each country we define grids for their two states: aggregate
productivity and posterior mean of foreign productivity. We also define grids for foreign productivity and second
order beliefs that countries use to evaluate their perceived price function. Expectations with respect to foreign
productivity and second order beliefs are computed using Gaussian quadrature.

45

Once we have solved the fixed point problem, we simulate the repeated economy for T=100,000 periods and
compute average statistics across simulations. We first draw a series of aggregate productivities and fix it across
information models. Then for each information model we generate posterior means of foreign productivity by
drawing signals centered at the realized aggregate productivities and with precision determined by the model at
hand.

Parameters Table 1 describes the parameters we use to simulate the models and how they are chosen or calibrated. The unconditional mean of aggregate productivity m and the dispersion of firm productivity σ only appear
in the solution as differences between home and foreign values. Only the differences mx − my or σx − σy affect the
export shares or the relative prices. The absolute quantities produced and traded do depend on these parameters,
but not any relative quantities or prices. Since the question of fundamental asymmetry between two countries
and its effect on trade is not the focus of this paper, we assume that there is no difference in the distribution of
√
fundamentals by imposing symmetry: mx = my and σx = σy . We normalize m = 0 and σ = 2 so that the mean
of aggregate (log) endowment is unity: E[log fx ] = mx + 21 σx2 = 1. To set volatility of the aggregate productivity
shocks, we note that it is the ratio of signal to aggregate dispersion what matters for outcomes s̃s . Since we will
vary signal precision across simulations, we assume symmetry and normalize the volatility of aggregate shocks to
unity (sx = sy = 1). We consider two values for θ ∈ {0.3, 0.8} which imply an elasticity of substitution across the
1
two consumption goods of ν = 1−θ
∈ {1.42, 5}, respectively. Finally, the precision of the signals that each country
observes about the other’s productivity s̃−2 are varied across simulations in the range [0, ∞].
