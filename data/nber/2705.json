The effect on employment, wages, and profits of different realizations of the state of nature is studied and agents' preferences concerning the implementation of a tariff are determined. The implicit contract equilibrium is shown to be constrained Pareto optimal; unanticipated tariff policy cannot be Pareto improving over free trade.\n\n",
