    "abstract": "\n\nRecent sanctions on the use of Russia\u2019s international reserve assets seem likely to reduce the appeal of US dollar reserves as a \u201cshock absorber\u201d for international payments.  But international reserves are also a means to reassure foreign investors that problematic countries will not confiscate their investments. The \u201ccollateral\u201d motive for holding dollar reserves has been enhanced by the demonstration that the United States is willing and able to sanction misbehavior.  Geopolitically risky countries now more than ever need to reassure foreign investors that their investments are safe from expropriation.  We conclude that recent events will strengthen the role of the dollar as the key international reserve currency.\n\n",
