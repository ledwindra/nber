    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper has two objectives.  First, we identify a problem with the ability of the discrete-continuous choice (DCC) framework and conditional demand functions to fully describe consumer preferences in the presence of kinked budget constraints.  Second, we propose and illustrate an alternative, preference based, method for estimating consumer responses to price changes under these conditions.  Our preference based approach yields price elasticities on the order of 0.4 and a \"utilities expenditure\" elasticity of near unity.  This research highlights the possibility that households may be more sensitive to price schedules than previously thought. It is recognizes commitments to commodities such as pools or outdoor landscaping  influence how water consumption  responds to price changes as part of the long run adjustments.\n\n",
