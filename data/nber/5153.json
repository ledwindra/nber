Reduced form regressions of mortality rates on tax data for the years 1954-1988, with controls for state, year, income, and unobserved persistence, indicate that tax increases lead to statistically significant decreases in mortality.  A 10% increase in the tax is projected to save approximately 5200 lives a year.\n\n",
