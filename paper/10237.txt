ABSTRACT
In modern knowledge driven economies, firms are increasingly aware that individual and collective
knowledge is a major factor of economic performance. The larger the firms and the stronger their
connection with technology intensive industries, the more are they likely to set up knowledge
management (KM) policies, such as promoting a culture of information and knowledge sharing (C),
motivating employees and executives to remain with the firm (R), forging alliances and partnerships
for knowledge acquisition (A), implementing written knowledge management rules (W). The French
1998-2000 Community Innovation Survey (CIS3) has surveyed the use of these four knowledge
management policies for a representative sample of manufacturing firms. The micro econometric
analysis of the survey tends to confirm that knowledge management indeed contributes significantly
to firm innovative performance and to its productivity. The impacts of adoption of the four surveyed
KM practices on firm innovative and productivity performance are not completely accounted by firm
size, industry, research & development (R&D) efforts or other factors, but persist to a sizeable extent
after controlling for all these factors.

INTRODUCTION

In the knowledge driven economy, firms are becoming more and more aware of the
fact that knowledge is a resource requiring explicit and specific management policies and
practices to be acquired, processed and exploited efficiently.2 Among other objectives, the
role of knowledge management (KM) policies and practices is to foster all types of firm
innovation, whether process or product oriented or mainly organizational, and to improve
firm productivity and its medium and long term competitive advantage. 3

As part of the pilot project initiated by OECD and Statistics Canada to study firm KM
behavior, SESSI, the statistical Agency of the French ministry of manufacturing industries,
has introduced a set of four new questions, specifically relating to important and relatively
well-defined KM policies, in the French Third Community Innovation Survey (CIS3).4
They respectively concern the existence in the firm of a written policy (W) of knowledge
management, of a culture (C) of knowledge sharing, of a policy of retention (R) of
employees and executives, and of alliances (A) and partnerships for knowledge acquisition
(see Box 1 in the Appendix).

strategies) interchangeably.

In the first section of our exploratory study, we document the diffusion of these four
KM policies among French manufacturing firms in 2000, and that of three other related
practices (also surveyed in CIS3). In the second section we provide evidence on the
complementarity of KM policies, in the sense that firms tend to adopt them jointly, and we
introduce an indicator of intensity of knowledge management (KMI). In the next two
sections we make an attempt to assess the impacts of implementing KM policies on firm
performance, controlling for a number of other factors, and investigate their
complementarity also in the sense that their impacts are cumulative. In the fourth section
we consider four indicators of firm innovative performance, the propensity and intensity in
innovating and in patenting on products, while in the fifth we look similarly at firm
productivity. We briefly conclude in the last section.

I- DIFFUSION OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT

An increasing concern…

Several reasons explain the increasing concern of firms for knowledge management.
Firms have to deal with a more complex world because of rapidly changing technologies.
Information and communication technologies (ICT) are ubiquitous, creating new needs and
requiring appropriate organizational structures, facilitating the automation of some tasks
and the outsourcing of others, supporting technological watch and improving access to

4

external knowledge. Firms have to react faster to keep their competitive edge and to be able
to build on all or part of their past experience. They are more and more aware of the fact
that their competencies largely rely on individuals and on tacit knowledge special to the
company. They are worried about the loss of skills caused by the mobility of their
personnel and are striving to motivate their employees and executives to remain within the
company, improving their career and remuneration prospects, setting up training courses
and encouraging professionalism. Firms are also aware that they cannot maintain and
develop their knowledge by relying only on internal forces. They have to form alliances
and partnerships with other firms, competitors as well as suppliers and clients, to acquire
new knowledge and expertise.

…leading to the adoption of knowledge management practices, …

Over the past years, firms have adopted different knowledge management practices. In
2000, in manufacturing industries, nearly one out of two have implemented at least one of
the four KM policies identified in the French CIS3 questionnaire (see Chart 1). More
precisely, 28% of manufacturing firms with 20 employees or more declared that they have
a culture to promote knowledge sharing (C), and almost as many (27%) that they set up an
incentive policy to keep employees and executives in the firm (R). Likewise, 23% of them
forged alliances or partnerships for knowledge acquisition (A), and significantly less (17%)
put into practice a written knowledge management policy (W).

5

…especially in large firms…

The diffusion of KM policies is much more widespread in large than in small firms
(see Chart 1). Setting up a special organization is much less critical, and more costly, in
smaller firms where information circulates more easily and informal procedures can be
efficient. In the larger firms, on the other hand, identifying the experts (the knowledge
holders) within the company is essential vis-à-vis other employees and working with
outside experts is an important asset. In 2000, almost four out of five (80%) of the firms
with 2,000 employees or more declared they had a knowledge sharing culture (C) or
alliances for knowledge acquisition (A), while only one out of five (20%) of those with 20
to 49 employees said so. Likewise, adopting a written knowledge management policy (W)
is much more frequent in the large firms: one out of two (50%) of the firms with 2,000
employees or more had one, and merely one out of ten (10%) among the smaller firms.

CHART 1 about HERE

By contrast to large firms, small firms are likely to be more dependent on the expertise
and know how of a few number of their employees, and much more concerned if they
leave. That is possibly why the adoption of a policy to retain employees in the firm (R),
even if much less common in the smaller firms than in the larger ones, is somewhat more
frequent relative to the adoption of the three other policies.

6

…and in technology intensive industries.

KM policies are also particularly widespread in the high and medium-high tech
industries, such as the pharmaceutical industry, aeronautic and space construction or
electronic component manufacturing (see Chart 2). In these industries, 40% to 45% of the
firms have implemented policies to foster knowledge sharing (C), to retain employees (R),
or to establish partnerships to acquire knowledge (A), and about 25% have adopted a
knowledge written policy (W). The diffusion of KM policies is about half less prevalent in
the low tech industries such as clothing and leather, publishing, printing and reproduction,
or home equipment.

CHART 2 about HERE

Knowledge management policies are more frequent in firms implementing new
management methods…

From 1998 to 2000, in the manufacturing industries, one firm out of five has
implemented new methods of management in the broad sense, that is, with respect to other
corporate functions, rather than just knowledge management. A good example is the
development of project-based management practices that altered existing work relations
within companies, and led to the progress of corporate cross-departmental culture.
Unsurprisingly, knowledge management is more widespread in firms that have adopted

7

such new management methods (see Table 1). Among these firms three out of four (76%)
have also implemented at least one of the four KM practices, while among firms that have
not adopted new management methods, this is the case of less than two out of five (37%).

…in firms making R&D investments, innovating and patenting…

Knowledge management is also prevalent among firms investing in research &
development (R&D), innovating and patenting. In 2000, 30% of French manufacturing
firms with 20 employees or more have invested in R&D, and 20% have patents on products
protecting part of their output, while from 1998 to 2000 about 35% have generated
innovations on products or processes. The diffusion among these firms of all four KM
practices is at least double than for the non innovating or non R&D doing firms and at least
60% higher than for the non patenting firms (see Table 1).

TABLE 1 about HERE

…and in innovating firms that use the Internet and ICT to acquire and share
information.

As part of their strategy to foster innovation, firms make specific efforts to gain better
information on technologies, products and materials, as well as about their customers,
suppliers and competitors. They find such information from a wide range of sources: from
universities and public or private research laboratories, in technical and economic

8

databases, in professional journals and conferences, trade fairs and exhibitions. Indeed,
40% of innovating firms state that they use the Internet to acquire information for their
innovating activities, 35% that they take advantage of ICT resources to share such
information between employees, and 25% that they do both. Among this last group of
firms, about 60% have a knowledge sharing culture (C) and 40% a written knowledge
management policy (W), that is twice as many as for all manufacturing firms (see Table 1).

II- COMPLEMENTARITY OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES

Firms tend to adopt knowledge management practices jointly, …

Looking at the occurrence of joint adoption of two among the four KM policies shows
that firms view them as complementary and suggests that the basic reasons of their
adoption are similar. Firms that implement one KM policy are much more likely to adopt a
second one than firms which have not implemented the first one (see Chart 3 and Table A2
in the Appendix). For instance, three out of five firms, among the 28% which have a
knowledge sharing culture (C), also implement an incentive policy to keep employees (R);
one out of two also develop partnerships to acquire knowledge (A), and about one out of
two have also a written knowledge management policy (W). On the other hand, among the
72% of firms declaring they did not have a culture of knowledge sharing, only one out of
eight set up partnerships for knowledge acquisition (A) or implement an incentive policy

9

for employees’ retention(R), and fewer than one out of sixteen have a written knowledge
policy (W).

CHART 3 about HERE

The complementarity of knowledge management practices is reflected in the high
correlations, ranging from 0.30 to 0.50, which we find between the binary indicators of
adoption of the four KM policies (see Table A3 in the Appendix). It is also confirmed by the
fact such correlations remain high when we try to control for various factors of adoption.
The partial correlations between the four KM policies indicators, conditional on size and
industry of the firms, and other control variables (i.e., the ones we also take into account in
sections III and IV when investigating the impacts of KM practices on innovation and
productivity) are still in the range of 0.15 to 0.40 (see Table A3 in the Appendix).

…which suggests the definition of a knowledge management intensity indicator.

The easiest way to take into account the complementarity of the different KM practices
is to define a KM intensity indicator (KMI) as being simply the number of adopted
practices. This indicator is thus equal to zero for a firm if the firm implements none of the
four KM policies, and respectively to one, two, three or four, if it adopts at least one
practice, two, three, or all four. It can be shown that KMI roughly corresponds to the first
component in a principal factor analysis (or multiple correspondence analysis) of the
correlation matrix (or the contingency table) of the four KM policies binary indicators. As

10

expected from the pattern of adoption of each individual practice, KM intensity increases
strongly with the size of the firm as well as with the industry technology intensiveness (see
Chart 4). It is about 2.7 in firms with 2,000 employees or more as against 0.7 in firms with
20 to 49 employees. Likewise, it averages about 1.6 in high-tech industries and about 0.7 in
low-tech intensity industries.

CHART 4 about HERE

III- KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT AND INNOVATION

Simple descriptive statistics show that the diffusion of KM practices is far from being
complete among innovating firms or firms with patents, although much more advanced
than among non innovating and non patenting firms (see Table 1). It thus makes sense to
try to estimate the specific impact of adoption of KM practices on firm innovative
performance, controlling for other (observed) factors and firm characteristics.

To assess firm innovative performance, we can use four variables from CIS3. The first
two are the “propensity to innovate” and the (product) “innovation intensity”, that is the
binary indicator of whether the firm “has introduced during the period 1998-2000 any new
or significantly improved products”, and if yes “the share of turnover from these new or
significantly improved products in the overall turnover of the firm in 2000”. The other two
variables, defined in an analogous way, are the “propensity to patent” and the “patent

11

intensity”, that is the binary indicator of whether the firm “has any valid product patent at
the end of 2000” and if yes “the share of turnover protected by patents in the overall
turnover of the firm in 2000”. The average propensities to innovate and to patent are
respectively about 35% and 20%, while the average innovation intensity is about 15% for
the innovating firms and the average patent intensity about 30% for the firms with patents
(see Table A4 in the Appendix).

The fact that the innovation and patent intensity variables can only be known for the
innovating and patenting firms is a very likely source of selectivity, which would result in
biased estimates if we were to estimate the intensity relations separately from the
propensity relations. Thus instead of simply considering independent (or seemingly
unrelated) regressions to estimate the impact of knowledge management on the innovative
performance variables, we consider jointly the propensity and intensity relations within the
framework of a generalized tobit model. The tobit model allows to correct for selectivity
biases in the intensity relation (or outcome equation) by specifying explicitly its linkage
with the propensity relation (or selection equation), both through the correlation of the
unobserved error terms in the two equations and through the sets of explanatory variables in
these equations (i.e., the KM variables and the control variables).5
5

In tobit models the selection equation is also specified as a probit (or normit) equation,
which is more appropriate for a binary dependent variable, and the outcome equation as a
linear regression, and it is assumed that the errors in these two equations are normally
distributed (with correlation rho). Since the observed innovation and patent intensity
variables are share variables, we use in fact as the dependent variable in the outcome
equation their logit transformation [i.e., z = log(y/(1-y))], so that the distribution of the
“logit-shares” be (approximately) consistent with the assumed normal distribution (and
limited to the 0 to 1 interval). We estimate the tobit model by the method of maximum

12

As control variables in the propensity and intensity equations of our tobit model
specification, we use all the available variables in CIS3 which we thought relevant: the firm
size (i.e., by means of seven binary indicators, or six in addition to the constant) and
industry (i.e., by means of fourteen binary indicators, or thirteen in addition to the
constant), R&D intensity for R&D doing firms, and three other binary indicators for
belonging to a group, for using new management methods, and for not doing R&D. We can
also introduce in the innovation and patent intensity equations another binary indicator to
control for the acquisition and sharing of information using the Internet and other ICT
tools.6 The mean and standard deviations, and more precise definitions of the control
variables, are given in Table A4 in the Appendix.

In view of the strong complementarity of KM practices, we consider in fact four
different specifications of the tobit model. In the first and simplest specification, or model
1, we use our KM intensity variable (KMI) as the only KM explanatory variable in the
propensity and intensity equations, thus assuming that the individual impacts of the four
KM practices are both (roughly) equal and linearly cumulative in the two equations. In the
next two specifications, or models 2 and 3, we introduce, instead of KMI, four binary
indicators in the propensity and intensity equations. In model 2, these indicators
respectively correspond to the use of only one, or two, or three, or all four KM practices
likehood, making sure that we reach the absolute maximum(using TSP international
version4.5). For an introduction to tobit models, see for example Greene “Econometric
Analysis” (chapter 22, in the 1993 second edition).

13

(i.e., KMI=1, 2, 3 or 4), thus still implying that the impacts of the four practices are equal
but allowing them to be more or less (non linearly) cumulative. In model 3, they simply
correspond to the separate use of each of the four KM practices (i.e., KMC=1, KMR=1,
KMA=1, KMW=1), thus allowing that the impacts of the four practices be different and
more or less cumulative. In the last and most general specification, model 4, we introduce,
in addition to the four KM practices indicators, all their possible interactions, that is eleven
other binary indicators (i.e., six “2 by 2” interactions such as KMC*KMR=1, four “3 by 3”
interactions

such

as

KMC*KMR*KMA=1,

and

the

“4

by

4”

interaction

KMC*KMR*KMA*KMW=1 which is identical to KMI=4). Clearly model 1 is nested in
the other three models, while models 2 and 3 are also nested in model 4, thus permitting us
to test whether these models provide statistically different pictures: that is whether the four
KM policies appear interchangeable and more or less cumulative, in terms of their impacts
on firm innovative performance.

TABLES 2 and 3 and CHART 5 about HERE

The estimated impacts of the KM indicators (given directly in terms of the marginal
effects on the propensity and on the intensity computed at the sample means, respectively
as a probability in % and as a share in %) are reported in Table 2 for our three first models,
and also represented graphically in Chart 5. For model 1 these impacts are all statistically

innovating firms.

14

very significant; for models 2 and 3 most of them are also very significant in the innovation
propensity and intensity equations, while only a few are in the patent propensity and
intensity equations.7 Table 2 also reports the (maximum) log-likelihood values for the first
three models, as well as for model 4, from which we can simply compute the log-likelihood
tests of model 1 against models 2, 3 and 4, and of models 2 and 3 against model 4. These
tests are reported in Table 3. They show very clearly that the more parsimonious model 1,
with the KM intensity variable, cannot be statistically rejected against the other three
models, even with a very low critical level of significance. Model 1 can thus be viewed as
the (statistically) preferred model. The marginal effects of all variables, not only KM
intensity but the R&D doing binary indicator, R&D intensity and the other control
variables, are shown for this model in Table A5 in the Appendix.

Our main results concern the statistical and economic significance of the estimated
impacts of KM intensity. Regardless of their size and industry, of their R&D efforts, of
whether they belong to a group and have implemented new management methods, firms do
tend to innovate and patent more extensively, if they have adopted KM policies. All else
equal, when KM intensity increases by one, the propensity to innovate increases by 4% at
the sample mean, that is from an average probability of 47.1% to 51.1%, and innovation
intensity increases by 1.6% for the innovating firms, from an average share of 15.8% to
7

We do not report the estimated impacts for model 4, since they are not significant, with
very few exceptions, for the eleven indicators of KM interactions (and practically not
different for the four non-interacted KM indicators from the estimated impacts in model 3).
We thus do not find evidence of complementarity (or substitutability) between the four KM
policies, in the specific sense that if a firm has already adopted one such policy the impact
on its performance of adopting another one would be higher (or weaker).

15

17.4%. Similarly the propensity to patent increases by 1.6%, from an average probability of
32.4% to 34.0%, and patenting intensity increases by 3.1% for the patenting firms, from an
average share of 30.5% to 33.6%.

These estimated impacts on firm performance of KM policies are quite substantial, and
all the more since they seem cumulative. They are not so huge, however, that one would
have to conclude that they are necessarily wrong (“ils sont trop beaux pour être vrais”), and
that they must be largely overestimated and our model badly misspecified. It is true that all
the usual reasons of econometric misspecification potentially apply: omitted control
variables and unobserved firm characteristics; endogeneity of right hand variables (i.e., of
the KM indicators themselves and of the R&D and other control variables). These problems
may be particularly serious with cross-sectional data as ours. There is not much that we can
do to address them very effectively (and convincingly) at this stage, short of being able to
gather more and better data (and preferably as panel data over a long enough period, or at
least for two cross-sections a few years apart). On the other hand, an extreme degree of
disbelief is not warranted. Even if the adoption of knowledge management has become
fashionable among firms and for a number of them mainly a shibboleth for good
management, one will expect that in average firms will not go through the various costs of
implementing KM policies unless they have some real impacts on their performance.
Anyhow, whether one views our findings with excessive skepticism or one is willing to
give them some causal meaning, even if they are likely to suffer from significant
overestimation, in both cases they remain statistically informative. At the minimum, they
reflect significant underlying positive correlations, conditional on a fair number of relevant

16

factors. Such descriptive correlations could have been negative or statistically not
significant, and they are not.

As concerns the orders of magnitude of the estimates we find for the control variables,
they look fairly reasonable on the whole, which is comforting (see Table A5). R&D doing
firms innovate and patent much more than non R&D doing firms, and they also tend to
innovate and patent more, the higher their R&D intensity. The estimated impacts of R&D
intensity, however, may seem to be on the low side, although statistically very significant.
A doubling of the average of R&D expenditures to sales ratio, which is of 1.7% for the
innovating firms and of 2% for the patenting firms, would increase innovation intensity by
only 1.2% and patenting intensity by a higher, though still modest, 5.3%. One potential
reason for these low estimates could be that instead of a measure of R&D expenditures
flow we should use a more appropriate measure of R&D capital stock. The estimated
impacts of the implementation of new management methods are statistically very
significant, as well as substantial, being in the range of the impacts found for the adoption
of KM policies (i.e., corresponding roughly to a KM intensity of 2 or 3). Lastly, there is a
clear indication that firms belonging to a group tend to patent more, and a weaker one that
they innovate more, while we find not specific impact of the use of Internet and ICT to
acquire and share information. As could be expected the impact of firm size and industry is
statistically significant and large, particularly so as concerns the impact of size on patent
propensity and intensity.8

components industry and the low tech textile industry (in terms of the marginal effects in %

IV- KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTIVITY

Besides focusing on the innovative performances of the firm, it is of interest to
investigate whether the adoption of knowledge management practices also appears to have
a specific impact, both statistically and economically significant, on labor productivity. To
do so, we use basically the same models than the ones just considered for product
innovation and patents, although with two differences. The first difference is that we can
simply rely on a linear regression specification instead of a generalized tobit. This
regression can be viewed as a simple extended production function (in log form), which is
of current use in econometric studies of R&D productivity.9 The second difference is that
we introduce (log) physical capital per employee as an additional control variable, since
these studies generally confirm that this is the major variable accounting for productivity
differences among firms.10
computed at sample means) are about 7.5% on both the innovation and patent propensities
and about 5.5% on both the innovation and patent intensities, while the differential impacts
between the lowest size group of firms of 20 to 49 employees and the largest size group of
2,000 and more employees are respectively about 10% and 30%, on the innovation and
patent propensities and about 5.5% and 25% on the corresponding intensities.
9
We have also experimented using innovation or patent intensity (and an indicator for
being innovative or patenting) in the production function production, instead of R&D
intensity (and an indicator for doing R&D). The results are basically the same, with R&D
performing marginally better. For a review of econometric problems encountered in firm
level econometric studies on R&D productivity, in particular that of large discrepancies
between cross-sectional and time-series estimates on panel data, see the survey, still useful
though now incomplete, by Mairesse and Sassenou, 1991.
10
We had to merge CIS3 with the French Survey of Enterprises in 2000 (“Enquête
Annuelle d’Entreprise 2000”) in order to be able to measure physical capital by the gross

18

CHART 6 about here

The results of estimation and tests for productivity are reported in the last column of
Tables 2, 3 and A5 and in Chart 6. The tests of the four models, corresponding to the
different ways of entering knowledge management in the productivity equation, tell us a
somewhat different story than for innovation and patenting. Model 3, in which the four KM
policy indicators are included separately, performs slightly better than the others: It is
statistically different from model 1 using our simple measure of KM intensity, but it is not
statistically different from the less parsimonious model 4 with fully interacted KM policy
indicators (while model 2 differs statistically from model 4, not from model 1). It is clear
that the four KM policies do not appear exchangeable anymore and remain only partly
cumulative. All else being equal, labor productivity is higher, and very significantly so, by
about 10% for firms implementing a policy to retain executives and employees (R) than for
firms which do not, and by about 5% for firms promoting a culture of knowledge sharing
(C) than for firms which do not. At the opposite, all else equal, labor productivity is not
statistically different (or barely so) between firms declaring that they have or that they have

book value of fixed assets, and also to measure labor productivity in terms of value added
per employee (rather than total turnover per employee). This is why the “labor productivity
sample” (3419 firms) is smaller by a few firms than the “full sample” (3474 firms) of the
previous sections. Note that using this sample we could have also included physical capital
intensity as an additional control variable in the innovation and patenting equations of
section III. When we do so, however, our results remain basically unchanged; if anything,
the estimated impacts of KM intensity on patenting propensity and intensity are slightly
less significant and lower.

19

not a policy to establish alliances to acquire knowledge (A), and a knowledge written
policy (W).

The estimated elasticities of the physical capital intensity and of R&D intensity,
though somewhat on the low side, are consistent with what could be expected from
previous productivity studies (see Table A5 in the Appendix). Contrary to what we find for
innovation and patenting, the estimated impact of the implementation of new management
methods on productivity is barely statistically significant and if anything negative.

V- TO CONCLUDE

In this exploratory study of the diffusion and impact on firm performance of four
specific knowledge management (KM) policies for a large representative sample of French
manufacturing firms, we have found not very surprising results and more surprising ones
(at least to us), some of them satisfactory, but others puzzling.

Among the expected results, we substantiate the fact that the diffusion of the four KM
policies is much more advanced in the larger firms and in the technology intensive
industries, and the fact that these practices appear highly complementary, firms tending to
adopt them jointly. Among the less obvious but satisfactory findings, we observe that the
impacts of KM practices on firm performance are in general statistically and economically
significant and more or less cumulative, even controlling for firm size, industry and other

20

important factors such as R&D intensity and physical capital intensity. It is also satisfactory
to find that these estimated impacts are on the high side, but still in the range of values that
one is a priori ready to accept as not implausible.

Less desirable and somewhat puzzling is the observation that our four specific KM
practices are not only cumulative, but also apparently interchangeable in the case of
innovative performance. In this case the model with KM intensity, simply defined as the
number, varying from zero to four, of KM practices implemented by firms, performs
statistically as well as the one with the four individual KM indicators. An explanation may
be found in the collinearity (or high correlation) of these indicators naturally reflecting the
complementarity of KM practices, but also in the intrinsic crudeness and subjective nature
of such binary survey reported indicators, which is a likely source of measurement errors
(in the form of a misclassification across the yes and no answers). Also rather puzzling is
the finding that the estimated impacts of implementing new management methods in the
broad sense are about as large as the impacts of KM practices on firm innovative
performance, while they are if anything negative on firm productivity, unlike the positive
significant impacts of employees retention and knowledge sharing culture policies (R and
C).

21

Further studies are of course needed to confirm, better understand and enrich these
exploratory results.11 It is clear that our econometric evidence of a significant impact of
knowledge management on firm performance does not necessarily mean causality, although
such a causal link is not a priori unlikely. It is also clear that our estimates are basically
cross-sectional estimates and as such susceptible to various heterogeneity biases. Although
they are not economically unreasonable, the orders of magnitude of the estimated impacts
we find seem indeed rather high; but, even if they were to be divided by two, or even by
three, they still would remain appreciable.

In a recent micro econometric study based on information from a specific survey on

“Firm Competencies to Innovate” for French manufacturing, merged with the innovation
data from CIS2 (concerning the period 1994-1996), Galia and Legros find results which
overall seem in accordance with ours.

BOX 1
Knowledge Management in the Third Community Innovation Survey (CIS3)
for French manufacturing

The Third Community Innovation Survey, which covers the period 1998-2000, was
conducted in France jointly by INSEE and the Statistical Departments of the three
Ministries respectively in charge of the manufacturing industries, agriculture, and
commercial, financial and research and engineering services. It is a mandatory survey. The
SESSI (Service des Etudes et Statistiques Industrielles) was in charge of surveying some
5500 manufacturing firms with 20 employees or more. Firms have been chosen randomly,
using the business register based on legal units and according to the following stratified
sampling design:
•

all firms over 500 employees

•

1/2 for firms from 100 to 499 employees

•

1/4 for firms from 50 to 99 employees

•

1/8 for firms from 20 to 49 employees

The rate of response was of 86%, corresponding to an overall coverage of 89% of the
total turnover for the manufacturing sector in 2000. See below the paragraph on the
weighting of the results presented in this study.

23

The four questions on Knowledge Management…

Four questions directly referring to firm policies and strategies of knowledge
management have been introduced in the French CIS3 for manufacturing industries. These
questions have been chosen as particularly meaningful among the 23 questions on
knowledge management considered in the pilot survey by Statistics Canada (L. Earl and F.
Gault, 2003) They are the following:
- By the end of 2000, did your firm have a written knowledge management policy? (W)
- Did it have a culture to promote knowledge sharing? (C)
- Did it put into practice an incentive policy to retain employees and executives in
firm? (R)
- Did it forge partnerships or alliances for knowledge acquisition? (A)

…and three other related ones.

The French CIS3 for manufacturing industries also includes three other questions
which can be related to the KM policies. They concern the adoption of new management
practices in general and the use of Internet and ICT to acquire and share information for
innovation purposes. They are the following:
- From 1998 to 2000, did your company implement new managerial methods?
- Do you use the Internet to acquire information (from the different possible sources,
whether internal or external, private or public) for your innovating activities?

24

- Do employees use ICT resources (data updates, Intranet, and so on) to share
information from external sources?
Note that, since the answers to these last two questions on Internet and ICT are
strongly correlated, we pooled them as one binary indicator in our econometric analysis.
Note also that these questions were only asked to the innovating firms (that is, in
accordance to the definitions of the OECD Oslo Manual, firms which have introduced new
or significantly improved products or production processes during the 1998-2000 period).

Weighting of Results

The descriptive statistics shown in Charts 1 to 4 and Table 1 in the text, and in
Tables A1 and A2 in the Appendix, are weighted to be representative of the manufacturing
sector (i.e., in order to take into account the differences by size and industry in the sampling
and response rates). However, the descriptive statistics in Table A4 in the Appendix and the
econometric estimates presented in Charts 5 and 6 and Tables 2 and 3 in the text, as well as
in Tables A3 to A5 in the Appendix, are not weighted. We have simply introduced size and
industry indicators in all the estimated econometric models. We have also checked that the
weighted econometric estimates were not meaningfully different from the unweighted ones.

Definitions
The intensity of knowledge management is equal to zero when the firm implements none of
the four KM practices; and to 1, 2, 3 or 4 respectively, when the firm implements at least
one, two, three, or all four.
The classification of industry by technological intensity is mainly based on the average
ratio of R&D to output of the industry at the CITI rev2 level (OECD, 1997). See Table A1,
in the Appendix for some indications about the link between classification of industries by
technological intensity and the NES36 classification.
Lecture: Firms with more than 2,000 employees have a knowledge management intensity
of 2.7; firms belonging to the high-intensive industries have a knowledge management
intensity of 1.6.
Scope: Manufacturing firms with 20 employees or more (excluding the food industry),
weighted results.

The generalized tobit models for innovation (columns 1 and 2) and patents (columns 3 and
4) are estimated by the method of maximum likelihood. The linear regression model for
labor productivity (column 5) is estimated by ordinary least squares (which coincides with
maximum likelihood for the estimated coefficients and practically for their standard errors)
***, **, and * respectively indicate that the estimated coefficients are statistically

35

significant at the 1%, 5% or 10% confidence level. These coefficients are directly given in
the table in terms of the marginal effects computed at the sample means, respectively as a
probability in % for the propensity to innovate and to patent equations, and as a share in %
for the corresponding intensity equations. These estimated coefficients coincide with the
(constant) marginal effects for the productivity equation. Rho is the estimated correlation
coefficient between the error terms of the propensity and intensity equations of the
generalized tobit models
All equations also include 14 industry indicators and 7 firm size indicators and the other
relevant factors as defined in TableA4 in the Appendix. The coefficients (in terms of
marginal effects) of all these other relevant factors are given in the Table A5 in the
Appendix for the Model 1.

Definitions:
This table is based on the NES36 classification, corresponding to 14 different
manufacturing industries. The classification of industry by technological intensity is mainly
based on the average ratio of R&D to output of the industry at the CITI rev2 level (OECD,
1997). An approximate correspondence to the NES114 is possible but not to the NES36, the

39

NES36 industries containing NES114 sub- industries of different technological intensity.
To roughly indicate the degree of technological intensity of the 14 NES36 manufacturing
industries, the existence of sub-industry of different technological intensity is noted in
parentheses, where HT, MH, ML and LT stand respectively for High-Tech., Medium High
tech., Medium Low tech. and Low Tech..

The (raw) correlation between the binary indicator of firm adoption of a culture of
knowledge sharing (C) and incentive policy to retain employees (R) is of 0.47, while the
partial correlation is of 0.36, after (linearly) controlling for size, industry and other factors
(included as control factors in the propensity equation- see Table A5 in the Appendix).
Scope: Manufacturing firms with 20 employees or more (excluding the food industry),

Standard errors in parenthesis. Labor productivity, physical capital intensity and R&D
intensity are introduced in log on the different models. In this table, for these three
variables, we give the exponential of the mean of the log. The standard error corresponds to
the log variable.

Definitions: The propensity to innovate variable is measured by the proportion of firms
earning a turnover from new or significantly changed products on the market from 1998 to
2000 (in %).
The propensity to patent variable is measured by the proportion of firms having patented
products in 2000 (in %).
The innovation intensity variable is measured by the logit function of the share ( or “logitshare”), in the firm’s total turnover in 2000, of the turnover from new or significantly
changed products introduced on the market from 1998 to 2000 (in %).
The patent intensity variable is measured by the by the logit function of the share ( or
“logit-share”), in the firm’s total turnover in 2000, of the patented products sales (in %).
The labor Productivity variable is measured by the logarithm of the firm’s value added to
the total number of employees in 2000 (in K€ per person).
The physical capital intensity variable is measured by the logarithm of the firm’s gross
book value to the total number employees in 2000 (in K€ per person).
The R&D intensity variable is measured by the logarithm of the share of the firm’s R&D
expenditures in the firm’s total turnover in 2000.
The knowledge management intensity variable is measured by the number (from 0 to four)
of knowledge management practices implemented by firms (see definition in chart 3).
The group, new management methods, Internet and ICT for external data sharing use, and
non R&D doing variables are binary 0-1 indicators (respectively equal to 1 if the firms
belong to a group, have adopted new management methods, Internet and ICT for external
data sharing use, or are NOT doing R&D).
The 14 industry and 7 size binary indicators are defined on the base of the classification of
industries shown in Table A1 in the Appendix and of the groupings by total number of
employees used in Chart 1 in the text.
Scope: Manufacturing companies with 20 employees or more (excluding the food
industry), not weighted.
