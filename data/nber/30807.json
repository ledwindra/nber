    "abstract": "\n\nNon-parametric gravity as de\ufb01ned in this paper encompasses previous parametric forms. The model generates non-parametric su\ufb03cient statistics for arbitrage gains from trade and terms of trade, and a non-parametric elasticity of terms of trade with respect to supply. For world manufacturing trade 2000-2014, China\u2019s gains rose 2%yearly and terms of trade fell 8.3%. US gains fell 2% yearly and terms of trade rose 5.5%. Counterfactual industrial policy that raises US 2014 world sales share by 1% lowers US gains per unit 0.72%, leaving a surplus of 0.28%. A novel minimum distance estimator generates the CES trade elasticity required.\n\n",
