Is Smoking Inferior? Evidence from Variation in the Earned Income Tax Credit

NBER Working Paper No. 20097
May 2014
JEL No. H2,I1
ABSTRACT
In this paper we estimate the causal income elasticity of smoking participation, cessation, and cigarette
demand conditional upon participation. Using an instrumental variables (IV) estimation strategy we
find that smoking appears to be a normal good among low-income adults: higher instrumented income
is associated with an increase in the number of cigarettes consumed and a decrease in smoking cessation.
The magnitude and direction of the changes in the income coefficients from our OLS to IV estimates
are consistent with the hypothesis that correlational estimates between income and smoking related
outcomes are biased by unobservable characteristics that differentiate higher income smokers from
lower income smokers.

I. Introduction
Prices and income are central to the standard economic model of consumer demand.
Estimates of the price-elasticity of cigarette demand continue to attract a great deal of
attention because of their relevance to the role of excise taxes in tobacco control. In
contrast, estimates of the income-elasticity of cigarette demand currently seem to attract
much less attention from either economists or policy makers, and income is often considered
only tangentially as a control variable or in the context of the regressivity of cigarette
taxation.1 In this paper, we focus on estimating the ‘causal income-elasticity,’ that is, the
causal effect of income on smoking, for lower-income adults. We use data from multiple
waves between 1993 and 2007 of the Current Population Survey (CPS) Tobacco Use
Supplements (TUS) matched to the CPS Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC).
To address the potential endogeneity between income and smoking we adopt an instrumental
variables (IV) identification strategy, where our IV is based on changes in the benefit
parameters of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).
The income-elasticity of cigarette demand deserves more attention in its own right as
an interesting example of the basic economics of health behaviors. Existing evidence seems
to suggest that whether the income elasticity is positive or negative varies systematically
across time periods, countries, and demographic groups. For high-income countries like the
U.S. the sign appears to have reversed over time, so that cigarettes appear to have switched
from being a normal good to an inferior good (Wasserman et al. 1991; Cheng and Kenkel
2010). Across the world the prevalence of smoking tends to be higher in low- and
middle-income countries than in high-income countries, but within low- and middle-income
countries, cigarettes might still be a normal good (Bobak et al. 2000; Peck 2011). In the
Grossman (1972) model, the demand for a good like cigarettes is partly derived from the
demand for health, so these patterns might reflect the relative income elasticities of the

Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 3

demand for smoking as a pleasurable activity versus the income elasticity of the demand for
health. Alternatively, the empirical patterns might reflect endogeneity bias. Studies that
estimate the income-elasticity of smoking typically treat income as exogenous, but sometimes
note their skepticism about this assumption. For example, after reporting their estimate that
cigarettes are an inferior good, Colman and Remler (2008) immediately mention possible
omitted variable biases and admit that it might seem unlikely that smoking would really
decline if income were exogenously increased. The focus of our paper is on the fundamental
empirical question: Do the observed patterns reflect the causal impact of an exogenous
increase of income on smoking?
The income-elasticity of cigarette demand also deserves more attention because of its
policy relevance. The association between low-income and smoking in the U.S. is strong: in
2010 33 percent of adults earning less than $15,000 per year smoked, compared to only 11
percent of adults earning more than $50,000 per year.2 If this association at least in part
reflects causation, anti-poverty programs could help reduce smoking and prevent
smoking-related diseases. Knowing the impact of an exogenous increase of income on
cigarette demand thus allows more complete policy analysis of anti-poverty programs that
takes into account smoking-related changes in health. The causal income-elasticity of
cigarette demand is also related to policy concerns about disparities in health associated with
socioeconomic status more broadly. In an influential paper in medical sociology and public
health, Link and Phelan (1995) argue that social conditions are indeed the “fundamental
causes of disease.” The direct implication is that a wide range of policies from the minimum
wage laws to head-start programs intended to reduce socioeconomic disparities can also help
reduce health disparities (Phelan, Link, and Tehranifar 2010). Of course, income differences
are only one aspect of socioeconomic status, and as Deaton (2002) points out: “Quite
different policies are called for to deal with health in relation to income, education, or social

Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 4

class.” However, whether the focus is narrowly on income or more broadly on
socioeconomic status, the policy implications hinge crucially on whether the observed
associations with health-related behaviors like smoking are causal. An alternative
explanation is that unobserved individual-level heterogeneity, such as differences in risk- and
time-preference, might be the true underlying cause of the individual’s income and smoking.
Unless anti-poverty programs also change these preferences, other public health policies will
be needed to reduce smoking among the low-income population.3
Our study of the causal effect of income on smoking parallels research on the causal
nature of the schooling-smoking gradient (Kenkel, Lillard, and Mathios 2006; Currie and
Moretti 2003; de Walque 2007; Aizer and Stroud 2010), the schooling-health gradient more
broadly (Cutler and Lleras-Muney 2010; Grossman 2006), and the income-health gradient
(Deaton 2004). Our new estimates of the causal effects of income on smoking also
complement research on the impact of the business cycle on health behaviors and outcomes
(Ruhm 2005, 2000). Moreover, our estimates quantify the potential of income maintenance
and anti-poverty programs as policy tools to reduce smoking.
In order to identify the causal effect of income on smoking, we implement an
instrumental variable identification strategy that exploits exogenous changes in income
generated by changes in the parameters of federal and state EITC programs. Targeted at
low-income working families, the EITC is the nation’s second largest antipoverty program
for the non-elderly, with federal expenditures of $57.9 billion and 25.9 million recipients in
tax year 2009 (IRS 2011). Over our study time period (1993 – 2007), the federal government
significantly expanded the EITC program. For example, the maximum federal EITC benefit
available to taxpayers with two or more children increased in real terms from $1,678 in 1993
to $3,650 in 2007.4 Over our study period a number of states also launched their own EITC
programs, and many state programs adjusted their credits both upward and downward. As a

Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 5

result, the instrument we use –the state/year maximum value of EITC benefits – shows
substantial variation. Our IV strategy is similar to the strategy employed by Schmeiser (2009,
2012) to examine the effect of income and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,
respectively, on obesity.
Our IV estimates differ substantially from Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimates.
Broadly similar to previous research, our OLS estimates suggest that smoking is inferior: the
total elasticity of demand with respect to income is -0.078, and the income elasticity of
smoking cessation is positive. In contrast, our IV estimates imply that smoking is a normal
good: the total elasticity of cigarette demand with respect to income is 5.62, and the income
elasticity of smoking cessation is negative. The direction of the changes in the coefficients
supports the argument that OLS estimates of the effect of income on smoking are
substantially biased by the unobservable characteristics of higher-income smokers.

II. Background
To set the stage for our empirical study, it is useful to briefly go back to the basics of
the standard model of consumer demand. One of the most basic comparative static exercises
is the income expansion path and the related Engel curves that trace out how the consumption
bundle changes as income increases (for example,Varian 1978, pp.87-88). Under homothetic
preferences the income expansion path is a straight line and all income-elasticities are unitary.
Under more general preferences, the income expansion path can bend towards one good or
another, or in the case of an inferior good, it can even bend backwards. The comparative
static exercise is a thought experiment about what we can learn about an individual’s
preferences by observing consumption choices at different incomes. In other words, the
standard model focuses on the causal income-elasticity that shows how consumption changes
in response to an exogenous change in income.

Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 6

However, empirical demand studies do not typically use data that correspond to the
thought experiment just described. Cross-sectional surveys, such as the CPS, provide data on
the smoking behaviors of different consumers who have different levels of income.
Heterogeneity makes it difficult to use these data to learn about an individual consumer’s
preferences for smoking at exogenously different income levels. For example, as mentioned
above, higher-income consumers might tend to have different risk- and time-preferences,
which play central roles in more complete models of health-related and addictive
consumption (Grossman 1972; Becker and Murphy 1988). Higher-income individuals may
associate a social stigma with smoking based on their peer groups, whereas lower income
individuals are less likely to stigmatize smoking (Bell et al. 2010). This differential stigma
by income may further bias the OLS estimates found in previous studies. Another possibility
is that the smoking behaviors of different consumers who have different levels of income
simply reflect differences in tastes for smoking as a pleasurable activity. Economic theory
does not provide much guidance as to why tastes for smoking might vary with income, so a
priori it is hard to predict how this might bias estimates of the causal income-elasticity.
To the best of our knowledge, few previous empirical studies make serious efforts to
control for individual heterogeneity or other sources of endogeneity bias, when estimating the
income-elasticity of smoking behaviors. The exceptions are three recent papers studying the
effect of the EITC expansion on women’s smoking behavior exclusively. The first, Averett
and Wang (forthcoming), use a difference-in-difference-in-differences with fixed effects
estimation procedure, exploiting variation in EITC credits of mothers with two and more than
two children, before and after the 1993 EITC expansion, and amongst mothers with high and
low education levels. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979, they find that the
probability of smoking for mothers with two or more children declined relative to those with
only one child. Second, Cowan and Tefft (2012) use a difference-in-differences strategy

Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 7

before and after the 1993 EITC expansion with data from the Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System to show that the expansion decreased the likelihood of smoking for
young, single, low-educated women. Third, Hoynes, Miller, and Simon (2012) also employs
a difference-in-differences strategy for two EITC expansions with data from the U.S. Vital
Statistics to find that an increase in EITC income lowers the incidence of low birth weights
for single, low-educated mothers. This operates largely through an increase in pre-natal care
and a decrease in smoking for low-educated mothers.
The following analysis differentiates itself from the previous work along four
dimensions. First, this study uses an IV identification strategy to investigate the impact of
income on smoking behaviors, exploiting intensive margin shifts in state-year EITC
maximum payments. Second, we are the first to examine smoking behavior of all
low-income individuals. Third, this paper explores three dependent variables: probability of
cessation, propensity to smoke, and the number of cigarettes consumed, allowing us to
estimate the elasticity of income for multiple smoking behaviors. Fourth, we are the first to
document a causal relationship between income and smoking using the pairing of the Current
Population Survey (CPS) Tobacco Use Supplement (TUS) and the CPS Annual Social and
Economic Supplement (ASEC).
A. The Earned Income Tax Credit Program
To address potential endogeneity bias in estimates of the income-elasticity of
smoking, we use an IV approach, where the EITC provides an exogenous source of variation
in income. The EITC is a wage supplement program for low-income workers administered
through the tax system. The EITC is the second largest antipoverty program for the
non-elderly, having only recently been surpassed in annual expenditures by the Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The EITC functions as a wage supplement, accruing
only to households with eligible labor earnings. The precise benefit amounts depend on

Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 8

earnings, marital status, and the number of eligible children in the tax unit. The program has
three earnings ranges used to calculate benefits: the phase-in, plateau, and phase-out ranges.
Total benefits rise at a fixed rate with additional wage earnings in the phase-in range of the
credit. Once the maximum benefit amount is reached, benefits remain constant for wage
earnings in the plateau region, and then decline at a fixed rate for earnings in the phase-out
region until the benefit reaches a value of zero.
The benefit amount varies substantially by the number of eligible children in the tax
unit, and the relative value of benefits by number of children has also varied substantially
over the past 25 years. As the EITC has evolved, the schedules for families without children,
families with one child, and families with two or more children have changed at different
times. In addition to the federal EITC, 22 states and the District of Columbia provide their
own supplemental EITC programs for tax year 2011. Their credits are set at a percentage of
the federal EITC benefit and vary in their refund-ability. For example, New York State has a
credit set at 30 percent of the federal EITC that is fully refundable. Thus a family earning the
maximum federal benefit of $5,751 for tax year 2011 would also receive $1,725 from New
York State.5 Since the first state EITC supplement was implemented in 1986 these programs
have been implemented in 24 states at varying times, with varying credits, and varying
changes in the credit rate. Figure 1 shows how the average real combined maximum of state
and federal benefits by number of children varies over our study period.
Expansions of the state and federal EITC provide a plausibly exogenous source of
variation in income through their effect on labor supply incentives and have been used in
previous studies as instruments for income and program participation (Schmeiser 2009,
2012). The theoretical effect of the EITC on the decision to work for unmarried individuals
is unambiguously positive. For married women the effect of the EITC on their decision to
enter or exit the labor force is more ambiguous given the interaction with their husband’s

Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 9

labor supply. For those already in the labor force the theoretical effect of the EITC on hours
worked depends on the region of the EITC into which the worker’s labor earnings place them.
The three distinct credit regions of the federal EITC program — the phase-in, plateau, and
phase-out — each yield their own labor supply incentives for workers already in the labor
force. In the phase-in region the EITC supplements wages, so as long as the substitution
effect from higher effective wages dominates the income effect, people will desire to increase
hours worked. In the plateau region the EITC simply increases income without altering the
wage rate and thus only the income effect exists, resulting in a desire to reduce hours worked.
In the phase-out region of the EITC both the income and substitution effect induce workers to
desire fewer hours as the credit is reduced for every additional dollar of labor earnings.
The different regions of the EITC, with their differential effects on desired hours of
work, raise the theoretical possibility that the use of the EITC as an instrument violates the
monotonicity assumption required of an IV. With a sufficiently high elasticity of labor
supply and the ability to choose the number of hours worked it is possible that an expansion
of the EITC could actually reduce overall income. For example, an individual who becomes
eligible for the EITC through an expansion of the credit and is in the phase-out range could
potentially be induced to reduce hours sufficiently to reduce their total income. However, the
empirical research into the effect of the EITC on labor supply provides little evidence that the
credit has much effect on the intensive margin of labor supply (hours worked) and no
evidence of an elasticity of labor supply sufficiently high to induce a reduction in overall
income.6
A wide range of studies that have evaluated past EITC expansions using a variety of
econometric techniques conclude that the credit is an effective means of increasing the labor
supply and thus the income of low-wage workers (Liebman 1998; Eissa and Liebman 1996;
Meyer and Rosenbaum 2001; Hotz and Scholz 2006). The majority of these studies find that

Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 10

the effect of the EITC on income is driven by changes along the extensive margin
(individuals entering or exiting the labor market), with large increases in the labor force
participation of single women with children. However, there is some evidence that the EITC
reduces participation by married women (Eissa and Hoynes 2006). The EITC has also been
found in some studies to generate variation in labor supply at the intensive margin (number of
hours worked by those currently in the labor force). For example, Eissa and Hoynes (2006)
find a modest one to four percent reduction in annual hours worked amongst married women;
however, they find no evidence of a reduction in hours for single women, even those in the
phase-out region of the credit. Eissa and Liebman (1996) find that the 1986 EITC expansion
resulted in a small increase in the hours worked for single women already in the labor force.
When the effect on hours worked is dissagregated by region of the EITC they find no
reduction in hours worked for women in the phase-out region. When individuals have greater
control over their hours worked and total earnings there is more evidence of responsiveness:
Saez (2009) finds bunching at the first EITC kink-point by the self-employed. As with all
IVs, our results represent a local average treatment effect (LATE) specific to these
low-income families that respond to the EITC.
III. Data
We use data from multiple waves of the Current Population Survey (CPS) Tobacco
Use Supplement (TUS) which we then match to the CPS Annual Social and Economic
Supplement (ASEC). The TUS contains detailed information on current and previous year
smoking status, smoking cessation, and tobacco consumption. The ASEC contains detailed
information on income, employment, and family demographics. This gives us the ability to
both include specifics of individuals' smoking behavior and specific information regarding all
individuals' incomes and demographics in determining how income affects smoking
decisions. Additionally, we construct a database of average cigarette prices by state and year

Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 11

from Orzechowski and Walker’s The Tax Burden on Tobacco: Historical Compilation
(2006). To create our IV, we use information from the University of Kentucky’s Center for
Poverty Research on state and federal maximum EITC benefits for families with zero, one, or
two or more children (University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research 2011).7 We use
state and year variation in EITC benefits by number of children as our instrumental variable
for income. We match the appropriate maximum benefit value to the individuals in our
sample by state of residence, survey year, and the number of own children in their family.
We further recognize that by using the EITC as an instrument, we look specifically at
transitory income, and thus are limited to estimating short-run income elasticities.
Pairing TUS and ASEC data gives us eight years of repeated cross sections, covering
all 50 states and the District of Columbia for the following years: 1993, 1996, 1999, 2001,
2002, 2003, 2006, and 2007. In order to obtain respondents from this vast geography across
the United States, the CPS oversamples individuals in small states. In addition, there are
systematic differences in response rates amongst different populations. Thus, we use sample
weights throughout our study in order to control for the complex sampling and stratification
used in the collection of the CPS data.
Because the EITC is only a useful IV for potentially eligible individuals, we limit our
sample to low-income adults, defined as adults who have a family income under $45,000 in
2011 dollars. This value is just beyond the end of the EITC phase-out region for families
with two or more eligible children.8 Because our sample is restricted to adults, we focus on
smoking participation, the number of cigarettes smoked per day conditional upon
participation, and cessation, but not smoking initiation because most individuals who are
smokers start smoking by age 21 (DeCicca, Kenkel, and Mathios 2008). Moreover, since
additional benefit programs exist for retirees, and their health incentives and behaviors may

Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 12

differ from younger persons, we restrict the sample to those individuals less than 60 years of
age.
Table 1 shows the trends over our study period for our dependent variables smoking
participation, daily cigarette consumption, and cessation using the weighted sample. The first
variable, smoker, indicates whether or not any individual sampled ever smoked in the given
year. This includes casual and infrequent smokers, as well as daily smokers. Over our study
period, the probability that anyone smoked in a given year ranges between 26.8 and 33.1
percent. Limiting the sample to only those who smoked in a given year, the average number
of cigarettes smoked decreased steadily from over 16 cigarettes per day in 1993 to just over
13 cigarettes per day in 2007. The probability that a daily smoker quit ranged from about 6.5
to 9.5 percent a year. There is a spike in the cessation rate in 1999, which we speculate might
be related to the nicotine patch becoming available over-the-counter (Avery et al. 2007), or
the anti-smoking publicity and price hike associated with the 1998 Master Settlement
Agreement between the tobacco industry and the states.9
Table 2 displays the sample-weighted descriptive statistics for the control variables
used in the analysis, which account for race, gender, age, marital status, education, and the
number of young children in the household. In addition to showing the demographics for the
individuals in the dataset as a whole, we disaggregate the data by income group—the lowest
tercile, the middle tercile, and those with incomes in the top tercile of the income distribution
within our sample—in order to observe the differences in what we call “low," “middle," and
“high" income.10 We see that within the sample, higher income individuals are less likely to
have a female head of household and less likely be a minority household than lower income
households. At the same time, these higher income households are more educated and more
likely to have a married head of the household. There are no systematic differences by
whether or not a household has a child under age six, though we do see that the higher

Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 13

income group is less likely to have multiple children under age six. On average, the highest
income tercile receives the highest amount of EITC benefits.11 This distribution of likely
EITC eligibility in our sample suggests that those affected by our IV are likely to fall into the
phase-in region of the EITC, where higher benefits result in increased labor force
participation and additional hours worked amongst eligible individuals. We provide further
analysis of the labor supply response to changes in the maximum EITC benefits within our
sample below.
In Table 3, we present the averages of the dependent variables based on these three
income groups.12 Amongst the low-income families that comprise our sample, those with the
lowest income have the highest probability of smoking and the lowest probability of cessation
when compared to the other two income groups. Table 3 thus shows that the correlation
between income and cessation is positive even when restricting the sample to those with
income below $45,000 per year. However, we do see that the higher income groups have a
higher average daily consumption of cigarettes.
IV. Methods
As discussed above, the relationship between income and smoking may be
endogenous. In order to identify the causal effect of income on smoking, we implement an
instrumental variable identification strategy. Specifically, we estimate an equation of the
form:
(1)
where

,
is a dependent variable that explains individual smoking decisions.

contains

observable individual, state, and time covariates such as socioeconomic status, ethnicity,
marital status, education, and other important demographics. In our baseline OLS models, we
use

to capture the family income of individual i at time t, indexed to 1997 dollars. We

take the log of income to address the skewness. To address the endogeneity of income and

Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 14

smoking we use the maximum EITC benefit amount as an instrument in the first stage of our
two-staged least squares specification. Equation 1 also contains the real price of cigarettes in
each state and year,
fixed effects,

. In addition, we include a linear time trend, as well as state level

, to capture any time invariant state level unobservables that may affect

income and smoking behavior simultaneously. We are careful to again weight all of our
observations in order to provide estimates that are nationally representative and account for
the complex survey design of the CPS.13
While unobserved state-level characteristics may influence smoking behavior, these
characteristics may not be correlated with individual-level income. These state-level
unobservables are even less likely to drive the variation in individual level income created by
cross-state and cross-year variation in the EITC. We therefore provide estimates where we
remove the state fixed effects and instead include the measure of state anti-smoking sentiment
from DeCicca et al (2008) to control for state-level variation in public attitudes about
smoking, where this variable varies across states and within a state over time. By removing
the state fixed effects we are able to exploit the cross-state variation in the maximum value of
EITC benefits rather than simply relying on within-state variation in maximum EITC
benefits.
We focus on three different dependent variables to characterize smoking behavior:
whether or not an individual has smoked in the last year, cessation, and average daily
consumption of cigarettes. Smoking participation and cessation are both binary variables.
Cessation is conditional on the individual being a daily smoker in the last year. The number
of cigarettes is treated as a continuous variable, as it ranges from one to 99 per day, with a
mean of 16.5 cigarettes (a little less than a pack a day) for smokers. When using the number
of cigarettes as a dependent variable, we limit the sample to smokers, and we take the natural
log of this variable in our analysis. Given the inclusion of state and year fixed effects in most

Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 15

of our models, as well as the continuous nature of our dependent variable in the first stage of
our IV model, we estimate Equation (1) as a Linear Probability Model (LPM) for ease of
calculation and interpretation (Angrist and Pischke 2008).14,15 While the elasticity is easily
defined for the log-log specification regarding the number of cigarettes, we calculate the
income elasticity for the remaining specifications as ɛ

= ̅ , where ̅ is alternatively the

average rate of smoking in the sample and the average cessation rate.16
V. Results
As a baseline, we first estimate the standard naïve OLS specification for the effect of
family income on smoking, where income is assumed to be econometrically exogenous.17
The models include controls for minority, age, gender, education (high school graduate or
attended college at some point, or no high school degree), marital status, and number of
children under six, as well as a linear time trend. Table 4 reports the coefficient estimates
from the standard OLS specification with state fixed effects in Columns (1) through (3) and
without state fixed effects, but controlling for the state anti-smoking sentiment (SASS) in
Columns (4) through (6). The second last row of Table 4 shows the income elasticity
calculated from the coefficient on family income. The three columns for each of the two
groups in Table 4 correspond to the dependent variables: current smoking status; the log of
the number of cigarettes smoked per day conditional on being a smoker; and smoking
cessation, conditional on smoking the previous year.
The coefficient estimate on income presented in Column (1) indicates that increases in
an individual's income are associated with a decreased probability of being a smoker. If we
naïvely interpret this as a causal income elasticity, as shown at the bottom of Column (1), we
obtain an income elasticity estimate of -0.078 for being a smoker, significant at the 1 percent
level. The estimated income elasticity of the number of cigarettes smoked per day
conditional on being a smoker is extremely small and statistically indistinguishable from

Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 16

zero. The total elasticity of the demand for cigarettes with respect to income is the sum of the
participation elasticity from Column (1) and the conditional demand elasticity from Column
(2), which in this case is effectively just the participation elasticity of -0.078. In Column (3),
the positive coefficient indicates that the income elasticity of smoking cessation is positive,
meaning that an increase in income is associated with an increase the probability that an
individual will quit smoking. The estimated income elasticity of cessation is 0.051,
significant at the 1 percent level.
Next, in Columns (4) through (6) of Table 4 we present the estimates where we drop
the state fixed effects and instead include the DeCicca et al (2008) measure of state
anti-smoking sentiment.18 The coefficient estimates on income for each specification are
very similar to those estimated with fixed effects, and the statistical significance remains
consistent as well. In Column (4) income elasticity for being a smoker is -0.079, significant
at the 1 percent level. The estimated income elasticity of the number of cigarettes smoked
per day conditional on being a smoker presented in Column (5) is again statistically
indistinguishable from zero, but has increased in magnitude ten times to 0.001. Lastly, in
Column (6), the estimate for the income elasticity of smoking cessation is effectively
identical to that found in Column (3).19 Although not the focus of this paper, broadly in line
with previous estimates, we also find that higher prices reduce smoking participation and
increase smoking cessation.
Our baseline results are broadly in line with previous estimates suggesting that
smoking is an inferior good in the U.S. over our sample time period. For example, Colman
and Remler (2008) estimate that the elasticity of smoking participation with respect to income
is -0.18 and the conditional elasticity is -0.02, for a total elasticity of -0.2.20
In our preferred specification, we treat income as an endogenous determinant of
smoking. We instrument for income using the maximum value of federal and state EITC

Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 17

benefits. Before turning to our new estimates of the causal income elasticity, it is important to
consider evidence on the strength and validity of our IV. In Table 5, we report the first-stage
results and all the F-statistics. The samples differ across the various first-stage estimates,
corresponding to the different dependent variables used in the second stage. The F-statistics
in the first stage of the IV exceed the Stock and Yogo (2002) 10 percent critical value in
Columns (1), (2), (4), and (5). In the sample restricted to individuals who self-identified as
smokers in the last year, the F-statistics are somewhat lower, closer to 8.4. A standard rule of
thumb for detecting weak IVs is that the first-stage F-statistic should exceed 10. Given
evidence of a border-line weak IV in some specifications, we choose a just-identified
specification as an approach to address any potential weak IV problem. This choice is
consistent with Angrist and Pischke’s recommendation: "Just-identified IV is median
unbiased and therefore unlikely subject to a weak instruments critique" (Angrist and Pischke
2008). The sign of the coefficient on the IV is in the expected positive direction and suggests
that a higher EITC tends to increase family income. The magnitude of the EITC effect on
income is small. This is not unexpected, because the EITC effect on income is through labor
supply. 21
To further corroborate the validity of our first-stage results, we estimate an auxiliary
regression of the effect of our IV on labor force participation. This allows us to test whether
we see the same extensive margin response to changes in the state and federal maximum
EITC as found in previous literature. The results presented in Table 6 show that with both
state fixed effects (exploiting within state, cross-year variation) and without state fixed effects
(exploiting cross-state and cross-year variation), an increase in the maximum EITC benefit
amount increases an individual’s probability of labor force participation. We expect that
some of our identification will come from individuals who work more hours in response to

Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 18

changes in the EITC schedule, but the majority of the first stage identification will come from
an extensive margin response to the EITC.
We note that our specification assumes that labor force participation only affects
cigarette demand through its effect on income. That is, using the EITC as an IV we are
unable to separately identify an income effect versus a labor force participation effect on
cigarette demand. Our results could therefore be interpreted as an estimate of the
combination of the income effect and the labor force participation effect, to the extent that
labor force participation affects cigarette demand. Labor force participation might have an
independent effect on cigarette demand if, for example, it exposes the smoker to a worksite
smoking ban or otherwise limits their ability to smoke, and the reduction in smoking during
work is not offset by an increase in smoking when not at work. Although the main goal of a
worksite smoking ban is to reduce secondhand smoke, some studies suggest that they also
reduce cigarette demand (Evans, Farrelly, and Montgomery 1999). Thus our IV estimate
might somewhat understate the income elasticity of demand for cigarettes if increased labor
supply reduces cigarette consumption.
Table 7 presents the second stage IV estimates of the impact of income on smoking.
In sharp contrast with the OLS results in Table 4, the IV estimates imply that smoking is a
normal good. In Column (1) additional income is estimated to increase the probability of
being a smoker, with an income elasticity of 3.58, significant at the 1 percent level. In
Column (2), income also has a positive effect on the log number of cigarettes smoked daily
and is now significant at the 1 percent level. The total elasticity of demand with respect to
income (the sum of the participation elasticity and the conditional demand elasticity) is now
estimated to be 5.62, so in standard terminology smoking is not only a normal good but is
also a luxury good, at least in our low-income sample. Consistent with smoking being a

Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 19

normal good, in Column (3) we estimate that the income elasticity of smoking cessation is
negative and statistically significant.
We again estimate the IV without state fixed effects and controlling for the SASS.
These results are presented in Columns (4) through (6) of Table 7. Each of these estimates
and their statistical significance are similar to those found when state fixed effects are
included. In Column (4) we estimate the income elasticity of being a smoker to be 3.80,
significant at the 1 percent level. In Column (5), we again find that income has a positive
effect on the number of cigarettes consumed; although the estimated elasticity is somewhat
smaller at 1.90, statistically significant at the 1 percent level. The total elasticity of demand
with respect to income is 5.70, which is extremely close to the 5.62 found in the fixed effects
specification. Lastly, in Column (6) we again find that the income elasticity of smoking
cessation is negative and similar in magnitude and statistical significance to Column (3).
To judge the plausibility of the elasticity of demand for cigarettes generated from our
IV estimates we calculate the implied marginal propensity to consume (MPC) from an
additional dollar of income. The average smoker in our sample has a family income of
$22,532.87 in 1997 dollars and consumes 16.5 cigarettes per day at a cost of $0.113 per
cigarette. This yields total annual expenditures on cigarettes of $680.54, or 3.02 percent of
family income. Using a conditional demand elasticity of 2.041 from our model with state
fixed effects, the higher of our elasticity estimates, a 10 percent increase in income
($2,253.29) would yield a 20.41 percent increase in cigarette consumption amongst smokers,
or 3.37 additional cigarettes per day. The average smoker would then spend $139.00 more
per year on cigarettes (3.37*$0.113*365) out of their additional $2,253.29 in income for a
MPC of 0.061, or six cents per additional dollar of income. We believe that a smoker
spending six cents of any additional dollar earned on cigarettes is a perfectly reasonable

Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 20

estimate, particularly given that smoking consumes three percent of the average smoker’s
family income.
There is a significant body of literature demonstrating that education is endogenous
with respect to smoking intensity (Bratti and Miranda 2010) and smoking status (Kenkel,
Lillard, and Mathios 2006; de Walque 2007; Tenn, Herman, and Wendling 2010). While
simultaneously addressing the endogeneity of both income and education to smoking
behavior is beyond the scope of this paper, we are sensitive to the possibility that there may
be some interaction between the unobserved correlates of income, educational attainment,
and smoking behaviors. While we see no reason why the potential endogeneity of education
would bias the estimates from our IV specification, we none the less re-estimate our models
on a sample restricted to the educationally homogenous group of individuals who are high
school graduates only. Doing so, we find results highly comparable to those found for the
full sample, with our IV coefficients on income not statistically different at the 5 percent
level. The one exception occurs with the average daily consumption dependent variable,
where we no longer find a statistically significant effect, and the magnitude of the income
elasticity (0.47) is smaller than that of the full sample (2.1). We attribute this difference to a
heterogeneous treatment effect for this homogenous sample, as well as a lack of power
resulting from cutting the sample in half. These results are available upon request.
Across our various specifications, the differences between the OLS and IV results are
in the expected direction and suggest that the OLS estimates are biased downward by
unobservable heterogeneity associated with higher incomes. As in the income-health and
schooling-health gradients, the bias might reflect systematic differences in time- and
risk-preferences, differences in social networks or other factors.

Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 21

VI. Conclusions
In this paper we examine the relationship between income and smoking, focusing on
the potential endogeneity of income. While our baseline OLS results are consistent with
previous estimates that smoking is now an inferior good in the U.S., our IV results imply that
smoking is a normal or even a luxury good. Our results are partly consistent with Ruhm
(2005), who finds that smoking declines during temporary economic downturns and increases
during economic expansions. However, Ruhm suggests that that this might mainly reflect
changes in non-market time available for healthy lifestyle investments. Although virtually
any IV can be criticized, we believe that our IV based on the EITC is plausibly exogenous,
and our first-stage results show no signs of a weak IV problem for the full sample. We also
note that the difference between the OLS and IV results is in the direction predicted ex ante,
and is similar to biases discussed in research on the income-health and schooling-health
gradients. These lines of argument suggest that our results should be viewed as credible
evidence that for the low-income population we study, smoking is still a normal good.
One implication of our results is that increasing the income of low-income families
through government transfers may have the unintended health consequence of increasing
smoking and decreasing smoking cessation. Because recipients can spend cash transfers as
they like, by their nature such transfers are prone to such unintended consequences. For
example, Dobkin and Puller (2007) find that recipients of Supplemental Security Income
increase their consumption of illegal drugs when their checks arrive at the beginning of the
month, leading to increases in drug-related hospitalizations and deaths. On the other hand,
several recent studies estimate that the EITC expansions reduced maternal smoking and thus
improved infant health (Averett and Wang forthcoming; Cowan and Tefft 2012; Hoynes,
Miller, and Simon 2012). Because we study all low-income individuals and not just mothers,
our results are not necessarily consistent with these estimates; future work could explore the

Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 22

differences in more depth. Hoynes, Miller, and Simon (2012) stress that health improvements
and related external benefits should be taken into account when discussing the value of
anti-poverty programs that make up the safety net. By the same token, a complete policy
analysis of the safety net should also account for the health losses and related social costs that
could result from possible increases in smoking. In light of the unintended health
consequences, it might also make sense to couple anti-poverty programs with anti-smoking
programs targeted at low-income populations. Our results provide a cautionary tale that at
least in some circumstances, reducing socioeconomic disparities via income transfers might
not go hand-in-hand with reducing health disparities.

Notes: p < 0.10,
p < 0.05,
p < 0.01 Columns (1)-(2) include state level fixed
effects. Cigarette Price is average state level price per cigarette in 1997 $s. Smoker is
whether or not you smoked ever in the last year. Cessation is 1 if a smoker in the
previous year quit in the current year.

1. The 89 page chapter on the economics of smoking in the Handbook of Health Economics
provides a 3-sentence discussion of income-elasticity estimates (Chaloupka and Warner

Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 43

2000), compared to a 19-page section on the role of price (pp. 1546 – 1565). Recent studies
of the regressivity of cigarette taxes include Colman and Remler (2008) and Gospodinov and
Irvine (2009).
2. Author calculations using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2010
data.
3. Under the medical sociology theory that social conditions are the fundamental cause of
disease, risk- and time-preference might be viewed as factors that mediate the link between
lack of resources and unhealthy behaviors.
4. All figures used in our analysis are adjusted to 1997 constant dollars.
5. Values are 2011 nominal dollars.
6. See Eissa and Hoynes (2006) for a summary of findings on changes in hours worked in
response to the EITC and a detailed discussion of possible explanations for the limited change
along the intensive margin.
7. These data can be downloaded at: http://www.ukcpr.org/AvailableData.aspx.
8. We account for inflation and index all estimates to 1997 dollars for our analysis.
9. Levy and Meara (2006) find that the Master Settlement Agreement had a relatively small
effect on smoking; although their results are specific to women smoking during pregnancy.
10. In the CPS-ASEC, the specific question regarding income is: “How much did (name/you)
earn from employment before taxes and other deductions (last calendar year)?” This is
intended to be pre- tax/transfer income and should NOT include the EITC payments received.
11. The EITC variable is measured by our IV, which represents the maximum of state/federal
EITC credit for the number of children in the household in the given state of residence.
12. We again provide these descriptive statistics using sample weights.
13. Our results are robust to not using the sample weights both qualitatively and in terms of
statistical significance.

14. The qualitative results and statistical significance are robust to using an instrumental
variable probit specification instead of the linear probability model with our two dependent
binary variables. These are included in the Appendix. Since the daily consumption dependent
variable is approximately normally distributed, we only run a least squares specification for
this variable.
15. We find that in all specifications, nearly every within sample prediction from the linear
probability models fall between 0 and 1, validating the model selection.
16. The calculation is as follows:

17. We additionally estimate logit and probit specifications for our two dependent binary
variables to ensure that the functional form is not driving the results. The marginal effects
and statistical significance are substantively similar in these specifications. The logit results
comparable to the OLS specification, and the results from an IV probit comparable to the
2SLS specification are included in the Appendix.
18. Our results remain consistent if we exclude both the SASS variable and state fixed effects.
These are available upon request.
19. DeCicca, Kenkel and Mathios (2008) discuss the relationship between the elasticity of
smoking participation and the elasticities of cessation and initiation.
20. The Colman and Remler (2008) estimate is derived from a sample covering the full range
of income as opposed to just those earning less than $45,000 per year as done here. Our
somewhat smaller baseline elasticity of -0.078 may suggest that the income-smoking gradient
is stronger at high incomes, so in our sample with a more restricted range of incomes the
average association with income is weaker.

21. Our measure of family income is pre-tax and thus should not directly include the dollar
value of the EITC.
