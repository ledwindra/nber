    "abstract": "\n\nThe following arguments are developed: (i) models without monetary aggregates do not imply that inflation is a non-monetary phenomenon and are not necessarily non-monetary models; (ii) theoretical considerations suggest that such models are misspecified, but the quantitative significance of this misspecification is very small; (iii) some prominent arguments based on  indeterminacy' findings are of dubious merit: there are reasons for believing that findings of solution multiplicity are theoretical curiosities that have no real world significance; (iv) monetary policy rules that violate the Taylor principle, by contrast, possess another characteristic the absence of E-stability that suggests undesirable behavior in practice.\n\n",
