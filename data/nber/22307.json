    "abstract": "\n\nHave bank regulatory policies and unconventional monetary policies\u2014and any possible interactions\u2014been a factor behind the recent \u201cdeglobalisation\u201d in cross-border bank lending? To test this hypothesis, we use bank-level data from the UK\u2014a country at the heart of the global financial system. Our results suggest that increases in microprudential capital requirements tend to reduce international bank lending and some forms of unconventional monetary policy can amplify this effect. Specifically, the UK\u2019s Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) significantly amplified the effects of increased capital requirements on cross-border lending. Quantitative easing did not appear to have a similar effect. We find that this interaction between microprudential regulations and the FLS can explain roughly 30% of the contraction in aggregate UK cross-border bank lending between mid-2012 and end-2013, corresponding to around 10% of the global contraction in cross-border lending. This suggests that unconventional monetary policy designed to support domestic lending can have the unintended consequence of reducing foreign lending.\n\n",
