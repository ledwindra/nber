ABSTRACT
We propose two distinct approaches to the measurement of industry upstreamness (or average distance
from final use) and show that they yield an equivalent measure. Furthermore, we provide two additional
interpretations of this measure, one of them related to the concept of forward linkages in Input-Output
analysis. On the empirical side, we construct this measure for 426 industries using the 2002 US Input-Output
Tables. We also verify the stability of upstreamness across countries in the OECD STAN database,
albeit with a more aggregated industry classification. Finally, we present an application that explores
the determinants of the average upstreamness of exports at the country level using trade flows for 2002.

Introduction

The fragmentation of production across national boundaries has been a distinctive feature
of the world economy in recent decades. Production now often entails the sourcing of inputs and components from multiple suppliers based in several countries. These trends are
likely to leave their imprint on international trade patterns: For example, are countries now
specializing in particular stages of global production processes, or to borrow from Krugman
(1995), speci…c slices of the value chain?
Addressing this question requires …rst and foremost an industry measure of relative production line position. In this article, we present two approaches to building a measure of
industry “upstreamness”(or average distance from …nal use). The two approaches are motivated in distinct ways, but we prove that they yield an equivalent measure. Furthermore, we
provide two additional economic interpretations of this measure, one of them closely related
to the concept of forward linkages in Input-Output (I-O) analysis.
On the empirical side, we construct this measure using the 2002 US I-O Tables as a
benchmark. The high level of disaggregation in the US Tables allows us to calculate upstreamness for a total of 426 industries. We separately construct our measure using the I-O
Tables for selected OECD member countries from the STAN Database, in order to verify
that upstreamness is a stable attribute of industries across di¤erent countries (with some
caveats, see details in Section 4).
Finally, we present an application of our measure, by characterizing the average upstreamness of exports at the country level using trade ‡ows in the year 2002. We also report here
some regression-based …ndings which describe how upstreamness a¤ects the cross-country,
cross-industry pattern of trade. Our initial exploration indicates that stronger country institutions pertaining to the rule of law and …nancial development are correlated with a
propensity to export in relatively more downstream industries. Our results also suggest a
role of relative factor endowments in shaping the degree to which a country’s exports appear
to concentrate in relatively upstream versus downstream industries.

Three Measures of Upstreamness

2.1

Closed-Economy Benchmark

To build intuition, we begin by considering an N -industry closed economy with no inventories. In such an economy, for each industry i 2 f1; 2; :::; N g, the value of gross output (Yi )
equals the sum of its use as a …nal good (Fi ) and its use as an intermediate input to other

1

industries (Zi )
Yi = Fi + Zi = Fi +

N
X

(1)

dij Yj

j=1

where, in the last summation, dij is the dollar amount of sector i’s output needed to produce
one dollar worth of industry j’s output. Iterating this identity, we can express industry i’s
output as an in…nite sequence of terms which re‡ect the use of this industry’s output at
di¤erent positions in the value chain, starting with …nal use
Yi = Fi +

j=1 k=1 l=1

Building on this identity, Antràs and Chor (2011) suggest computing the (weighted)
average position of an industry’s output in the value chain, by multiplying each of the terms
in (2) by their distance from …nal use plus one and dividing by Yi , or
U1i

(3)

It is clear that U1i 1 and that larger values are associated with relatively higher levels of
upstreamness of industry i’s output. Although computing (3) might appear to require comP
puting an in…nite power series, provided that N
i=1 dij < 1 for all j (a natural assumption),
the numerator of the above measure equals the i-th element of the N 1 matrix [I D] 2 F ,
where D is an N N matrix whose (i; j)-th element is dij and F is a column matrix with
Fi in row i.1 Using the fact that Y = [I D] 1 F , which is easily veri…ed from (1), the
numerator can also be shown to equal the i-th element of the N 1 matrix [I D] 1 Y ,
where Y is a column matrix with Yi in row i.
Fally (2011) instead proposes a measure of upstreamness (or distance from …nal-good production) based on the notion that industries selling a disproportionate share of their output
to relatively upstream industries should be relatively upstream themselves.2 In particular,
he posits the following linear system of equations that implicitly de…nes upstreamness U2 for
1

To be more speci…c, from the Perron-Frobenius theorems for non-negative matrices, the maximal
PN eigenvalue of D is bounded above by the largest column sum of D, which is less than one whenever i=1 dij < 1
1
for all j. But if every eigenvalue of D is less than one in absolute value, then [I D] must exist.
2
It should be noted that despite the order in which we introduce these measures, Fally (2011)’s measure
chronologically precedes the one in Antràs and Chor (2011). Fally (2011) also proposes a measure of the
number of stages embodied in an industry’s output.

each industry i
U2i = 1 +

N
X
dij Yj

Yi

j=1

U2j ,

(4)

where note that dij Yj =Yi is the share of sector i’s total output that is purchased by industry
j. Again it is clear that U2i
1, and using matrix algebra, we can express this measure
1
compactly as U2 = [I
] 1, where is the matrix with dij Yj =Yi in entry (i; j) and 1 is
a column vector of ones.
These two measures of upstreamness might appear distinct, but simple manipulations
demonstrate that they are in fact equivalent (see the Appendix), which leads us to
Proposition 1 U1i = U2i = Ui for all i 2 f1; 2; :::; N g.
A limitation of these two measures is that they impose an ad hoc cardinality in the sense
that the distance between any two stages of production is set to one. In the Appendix we
show, however, that these measures can in fact be given two precise economic interpretations.
First, holding constant the …nal-use vector F and the o¤-diagonal elements of the matrix D,
we show that
N
1 X @Yi
;
(5)
Ui =
Yi j=1 @djj
so Ui equals the semi-elasticity of an industry’s output to a uniform change in input-output
linkages within industries. Intuitively, when the extent to which industries’reliance on inputs
from their own sector increases, this will tend to increase output in all industries, but one
would expect the e¤ect to be disproportionately larger in upstream industries via a multiplier
e¤ect.
Before providing a second economic interpretation of the upstreamness measure Ui , it is
useful to note that in a closed economy with no inventories, the dollar value of gross output
(Yi ) in each industry i 2 f1; 2; :::; N g will also equal the sum of this industry’s value added
(or cost of primary factors, including pro…ts), Vi , and its purchases of intermediate inputs
from other industries, or using our notation above,
Yi = Vi +

N
X

dji Yi .

(6)

j=1

In the Appendix, we show then that, holding constant the allocation matrix
Ui =

N
X
@Yj
j=1

3

@Vi

:

, we have that
(7)

Thus, Ui also turns out to equal the dollar amount by which output of all sectors increases
following a one dollar increase in value added in sector i. Readers familiar with InputOutput analysis will recognize that equation (7) relates the measure of upstreamness Ui with
a standard measure of cost-push e¤ects or total forward linkages in supply-side Input-Output
models (see Miller and Blair, 2009, particularly Chapter 12, for a discussion).3 Again, it is
intuitive that upstream industries will tend to generate more forward linkages in an economy,
and that cost shocks in those industries will also tend to have a particularly magni…ed e¤ect
on prices (and on nominal output). What is more surprising, in our view, is that the measure
of upstreamness independently derived by Antràs and Chor (2011) and Fally (2011) turns
out to exactly equal this widely-known measure of forward linkages.4

2.2

Open-Economy Adjustment

So far we have assumed that the economy is closed to international trade. Since one of our
main goals is to measure the level of upstreamness of a country’s exports, it is important to
extend the measurement of upstreamness to an open-economy environment. Incorporating
this, the identity in (1) is now modi…ed to
Yi = Fi +

N
X

dij Yj + Xi

Mi ;

j=1

where Xi and Mi denote exports and imports of sector i output.
It might appear that as long as net exports Xi Mi are not more or less upstream than
domestic production, allowing for international trade ‡ows would have no bearing on the
measures of upstreamness discussed above. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize that
the interindustry commodity ‡ow data used to construct the matrix of US input-output coef…cients D do not distinguish between ‡ows of domestic goods and international exchanges.5
3

Starting with Ghosh (1958), supply-side I-O analysis takes the allocation matrix
as the primitive of
these models. In this literature, a standard measure of total forward linkages in a given industry is the
1
corresponding row sum of the so-called Ghosh inverse matrix [I
] . Remember, however, that Fally’s
1
upstreamness measure satis…es U2 = [I
] 1, which is precisely the vector of these row sums.
4
Supply-side I-O models have been controversial in the literature because they appear to be based on
assumptions inconsistent with Leontief’s traditional demand-side models. As an example, our derivation of
(7) holds the elements of the matrix constant, but when output levels are endogenous, this can only occur
if the elements of the matrix D (the primitives of demand-side I-O models) adjust to “exogenous”changes in
value added or cost of primary factors. Dietzenbacher (1997) proposed a price interpretation of supply-side
models that reconciled these two approaches and also illustrated the links between forward linkages and
cost-push e¤ects.
5
In other words, the coe¢ cient dij is computed as the total purchases by industry j of industry i’s output,
regardless of whether those purchases are domestic or involve imports. See Horowitz and Planting (2009) for
more discussion, speci…cally the description of the Import Matrix in the I-O Tables. The OECD STAN data

4

Hence, although the share of a country’s gross output in industry i that is used as intermediate inputs in industry j (at home or abroad) is given by the ratio
ij

=

dij Yj + Xij
Yi

Mij

,

(8)

in practice we lack information on international interindustry ‡ows Xij and Mij .
It seems sensible, however, to assume
Assumption 1:

ij

= Xij =Xi = Mij =Mi .

In words, Assumption 1 imposes that the share of a country’s industry i output used in
industry j (at home or abroad), i.e., ij in (8), is identical to the share of industry i’s exports
(imports) that are used by industry j producers. With this assumption, one can easily verify
that our two measures of upstreamness in (3) and (4) continue to coincide after replacing dij
with
Yi
.
(9)
d^ij = dij
Yi Xi + Mi
Incidentally, the denominator in (9) is precisely the domestic absorption of industry i’s
output. It is important to emphasize that although Assumption 1 imposes a certain structure
on cross-country variation in production patterns, it is perfectly consistent with countries
specializing in di¤erent segments of the value chain. We next illustrate this with a simple
example that also highlights the importance of the adjustment in (9).
Example. Suppose that there are two industries, 1 and 2, and two countries, Home and
Foreign. Industry 2 produces only intermediate inputs which are entirely sold to producers
in sector 1, while sector 1 produces only …nal goods. Clearly, our closed-economy measure
would suggest upstreamness values of 1 and 2 for industries 1 and 2, respectively. Suppose,
however, that Home exports part of its production of good 1 to …nal consumers in Foreign,
while Foreign producers of good 2 sell part of their output to Home producers in sector 1.
Hence, relative to Foreign, Home appears to specialize in the relatively downstream sector.
It is straightforward to verify (see the Appendix) that our adjusted measure delivers the
correct values of upstreamness in each industry and each country (that is, 1 and 2), while,
without the adjustment, the measure of upstreamness in industry 2 would be biased upwards
at Home and biased downwards in Foreign, with the size of the bias increasing in the value
of Foreign exports to Home.
The above discussion abstracts from changes in inventories for ease of notation. A similar
set of considerations is involved with inventories, as the input-output matrix D does not
described below do have separate information available on import and domestic ‡ows, but this information
is often imputed under an assumption of proportional use of domestic and imported components.

5

separately identify inputs obtained from a draw-down of inventories as opposed to from
fresh production. It is nevertheless straightforward to show that if we adopt a condition
analogous to Assumption 1 in the treatment of inventories, then (9) is valid so long as Yi in
the denominator is calculated subtracting the value of any net change in inventories of i (see
Appendix for details). This is in fact what we do in our empirical implementation below.

3

Upstreamness in US Production

We construct the above measure of industry upstreamness using the 2002 US benchmark
Input-Output (I-O) Tables, as made available by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)
on their website. A key advantage of the US data is that it reports information on production
linkages between industries at a highly disaggregated level, namely at the level of six-digit
I-O industry codes. There are altogether 426 industries in the I-O Tables, of which 279 are
in manufacturing.
For our purposes, we use the detailed Supplementary Use Table after rede…nitions. The
(i; j)-th entry of this Use Table reports the value of inputs of commodity i used in the
production of industry j in the US economy. An additional set of columns also records
the value of commodity i that enters into …nal uses, namely consumption, investment, net
changes in inventories, and net exports.6
We construct the square matrix with the open-economy adjustment in (9) as follows.
The numerator of the (i; j)-th entry of , dij Yj , is precisely the value of commodity i used in
j’s production; we therefore plug in the (i; j)-th entry from the Use Table for this numerator.
The denominator Yi Xi + Mi is in turn calculated as the sum of values in row i of the Use
Table, less that recorded under net exports and net changes in inventories. With this ,
the formula [I
] 1 1 then delivers a column vector whose i-th entry is the upstreamness
measure for industry i, as shown in Section 2.
The values we obtain reveal that industries vary considerably in terms of their average
production line position. The measure of upstreamness ranges from a minimum of 1 (19
industries in which all output goes only to …nal uses) to a maximum of 4.65 (Petrochemicals).
Its mean value across the 426 industries is 2.09, with a standard deviation of 0.85.7 The
average industry therefore enters into use in production processes roughly one stage before
…nal consumption or investment. For illustrative purposes, Table 1 lists the 20 least and
most upstream manufacturing industries. Of note, automobiles, furniture and footwear are
6

The Use Table reports a further breakdown of the …nal use value of consumption and investment into
private and government purchases. We will however not be using this breakdown in our analysis.

These summary statistics are similar when restricting to manufacturing industries only.

among the most downstream of industries, with almost all of their output going directly to
the end-user. On the other hand, the most upstream industries tend to be involved in the
processing of raw materials.8
A natural question to ask is how upstreamness correlates with other industry characteristics, particularly factor intensities. We construct measures of the latter using the most
recent version of the NBER-CES Manufacturing Database (Bartelsman et al. 2009). Table 2
reports the correlations between our industry upstreamness variable and several alternative
measures that have been commonly used to capture skill- and capital-intensity. Speci…cally,
we take the average annual value between 1996-2005 for each of these industry variables
as calculated from the NBER-CES Database.9 Note however that given the nature of the
NBER-CES Database, we are able to construct these variables only for the manufacturing
sector, so the correlations are based only on the subset of 279 manufacturing industries.
From Table 2, we …nd that upstreamness is associated with greater physical capitalintensity, with this correlation being highly signi…cantly regardless of how capital-intensity
is calculated, namely log(Capital stock per worker), log(Capital expenditures over payroll),
8

For the 426 industries, the correlation between upstreamness calculated with the open-economy and
inventories corrections and upstreamness calculated without these corrections is a relatively high 0.89.
9
Although the NBER-CES Database provides information for NAICS industries, these are very similar
to the 2002 I-O codes. We applied the straightforward mapping between the two classi…cation systems
available on the BEA website. Note also that the NAICS system came into use in 1997, so this raises some
concerns over concordance accuracy for pre-1997 data. It turns out however that the correlation between
the 1996-2005 and 1997-2005 average values for each of these industry variables is very high (in excess of
0.99), so that it makes little di¤erence if we drop the 1996 data.

or log(Capital stock over payroll). On the other hand, upstreamness is negatively correlated
with skill-intensity, but more weakly so: The correlation is only signi…cant when using the
non-production worker share of total payroll to measure skill-intensity, and not signi…cant
when using the log of the non-production worker share of total employment.10

Upstreamness in Other Countries

The upstreamness measure is most likely to be useful if its ranking is stable across countries.
In practice, stability is somewhat di¢ cult to verify because national I-O tables di¤er in their
product/industry classi…cations and the level of aggregation employed. Fortunately, there
have been some e¤orts to collect and produce I-O tables that are consistent across countries.
The OECD STAN database contains easily accessible I-O tables for many countries in a
reasonably well-concorded fashion. A subset of the STAN tables were submitted by Eurostat,
the statistics o¢ ce of the European Union. We employ the STAN data for a subset of 16
EU countries that share an exact aggregation of the data for 2005.11 These Eurostat tables
contain 41 sectors, 13 of which are in manufacturing. As the rest of our paper relies on
US data, we also check whether upstreamness calculated from the US table in the STAN
database is highly correlated with the European measures. Bear in mind however that
di¤erent national industry de…nitions mean that the US data is aggregated di¤erently in the
STAN database than in the European data we employ. In particular, three industries that
are reported for the European countries are not reported for the US.
We calculate the upstreamness measure for each individual country, following the methodology described in Section 3. To verify the consistency of industry upstreamness across countries, we conduct a Spearman rank correlation test among all country pairs in the sample.
These results are reported in Table 3. The rank correlation is always large and positive; in
all country pairs, this is signi…cantly di¤erent from zero at a p-value of 0.01. In particular,
the US measures yield industry rankings that are consistent with those from the European
data. A useful point to note is that the correlations tend to be slightly lower for small
countries where trade features as a large percentage of output, since in such countries, the
open-economy adjustment would matter more. Luxembourg is a clear outlier in this regard,
in that the correction for trade generates an upward shift in its measures of upstreamness
relative to what is observed in less trade-dependent countries.12

See Fally (2011) for correlations with other industry variables widely used in empirical work.
The included countries are: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany,
Greece, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain.
12
For example, Luxembourg’s Finance & Insurance sector has an upstreamness measure of 22.28. Only
Luxembourg has outliers so large that they a¤ect measures of central tendency across the European sample.

Notes: Sample includes countries in the OECD-STAN database with industry classi…cations that are imperfectly concorded with those in Table 3. All Spearman rank correlations are signi…cantly di¤erent from zero
at the 1% level, except USA-CHN, which is signi…cant at the 5% level.

We also check the joint correlation of upstreamness across all 16 European countries
through a principal component analysis, and …nd that 76 percent of the total variation in
the measure is captured by a single component. Thus, not only are the measures correlated
among pairs of countries, the measures are jointly correlated to a very high degree. Moreover,
the correlation of US upstreamness with the principal component of the European measures
is 0.82.
The variation of our upstreamness measure in the European data is also largely consistent with the range of values reported earlier in Table 1. In the European countries other
than Luxembourg, we …nd a mean upstreamness of 2.50, and a standard deviation of 0.84.
The mean upstreamness for industries across European countries ranges from 1.09 (Health
and social work) to 3.92 (Iron and steel). In sum, the European evidence gives us great
con…dence that the industry measures are stable across countries, at least at the higher level
of aggregation reported in the STAN database.
As noted, concordance issues make it di¢ cult to summarize all the relationships among
country measures of upstreamness in the OECD data. Nonetheless, we also conducted
the Spearman rank correlation test against the wider set countries with I-O tables in the
OECD STAN database, even though this typically reduces the number of industries which
we can con…dently match across countries. The countries with available data from the period
2002-2005 include all OECD member states (excluding Switzerland and Iceland), as well as
several large non-member countries (Brazil, China, India, Indonesia and Romania). The
pairwise correlations among all these country measures (including those from the previous
set of countries in Table 3) are positive and statistically signi…cant in the vast majority of
cases. In order to summarize the information succinctly, we report correlations between
the US measure of upstreamness calculated from the OECD STAN data and that for these
additional countries in Table 4. These correlations are all reassuringly high in spite of the

11

above-mentioned concordance issues.13

Application to Trade

We brie‡y explore how our measure of industry upstreamness, speci…cally that based on the
more disaggregate 2002 US I-O Tables, can provide some new perspectives on trade patterns
at the country level. In particular, with this new measure, we are now equipped to describe
a country’s average position in global production chains, namely whether the country tends
on average to be an exporter in relatively upstream versus downstream industries.
Toward this end, we calculate a summary measure of the upstreamness of a country’s
exports as follows. Data on world trade ‡ows at the Harmonized System six-digit (HS6) level
are taken from the BACI dataset.14 BACI draws originally on the UN Comtrade database,
but applies a procedure to harmonize and clean the data to reconcile trade ‡ows reported
by exporting and importing countries. We map the trade ‡ows from HS6 to US I-O 2002
categories using a concordance provided by the BEA. We then take a weighted average
of industry upstreamness values for each country, using the total exports by the country
in the respective industries as weights. Naturally, this assumes that the US measures of
upstreamness provide a good description of production line position in other countries as
well, but as we have seen in Section 3, this appears to be a reasonable starting point.
In what follows, we consider trade ‡ows from 2002 for a core sample of 181 countries.15
Constructing country upstreamness as described above, we obtain a mean value of export
upstreamness of 2.30 with a standard deviation of 0.58. If attention is restricted to manufacturing trade ‡ows, this mean country upstreamness falls to 2.05, with a standard deviation
of 0.49. This drop re‡ects the fact that many primary and resource-extracting industries
tend to enter production processes at relatively upstream stages.16
Looking beyond these broad averages, Table 5 reports the mean values of export upstreamness by country income groups. We split the countries in our sample into quartiles,
as determined by the mean log real GDP per capita between 1996-2005, calculated from the
Penn World Tables, Version 7.0 (Heston et al. 2011). At …rst glance, taking into consider13

All of the upstreamness measures we calculate for country-industry pairs in the OECD database are
available from the authors.

Available at http://www.cepii.fr/anglaisgraph/bdd/baci.htm
15
This consists of the 181 countries for which the export upstreamness measure could be constructed, and
for which data on real GDP per capita for 1996-2005 was available in the Penn World Tables, Version 7.0.
We merged Belgium and Luxembourg as the BACI do not report separate trade ‡ows for the two countries.
16
The mean value of our upstreamness measure for the 30 industries related to agriculture, forestry and
mining (I-O codes starting with ‘1’or ‘21’) is 2.84, compared to the mean upstreamness of 2.10 for the 279
manufacturing industries (I-O codes starting with ‘3’).

Notes: Countries are grouped into income quartiles based on the average log PPP-adjusted GDP per capita
over 1996-2005, from the Penn World Tables, Version 7.0. The average upstreamness of country exports
and its standard deviation within each quartile is reported under the …rst set of columns labeled “All”. The
second set of columns restricts the calculation to manufacturing exports only.

ation all trade ‡ows, the export activities of poorer countries appear to be in slightly more
upstream industries than that of richer countries. However, when we focus in on manufacturing trade ‡ows alone, no simple relationship between country per capita GDP and export
upstreamness is evident. This is not entirely surprising given that we have seen that diverse
manufacturing industries can feature similar values of upstreamness. Recall for instance that
automobiles and footwear both rank among the …ve most downstream industries.
More interestingly, the standard deviation of export upstreamness within each country
quartile decreases as the mean income level rises. Countries in the top quartile are thus more
similar in terms of the average position they occupy in global production lines, while there
is much more variation across poorer countries on this dimension.17 To give an example,
consider Bangladesh and Tajikistan, two countries with a similarly low level of per capita
income. Although both countries are in the bottom income quartile of our sample, they
are at opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of export upstreamness. Bangladesh ranks
among the …ve most downstream countries in terms of its manufacturing exports (country
upstreamness = 1:26), due to its position as a major exporter of apparel, a good that tends
to be sold directly to end-consumers. Tajikistan instead ranks among the …ve most upstream
countries (country upstreamness = 3:53), as processed alumina takes up the lion’s share of
its exports. Once again, there does not appear to be a simple uniform story that connects a
country’s income level to its average production line position.
Building on this discussion, we examine the correlations between export upstreamness
and various country characteristics more systematically in Table 6. We stress that our
objective here is not to establish causality or investigate particular mechanisms, but simply
17

A similar conclusion is reached if we consider the coe¢ cient of variation instead.

13

to uncover interesting patterns that relate to a country’s average production line position.
Panel A in Table 6 reports regression …ndings in which country upstreamness based on all
exports is the dependent variable, while Panel B reports the corresponding …ndings when
upstreamness is calculated for manufacturing exports only. We use explanatory variables
that are from standard sources of cross-country data; where possible, we have calculated
these as averages over 1996-2005.
In Column 1, we verify that the simple bivariate correlation between country upstreamness and log real GDP per capita (from the Penn World Tables) is not statistically signi…cant.
We …nd much more interesting results in Columns 2-4 where we introduce variables related
to country institutions, namely: (i) a rule of law index from Kaufmann et al. (2011), that
is often used as an indicator of the strength of contracting institutions; and (ii) the ratio of
private credit to GDP from Beck et al. (2010), re‡ecting the level of …nancial development
in the economy. The negative partial correlations obtained here imply that better rule of
law and stronger …nancial development are associated at the country level with a basket of
exports that is relatively more downstream in terms of production line position.
Column 5 explores whether factor endowments have a role to play in determining a
country’s export upstreamness. We include a measure of log physical capital per worker,
calculated from the Penn World Tables using the perpetual inventory method in Hall and
Jones (1999), as well as the average years of schooling in the population aged 15 and over
from Barro and Lee (2010). The …ndings here suggest that the negative correlation between
country upstreamness and …nancial development is a particularly robust one; that for country
rule of law in contrast becomes imprecisely estimated in both panels. Moreover, there appears
to be some potential role for factor endowments in explaining a country’s average production
line position, as human capital is associated with more downstream exports. This last …nding
nevertheless needs to be taken with a pinch of salt, as this correlation with years of schooling
is no longer signi…cant in the lower panel that focuses on manufacturing trade ‡ows.18
We have also examined the average upstreamness of imports by country using the same
approach as that taken for exports. First, we …nd that the calculated country import upstreamness variable has a lower mean (2.10 if we consider all commodities and 2.01 for
manufacturing only) and a smaller standard deviation (0.25 for all commodities and 0.22 for
manufacturing only), as compared to export upstreamness. The Pearson correlation between
import and export upstreamness across countries is small and not signi…cant if we consider
all commodities (0.07), but becomes larger and signi…cant at the 1% level if we restrict our
sample to manufacturing industries (0.20). In terms of cross-country regressions (as in Ta18

All our results are similar when controlling for a measure of openness, namely exports plus imports over
GDP, from the Penn World Tables. This variable itself has little explanatory power for export upstreamness.

ble 6), we …nd no signi…cant e¤ect of any of the country variables used above except for
GDP per capita which is associated with a negative coe¢ cient (results available on request).
The relevance of these country variables in explaining trade patterns is thus speci…c to the
supply-side, and does not appear to be driven by di¤erences in the composition of demand.
So far we have focused on studying the e¤ects of country characteristics on the average
upstreamness of their exports. An alternatively, widely-used approach in the literature
consists in exploiting the full cross-country and cross-industry variation in trade ‡ow data
by running speci…cations of the form
log Xci =

c+

i+

X

l

Vc;l

Ui +

l

X

l;m

Vc;l

Si;m + "ci .

l;m

The dependent variable is now the log of exports from country c in industry i in the year 2002
(again from the BACI data source), at the US I-O 2002 industry level. To examine whether
the production line position of an industry in‡uences the cross-country, cross-industry pattern of trade, we include on the right-hand side industry upstreamness, Ui , interacted with a
set of country characteristics, Vc;l , which are indexed by l. The c ’s and i ’s are full sets of
country and industry …xed e¤ects respectively, while "ci is a standard noise term; in practice,
we will report robust standard errors. In some later speci…cations, we will further control for
the interaction between country variables and other industry characteristics, Si;m , indexed by
m, to capture other potential determinants of the pattern of trade that arise from a country’s
ability to facilitate specialization in industries with particular production requirements.
Column 1 of Table 7 reports a baseline speci…cation in which we interact all the country
variables considered previously in Table 6 with industry upstreamness, to explore whether
these help to explain trade patterns. The interaction between country rule of law and
industry upstreamness is highly signi…cant at the 1% level, indicating that countries with
better rule of law tend to export more in industries that are relatively downstream. It does
appear too that there is a similar tendency for countries with better …nancial development
to export more in downstream industries, but this coe¢ cient is not statistically signi…cant.
Exploiting the fact that we now have more data points, Column 2 includes an interaction
between the square of log per capita income and Ui . We do uncover evidence of a non-linear
e¤ect of country income on patterns of trade, with the coe¢ cients suggesting that countries
at very high or very low levels of per capita income would tend to feature more upstream
exports.19 Of note, the e¤ects of country rule of law and …nancial development remain similar
in this speci…cation. Column 2 further reveals that countries that are relatively abundant in

We do not obtain signi…cant results when including the square of log real per capita GDP in the earlier

physical capital tend to be more active in exporting in upstream industries.
In Columns 3 and 4, we re-run these …rst two speci…cations focusing only on trade
‡ows for the manufacturing sector. The results here are very similar, particularly for the
e¤ects of a country’s rule of law and physical capital endowment, in in‡uencing the relative
production line position of its exports. However, the coe¢ cient of the interaction involving
…nancial development is now essentially zero and very imprecisely estimated. In Column 5,
we include further interaction terms between country factor endowments and industry factor
intensities (for both human and physical capital), to control for endowment-based motives
for trade of a Heckscher-Ohlin ‡avor following Romalis (2004). This does not a¤ect our
earlier …ndings regarding how country variables interact with industry upstreamness. (We
have used the log capital stock per worker and log non-production share of total employment
variables in these regressions, but the results are very similar when using the other factor
intensity variables in Table 2.) Lastly, we cluster our standard errors by exporting country
in Column 6, but the correlations we have found continue to remain signi…cant at least at
the 10% level.20
Summarizing our …ndings from Tables 6 and 7, country institutions such as the rule of law
and …nancial development appear to be correlated with the relative production line position
of a country’s exports. There is some evidence too that factor endowments, namely physical
capital and skill abundance, do matter in this regard. We view these …ndings as motivation
for possible future theoretical work to understand how underlying country conditions interact
with production line position in determining patterns of specialization and trade.

Conclusion

We have developed and constructed a measure of industry upstreamness in this short note.
The empirical applications which we presented in Section 5, though preliminary in their
nature, suggest that this is an industry attribute that warrants further attention particularly in this age of cross-border production fragmentation. We have started exploring these
potential research directions ourselves in our separate work. Fally (2011) for example has explored issues related to production line position, its evolution over time, and its implications
for comparative advantage, using more detailed time-series, cross-country, cross-industry
variation in trade ‡ows. Taking contracting issues seriously, Antràs and Chor (2011) seek
to understand how cross-border …rms would seek to organize themselves along production
chains, vis-à-vis the integration versus outsourcing decision.
20

All our results in Table 7 are qualitatively similar if we omit trade ‡ows related to the extraction and
processing of petroleum (results available on request).

Appendix

This Appendix provides the proof of our key result on the equivalence of the two separately-de…ned
measures of industry upstreamness, as well as the proofs of the two additional interpretations.
It further derives the open-economy adjustment, as well as that for the treatment of inventories.
Finally, it provides details on the two-country, two-industry example developed in the text. The
notation follows that in our main text.

Let P be the column vector whose i-th entry is Pi . Also, let D denote the square matrix whose

up the Pi ’s in (11) into column-vector form, we have: P = Y + DP , where Y is the column vector
with Yi as its i-th entry.
Solving for P leads to
P = [I D] 1 Y .

Note also that this derivation emphasizes that our measure of upstreamness is equal to the row
sum of the so-called Ghosh inverse matrix [I
] 1 , which in turn is a standard measure of total
forward linkages in Input-Output models (see Miller and Blair, 2009, p. 558).

A.3

Open-Economy Adjustment

Recall that we calculate our upstreamness measure for all N industries via the formula [I
] 1 1,
with 1 being a column vector of N one’s, and
being the square matrix whose (i; j)-th entry is
dij Yj =Yi in the closed-economy setting. In the open-economy setting, we therefore need to determine
the correction that needs to be applied in order for the entries of the matrix to continue to re‡ect
the share of domestic output from i that is purchased by industry j as inputs, regardless of whether
the purchasing industry is located at home or abroad.
With trade, the basic output identity for each industry i now becomes
Yi = Fi + Zi + Xi
= Fi + X F i

Mi

MF i + Zi + XZi

MZi ,

where Fi and Zi denote the value of output produced domestically in industry i that goes respectively towards …nal uses and intermediate input uses in the home economy. Xi and Mi denote total
exports and imports of industry i. These in turn can be broken down into exports and imports
that go to …nal uses (XF i and MF i respectively), and exports and imports that are used as inputs
in the production of other goods (XZi and MZi ).
Note that
N
X
Zi + XZi MZi =
(dij Yj + Xij Mij ) ,
j=1

where the sum is taken over industries j that purchase inputs of i. Xij and Mij refer respectively to
the exports and imports from industry i that are purchased for intermediate input use speci…cally
in industry j. In the open-economy, let ij denote the share of i’s domestic production that is
purchased directly by industry j (both at home or abroad). ij is thus given by
ij

=

dij Yj + Xij
Yi

22

Mij

,

(13)

This takes into account the fact that in the US I-O Tables, the …nal-use and intermediate-use
values reported do not distinguish between goods/intermediates that are produced domestically
versus that which is imported.21
One problem with taking (13) directly to the data is that Xij and Mij are typically not observed.
To make progress, we argue that it is reasonable to assume that the share of industry i’s output
used in industry j (at home and abroad) be identical to the share of industry i’s exports (imports)
that are used by industry j producers, namely
Xij =

ij Xi

Mij =

ij Mi .

and

This is precisely Assumption 1 in our main paper. Substituting these expressions into (13), straightforward manipulation leads to
dij Yj
.
ij =
Yi Xi + Mi
We therefore implement the open-economy adjustment by replacing dij Yj =Yi with the above
expression for ij for the entries of the matrix . This is equivalent to replacing dij with
d^ij = dij

Yi

Yi
X i + Mi

(14)

as stated in the main paper.

A.4

Treatment of Inventories

There is one remaining item classi…ed under …nal uses in the input-output tables that requires
careful treatment, namely net changes to inventories. We have abstracted from this when discussing
the open-economy adjustment, to avoid cluttering the notation, but it can be readily seen that a
similar set of considerations is involved. The input-output matrix D does not distinguish between
inputs that are obtained from past inventories as opposed to new production. Taking this into
account, the relevant share of i’s domestic production that is purchased directly by industry j
(both at home or abroad) is given more precisely by
inv
ij

=

dij Yj + Xij Mij + Nij
,
Yi

where Nij denotes here the net value of industry i output purchased by industry j for the purposes
of inventorization. (The superscript ‘inv’indicates that this expression for ij explicitly spells out
21

The Bureau of Economic Analysis does provide an accompanying “Import Matrix”with the 2002 Tables
that reports …nal-use and intermediate-use values that come from foreign sources. However, due to the
limited information on the use of imports at the industry level, the “Import Matrix”is actually constructed
based on a proportionality assumption that the share of import use is the same across all …nal uses and
industries. See Horowitz and Planting (2009) for details.

the role of net inventories.) When Nij is positive, this means that industry j is on net increasing
its inventories of input i; a negative Nij in turn indicates a net draw-down of j’s inventories of i.
To take this to the data, we once again face the problem that Nij is not easily observed. We
therefore make the same proportionality assumption as with the open-economy correction
Nij =

inv
ij Ni ,

where Ni is the aggregate net change in inventories of output from industry i. In words, we assume
that the share of industry i’s output that is purchased by industry j is equal to the share of net
changes of inventories of i that can be attributed to the net changes made by industry j.
With this assumption, straightforward algebra yields
inv
ij

=

Yi

dij Yj
X i + Mi

Ni

.

This requires that we correct for net changes of inventories, Ni , in the denominator of inv
ij . Alter^
natively, as stated in the main paper, the expression for dij in (14) is valid so long as the Yi in the
denominator is calculated excluding the value of net changes in inventories of i.

A.5

Details of Two-Country, Two-Industry Example

Towards the end of Section 2.2, we have developed a simple example to illustrate the importance
of the open-economy adjustment. Here, we provide some further details on this example. Because
industry 2 produces only intermediate inputs which are entirely sold to producers in sector 1, while
sector 1 produces only …nal goods, the matrix D is composed of zeros except for the (2; 1)-entry,
i.e., in the second row and …rst column. Remember also that Home exports part of its production
of good 1 to …nal consumers in Foreign, while Foreign producers of good 2 sell part of their output
to Home producers in sector 1. Denote by X1H the volume of Home net exports (or Foreign net
imports) in sector 1, and by X2F the volume of Foreign net exports (or Home net imports) in sector
2. In the data, the (2; 1)-element of the matrix D will be given by
dH
21 =

Y2H + X2F
,
Y1H

at Home, and by
dF21 =

Y2F

X2F
Y1F

in Foreign. These correspond to the dollar amounts of sector 2’s output (domestic or imported)
used to produce one dollar worth of industry 1’s output in each country. In practice, we do not
observe whether Foreign exports entail …nal goods or intermediate inputs, but Assumption 1 would
lead us to correctly categorize all Foreign exports as intermediate inputs.
Let us now compute upstreamness in each industry at Home and in Foreign. Consider …rst
using our formula for U2 in (4) without the open-economy adjustment. Then, at Home, we would

24

compute
U1H

= 1

U2H

= 1 + dH
21

Y1H
Y2H + X2F
=
1
+
> 2;
Y2H
Y2H

while in Foreign we would compute
U1F

= 1

U2F

= 1 + dF21

Y1F
Y F XF
= 1 + 2 F 2 < 2:
F
Y2
Y2

Instead, applying the open-economy adjustment, we would obtain the conceptually right answers:
U1H

= U1F = 1

U2H

= 1 + dH
21

Y1H
Y2H
=2
Y2H + X2F Y2H

U2F

= 1 + dF21

Y2F
Y1F
= 2:
Y2F X2F Y2F

In sum, the adjusted measure delivers the correct values of upstreamness in each industry and
each country, while, without the adjustment, the measure of upstreamness in industry 2 is biased
upwards at Home and biased downwards in Foreign. Furthermore, the size of the bias is increasing
in the value of Foreign exports to Home.
