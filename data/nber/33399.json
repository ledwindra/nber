    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper studies household inequality and product market power in dynamic, general equilibrium. In our model, households\u2019 price elasticities of demand endogenously vary with wealth. Heterogeneous firms set their price as oligopolistic competitors given the endogenous distribution of demand. A firm\u2019s market power varies with the distribution of demand as households with different elasticities sort into high- and low-price varieties. Under standard preferences, larger firms\u2019 products are more appealing, sell at higher prices, to more households, and a relatively richer customer base, face less elastic demand, and set higher markups. Quantitatively (a) our model rationalizes a wide set of recent empirical studies in the cross-section of households and firms, (b) we find household heterogeneity to be a dominant source of markup variation across firms, and (c) a one-time fiscal transfer of one percent of GDP to households leads to a 0.3 percentage point increase in the aggregate markup.\n\n",
