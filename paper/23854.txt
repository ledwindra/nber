ABSTRACT
How do climate risk beliefs affect coastal housing markets? This paper provides theoretical and
empirical evidence. First, we build a dynamic housing market model and show that belief
heterogeneity can reconcile the mixed empirical evidence on flood risk capitalization into
housing prices. Second, we implement a field survey in Rhode Island. We find significant
heterogeneity and sorting based on flood risk perceptions and amenity values. Third, we calibrate
the model and estimate that coastal prices currently exceed fundamentals by 10%. Ignoring
heterogeneity leads to a four-fold underestimate of future coastal home price declines due to sea
level rise.

Introduction

How do climate risks a¤ect coastal housing markets? In a world with homogeneous rational expectations, vulnerable housing prices should have already adjusted to incorporate the
present value of future ‡ood risk increases due to sea level rise. If, however, agents have
heterogeneous beliefs about climate risks, the housing market implications may be starkly
di¤erent. From an asset pricing perspective, it is well known that heterogeneity in beliefs
about the future value of fundamentals can lead to in‡ated prices and a host of associated
risks including bubbles, excess volatility, overinvestment, and credit crises (e.g., Harrison
and Kreps, 1978; Abreu and Brunnermeier, 2003; Scheinkman and Xiong, 2003; Geanakoplos, 2010; Simsek, 2013; Xiong, 2013). While heterogeneity appears intuitively relevant for
‡ood and climate risk perceptions in the United States, standard approaches to modeling
the economic impacts of sea level rise have assumed homogeneous beliefs, thus potentially
underestimating its broader economic rami…cations.
This paper studies the implications of heterogeneity in ‡ood risk beliefs for coastal U.S.
housing markets. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence. First, we develop a
dynamic housing market model building on recent literature advancements on heterogeneous
beliefs and housing prices (e.g., Piazzesi and Schneider, 2009; Favara and Song, 2014, Burnside, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo, 2016). Our theoretical innovation is the introduction of three
novel dimensions of heterogeneity, speci…cally (i) in the housing stock, di¤erentiating coastal
from non-coastal homes, (ii) in households’amenity valuations of waterfront living, and (iii)
in households’current and future ‡ood risk perceptions. We …rst present a simpli…ed version of the model and compare its predictions for how ‡ood risks should factor into housing
prices with the empirical evidence. A rich literature has generally found mixed results on the
capitalization of climatic risks. For example, in a comprehensive national study, Bernstein,
Gustafson, and Lewis (2018) …nd that while sea level rise vulnerability induces a signi…cant
discount in the sophisticated (non-owner occupied) housing market segment, it fails to do
so in the general owner-occupied segment. Other studies have found results ranging from
2

zero or positive ‡ood zone premiums to signi…cant negative e¤ects.1 We demonstrate that a
heterogeneous beliefs model can reconcile these results through sorting resulting in di¤erent
equilibria depending on the distribution of beliefs and other housing market characteristics.
We therefore argue that a heterogeneous agent model matches the empirical evidence strictly
better than the benchmark homogeneous rational beliefs model.
Second, in order to provide direct evidence and inform a plausible calibration of beliefs, we
implement a door-to-door survey campaign in Rhode Island. Importantly, this methodology
enables us to elicit ‡ood risk perceptions and amenity values among both households that did
and did not purchase properties on the coast.2 The results con…rm signi…cant heterogeneity,
and that selection into coastal homes appears to be driven by both lower risk perceptions
and higher amenity values for waterfront living. For example, we …nd that the majority of
coastal residents underestimate their homes’‡ood risks relative to inundation models, and
that 40% of ‡ood zone respondents say they are "not at all" worried about ‡ooding over the
next ten years. In contrast, a plurality of respondents living further inland indicate that they
would be "very worried" about ‡ooding if they lived on the coast. We also con…rm that these
di¤erences are not driven by di¤erential expectations of damages, government assistance, or
insurance reimbursements in case of a ‡ood.
Third, we present a fully speci…ed and calibrated version of the model in order to quantify
the potential implications of these beliefs for coastal housing markets under sea level rise. As
the simulations require a speci…cation of both …rst- and higher-order belief dynamics, here
we further introduce a ‡exible Bayesian learning framework that allows agents to update
their ‡ood risk beliefs each period, in line with empirical evidence on response patterns after
‡ood events (Gallagher, 2014).3 We also couple sea level rise estimates from the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

See, e.g., Kousky (2010), Bin and Landry, (2013), Atreya and Czajkowski (2016), and Section 2.
Sections 3 and 4 further motivate the use of stated preference methods by highlighting the limitations
of hedonic approaches in estimating the desired parameters of interest from housing sales data.
We consider both rational Bayesian learning and an ‘overreactive’updating rule in order to better match
the empirical literature’s …ndings on the responses of housing prices (e.g., Hallstrom and Smith, 2005;
Atreya and Ferreira, 2015) and insurance demand (Gallagher, 2014) to ‡ood events.

with ‡ood risk probabilities from a state-of-the-art geospatial ‡ood model (STORMTOOLS)
to estimate current and future property-speci…c inundation return rates.
The benchmark results imply that coastal housing prices currently exceed fundamentals
by 10%, and that ignoring belief heterogeneity may lead modelers to underestimate the
outstanding coastal home price declines due to sea level rise over the next 25 years by
a factor of four. The estimated overvaluation is economically signi…cant and robust to a
range of robustness checks and extensions, such as alternative belief updating rules. We also
conduct a hedonic analysis of housing prices in our empirical setting to ensure that the results
are robust to, and in line with, revealed preference indicators of coastal amenity valuations
and ‡ood zone penalties. The main sensitivity of the results is with regards to higher
future ‡ood risk increases or higher population prevalences of ‡ood risk optimism (and/or
climate change skepticism), which are projected to increase contemporary coastal home price
overvaluations up to 20%. In contrast, for markets dominated by agents with ‘realistic’‡ood
risk beliefs (i.e., in line with the scienti…c forecast), mispricing is predicted to be negligible
(0-2%), in line with the empirical literature’s …ndings of signi…cant climate risk penalties in
sophisticated markets (Bernstein, Gustafson, and Lewis, 2018). The simulations also reveal
that households’beliefs about long-run ‡ood insurance policy changes can signi…cantly a¤ect
coastal housing prices in the present, highlighting the potential power of policy expectations
to mitigate - or exacerbate - current ine¢ ciencies.
These …ndings have important policy and welfare implications. First, they highlight
the value of better ‡ood risk information and communication. While the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) publishes o¢ cial ‡ood maps, these are backwards-looking and
often out of date, with 1 in 6 maps being over 20 years old.4 Our framework demonstrates
how the absence of accurate ‡ood risk information can threaten the e¢ ciency of coastal
housing markets. Second, coastal mispricing creates welfare costs. We quantify the allocative
ine¢ ciency of agents with high amenity values for waterfront living being priced out of coastal

areas by agents with lower amenity values but optimistic ‡ood risk beliefs. While we do not
model the mortgage origination process and the use of coastal properties as collateral, we
note the potential for signi…cant additional welfare costs through this channel.5 Finally,
our results highlight the potential impacts of ‡ood insurance policy reform. The need for
changes to the National Flood Insurance Program is well established as the program remains
…scally insolvent. As of the end of the 2017 …scal year, FEMA owed $30.4 billion to the U.S.
Treasury (GAO, 2018a).6 We model an insurance mandate at actuarially fair rates which
would force the internalization of real risk rates and re-align coastal housing prices with
fundamentals. Though e¢ cient, this policy raises fundamental distributional concerns. Our
simulations moreover highlight a trade-o¤ in the timing of reform: completing policy changes
in 15 rather than 25 years can cut allocative ine¢ ciency in half, but triples price volatility
in the interim.

Literature

This paper builds on extremely rich literatures, including prior studies on housing prices and
dynamics, residential sorting, and new work analyzing the impact of climate skepticism on
asset markets. We …rst review and highlight our contributions to these broader literatures,
and then describe the empirical evidence speci…c to ‡ood risks, ‡ood events, and housing
markets in the subsection below.
First, the literature on housing price dynamics spans contributions from macroeconomics,
…nance, and urban economics (see, e.g., recent reviews by Davis and Van Nieuwerburgh,
2014, and Glaeser and Nathanson, 2014). Most closely related to our work are several recent
papers that incorporate heterogeneous beliefs into housing market models. Both Piazzesi and
Schneider (2009) and Burnside, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2016, "BER") present (quasi)5

6

For example, the devaluation of coastal properties could lead to defaults and adverse credit market
impacts (see, e.g., Geanakoplos, 2010), thereby exacerbating market incompleteness.
In October 2017, Congress forgave $16 billion of this debt. In February 2018, FEMA’s debt totalled
$20.5 billion (GAO, 2018b) but the …scal e¤ects of Hurricane Florence are still being determined.

linear utility models of housing markets with search-and-matching frictions, and combine
their models with Michigan Consumer and American Housing Survey data on households’
expectations. Piazzesi and Schneider consider a one-time unanticipated shock that makes all
renters optimistic about future prices to study the e¤ects of momentum traders. BER present
a detailed analysis of "social dynamics" in housing markets. With a known probability, each
period the fundamental value of homes may change permanently to a new level. Optimists
expect this new value to be higher than ‘skeptical’or ‘vulnerable’agents. However, agents
can ‘infect’ each other with their opinions, generating social dynamics in beliefs and thus
housing booms and busts. Our approach builds on, but di¤erentiates itself from, BER in
several ways. On the one hand, we currently abstract from search-and-matching frictions,
a major simpli…cation, and do not focus on infectious social dynamics. On the other hand,
we extend BER’s model by adding several dimensions of heterogeneity relevant for ‡ood
risks, by allowing beliefs to evolve in response to external shocks (‡ood events) in a ‡exible
Bayesian learning framework. More broadly, our paper also presents the …rst (to the best of
our knowledge) application of these heterogeneous beliefs frameworks to formalize the e¤ects
of climatic risk belief heterogeneity on coastal housing prices, and we produce both novel
survey evidence and a quanti…cation to apply the model to this new area of critical policy
importance and academic interest.
Second, another vast literature has studied residential sorting and its implications for
hedonic valuations of amenity values, including environmental attributes such as air quality
(Kumino¤, Smith, and Timmins, 2013). While most of this literature has focused on static settings, recent advances include dynamic structural estimation models of neighborhood
choice (Bayer, McMillan, Murphy, and Timmins, 2016, “BMMT"). While our framework
takes a fundamentally di¤erent approach from these studies, some of our results relate closely.
For example, Section 3 demonstrates the importance of future price and ‡ood risk expectations as a driver of current sorting and thus equilibrium home prices. Ignoring these dynamic
considerations can lead to a biased assessment of risk capitalization. These results thus echo

6

BMMT’s …nding that static estimates of amenity values may over- or under-estimate true
values if those amenities are expected to change in the future.
Finally, our study also contributes to new work on the asset pricing impacts of climate
skepticism. In an empirical analysis of land markets, Severen, Costello, and Deschenes (2018)
…nd that climate change predictions are incorporated in contemporary prices, but only partly
so. They note that counties with greater acceptance of climate change - measured through
national survey data from the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication - incorporate
future expectations to a greater degree than counties with lower beliefs. As described below,
these results echo the …nding of Bernstein, Gustafson, and Lewis (2018) that sea level rise
vulnerability is capitalized into owner-occupied housing prices only in areas with su¢ ciently
strong climate change beliefs as measured by the Yale survey. In addition, Kahn and Zhao
(2018) present a theoretical framework to analyze the potential impacts of climate change
skeptics in a spatial equilibrium between two cities, …nding that skeptics would be expected
to lower the price of land in the cooler city less impacted by climate change. As accurate
pricing of climate risks is essential for markets to incentivize e¢ cient adaptation (Anderson
et al., 2018), understanding potential impediments to e¢ cient climate asset pricing is thus
important not only for public policy, but also for this emerging literature.

2.1

Empirical Flood Risk Literature

One of our core contributions is to present a model of coastal home price dynamics that
can match and reconcile the rich yet mixed empirical evidence on ‡ood risk capitalization in
housing prices. In this section, we highlight key …ndings in this literature and connect them
with a preview of our model highlights, formally elaborated in Section 3.
One prominent approach in this literature is to study the e¤ects of ‡ood or sea level
rise risk on housing prices. Of particular relevance, Bernstein, Gustafson, and Lewis (2018,
"BGL") present highly detailed and comprehensive empirical evidence on sea level rise (SLR)
risk impacts on coastal housing markets across the United States. They combine national
7

Zillow ZTRAX data on housing prices and characteristics from 2007 to 2016 with National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) elevation and SLR exposure measures,
such as whether a home would be inundated at a certain SLR level. Their central …nding is
that climate risk capitalization is heterogeneous across market segments. In the sophisticated
(non-owner occupied) segment, they …nd a signi…cant and large (7%) discount associated
with SLR exposure. However, for regular owner-occupied homes, BGL fail to detect a significant SLR vulnerability discount (even when controlling for the amenity value of waterfront
proximity in detailed distance bins).
Our model and survey evidence can potentially explain BGL’s results as due to sorting
into vulnerable properties by households with comparatively low concerns over ‡ood and
climate risks that deviate from scienti…c forecasts. In further support of this mechanism,
BGL …nd that, at a national level, sea level rise exposure is signi…cantly and negatively
correlated with county-level measures of general worry about global warming from the Yale
Climate Survey. Only in markets with su¢ ciently high general reported levels of worry do
properties incur signi…cant SLR exposure discounts in the owner-occupied market segment,
consistent with our model’s predictions. Intuitively, the more agents with realistic beliefs
there are in a housing market, the more likely it is that they will be the marginal buyer
pricing the asset.
Finally, our model can also account for BGL’s results on the dynamics of climate risk
discounts over time and in response to news about sea level rise. Among sophisticated
buyers, BGL …nd that coastal homes’ sea level rise discount jumps in response to news
of worsening sea level rise predictions, and increases over time. This is what our model
predicts should occur in markets dominated by agents with realistic beliefs. In contrast,
BGL …nd no response to sea level rise news nor a trend over time in the SLR discount
among owner-occupied homes. Again, our model and survey results showcase that this lack
of response should occur in markets dominated by agents whose beliefs diverge from the
scienti…c forecast, and who are more likely to sort into vulnerable properties as a result. In

8

discussing the implications of their …ndings, BGL hypothesize that the lack of internalization
of climate risks could expose owner-occupied homes to future value shocks, which are of
particular concern given the prominence of housing wealth in households’retirement savings
(Campbell, 2006). This paper develops an empirically calibrated structural model of coastal
housing prices which can formalize this idea and quantify the potential magnitude of these
shocks under di¤erent climate, policy, and belief scenarios.
The broader literature has commonly focused on the capitalization of current day ‡ood
risk and o¢ cial ‡ood zone status in speci…c geographic areas. The relevant policy background
is as follows. FEMA produces ‡ood risk maps for most coastal communities across the
United States, and designates places with an annual inundation risk exceeding 1 in 100
as "Special Flood Hazard Areas." In principle, this designation activates a ‡ood insurance
requirement for homes with federally insured or regulated mortgages. Through the National
Flood Insurance Program - the dominant insurer for ‡ooding in the United States - policies
may even be available at subsidized rates (see discussion in Section 5). In reality, however,
‡ood insurance take-up is surprisingly limited. By some estimates, only 30 to 50 percent of
structures in high risk areas are covered by insurance (Harrison, Smersh, Schwartz, 2001;
Kousky et al., 2018). This …nding is consistent with both limited enforcement of insurance
requirements and low ‡ood risk perceptions among ‡ood zone home buyers.7
Consistent with this idea, empirical studies generally …nd weak capitalization of ‡ood risk
and ‡ood zone status into coastal housing prices (see meta analyses by, e.g., Daniel, Florax,
and Rietveld, 2009; Beltrán, Maddison, and Elliott, 2018). Studies often fail to detect a
signi…cant negative e¤ects, or may even …nd positive premiums for coastal ‡ood zones (e.g.,
Atreya and Czajkowski, 2016; Bin and Kruse, 2006). Others …nd ‡ood risk discounts that
are signi…cant but less than the present value of insurance premiums, suggesting only partial
7

Of course expectations of damages and public assistance in case of ‡ood events could also explain low
insurance take-up; we therefore elicit beliefs of both in our survey. In reality, post-disaster payouts
are small, typically in the thousands of dollars, and are not meant to cover total property damage
(Kousky, 2013). Indeed, FEMA assistance is capped at $33k even for eligible individuals whose homes
are destroyed by a ‡ood.

9

capitalization (Harrison, Smersh, Schwartz, 2001). In some cases, studies also …nd signi…cant
‡ood risk penalties (e.g., Bin, Crawford, Kruse, and Landry, 2008), particularly for inland
‡ood zones, that suggest appropriate internalization of ‡ood risks. Overall, the results of
the broader literature thus echo those of BGL that ‡ood risk capitalization is often limited
but heterogeneous across markets. Importantly, our model can account for this stylized
fact as ‡ood risk penalties are predicted to depend on market-speci…c variables, such as
the distribution of risk beliefs and amenity valuations relative to the size of the coastal
housing segment. In contrast, a homogeneous rational beliefs framework would imply full
capitalization across all markets and time, counterfactual to the empirical evidence.
A second strand of the literature analyzes the impacts of ‡ood events on housing markets.
These studies have repeatedly found that prices of properties that are at high risk of, but
were not damaged by, a ‡ood typically drop sharply in the aftermath of an event, with
impact estimates ranging from around 5-20 percent (e.g., Hallstrom and Smith, 2005; Kousky,
2010; Bin and Landry, 2013; Ortega and Taspinar, 2018). These price ‡uctuations are
di¢ cult to rationalize as based on changes in fundamentals, but are consistent with market
participants increasing their implied ‡ood risk beliefs in response to an event. However,
studies that track longer run impacts typically …nd that prices return to baseline within 4-10
years (e.g., Bin and Landry, 2013; Atreya, Ferreira, Kiresel, 2013). Importantly, Gallagher
(2014) documents an analogous impact pattern in national ‡ood insurance markets, where
take-up rises sharply after ‡ood events, but gradually declines back to baseline within a
decade. Given these results, Gallagher (2014) demonstrates that ‡ood risk learning is most
consistent with a modi…ed Bayesian updating model. We incorporate these …ndings from
the empirical literature directly into our model and calibration, speci…cally by allowing for
Bayesian learning about ‡ood risks (with and without relevant behavioral adjustments) in
the full model speci…cation.
A …nal new empirical study of note, Gibson, Mullins, and Hill (2017) analyze the impacts
of three ‡ood risk signals on property prices in New York City: (i) the Biggert-Waters Flood

10

Insurance Reform Act (described in Section 5), (ii) Hurricane Sandy, and (iii) updates to
FEMA ‡ood zone maps. The results indicate signi…cant price declines due to both ‡ooding
(5-13%) and FEMA map updates (18%), consistent with a signi…cant increase in marginal
buyers’ ‡ood risk beliefs in response to the event. These empirical …ndings are yet again
di¢ cult to reconcile with a model of rational ‡ood and climate risk beliefs, but can be
matched by our framework, where news about ‡ood risks (such as FEMA map updates) can
be internalized to varying degrees and at di¤ering rates depending on the distribution of
beliefs and housing stock vulnerability, as described in the next section.

Model Intuition

This section presents a simpli…ed version of our model and illustrates how empirically observed ‡ood risk premiums would be expected to di¤er under alternative belief distributions.
As the purpose of this section is to provide basic intuition, several model elements are left
implicit until Section 5, which presents a full speci…cation with proper formality.
Our setup follows Burnside, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2016, "BER") in studying an
economy populated by a continuum of agents with linear utility and utility discount rate
: As in BER, agents can own one home or rent, houses cannot be sold short, and there
is a …xed stock of houses available for sale k < 1:8 We …rst introduce heterogeneity in the
housing stock: fraction k1 < k of homes are "coastal" properties (empirically later de…ned
as within 400 feet of the waterfront). Coastal properties di¤er from inland homes in two
dimensions. One, they provide an additional ‡ow utility value of

i

; which is indexed by i to

indicate that it may vary across households. Two, each period, coastal homes incur net ‡ood
damages

In principle, one could model households as expecting gross

We thus abstract from (endogenous) housing supply. Empirical estimates …nd supply in coastal areas
to be highly inelastic, driven by topographic constraints (Glaeser, Gyourko, and Saks, 2005; Green,
Malpezzi, and Mayo, 2005). Saiz (2010) estimates MSA-level elasticities, …nding Miami, Los Angeles,
Fort Lauderdale, and San Francisco to have the lowest supply elasticities. In contrast, for a detailed
theoretical analysis of how developers of open coastal real estate may respond to climate risks of land
and investment destruction, see Bunten and Kahn (2017).

damages e net of government transfers Gi in case of a ‡ood, and allow these expectations

to vary across households. However, we focus on net damages

as FEMA disaster aid is,

in reality, very small (typically a few thousand dollars, Kousky, 2013), and as our survey
results suggest that heterogeneity in ‡ood risk concern is not driven by di¤erences in beliefs
about public assistance. By the same token, we also leave insurance premiums and payouts
implicit in the model, but note that they would be straightforward to add, especially given
the linear utility framework. Importantly, however, we allow households to disagree with the
o¢ cial or scienti…cally forecast ‡ood risk trajectory f s g1
s=t and hold their own …rst-order
beliefs f is g1
s=t : Higher-order beliefs are left implicit in the expectations operator here, but
made explicit in Section 5:
The rental market, also as in BER, consists of 1

k homes which are produced by

competitive …rms charging a rental rate of w per period. The ‡ow utilities of owning versus
renting a home are given by "h and "r ; respectively. Each period, households thus face the
decision of whether to (i) buy a non-coastal home at price PtN C ; (ii) buy a coastal home at
price Pt ; or (iii) rent (inland). We focus on a frictionless housing market where prices are
determined by the valuation of the marginal buyer. Letting mt index his identity at time t,
in equilibrium, the marginal buyer must be just indi¤erent between his options:

Pt + ("h +

Intuitively, (2) indicates that coastal home prices depend on the marginal buyer’s amenity
values, current ‡ood risk beliefs, and re-sale value expectations, which, in turn, depend on
12

the agent’s (…rst- and higher-order) beliefs about future ‡ood risks.
For the remainder of this section, we assume - broadly in line with the survey results - that
coastal amenity values are independently and uniformly distributed with f ( i )

Next, consider a stylized representation of climate change expectations where, at t = 0;

It is easy to show (through backwards iteration from the new long-run coastal home price

negative until converging to its new long-term value. That is, the ‡ood risk premium should
immediately incorporate the present discounted cost of future ‡ood risk increases:

(8)

With homogeneous rational beliefs, observed ‡ood risk penalties should thus be unambiguously negative and growing in full anticipation of climate change-induced future risk increases.10 This prediction is clearly counterfactual for many segments of the U.S. housing
market, as described in Section 2. Our robustness analysis in Section 6:3 similarly presents
hedonic estimates of the ‡ood risk premium over a longer time horizon (1970-2017) in our

Equations (7)-(8) implicitly assume that damages conditional on a ‡ood event ( ) are not expected to

empirical setting, which also fails to match this predicted pattern. The next sub-section
consequently proposes a generalization of the standard model to accommodate belief heterogeneity as potential explanation of these empirically observed risk capitalization patterns.

3.2

Heterogeneous Beliefs

With heterogeneity, the marginal buyer’s ‡ood risk beliefs pricing coastal homes (2) may
well diverge from the scienti…c forecast. In order to illustrate speci…c examples of equilibria
with heterogeneous beliefs, we now generalize the homogeneous beliefs model to allow for
two belief types. Fraction (1

As before, the market-clearing marginal buyer will be the agent with the k1st valuation for
coastal properties. There are now three general cases to consider, which we argue can broadly
span the di¤erent results observed in the empirical literature.
3.2.1

Case 1

First, if there are more optimists than coastal homes (

o

> k1 ), it is possible that only

optimists will live on the coast. This case occurs if even the realist with the highest possible
amenity value (

r

=

) assigns a lower value to buying a coastal home than the (then

In this case, the marginal optimist’s amenity value bo must clear the market:

Rearranging (11) reveals that (10) will hold if risk perceptions are su¢ ciently di¤erent:
k1

Eto [Pt+1 ]g < (

(12)

The equilibrium coastal home price in this setting is then de…ned by:

Pt = (eh +

o

The cross-sectional ‡ood risk premium - estimated as ceteris paribus home price change with
respect to o¢ cial risk

- now di¤ers from the homogeneous model’s prediction (7) in two

dimensions:

(13a)

Future Risk E¤ect

Eto [Pt+1 ] denotes the change in optimists’expectations of the re-sale value of coastal

homes across areas with higher o¢ cial ‡ood risk.
On the one hand, the current risk capitalization is now attenuated by optimists’ discounting of ‡ood risk (1

Opt
t ):

The survey results suggest that 50% of coastal homeowners

in our sample underestimate their homes’‡ood risk by 50% or more, implying a potentially
substantive value for

Opt
t :

In addition, the future risk internalization is generally also atten-

16

uated compared to the homogeneous beliefs case.11 We formalize this statement in Section
5. The central point here, however, that a heterogeneous beliefs model can account for the
empirically observed under-capitalization of current and future ‡ood risks in markets with
a su¢ cient density of excessively optimistic (or climate skeptical) households.
3.2.2

Case 2

Next, Case 2 occurs when both optimists and realists buy coastal homes. The marginal
buyers’valuations are then equated:

(eh +

r
t

r
t

o
t

+ Etr [Pt+1 ]) = (eh +

o

+ Eto [Pt+1 ]) = Pt

Intuitively, the marginal realist in this setting has a su¢ ciently high amenity value

(14)

r
t

so

as to equate their coastal home valuation to that of the marginal optimist. The marginal
amenity values and thus equilibrium prices are then pinned down jointly by (14) and the
market clearing condition:

o

(1

r

(

(15)

now has the interesting e¤ect that it will

alter the identity and thus amenity values of the marginal buyers, in addition to changing
the valuation of ‡ood risks. That is, the cross-sectional ‡ood risk premium (across two
otherwise identical housing markets in equilibrium Case 2) would contain impacts of both
sorting and potentially underestimated current (and future) risks:

P REMtF lood = (
11

r
t

+

Etr [Pt+1 ]) = (

o

(1

Opt

+

Eto [Pt+1 ])

(16)

Optimists may underestimate future ‡ood risk levels H in (6) either by directly discounting the sealevel rise projection ( SLR ), or indirectly even if they believe that sea-level rise will increase ‡ood risks
by factor SLR if they apply this factor to an under-estimated baseline ‡ood risk level as in (9).

17

Since the direct e¤ect of higher ‡ood risk on optimists’coastal home price valuations is weakly
less negative than the realists’( (1

Opt
t )

), and assuming that the same will be true

of the corresponding impact on future home price expectations ( Eto [Pt+1 ]

Etr [Pt+1 ]),

the marginal realist in the higher risk setting must have higher amenity values for waterfront
living (
(

o
t

r
t

> 0), whereas the marginal optimists moving must have lower amenity values

< 0). This comparative static also illustrates the allocative ine¢ ciency resulting from

heterogeneous ‡ood risk beliefs. Importantly for our purposes, however, (16) highlights why
the presence of some market participants with realistic ‡ood risk beliefs is not necessarily
su¢ cient to ensure that those risks are fully capitalized into coastal housing prices, in line
with the empirical evidence.
3.2.3

Case 3

Finally, if there are fewer optimists than coastal homes (

o

< k1 ), the marginal buyer is

trivially a realist. In this case, the marginal realist’s amenity value br must clear the market

for coastal homes net of the space already occupied by the optimists:
o

(1

)

br ) = k

(

o

The equilibrium price in this setting will then satisfy:

Pt = (eh +

1

o

(k1
(1

r
t

+ Etr [Pt+1 ])

(17)

The ‡ood risk premium in this type of market would then be:

(18)

Future Risk E¤ect

The current ‡ood risk capitalization in this market thus matches that of the homogeneous
rational expectations setting. Since realists will remain marginal buyers, their future risk
18

internalization should moreover capture the full climate change forecast. It should be noted
that coastal home price levels (17) are still distorted in this setting as some optimists with
lower amenity values take up coastal real estate that should, from an e¢ ciency perspective,
go to realists with higher amenity values. If realists expect that these optimists will one day
change their beliefs to match the o¢ cial forecast, thus exiting the coastal property market,
realists would anticipate an additional future devaluation due to this correction to optimists’
beliefs. Overall, however, the heterogeneous beliefs model can thus also accommodate the
…nding that markets dominated by agents with realistic ‡ood risk beliefs are likely to internalize these and future climate risks, again in line with the empirical evidence (Bernstein,
Gustafson, and Lewis, 2018).

Direct Evidence: Field Survey

The analysis thus far indicates that a housing market model with heterogeneity in ‡ood
risk beliefs …ts the empirical evidence better than a benchmark homogeneous rational beliefs
model. At the same time, however, the model illustrates the structural challenges inherent
in seeking to isolate risk beliefs from hedonically estimated ‡ood risk premiums. Through
the lens of the model, these premiums depend not only on beliefs about the current risk
of ‡ooding, but also on expectations about future housing prices

Etmt [Pt+1 ] (and thus

implicitly future ‡ood risks) and net ‡ood damages , which, in turn, may further depend
on households’ beliefs about factors such as government assistance in case of a ‡ood. We
therefore turn to surveys as a methodology that can elicit these beliefs individually, and
provide more direct evidence on heterogeneity and sorting. For example, we elicit coastal
‡ood risk perceptions among both residents that did and did not purchase coastal homes,
the latter of which cannot be inferred through market transactions, but is critical to the
question of sorting. Of course, the results are subject to the well-known limitations of stated
preference elicitation. We therefore complement the survey with a hedonic analysis of housing

19

prices in our setting, and use its results to inform the robustness analysis in Section 6:3.

4.1

Design

We conduct in-person surveys through a door-to-door campaign in Rhode Island, targeting
communities with both coastal (de…ned as within 400 feet of the coast) and non-coastal
homes.12 The surveys were conducted in two waves across February and July 2017. The
survey instruments are provided in the Appendix. The key components of the survey are
as follows. First, we elicit households’ceteris paribus willingness to pay (WTP) for living
within 400 feet of the water using a double-bounded dichotomous choice (DBDC) choice
contingent valuation mechanism (Hanemann, Loomis, and Kanninen, 1991).13 Both our
use of face-to-face interviews and the DBDC mechanism are motivated by best practices
recommendations in Contingent Valuation survey design and implementation (Arrow et al.,
1993; Mitchell and Carson, 2013). Guided by the literature on e¢ cient starting bid design
(Kanninen, 1993; Alberini, 1995), the three starting bids of $150, $250, and $350 were chosen
based on a hedonic estimation of the annualized waterfront living premium using U.S. Census
American Housing Survey data for 2013 performed by the authors. The DBDC question was
asked early in the survey to avoid bias due to priming with ‡ood risk information (Cameron
and James, 1987; Arrow et al., 1993; Hanemann, 1994; Carson and Mitchell, 1995).
Second, we elicit coastal ‡ood risk perceptions. In line with best practices in the risk
elicitation literature (Manski, 2004), we consider both quantitative and qualitative subjective risk measures. The quantitative elicitation asks subjects about their perception of the
probability of experiencing at least one ‡ood over the course of the next 10 years. Coastal
12

13

Two key model features motivate the need for an original door-to-door survey campaign rather than
leveraging existing survey products. First, while prominent publicly-available surveys exist assessing
‡ood risk perception across the United States (e.g., FEMA, 2013), our model requires the joint distribution of both waterfront living valuation and ‡ood risk perception at the household level. Second, to
assess the existence and frequency of optimists in the market, we need to compare homeowner ‡ood risk
perception with hydrological ‡ood risk at the property level, the latter of which is often not collected
or collected at a courser level (see review by Kellens et al., 2013).
For sensitivity, we also estimate WTP using a single-bounded dichotomous choice with the …rst bid and
…nd the mean WTP to be similar (11% lower).

20

residents are asked about their homes speci…cally, whereas non-coastal residents are asked to
consider a home like theirs located within 400 feet of the waterfront in their community. As
a visual aid, subjects are shown a table of both natural frequencies and probabilities. Next,
as a qualitative measure we ask subjects to indicate how worried they are on a 10-point
scale about the risk of a ‡ood a¤ecting their or a coastal home over the next 10 years. This
question format is motivated by the …ndings of Schade, Kunreuther, and Koellinger (2012)
that such a worry scale performs signi…cantly better as a predictor of demand for insurance
against low probability disasters than quantitative subjective probability measures.
Third, the survey asks subjects about several potential confounders that could a¤ect
concern about ‡ooding even in the absence of heterogeneity in ‡ood probability beliefs per
se, including expectations over ‡ood damages, insurance reimbursements, and government
assistance. We also ask about ‡ood experiences and intentions to sell or buy a home in the
next …ve years. Finally, the survey asks subjects about their beliefs about changes in future
‡ood risk and the climate. We supplement demographic information elicited in the survey
with publicly available information on home characteristics from tax assessor records.
This section reports results from n = 187 interviews (52% coastal, 48% non-coastal)
conducted with households in several Rhode Island communities.14 Though not designed
to be statistically representative, it should be noted that this sample size does compare
reasonably with prior survey studies of household ‡ood risk perceptions, particularly ones
using face-to-face interviewing techniques.15
14

15

The study design and implementation was approved by Brown University and the University of Arizona’s Institutional Review Boards and all surveyors completed the Collaborative Institutional Training
Initiative training. Informed consent was obtained from all respondents. Respondents were also compensated $5 for agreeing to take the survey although some respondents declined compensation. Close to
40% of people who answered their doors agreed to take the survey. The overall response rate (including
unanswered doors) of approximately 12.5% was fully in line with DellaVigna, List, and Malmendier’s
(2012) response rates of 10-15% in their unannounced door-to-door survey treatment groups.
For example, Pagneux et al. (2011) present face-to-face interviews on ‡ood risk perceptions with n = 112
subjects in Iceland. Lindell and Hwang (2008) present a mail survey with n = 321 responses. Kellens,
Zaalberg, and De Maeyr (2012) utilize n = 266 complete online surveys (based on 313 responses). See
also meta analysis by Kellens, Terpstra, and De Maeyer (2013).

Survey Results

First, we …nd strong evidence of heterogeneity in ‡ood risk perceptions. In line with the
sorting mechanism implied by the model, we …nd that coastal residents appear signi…cantly
less concerned than inland residents when asked about their coastal ‡ood risk perceptions, as
shown in Figure 1. Perhaps more strikingly, we also …nd that those living in o¢ cial FEMA
high-risk ‡ood zones appear signi…cantly less worried about ‡ood risks than those whose
homes are outside the ‡ood zone, as shown in Figure 2.

Of course one may be concerned that a low degree of worry could be driven by di¤erences
in expectations over losses conditional on a ‡ood, rather than ‡ood risk itself. Figure 3
showcases the distribution of expected ‡ood damages (as percentage of home value) net of
expected insurance reimbursements and government assistance.16 While ‡ood zone residents
generally expect slightly lower damages, they also expect less insurance and government
assistance (see Table 1). The net damage expectations are thus very similar across the two

non-‡ood zone residents. Beyond exhibiting highly signi…cantly lower ‡ood risk concerns,
‡ood zone residents di¤er from non-‡ood zone residents mainly in having smaller households
and homes. The central take-home point is thus that we …nd evidence of signi…cant heterogeneity in concerns about ‡ooding that does not appear to be driven by di¤erences in
confounders such as government or insurance assistance expectations.
The results presented thus far focus on ‡ood risk perceptions measured by a worry index.
However, we also elicit numerical ‡ood risk beliefs. Figure 4 compares these perceptions
with respondents’ homes’ 10-year ‡ood risk estimates derived from storm surge elevation
risk models (described in Section 5:1:1). Importantly, this estimation takes into account
each property’s elevation. The sample is restricted to coastal homes so that responses re‡ect
‡ood risk estimates speci…c to respondents’homes. Assessments that agree with the storm
24

surge model should be near the 45 line. However, 70% of answers lie beneath the 45 line,
again suggesting that many coastal residents underestimate the ‡ood risks they face.

With regards to ‡ood risk perceptions, the survey provides evidence on two additional elements of the model. First, households that have experienced a naturally caused ‡ood at their
homes are signi…cantly more likely to be concerned about ‡ooding (see Appendix Figure A1).
Second, coastal residents who are very worried about ‡ooding are signi…cantly more likely

Both results are in line with the model’s central mechanisms that households learn about
‡ooding from past events, and are more likely to select out of coastal property markets as
their ‡ood risk perceptions increase.
The second main goal of the survey is to assess household-speci…c willingness-to-pay
(WTP) for living within 400 feet of the waterfront. While we also present hedonic housing
price estimates for comparison (see Appendix), these confound amenity values, sorting, and
future coastal home price expectations, and provide information only on the marginal buyers.
We therefore use the survey both in an e¤ort to elicit ceteris paribus valuations, and to
gauge the distribution of amenity values across agents who did not purchase coastal homes.
The survey question thus asks households about their WTP assuming that all other home
attributes - including environmental risks - remain unchanged compared to their current
homes. If households ask for clari…cation, surveyors were instructed to explain that this
includes ‡ood risks, and that the question asks strictly about the amenity value of living by
the water without changes in ‡ood risks or insurance requirements. Estimation details are
presented in the Appendix.
26

Figure 6 plots the joint sample distribution of coastal amenity values and ‡ood risk
perceptions among coastal (circles) and non-coastal (x’s) residents. The results indicate
that selection into coastal homes is driven by a combination of higher amenity values and
lower ‡ood risk concerns, in line with the core mechanisms of the model. Figure 6 also
provides a visual gauge on allocative ine¢ ciency, which appears to be mild in our sample:
few non-coastal households hold waterfront amenity values above those of coastal residents.

With regards to risk belief types, we classify respondents as ‘optimists’if they underestimate coastal 10-year ‡ood risk by at least

50%. Speci…cally, respondents are ‘optimists’

if their subjective coastal 10-year ‡ood risk assessment in our study area is between 0

5%:

In fact, FEMA high ‡ood risk zone residents’annual ‡ooding probability is at least 1%; implying a 10-year probability of at least one ‡ood around 9:6%:18 While the mean of amenity
values is slightly higher for optimists than for realists, the distributions appear su¢ ciently
similar in the two populations that we maintain the assumption of equal
18

distributions

While not all coastal homes in our sample are in a FEMA ‡ood zone due to their elevation, other homes’
risks exceed 1% per year. As we estimate the average annual ‡ood risk for coastal homes in our sample
to exceed 1% per year (see Section 5:1:1), using a 1% …gure is thus conservative.

27

as a benchmark in the calibration below. Finally, the results indicate that the majority of
respondents expect future ‡ood risks to be at least "somewhat greater" than current risks.
Figure 7 plots the distribution of these beliefs across types. As expected, realists are more
likely to assume higher future ‡ood risk increases than optimists. However, even the majority of optimists anticipates some increase in ‡ood risks. Informed by these results, the
full model assumes that optimistic agents anticipate the possibility of a future ‡ood risk
increase at time T1 ; and become Bayesian learners at this time with some positive prior on
the probability that ‡ood risks have indeed risen.

Full Structural Model

This section presents the remaining structural assumptions and the solution method employed to simulate future coastal home price trajectories under competing belief, ‡ood risk,
and policy scenarios.

28

5.0.1

Flood Risk Beliefs

First, based on the survey results, we assume that both realists and optimists anticipate that
a ‡ood risk change may happen in the future. However, only realists immediately adopt the
o¢ cial forecast f s g1
s=t as their belief. We stress that this assumption is conservative in that
more rationality will generally lead us to predict less mispricing of coastal homes. That is,
relaxing assumptions of rationality and introducing some degree of optimism among realists
would only strengthen the magnitude of our predicted mispricing of coastal homes. We
therefore adopt fully informed realists as conservative benchmark assumption.
Optimists are modeled as aware but skeptical of the scienti…c forecast. Their prior beliefs
are such that they initially assign a probability 0 < qTo 1 < 1 to the possibility that ‡ood risk
will truly rise to higher level

H

at time T1 ; and believe that o¢ cial estimates are wrong

and ‡ood risk remains at the low level

L

at and after T1 with positive probability (1

qTo 1 ).

Formally, our updating framework is an adaptation from Dieckmann (2011) for the present
setting. Optimists’contemporaneous ‡ood risk beliefs at time t

o
t

= qto (

H

qto )(

) + (1

L

T1 are given by:

)

Beliefs are then updated each period based on whether or not ‡ood events occur:

While the benchmark speci…cation assumes rational Bayesian updating, we also consider a
behavioral extension introducing an overreaction parameter to better match the empirical
literature’s evidence on the speed at which, e.g., insurance demand responds to ‡ood events
(Gallagher, 2014). The results are fully robust to these alternative speci…cations. Figure

29

8 presents an example sequence of optimists’and realists’‡ood risk beliefs that change in
response to underlying risk changes as well as ‡ood events:

Next, with regards to higher order beliefs, our benchmark assumption is that realists
have rational higher order expectations of optimists’belief changes, meaning they take into
account that, in each future period t + j a ‡ood will occur with probability

r
t+j

and change

optimists’ beliefs according to (19). We stress two aspects of this assumption. First, it is
again conservative in that more rationality will generally lead us to predict less mispricing of
coastal homes. Second, this assumption does not imply that realists know optimists’future
beliefs - only that they understand optimists’updating rules. In contrast, optimists do not
anticipate the possibility of future changes in their own beliefs beyond T1 , including with
regards to their expectations of realists’ future beliefs about their (optimists’) ‡ood risk

30

perceptions. Together, the benchmark case thus implies that, for example, at t > T1 :

While contemporaneous ‡ood risk beliefs are common knowledge, agents may thus have
di¤erent expectations of how optimists’ beliefs will evolve in the future. We again stress
that these are conservative assumptions. If, instead, we assumed that realists failed to
anticipate optimists’ potential future learning about higher ‡ood risks, they would overestimate optimists’future willingness-to-pay for vulnerable properties, and thus the re-sale
price of coastal homes, further contributing to contemporaneous overvaluations.

Solving the Model

We solve for pricing dynamics through backwards iteration. At the core of our approach is
the notion that ‡ood risk valuation disagreements will not persist inde…nitely. Arguably the
most likely scenario forcing e¤ective belief convergence will be continued reform e¤orts of
the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Congress enacted NFIP in 1968 due to rising
damages from ‡ooding and limited private market insurance penetration. To this day, NFIP
remains the dominant insurer for ‡ooding in the United States, with more than …ve million
policies in force as of January 2017 covering more than $1.2 trillion of property and contents
(FEMA, 2017; Moore, 2017). NFIP is, however, considered to be …scally unsustainable and
has been labeled as a "high risk" program due its failure to charge actuarially fair rates
for many of its policies (GAO, 2017). One in …ve policies has traditionally been o¢ cially
subsidized, charging less than half of full risk levels on average (CBO, 2014). The extent
to which even full risk rates are actuarially fair is moreover an open question (CBO, 2014).
The Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 sought to bring the program closer

31

into …scal balance through insurance subsidy phase-outs and immediate price increases for
lapsed or new policies, including those for newly sold properties which would be charged
o¢ cial full risk rates (FEMA, 2013). However, due to concerns over homeowner impacts,
the Homeowner Flood Insurance A¤ordability Act of 2014 partially repealed and modi…ed
Biggert-Waters.19 Looking toward the future, however, a move towards real risk rates and
more strictly enforced insurance mandates is highly likely.
In theory, a fully enforced ‡ood insurance requirement at actuarially fair rates would force
all agents - regardless of personal beliefs - to internalize the true ‡ood risk. In the context of
our model with linear utility, policy reform mandating real risk-rate ‡ood insurance is thus
equivalent to a convergence of (e¤ective) ‡ood risk beliefs towards their true value

:20 We

thus formally assume that, at some future time T; e¤ective ‡ood risk beliefs will become

Speci…cally, the HFIAA impacts policyholders heterogeneously, by lowering the rate of future premium
increases for some, eliminating rate increases for others, and providing premium refunds to a subset
who paid the full risk rate on new insurance purchases (FEMA, 2014).
Alternatively, one might also argue that, in the very long run, ‡ood risk beliefs must converge as sea
levels continue to rise to the point of making annual ‡ood risks undeniable (approaching unity as sea
levels rise to reach current coastal properties’elevation). While we focus our analysis on medium-run
‡ood risk increases, we note that, in the very long run, beliefs will almost surely converge even in the
absence of policy reform.

On the one hand, accounting for dynamic belief heterogeneity in a non-stationary setting thus
clearly introduces a curse of dimensionality which limits our ability to consider a richer set of
belief types.21 On the other hand, however, (26) enables us to compute proper equilibrium
price dynamics while ‡exibly accounting for di¤erent belief and policy reform structures, in
a setting that strictly generalizes the benchmark homogeneous beliefs framework.
5.0.3

Policy Reform Beliefs

The last structural element is to specify agents’beliefs about enforced policy rates (or commonly held long-run beliefs) after time T ,

For optimists, we consider beliefs in the range of their own and realists’‡ood risk beliefs:

Eto [

2 [Eto [

(27)

with a benchmark assumption that optimists believe that enforced rates after time T will
correspond to the population-weighted average of beliefs at the time:

Eto [

= ( o )Eto [

(28)

Intuitively, the two extremes nested by (27) can be thought of as follows. On the one
hand, if Eto [

T]

= Eto [

o
T ];

this means that optimists believe that everyone will eventually

agree with them, or, equivalently, that the government will o¤er and require cheap ‡ood
insurance at a risk rate corresponding to optimists’ beliefs. Naturally, these beliefs boost
optimists’valuation of coastal properties. In contrast, if Eto [

T]

= Eto [

r
T]

this means that

optimists anticipate that they will eventually be forced to purchase ‡ood insurance at risk
rates corresponding to realists’ beliefs. However, the implications of this assumption are
arguably at odds with the empirical evidence on the impacts of changes in ‡ood insurance
requirements (e.g., Gibson, Mullins, Hill, 2017). Consequently, our benchmark scenario
assumes (28), though we assess robustness to the range of (27) in Section (6:3).

5.1.1

Model Calibration
Flood Risks

Coastal ‡ood risk is broadly determined by two main channels: (1) by the sea level, which is
projected to increase in the coming decades, thereby increasing ‡ood risk through high tide
36

impacts (Rahmstorf, 2007), and (2) by extreme event surges such as tropical cyclones and
other storms (Emanuel, Sundararajan, and Williams, 2008; Knutson et al, 2010). We utilize
future sea level rise projections for Newport, RI, from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE, 2017) and NOAA (Blank, Lubchenco, and Dietrick, 2012). In order to translate
sea level rise to coastal inundation probabilities, we further utilize STORMTOOLS, a set of
Rhode Island inundation maps and ‡ood return rates under various projections of sea level
rise developed by partners including the University of Rhode Island and NOAA (SAMP,
2017).22 We use these estimates to project both current and future annual ‡ood risks for
each of the coastal homes in our sample. Figure 9 below presents the resulting distribution,
which shifts right as sea levels rise, re‡ecting the increased probability of inundation. The
average property in our sample faces a baseline annual ‡ood risk of over 7%, increasing to
15% with 1 foot of sea level rise. However, ‡ood events here are de…ned as the water level
reaching the ground height of the property structure or higher if surge occurred at high
tide, so that not all ‘‡ood events’would cause serious damage. Consequently, we use more
conservative ‡ood risk probabilities in the calibration below.
22

A full explanation of the methodology can be found at http://www.beachsamp.org/stormtools/.
While the STORMTOOLS approach is arguably the most comprehensive publicly available sea level
rise inundation layer for Rhode Island, the approach assumes additive inundation increases from sea
level rise and does not account for local ‡ood mitigation strategies that may change over time.

Calibration Summary

Based on the survey and ‡ood risk assessment, this section presents our calibration. Table
2 summarizes key parameters for the benchmark scenario.

38

Several points should be noted. First, we select the net value of living in an owner-occupied
home eh to match the 2017 median coastal home price in our setting of $410k: That is, we
begin the model simulations in today’s housing market rather than a past ‘pre-climate change
awareness’equilibrium as considered in the theoretical discussions of Section 3. Intuitively,
this is because there is no unique empirical counterpart to the theoretical device of an initial
climate change announcement. We do, however, discuss price dynamics in the context of
their full trajectory from initial to long-run fundamental values.
Second, there are at least two approaches to varying belief distributions across model
runs. Our preferred approach calibrates eh to match observed 2017 coastal home prices
conditional on the estimated benchmark share of optimists (

o

= 35%), and conducts coun-

terfactual simulations that change the optimist share while holding eh …xed. Intuitively, this
approach simulates where coastal housing prices should or would be in 2017 under alternative belief structures, holding constant their fundamental value. An alternative approach
("Alt.") is to hold the model’s predictions for the 2017 housing price …xed at $410k by
re-calibrating eh across belief scenarios. Intuitively, this approach illustrates the potential
pitfalls of interpreting today’s housing prices through the lens of a homogeneous rational
beliefs model, and thus over-estimating their fundamental value eh . Results for both are
presented below.
Next, while the calibration makes arbitrary assumptions about the number and timing
of future ‡ood events, we show later on that these do not a¤ect the main results (see Table
5), as current prices and fundamental values depend only on expectations of storm events,
not on their realizations. Other calibration notes include the following. For computational
reasons, we run the model with one period corresponding to two calendar years, and adjust
the relevant calibration parameters accordingly.23 For reasons described above, we adopt the
FEMA lower bound on ‡ood event risk of 1% as a conservative measure of baseline risk. As
for future risk, we focus on a 1 foot of sea level rise scenario based on USACE projections over

probability of 4% in order to represent the probability of a serious event. The sensitivity

a re-weighted average of the survey population to correct for over-sampling of coastal homes.

Quantitative Results
Main Results

Figure 10 presents the main results for the benchmark calibration. We run the model varying the percentage of optimists from 0% to our sample population estimate of bo = 35%:

Table 3 summarizes the results numerically. The …rst central …nding is that ‡ood risk belief
heterogeneity leads to a signi…cant overvaluation of coastal homes compared to their fundamental value (black line with stars) implied by the homogeneous rational beliefs model.
Our benchmark estimates imply that current coastal housing prices exceed fundamentals by
10%. Economically, an overvaluation of this magnitude would be highly signi…cant. For
comparison, during the Great Recession, the median U.S. home sale price decline from peak
(Q1 2007) to trough (Q1 2009) was about 19%:24
24

While prices fell over a shorter time horizon during the Great Recession, it should be noted that the
speed of the corrections in Figure 12 is a function of the assumed storm event and policy reform schedule.
Faster policy reform (or belief changes) would imply a faster price decline to fundamentals.

Figure 11 presents the main results under the alternative approach which e¤ectively views
current prices through the lenses of models with di¤erent belief assumptions. Under homogeneous rational beliefs (0% optimists), the present value of climate change impacts should
have already capitalized into home prices, leaving only a modest additional decline ( 3%)
over the next 25 years: In contrast, if 35% of the population are excessively optimistic, the
remaining coastal home price decline more than quadruples to

13%. While the total fun-

damental value loss induced by sea level rise is, of course, the same across belief scenarios,
Figure 11 highlights that we may empirically underestimate this amount if we view home
price data through the implicit lens of a rational homogeneous beliefs framework.

In sum, the results indicate that benchmark belief heterogeneity may be contributing to an
economically signi…cant overvaluation of coastal homes relative to their fundamental value,
preventing housing assets from fully re‡ecting climatic risks. Giving credibility to these
projections, our central quantitative estimate of 10% overvaluation aligns well with the
empirical …nding of Bernstein, Gustafson, and Lewis (2018) that the general owner-occupied
segment of the housing market lacks the signi…cant 7% sea level rise vulnerability discount
42

found in the sophisticated (non-owner occupied) segment. In addition to formalizing and
substantiating a mechanism accounting for this di¤erential discount, our structural model
further enables us to gauge the welfare costs of the allocative ine¢ ciency induced by belief
heterogeneity, and to simulate future coastal housing market scenarios under alternative
belief and policy scenarios. Indeed, below we present extensive sensitivity checks for the
main results, …nding them to be broadly robust, including to consideration of evidence from
a hedonic analyses speci…c to our empirical setting.

6.2

Allocative Ine¢ ciency Costs

Within the context of our framework, the only e¢ ciency cost associated with coastal home
mispricings is the allocative ine¢ ciency of realists with high amenity values being priced
out of coastal markets. In reality, coastal mispricing is likely to create welfare costs through
important additional channels. For example, if we modeled the mortgage process whereby
optimists obtain loans using coastal properties as collateral, then the devaluation of those
properties due to ‡ood events or policy changes could lead to defaults, further asset value
losses, and adverse e¤ects on credit markets (see, e.g., Geanakoplos, 2010), thereby exacerbating market incompleteness. When coastal properties constitute an important source of
local tax revenues, both ‡uctuations and permanent reductions in their value could create
additional e¢ ciency costs depending on the …scal policy response. As our model does not
incorporate these e¤ects, the e¢ ciency cost estimates represent a strictly lower bound.25
A social planner would allocate coastal homes to the optimists and realists with the k1
highest valuations, equating the marginal buyers’valuations at the optimum (

the marginal realist’s valuation exceeds that of the marginal optimist (i.e.,

25

We also acknowledge existing literature on welfare implications of belief structure. For example, Brunnermeier, Simsek, and Xiong (2014) develop a welfare criterion, belief-neutral e¢ ciency, in cases where
beliefs are distorted and heterogeneous. However, a key di¤erence from our work is that the future
probabilities across the ‡ood outcome are scienti…cally estimable rather than unknown.

As the ‡ood risk increases and beliefs start to diverge, an increasing number of realists are
projected to move out of coastal markets. This prediction is in line both with our survey
…nding that coastal residents who are more concerned about ‡ooding are also signi…cantly
more likely to intend to sell their homes within the next …ve years (Figure 5), and with
BGL’s empirical result that transaction volumes of vulnerable homes increased after the
44

release of worsening sea level rise projections. In our model, the …rst realists to move are
the ones with relatively lower amenity values for coastal living, so that the remaining coastal
realists’amenity values increase (blue line with circles). In turn, the departing realists are
replaced by optimists with lower amenity values (pink line with diamonds). Only once the
policy reform at time T enforces the internalization of real risk rates do prices adjust so that
realists return to coastal housing markets, restoring allocative e¢ ciency.
Table 4 summarizes the allocative ine¢ ciency costs in our target housing market on a per
household basis, computed speci…cally as the present value of the ‡ow costs (29) across the
study period until policy reform. The benchmark costs are estimated at $685 per household
($2017) - a modest amount, although it should be noted that this is the average net cost
across all households, not just those relocated due to belief heterogeneity. For the whole
of Bristol County, RI, the projected welfare costs thus amount to around $13.2 million.
Alternative assumptions for the maximum coastal amenity value ( ) - set at either our
hedonic regression estimate ($4:9k=yr; see Section 6:3), or at the 75th percentile of coastal
residents in our survey ($8:5k=yr) - do not materially a¤ect this estimate due to the fact
that higher losses for realists are partly o¤set by higher gains for optimists. In contrast, the
share of coastal homes (k1 ) naturally has a large e¤ect on the allocative ine¢ ciency. Finally,
enacting ‡ood insurance reform sooner than in the benchmark (2033 vs. 2043) naturally
reduces the allocative ine¢ ciency as well.

Robustness and Extensions

This section presents a robustness analysis for the benchmark model. We …rst consider
alternative ‡ood risk scenarios. Figure 13 plots the projected evolution of coastal home
prices for ‡ood risk increases from 1% to 2%, 4% (benchmark), and 6% per year, comparing
the homogeneous rational scenario with the benchmark optimist share of 35% in each case.
Table 5 summarizes all sensitivity analysis results numerically. The extent to which current
coastal housing prices are estimated to exceed fundamentals rises along with the future ‡ood
risk increase, up to 20% in the high risk scenario.

Our second sensitivity check introduces alternative assumptions for optimists’beliefs about
the long-run risk rates enforced by policy as per (27). The results indicate that even optimists’ beliefs about very long-run ‡ood insurance policy changes can signi…cantly a¤ect
coastal housing prices in the present. Expectations of long-run availability of cheap insurance can greatly in‡ate property prices relative to their fundamental value, leading to an
46

estimated overvaluation of 25%. In contrast, if optimists expect to be forced to pay o¢ cial
risk rates eventually, overvaluation is signi…cantly mitigated (2%).
Third, we consider sensitivity to a behavioral modi…cation that allows optimists to "overreact" to ‡ood events or the lack thereof. The motivation for this extension is that several
empirical studies have found home prices and ‡ood insurance demand to revert to baseline within only 5-10 years after ‡ood events (Bin and Landry, 2013; Gallagher, 2014), a
pace not matched by the baseline Bayesian framework. We thus incorporate an overreaction
parameter

into agents’updating rules as follows:26

Even a modest degree of overreaction (

(

H

L)

= 10%) turns out to be su¢ cient for beliefs to

revert back to baseline at a rate in line with these empirical studies (see Appendix Figure
A2). While this overreaction increases the volatility of future coastal housing prices compared
to rational Bayesian updating, it does not a¤ect the estimated overvaluation or overall price
decline levels, as shown in Table 5.
Another assumption which turns out not to a¤ect the estimated level of coastal home price
overvaluation is the number and timing of future ‡ood events. Intuitively, this is because
both the initial price and fundamental value depend only on expectations over ‡ood events.
The volatility of prices in the process of correcting to fundamentals does, however, depend
on storm realizations, as they determine accumulated learning by the time policy reform
is enacted. We also study sensitivity to the assumed timing of ‡ood policy reform itself,
which highlights an intuitive trade o¤: while faster reform could cut allocative ine¢ ciency
26

Gallagher (2014) formally compares the rational Bayesian model to a modi…cation with a discounting
parameter that weights older ‡ood events less in agents’ updating rules. Our model is not strictly
comparable both as he focuses on a Beta-Bernoulli model and because we focus on learning in the
context of changing ‡ood risk and sea level rise. We therefore consider (30) as an analogous modi…ed
updating rule to match the empirical evidence.

costs in half (Table 4), it would also triple price volatility by enforcing a correction over
a shorter time horizon. Table 5 presents two further sensitivity checks. One, we vary the
share of coastal housing above and below the benchmark value of k1 = 13:4%; with and
without a re-scaling of the ‡ow value of home living to match the initial observed median
coastal housing price of $410k: Two, we vary the utility discount factor above and below the
benchmark value of

range across these simulations.
Finally, we consider an additional extension of the model to account for the possibility
that coastal residents change their ‡ood risk beliefs di¤erentially after moving to the coast in
order to rationalize their sorting choice ex-post. Details are presented in the Appendix. We
argue that ex-post rationalization should not fundamentally alter the main results as long
as there are optimistic agents among the potential marginal buyers of coastal homes, as is
consistent with the survey results. That is, while ex-post rationalization may create a class
of ‘entrenched’coastal residents (who are less likely to become marginal sellers), mispricing
48

eh

of coastal homes that are being sold (e.g., by informed agents) will continue as long as there
are optimists among the marginal buyers. The survey results suggest this to be the case:
30% of (currently) non-coastal residents in our sample are optimistic about coastal ‡ood
risks, and recent movers (who relocated from another town to their survey area within the
past 3 years) show a similar spread in the ‡ood belief distribution to the full sample.

Hedonic Estimation

This study relies in part on evidence from stated preference elicitation, a methodology with
known shortcomings. For comparison, we thus present results from a hedonic analysis of
housing prices in our empirical setting. We collect home sales transactions and characteristics
data for Bristol County and North Smith…eld, Rhode Island, from Tax Assessor records and
merge these with a spatial layer to identify homes that are within 400 feet of the waterfront
as well as in o¢ cial NFIP-designated ‡ood zones. The Appendix provides details on the
data and estimation.
6.4.1

Coastal Amenity Value

We …rst consider robustness in our estimated coastal amenity value. The survey methodology enables us to ask respondents speci…cally about their valuation of the coastal amenity
holding ‡ood risk and other confounders constant. In contrast, hedonic regression can provide revealed preference estimates, but typically cannot cleanly disentangle the di¤erent
components entering the observed coastal home price premium, as shown in Section 3. The
estimated coastal home premium is around +23% and generally precisely estimated, as shown
in Table A2. Given the median coastal home price in the data ($424k), at a real interest
rate of 5%, this estimate corresponds to an annual coastal value of $4,876. For comparison,
the survey results imply an annualized average coastal value of $6,720 for the median coastal
home price in our sample ($410). While these …gures are not strictly comparable, we cannot
disentangle how much of the gap is due to structural di¤erences (e.g., marginal versus av49

erage coastal buyer valuation) versus methodological biases in stated preference elicitation
(e.g., hypothetical bias). We address this concern through a sensitivity check replacing the
survey-based estimate of

in the model with the hedonic regression results. The results

(Table 6) reveal that the extent of overvaluation is either larger (17%) or unchanged (10%)
depending on whether the ‡ow value of housing is re-scaled to match the initial coastal home
price in the data.27

Flood Risk Capitalization

The second use of the hedonic analysis is to provide direct empirical evidence on the capitalization of ‡ood risks in our empirical setting, connecting back to the basic question of
whether housing price data support the use of a heterogeneous agent model as developed
in this paper. First, we fail to detect a signi…cant negative e¤ect of FEMA ‡ood zone status on housing prices (while controlling for close proximity to the coast), in line with both
a number of other empirical studies and the models’ predictions, as described in Sections
2 and 3: Second, the time horizon of our data enables us to gauge changes in the ‡ood
risk premium over time. As described in Section 3; the homogeneous rational beliefs model
would predict that the announcement of climate change should have lead to an immediate
(absolute value) increase in the ‡ood risk penalty, followed by a continual increase as sea
level rise draws nearer. Bernstein, Gustafson, and Lewis (2018) fail to detect such a decline
27

A ceteris paribus decrease in the maximum coastal amenity value (from the benchmark to the hedonic
results) lowers the predicted 2017 coastal home price from $410k to $206k, so that a given overvaluation
amount appears as a larger percentage of the initial price. Re-scaling the ‡ow home ownership value eh
to once again match the initial coastal home price of $410 returns the overvaluation to the benchmark
magnitude of 10%.

We fail to detect the pattern predicted by the homogeneous rational beliefs model in our
setting.28 Of course, these estimates are subject to numerous caveats both conceptually
(see Section 3) and econometrically (see Appendix), and provide only suggestive evidence.
Nonetheless, they are in line with both the varied …ndings of the empirical literature and
the results of the model, which indicate that belief heterogeneity may be a critical factor
preventing asset prices from accurately re‡ecting climatic risks in housing markets.
28

In line with BGL, we do …nd that the ‡ood risk premium appears to be more negative post-2014
compared to the 2005-2014 time period but that these di¤erences are imprecisely estimated in the
general sample dominated by owner-occupied housing. We also …nd that, over the longer time horizon
in our sample, the current ‡ood risk premium appears to be less negative than in the more distant past.

Conclusion

To what extent do asset prices re‡ect climatic risks? This issue is of growing interest due not
only to its policy importance (Anderson et al., 2018), but also as it speaks to the fundamental
question of the empirical determinants of asset prices. Flooding has long been one of the
costliest natural disasters in the United States (NOAA, 2017a), and risks are set to increase
as sea levels rise over the coming decades. At the same time, however, a rich empirical
literature has documented that capitalization of these risks into housing prices is often weak
and variable across housing markets and segments (e.g., Bernstein, Gustafson, Lewis, 2018).
This paper has explored the role of ‡ood risk belief heterogeneity in accounting for these
present and potential future pricing dynamics in coastal U.S. housing markets. We provide
both theoretical and empirical evidence through the combination of (i) a dynamic housing
market model allowing for heterogeneity in home types, consumer preferences, and ‡ood risk
beliefs, (ii) a …eld survey campaign eliciting belief distributions among waterfront and inland
residents of coastal communities in Rhode Island, and (iii) supplementary evidence from both
the prior empirical literature and a hedonic analysis of housing prices in our sample setting.
The main results are threefold. First, we …nd that allowing for belief heterogeneity
enables our model to reconcile the mixed empirical evidence on ‡ood risk penalties as driven
by sorting and di¤erent resulting equilibria across markets that may vary in the distributions
of beliefs and housing stock attributes.
Second, consistent with these theoretical predictions, the survey results indicate that
coastal ‡ood zone residents have both signi…cantly lower ‡ood risk perceptions and higher
waterfront amenity valuations than their inland counterparts. Close to 40% of ‡ood zone
residents indicate that they are "not at all" worried about ‡ooding over the next decade.
This lower degree of ‡ood worry does not appear to be driven by di¤erent beliefs about ‡ood
damages, insurance payouts, or post disaster public aid.
Third, calibrating the model to these survey results and ‡ood risk projections under sea
level rise, we estimate that coastal housing prices exceed fundamentals by 10% in our setting.
52

We moreover …nd that viewing current housing prices through the lens of a homogeneous
rational beliefs framework may lead modelers to underestimate the outstanding coastal home
price declines over the next 25 years by a factor of four. These results are robust to a range
of robustness checks, but sensitive to the extent of future ‡ood risk increases and households’long-run ‡ood policy beliefs, highlighting the potential power of policy expectations
to mitigate - or exacerbate - current ine¢ ciencies. While our model can only capture welfare
e¤ects in the form of allocative ine¢ ciency, devaluations in at-risk markets may also be a
signi…cant policy concern due to their potential e¤ects on mortgage and credit markets. A
formalizations and quanti…cation of these impact mechanism would arguably be a highly
interesting topic for future work.
While our analysis focuses on Rhode Island, coastal ‡ood risks a¤ect large areas of the
United States. Neumann et al. (2000) estimate that three feet of sea level rise - a plausible scenario by the end of the century (Melillo et al., 2014) - would result in substantial
inundations plus a 7,000 square mile (38%) increase in U.S. ‡ood zones. At the same time,
household beliefs about these changes remain strongly heterogeneous, with 60% of respondents in a recent national survey indicating that they do not believe rising sea levels to be a
‘very likely’consequence of climate change (Pew, 2016). The results of this paper highlight
the potential of these beliefs to inhibit the e¢ cient pricing of climate risks into housing assets,
and the importance of accurate ‡ood risk information and policy in ensuring the e¢ ciency
and stability of coastal housing markets moving forward.

Ex-Post Rationalization vs. Ex-Ante Belief Heterogeneity

Our main analysis assumes that households’ ‡ood risk perceptions evolve principally
based on the realization of ‡ood events, or the lack thereof. One potential concern with
interpreting observed ‡ood risk belief heterogeneity in this way is that coastal residents could
60

also be changing their beliefs di¤erentially after moving to the coast in order to rationalize
their sorting choice ex-post. This section presents an illustrative extension of the model to
showcase the potential e¤ects of ex-post rationalization. For ease of illustration, assume that
the world starts in a neutral state where nobody has yet purchased or rented a home, and
all optimists o initially have common ‡ood risk belief

o
0.

The initial sorting in period 0 is

thus the same as in the benchmark model.
We focus on the most interesting and empirically relevant case where both optimists and
realists are initially in the coastal home market. In period 0, the market-clearing coastal
home price P0 equates both the marginal optimist’s and realist’s willingness to pay:
P0 = (eh +

r
0

r

+ E0r [P1 ]) = (eh +

o
0

o
0

+ E0o [P1 ])

(31)

If no storm occurs in period 0, both coastal and non-coastal Bayesian learners update their
‡ood risk beliefs downward. Importantly, however, coastal residents may further change
their beliefs di¤erentially in response to having moved to the coast (ex-post rationalization).
Speci…cally, let

o;C0;1
1

denote the period 1 ‡ood risk belief of optimists that lived on the
o;N C0;1
1

coast from period 0 to 1 (C0;1 ), and

analogously for optimists who did not live on

the coast (N C0;1 ). Beliefs evolve according to:

+Rationalization

Beliefs (32) imply the following changes. First, the coastal home price valuation of optimists already living on the coast has increased more than other agents’, indicating that they
will retain the highest willingness to pay and remain in their coastal homes. Consequently,
measure

o

(

o

0)

of coastal homes remains occupied by their initial optimist residents.

Second, the period 0 marginal optimist’s contemporaneous coastal home price valuation has
increased, i.e.: [

o
0

o;N C0;1
1

]>[

o
0

o
0

]. In contrast, the marginal realist’s contempora-

61

neous valuation remains unchanged (

including the extent to which each type of agent is aware of ex-post rationalization e¤ects,
how it colors their beliefs about others’beliefs, etc., a plausible scenario - in line with the
structure of the baseline model - is that optimists’future price expectations at time 1 increase
at least weakly more than realists’ future price expectations in response to their updated

beliefs (32): E1

E1r [P2m2 ]

expect the period 1 equilibrium to unfold as follows: some measure of non-coastal optimists’
valuations now exceed those of coastal resident realists, leading the former to buy coastal
homes from the latter: Importantly, the marginal buyers are now the previously non-coastal
optimists, whereas the marginal sellers are the realists.29 The equilibrium coastal home price
in period 1 is thus determined by the interaction between these groups. More formally:

(33)

With ex-post rationalization (or di¤erential updating), the model thus predicts that long
term coastal residents’ valuations of their homes will exceed the market price of coastal
homes being sold. However, as long as there are marginal buyers of coastal homes that hold
inaccurate ‡ood risk beliefs

o;N C0;1
;
1

the potential for mispricing remains robust.

Empirically, the key implication of (33) is that optimistic beliefs should be calibrated
based on a sample representing marginal buyers, which may not correspond to the full
sample. That is, if (long-term) coastal residents are more optimistic about ‡ood risks than
the marginal Bayesians whose beliefs pin down prices, we might be concerned that combining
29

In the aftermath of a storm, coastal optimists could become marginal sellers as well, depending on how
they update their beliefs.

62

survey responses from all residents leads to an overestimate of optimism compared to the
relevant population. As noted in the main text, our survey results suggest that 30% of
currently non-coastal residents are optimistic about coastal ‡ood risks. We also …nd that
new movers - de…ned as agents who moved from another town to their survey area within the
past 3 years from other towns - exhibit a similar distribution including ‡ood risk optimism,
as shown in Figure A3. While the moving history questions were added to the survey late,
thus limiting the sample size underlying Figure A3 to n = 26; the concept of out-of-town
movers as having a ‘fresh’distribution of ‡ood risk beliefs is common in the literature (see,
e.g., discussions in Gallagher, 2014).

In sum, the potential marginal buyers for coastal properties thus appear likely to underestimate ‡ood risks in our sample and empirical setting, regardless of whether beliefs of
established coastal residents are additionally a¤ected by ex-post rationalization.

Empirical Comparison: Hedonic Estimation

This section describes the dataset and estimation for Section 6:3. We scrape property data
for the Rhode Island Bristol County towns of Barrington, Warren, and Bristol from Tax
Assessor’s records, including transactions histories and property characteristics from 2017.
In addition, to allay concerns that potential homebuyers view Bristol County as a housing
market, and therefore our control group of non-‡ood zone homes could be impacted through
spillovers in housing market interactions, we also collect data for all of North Smith…eld,
Rhode Island, given that it has similar sociodemographic characteristics and proximity to
Providence as Bristol Country. We locate buildings within a property using a GIS layer
of all structures in Rhode Island originally compiled by the Rhode Island E-911 Uniform
Emergency Telephone System and redistributed by the Rhode Island Geographic Information System (RIGIS, 2017). This layer geolocates all known structures in Rhode Island to the
latitude and longitude of the center of the building. We obtain o¢ cial ‡ood map information from FEMA’s Map Services Center and older ‡ood maps from RIGIS. Finally, to map
shorelines, we obtain the Rhode Island Continually Updated Shoreline Product from RIGIS
(RIGIS, 2016). We add a 400 foot bu¤er to the shoreline in order to select coastal properties. In addition, we obtain the spatial extent of Superstorm Sandy surge inundation from
STORMTOOLS (SAMP, 2017). We match individual property structures to their ‡ood zone,
coastal/non-coastal designation, and Sandy inundation status. We then match properties
with Tax Assessor data including building structure information and the history of property
transactions including sales price (which we in‡ation-adjust to 2015 $USD using the BLS
Consumer Price Index) and deed type. In order to control for potentially confounding ‡ood
policy events, we also categorize property sales as before or after: the Biggert-Waters Act
passage (July 6, 2012), the Homeowner Flood Insurance A¤ordability Act passage (March
21, 2014) and introduction (October 29, 2013).
We trim our transactions data to exclude the bottom and top 1% of annualized price
changes between sales, and, for the recent analysis (2010-2016), observations for which the
64

sales price is more than 50% below the 2017 tax assessor value, in order to remove non-arm’s
length deals. We also trim non-standard properties in terms of bedrooms (those with more
than 10 bedrooms) and bathrooms so as to exclude apartment buildings, nursing homes, etc.
We also drop observations where multiple deeds are recorded with di¤erent sales prices on
the same date. Finally, we also consider a restriction to "Warranty" deed types, omitting
deeds such as Quit Claims more likely to be associated with non-market sales.
We conduct two estimation exercises. The …rst focuses on recent post-crisis years (20102014) since several important variables are only available for the past decade or 2017 (e.g.,
property characteristics, tax assessor values, active ‡ood maps, etc.). The second focuses on
a longer time horizon (1970-2017) but has to use a …xed e¤ects speci…cation and is subject
to more measurement error, as described below.
First, we estimate the following speci…cation for 2010-2014:

lnPit =

i Xi

+ ci +

1 fi

2 BWit

3 fi

(34)

Here, we regress the log of house sales price (2015 $USD) on a vector of home characteristics (Xi ), an indicator for a coastal home (within 400 feet of the coastline; ci ), an indicator
for being in a ‡ood zone (fi ), an indicator for a house sold after the passage of the BiggertWaters Act (and before its partial repeal in 2014; BWit ), the interaction between the ‡ood
zone and Biggert-Waters status (fi

BWit ), as well as Census tract …xed e¤ects ( c ) and

year …xed e¤ects (dY t ). The …rst column presents results including property sales between
2010 and 2017 that were not directly impacted by Sandy and whose ‡ood designation did
not change over the time period. Columns (3)-(4) and (5) further restrict the sample to the
time before the HFIAA was passed and introduced, respectively.

Our second speci…cation seeks to gauge changes in the ‡ood zone premium over a longer
time horizon (1970-2017). Here, we utilize a …xed e¤ects speci…cation (since we do not

over time to identify the treatment e¤ects of interest.30 We also restrict the speci…cation to

A remaining identi…cation concern would be if ‡ood zone properties are di¤erentially likely to receive
renovations than non-‡ood zone properties, which could bias our estimated ‡ood zone coe¢ cient trend
downward (to be more negative over time). Since our central …nding is the absence of such a downward
trend, however, this potential source of bias is not a concern for spuriously driving our result. It should
be noted that McCoy and Zhao (2018) …nd a positive e¤ect of Hurricane Sandy on investment rates at
damaged buildings inside but not outside the ‡ood zone in New York City. Column (2) thus excludes all
properties damaged by Hurricane Sandy to avoid this potential confounder in damage repairs. We also
note that other time periods with large statewide ‡ood events (e.g., 1980-85) we …nd di¤erentially more
negative ‡ood risk premia, suggesting that di¤erentially positive investment in ‡ood zones is unlikely
