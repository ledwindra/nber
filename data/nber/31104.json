    "abstract": "\n\nWhile carbon pricing, in general, and carbon taxes, in particular, are popular with economists, they are subject to considerable misunderstanding among policy makers and the public.  In this paper I consider and refute five myths about carbon taxes:  1) that a carbon price will hurt economic growth; 2) that carbon pricing will kill jobs; 3) that a carbon tax and cap and trade program have the same economic impacts; 4) that we can\u2019t achieve carbon reduction targets with a carbon tax; and 5) that carbon pricing is regressive.  I then discuss implications for policy making.\n\n",
