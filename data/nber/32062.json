    "abstract": "\n\nInterpreting individual heterogeneity in terms of probability theory has proved powerful in connecting behaviour at the individual and aggregate levels.  Returning to Ricardo's focus on comparative efficiency as a basis for international trade, much recent quantitative equilibrium modeling of the global economy builds on particular probabilistic assumptions about technology.   We review these assumptions and how they deliver a unified framework underlying a wide range of static and dynamic equilibrium models.\n\n",
