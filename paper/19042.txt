Aggregation and The Estimated Effects of Local Economic Conditions on Health

JEL No. E32,I10,J20
ABSTRACT
This paper considers the relationship between local economic conditions and health with a focus on
different approaches to geographic aggregation. After reviewing the tradeoffs associated with moreand less-disaggregated analyses–including an investigation of the migratory response to changing
economic conditions–I update earlier state-level analyses of mortality and infant health and then consider
how the estimated effects vary when the analysis is conducted at differing levels of geographic aggregation.
This analysis reveals that more-disaggregated analyses severely understate the extent to which downturns
are associated with improved health. Further investigation reveals that county economic conditions
have an independent effect on mortality but that state and regional economic conditions are stronger
predictors. I also leverage county-level data to explore heterogeneity in the link between county economic
conditions and health across states, demonstrating that local downturns lead to the greatest improvements
in health in low-income states.

Introduction
Although Harvey Brenner’s pioneering research suggested that health deteriorates during

recessions (1973, 1975, 1979), follow-up work has revealed that estimates based on aggregate
time-series data are quite fragile (Forbes and McGregor 1984; McAvinchey 1988; Joyce and
Mocan 1993; Laporte 2004; Gerdtham and Johannesson 2005). As Ruhm (2000) points out,
this “fragility is not surprising since any lengthy time-series is likely to suffer from substantial
omitted variables bias.”1 In order to overcome such biases, researchers have since focused on
panel approaches that exploit local variation in economic conditions. Specifically, this “area
approach” estimates how an area’s health changes over and above changes occurring across all
areas when its economic conditions change over and above changes occurring across all areas
and routinely reveals that health improves during recessions. With few exceptions, nearly all
such studies using US data define “area” as a state.2 Should we prefer estimates that use
state-level data to estimates that use finer or broader definitions of area?
There are several tradeoffs to consider when choosing the level of geographic aggregation.
First, a more-disaggregated approach allows one to explore heterogeneity more fully. For example, we may wish to know whether local economic conditions are more-strongly related to
health for those who live in New York or for those who live in Louisiana. Since a time-series
analysis of each state is unlikely to be very compelling for the reasons described above, we can
only answer this question in a convincing fashion by disaggregating the data to a finer level
so that the area approach can be applied to each state. In addition, more-disaggregated data
makes it possible to separately identify the effects of local versus broader economic conditions.
Another benefit to taking a more-disaggregated approach is that it can improve power.
In particular, it can leverage variation in economic conditions that may be masked in moreaggregate measures as contractions in some areas are offset by expansions in others.
At the same time, it is important to keep in mind that economic indicators are subject to
measurement error, which is especially problematic for fixed-effects estimators (Griliches 1977;
Griliches and Hausman 1986). The most common measure of economic conditions used in
this literature is the unemployment rate, produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).
1

For example, it is problematic for this approach that penicillin became increasingly available as the United
States began to recover from the Great Depression.
2
To my knowledge, the only exceptions are Currie and Tekin (2011) who consider foreclosures at the zip-code
level in four states and Dehejia and Lleras-Muney (2004) who consider unemployment rates and supplement their
state-level analysis with a county-level analysis of California.

1

However, as one considers smaller areas, one needs to be more and more concerned about
measurement error in unemployment rates since they are based in part on household surveys
(Bartik 1996; Hoynes 2000).3 For this reason, employment-to-population ratios are preferable
because they are based solely on administrative data. Still, one may have concerns about
measurement-error bias that may be influenced by the level of aggregation.
It is also important to consider the fact that migration is influenced by economic conditions (Blanchard and Katz 1992; Saks and Wozniak 2011), particularly among highly-educated
individuals (Bound and Holzer 2000; Glaeser and Gyourko 2005; Wozniak 2010; Notowidigdo
2011). This heterogeneity implies that the estimated improvements in health associated with
recessions will understate the true improvements in health if standard demographic controls do
not fully capture these sorts of compositional changes. That said, it is unknown whether education and other characteristics associated with health are more- or less-strongly related to the
unemployment-migration relationship when one considers different types of moves and different
definitions of local economic conditions. As such, it is unclear whether this sort of composition
bias is likely to be of greater or lesser concern for more-disaggregated analyses.4
Given the complexity of these issues, I take as my starting point that it is not at all clear
what level of geographic aggregation is preferred but that the tradeoffs deserve consideration
and that much can be learned by comparing the results of alternative approaches. As such,
after briefly reviewing the related literature (Section 2), I describe the different ways that
I define areas throughout the subsequent sections (Section 3). I then explore the extent to
which the migratory response to changes in economic conditions differs across socioeconomic
status and different approaches to defining areas using restricted-use data from the Panel Study
of Income Dynamics (Section 4). Next I replicate and update earlier state-level estimates of
the relationship between economic conditions and mortality (Ruhm 2000 and Stevens et al.
2011) and the relationship between economic conditions at the time of conception and infant
health (Dehejia and Lleras-Muney 2004) before considering how estimated effects vary when
the analysis is conducted at differing levels of geographic aggregation (sections 5 and 6). I
3

Angrist and Krueger (1999) provide intuition: “errors tend to average out in aggregate data.” Another
problematic aspect of unemployment rate data is that the BLS’s substate estimates prior to 1990 are no longer
considered “official BLS data” because they have not been revised to be consistent with the BLS’s current
estimation procedure.
4
The systematic outmigration that occurs when an area’s unemployment rises also highlights the importance of
well-measured population denominators in calculating mortality rates—population measures that do not account
for the systematic outmigration caused by economic downturns will lead to mechanical reductions in mortality
rates.

then leverage county-level data to gain additional insights into the economic-conditions-health
relationship by simultaneously estimating the effects of county, state, and regional economic
conditions; by obtaining separate estimates of the effects of county economic conditions for
each state; and by exploring whether heterogeneous effects on health outcomes across states
can be explained by state characteristics (Section 7).
My main findings are as follows:
1. High school graduates and those with relatively-high permanent incomes are disproportionately likely to leave an area in response to a local downturn—there is not strong
evidence that this empirical regularity differs across different definitions of areas.
2. The estimated link between economic conditions and adult mortality is highly sensitive to
the level of geographic aggregation, with more-disaggregated analyses routinely producing
estimates that are smaller in magnitude. Estimates that simultaneously consider the
effects of county, state, and regional economic conditions suggest that this is because
broader measures of economic conditions are stronger predictors of health outcomes.
3. State-specific estimates based on county-level data reveal that local downturns cause mortality to fall across a majority of the United States, but that there is substantial heterogeneity. Moreover, local downturns appear to lead to the greatest improvements in health
in low-income states.

Related Literature
Studies exploring the relationship between economic conditions and health tend to fall into

one of two categories: those that focus on the effects of the specific economic circumstances
that an individual faces (income, employment status, etc.) and those that focus on the effects
of (usually local) macroeconomic conditions. One of the somewhat-puzzling aspects of this
broad and extensive literature is that job loss leads to poorer health among those losing their
jobs and their families (Sullivan and von Wachter 2009; Kuhn, Lalive, and Zwelmuller 2009;
Eliason and Storie 2009a, 2009b; Lindo 2011; Black, Devereux, and Salvanes 2012) while health
improves during recessions in developed countries (Ruhm 2000, 2003, 2005, 2007; Dehejia and
Lleras-Muney 2004; Johansson 2004; Neumayer 2004; Tapia Granados 2005; Gerdtham and
Ruhm 2006; Lin 2009; Miller et al. 2009; Stevens et al. 2011).

While many authors note that these two results are not necessarily contradictory, it has
yet to be demonstrated precisely why and how they co-exist, and what that implies for our
understanding of broader questions regarding employment and health. Nonetheless, this context is important for the interpretation of the results that follow. In particular, in order to
reconcile these two strands of literature, it must be the case that macroeconomic conditions affect health through mechanisms besides one’s own employment status. For example, they may
affect an individual’s health via impacts on pollution (Chay and Greenstone 2003), the quality
of care (Stevens et al. 2011), traffic congestion, uncertainty about one’s future employment, the
availability of overtime, etc.

Defining Areas
Throughout my analyses, I separately identify the effects of unemployment using data at five

different levels of geographic aggregation, from counties to regions. Except where replicating
earlier research, all of my analyses are based on data that are available at the county level to
ensure that all estimates are based on the same underlying sample. In particular, I do not
use data from: Alaska or Hawaii where county population data (described in greater detail
below) are unavailable prior to 1990; counties without at least one person of each age (0–85) in
1990 so that age-adjusted mortality rates can be calculated at the county level; Virginia where
there have been substantial changes to county definitions over time; the Great Lakes region in
1976 where BLS data for Illinois counties are unavailable; or the Southeast region in 2005 and
2006 where BLS data for several Louisiana counties are unavailable.5 Section 5 demonstrates
the trivial impact these sample restrictions have on the estimated effects of unemployment on
health.
My most-aggregated analyses use region-level data based on the eight regions defined by the
Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA): New England, Mideast, Great Lakes, Plains, Southeast,
Southwest, the Rocky Mountain, and Far West.6 These BEA regions were developed in the
5

In an additional an additional effort to achieve consistency in the data over time, for all years I combine the
counties of La Paz and Yuma (Arizona) which split in 1983; Washabaugh and Jackson (South Dakota) which
merged in 1983; and Adams, Boulder, Jefferson, and Weld (Colorado) from which Broomfield split off in 2001.

The state groupings are as follows. New England: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
Rhode Island, Vermont. Mideast: Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania. Great Lakes: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin. Plains: Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri,
Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota. Southeast: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia. Southwest: Arizona, New
Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas. Rocky Mountain: Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Utah, Wyoming. Far West: Alaska,
California, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Washington.

1950s with the intention of grouping states with similar economic economic and social factors.7
My next most-aggregated analyses use state-level data, followed by analyses that use data
at the BEA-Economic-Area level. The mapping of counties to BEA Economic Areas is depicted
in Figure 1. Johnson and Kort (2004), who provide a detailed account of the BEA’s procedure,
describe the 179 BEA Economic Areas as follows:
“[They] define the relevant regional markets surrounding metropolitan or micropolitan statistical areas. They consist of one or more economic nodes—metropolitan or
micropolitan statistical areas that serve as regional centers of economic activity—
and the surrounding counties that are economically related to the nodes. These
economic areas represent the relevant regional markets for labor, products, and information. They are mainly determined by labor commuting patterns [based on the
decennial census] that delineate local labor markets and that also serve as proxies
for local markets where businesses in the areas sell their products. In less populated parts of the country, newspaper readership data are also used to measure the
relevant regional markets.”
I also conduct analyses using data at the BEA-Component-Economic-Areas level. Component Economic Areas are much the same as Economic Areas except they can be based on fewer
counties and fewer residents.8 Last, as mentioned above, I conduct analyses based on data at
the county level. Naturally, the sample restrictions described above reduce the number of states,
Economic Areas, Component Economic Areas, and counties below the number that exist.

Economic Conditions, Migration, and Socioeconomic Status
In this section, I explore how the migratory response to economic conditions varies across

socioeconomic status. This analysis is intended to provide context to the sections below where
estimates of the effects of local economic conditions on health rely on the assumption that
readily available control variables are sufficient to capture the effect of economic conditions on
the composition of residents in an area (as the composition relates to health).
7

In contrast, the five regions used in the United States census were developed in the 1880s with similar
intentions.
8
For example, a Component Economic Area would be considered too small to form an Economic Area if
it consisted of fewer than three counties and fewer than 500,000 employed residents. Also note that 167 of
344 Component Economic Areas are sufficiently large that they also serve as independent Economic Areas; the
remaining 177 combine to create the remaining 12 Economic Areas.

5

For this analysis, I use the entire sample of individuals in the PSID from 1968 to 1997 who
are above 23 years old, with the exception of the special “Latino Sample” that was surveyed
from 1990 to 1995.9 Migration across areas is measured by an individual’s residential location
each year. For example, if an individual reports living in California one year and Oregon the
next, they are coded as having moved states but are coded as not having moved to a new BEA
region.10
In order to estimate the effect of economic conditions on migration, I use the following
linear-probability model
M oveit = Epopit β + αt + γi + uit ,

(1)

where M oveit is an indicator variable that takes a one if an individual moves areas before the
next year, Epopit is the employment-to-population ratio in an individual’s area in the current
year calculated using county-level employment counts from the BLS and population counts from
the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER),
αt are year fixed effects, γi are individual fixed effects, and uit is a random error term that is
allowed to be correlated across t within i.11 The individual fixed effects control for the possibility
that certain types of individuals may be more mobile and also tend to live in areas with strong
economies.
In order to explore heterogeneity across socioeconomic status, I use the following linearprobability model

M oveit = Epopit β + (Epopit × SESi )φ + αt + γi + uit ,

(2)

where SESi is a measure of socioeconomic status and the estimate of φ will reveal the extent
to which the economic-conditions-migration gradient varies across socioeconomic status.
The results of this analysis are shown in Table 1. Column 1, which simply considers the
effect of local economic conditions on migration, indicates that individuals are more likely to
move out of an area when its economic conditions worsen, whether one defines areas as a states,
BEA Economic Areas, BEA Component Economic Areas, or counties. That said, the results of
this analysis indicate that individuals are less likely to move regions when regional economic

conditions worsen. Though this difference is interesting, for the purposes of understanding the
link between economic conditions and health, documenting whether migratory responses are
heterogeneous across individual characteristics that are known to be associated with health
outcomes is of primary concern. For this purpose, I focus on two measures of socioeconomic
status that cannot be reliably measured for small-area populations that can be measured using
the PSID: high school education and permanent income decile. The measure of education is
based on whether an individual has 12 or more years of education. An individual’s permanent
income is based on their average residuals from a regression of incomes on age and year fixed effects interacted with gender.12 Consistent with earlier research, the estimates in columns 2 and
3 routinely indicate that high-socioeconomic-status individuals are more likely to leave an area
when it experiences an economic downturn. Thus, the area approach to estimating the effects of
unemployment on health will likely understate the improvements in health caused by economic
downturns if the typical battery of demographic controls does not fully capture these compositional changes. Of particular relevance to the analyses that follow, there is not strong evidence
that behavioral difference differs across different definitions of areas. As such, it seems unlikely any migration-induced bias would generate differences in the economic-conditions-health
relationship when the analysis is conducted at different levels of geographic aggregation.13

Methodology and Updates to Earlier Research
Before presenting estimates of the link between local economic conditions and health out-

comes using different definitions of areas in the next section, in this section I present the estimated effects from prior state-level studies, adapt the estimation strategies in a way that allows
more-disaggregated analyses, consider how these changes alter the estimates, and then extend
the analyses to include additional years of data. I begin by focusing on mortality outcomes and
then turn to infant health outcomes.
12

Only years in which an individual is less than 62 years old and is the head of household or the ‘spouse’ of
the head of the household (as defined by the PSID) are used for this calculation.
13
Though racial composition can be measured reasonably well for small areas, I have also investigated the
extent to which there are racial differences in the migratory response to changing economic conditions. These
estimates reveal that whites are more likely to leave an area in response to downturns than non-whites, except
when considering moves across counties in response to changing county-level economic conditions.

Mortality

In his highly influential study, Ruhm (2000) considers the effects of macroeconomic conditions on health using mortality rates from Vital Statistics of the United States publications and
estimates of the unemployment rate from the BLS. In order to focus on within-area variation,
Ruhm’s estimates are based on the regression equation

Hat = Eat β + Xat δ + αt + γa + θa t + at ,

(3)

where Hat is a measure of health for area a in year t, Eat is a measure of economic conditions,
Xat is a vector of time-varying controls, αt are year fixed effects, γa are area fixed effects, and
θa t are area-specific time trends. To operationalize this identification strategy, Ruhm defines
a as a state, Hat as the natural log of the mortality rate (deaths per 100,000), Eat as the
unemployment rate, and Xat includes the fraction of the state population that is: less than five
years old, 5–64 years old, greater than 64 years old, black, hispanic, a high school dropout, has
some college, is a college graduate.14 In Column 1 of Table 2, I display the estimate based on
these data and definitions while clustering the standard error estimate on the state.15 The point
estimate indicates that a one-percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate is associated
with a 0.54-percent decrease in overall mortality.
As the starting point for my analysis, I begin with the approach used in Stevens et al.
(2011) who extend Ruhm (2000) in several ways. First, they create mortality rates using death
counts from Vital Statistics’ micro-record multiple-cause-of-death files and population data from
SEER (described above). Second, they pool monthly Current Population Survey data in order
to construct overall unemployment rates and unemployment rates for separate demographic
groups, which requires them to focus on data from 1978–2006. Third, they include a richer set
of controls for the fraction of a state’s population in various age brackets (less than 5, 5–17,
18–30, greater than 64) using the aforementioned population data, construct the fraction black
with the aforementioned population data, and use CPS data to measure the fraction Hispanic
and the fraction in each education group.16 Last, they replace the natural log of the mortality
rate with the natural log of the age-adjusted mortality rate to account for uneven changes in
14

These control variables are calculated by interpolating between decennial censuses. Additionally, estimates
are weighted by the population in each state.
15
As Ruhm (2000) did not present estimates that clustered standard errors, this estimate is taken from Stevens
et al. (2011) who replicate and extend Ruhm’s analysis.
16
The fraction in each age group is based solely off of individuals who are at least 25 years old.

the age distribution across states. The age-adjusted mortality rate is calculated by taking the
weighted average of the mortality rate for each age, using as weights the fraction of individuals
in each age category in the US in 1990. After making these changes, their estimate (shown in
Column 2 of Table 2) indicates that a one-percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate
is associated with a 0.33-percent decrease in overall mortality.
In columns 3 through 9 of Table 2, I progressively make changes to this estimation strategy,
ultimately arriving at an approach that can also be used in more-disaggregated county-level
analyses. These changes are as follows:
• Use state-level unemployment rates published by the BLS for convenience. This change
has no impact on the estimated effect (Column 3).
• Omit controls for the fraction Hispanic and the fraction in each education category, which
cannot be reliably measured for small counties. This change has no impact on the estimated effect (Column 4).
• Add data from 1976, 1977, and 2007 to the analysis. Incorporating the earlier years of
data has a substantial impact on the estimate, causing it to fall from -0.0033 to -0.0044
(Column 5). Adding 2007 data to the analysis has only a small impact on the estimate
(Column 6).
• Restrict the sample to individuals living in counties with at least one person of each
age (0–85) in 1990 so that age-adjusted mortality rates can be calculated at the county
level. Also, omit data from Alaska and Hawaii where county codes are unavailable in the
early years of the data and from Virginia where there have been substantial changes to
county definitions over time. So that the unemployment rates correctly correspond to the
counties contributing to the state-level estimates, use county-level BLS data to construct
unemployment rates. These changes have a negligible impact on the estimate (Column
7).
• Use the death rate as the outcome variable rather than the log of the death rate, which
may be undefined in small counties. The semi-elasticity based on this estimate (Column
8), calculated by dividing coefficient estimate by the mean of the outcome, is somewhat
larger than the direct estimate in obtained in Column 7.
• Use the employment-to-population ratio as the measure of economic conditions. The
9

semi-elasticity based on this estimate (Column 9) is smaller than the semi-elasticity for
unemployment rates.

5.2

Infant Health

Like Ruhm (2000), Dehejia and Lleras-Muney (2004) conduct a state-level analysis—also
characterized by Equation 3—but instead focus on various measures of infant health and the
effects of economic conditions at the time of conception. As their primary outcome measures,
they consider the fraction of children who have low birth weight (less than 2500 grams) and
the fraction who have very low birth weight (less than 1500 grams), calculated at the race-bystate-by-year level based on vital statistics birth records for white and black mothers at least
18 years old. As their primary measure of economic conditions, they use state unemployment
rates in the year of conception, which they base on the timing of the mother’s last menstrual
period. Column 1 of Table 3 displays their estimates, which indicate that a one-percentagepoint increase in the unemployment rate reduces the incidence of low birth weight 0.26 percent
and reduces the incidence of very low birth weight by 0.54 percent.17
In columns 2 through 9 of Table 3, I progressively make changes to the estimation strategy,
ultimately arriving at an approach that can also be used in more-disaggregated county-level
analyses. In Column 2, I instead define a child’s year of conception as nine months prior to
birth and include in the analysis children born to mothers for whom information on the last
menstrual cycle is missing. The subsequent columns progressively include children classified as
“other race” to the analysis and an indicator variable for “other race” to the regression model
(Column 3); include children born to mothers of all ages (Column 4); collapse the state-by-yearby-race level data to the state-by-year level while adding controls for the fraction in each race
category (Column 5); control for the age distribution of mothers with variables corresponding
to the fraction of mothers who are less than 18 years old, 18–22 years old, 23–28 years old, and
29–34 years old (Column 6); update the sample to include data from 2000–2006 (Column 7);
and then construct the sample based on data available at the county level, i.e., omitting data
from Alaska, Hawaii, and Virginia for the reasons described above (Column 8). These changes
tend to have only minor impacts on the estimated effects with one exception. When the data
is extended from 1976–1999 to 1976–2006 the estimated effect of unemployment increases by

approximately 60 percent, suggesting that effect of economic conditions on newborn health has
grown over time. Column 9 indicates that using the employment-to-population ratio as the
measure of economic conditions produces similar results.

Estimates of the Unemployment-Health Relationship Using
Different Definitions of Area
In this section, I explore how the estimated effects of economic conditions on health outcomes

vary with different levels of geographic aggregation using the identification strategy described
in the previous section. Though the convention in this literature is to cluster standard errors
at the area level, to the extent to which the errors may be correlated for adjacent areas, it may
instead be appropriate to cluster on broader areas where possible, e.g., clustering on regions
for state-level analyses. That said, it turns out that the standard error estimates based on the
conventional approach are either identical to or more conservative than estimates that cluster
on broader areas, except when the analysis is conducted at the county level. For county-level
estimates, clustering the standard errors at the state level yields the most conservative estimates.
As such, I use this approach where applicable.
Column 1 of Table 4 focuses on how the estimated effects of economic conditions on overall
mortality varies with different levels of geographic aggregation across panels A through E.
Using the broadest definition of area, region, the estimate indicates that a one-percentage-point
increase in the employment-to-population ratio is associated with a 0.51-percent increase in
mortality. As we progressively consider more narrowly defined areas, there is a monotonic
decline in the magnitude of the estimated effect. In particular, the point estimate shrinks by
25 percent as we move from the region level to the state level; shrinks another 18 percent
as we move to the BEA-Economic-Area level; shrinks another 6 percent as we move to the
BEA-Component-Economic-Area level; and then shrinks another 69 percent as we move to the
county level. At the county level, the estimate indicates that a one-percentage-point increase
in the employment-to-population ratio is associated with a 0.09-percent increase in mortality.
Although this estimate is less than a third of the estimate based on state-level data, it remains
highly significant at conventional levels.
Columns 2 through 4 take a similar approach but separately estimate the effects on youth
mortality (age 0–17), working-age mortality (age 18–64), and elderly mortality (age 65+). This

11

exercise is motivated by Miller et al. (2009) who explain that, even though unemployment has a
similar percentage impact on younger and older individuals, the additional deaths that tend to
be observed during recessions largely consist of the elderly because their baseline mortality rate
is so high. Again, the magnitudes of the estimates are smaller in more-disaggregated analyses.
Finally, columns 5 through 8 show estimated effects on five major causes of death: cardiovascular problems, cancer, disease (including respiratory, infections and immune deficiencies,
degenerative brain diseases, and kidney problems), motor-vehicle accidents, and suicides.18
Echoing earlier work, these estimates reveal that local downturns reduce deaths due to cardiovascular causes and motor-vehicle accidents. That said, these estimates shrink in magnitude
in more-disaggregated analyses, though they remain significant due to increased precision. Interestingly, only the region-level analysis indicates that economic downturns significantly increase
suicides.
Table 5 presents a similar analysis but instead focuses on the effect of the economic conditions
at the time of conception on the incidence of low and very low birth weights. Though the
estimates are always positive, indicating that local downturns improve infant health, as in
Table 4 the magnitudes of the estimated effects decline as areas are defined more narrowly.
Columns 3 through 5 address the extent to which changing economic conditions may affect
the composition of newborns. In particular, Column 3 shows the estimated effect of economic
conditions on the birth rate (defined as the number of births per 1,0000 women between the ages
of 15 and 44). This estimate is always positive (and highly significant in more-disaggregated
analyses), indicating that economic downturns reduce fertility rates.19 That said, the estimated
effects on the fraction of births to white mothers and the fraction of births to mothers under
the age of 18 are usually not significant, lending support to the notion that the improvements
in infant health observed during recessions are not due changes in the underlying composition
of mothers giving birth. The county-level estimates serve as an exception, however, as they
indicate that deteriorating economic conditions at the county level are associated with more
births to teen mothers and fewer births to white mothers, which we would expect to reduce the
incidence of low birth weight at the county level. As such, the fact that there is no significant
link between county employment-to-population ratios and the incidence of low birth weight is

The results discussed above clearly illustrate that the choice of geographic aggregation has
a dramatic influence on the estimated relationship between economic conditions and health.
In particular, more-disaggregated analyses severely understate the extent to which local downturns improve health. While simply establishing this fact is the main contribution of this paper,
it naturally raises the question why? Given that the economic-conditions-migration gradient
across socioeconomic status is similar across different definitions of areas (Section 4), two possibilities seem most likely. First, broader economic conditions may have greater impacts on
health. To the extent to which the effects may be driven by individuals’ perceptions of the economic conditions they face, this explanation is quite plausible given that individuals may view
their ‘local’ labor market quite broadly and that broader changes in economic conditions are
likely to garner more media attention. That said, lacking a valid instrument for employmentto-population ratios, we cannot rule out that this systematic pattern arises due to differences
in measurement-error bias at differing levels of geographic aggregation.20

Leveraging County-Level Data for Additional Insights
In this section, I use county-level data to shed light on several questions that are difficult if

not impossible to answer using the state-level data used in prior studies.

7.1

Simultaneously Estimating Effects of More- and Less-Local Economic
Conditions

The fact that more-disaggregated analyses systematically yield estimates that are relatively
small in magnitude raises the question: do local economic conditions matter at all or do the
effects of local economic conditions simply reflect the effects of broader economic conditions?
To investigate this issue, I use county-level data to separately identify the effects of county
economic conditions, state economic conditions, and regional economic conditions. Because we
are interested in the effect of economic conditions in an individual’s own county versus the
effect of economic conditions in other counties in an individual’s state and region, for each
20

There are certainly alternative measures of economic conditions that could be used as instruments but none
seem satisfying. For example, employment counts produced by the BEA could be used to construct an alternative
measure of the employment-to-population ratio. However, despite the fact that the BEA and BLS independently
produce employment estimates, they largely use the same data; thus, the errors would not be independent.
Moreover, as fundamentally different measures of economic conditions—BLS measures employment for county
residents whereas the BEA measures the number of jobs in a county—the BEA measure may be independently
related to health outcomes. Other measures of local economic conditions would appear to suffer from similar
problems when considered as instruments.

13

observation the measure of statewide economic conditions is calculated using information from
the other counties in its state and the measure of regional economic conditions is calculated
using information from the other states in its region.
Table 6 shows the results of this analysis for mortality outcomes. Though these estimates
continue to indicate that state and regional economic conditions are more strongly related to
mortality than county economic conditions, they do reveal that county economic conditions have
an independent effect on health. Similarly, these estimates indicate that state-level economic
conditions affect mortality independently of the effects of regional economic conditions.
Table 7 presents a similar analysis for infant outcomes. Though the estimates corresponding
to the fraction of newborns with low birth weight and very low birthweight are intriguing,
potential composition bias makes interpretation difficult. That said, it is quite notable that
this analysis suggests that fertility is more strongly related to the measure of regional economic
conditions than to the measure of state economic conditions which is more strongly related
to fertility than the measure of county economic conditions. As before, all of these estimates
indicate that fertility is procyclical.

7.2

Do Local Downturns Improve Health Everywhere in the US?

The area approach has been used to estimate the effect of economic conditions on health in
several different contexts since Ruhm (2000) and Dehejia and Lleras-Muney’s (2004) analyses
of the United States. In particular, local downturns have been shown to improve health using
data from 16 German states (Neumayer 2004), 50 Spanish provinces (Tapia Granados 2005),
8 Asia-Pacific countries (Lin 2009), 23 OECD countries (Gerdtham and Ruhm 2006), and 21
Swedish regions (Svensson 2010).21 With county-level data, we have the ability to separately
assess the extent to which local downturns improve health for each US state.
Acknowledging that broader measures of economic conditions are more strongly related to
mortality than narrow measures, Figure 2 shows state-specific estimates of the link between
county employment-to-population ratios and overall mortality rates.22 The black squares plot
the estimated effects for each state and the whiskers show the associated confidence intervals.
Though these state-specific estimates are often too imprecise to reject zero, a majority of the
estimates are positive (31 of 47), indicating that local downturns reduce mortality for most
21
See Ruhm (2008) for an in-depth review of many of these and other related studies. As discussed in the next
section, the relationship often runs in the opposite directions for developing countries.

states. However, this figure illustrates that there is substantial heterogeneity and suggests that
local downturns increase mortality in some states.
Though I present similar figures for each of the health outcomes explored in previous sections in Appendix A.1, they are usually similar to Figure 2 or too imprecise to be informative.
One exception is the figure depicting state-specific estimates for the effects of local economic
conditions on birth rates. These estimates are positive for a vast majority of the states considered (37 of 47) and are usually statistically significant (28 of 47), providing further evidence
that fertility is procyclical. Moreover, the increases in fertility are disproportionately due do
white mothers having more children, as the estimated effect on the fraction of white mothers is
also positively related to employment-to-population ratios for most states.

7.3

Income and The Unemployment-Health Relationship

In this section, I conduct a meta-analysis of sorts using each of the state-specific estimates
from the previous section. In particular, using each state as an observation, I consider whether
state income levels can explain the extent to which mortality is procyclical. This exercise is
motivated by the fact that several studies have found that economic downturns lead to poorer
health in developing countries despite a wide body of evidence that downturns improve health
in developed countries like the United States.23 As such, we might expect the improvements in
health associated with recessions to be especially large in high-income states.
To investigate this hypothesis, Figure 3 plots the estimated effect of county employmentto-population ratios on mortality for each state against its median income (based on the 1990
Census). Perhaps in contrast to expectations, this figure reveals a clear negative relationship
(p-value=0.006). That is, it indicates that local downturns improve health most in relativelydisadvantaged states. Of course, it should be noted that this correlation is based on a relatively
small sample. That said, Figure 4 shows that the same pattern is evident for all of the health
outcomes considered in this paper.
Figures exploring the extent to which other measures of economic development predict the
effect of county economic conditions on health outcomes are—shown in Appendix A.2—largely
tell the same story. In particular, local downturns appear to improve health most in states with
low poverty rates and a large share of college graduates. That said, the fraction of a state that

Conclusion
In this paper, I have demonstrated that the migratory response to fluctuations in local

economic conditions are an important consideration for studies that use the area approach to
estimate the effects of unemployment on health; however, because high-socioeconomic-status
individuals are more likely to leave an area when its unemployment rate rises, this phenomenon
will tend to result in estimates that understate the health improvements caused by recessions.
I have also demonstrated that there is much to be gained by conducting more-disaggregated
analyses of the effects of economic conditions on health, though the potential for measurement
error to bias estimates based on measures of economic conditions for small areas must be
acknowledged. With county-level data, we learn that broader measures of economic conditions
are stronger predictors of mortality than county measures; that there is substantial heterogeneity
in the extent to which declining county economic conditions are associated with reductions
in mortality; and that local downturns improve health most in states that have relativelydisadvantaged populations. More broadly, the estimates presented in this paper suggest that
recessions improve health even more than we may have thought given the existing literature.

State-Specific Estimates of The Effect of County Economic Conditions on Overall Mortality

Notes: Each black square represents the estimated effect of local economic conditions—as measured by county employmentto-population ratios—on overall mortality for a given state, while the whiskers represent the associated 95-percent confidence
intervals. These estimates are based on county-level data spanning 1976 to 2007, control for year fixed effects, county fixed
effects, county-specific trends, and demographic characteristics while weighting estimates by the county population and
clustering standard-error estimates at the county level. See Section 7.2 for further information. County-level data is based
on employment counts produced by the BLS, population data produced by SEER, and death counts from restricted-use
Vital Statistics’ micro-record multiple-cause-of-death files provided by the NCHS.

Notes: Data aggregated to the area level, spanning 1976–2007, are based on labor force data produced by the BLS, population data produced by SEER, and death counts from restricted-use
Vital Statistics’ micro-record multiple-cause-of-death files provided by the NCHS. All estimates control for year fixed effects, area fixed effects, area-specific trends, and demographics, and are
weighted by the population in each cell. Standard-error estimates, shown in parentheses, are clustered on the area defined by the level of geographic aggregation, except for the county-level
analyses where standard-error estimates are more conservative when clustered at the state level.

Additional State-Specific Estimates
NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLICATION
Notes for all tables in Appendix A.1: Each black square represents the estimated
effect of county employment-to-population ratios on the outcome for a given state
while the whiskers represent the associated 95-percent confidence intervals. These
estimates are based on county-level data, control for year fixed effects, county fixed
effects, county-specific trends, and demographic characteristics while weighting estimates by the relevant population and clustering standard-error estimates at the
county level.

Appendix A.2
Additional State Characteristics and the Cyclicality of Health Outcomes
NOT INTENDED FOR PUBLICATION
Notes for all tables in Appendix A.2: Each observation represents a state. Its horizontal position is a measure of the state’s characteristics and its vertical position
is the estimated effect of county employment-to-population ratios on a health outcome. The size of each observation is proportional to the size of the population that
it represents over the sample period. The reported correlations also uses population
weights. For additional notes on the state-specific estimates, see Figure 2 or Appendix A.1. For matters of convenience, state poverty rates are based on the 1990
Census and the fraction of a state’s adult population with a high school (college)
education is based on the CPS from 1978–2006.
