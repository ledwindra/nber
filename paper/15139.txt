ABSTRACT
We develop a theoretical model to study the effects of libertarian paternalism on knowledge acquisition
and social learning. Individuals in our model are permitted to appreciate and use the information content
in the default options set by the government. We show that in some settings libertarian paternalism
may decrease welfare because default options slow information aggregation in the market. We also
analyze what happens when the government acquires imprecise information about individuals, and
characterize its incentives to avoid full disclosure of its information to the market, even when it has
perfect information. Finally, we consider a market in which individuals can sell their information to
others and show that the presence of default options causes the quality of advice to decrease, which
may lower social welfare.

Introduction

Libertarian paternalism, as posed by Thaler and Sunstein (2003, 2008), is arguably one of the
most provocative policy contributions in the last two decades. Its beauty stems from its link
between two ideas that are on the surface contradictory, but may indeed be an uncompromising
compromise. Libertarian paternalism allows a social planner to direct market participants through
default options without imposing his will, so that everyone may enjoy the best of both worlds:
guidance without the tax of obtrusion.
Not everyone agrees that such a policy is innocuous. For example, Glaeser (2006) argues
that libertarian paternalism may also cause bad decisions, is harder to publicly monitor, and
may inevitably lead to hard paternalism. Korobkin (2009) argues that, even though libertarian
paternalism may induce individuals to make optimal decisions for themselves, collective welfare may
decrease. These objections raise an obvious question: When do we expect libertarian paternalism
to be welfare improving?
To explore this, we analyze an important dimension of this debate: the effect of libertarian
paternalism on information acquisition and social learning. We know from Madrian and Shea (2001)
that default options provide information to market participants, which may change both their
perceptions and resultant actions. Such intervention also impacts the effectiveness of learning
through social interaction (e.g., Duflo and Saez, 2003). So, if learning from others and incentives
to acquire information decrease sufficiently when people are guided by a social planner, whether
they are forced to make choices or not, total welfare may decrease. This implies that in some
circumstances it may be optimal to either implement a limited form of libertarian paternalism or
to leave market participants alone, even if some people’s choices end up regrettably suboptimal.
We characterize some settings in which providing default options may decrease welfare because
information acquisition and aggregation slows. We do this both when information percolates according to a social learning technology (e.g., Duffie and Manso, 2007) and in a market setting in
which informed participants can sell their information to others.
In the model that we analyze, there is a continuum of heterogeneous individuals, who each share
a common characteristic that is known by the government. The government has to decide whether
to disclose this information through a default option or to keep the information to themselves.
Individuals may also exert costly effort to find out their own types, which includes the government’s
information, so that they make an even better decision. As a group, higher aggregate effort also
decreases the costs for any one individual to become informed. This form of social learning provides

1

an externality where one individual’s effort affects other peoples’ welfare and vice versa.
We derive conditions under which default options are optimal and describe when they destroy
social surplus. When the information-sharing technology is sufficiently effective, the cost of information acquisition is low, and/or the agent-specific information is more valuable, providing a
default option is suboptimal. Under these conditions, a social planner maximizes welfare by letting
market participants fend for themselves and allowing social learning to take place. Alternatively,
if the information known by the planner is relatively more valuable and these other conditions do
not hold, then default options add value.
This sheds light on when libertarian paternalism is likely to add value. Default options are likely
to be welfare-improving when individuals are homogeneous. For example, consider the default
option of organ donation following a lethal car accident. There is little variation in the quality
of healthy organs from different individuals following an accident. In this case, donation as a
default is likely to add value. Default options are also likely to be welfare-improving when the
information acquired by the planner is relatively valuable compared to the information gathered by
individuals. This motivates why default options to participate in a 401(k) retirement plan are so
useful. However, default options are unlikely to increase social welfare when peoples’ needs are more
heterogeneous or when the information acquired by individuals is relatively valuable compared to
the information contained in the default option. An example of this may be portfolio allocation
problems. If providing defaults for this decision decreases some peoples’ incentives to become savvy,
this may lead to a drop in welfare.
We proceed to consider what happens when the government acquires imperfect information
about its constituents. In this case, systematic errors decrease the accuracy for people who use the
default options, but increase the effort that individual’s employ to acquire and aggregate information. We show that the latter effect dominates the former in that issuing no default is more likely
to be of value when the government’s information is imperfect. Therefore, our analysis addresses
the objection raised by Glaeser that social planners are not immune from making errors or having
biases.
Given this, we then consider whether the government would ever want to issue an imperfect
default even though they have perfect information. We show this not to be the case. That is,
despite being given a broader action space including noisy defaults, the government’s optimal
choice is binary: either issue a fully informative default option or leave individuals to fend for
themselves. The same comparative statics still hold as before, which supports the generality of our
findings.
2

Finally, we characterize a market in which information sales are allowed to take place. A fraction of the population are recognized as information gatherers (e.g., brokers in financial markets),
whereas the remainder rely on advice markets for guidance. The government faces the same problem as before, and information gatherers decide how much costly effort to employ in accumulating
knowledge. The difference here is that there is no social learning technology. Rather, information
gatherers may sell their information to the rest of the public for a price. In this version of the
model, the presence of a default option decreases the value of advice. That is, since fewer information gatherers will become knowledgeable, the quality of advice in the market suffers. As in the
base model, not offering a default option dominates issuing a default option if the cost of effort
is low and the value of agent-specific (government) information is high (low). This finding is not
dependent on market power, that is, whether the industry is competitive or the advisors have local
monopoly power.
The analysis in this paper contributes to the literature on the distortions of paternalism, whether
hard or soft (i.e., libertarian paternalism).1 Bentham (1781) and Hayek (1945) argue that despite
the best intentions of a social planner, individuals have both an advantage in gathering precise information about themselves and a greater incentive to do so. As such, any policy that impedes such
progress is welfare decreasing. More recently, hard paternalism has been studied by O’Donoghue
and Rabin (2003, 2006) who analyze the unintended consequences of sin taxes. Likewise, Camerer
et al. (2003) study a form of asymmetric paternalism to minimize such distortions. As mentioned
previously, with the recent advent of soft paternalism (e.g., Thaler and Sunstein, 2003), several
critics have been wary of unintended consequences induced by such policies (e.g., Glaeser 2006; Korobkin, 2009; Zanitelli, 2009). Our analysis adds to this literature by showing when and where soft
paternalism is likely to work and when it is likely to destroy social surplus. Consistent with Bentham (1781) and Hayek (1945), if the knowledge of the government pales in importance compared
to what individuals need to know about themselves, libertarian paternalism is likely to be suboptimal. However, if people are more homogeneous and the government’s information is accurate and
valuable, employing soft paternalism is optimal.
Our work also builds on the work by Carroll et al. (2008) who study optimal default options in a
dynamic model, given that individuals tend to procrastinate in making important decisions. They
show that default options can function as a control device: when individuals have a hyperbolic
discount function, offering a biased default induces people to opt out and make educated decisions
sooner. Our focus in this paper is obviously different. We consider that there is information content

in default options, and that this may effect information acquisition and aggregation by people in
the market. We show that the government will either issue a fully informative default or no default
at all, but never discloses only a portion of their information.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines our basic model and
determines when it is optimal to use default options. In Section 2.1, we consider that the government
can only issue fully informative default options, whereas in Section 2.2 we consider imperfect default
options. In Section 3, we allow for information sales. Section 4 provides some concluding remarks.

Social Learning

2.1

Basic Model

The economy is composed of a government and a continuum (a non-atomic finite measure space
(I, I, γ)) of heterogeneous, rational individuals who all face a significant economic decision. Examples of such a decision might be an investment-consumption choice, a capital allocation decision, or
a choice of insurance. For simplicity, but without loss of generality, we set the total measure γ(I)
of individuals to 1 (i.e., a unit mass).
The ex post utility from the decision for each individual i ∈ I is given by
Ũi (xi ) = −(τ̃i − xi )2 ,

(1)

where xi ∈ R is a choice variable and τ̃i is the individual’s true type. The type τ̃i is the sum a
component g̃ that is common to all individuals and an idiosyncratic component t̃i that is specific to
individual i. We assume that g̃ and t̃i are two independent normally distributed random variables,
each with zero mean and respective variances Σg and Σt , and that Cov(t̃i , t̃j ) = ρΣt , with ρ ∈ [0, 1),
for any {i, j} ∈ I 2 with i 6= j.2 Thus, for each individual i, τ̃i is normally distributed with a mean of
zero and a variance of Στ ≡ Σg + Σt . As (1) is a quadratic loss function, the goal of each individual
is to choose xi to be as close to τ̃i as possible in order to minimize the expected loss that they
suffer.
Before choosing xi , each individual i can exert some effort in order to improve the probability
that he finds out about his own type. An individual who selects an effort level ei ∈ [0, 1] observes
his true type τ̃i (i.e., receives an informative signal) with probability ei , and observes nothing
otherwise. Individuals know when they did not receive an informative signal. An individual’s effort

Note that the positive correlation across the idiosyncratic component ti of individuals’ types does not play a role
until we allow for information sales, in section 3.

of ei comes with a personal utility cost of
c
C(ei ) = (e2i − αē2 ),
2
where ē ≡

R

I ei dγ,

(2)

α ∈ [0, 1), and c is a positive constant. Given that ē represents the average effort

exerted by individuals in the population, the cost specification in (2) implies that it is cheaper to
learn one’s own type when many individuals seek to learn theirs. This positive externality of effort
captures the idea that as more people exert effort and more of the population becomes informed,
their interactions lead to more spillovers in the learning process that ultimately make it easier
for anyone to learn about the economic decision that they have to make. While not specifically
modeled, the micro-foundation for this setup might be a model of search in which the distance
that a person travels to gather information decreases as more of the population is informed. The
parameter α measures the degree of this information externality.
The government costlessly observes the common component g̃ of the individual’s types. For
example, this could correspond to the government having an informed opinion about the optimal
average savings rate for a group of individuals. The government then chooses whether to set a
default option that takes g̃ into account or to leave individuals to their own devices. Its goal in
this choice is to maximize total welfare. Since individuals are rational, they are able to glean
information about g̃ from a default option if it is offered.3,4 This, in turn, will affect their choice of
effort in gathering further information.
Let Si denote the information set of an individual i at the time he must make his decision xi .
This set is equal to {τ˜i } if the individual observes his true type, whether or not the government
sets a default option.5 When there is a default option and the individual does not observe his type,
Si = {g̃}. Finally, when there is no default option and the individual does not observe his type,
Si = ∅. The following lemma defines the optimal choice of xi , given the information set Si .


Lemma 1. The optimal choice of xi for individual i is E τ̃i | Si .

With a default option, each individual i who observes an informative signal opts out of the

default and chooses xi = τ̃i , whereas any individual who remains uninformed does not opt out, i.e.,
3

As long as the government’s choice for the default option is one-to-one with g̃, every individual can infer g̃
perfectly. Thus it is without loss of generality that we assume in what follows that the government announces g̃ as
the default option when it makes such an option available.
4
A key difference between our model and that of Carroll et al. (2008) is that each individual i is free to extract
the benefit from the information in g̃ and to use it for his decision xi , without incurring any penalty for not choosing
xi = g̃.
5
Technically speaking, the information set is {g̃, τ̃i } when the government announces a default option and individual i observes his type, but the additional information provided by g̃ (i.e., knowing g̃ and τ̃i separately) is not useful
for any of the decisions that this individual must make.

5

chooses xi = g̃, as prescribed by the government. If no default option is offered by the government,
any individual i who becomes informed still chooses xi = τ̃i , and chooses xi = 0 if they do not get
to observe an informative signal. Consistent with Madrian and Shea’s (2001) empirical findings,
there is information content in the default options that the government provides, as uninformed
individuals optimally (and rationally) choose to use them.
Before choosing xi but after the government’s decision to announce a default option, each
individual i chooses the effort level ei that maximizes his expected utility. This choice takes into
account the fact that he will subsequently choose xi according to Lemma 1. It also depends on the
individual i’s information set Si0 which is then g̃ if the government makes a default option available
and is empty otherwise. The following lemma summarizes and simplifies this maximization problem.
Lemma 2. Individual i chooses his effort level ei to maximize

E Ũi (xi ) − C(ei ) | Si0 = −(1 − ei ) (1 − δ)Σg + Σt − (e2i − αē2 ),

(3)

where δ = 1 when a default option g̃ is offered by the government and δ = 0 when people are left to
their own devices.
This result highlights the tradeoff faced by each individual. Effort is costly (second term in (3))
but it reduces the variance that the individual is subject to (first term in (3)). At the same time,
the concerted effort of every individual creates a public good, ē, that lowers costs for everyone.
Going forward, we make the following assumption, which guarantees an interior solution to the
effort problem but does not affect the economics of the analysis.
Assumption 1. The cost parameter c is such that c > Σg + Σt .
The following proposition characterizes the effort choice of individuals, with and without a
default option.
Proposition 1. If the government adopts a default option, each individual chooses effort
eD
i =

Σt
,
c

(4)

whereas if the government does not adopt a default option, each individual chooses effort
eNi =

Σg + Σt
.
c

6

(5)

Inspection of (4) and (5) shows that individuals exert more effort with higher Σt and lower c.
That is, the more variance about an individual’s type that is resolved when an informative signal is
obtained and the lower the cost of acquisition, the more effort each individual is willing to employ.
Importantly, it is also the case that
eNi = eD
i +

Σg
.
c

This implies that people exert more effort without a default option, and that the difference between
eNi and eD
i increases as Σg gets larger and as c gets smaller. Since the positive externality ē comes
from the average effort of people in the economy, it follows that there are greater opportunities
for people to learn from each other when default options are not provided by the government. In
this sense, whether a default option is welfare improving depends on the strength of the learning
externality relative to the value of the information that the government has in its possession.
Given Proposition 1 and Lemma 2, we can compute the total welfare with a default option as
W D = −Σt +

(1 + α)Σ2t
,
2c

(6)

(1 + α)(Σg + Σt )2
.

(7)

and the total welfare without a default option as
W N = −(Σg + Σt ) +

The next proposition compares welfare with and without a default option.
Proposition 2. The total welfare W N without a default option is higher than the total welfare W D
with a default option if the cost parameter c is in the following region:
Σg + Σt < c < (Σg + 2Σt )

1+α
.

(8)

This region is non-empty if and only if
Γ≡

Σg + Σt
1+α

(9)

According to Proposition 2, welfare without a default option may be higher than welfare with
a default option. This arises because the presence of a default option reduces people’s incentives to
learn about the economic problem they face, which in turn slows the pace of information propagation
throughout the economy. In other words the very presence of a default option creates an incentive
for the population to herd into it, a damaging effect when people can learn a lot from each other
(i.e., when α is large), and when the cost of information acquisition is low (i.e., when c is small).
As shown in (9), the availability of a default option is more likely to be detrimental if the portion
7

Γ of the volatility that the government can eliminate with its information about g̃ is small relative
to the extent of information externalities.
To gain further insight into this result, let us use (6) and (7) and define the difference
∆W ≡ W N − W D = −Σg +

(1 + α)Σg (Σg + 2Σt )
.
2c

(10)

Notice that, since Σg = ΓΣτ and Σt = (1 − Γ)Στ , we can rewrite this expression as
∆W = −ΓΣτ +

(1 + α)Γ(2 − Γ)Σ2τ
.
2c

(11)

It is easy to verify that, holding the total variance Στ fixed, we have
∂(∆W )
(1 + α)(1 − Γ)Σ2τ
= −Στ +
,
∂Γ
c

(12)

and this quantity is positive if and only if
Γ<1−

c
.
(1 + α)Στ

That is, an increase in the ability of the government to curb variance by revealing its knowledge of
g̃ through a default option makes this option relatively less appealing when Γ is small or the total
variance Στ is large. In other words, when important information about individuals is unobservable
to the government (small Γ) or when there is a lot of uncertainty about the individuals’ economic
decision (large Στ ), increasing the precision of this information makes default options less appealing,
as such options then have a particularly detrimental effect on information gathering incentives, and
in turn on information sharing.
Similarly, after fixing the proportion Γ of the total variance that the government can control,
we have
∂(∆W )
(1 + α)Γ(2 − Γ)Στ
= −Γ +
,
∂Στ
c

(13)

which is positive if and only if
Στ >

c
.
(1 + α)(2 − Γ)

Thus an increase in overall uncertainty renders the presence of default options detrimental to
welfare when this uncertainty is large to begin with (large Στ ) and when the government’s ability
to reduce uncertainty is limited (small Γ). The former effect has two potential interpretations.
First, Στ might proxy for the amount of heterogeneity in the population: when peoples’ needs
or attributes differ a lot, default options are more likely to be suboptimal. Second, Στ might
also proxy for the economic value at risk in each individual’s decision: when decisions are more
8

important, the government should refrain from issuing a default in order to promote learning and
information sharing by individuals. The latter effect is directly related to the information gathering
incentives of individuals: an increase in Στ makes the default option damaging when Γ is small
because the importance of the information that individuals forego by exerting less effort to gather
it, (1 − Γ)Στ , is large relative to the precision of the information they learn from the default option,
ΓΣτ . Together, these comparative statics suggest venues in which default options are likely to add
value. For instance, default options are more likely to add value when there is little cross-sectional
variation in the population (e.g., healthy organ donations following lethal accidents) than when
this variation is higher (e.g., portfolio allocation problems).
By inspection of (10), the relationship between ∆W and Σg is non-monotonic. Similarly, our
analysis of (12) shows that ∆W is non-monotonically affected by changes in Γ. Based on this, it
is feasible that the government can optimize welfare by limiting its information collection to an
imperfect signal and by offering to the population a default option that is not perfectly correlated
with g̃. We explore this next.

2.2

Imperfect Government

One of Glaeser’s (2006) objections to the optimality of libertarian paternalism is that the government may, like individuals, make errors in judgement and decision making. For example, the
government might have limited precision when gathering information about its constituents. In
this case, default options reveal an imperfect, yet unbiased, signal about g̃.6 Alternatively, the government may gather perfect information about g̃, but wish to disclose an imperfect signal of their
information through a default option. Characterizing these issues is the purpose of this section.
Specifically, we first analyze what happens when the government observes g̃ imperfectly, and then
consider the government’s incentives to fully disclose g̃ even when it observes its value perfectly.
Suppose that the government only observes a noisy signal s̃ = g̃ + ǫ̃, where ǫ̃ is normally
distributed with mean zero and variance Σǫ , and is independent from g̃ and t̃i for all i ∈ I. As
before, each individual i can exert effort ei for a cost given by (2) and learns his type τi with
probability ei . If the government issues a default option that conveys its noisy signal, rational
6

Such mistakes might also result from a systematic bias in the government’s information gathering process. Of
course, since agents in our model are fully rational, they would correctly interpret the information contained in default
options and remove the effects of these systematic biases. With an unbiased, noisy signal about g̃, improving precision
is not possible but does induce individuals to employ more effort in acquiring their own information. Therefore, the
model as posed could include a systematic bias, but this would not change the economics of our results. Only if
individuals could not understand and adjust for the government’s biases would such mistakes change the analysis and
lead to lower welfare.

9

individuals will take this into account when choosing how much information to acquire and share.
We characterize this effect in the following proposition.
Proposition 3. If the government implements an imperfect default option with noise Σǫ , each
individual i chooses effort
ei =
where δ ≡

Σg
Σg +Σǫ .

(1 − δ)Σg + Σt
,
c

(14)

An individual i who observes a fully informative signal opts out of the default

option and chooses xi = τ̃i = g̃ + t̃i . An individual i who does not become informed chooses

xi = δs̃ = δ g̃ + ǫ̃ , the default option offered by the government.
As in Proposition 1, the optimal choice of effort is strictly decreasing in c and increasing in Σt

and Σg . Additionally, as the amount of noise in the default increases (higher Σǫ , and thus lower
δ), the higher is the effort that each individual is willing to exert to learn about τ̃i . Therefore,
the precision of information contained in the default option drives the incentives of individuals to
acquire information, which in turn affects how much is learned via information sharing.
Given Proposition 3, we can compute the total welfare with a noisy default option as

The next proposition compares welfare with and without a default option when the government’s
information is imperfect.
Proposition 4. The total welfare W N without a default option is higher than the total welfare
W D (Σǫ ) with a noisy default option if the cost parameter c is in the following region:

and Φ =

Σg
Σg +Σǫ .

Comparing the result in Proposition 4 with that in Proposition 2, the region in which no default
dominates default is larger when the government’s information is imprecise. In fact, Proposition 4
10

shows that this region gets larger as Σǫ increases (and Φ decreases). This result is not obvious: an
imprecise default hurts individuals who decide take the default option, but also provides incentives
for individuals to search more intensively, which improves information sharing. Comparison of
Propositions 2 and 4 shows that the first effect dominates the second, confirming Glaeser’s (2006)
conjecture that the case for libertarian paternalism is weaker if the government makes errors in
judgement or has imprecise information.
Clearly, this motivates an analysis of whether the government would optimally choose to issue
a noisy default, even when they have (or have free access to) perfect information about g̃. Thus
let us consider a broader action space for the government in which it can issue default options that
do not convey a precise signal regarding g̃. As such, the government could still choose to issue a
default option that conveys g̃ perfectly, but we now allow it to instead issue a default option that
conveys g̃ + ǫ̃, in which the government chooses the variance Σǫ > 0 of ǫ̃. If a finite Σǫ is chosen,
individuals can learn some (i.e., incomplete) information about their decision from the default. Of
course, as before, the government can still make the default option perfectly informative about
g̃ by choosing Σǫ = 0, and effectively refrain from making a default option available by choosing
Σǫ = ∞.
Given our previous discussion, the government’s choice of Σǫ affects welfare through two channels. A higher precision improves the choices that individuals make when they do not observe an
informative signal, but it decreases the incentives of individuals to collect and share information
in the first place. Taking these two forces into account, the next proposition characterizes the
government’s optimal default policy.
Proposition 5. The optimal choice of noisy default policy is given by
(
0,
if c > (Σg + 2Σt ) 1+α
2
Σ∗ǫ =
∞, otherwise.

(18)

Proposition 5 implies that our analysis in Section 2.1 holds even when we consider a broader
action space for the government. That is, the government’s decision is effectively binary: it either
chooses a fully informative default option or it offers no default whatsoever. Again, if the cost
of information acquisition is sufficiently high (high c), the size of the variation or value at risk is
sufficiently low (low Σg +Σt ), or the information sharing technology is sufficiently weak (low α), the
government issues a fully informative default option (i.e., Σǫ = 0). Otherwise, it lets individuals
fend for themselves (i.e., Σǫ = ∞).

Information Sales

So far, our model shows that the adoption of default options is costly and potentially suboptimal
when individuals in the economy can help each other learn about their own type. In this section,
we show that the externality need not be of the form specified in section 2. In particular, we show
that allowing individuals to sell their information to uninformed individuals can generate similar
results. That is, the presence of default options reduces the incentive for individuals to gather and
resell their information. This leads to an overall reduction of information in the economy and to
lower welfare.
To establish our results, we adapt the basic model of section 2 to a context in which some
individuals can (and will) purchase information from other individuals in the economy. More
specifically, we assume that a subset Iµ ∈ I, with γ(Iµ ) = µ, of individuals are skilled in the sense
that they can gather information about their type with the same technology as before; that is, for
a cost of C(ei ), individual i ∈ Iµ receives a signal that reveals his g̃ + t̃i with probability ei . To
emphasize the fact that externalities derive purely from information sales, we set α = 0 in (2),
so that C(ei ) = 2c e2i . The other individuals, j ∈ I \ Iµ , are unskilled in the sense that gathering
information about their own type is prohibitively costly.
Instead, these unskilled individuals can purchase information from skilled individuals. Although
everyone’s skill is publicly observable, the private information of any one skilled individual is not.
That is, no one can tell if individual i learned g̃ + t̃i or not. Thus, for a price p (to be determined
shortly), an unskilled individual j can purchase a signal from a skilled individual i, but does not
know if he learns g̃ + t̃i (which is correlated with his own type g̃ + t̃j ) or noise (which is not).7
Throughout this section, we go back to the assumption that the government’s default option is
perfect (i.e., equal to g̃) when it is made available; that is, we refrain from showing as in section 2.2
that this choice is optimal even if the government can choose the precision of its information. The
following lemma characterizes the value derived from the information by an unskilled individual
who consults a randomly selected skilled individual.
Lemma 3. If the government does not adopt a default option, the maximum amount that an
unskilled individual is willing to pay for the information sold by a randomly selected skilled individual
7

We assume that skilled individuals who do not learn their own type sell a randomly drawn number from a normal
distribution with a mean of zero and a variance of Σg + Σt , which makes it impossible for information buyers to tell
noise from real information.

(19)

If the government adopts a default option,

the maximum amount that an unskilled individual is willing to pay for the information sold by a
randomly selected skilled individual is
ν1 = ρ2 Σt ēµ = ρ2 (1 − Γ)Στ ē.

(20)

Unskilled individuals are willing to pay more to learn a skilled individual’s type when they
know that skilled individuals exert a lot of effort to learn their own type, i.e., ν0 and ν1 are both
increasing in ē. This makes sense as a fraction ēµ of the µ skilled individuals will be informed in
equilibrium, while the other 1 − ēµ skilled individuals sell useless noise. From (19) and (20), we
can also see that unskilled individuals are willing to pay a higher price for a skilled individual’s
information when their type is highly variable (large Στ ) and when it is more highly correlated
with that of other individuals (large ρ). This last result is consistent with the fact that, keeping Στ
fixed, ν0 is increasing in Γ, as types are more correlated when the common component g̃ accounts
for a larger portion of each individual’s type. This is also consistent with ν1 being decreasing in
Γ as, when the government announces g̃, the unknown portion of an individual’s type correlates
with someone else’s type only to the extent that the default option leaves uncertainty regarding t̃i .
In fact, using (19) and (20), it is straightforward to verify that ν0 > ν1 for a given total variance
Στ and aggregate level of effort ēµ . Indeed, because types are more correlated across individuals
when g̃ is unknown, it is the case that unskilled individuals are willing to pay more to learn a
skilled individual’s type when there is no default option offered by the government. As we shall see
below, this difference between ν0 and ν1 is exacerbated by the fact that the equilibrium effort level
of skilled individuals is greater in the absence of a default option.
The price that a skilled individual will end up charging for his information will in general
depend on how much competition he faces from other information sellers or, alternatively, on how
easy it is for unskilled traders to consult another skilled individual. To capture these possibilities
in a tractable manner, we assume that each unskilled individual meets with one randomly selected
skilled individual, and that the economic surplus from their transaction is split as a Nash bargaining
outcome. More specifically, we assume that a skilled individual charges p = θνδ , where θ ∈ [0, 1] and
δ = 1 if a default option is made available, for the information he sells to an unskilled individual.
When θ = 1 (θ = 0), the skilled (unskilled) individual extracts all the surplus from the transaction.
13

Setting θ ∈ (0, 1) allows us to capture any intermediate market power scenario. As the following
analysis shows, our results are unaffected by the size of θ, as money exchanges between individuals
cancel out in the total welfare function that the government seeks to maximize. We start with the
following result, which describes the equilibrium in the absence of a default option.
Proposition 6. If the government does not adopt a default option, then each skilled individual i ∈
Iµ chooses an effort level ei =

xj =

Σg + ρΣt
ēµ s̃j = Γ + ρ(1 − Γ) ēµ s̃j .
Σg + Σt

(21)

The skilled individuals’ behavior is the same as in section 2.1. In particular, their behavior
is not affected by the possibility of reselling their information to unskilled agents. This is due
to the fact that unskilled agents cannot distinguish between skilled individuals who learn their
type and skilled individuals who do not. That is, they pay θν0 to the one skilled individual they
encounter, informed or not. As we see from (21), the extent to which unskilled individuals rely
on the information they purchase depends on its correlation with their type, as increases in ρ, Γ
and ēµ all ultimately lead to a higher correlation between s̃j and τ̃j . The following result is the
analogue of Proposition 6 when the government makes a default option g̃ available.
Proposition 7. If the government adopts a default option, then each skilled individual i ∈ Iµ
chooses an effort level ei =

Σt
c

=

(1−Γ)Στ
c

, and chooses xi = τ̃i or xi = g̃, depending on whether or

not he observes τ̃i . Each unskilled individual j ∈ I \ Iµ purchases a signal s̃j = τ̃ı̃ from a randomly
selected skilled individual ı̃ ∈ Iµ for a price p = θν1 , with ν1 given by (20), and chooses
xj = g̃ + ρēµ (s̃j − g̃).

(22)

The comparative statics on the individuals’ choices with respect to Στ , ρ and ēµ are similar to
those in Proposition 6: more risk (large Στ ) leads to more effort, and more correlation (large ρ and
ēµ ) leads to heavier reliance on purchased information. When Γ is large, skilled individuals do not
gain much from learning their type perfectly, as the default option already reveals a large portion
of their type. As such, they work less. Although Γ affects the information price (through ν1 , as
shown in Lemma 3), it does not affect the weight that unskilled individuals put on the information
they acquire from skilled individuals. Instead, they use the default option to remove the common
component included in the signal and only place weight on the idiosyncratic component. Finally,
14

note that as in Proposition 1, the skilled individuals exert a higher level of effort in the absence of a
default option since the incentive to gather information is stronger when they do not have a default
option to fall back on. This in turn causes the quality of their advice to decrease, and further
amplifies the previously discussed difference between ν0 and ν1 . That is, unskilled individuals do
not benefit as much from a skilled individual’s information, and are thus inclined to pay less for it.
As in section 2, to assess the pros and cons of the government’s default option, we compare
total welfare with and without this option. In this case, welfare must be aggregated between skilled
and unskilled individuals. This is done in the following lemma.
Lemma 4. The total welfare without a default option is
W N = −(Σg + Σt ) +

The total welfare with a default option is

(24)

In section 2, an increase in α enhances overall welfare through the larger information gathering
externalities that individuals have on each other. We can now see from (23) and (24) that increases
in ρ have a similar effect in the presence of information sales. More precisely, straightforward
differentiation of these two expressions with respect to ρ lead to

and

That is, a larger correlation across individuals’ types leads to more welfare when an advice channel,
like information sales, is incorporated. We can also see that the increase in welfare accommodated
by this advice channel is more important when a sizeable fraction of the population is unskilled (i.e.,
1 − µ is large). Finally, it is clear that (25) is greater than (26): the advice channel is more crucial,
and the role of ρ greater, when the government refrains from making a default option available, as
unskilled individuals can then rely only on the skilled agents’ information for their decisions.
The next proposition, which is our last result, is the analogue of Proposition 2 when we allow
for information sales.

15

Proposition 8. The total welfare W N without a default option is higher than the total welfare W D
with a default option if the cost parameter c is in the following region:

(28)

As mentioned above, the role of ρ plays an especially important welfare role in information
sales when the government does not make a default option available. Proposition 8 formalizes
this by showing that ρ ≤

1
2

always makes the availability of a default option optimal. That is,

unskilled individuals are better off learning the common component of their type perfectly from
the government when the information that can be acquired from other agents is not all that useful.
This implies that default options are especially valuable when the needs of an individual are unlikely
to be similar to those of his peers, including the ones who can advise him.
We can also see from (28) that default options are less valuable when Σt is large and Σg is
small, which is similar to our findings in section 2. The extent to which the government can
resolve the uncertainty faced by the population is still an important determinant of the usefulness
of default option. Interestingly, however, default options are more valuable when a larger fraction
of the population is skilled (large µ), even when ρ is large. This arises because the information
externalities that skilled individuals bring to the economy through information sales is limited: the
small number of unskilled individuals leads to a small number of information sales, and so the effort
choices of skilled agents with and without a default option (as derived in Proposition 7) do not lead
to significantly different externalities.8

Concluding Remarks

Libertarian paternalism is an alluring idea because it combines two policies that appear incompatible at first glance, but work well together in many economic settings. However, one needs to be
cautious when implementing the ideals of such a policy in practice. As we show in our analysis, it
is not necessarily the paternalistic partner in this union that causes problems in the relationship.
8

Note that an effort cost function that includes, as in (2), an externality component in the information acquisition
process of the skilled individuals would mitigate this result. Indeed, α > 0 would lead to both skilled and unskilled
benefitting from a more concerted information acquisition effort.

16

Rather, the freedom that participants exercise in the market may lead to side effects that decrease
social welfare.
Indeed, as its name suggests, libertarian paternalism preserves the rights of individuals to
act in their own best interest, free-ride on each other’s effort provision, and shirk in their own
responsibilities. In the face of non-cooperative incentives, libertarian paternalism may induce or
worsen externalities that decrease welfare, even though it does not explicitly force people to act in
a prescribed manner.
In the paper, we analyze a theoretical model to characterize one such distortion: information
acquisition and social learning. As Madrian and Shea (2001) demonstrate, default options have
information content, which participants may take into consideration when making key decisions.
Importantly, this may affect incentives to gather further information, which in turn may alter the
success of information aggregation, either through social learning or information sales in the market.
We explore when libertarian paternalism is more or less likely to add value given this externality.
We show that default options are more likely to improve social welfare when acquiring information
is costly, information is not easily shared across individuals, and people are more heterogeneous in
their attributes or needs. Based on our model, default options will likely decrease welfare when the
government knows less about its constituents, when people are heterogeneous, and when the value
at stake in the decision is large.
Our analysis adds to previous work by Carroll et al. (2008) and increases our understanding of
default options and the implementation of libertarian paternalism through public recommendations
and advice. Further study of the externalities induced by libertarian paternalism are the subject
of future research, which appears warranted given the potential welfare import of this policy.

If c > (1 + α)(Σg + Σt ), this derivative is always negative and it is optimal to set Σǫ as low as
possible, that is, Σ∗ǫ = 0. If c < (1 + α)Σt , the above derivative is always positive and it is therefore
optimal to set Σǫ as high as possible, that is Σ∗ǫ = ∞, which is equivalent to the government not
offering a default option. Finally, if (1 + α)Σt < c < (1 + α)(Σg + Σt ), then (29) is greater than
zero when

and smaller than zero otherwise. This means that the maximum can only be achieved at Σǫ = 0

must therefore be the same as in Proposition 2, leading to (18).

Proof of Lemma 3
Let s̃j denote the information purchased by unskilled individual j from skilled individual i, and
let us first consider the case in which the government does not make a default option available. If
s̃j = g̃ + t̃i , then the reduction in variance experienced by individual j from knowing s̃j is given by

where we use the projection theorem to calculate the expression in square brackets. If s̃j is pure

noise, then individual j does not experience a reduction in variance. Since a fraction ēµ of the skilled
traders learn their type, the unconditional reduction in variance experienced by individual j from


(Σ +ρΣ )2
learning individual i’s information is Σg g +Σtt ēµ , which can be rewritten as Γ + ρ(1 − Γ) Στ ēµ
using the fact that Σg = ΓΣτ and Σt = (1 − Γ)Στ . Since this quantity represents the increase in
expected utility enjoyed by individual j as a result of knowing s̃j , this is the maximum price that
he is willing to pay for it. The case in which the government makes a default option available is
similarly derived. 

Proof of Proposition 6
Let π̃i denote the profits that a skilled individual i ∈ Iµ generates from selling information to
unskilled individuals. With an information price p = θν0 , the 1 − µ unskilled individuals will pay
a total sum of (1 − µ)p = (1 − µ)θν0 to acquire signals from the µ skilled agents. Since these
skilled agents are randomly selected, the expected profits from information sales of any one skilled
individual i are
