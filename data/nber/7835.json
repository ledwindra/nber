    "abstract": "\n\nWe develop a model of optimal investment with two types of agents with different beliefs about the market dynamics.  Market conformists agree with the true log-normal price distribution and rebels believe in price predictability.  Depending on their exact beliefs, the rebels may follow either a momentum or a contrarian strategy.  It is difficult to detect rebels' beliefs that are not far-fetched from the market perspective.  The long-run investment portfolios of both conformist and rebels need not be biased towards equities.\n\n",
