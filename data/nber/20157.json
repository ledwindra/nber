    "abstract": "\n\nWe study the wealth distribution in Bewley economies with idiosyncratic capital income risk. We show analytically that under rather general conditions on the stochastic structure of the economy, a unique ergodic distribution of wealth displays a fat tail; more precisely, a Pareto distribution in the right tail.\n\n",
