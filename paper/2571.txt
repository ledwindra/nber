Investment, Depreciation and Capital Utilization

ABSTRACT

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the determinants of capital
durability and utilization and their interdependence with investment

decisions. The approach is based on the view that the flow of undepreciated
capital is an output to be used in future production. At each date capital
and non-capital inputs are combined to produce current output and the capital

inputs to be used for future production. Thus capital accumulation occurs in
a joint product context as two kinds of output are produced, one type for
current sale and one type for future production.

Another issue investigated in this paper concerns the allocation of
resources within a firm between installing and utilizing capital and labor

training activities. Often this problem is ignored in the theory of
investment, not only because depreciation is exogenous, but also due to the

treatment of labor as a variable factor of production. However, it is well
recognized that firms cannot costlessly adjust labor. Thus the second purpose
of this paper is to analyze the intertemporal relationship between the
durability of capital and the growth rate of labor.

1. Introduction

The analysis of investment has generally ignored the
interdependence between capital depreciation, utilization, and
accumulation. Utilization is usually assumed to be costless (and hence

there is no incentive for a firm to retain idle capital), while
depreciation is often assumed to be constant. Recently, investment
theory has been extended to account for costly utilization. A. Abel
[1981] and J. Bernstein [1983] have characterized the determination of
utilization by the trade-off between output expansion and a higher wage

bill.' In this framework, the wage rate varies with the utilization
rate, but decisions on capital utilization were not forward looking or

did not involve an intertemporal dimension because depreciation was
assumed to be constant.

In other words, the lifetime of capital was

unaffected by the rate at which the factor was utilized.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the determinants of
capital depreciation and utilization and their interdpendence with
investment decisions. Research on depreciation and utilization by K.
Smith (1970), P. Taubman and H. Wilkinson (1970) and W. Oi (1981) has
emphasized the dependence of depreciation on the utilization rate. This
rate was determined by balancing the increase in current output against

the increase in depreciations costs. However, decisions affecting

capital depreciation influence not only current but also future
production through their effect on investment demand.

In this paper we

also incorporate into the theory of investment a more general view of

-2-

capital utilization. The approach, first developed by J. Hicks (1946),
E. Malinvaud (1953), and later by C. Bliss (1975) and E. Diewert (1980),
characterizes the flow of undepreciated capital as a current output to be

used as an input in the future. At each date, capital and non-capital
inputs are combined to produce current output and the capital inputs to

be used for future production. Thus capital accumulation occurs tn a
joint product context, as two kinds of output are produced: one type for

current sale and one type for future production. Epstein and Denny
(1980) estimated a short-run model incorporating undepreciated capital as

an output. Their interest was in the estimation of short-run factor

demand and output supply functions and not with the dynamics and
comparative dynamics associated with choices relating to capital
depreciation, utilization, and accumulation.

The second major purpose of this paper is to model the stylized

facts obtained by M. Foss (1981) and the estimation results due to MI.

Nadiri and S. Rosen (1969). First, Foss found that, as the wage rate
increased, the rate of capital utilization increased while the growth
rates of capital and labor declined. Second, as product demand grew the

growth rates of capital and labor along with the rate of utilization

increased. Third, Nadiri and Rosen estimated that the capital
utilization rate exhibited a dynamic adjustment process. They found that

the utilization rate not only interacts with the rates of capital and

labor accumulation but can indeed be characterized by a flexible
accelerator adjustment process. This process was the same type as
estimated for capital and labor investment. In this model these three
results are established. The rate of capital utilization adjustment is

-3-

governed by a flexible accelerator. In response to unanticipated supply
side shocks, which relate to changes in wage and interest rates, there is
counter movement between the utilization rate on the one side and capital

and labor growth rates on the other side. As unanticipated demand side
shocks occur, there is comovement in the rates of utilization, capital
and labor investment. Moreover, these results are obtained in this model
both in long-run equilibrium and along the dynamic adjustment path.

In Section 2 of this paper the model is developed and the nature

of the short-run equilibrium is established. The dynamic properties and

the steady state are analyzed in the third section. In part 4 the

comparative steady state and dynamic results are obtained for
unanticipated changes in product demand and input supply conditions.
Lastly, we summarize and conclude the paper.

2. The Model and Short-Run Equilibrium

A production process is represented by

y(t) —

(1)

F(K5(t),

L(t), 1(0(t))

where y(t) is the output quantity, 1(5(t) and L(t) are the quantities
is the quantity of

of the capital and labor inputs respectively, 1(0(t)

the capital output, F is the twice continuously differentiable function

which is homogeneous of degree one, with positive anddiminishing
marginal products in the two inputs while increases in the capital output

decrease output at a decreasing rate. Thus

F < 0,

FLL

< 0,

FN >

0,

FL >

0,

F0 <

0,

F < 0.

The inputs K.d(t)

and

products y(t) and I<0(t).

L(t)

are combined to produce the joint

The former output is produced for current

sale and the latter is to be used for future production. The variable
y(t) can be referred to as the final product or output in the current
period, while 1<0(t) represents an intermediate product which is used in
production in the next period. The endogeneity of capital utilization is

captured indirectly through the selection of the capital output.

The

choice regarding capital available for future production reflects
decisions on the utilization and also the maintenance or reparation of
the capital input in current production. The specific process delimiting

utilization and reparation is embedded or internal to the production
process and is captured by the production function.

-5-

There are two ways in which capital becomes available for future

production: internal investment (which is nonutilization or reparation)

and external investment (acquisition). This implies that capital
accumulates according to

KN(t) —

(2)

where 15(t)

15(t)

+ I(0(t) -

K(t),

KN(O)

— K; >0

is gross investment in capital. Equation (2) generalizes

the standard formulation of capital accumulation. This can be seen by

noting that the depreciation rate is

(I(5(t) -

Thus, equation (2) can be rewritten as I(t)

—

K0(t))/K5(t) — 8(t).

I5(t)

-

&(t)K(t).

If

8(t) is time invariant and exogenous, then depreciation occurs in the
usual manner. The depreciation rate represents the net outcome

regarding

the implied decisions on the capital utilization and reparation rates.
In this model it is assumed that capital output is nonnegative and does

not exceed the capital input. Hence 0

8(t)

1, which implies that

the reparation rate never exceeds the utilization rate. The depreciation

rate can thereby be considered as synonymous with the net utilization
rate.

The definition of 8(t) enables the production function to be
written as y(t) —

F[K5(t),L(t),(1-8(t))g(t)J

where 6(t)K5(t)

is the

depreciated or net utilized capital. In this model, following Nadiri and

Rosen (1969), and Taubman and Wilkinson (1970), it is assumed that the

marginal product of capital (FN > 0) is not necessarily equal to the
marginal product of utilized capital (-F0 >0).2

-6-

As emphasized by Oi (1962), Nadiri and Rosen (1969), Abel (1981)

and Zernstein (1983), labor is also treated as a quasi-fixed factor in

this model, but because the focus is on capital utilization and
depreciation, we assume that

L(t) —

(3)

IL(t)

-

pL(t),

L(O) — L° > 0.

IL(t) is gross investment in labor, and 0

p

I is the fixed rate of

labor departure, reflecting in a simple way quits, retirements, firings,
and layoffs.3

The distinction between capital stock and flow decisions can be

noted from equations (1) and (2). At any time, the capital stock to be

used in current production is predetermined. This means that there
exists a given bundle of capital services which is embedded in the stock
of capital. The flow of services from the capital stock actually used or

capital utilization is selected and combined with labor services to
produce current output. The choice on utilization is captured indirectly

through the decision on the capital output or the flow of capital
services available for production in the next period.

The additions to

the stock of capital consist of newly acquired capital (or gross
investment) and the difference between the stock of capital available for

future production and the amount that was available for current
production.

There are adjustment Costs associated with the quasi-fixed
factors, which are internal to and separable from the production process

-7-

(see R. Lucas (1967), J. Gould (1968), A. Treadway (1971), D. Mortensen

(1973) and L. Epstein (1982)).

These costs affect the flow of funds

which can be represented as

(4)

V(t) —

p(t)y(t)

-

w(t)L(t)

-

C(I5(t)/K.5(t))15(t)

-

D(IL(t)/L(t))IL(t)

where V(t) is the flow of funds, p(t) is the product price, w(t) is
the wage for labor, C is the twice-continuously differentiable unit
capital adjustment cost function with C(O) —

IN(t) > 0 and p5(t)

p(t)

C' > 0 for

is the exogenous purchase price of capital. In

addition, total capital adjustment costs are strictly convex in I(t).
The unit labor adjustment cost function, D, has the same properties as

the unit capital adjustment cost function except D(0) —

0.

The

adjustment costs for capital and labor are internal but separable from
the production technology and arise from the installation of capital and
labor into the production process.4

The objective is to maximize the present value of the flow of
funds, which is discounted by the interest rate r, subject to equations
(l)-(3).

Capital output and gross investment in capital and labor are

selected in order to carry out this program.5 The Hamiltonian is

To understand the implications of the equilibrium conditions,
consider the short run or temporary equilibrium.6 This equilibrium is

defined for given k, q1 and q2, by equations (6.l)-(6.3). First
equation (6.1) shows the determination of the allocation of the given
stocks of capital and labor between current output and capital output.

This is illustrated in (K0,y) space in Figure 1. The slope of the

product transformation curve is f2 < 0, and since f

is strictly

concave, the curve is also strictly concave. The slope of the isorevenue

line in Figure 1 is -q1/p. Given p, q1, K5, and L equation (6.1)
represents the condition for short-run revenue maximization by choosing

y and I( subject to the technology.' The trade-off is between current

output and future output, manifested by the stock of unused capital
available for future production. In equilibrium the relative marginal
cost (-f2) is equal to the relative product price

(q1/p). More@ver,

since the equilibrium magnitudes depend on the shadow price

q1, the

allocation decision is forward looking, as this price equals the present

value of the marginal benefits from installed capital or capital
available for future production. This means that the utilization of
capital embodied in the selection of

is an investment decision.

Alternatively, equation (6.1) can be viewed as the short run

solution for the depreciation or the net utilization rate 6, which
depends on the capital intensity, the product price and the price of
installed or unutilized capital. For an increase in q1, the marginal

value of unutilized capital rises, and as a consequence, the net
utilization rate falls. This, of course, implies that current output
decreases. The converse occurs for an increase in the product price p.8

Lastly, an increase in the capital intensity generates the following
effect on 6, from equation (6.1),

(7)

86/8k —

(f21 + f22(6))/f221<.

The sign of the right side of (7) depends on f21, since

assumed that f21

f22 < 0. It is

0. The reasonableness of this aaaumption can be

noted from -f1/f2 > 0 which is the marginal product of capital in the

-11-

production of capital for future use. Generally it is assumed that
marginal products diminish. Therefore it is assumed that as the capital

input (K5) increases, the marginal product of capital decreases in the
production of the capital output (K0). A sufficient condition for this

marginal product to dininish is that f21

0.

Hence the right side of

(7) is positive.9

Summarizing the results from (6.1),

(8)

6 — r(k,

q1, p),

r1 > 0, I' < 0,

I'3 > 0.

The gross investment decisions for both capital and labor are

forward looking. From (6.2) an increase in the marginal value of
capital investment raises the rate of capital investment,

(9)

15/K5 — X.5(q1),

X., —

l/(C"(15/K5) + 2C') >. 0.

Similarly for labor investment,

(10)

IL/L — )C1(q2),

X — l/(D"(IL/L) + 2D') > 0.

The firm utilizes and invests in capital until the marginal cost
of producing capital output through reparation (or nonutilization) equals

the marginal cost of purchasing and installing capital (see equations
(6.1) and (6.2)). The equality between these marginal costs points out
that there are indeed two forms of capital investment in this model. One

type of investment can be considered internal through reparation (or

-12-

nonutilization) and the other can be considered external through
acquisition.

3. The Dynamics and the Steady State

Capital and labor are accumulated so that dynamic behav,or occurs

in this model. The purpose of this section is to characterize the
dynamic adjustment paths of the rates of capital and labor investment
along with the path of the capital utilization rate.

First the capJtal

intensity growth rate is determined by substituting equations (8)-(lO)
into (6.4) so that,

(11)

k/k — X.(q1)

-

r(k,q1,p)

-

X(q2)

+

i.

The capital intensity growth rate depends on the investment shadow prices

and, unlike the situation with exogenous capital depreciation, also
depends on the capital intensity itself. The growth rate is a decreasing

function of the capital intensity because as the latter increases,
diminishing marginal productivities of labor and capital cause there to
be less of a need for further increases in the capital intensity. Thus

(12.1)

8(k/k)/3k —

-r1

< 0.

An increase in the marginal value of capital leads to more capital
investment (both internal and external), thereby causing an increase in
the capital intensity growth rate by

(12.2)

3(1/k)/3q1 —

X.

> 0.

-

-14-

Lastly, since an increase in the marginal value of labor investment
increases the labor growth rate, then the capital intensity growth rate
decreases by

3(k/k)/3q2 —

(12.3)

Because

<

0.

the capital intensity is changing through time, the

marginal values of capital and labor investment exhibit intertemporal

movement. Substituting equations (8) and (9) into (6.5), the dynamic
path of the price of installed or unutilized capital is given by

(13) 4 — (r

r(k,

p(f1(k,

r(k,q1,p))f2(k,

(l-F(k,q1,p))k)

(1 -

r(k,q1p))k)

From (13) it can be seen that the capital stock is chosen such that the
opportunity cost of funds or the interest rate equals the rate of return

on capital. The latter consists of three elements: the value of the

marginal product of capital net of depreciation, the decline in
installation costs arising from having a larger stock of capital and
capital gains associated with the installed capital.

When the price of installed or unutilized capital increases, a
capital gain must occur in order to keep the rate of return on capital
equal to the interest rate. Indeed,

-15-

(14.1)

a41/aq1 —

r+6

+

pkr2(f12 + (l-6)f22)

I/K5 > 0.

The right side of (14.1) is positive because r+6 > IN/KM in order for
the flow of funds to be finite and pkr2(f12 +

(l-6)f22)

> 0.

An increase in the capital intensity causes a decrease im the
value of the marginal product of capital. To retain the equality between

the interest rate and rate of return, a capital gain must occur.

Thus

differentiating (13) with respect to the capital intensity and making use
of equation (7) yields

81/8k — -p(f1f22

(14.2)

-

0.

Next, consider the path of the price of integrating labor in the
production process.

-

-

f1(k,l-F(k,q1,p))k)k
D'(X(q2))(X2(q2))2 +

The interest rate is equated to the rate of return on labor. The latter
consists of three elements: the value of the marginal product of labor

net of departures, the reduction in adjustment costs due to a larger

labor force, and the capital gains net of the wage rate paid to the
workers.

-16-

In order to retain the equilibrium condition (15) when the price

of integrating labor increases, a capital gain must accrue and when the
capital intensity increases, a capital loss must occur. Thus

842/8q2 —

r+p

>0

-

and

(16.2)

a42/ak —

pk(f11f22

-

f2)/f22

<

0.

Moreover, the price of integrating labor depends on the price of
installed or unutilized capital since the marginal product of labor is

affected by capital utilization. Differentiating (15) with respect to
the price of unutilized capital yields

(16.3)

842/0q1 —

-pk2r2(f12 + f22(l-5))

<

0.

An increase in the price of unutilized capital lowers the depreciation
rate and thereby increases the marginal product of labor. In order for

the interest rate to remain equal to the rate of return on labor, a
capital loss must occur.

The properties of the time paths of the capital intensity and the

prices of unutilized capital and integrating labor have been analyzed.
Hence the dynamic path and long-run equilibrium can now be characterized.

The long-run equilibrium or steady state, defined for tc —

locus in (q1,k)

steady state value of q2 which is q. Similarly, k —

consistent with the steady state capital intensity, k. Secondthe
curves must be drawn such that their intersections form a rectangle. The
two properties together, one relating to the position of each locus, and

the other to the position of the intersections, permit the illustration
of the steady State.

Not only does the steady state exist (from the properties of the

production and adjustment cost functions), but it is unique. Uniqueness

can be demonstrated from Figure 3. Suppose point A represents another

steady state value of q1, q. By construction, q >

in the (q2,q1) quadrant of Figure 2.

To understand the intuition behind these results, consider an

initial situation with insufficient integrated labor relative to
installed (or unutilized) capital

(k° > k').

The marginal value of the

integrated labor force in the production process must exceed the long-run

magnitude (q > q), in order for the firm to increase its labor
force. Simultaneously, the marginal value of installed or unutilized

capital is below the steady state value (q < q) so the firm has
less incentive to accumulate capital either through acquisition or
reparation (non-utilization).

The results on the prices for unutilized capital and integrated
labor imply (from equations (9) and (10)) that (I5/K.)° < (I5/K.)

and

(IL/L)° > (I/L). Since the capital intensity decreases to the steady
state, the rate of labor investment must exceed the steady state rate,
while the converse must occur for the capital investment rate.

The behavior of the depreciation or the net utilization rate is

governed by the movements over time of the capital intensity and the
price of unutilized capital (from equation (8)). By time differentiating

-24-

equation (8) and using equations (19.1) and (19.2), the adjustment path
of the net utilization rate is

(19.4)

—

[(r1(A-a22) +

Thus the adjustment path for the capital utilization rate is a fleKhle
accelerator.

This result rigorously establishes the empirical finding

obtained by Nadiri and Rosen (1969) that the adjustment' path of the
capital utilization rate is similar to the paths of capital and labor

growth rates which are governed by flexible accelerators. Along the
dynamic path, as the capital intensity decreases the net utilization rate

declines for two reasons. First, there is the direct effect of the
capital intensity on the net utilization rate. A decrease in the capital

intensity leads the firm to reallocate resources towards capital output
which decreases the rate.

Second, there is the indirect effect, which

arises because the decrease in capital intensity causes the price of
unutilized capital to increase. Since the marginal value of unutilized
capital increases, the firm then utilizes less of its capital and so the

utilization rate falls. Thus

lc° >

k'

implies that 6° >

6'.

These

results mean that along the dynamic path the net capital utilization rate

and the rate of capital investment are inversely related while the net

capital utilization rate and the labor investment rate are directly
correlated.

4. Comoarative SteadY State and Dynamics

This section is concerned with the analysis of the effects of
unanticipated changes in input supply and product demand conditions on
the steady state and dynamic adjustment path. The stable adjustment path

can be obtained from equation sets (18) and (19) and it can be writt as

Clearly, in order to determine the effects of unanti-

cipated shocks to the dynamic adjustment path, the effects on the steady

state must be derived. These results are presented in Table 1 and they

will be discussed as we consider each shock to the dynamic adjustment
path. The expressions in Table 1 were determined from equations (11),

and then differentiating the three equations with respect to

the wage rate, interest rate, departure rate and product price.

To begin the analysis, from euation (20.1) it is clear that
unanticipated changes in the wage rate, interest rate, departure rate,
and product price cause the capital intensity to change along the path in

a direct and proportional manner to the steady state capital intensity.
From the first column of Table 1, the latter increases in response to a

higher wage rate.

The capital intensity increases in the long-run

thereby along the adjustment path because the higher wage causes labor to

be relatively more expensive than capital. The result on the capital
intensity is not as clear when the interest rate rises. An increase in

the interest rate causes the rates of return on capital and labor to
rise. This means that the prices of installed or unutilized capital and

of integrating labor must fall.

However, as both prices fall,' the

capital intensity responds in an ambiguous manner because both the
capital and labor rates of investment decline. Next an increase in the
labor departure rate causes the capital intensity to increase because the

higher departure rate decreases the labor growth rate. Lastly, an
unanticipated rise in product demand which is reflected as an thcrease in
the product price generates an ambiguous effect on the capital intensity.

The reason is that the higher product price increases the value of the
marginal products of capital and labor and thereby their rates of return.

In order to restore long-run equilibrium, the prices of installed or
unutilized capital and of integrating labor must increase.

These price

rises, in turn, cause the rates of labor and capital investment to
increase and therefore there is an ambiguous effect on the capital
intensity.

In order to determine the effects of unanticipated product demand

and factor supply shocks on the rates of capital and labor investment and
the depreciation rate or the net rate of capital utilization, the results

presented in Table 1 and equation (20.2) must be combined. First, for an

increase in the wage rate using the first row of Table 1 and the values
of

and a2,

An increase in the wage rate decreases the price of installed capital
along the dynamic path but not by as much as the decrease in the sleady

state price of installed capital. However, along the dynamic path not
only does the price of integrated labor decrease but the decrease exceeds
that obtained in the steady state.

The results from (21.1) and (21.2) together with the investment
demand functions defined by equations (9) and (10) imply that the rate of

capital investment declines along the dynamic path in response to an
increase in the wage rate but not by as much as the steady state capital

investment rate decreases. The labor investment rate also decreases
along the adjustment path, but the decrease exceeds the steady state
decline in the rate of labor investment as the wage rate increases.

The dynamic path of the net capital utilization rate is also
affected by the wage rate. Using equation (8), the results in Table 1
and (21.1),

(21.3)

0 < 86/8w

—

r2(3q/aw)A/(A

-

a22)

< r23q/aw

< 35°/8w.

Thus an Increase in the wage rate increases the net capital utilization
rate but the increase in the rate is not as great as the increase in the

steady state rate. These results establish that along the adjustment

-29-

path increases in the wage rate cause the rates of capital and labor
investment to move in the opposite direction to the utilization rate.

Next, for an increase in the interest rate the price of installed

or unutilized capital and the price of integrating labor decrease along
the dynamic adjustment path to the lower steady state price. This result
can be obtained from the second row of Table 1, equation (20.2), an& the

value of

The sign of the right side of equations (22.1) and (22.2) imply
that the rates of capital and labor investment decline in response to an

unanticipated change in the interest rate along the dynamic path. In
addition, from (22.1) and equation (8) an increase in the interest rate

causes the capital utilization rate to increase since the price of
unutilized capital falls along the adjustment path. Thus, as for the
wage rate, an unanticipated increase in the interest rate causes the

counter movement along the adjustment path between the capital
utilization rate and the rates of capital and labor investment.

If there is an unanticipated increase in the rate of labor
departures, then from equation (20.2), the third row of Table 1 and the

value of

However, unlike the price of installed capital, there is an ambiguous
effect on the price of integrating labor along the adjustment path for an

increase in the labor departure rate.13 The ambiguity arises becaus the
increase in the departure rate decreases the rate of return on labor and

simultaneously decreases the capital intensity and the price of
unutilized capital. The latter two effects serve to increase the rate of

return on labor. Therefore, although the rate of capital investment
decreases along the path in response to an increase in the, departure

rate, and in addition, this decrease is less than that found in the
steady state, it is not possible to unambiguously determine the effect on
the path of labor investment.

Increases in the labor departure rate cause the net capital

utilization rate to increase. Thus, there is a direct relationship
between the two rates. Moreover, the movement in the capital utilization

rate in the steady state is more pronounced than that found 4long the
adjustment path. Indeed, from equations (8) and (23.1)

(23.2)

0 < 86/8p — r28q/8(A/(A-a22)) < r23q/a,i <

36/8js.

Turning to the product demand shocks, suppose that the firm is

confronted with an unanticipated increase in product demand along the
dynamic adjustment path. This increase implies that there is an increase

in the product price. The increase in the product price generates an

-31-

increase in the price of installed capital such that from (20.2) and the
fourth row of Table 1,

In addition, the price of integrating labor increases along the path for
an

increase in the product price,

Thus the prices of installed capital and of integrating labor move in the

same direction along the adjustment path. These results also imply that

the rates of investment in capital and labor increase and move in the
same direction.

There is also a tendency for the capital utilization rate to
increase in response to changing product demand conditions. The effect
on the net capital utilization rate (using (8) and (24.1)) can be seen
from

price will increase capital utilization if the rate of capital investment

is relatively more inelastic with respect to the product price compared

to the price of unutilized capital. In this situation, the increase in

product demand will cause relatively more resources to be devoted to
capital utilization and thereby current output will rise compared to
capital investment and future output.

To summarize the results, the present model is able to capture

the stylized facts of Foss (1981) .

Unanticipated

changes in factor

supply conditions generate movements in the rates of capital and labor

investment in the same direction. These rates generally decrease. The
capital utilization rate increases in response to changes in the supply
side conditions and thereby moves in the opposite direction to the rates

of investment. Unanticipated changes in product demand conditions,
however, cause both rates of investment to increase and there is also the

possibility for the capital utilization rate to increase. Thus, unlike

changes in the supply side conditions, changes in product demand
conditions can generate comovement in all three variables.

5. Conclusion

A model of investment and capital utilization was developed in

this paper.

The problem of capital utilization was considered in a

context of joint products as current output and capital output ware
determined given the stocks of the quasi-fixed factora.

In additton,

since capital output forms part of the accumulation process, there were
two types of capital investment: internal investment through reparation
(or non-utilization) and external investment through acquisition.

In the present model, capital utilization is a forward-looking
decision.

Capital is utilized and investment occurs until the marginal

cost of capital utilization equals the marginal cost of installed
capital. The intertemporal nature of the equilibrium arises because the
marginal costs of capital utilization and capital installation each equal

the present value of the marginal benefits from capital. Hence the
decision on capital utilization can be viewed as a trade-off between
current and future output production.

A significant feature of the model is that the dynamic adjustment

path can be characterized along with the effects on the rates of capital

and labor investment and capital utilization from unanticipated changes
in factor supply and product demand conditions. It was established that

the path of the capital utilization rate can be characterized as a
flexible accelerator and is similar in nature to the paths for the rates

of capital and labor investment. This result captures the empirical
finding of Nadiri and Rosen (1969). Along the adjustment patl the rates

of investment are inversely related to each other while the capital

-34-

utilization rate is directly related to the rate of labor inveatment and
inversely related to the capital investment rate. In addition, the model

captures the stylized facts obtained by Foss (1981) .

Unanticipsted

changes in factor supply conditions (as represented by changes in the
wage rate, interest rate and labor departure rate) caused comoversent in
the rates of capital and labor investment, while the capital utilizfrtion

rate was inversely related to the rates of investment. This model was

also able to capture the feature that unanticipated product demand
changes generated comovement in all three variables along the dynamic
adjustment path.

These models were based on the work of Lucas (1970), Winston and McCoy

(1974), and Betancourt and Clague (1978), who focused on rhythmic factor
prices (e.g., overtime wage rates) as the costs associated with capital
utilization.

If as a special case F5 — -F0, so the marginal product of the capital
input equals the marginal product of utilized capital, then y(t) —

F(6(t)K.0(t),

L(t)). This special case is the way capital utilization is often

introduced into the production function. Here it is clearly seen that (t)
is the net utilization rate.

The results from this model can be generalized to a situation where there

are two

labor

inputs, with one treated as a variable factor of production and

the other as a quasi-fixed factor. Also the results apply to the special case
where labor is only a variable input.
The unit adjustment cost function C(15(t)/K.,q(t)) is composed of the

purchase price and the internal cost of installing capital. Thus

C(I5(t)/K5(t)) —

then C(0) —

p5(t) + A(15(t)/K5(t)).

Also A' > 0

for 15(t) > 0

Finally, we assume that the total capital adjustment cost,
-36-

so C' >

A(I5(t)/K.5(t))I5(t), is strictly convex in 15(t). We do not assume that unit

installation costs are strictly convex. This implies that C"IN(t)K.(t) + 2C'

> 0. Since C' > 0 then C" can be negative but not too negative.

We drop the notation (t) for simplicity. In addition, K, I and I are
piecewise continuous functions of time, while

functions with piecewise continuous first derivatives.

It

is important to recognize that the two capital investment elasticities

determining the sign of the right side of equation (24.3) do have empirical

content. The model in this paper is consistent with the set of investment
models under the generic name "q-model". Indeed, our model can be considered
a q-model of investment and capital utilization. Various versions of the qmodel of investment have been estimated (see for example Abel and Blanchard
(1986)).
