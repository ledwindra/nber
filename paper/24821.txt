ABSTRACT
We provide the first nation-wide estimates on temperature effects on high-stakes cognitive
performance in a developing country using data from the National College Entrance Examination
(NCEE) in China. The NCEE is one of the most important institutions in China and affects
hundreds of millions of families. We find that a one-standard-deviation increase in temperature
(3.29° C) decreases the total test score by 1.12% (9.62% of a standard deviation) and decreases
the probability of getting into first-tier universities by 1.97% (4.38% of a standard deviation).
This suggests that temperature plays an important role in high-stakes cognitive performance and
has potentially far-reaching impacts for the careers and lifetime earnings of students.

1 Introduction
Every day, billions of humans solve numerous mathematical and logical problems, ranging
in difficulty from basic counting to complex problem-solving. Individual health and well-being
depend on these processes in myriad ways. Good nutrition requires careful tracking of caloric and
nutrient intake. Workers must weigh the pros and cons of micro-decisions over the course of their
day and even during their commute to the office. In ways large and small, risk calculations drive
nearly all aspects of decision making. Thus, any threats to cognitive performance may have
sizeable impacts on the health and well-being of human-based systems. Self-evidently, the impact
of external factors on cognitive performance matters more when the decisions being made are
important and have potentially life changing implications.
One such threat to cognition is temperature. Large segments of the population are regularly
exposed to temporarily or persistently elevated temperatures. The brain’s chemistry, electrical
properties and function are all temperature sensitive (Bowler and Tirri, 1974; Schiff and Somjen,
1985; Deboer, 1998; Yablonskiy et al., 2000; Hocking et al., 2001). Moreover, exposure to heat
has been shown to diminish attention, memory, information retention and processing, and the
performance of psycho-perceptual tasks (Hyde et al., 1997; Hocking et al., 2001; Vasmatzidis et
al., 2002). The impacts of thermal stress on working memory performance are especially relevant
as cognitively challenging tasks rely heavily on the working memory for multi-step processing.
In this paper, we provide the first nation-wide estimates on temperature effects on highstakes cognitive performance in a developing country using data from the National College
Entrance Examination (NCEE), or gaokao, in China. The NCEE offers a useful means of
examining the effect of heat on cognitive performance for several reasons. It is one of the most
1

important institutional features of admissions to post-secondary education in China and affects the
lives of hundreds of millions of families. Each year, around 9 million students take the exam to
compete for admission to around 2,300 colleges and universities. Unlike other countries which rely
upon standardized tests along with other factors such as high-school GPA, extracurricular activities,
and recommendation letters to determine college admissions, the NCEE is almost the sole
determinant for college admission in China1, making it an extremely high-stakes exam. This is
especially true for those aiming for the top-tier universities, as graduates can expect, on average,
to earn 40% more per month than their counterparts from lesser universities (Jia and Li, 2017). The
competition is fierce. Though the overall admission rate of test takers to college or university has
been around 75% in recent years (China Education Online, 2016), the admission rate for the
roughly 100 first-tier universities in China is only 12% (China Education Online, 2015).
Several other features of the NCEE make it particularly well-suited for measuring the
causal effects of temperature on cognitive performance. First, the date of the NCEE is fixed, on
June 7th and 8th, making self-selection on test dates impossible. Second, because the NCEE is held
only once a year, the cost of retaking the exam is quite high, essentially requiring students to repeat
an additional year of high school. Third, during our sample period of 2005-2011, students were
required to take the exam in the same county as with their household registration (hukou).
Therefore, self-selection on exam locations is heavily regulated. Finally, air conditioning is not
available at testing facilities2, thereby eliminating a potentially endogenous adaptation strategy,

1

Less than 0.1% of students can gain admission to college without taking the NCEE (Bai et al., 2014). They
usually take the exams administered by the university itself, or they are waived from having to take the NCEE
because of special talent, such as the winners of National High-School Olympic Competitions.

In regions where air conditioning is available, its use is prohibited during the test period to ensure fair
competition with regions in which AC is not available. More details can be found at:
http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2007-06-07/152711978182s.shtml and http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2014-0605/070830296473.shtml.

and providing a better simulacrum of the conditions under which cognitive tasks are performed
throughout the developing world where air conditioning penetration is quite low.
To examine the impact of temperature on the NCEE performance, we obtained a unique
dataset that covers the universe of students who were admitted into college between 2005-2011
across China, yielding more than 14 million observations. The dataset reports the exam scores
(ranging from 0 to 750) and exam counties for each student. We then match this dataset with daily
weather data on temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, wind speed, sunshine duration,
pressure, and visibility from more than 800 weather stations spread across the entire country.
We find both economically and statistically significant negative effects of temperature on
test scores. In particular, a one-standard-deviation increase in temperature (3.29 °C) decreases total
test scores by 1.12%, or approximately ten percent of one standard deviation in test performance.
The effects are roughly linear in the temperature range found in China during early June – mean
temperature during the exam period is 23.21 °C . Given the significantly negative effect of
temperature on exam scores, we then turn our attention to the effects of temperature on college
admissions. 3 We find that a one-standard-deviation increase in temperature decreases the
probability of getting into first-tier universities by approximately 2 percent. Together, these results
indicate that temperature plays an important role in high-stakes cognitive performance and has
potentially far-reaching impacts for the careers and lifetime earnings of students.
This paper builds upon a growing economics literature that examines the impacts of
temperature on cognitive performance in a developed country context in which air conditioning is
ubiquitous and the ramifications from underperforming on a test are significantly less

3

In China, only students whose scores are above a pre-specified cutoff are eligible to apply for first-tier
universities. Approximately 75% of students are admitted into first-tier universities if their scores are above the
cutoff (Jia and Li, 2017). Since we do not have data on college admission, we proxy top-tier university
admissions based on obtaining a score higher than the cutoff.

consequential (Park, 2017; Graff Zivin et al., 2018).4 It also complements recent work by Garg et
al. (2016), which finds that increases in annual temperature exposure in India can impair test
performance largely through impacts on agricultural yields and nutrition. Our study also has
implications for the study of standardized test performance more generally. While these tests are
often viewed as gold standard for assessing the academic competence of students (Koretz and
Deibert, 1996; Robelen, 2002; US Legal, 2014), recent studies have shown that the time the test is
given as well as local air pollution can impact performance (see Sievertsen et al. (2015) and
Ebenstein et al. (2016), respectively). Temperature appears to be another important factor to add
to this list.
The NCEE is one of the important institutions in China that affects the lives of hundreds of
millions of families in ways large and small (Bai et al., 2014; Chen and Kesten, 2016; Jia and Li,
2017; Cai et al., forthcoming). Since high temperatures impair the NCEE test performance, hotter
regions may be unfairly penalized by the current system. We believe there exist at least three policy
responses to remedy this injustice. First, the time of the NCEE might be shifted from June to cooler
months, such as March, April, or May. In fact, the time of the NCEE was shifted once from July
to June in 2003, to avoid the adverse effects of hot weather on students, but our results suggest that
this shift was insufficient to fully address that concern. Second, AC could be installed and used in
the exam rooms to help protect against the harmful effects of heat and level the playing field across
regions which vary considerably in the average summertime temperatures. Finally, the college
admission authorities could simply adjust test scores under the current system based on our

4

While the relationship between long-run temperature exposure and changes in test scores have also been
examined, these changes in test scores (controlling for weather during the test) reflect the impacts of weather on
learning, as opposed to performance. Graff Zivin et al. (2018) find no such effects on learning, while recent
work by Goodman et al. (2018) find evidence of very small effects that are completely offset by access to air
conditioning.

estimates to ensure that environmental factors are purged from the assessment of intellectual
capabilities.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the
background on the NCEE. In Section 3, we describe the data and the empirical strategy. We present
our results in Section 4 and conclude in Section 5.

2 Empirical Background
The NCEE is a prerequisite for entrance into almost all higher education institutions at the
undergraduate level in China. It is held annually, and is generally taken by students in their last
year of high school. The NCEE has undergone continuous reform since 1978. It was once
uniformly designed by the Ministry of Education (MOE) such that all the students across the
country took exactly the same examination. In the early 2000s, the MOE launched the “unified
examination, provincial proposition” reform (Zhu and Lou, 2011). Provinces and municipalities
were allowed to customize their own exams independently, while the MOE continued to provide a
national exam that could be used by provinces not employing independent exams. In 2011, 16 out
of 31 provinces created customized exams while the others adopted national exam versions.
The most common examination format across provinces during our study period (from
2005 to 2011) is the two-day exam, which takes place annually on June 7th and 8th, and is scored
on a 0-750 scale based on the “3+X” subjects system.5 In the “3+X” subjects system, “3” refers to
the three compulsory subjects: Chinese, Mathematics, and a foreign language usually English (each

5

Six provinces take a three-day exam on Jun 7th, 8th and 9th, including Shanghai, Jiangsu and Guangdong from
2005 to 2011, Hainan and Shandong from 2007 to 2011, and Zhejiang from 2009 to 2011. Four provinces use a
scale rather than 0-750 marks, including Hainan 0-900 from 2005 to 2011, Guangdong 0-900 from 2005 to
2006, Jiangsu 0-440 in 2008, and Shanghai 0-630 from 2005 to 2011. We normalize the scale to 750 marks for
these four provinces.

accounting for 150/750 of the total score) and “X” refers to the combination of science subjects
(biology, chemistry, and physics) for students on the science track, or the combination of art
subjects (geography, history, and political science) for students on the art track (accounting for
300/750 of the total score).6
The NCEE is an extremely high-stakes exam. It is almost the sole determinant for higher
education admission in China. Every year, around 9 million students in China take the exam to
compete for admission to approximately 2,300 colleges and universities. These colleges are
divided into two hierarchical categories: regular colleges and universities that are degree-granting
and academically oriented; and advanced vocational colleges that certify students based on the
attainment of practical and occupational skills. Though the overall admission rate of exam takers
to both forms of higher education ranges from 57% to 72% during our study period, the admission
rate for former category is only around 30%.7 The regular colleges and universities can further be
classified into three tiers according to the recruitment process – Tier 1 universities, generally
regarded as elite or key universities, recruit before Tier 2 and Tier 3 universities and require a much
higher cut-off score for admission.8 Admission rates for Tier 1 universities in recent years has
hovered around 12% and was even lower in earlier years (China Education Online, 2015). The
higher the NCEE score the greater the chance that a student can attend an elite university, which is
highly correlated with future life opportunities and earning potential (Jia and Li, 2017).

There are also a small number of specialized tracks, which include sports, art (music, painting, dancing),
military, and pedagogical. These constitute less than 10% of all track specializations in our data. All students
choose their track of study prior to the start of their second year of high school.

The cut-off score for each tier is the minimum qualifying score for students to apply to universities of the tier,
and varies annually across provinces and subject tracks. It is determined by the Provincial Admission Offices
based on each year’s admission quota and the distribution of student scores within the province (Chen and
Kesten, 2017).

3 Empirical Strategy
3.1 Data
We obtain the NCEE data from the China Institute for Educational Finance Research at
Peking University, which reports the total score and ID for the universe of students enrolled into
college during 2005-2011.9 This dataset includes observations for roughly 2 million students
each year. The student ID contains a six-digit code for county of residence, which we use to
match with weather data. The ID also reports the specific track, allowing us to explore
heterogeneity across the science and art tracks. Unfortunately, we do not have data on scores by
specific subject nor information on where each student enrolls. Data on the cut-off scores that
determine eligibility to apply to first-tier universities for each province-year-track are obtained
from a website specialized for the exam: gaokao.com.
The weather data are obtained from the China Meteorological Data Service Center, which
is an affiliate of the National Meteorological Information Center of China. The data report daily
maximum, minimum and average temperatures, precipitation, relative humidity, wind speed,
sunshine duration, and atmospheric pressure for more than 800 weather stations in China. Data on
visibility are obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the U.S. We
extract weather data during the exam time and then convert from station to county using the
inverse-distance weighting (IDW) method (Deschênes and Greenstone, 2007, 2011). The basic
algorithm calculates weather for a given county based on weighted averages of all weather station

9

Note that the sample only includes students admitted into some type of college or university since test score
data are not available for those students that are not admitted to a school of higher education. Whether our
results generalize to those students that do not attend college is an open question that will depend on the relative
temperature sensitivity of this population.

observations within a 200 km radius of the county centroid, where the weights are the inverse
distance between the weather station and the centroid.
Panel A of Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the exam score, which ranges from 0
to 750. There are more than 14 million observations in total, with a mean of 518.96, and a standard
deviation of roughly 60 marks. Approximately 26% students were in the art track, and 64%
students were in the science track, with the remaining 10% corresponding to students in specialized
tracks.
In panel B, we define a dummy variable which is equal to one if a student’s score is above
or equal to the cutoff for the first-tier universities, as a proxy for admission into a first-tier
university. Approximately 75% of students with a score above the cutoff are admitted into firsttier universities (Jia and Li, 2017). That corresponds to approximately 30% of the students in our
sample.10 Admission rates for the science track are higher than the art track using this proxy, a
results that is consistent with actual admissions patterns at top-tier universities..
We report the summary statistics of weather variables in panel C. The average mean
temperature during the exam period is 23.21 °C. The histogram of average temperature during the
2-day exam period is plotted in Figure 1. This figure reveals a great heterogeneity, with
temperatures ranging from 10 °C to 30 °C, and a peak around 25 °C. To measure the non-linear
effects of temperature, we construct two measures. The first is degree days (DD), which is a piecewise linear function that measures the number of degrees above and below a threshold. Following
Graff Zivin et al., (2018), we deploy a threshold of 20 °C. As can be seen in panel C of Table 1,
the average degree days above or equal 20 °C (DD>=20) is 3.59, and the average below 20 °C
(DD<20) is 0.38, consistent with the skewed distribution of temperature seen in Figure 1. The
10

This rate is higher than the 10% admission rate for the entire population of high school graduates since our
sample only includes students who enrolled into an institution of higher learning.
8

second measure we deploy to capture non-linear effects is a series of indicators of 2 °C bins
(Deschênes and Greenstone, 2011; Barreca et al., 2016; Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2014; Graff Zivin
et al., 2018), with the lowest bin including all temperatures below 12 °C and the highest bin
including all temperatures above 30 °C due to data sparseness at the extremities of the distribution.
Figure A1 in the online appendix plots the percentage of days that fall into each bin.

3.2 Econometric Model
In order to assess the effect of temperature on students’ performance, we estimate the
following equation:
𝑌𝑖𝑐𝑡 = 𝛼0 + 𝛽1 𝑇𝑐𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝑾𝑐𝑡 + 𝛾𝑐 + 𝜂𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑐𝑡 ,
where 𝑖 denotes an individual student, 𝑐 denotes the county in which the exam was taken, and 𝑡
denotes the year the exam was taken. We have two measures for 𝑌𝑖𝑐𝑡 . The first is the logarithm of
the exam score. The logarithm specification was chosen to facilitate interpretation, since point
estimates correspond to the semi-elasticity of exam scores with respect to temperature. As we will
show later, our results are also robust to specifying exam scores in levels. The second is a dummy
variable which is equal to one if a student’s score is equal to or higher than the cutoff for first-tier
universities and zero otherwise. Both specifications are estimated using OLS, although our results
for admission to elite universities remain unchanged when we use a logit specification (as shown
in Table 6). We use 𝑇𝑐𝑡 to denote the average of daily mean temperature (the average between
daily maximum and minimum temperatures) on June 7th and 8th. We do not include temperature in
each day separately because of the strong serial correlation in temperature across days. To explore
the non-linearity of temperature, we use degree day measures and a series of 2 °C bins as described
earlier.

9

The variable 𝑾𝑐𝑡 denotes a vector of weather variables, including precipitation, relative
humidity, wind speed, sunshine duration, atmospheric pressure, and visibility. As with our
temperature variable, all of these are averaged across the two-day exam period. We use 𝛾𝑐 to
denote county fixed effects, which controls for any county-specific time-invariant characteristics,
such as geography or cultural and demographic features that are stable over our study period. We
use 𝜂𝑡 to represent year fixed effects, to control for any nation-wide policy or economic shocks
that could differ by year but affect test takers equally across all counties. The error terms 𝜀𝑖𝑐𝑡 are
clustered by county to allow for serial and spatial correlation within each county.
In the end, our identifying variation is based on county deviations from the mean after we
adjust for common shocks for the whole country in a given year. One potential concern with this
strategy is that exam difficulty varies by province-year, but we cannot include year-by-province
fixed effects because they absorb most of our variation in weather (Fisher et al., 2012). Since the
absence of these fixed effects are only a concern if exam difficulty across provinces is correlated
with temperature, we test this directly. Column (1) of Table 2 reports the average weather for
provinces that use their own exams, and column (2) reports the average weather for provinces using
national exams. Temperatures in provinces that use their own exams are 1.90 °C higher than
temperatures in provinces using national exams (column 3). This difference disappears once the
comparison is conditional on the county and year fixed effects that are included in our model
specification (see column 4).
The coefficient of interest is 𝛽1. Under our linear measure of temperature, this coefficient
measures the percentage change in total score (or the probability change of admission to first-tier
universities) when temperature during the exam increases by 1 °C. When we use degree days, the
coefficient of DD>=20 (DD<20) measures the percentage change in total score (or the probability

10

change of admission to first-tier universities) if temperature increases (decreases) by 1 °C
conditional on temperature being above (below) 20 °C. The non-linear binned approach has a
slightly different interpretation. Here the coefficient of each bin measures the percentage change
in total score (or the probability change of admission to first-tier universities) when temperature
falls into that bin rather than the reference bin of 18-20 °C which was chosen following Graff Zivin
et al. (2018).

4 Results
4.1 Main Results
Table 3 presents the main regression results, where outcomes are defined as the logarithm
of the total test score. The total test score is the summation of scores from three compulsory
subjects, including Chinese, mathematics, and foreign language (typically English) with 150 marks
each plus scores from one combined subject with 300 marks comprising politics, history, and
geography for the art track and physics, chemistry, and biology for the science track. Unfortunately,
the data does not report the score for each specific subject. We report results for all students in
columns (1) and (2), only students in the art track in columns (3) and (4) and only those in the
science track in columns (5) and (6).
In columns (1), (3), and (5), temperature is measured using the average of daily mean
temperature during June 7th and 8th. All the estimates are negative and statistically significant at
the 1% significance level. The coefficient of temperature in column (1) suggests that a 1 °C
increase in temperature decreases the total test score by 0.34%, or 1.76 marks evaluated at the
mean level (mean=518.96). To better place these figures in context, it is helpful to situate them
relative to the weather variability in our dataset. A one-standard-deviation increase in

11

temperature (3.29 °C ) decreases total test scores by 1.12%, or 9.62% of a standard deviation
(standard deviation=60.40).
In columns (2), (4), and (6), we relax the assumption of linearity by specifying temperature
in terms of degree days as described above. As can be seen in column (2), the effect of DD>=20
is significantly negative, and the magnitude is quite close to the linear effect in column (1). This
near identical result is largely an artefact of exam timing. June temperatures in China tend to be
quite high, with a mean temperature of 22.78 °C , which lies above the degree days threshold. In
contrast, the effect of DD<20 is significantly positive, providing additional support for our linear
specification.
When we run subsample analyses for each track separately (see columns (3) – (6)), we
find that the negative effect of temperature is much larger for students in the art track than those
in the science track. For example, a 1 °C increase in temperature decreases the score for the art
track by 0.36%, but only by 0.18% for the science track. Evaluated at the mean level, this is
equivalent to 1.85 marks for the art track (mean=512.66) and 0.94 marks for the science track
(mean=521.20). One possible explanation for this difference is sample composition. The art track
is disproportionately female relative to the science track and recent research suggests that female
test performance in China may be more stress-dependent (Cai et al., forthcoming).
In addition to temperature, we also include precipitation, relative humidity, wind speed,
sunshine duration, pressure, and visibility in the regression model. We find a significantly
positive effect of wind speed, consistent with the notion that higher wind speeds reduce
perceived temperature – the effect of so-called wind chill.11 The effect of sunshine duration is
also significantly positive, as many studies find that sunshine induces good mood and happiness

12

(Schwarz and Clore, 1983; Guven, 2012) and further increases labor productivity (Osward et al.,
2015). The effect of precipitation, humidity, pressure, and visibility are either weakly significant
or statistically insignificant.
In Table 4, we turn our attention to the effects of temperature on admissions to elite
universities. Our estimate in column (1) suggests that a 1 °C increase in temperature decreases
the probability of being admitted to first-tier universities by 0.60%, or 1.33% of a standard
deviation (standard deviation=0.45). When we measure temperature using degree days in column
(2), we find that a 1 °C increase in temperature above 20 °C decreases the admission probability
by 0.75%. As with the linear results, we also find that the effect is larger for those students in the
art track. Interestingly, the impacts of other weather variables differ under this specification, with
the coefficients on precipitation, humidity, and pressure all statistically significant, small (relative
to their mean values) and in the expected direction. The coefficient on visibility, a proxy measure
for pollution, is also negative and statistically significant and reasonably large (a result we will
explore more directly below).
Figure 2 plots the coefficients (in blue) as well as 95% confidence intervals (in grey)
under our non-parametric binned approach when the dependent variable is the log of exam score.
As noted earlier, the 18-20 °C bin is omitted as the reference group, so all other estimates are
relative to it. We find that the coefficient decreases monotonically for all bins hotter than 1214 °C . The magnitude here is also comparable to column (1) in panel A of Table 3. For example,
the estimated coefficient for the above 30 °C bin is -0.0310. Since the difference between bins
above 30 °C and 18-20 °C is approximately 10 °C , each 1 °C increase in temperature decreases a
score by 0.0031 (0.0310/10) log points (-0.0034 log points in column (1) of Table 3). We conduct
a similar exercise in Figure 3, where the dependent variable is the dummy variable for admission
to first-tier universities, and find similar results.
13

Studies show that AC can protect the human body from harms due to excess heat (Barreca
et al., 2016) and it seems plausible that these protective effects might also extend to cognitive
performance. Unfortunately, we do not have data on the availability of AC at test facilities.
Moreover, AC use is supposed to be prohibited during the NCEE to ensure fairness across regions,
some of which clearly do not have AC. Nonetheless, we explore the potential role of AC indirectly,
by splitting our sample into urban districts and rural counties, 12 under the assumption that cities
are more likely to have AC. Table A1 in the online appendix reports these results. The effects of
temperature appear larger in urban districts than rural ones, although these differences are not
significant at conventional levels. Whether the lack of difference suggests a limited protective role
for air conditioning, the effectiveness of the policy ban on usage, or the noisiness of our AC
measure remains an open question.
Since others have found that exposure to fine particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in
diameter (PM2.5) can also impair test performance (Ebenstein et al., 2016), one concern with our
study is that our results may be confounded by air pollution levels in ways that are not fully
captured by our controls for visibility. To examine this issue directly, we use data on the air
pollution index (API) – a composite measure of pollution that ranks air quality based on its
associated health risks (Ministry of Environmental Protection, 2006) – to examine the
relationship between air quality and test performance.13 The API is only available in major cities
and thus our sample size for this analysis is greatly reduced. The estimates are reported in Table
5. Column (1) reports the baseline estimates from Table 3, column (1). Column (2) reports results
from the same specification but only for the sample of cities covered by the API. In column (3)

12

In China, districts (qu) and counties (xian) are in the same administrative level, but districts are typically
located in urban cities.
13
The data on PM2.5 are only available since 2013.
14

we add controls for pollution as measured by the API. Though the sample size in columns (2) and
(3) is less than half of column (1), the effect of temperature remains unchanged, which suggests
that air pollution is not driving our temperature results.
While the results on API are reassuring, it remains possible that PM2.5 could be confounding
our results. To further probe this possibility, we utilize data from a more recent period when that
data are available to examine the correlation between PM2.5 and temperature. These results are
reported in Tables A2 – A4 in the online appendix for the period 2013-2016. Regardless of
functional form, the correlation coefficients are small, providing additional evidence that PM2.5 is
unlikely to explain the relationship between temperature and test performance in our setting.

4.2 Robustness Checks
Table 6 presents robustness checks for our main results. Column (1) is the baseline
model. In column (2) we cluster the standard errors by prefecture (an administrative unit between
province and county), to control for spatial and serial correlation within each prefecture. The
effect of temperature is still statistically significant at the 1% significance level. In column (3),
we calculate the average temperature between June 7th and 8th using daily maximum temperature,
instead of daily mean temperature in the baseline model. The effect is robust, though the
magnitude is slightly smaller, consistent with the observation that most of the testing period
occurs before the hottest part of the day. In column (4) of panel A, we use level of score, instead
of log of score in the baseline model, as the dependent variable. The point estimate is very close
to the estimate when we use the log of score and evaluated at the mean level. In column (4) of
panel B, we use the logit model and report the marginal effect evaluated at the mean level. The
estimate is similar to the linear model. While the NCEE is held in most provinces on June 7th and
8th only, some provinces also have exams on June 9th. Therefore, in column (5), we calculate the

15

average of temperature on June 7th-9th for provinces with a three-day exam. The results are
robust. In the last column, instead of using individual-level score data in the baseline model, we
average scores to county-year and then estimate the regression model to reflect the fact that the
weather data are only at county-year level. Again our results remain robust.

5 Discussion and Conclusion
In this paper, we show that temperature plays an important role in high-stakes cognitive
performance using data from the NCEE, the most important academic examination in China. In
particular, a one-standard-deviation increase in temperature decreases total test scores by 9.62%
of a standard deviation. This is approximately two times larger than the effects found by Park
(2017) for similarly aged students in New York City and 1.5 times larger than that found by
Graff Zivin et al. (2018) for younger children across the United States. The larger magnitude in
our setting may be a reflection of the higher-stakes environment, the limited access to air
conditioning, or fundamental differences in our study populations. It is also noteworthy that our
estimates suggest that a one-standard-deviation change in temperature alters test performance by
roughly the same magnitude as the impacts of the most successful interventions that directly
target educational performance in developing countries J-PAL (2014).
Our results also imply that students in hotter regions may have disadvantages compared
with their peers in cooler regions, highlighting potentially important concerns about equitable
access to higher education within China under the NCEE system. We believe there exist at least
three policy responses to remedy this inherent unfairness in the national testing and admissions
system. First, the time of the NCEE might be shifted from June to cooler months, such as March,
April, or May. In fact, the time of the NCEE was shifted once from July to June in 2003, to avoid
the adverse effects of hot weather on students, but our results suggest that this shift was
16

insufficient to fully address that concern. Second, AC could be installed and used in the exam
rooms. Ironically, some regions prohibit the use of AC to enhance the fairness to regions where
air conditioning is not available, which misses the important point that some regions are always
hotter than others and that the use of AC may have leveled the playing field in the first place.
Third, college admission authorities could adjust the test scores based on our estimates. For
example, they may adjust upward (downward) test scores by 0.34% for counties with
temperature above (below) provincial average every 1 °C .
Though our empirical setting is China, our results have important implications for other
developing countries that utilize standardized testing to gate access to institutions of higher
learning or access to particular professions. Whether these results generalize to a developed country
setting, where AC is more prevalent, remains an open question. Nonetheless, the significant effect
of temperature on cognitive performance suggests a potential channel through which future climate
change may affect economic well-being.

Panel C: Weather

Notes: The NCEE data covers all students enrolled into college during 2005-2011. The observations for the full sample:
14,042,417. The observations for the art track: 3,699,915. The observations for the science track: 8,972,856. The sum
of observations between the art track and the science track is not equal to the observations of the all track due to the
existence of a small number of specialized tracks. The score scale is 0-750 for most provinces. We normalize the score
scale to 750 for provinces that are not using the same scale. All students need to take three compulsory subjects:
Chinese, mathematics, and a foreign language (typically English). The students in the art track need to take one
combined subject comprising politics, history, and geography, and the students in the science track need to take one
combined subject comprising physics, chemistry, and biology. The data on the cutoff of the first-tier universities are
only available for the art and science tracks. The Tier 1 cut-off score is the minimum qualifying score for students to
apply to Tier 1 universities. It is determined by the Provincial Admission Offices based on each year’s admission quota
and the distribution of student scores within the province and track. It varies annually across provinces and subject
tracks. The weather variables are averaged using daily values on June 7th and 8th, when the NCEE is held.

Notes: The dependent variable is the log of the exam score. All weather and air pollution variables are calculated using
the average between June 7th and 8th. Column (1) reports the baseline estimates from Table 1, column (1). Column (2)
reports results from the same specification but only for the sample of cities covered by the air pollution index (API).
In column (3) we add controls for pollution as measured by the API. The regression models also include county fixed
effects and year fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the county level and reported in parentheses. *** p<0.01,
** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

In panel A, the dependent variable is the log of exam score except for column (4), where the dependent variable is the
level of score. In panel B, the dependent variable is a dummy variable which equals to one if the student's score is
above or equal to the cutoff of the first-tier universities and zero otherwise. Column (1) is the baseline model. In
column (2), we cluster standard errors by prefecture, to control for serial and spatial correlation within prefecture.
Noted that prefecture is an administrative unit between province and county. In column (3), we use average of daily
maximum temperature on June 7th and 8th. In column (4) of panel A, we use the level of score as the dependent variable.
In column (4) of panel B, we use the logit model and reported the marginal effects evaluated at the mean level. In
column (5), we include temperature on June 9th for provinces with exams held on June 7th-9th. In column (6), we
collapse observations by county-year, and estimate the model using count-year observations. Standard errors are
clustered at the county level except in column (2) and reported in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

Notes: This table reports the correlation coefficients between PM2.5 and temperature. All variables are calculated using
the average between June 7th and 8th during the period 2013-2016. Columns (1)-(3) report the raw correlation
coefficients and columns (4)-(6) report the correlation coefficients conditional on county fixed effects and year fixed
effects. The variable “Temperature” is the average temperature between June 7th and 8th during the period 2013-2016.
The variable “Degree days (DD) ≥20 (<20)” is the number of degrees above (below) 20 °C constructed using the
variable “Temperature”. The non-parametric approach that ranges from <12 °C to >30 °C, with 2 °C bins in between
is constructed using the variable “Temperature”.
