One Markup to Rule Them All: Taxation by Liquor Pricing Regulation

December 2017
JEL No. D42,D63,H23,L43,L66
ABSTRACT
Government often chooses simple rules to regulate industry even when firms and consumers are
heterogeneous. We evaluate the implications of this practice in the context of alcohol pricing
where the regulator uses a single markup rule that does not vary across products. We estimate an
equilibrium model of wholesale pricing and retail demand for horizontally differentiated spirits
that allows for heterogeneity in consumer preferences based on observable demographics. We
show that the single markup increases market power among upstream firms, particularly small
firms whose portfolios are better positioned to take advantage of the policy. For consumers, the
single markup acts as a progressive tax by overpricing products favored by the rich. It also
decreases aggregate consumer welfare though 16.7% of consumers are better off under the policy.
These consumers tend to be older, less wealthy or educated, and minorities. Simple policies
therefore generate significant cross-subsidies and may be an effective tool for government to
garner favor of key constituencies.

“The paramount role traditionally assigned by economists to government
regulation was to correct the failures of the private market (. . . ), but in fact
the premier role of modern regulation is to redistribute income.”
George J. Stigler: Preface to Chicago Studies in Political Economy

1 Introduction
Policymaking when agents have heterogeneous preferences over outcomes has been widely studied
in the context of theoretical agency models applied to regulatory design (Laffont and Tirole, 1993).
Often however, practical policy interventions fail to follow the intricate nonlinear optimal contract
design needed to account for moral hazard and adverse selection and, instead, simple policy rules
prevail. While technological and administrative limitations may impede the implementation of efficient public policy in practice, Kahn (1970, §7) points out that political objectives or distributional
goals also affect policy outcomes.
We study the use of a simple policy rule in the pricing of alcohol in Pennsylvania where
the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board (PLCB ) operates all retail stores and, by law, applies the
same markup formula to all products regardless of differences in consumer demand or upstream
market power. Our objective is to identify the winners and losers of the single markup among both
upstream distillers and downstream consumers. As the PLCB ’s single markup policy amounts to
a consumption tax, our analysis seeks to broadly address common traits among winners and losers
of uniform taxation.1
Our analysis combines sales data of 312 spirit products sold in 454 local markets across
Pennsylvania, covering all retail stores operated by the PLCB in 2003 and 2004. We merge our
detailed sales data with local market demographics to estimate a random coefficient discrete choice
model of demand for horizontally differentiated spirits based on Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes (1995),
BLP hereafter, where we allow for, but do not impose, market power among upstream firms.2
We document the existence of important preference heterogeneity among consumers of different
demographic traits as well as large differences in product portfolios operated by the upstream
firms. Given our estimates of consumer demand, we estimate the marginal cost of each product
assuming a non-cooperative Bertrand-Nash equilibrium among upstream distillers.

Dasgupta and Stiglitz (1971, 4.3) detail the conditions on preferences, demand elasticities, and labor supply that
ensure that the optimal tax scheme consists of a single consumption tax or markup rate. The theoretical literature
has also established that carefully designed consumption taxes can, similar to income taxation, achieve a given
degree of income redistribution (Atkinson and Stiglitz, 1972). Our paper can thus also be viewed as a first empirical
analysis of the redistributive effects of uniform consumption taxation.

The PLCB sells both wine and spirits but we focus on the latter as spirits represent the most significant category
both in terms of tax revenue and ethanol content. U.S. sales of spirits have also been growing fast at 13.3% between
2007 and 2012, compared to 9% for wine and −4.3% for beer, e.g., see 2012 Beverage Information Group Handbook

Many features of the regulation of alcohol sales in Pennsylvania help set this study apart.
First, the pricing rule is fixed and we observe both wholesale and retail price for each product
sold. We thus do not need to assume an objective for the PLCB when estimating demand in order
to recover the retail marginal costs, as wholesale prices are known to us. Instead, we evaluate
the ability of the current policy to attain the state’s dual goals in selling alcoholic beverages –
generating tax revenue and managing alcohol consumption to internalize the associated external
costs. Second, a product’s price is fixed across the state at a given point in time; upstream firms sell
products to the state, which in turn sells them in its state-run stores. This facilitates identification
of preferences across markets with widely varying demographic profiles. Third, rules regarding the
frequency and advance notice of sales, together with the inability of upstream firms to respond to
spatial variation in demand, alleviate common concerns over price endogeneity. Finally, our data
include the entire spirit retail industry in Pennsylvania. This provides an opportunity to explore
not only how simple regulation impacts welfare among heterogenous consumers but also how it
impacts sophisticated multi-product upstream firms offering diverse product portfolios.
We measure the implications of the single pricing rule by comparing the observed equilibrium
to alternative Stackelberg equilibria in which the PLCB chooses its pricing policy anticipating
the profit-maximizing behavior of upstream firms and utility-maximizing responses of downstream
consumers. This reflect that imperfect competition in the upstream market enables distillers to
impact the equilibrium outcome in the event of a policy change; we allow firms to re-optimize their
wholesale pricing decisions following any change to the PLCB ’s markup policy. In other words, we
account for both the mechanical effect and behavioral response to a change in policy (Saez, 2001)
by not only consumers, but also firms. In contrast, the majority of the optimal taxation literature
assumes perfect competition among firms.3
Our demand estimates indicate significant preference heterogeneity across products and
consumer groups while upstream firms enjoy considerable market power, earning 36 cents in profit
for every dollar in revenue. Taken together, these results indicate that a single markup policy that
ignores these differences among products and the strategic response of firms could generate large
cross-subsidies and have significant consequences for consumers, firms, as well as the state.
We measure these cross subsidies, as well as identify winners and losers of the single markup
policy, by comparing the current regulation to equilibrium outcomes generated by alternative
policies in which the regulator internalizes demand heterogeneity and upstream market power
through product-specific markups. As our demand estimation does not require us to take a stand on
the PLCB ’s objective, we first test whether the observed 30% markup is consistent with maximizing
tax revenue for the state’s general fund finding the single markup policy that maximizes tax revenue.
We find that the PLCB can maximize tax revenue by reducing its uniform tax rate from 30% to
23.7%. Such a reduction generates increases in industry profits – the sum of distiller profit and
3

The computational re-optimization of distillers’ wholesale pricing following a change in markup policy amounts to
evaluating the pass-through effect of a tax in a non-competitive model of horizontally differentiated products, an
empirical extension of the work of Weyl and Fabinger (2013).

PLCB profit / tax revenue – of $16.15 million, but 94.4% of this increase is captured by upstream
firms, mirroring findings in Miravete, Seim and Thurk (2017). The current 30% markup rule
thus captures 99.6% of potential tax revenues attainable with a single markup policy. This result
is remarkable because it provides evidence that, conditional on employing a single markup, the
current policy leaves little money on the table.
If instead the PLCB chose the vector of 312 product-specific markups that maximize tax
revenue, aggregate tax revenue would increase 9.8% ($24.70 million) as the state captures nearly
all of the incremental industry profits. Thus, product-level markups provide flexibility for the
regulator to use differences in product elasticities to increase competition and lower margins in
the upstream market and extract a greater share of industry profits. Interestingly, consumers also
benefit from moving to this policy as aggregate consumer welfare improves $9.47 million, or 1.5% of
the average drinking-age resident’s liquor expenditure. While we choose the product-level markups
to weakly increase tax revenue ex ante, the welfare effect to consumers is theoretically ambiguous.
One contribution of the paper is therefore to showcase an empirical example where a uniform
consumption tax not only leaves money on the table, but also decreases consumer welfare.
The single markup also redistributes rents within the upstream firm and downstream
consumer segments. For firms, the uniform tax transfers profits from large to small firms and
a significant beneficiary of the current policy is a local firm based in Philadelphia, Jacquin. The
firm plays a minor role in markets outside of Pennsylvania and we argue that Jacquin’s success
under the single markup stems from its ability to lever local market knowledge to sell niche products
that are under-priced under the single markup policy. In contrast, large firms such as Diageo and
Bacardi operate broad product portfolios. For consumers, the single markup policy amounts to
a progressive tax that overprices the spirits favored by higher income consumers who are also
less sensitive to changes in price. While most Pennsylvania residents are better off under the
equilibrium generated by product-level markups, 16% of residents prefer the single markup policy.
These consumers tend to be older, less wealthy, less educated, and minorities. We show that these
results are robust to a less sophisticated pricing policy in which the PLCB sets markups by spirit
type (6 types) and bottle size (3 sizes).
We evaluate the optimality of the single markup by comparing the observed equilibrium
to equilibria generated by product-level markups that maximize consumer surplus but are tax
revenue neutral as in Ramsey (1927). Absent any externalities, consumers are far better off
under the Ramsey solution as aggregate consumer welfare increases $95.08 million (15.4% of liquor
expenditure) due to lower equilibrium retail prices on average and an increase in quantity sold.
Our initial focus on tax revenue generation is motivated by both the significant tax revenue
the PLCB generates for the state’s general fund in practice and recent state legislation designed
increase the PLCB ’s profitability. The original goal for the PLCB at its creation in 1933 was,
however, to “discourage the purchase of alcoholic beverages by making it as inconvenient and
expensive as possible”, as stated by then Governor Gifford Pinchot. If we assume, therefore, that the
PLCB uses the tax revenue generated by the 30% single markup exclusively to offset the external

–3–

costs of alcohol consumption, we are able to obtain an estimate of the implicit average external
cost per unit of ethanol consumed. Given this cost estimate, we show that it is possible to design
product-level markups that increase consumption and consumer welfare, but also generate sufficient
additional tax revenue to cover the associated larger external costs. Relative to the single markup,
this alternative policy would leave older, less wealthy, less educated, and minority consumers, and
smaller firms worse off.
In a famous paper, Posner (1971) referred to the use of uniform rates as an example
of the so-called taxation-by-regulation effect. In our case, the taxation-by-regulation effect of a
single markup rule is its induced income redistribution through cross-subsidization of spirit prices.
Posner’s taxation-by-regulation has long been acknowledged in the theoretical literature, though
there exist few empirical studies. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first to measure
taxation-by-regulation using an equilibrium model that not only addresses the best responses of
consumers to changes in government policy but also incorporates optimal responses of suppliers.4
Moreover, we identify common traits among winners and losers of this regulation and find that
current markup regulation generates significant distortions that favor particular constituencies: a
small local distiller and well-defined consumer groups.5
Whether or not the state legislature explicitly targeted these groups in designing the single
markup is difficult to say. Our point is that regardless of the state government’s intent, these groups
benefited from the retail price distortions generated by the single markup policy. Indeed, our results
do not require us to take a stand regarding the objective of the state legislature in crafting the single
markup policy. Instead, we show that by restricting the PLCB to a 30% single markup policy, the
state legislature leaves money on the table, decreases aggregate welfare, and generates significant
redistribution across consumers and firms. We thus identify the implicit effects without addressing
whether they are the intended outcome of the regulator or the unintended consequence of a policy
that ignored the economic incentives underlying Posner’s taxation-by-regulation argument.
If redistribution was the regulator’s motivation, our results hint that simple policy can
be used to garner favor among key constituencies: older, poorer, and less educated consumers
in our case. If redistribution was only the unintended consequence of regulation, our results
amount to a measurement of the cross-subsidies induced by such policy. In either case our results
demonstrate that a uniform tax can generate significant redistribution among consumers and firms,
while proponents of uniform taxes oftn argue that these taxes are inherently fair as they treat
everyone equally. Our results indicate just the opposite.
4

For instance, Linneman (1980, §5) provides back-of-the-envelope estimates of profit redistribution (in favor of large
manufacturers) and uneven price increases (hurting low income families) after the 1973 Mattress Flammability
Standard. Finkelstein, Poterba and Rothschild (2009) make use of numerical simulations to evaluate the allocation
efficiencies and redistribution effects of not allowing for gender-based pricing (different mortality risk) among
participants of the U.K. annuity market. In another related paper, Hausman (1998) does not address redistribution
effects and focuses only on the allocation inefficiency of taxing interstate telephone service to subsidize internet
access for schools and libraries.

5

Seim and Waldfogel (2013, §1.C) also show that the unionized store clerks who operate the state-run network of
liquor stores are overpaid (both in wages and benefits) relative to private retailing.

–4–

Our work complements other recent papers dealing with the retail regulation of alcoholic
beverages. For instance, Seim and Waldfogel (2013), Aguirregabiria, Ershov and Suzuki (2016), and
Illanes and Moshary (2015) address the effects of entry restrictions, e.g., no entry in Pennsylvania,
partial entry in the wine segment in Ontario, and privatization of the alcohol distribution system in
Washington State, respectively. Others focus on the possibility that regulation facilitates collusion
among wholesalers: Conlon and Rao (2015) analyzes “post and hold” regulation and Miller and
Weinberg (2015) use mergers in the brewing industry to identify collusive behavior. In our analysis
we evaluate product-specific markups driven by the elasticity of demand of each product rather
than by its alcohol content. Griffith, O’Connell and Smith (2017) do the opposite and introduce
differentiated product markups based on corrective taxes that minimize health externalities due
to ethanol consumption. Finally, in a related paper (Miravete et al., 2017), we show how the
strategic pricing response of firms interacts with the regulator’s ability to use taxation to generate
tax revenue, finding that upstream market power flattens the Laffer Curve.
Our paper is also related to classic questions around the value foregone through uniform
pricing over sophisticated pricing and price discrimination, though our case focuses on uniform
markups across products, rather than uniformly priced, heterogeneous products or uniform prices
across locations for a given product. Cho and Rust (2010), Shiller and Waldfogel (2011), and
Orbach and Einav (2007) provide evidence on uniform pricing of products of different attributes
– car rentals, song downloads, and movies, respectively. Empirical evidence on uniform pricing
across heterogeneous geographic markets includes Adams and Williams (2017) for a single product
in home improvement supply stores, Chintagunta, Dubé and Singh (2003) for a small set of products
in supermarkets in Chicago, and Della Vigna and Gentzkow (2017) for one million products across
35, 000 stores in the U.S. The latter work provides convincing evidence that uniform pricing is
likely due to the existence of important managerial decision-making costs (Bloom and Reenen,
2007), rather than due to a lack of sufficient heterogeneity in demand across local markets. Our
work complements these papers by considering cross-subsidies among heterogenous consumers and
firms due to legislatively mandated uniform markups, an important feature of consumption taxes
generally.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our data, documents heterogeneous
consumption patterns across demographic groups, and discusses the rules currently governing
PLCB ’s pricing and its interaction with the upstream market firms, the distillers. Section 3
presents an equilibrium discrete choice model of demand of horizontally differentiated spirits that
incorporates the features of the current pricing regulations while accounting for oligopoly competition in the upstream distillery market. Section 4 reports our estimates and documents significant
heterogeneity of preferences for spirits as well as significant market power in the upstream distillery
market. In Section 5 we use the estimated model to measure the effects of the single markup on
firms, consumers, and state tax revenues. We conclude in Section 6. Additional information on
data construction, detailed descriptive statistics, estimation algorithm, robustness, and detailed
results are included in the Appendices.

2 The Pennsylvania Market for Spirits
In this section, we briefly summarize the regulation of alcoholic beverages in Pennsylvania that
informs our theoretical modeling and econometric identification. We then describe the data we
obtained from the PLCB and other sources on sales, prices, characteristics of products sold by the
PLCB and the upstream distillery market. Finally, we document the heterogeneity of consumer
preferences for different types of spirits and quantity of alcohol consumed that is behind the
differentiated incidence of the current 30% taxation rule.6
2.1 The Mechanics of the Pricing Regulation
Pennsylvania adheres to the common three-tier alcoholic beverage distribution system adopted by
most states after the repeal of Prohibition: distillers sell their products to wholesale distributors
who then sell to retailers, and only retailers may sell to consumers. Unlike most states, the PLCB
vertically integrates and monopolizes wholesale and retail distribution of wine and spirits.7
The Pennsylvania State Legislature provides guidance on the prices the PLCB charges
both across products and across stores, e.g., Pennsylvania Liquor Code (47 P.S. §1-101 et seq.)
and the Pennsylvania Code Title 40. Since its inception in 1933, the PLCB has regulated alcohol,
particularly spirits and wines, using a simple pricing rule that transforms upstream prices into
retail prices. This rule has been modified only a limited number of times. From 1937 until 1980
the PLCB implemented a uniform markup rule that amounted to a markup (an ad valorem tax)
over wholesale cost of 55% for all gins and whiskeys and 60% for other products. In 1980, the
Pennsylvania legislature introduced a per-unit handling fee, the Logistics, Transportation, and
Merchandise Factor (LTMF ) and reduced the markup to 25% for all products. In 1993, the
markup increased to 30% and the handling fee began varying by bottle size, resulting in a per-unit
charge of $1.05, $1.20, and $1.55 for 375 ml, 750 ml, and 1.75 L bottles, respectively.8 Consumers
also pay an 18% ad valorem tax on all liquor purchases – the so-called “Johnstown Flood Tax”
that was instituted as a temporary emergency relief measure in 1936 but has never been repealed.9
Summarizing these elements, the uniform pricing rule employed by the PLCB during our 2003-2004
sample period is
6

Miravete et al. (2017) provide additional detail on the market environment, in particular pertaining to pricing
interaction along the supply chain.

7

This was the case over the period from 1933 to 2016, when Pennsylvania’s Act 39 allowed for the controlled entry
of private retailers into wine sales, although the PLCB continues to serve as their supplier. Pennsylvania also has
a private system for the sale of beer, allowing the controlled entry of private retailers.

8

In 2016 the Pennsylvania state legislature relaxed the requirement that the 30% tax be applied categorically to all
products by allowing the PLCB to depart from uniform pricing on the top 150 wine and top 150 spirits products.
At the time of this writing, the agency has chosen to exercise this option for only 17 of the 300 eligible products,
focusing on wines and spirits outside the top 100 and lowering the price below the one prescribed by the uniform
pricing rule.

9

The PLCB collects an additional 6% Pennsylvania sales tax on the posted price to generate the final price paid by
the consumer.

–6–

pr = [pw × 1.30 + LTMF ] × 1.18 ,

(1)

where pr is the retail price of a given product with wholesale price, pw . Given the simple structure of
the pricing regulation and the vertical integration of wholesale and retail segments in Pennsylvania,
the pricing rule is simply a combination of ad valorem and unit taxes. Our focus in this paper is
the 30% uniform markup; we take at face value that the fixed fees simply represent the storage and
transportation costs of bottles of different sizes.
Due to the legislated pricing formula, the wholesale pricing decisions of the PLCB ’s suppliers, e.g., distillers, are largely responsible for inducing retail price changes; any change in their
prices is immediately passed on to retail prices. For the mature products we consider, the PLCB
places certain restrictions on the number and frequency of wholesale price changes over the course of
the year. Temporary wholesale price changes, typically price reductions or sales, amount to 89.7%
of price changes in the sample and last for four or five weeks from the last Monday of each month.
A product can be put on sale up to four times a year, or once per quarter. A product can thus go
on sale for one month, but not two months in a row. Permanent price changes take effect at the
beginning of one of the PLCB ’s four-week long reporting periods for accounting purposes, a slightly
different periodicity from the sale periods. See Appendix A for further details. Finally, distillers
need to inform the PLCB of any proposed temporary price changes at least five months ahead
of the desired sale period. Because they need to decide far ahead of time when to run temporary
sales, the distillers’ ability to respond to unexpected demand swings is limited, facilitating a cleaner
identification of demand responses to price changes.
2.2 Data: Quantities Sold, Prices, and Characteristics of Spirits
Our data, obtained under the Pennsylvania Right-to-Know Law, contain daily information on
quantities sold and gross receipts at the UPC and store level for all spirits carried by the PLCB
during 2003 and 2004. We aggregate the daily data to the monthly sales periods, resulting in 22
periods for our sample.10 The PLCB also provided the wholesale cost of each product, which is
constant across stores, but varies over time reflecting the temporary or permanent price changes
discussed above.
Each store carries a vast variety of products among which we focus on popular 375 ml,
750 ml, and 1.75 L spirits products, representing 64.1% of total spirit sales measured in bottles
and 70.1% of total spirit sales by revenue.11 The resulting sample contains 312 products across the
two-year sample. We see little variation in the product set across stores indicating that consumers
have equal access to the products we consider in the sample.
10

We drop periods that overlap with January due to a significant reduction in temporary price changes.

11

Many products are available to consumers but are seldom purchased. The 375 ml, 750 ml, and 1.75 L bottle sizes
account for 80.9% of total spirit sales by volume and 91.6% of total spirit sales by revenue. Within these bottle
sizes we further focus on popular products which we define as those products that account for 80% of bottle sales
in each spirit type-bottle size pair. We also dropped tequilas as there were few products. In total, these restrictions
allow us to drop a total of 1,313 products from our sample.

–7–

We classify products into six categories: brandy, cordials, gin, rum, vodka, and whiskey. For
each product, the PLCB provided its alcohol content measured as proof (100 proof corresponds to
50% alcohol content by volume) and whether or not the product is imported or contains flavorings.
Table 1 summarizes these product characteristics. Vodkas and whiskeys have significantly larger
market shares (32.1% and 24%, respectively), than rum (16.3%), cordials (13.6%), or brandy (7.3%),
even though cordials in particular is one of the top categories in terms of number of products.
Flavored spirits, which represent 16.3% of products, are primarily cordials and brandies and, to a
lesser extent, rums and vodkas. Most whiskeys and cordials are imported while other spirits are
predominantly domestic. There is significant variation in proof across product categories; while the
average across all products is 75.33, it ranges from 55.82 for cordials to 83.42 for gins.12

Notes: “Price” is the average price weighted by quantity sold (bottles). “Share” is based on number of bottles
sold. “Cheap” (“Expensive”) products are those products whose mean price is below (above) the mean price of all
spirits of the same spirit type and bottle size.

We characterize spirits as expensive when their simple averaged price exceeds the mean price
of all spirits of the same type and bottle size. Table 1 shows that expensive spirits are purchased
nearly as often as cheaper ones, but are less likely to be flavored or domestically produced and have
higher proof. The 750 ml bottle is the most popular size in terms of unit sales and product variety,
accounting for 50.3% of unit sales and 54.5% of available spirits products, followed by the 1.75 L
bottle with a share of 34.5% of unit sales and 30.1% of products. The smallest bottles we consider,
those in the 375 ml format, account for the remaining 15.2% of units sold and 15.4% of products.13
12

In addition to these characteristics, the empirical analysis also includes a measure of product quality obtained from
Proof66.com, a spirits ratings aggregator. We do not include it in Table 1 because the product score is primarily
informative within, but not across, spirit categories.

13

Table 1 and Table B.1 in Appendix B show that average bottle prices increase with bottle size, both in total and
within spirit category although it decreases by per ounce. This explains why the revenue share of 1.75 L bottles,
43.7%, exceeds the share of bottles sold, 34.5%.

–8–

Some of this variation is driven by the product set as upstream firms manufacture brands
in particular bottle sizes. For instance, our final sample is composed of 198 brands (e.g., Captain
Morgan) but 88 of these brands were available only in the 750 ml bottle size while 1 and 31 brands
were offered only in the 375 ml and 1.75 L size, respectively. The remaining 78 brands were offered
in several bottle sizes (e.g., Diageo sold Captain Morgan in 375 ml, 750 ml, and 1.75 L sizes).14

Notes: The “Holiday” season is defined as the two pricing periods that encompass
Thanksgiving through the end of the year. Statistics reflect the percent of products
with a temporary price reduction during the corresponding period except for “Times,”
which denotes the average number of times that spirits in each category are on sale during
a year.

While Table 1 summarized mean price differences between products of different spirit types,
Table 2 summarizes price changes over time. As discussed above, these largely originate from
distillers temporarily adjusting their products’ wholesale price resulting in monthly retail sales.
Distillers temporarily change a product’s price 2.6 times per year on average, and most products,
73%, go on sale at least once a year. Distillers place vodkas, whiskeys, cheaper products, and
products in larger bottle sizes (750ml or 1.75L) on sale more frequently than average. A significant
share of all spirits products – 44% – go on sale at some point during the holidays, which we define
as pricing periods that overlap with Thanksgiving through the end of the year. While over 63% of
cheap products go on sale at some point in the year, the average product is placed on sale only 1.36
times, far less than other product categories. In contrast, 375 ml products are also less frequently
subject to any temporary price reductions, on average, but those 375 ml products that do go on
sale at least once are placed on sale three times per year on average. The monthly sales activity,
together with variation in the amount of price reduction, are our primary source of price variation
to identify consumers’ price responsiveness.

This pattern is reflected in the raw data as well where 958 of the potential 1, 192 brands were offered only in one
bottle size, usually the 750 ml format.

2.3 The Upstream Distillers
Our objective in this paper is to assess the differential effect of the uniform markup policy on
equilibrium behavior of different groups of agents to uncover Posner’s taxation-by-regulation. As
the pricing formula in equation (1) highlights, how any alternative markup policy affects retail
prices and consumer behavior depends on how wholesale prices respond to the markup policy.
Weyl and Fabinger (2013, §4) show that the pass-through of a tax depends on the market conduct
and responses of the taxed upstream firms. In our setting, the upstream firms’ markups depend
on the characteristics and positioning of their product portfolios. This section provides a brief
summary of the features of the upstream distillery market.
During our sample period, the upstream distillery market was composed of 34 firms with
broad arrays of product portfolios summarized in Tables 3 and 4. The market leader, Diageo,
accounted for 22% of total unit sales and 25% of revenue, while a large set of small fringe producers
(29) accounted for 42% and 46% of total quantity sold and revenue, respectively. Nineteen of these
firms operated product portfolios of less than five products and seven were single product firms.

Notes: Sample of distilleries with national brands. Firms ordered according to market
share based on revenue.

In Table 4 we show that large firms such as Diageo and Bacardi operated extensive product
portfolios although there was also substantial heterogeneity across firms in their product offerings.
For example, Diageo had a relatively balanced portfolio where rums, vodkas, and whiskeys generated
approximately 21%, 31%, and 25% of its total revenue, respectively. In contrast, Bacardi operated
a much more concentrated portfolio as 71% of its revenue came from its rum products compared to
19% from whiskey products. Among the larger competitors with unit shares of the Pennsylvania
market of at least 5%, only the Pennsylvania-based firm Jacquin sells brandies, where it faces only
seven smaller competitors and generates 22% of its revenue. While the company offers products in
all bottle sizes and spirit types, its portfolio focuses exclusively on cheap products.
Table 4 documents that a significant number of competitors are present in all product
categories. Nevertheless, the upstream distiller market is best characterized as oligopolistic, with
Herfindahl-Hirshman indices ranging from 1,023 for cordials to 3,087 for rums (951 for spirits in
total). We therefore assume that distillers set wholesale prices non-cooperatively as in a Bertrand-

marginal costs and predict their optimal behavior under alternative PLCB pricing strategies.
2.4 Heterogeneity of Preferences for Quantity and Varieties of Spirits
Pennsylvania is a demographically diverse state, which allows us to trace consumer preferences
across a wide range of demographic profiles. We geocode the 624 stores’ street addresses to link their
geographic location to data on population and demographic characteristics for nearby consumers
based on the 2000 Census. We combine Pennsylvania’s Census block groups into markets, assigning
each to the operating store that is closest to them in any time period. We further consolidate stores
in the same ZIP code resulting in 454 total local markets.15 Table 5 summarizes these demographic
characteristics. About 39% of households in Pennsylvania make more than $50, 000 a year, but the
income distribution differs significantly across markets, with rich households comprising anywhere
between 10% to 76% of the population across markets. Similarly, the share of minority households
in a market ranges from virtually zero to 99%, with minorities comprising 13% of citizens in the
average market. We see similar diversity in educational attainment with 44% of residents in the
average market reporting at least some college education but this varies from 13% to 87% across
the state. Finally, there is less disparity in age where the average age in the average market is 40
while the youngest market has an average age of 31 and the oldest market has an age of 43.

15

Because stores open and close during the year, the characteristics of stores’ ambient consumers also change over
time, which helps identify the effect of demographic interactions. See Appendix A for further detail on store
openings and closings, ambient demographics, and widespread availability of most spirits in every store.

population with some college education. minority defined as share of non-white population. income is the share
of households with income greater than $50,000. Figure B.1 in Appendix B we present the spatial distribution of
demographics.

Do these wide differences in the demographics of local markets translate into heterogeneity
in terms of ethanol consumed and tax revenue generated, both measures linked to the PLCB ’s
objectives? We answer this question by dividing the store markets into quintiles based on each
of the four demographic traits – the share of households with incomes above $50,000, the share
of non-white or minority households, the share of residents with some college education, and the
average age. As markets differ in their consumption of ethanol, we also split the markets according
to per capita ethanol consumption where a market in the top (bottom) quintile is designated as a
high (low) “Risk” market.

Notes: Graphs compare shares of total ethanol consumption and tax revenue garnered by the bottom and top 20% of markets
according to the demographic trait considered. We denote the difference between the retail price and the wholesale cost as the
single amount of tax revenue per bottle, not differentiating between the ad valorem tax (markup), the handling fee, and the
liquor tax. Total tax revenue is then tax revenue per bottle times number of bottles purchased. Since tax revenue per bottle is
near proportional to the final retail price of equation (1), variation in total tax revenue across markets also maps into differences
in consumer spending.

In Figure 1 we present the shares of total tax revenue and total ethanol consumption
for markets in the top and bottom quintiles for each trait, relative to a 20% benchmark (the
dashed line) corresponding to the case where market attributes do not correlate with consumption
and expenditures. We observe high ethanol consumption and spending in markets with high

– 12 –

concentrations of wealthy, well-educated, young, and non-white consumers.16 Interestingly, the
difference in the consumption shares of the top and bottom markets in the distribution is always
greater than the difference in the share of taxes paid. High risk markets (i.e., the top 20% of
markets by per capita consumption) consume 33% of the total ethanol in the state and generate
29% of total tax revenue. In contrast, ethanol consumption in low risk markets accounts for only
5% of total ethanol sales and generates 11% of total tax revenue.

Notes: Statistics represent market shares (based on bottles sold) by product characteristic. Demographic categories are defined
in Table 5 or, in the case of “Risk,” in the text.

In Table 6 we complete our analysis by documenting the heterogeneity of preferences for
different types of spirits across consumers with different demographic characteristics and alcohol
consumption habits. We do so by calculating the market shares (by unit sales) in each demographic
cohort. For example, from Table 6 we see that 38.6% of bottles purchased in the wealthiest 20% of
markets were 1.75 L bottles. We can then infer differences in preferences by reading across columns
(i.e., demographics) for a given product characteristic (e.g., 1.75 L bottles). Recall that retail prices
at a point in time are identical across the state and stores carry similar product sets so differences
in purchase patterns across demographics reveals differences in preferences (see Appendix A).
The data indicate that minorities strongly favor brandy, gin, and 375 ml products, but not
whiskey or 1.75 L products. In markets with high income and a highly educated population, vodka
is far more popular than rum and brandy while consumers also tend to buy more expensive spirits.
Markets dominated by young, less educated, and lower income populations show a clear preference
for cheap products. The popular 750 ml bottle amounts to almost exactly half of all bottle sales
across demographic traits, but between the 375 ml and 1.75 L sizes, higher-income markets clearly
16

The finding that per capita ethanol consumption and income are positively correlated has been demonstrated in
earlier work though the exact mechanism is unclear, e.g., see Cerda, Johnson-Lawrence and Galea, 2011. Researchers
often cite social norms or even social networking as causes.

favor 1.75 L products. Finally, heavy drinkers, i.e., consumers in high “risk” markets, prefer
expensive and vodka products but are unlikely to purchase 375 ml bottles; preferences that reflect
the positive correlation between per capita ethanol consumption and income.

3 Model
In this section we describe a static model of oligopoly price competition with differentiated goods.
We envision a two-stage Stackelberg game where the regulator first commits to a markup (or tax)
policy. Upstream distillers observe the policy and then simultaneous choose wholesale prices pw to
maximize profits each period. The chosen wholesale prices translate into specific retail prices based
on the regulator’s chosen markup policy. Finally, consumers in each market choose the product
that maximizes their utility given the retail prices and characteristics of all products.
The purpose of the model is twofold. First, the model lays out how consumers respond to
the chosen retail prices. We rely on a flexible utility specification to estimate consumer preferences
from observed consumer choices over time and across markets. The estimated preferences facilitate
predicting consumer responses to counterfactual pricing policies. Second, the model highlights
that the retail prices the consumer is exposed to are driven to a significant degree by the strategic
wholesale price choices in the upstream market. If the PLCB were to alter its pricing rule, upstream
distillers would choose different wholesale prices leading to different retail prices and consumer
purchase decisions. We thus need to incorporate upstream behavior in the model in order to
appropriately conduct our counterfactual analysis. We begin with a description of the consumer’s
choice problem and then continue with the distillers’ pricing problem.
3.1 A Discrete Choice Model of Demand for Spirits
We follow the large literature on discrete-choice demand system estimation using aggregate market
share data (Berry, 1994; Berry et al., 1995; Nevo, 2001) to model demand for spirits as a function
of product characteristics and prices. By mapping the distribution of consumer demographics into
preferences, the model enables us to estimate realistic substitution patterns between products while
accounting for the heterogeneity in preferences exhibited in Table 6. We assume that consumer i in
market l in period t obtains the following indirect utility from consuming a bottle of spirit j ∈ Jlt 17
uijlt = xj βi∗ + αi∗ prjt + Ht γ + ξjlt + ijlt ,
where i = 1, . . . , Mlt ;

j = 1, . . . , Jlt ;

(2)
l = 1, . . . , L;

t = 1, . . . , T .

The n × 1 vector of observed product characteristics xj is identical in all markets l where
product j is available and fixed over time, though the availability of different spirits changes over
17

In the absence of individual purchase information we opt to treat bottles of different sizes of the same spirit as
different products with identical observable characteristics other than size and focus on horizontal differentiation
between products.

time due to product introductions or removals. The T × 2 matrix Ht = [q3t m12t ] includes a
summer dummy for periods in July, August, and September and a holiday dummy for periods
t coinciding with the holiday season from Thanksgiving to the end of the year. The price of
product j at time t is denoted prjt and is the same across all markets l. We further allow utility
to vary across products, markets, and time via the time and location-specific product valuations
ξjlt , which are common knowledge to consumers, upstream firms, and the PLCB but unobserved
by the econometrician. Lastly, ijlt denotes the idiosyncratic unobserved preferences by consumer
i for product j in market l and period t, which we assume to be distributed Type-I extreme value
across all available products Jlt .
We characterize consumer i in market l by a d-vector of observed demographic attributes,
Dil including age, education, income, and race. To allow for individual heterogeneity in purchase
behavior, we model the distribution of consumer preferences over characteristics and prices as
multivariate normal with a mean νil that shifts with these consumer attributes

where Π is a (n + 1) × d matrix of coefficients that measures the effect of observable individual
attributes on the consumer valuation for spirit characteristics including price, while Σ measures
the covariance in unobserved preferences across characteristics. We restrict Σjk = 0 ∀k 6= j,
and estimate only the variance in unobserved preferences for characteristics.18 Similarly, the
contribution of demographic and product characteristic interactions (Π) allows cross-price elasticities to vary differentially in markets with observed differences in demographics. Exogenous
store openings/closings alter the demographic composition of demand for surrounding stores and
help us identify these demographic interactions. We make the common assumption that during a
particular time period, each consumer selects either one bottle of the Jlt spirits available in her
market, or opts to purchase beer or wine for off-premise consumption, i.e., not consumed in a
restaurant or bar.19 We denote this outside option, denominated in 750 ml bottle-equivalents, by
j = 0 with zero mean utility.
The annual potential market for location l is the number of drinking-age residents scaled by
per-capita off-premise consumption. Hence, a consumer opting for the outside option is choosing to
18

Introducing unobserved preferences for a given characteristic j allows cross-price elasticities among products with
similar characteristics (e.g., proof) to be higher than in a simple Logit model, thereby relaxing the restrictive
substitution patterns generated by the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) property of the multinomial
logit model.

19

Nevo (2000, p.401) discusses limitations of the present discrete choice approach when instead, individuals purchase
several products or multiple bottles of the same product at the same time. If such consumer behavior were
important, Hendel (1999) and Hendel and Nevo (2006) show that assuming single-unit purchases could understate
price elasticities in the case of assortment decisions, but overstate own-price elasticities in the case of stockpiling.
In Miravete et al. (2017) we test for stockpiling using a similar dataset and find no evidence. Similarly, Seim and
Waldfogel (2013) present suggestive evidence that the PLCB ’s demand does not respond to price declines more
strongly than average in areas with higher travel costs to the store where customers have a higher incentive to buy
larger quantities or assortments.

consume a 750 ml “bottle” of beer (i.e., roughly two bottles of beer) or a 750 ml bottle of wine.20 The
average drinking-age Pennsylvanian consumed 96.2 liters of alcoholic beverages through off-premise
channels in 2003, or 128.2 750 ml bottle equivalents according to Haughwout, Lavallee and Castle
(2015). The 2003 potential market for location l is then the number of drinking-age residents
scaled by 128.2, which we allocate evenly across pricing periods according to the periods’ lengths
to give us the potential market per period, Mlt . To put this figure in perspective, beer accounts
for approximately 90% of total consumption by volume so the average drinking-age Pennsylvanian
consumed slightly less than five 375 ml bottles of beer per week, but only approximately thirteen
750 ml bottles of both wine and spirits annually. We follow a similar approach in constructing the
potential market for 2004.
Consumer utility-maximization connects the set of individual-specific attributes and the set
of product characteristics as follows
Ajt (x· , pr·t , ξ·t ; θ) = {(Dil , νil , i·lt ) |uijlt ≥ uiklt

∀k = 0, 1, . . . , Jlt } ,

(4)

where we summarize all model parameters by θ. We follow the literature in decomposing the
deterministic portion of the consumer’s indirect utility into a common part shared across consumers,
δjlt , and an idiosyncratic component, µijlt , given by
δjlt = xj β + αprjt + Ht γ + ξjlt ,


µijlt = xj prjt (ΠDil + Σνil ) .

(5a)
(5b)

In estimating the model, we integrate over the distribution of i·lt analytically. The probability that consumer i purchases product j in market l in period t is then
sijlt =

Note that this definition accounts for the total volume of alcoholic beverages but not for the different ethanol
contents of beer (4.5% on average), wine (12.9% on average), and spirits (37.7% on average in our sample).

3.1.1 Consumer Welfare
An advantage of a structural model is that it enables the researcher to assess equilibrium changes
in welfare. We identify beneficiaries of the single markup policy by evaluating changes in consumer
welfare via compensating variation, i.e., the amount of income necessary to keep individuals in a
given market indifferent between the counterfactual set of prices p0 and the current ones p under
the single markup rule,

As defined, residents in location l are on average better off under the current policy when CVl (p) > 0,
i.e., when the mean compensating variation is greater than zero, consumers at this location would
be willing to pay the government to not adopt the policy that generates retail prices p0 .21
3.2 An Oligopoly Model for Distillers
Given optimal consumer choices, we now consider competition between upstream distillers. A total
of F firms compete in the upstream market where each firm f ∈ F produces a subset Jtf of the
j = 1, . . . , Jt products. In each period t the upstream firms simultaneously choose the vector of

Implicitly we are assuming that a change in PLCB spirit pricing policy has no effect on the utility of consumption
for beer and wine (the outside good).

22

We ignore any dynamic considerations to distillers’ pricing decisions based on regulatory restrictions on their
pricing. While the PLCB limits the number of times distillers can temporarily change a product’s price to four,
this regulation does not constrain upstream pricing for the majority of products. In the data, 73.5% of products
go on sale three times or less.

In vertical retail pricing markets, ∆p can be a complicated object (see Villas-Boas, 2007).
In our context, however, the state’s regulation of alcohol sales simplifies this matrix significantly by

cost estimates facilitate the evaluation of alternative pricing regulations to analyze the aggregate
and distributional consequences of the simple uniform markup policy. Modifications to the pricing

4 Estimation Results
We adapt the estimation approach of Nevo (2000) to the institutional features surrounding the
price regulation of spirits in Pennsylvania. As in Miravete et al. (2017), we follow a three-step
estimation procedure that takes advantage of the fact that the PLCB charges the same retail price
for a given product in all local markets. This allows us to separately identify the contribution to
demand of demographic taste heterogeneity across the state at a point in time and the contribution
of time varying shifters of demand that are common across demographic groups, including price. In
the first-stage, we use generalized method of moments techniques to estimate the determinants of
deviations from a product’s mean utility µijlt , controlling for market and product by pricing period
fixed effects that absorb the mean effects of price, product characteristics, and seasonality. In
the second stage, we employ instrumental variables techniques to project the estimated product by
pricing period fixed effects onto price, seasonality, and product fixed effects, using contemporaneous
prices in distant control states and input prices as instruments. Last, we project the estimated
product fixed effects from the second stage onto time-invariant product characteristics.
Identification of random coefficients Σ relies on correlation between a product’s market share
and its characteristics relative to other more or less similar products; see Berry and Haile (2014).
We construct two instruments similar to those used in Bresnahan, Stern and Trajtenberg (1997).
First, we employ the number of products in the market that share product j’s characteristic. For
example, to identify taste variation for brandies, we use the total number of competing brandies
of the same bottle size in location l in period t as the instrument for a given brandy. Second,
we use spirit product scores from Proof66.com as a measure of product quality and compute the
average distance, measured in squared deviations, of product j to other products that share its
characteristic. Thus, for the above brandy, this would be the average distance in product score
space from other brandies available in market l at time t. This instrument provides additional
identifying power since it captures differential effects on market shares of offering a high-quality
brandy in a market with other high quality brandies relative to an alternative market largely
populated by lower quality brandies.
Similarly, identification of demographic interactions Π is based on correlation between
the market shares of products with particular characteristics in a given store market and the
demographics of the population served by each store. We interact the above two instruments with
the prevalence of a given demographic attribute in each market. For example, we would identify the
differential taste of young households for the above brandy by interacting the number of brandies
and the brandies’ quality level with the share of young consumers in each market. To identify the
effect of the income and price interaction, we construct similar instruments based on the number
of products sharing a given product’s price category (cheap vs. expensive) interacted with the
share of households in the market with income above $50,000. Berry and Haile (2010) point out
that these “Waldfogel” instruments (Waldfogel, 2003) are valid provided there exist no demand
spillovers from consumers in other similar markets.

Variation in prices over time identifies the price coefficient α, exploiting the fact that
distillers do not change the wholesale prices pw for all products at the same time. We identify
seasonality and mean preferences β for time-invariant product characteristics such as proof and
spirit type from systematic variation in market shares of spirits by time period or characteristic.
We present the estimation algorithm in detail in Appendix C where we also discuss potential sources
of price endogeneity stemming from responses by distillers to unobserved demand shocks (via ξ),
and the use of input costs and retail prices in other control states as instruments to address such
possible confounding.
4.1 Parameter Estimates
Table 7 presents the demand estimates of our preferred specification of the mixed-logit model.23
Parameters are very precisely estimated and the estimated demand specification captures the
documented patterns of spirit consumption across demographic groups (Table 6).
We allow for rich variation across demographics by interacting consumer age and indicators
for minority and high educational attainment with proof and indicators for spirit type, bottle size,
and import status. The estimates of Π reveal significant differences in tastes for spirits across
demographic groups. While minority consumers favor brandy, cordials and rum over gin, the
reference category, older and college-educated consumers prefer gin to cordials and rum, all else
equal. We also find that older consumers and to a lesser extent college educated consumers, are more
likely to purchase 1.75 L than 750 ml bottles, our reference category, while minority households
are more likely to purchase 375 ml bottles. Estimated demand for wealthier consumers is steeper,
which is consistent with the increased consumption of expensive spirits by “high income” consumers
reported in Table 6. Older and particularly minority consumers also favor spirits with higher proof.
We allow for unobserved variation in preferences for a number of the product characteristics,
including proof and certain bottle sizes, product categories, and import status. The estimated
random coefficients are large, in particular for brandies and for the 375 ml size, indicating that
even after controlling for the significant degree of observed differences in tastes on average and by
demographic groups, there still exist further similarities between products in these categories that
influence their substitution patterns. Lastly, we find that demand increases during the summer
and the holiday season and that, on average, consumers prefer products of higher quality and lower
proof and favor cordials, rums, and vodkas over gins and brandy.
4.2 Elasticities
Next, we translate the parameter estimates into own-price elasticities that we summarize in Table 8.
At the product level, we estimate an average own-price elasticity of −3.75, which is within the
range of median elasticities of Conlon and Rao (2015, Table 8) for spirits (from −2.61 for whiskeys
23

In Appendix D we show that our estimation results are robust to arbitrage on the state border (i.e., the “border
bleed”), other samples, and alternative instrumentation approaches.

to −3.80 for vodkas), and somewhat more elastic than the −2.41 own-price elasticity of wine
estimate of Aguirregabiria et al. (2016). Our model estimates imply an estimated price elasticity
of off-premise spirit demand of −2.48 overall, more elastic than the −1.5 estimate of Leung and
Phelps (1993) in their review of the literature on demand estimation for alcoholic beverages. We
attribute this difference to our exclusion (due to lack of data) of the on-premise consumption in
bars and restaurants, which is likely less price sensitive than off-premise consumption.24
24

Perhaps more important, most earlier studies use aggregate consumption data at the state-level whereas we have
detailed local data on consumption choices. To corroborate this hypothesis, Appendix D shows that aggregation

“Price” denotes the average price in the relevant category measured in dollars.

Most relevant to our research question is that the own price elasticity estimates exhibit
substantial heterogeneity across spirit types and bottle sizes, thus questioning the optimality of a
single markup across products. The empirical distribution of estimated price elasticities has the
largest spread for brandy and gin and the lowest for rums. A uniform increase in the PLCB ’s
markup will thus trigger a non-uniform response of demand across spirit varieties. The bottom
of Table 8 shows that demand responses to a uniform increase of retail prices vary more widely
across bottle sizes and price segments than across spirit types. The demand for 375 ml bottles is
less elastic than for 1.75 L bottles, with the 750 ml bottles in-between. Similarly, we also find that
demand for expensive products is more elastic than the nearly half as expensive cheap spirits.
In Table 9 we summarize demand heterogeneity by comparing sales-weighted average elasticities across markets, thereby providing evidence supporting Posner’s claim that a one-size-fits-all
policy leads to cross-subsidies in the presence of a heterogenous population. In markets with
a predominance of high-income, college-educated, and, to a lesser extent, high-risk consumers,
demand is significantly less price responsive than in markets with concentrations of lower income,
less educated, and moderate drinkers. Across products, the demand responsiveness is similar in
markets with low and high concentrations of minority consumers, but this aggregate pattern masks
significant heterogeneity by spirit types: demands for cordials, gins, and rums are slightly less
elastic, and more elastic than average for the remaining spirit types in markets with large shares
of minorities. Overall, the large degree of variation in estimated elasticities across spirit types and
demographics corroborates the existence of substantial preference heterogeneity.
in our data set drives the price coefficient (and consequently the estimated elasticity for spirits) toward zero.
Appendix D also evaluates the sensitivity of our estimates to alternative samples and instrumentation strategies.

Notes: Statistics are average product elasticity in the relevant category-demographic pair. “High” refers to markets in the top
20% while “Low” refers to markets in the bottom 20% for the corresponding demographic trait. Demographic categories defined
in Section 2.4.

Random coefficients (Σ) and demographic interactions (Π) allows for flexible substitution
patterns across observable characteristics, particularly bottle size and select spirit types. Our
estimates indicate that the cross-price elasticity for two products in the same bottle size category
is, on average, 1.79 times greater than for product pairs of different bottle sizes (see Table E.1).
We also estimate cross-price elasticities for two products of the same spirit type to be 8.9 times
greater than for product pairs across spirit types. Brandies appear to be a particularly well defined
segment as the large estimated random coefficient in this category implies cross-price elasticities
between two brandies that are 39.21 times greater, on average, than those between a brandy and
a product of a different spirit type. Cordials, on the other hand, are heterogenous as reflected by
an average cross-price elasticity within spirit type of only 1.3 times that across spirit types.
4.3 Implied Upstream Marginal Cost
The theoretical model from Section 3 laid out how consumers and upstream distillers respond to
any chosen retail pricing policy by the PLCB . To consider the response in upstream behavior to
retail pricing policy alternatives, we require an estimate of the upstream firms’ marginal costs.
Beginning with our demand estimates, we assume Bertrand–Nash pricing behavior by upstream
firms to recover the marginal cost that renders the observed wholesale prices optimal under the
current pricing policy and observed ownership structure according to the first-order conditions in
equation (12). We rely on these marginal cost estimates in conducting our counterfactual analysis.
We find that the marginal costs of expensive products are on average 2.7 times higher than
of inexpensive products and that brandies and whiskey are the least and most costly products,

respectively, to manufacture on average (see Table E.2 in Appendix E). If brandies and whiskeys
are aged more than four years, their marginal costs are approximately 1.5 times higher than of
non-aged products. Imported products have 1.8 times the marginal cost of non-imported products
on average, reflecting increased transportation costs and import tariffs that the upstream firms pay.
Our cost estimates further indicate that upstream firms have significant market power
(Table 10) as they, on average, enjoy a Lerner index of 36.5% – that is for every dollar in revenue
the average product yields 36 cents in profit. Products manufactured by larger firms like Diageo
and Bacardi tend to have lower Lerner indices (roughly 34%) while smaller manufacturers such as
Jacquin and Sazerac operate more niche product portfolios (Table 4) and earn 46.5% and 42.3% of
each dollar in revenue, respectively. Across products, cheap and 375 ml products tend to be more
profitable for all manufacturers while expensive and 1.75 L products tend to have lower Lerner
indices.
The presence of upstream market power illustrates two points. First, current policy may
implicitly redistribute rents between firms or even enable these firms to extract additional rents from
consumers and/or the PLCB . Second, upstream firms possess the ability to respond to changes in
policy – a factor that we must account for in solving for the equilibrium of any alternative policy.

5 What Does the Single Markup Rule Achieve?
In this section we use the estimates of consumer demand and distillers’ marginal costs to identify
the winners and losers of the single markup policy among upstream distillers and downstream
consumers. As the PLCB ’s single markup policy amounts to a uniform consumption tax, our
analysis seeks to broadly identify common traits of winners and losers of uniform taxation.

– 24 –

We identify winners and losers by comparing the observed equilibrium to a series of alternative policies. In all of the policies we restrict attention to variation in the ad valorem markup and
hold unit fees fixed at current levels as they are purportedly linked to transportation costs only.
Focusing on the ad valorem markup also allows for generalization of our results beyond Pennsylvania
since nearly all states in the US (liquor control or otherwise) employ simple ad valorem excise taxes
on alcohol. We also assume the value of the outside option is invariant to the policies we consider,
which implicitly fixes retail beer and wine prices. This is a reasonable simplification in our context
since the retail beer distribution is competitive and retail wine prices are controlled by the PLCB .25
We restrict attention to subsidy-free Stackelberg equilibria in which our alternative policies
generate at least as much tax revenue as generated by the current policy. The implicit assumption
therefore is that state government must meet its budget constraint. We model each alternative
policy as a two-stage Stackelberg game in which the regulator chooses its policy anticipating the
distillers’ optimal price responses. We allow upstream distillers to re-optimize their wholesale
pricing decisions to maximize their profit in response to policy changes and solve for the markup
policy that maximizes the government’s objective. We thus account not only for the direct effect of
changing the pricing rule, the mechanical effect, but also for the adjustment of firms and consumers
or the behavioral response to policy (Saez, 2001). Accounting for the strategic response of firms
stands in contrast to the optimal taxation literature where assuming perfect competition among
firms is common. For all policies we assume upstream firms maximize profits by choosing the set
of wholesale prices for the products in their portfolio (Equation 12).
5.1 Does the Single Markup Policy Maximize Tax Revenue?
The PLCB was originally founded to discourage alcohol consumption to limit the external costs
of alcohol. Today, the PLCB generates significant revenue for the state’s general fund. Recent
legislation furthermore supports the hypothesis that the state government uses it solely to generate
tax revenue.26 As our demand estimation allowed us to be agnostic about the state’s objective, we
begin by evaluating whether the single markup is effective at generating tax revenue.
We do so by comparing the current equilibrium to three alternative PLCB policies and
present the results in Table 11. We initially compare the current 30% single markup with the
25

We do not capture effects of alternative spirit pricing policies on tax revenue from wine sales or beer distributor and
restaurant license fees. Relative to spirits, wine purchases account for only 40% of the tax revenue generated by
state liquor stores. Substitution to off-premise beer or consumption of alcohol in restaurants is likely limited, due
to increasing product dissimilarity and different points of sale. Meng, Brennan, Purshouse, Hill-McManus, Angus,
Holmes and Meier (2014) find very small elasticities of substitution between the on- and off-premise markets
(suggesting that optimal license fees remain largely unaffected by changes in spirit pricing). They also find small
cross-price elasticities between beer and spirits (0.113) and wine and spirits (0.163).

In June 2016 Pennsylvania governor Tom Wolf signed House Bill 1690 into law as Act 39 of 2016. Act 39, which
took effect in August 2016, granted the PLCB “common retail marketing abilities including pricing flexibility”
in allowing it to price its best-selling items, defined as the top-selling 150 SKUs, “in a manner that maximizes
the return on the sale of those items.” Full text available at http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/li/
uconsCheck.cfm?yr=2016&sessInd=0&act=39. At the time of this writing, the PLCB has taken advantage of this
pricing flexibility only a limited number of times.

Notes: “Current ” denotes the current scenario with the 30% markup rule. “Single” is the scenario
where the PLCB maximizes tax revenue with just one markup. “Type” adds flexibility by using 9
common markups defined by spirit type and bottle size while “Product” employs 312 product-specific
markups to maximize tax revenue. All counterfactuals Stackelberg equilibria where the regulator

single markup that maximizes tax revenue – a policy we call “Single.” We find that the current
markup policy achieves 99.6% of the potential tax revenue afforded by a single markup rule. The
small increase in tax revenue requires a modest decrease in the single markup from 30% to 23.7%
as the regulator anticipates distillers’ response: an increase in average wholesale price from $8.69
to $8.82 per bottle. The upstream distiller response partially undoes the reduction in markup as
average retail price declines from $14.87 to $14.41 per bottle, or 3.1%. This decrease in retail price
leads to an 8.1% increase in the number of bottles sold. Interestingly, the distiller response enables
these firms to increase their profits by 13.5% – a substantial improvement. Miravete et al. (2017)
find similar results under broader assumptions of upstream conduct. Hence, reducing the PLCB ’s
uniform tax rate to 23.7% increases industry profits by $16.15 million, but 94.4% is captured by
upstream firms. We conclude that the PLCB ’s 30% single markup appears broadly to maximize
tax revenue within the confines of uniform markup policies but that small deviations are largely
captured by upstream firms.
The use of a uniform rate is common practice for the taxation of goods and services although
it is unlikely that such a policy would maximize tax revenue when demand elasticity estimates vary
across products, consumers, and firms. This suggests the PLCB is leaving money on the table by
not leveraging these differences – a point reinforced by the “Single” Stackelberg equilibrium where
distillers leveraged their product-level pricing power to extract the majority of any incremental
profits generated by deviations in the single markup.

– 26 –

In the “Product” column of Table 11, we present the Stackelberg equilibrium when the
PLCB leverages the differences across products by choosing the vector of 312 product-specific
(e.g., Bacardi Dry, 750 ml) state-wide markups that maximize aggregate tax revenue. Adding
flexibility to the pricing rule leads to an increase in the average markup from 30% to 55.5%. This
average change masks significant variation among the heterogenous products. For instance, much
of the increase stems from products with relatively inelastic demand: under the new policy the
PLCB applies markups of 62.1% and 53.4% on average for 375 ml bottle and brandy products,
respectively. Products with estimated demands that are more elastic, however, are marked up less:
expensive products and 1.75 L bottle products are taxed 37.3% and 39.3% on average, respectively.
Distillers respond by decreasing average wholesale price by 3.3% from $8.69 to $8.40; the large
wholesale price reductions occur in the 375 ml bottle category (−23.9%), among cheap products
(−9.9%), and brandies (−9.9%).27 These price reductions ultimately limit the average retail price
increase to consumers to only 14 cents from $14.87 to $15.01. The aggregate number of bottles
sold increases by 2.2%.
The increased flexibility in the markup policy enables the PLCB to increase tax revenues
$24.68 million or 9.7% of current revenues – a significant improvement. Integrated industry profits
rise by 6.4% while total upstream profits decrease about 1%. Hence, the PLCB is able to capture
the bulk of the incremental industry profits generated by the shift in its policy, which stands in stark
contrast to the case when the regulator is constrained to a single markup. By allowing markups to
vary by product and leveraging differences in demand across products, the PLCB extracts market
power from upstream firms.
One may argue that the product-specific markups we consider in “Product” are unnecessarily complex and thus not feasible (despite being common practice in the private sector). In column
“Type” in Table 11 we report the results of a policy where rather than charging a markup per
product we restrict the PLCB to only 9 markups based on bottle size (3) and spirit type (6) where
the markup mj for a product j of bottle size b and spirit type c is mj = mb + mc , where b = 1, ..., 3,
and c = 1, ..., 6. This is a similar policy to the one employed in Vermont and enables the PLCB to
target the heterogeneous preferences of consumers, albeit in a coarser way.
This less flexible pricing policy falls between the “Single” and “Product” policies: average
retail prices fall by less than under the optimal uniform markup policy and distillers reduce their
wholesale prices by a lesser magnitude. Using only 9 markups to address consumer heterogeneity
enables the PLCB to increase tax revenue $8.20 million, or 34.5% of the potential tax revenue
increase from moving to fully flexible, product-specific markups. Distillers are much better off
under this policy than under product-level markups as they retain their ability to price products
individually, increasing profits by 7.4%, or $8.42 million, relative to the “Product” scenario.
In summary, does the PLCB maximize tax revenue? Our analysis offers a two-pronged
answer: Within the set of single markup policies, the PLCB ’s 30% markup rule generates almost the
27

– 27 –

maximum tax revenue possible. However, a more flexible product-specific markup policy increases
tax revenue by 9.7% even after accounting for the pricing response of upstream distillers. We show
that product-specific markups enable the PLCB to increase tax revenue by leveraging differences in
demand elasticities that not only leads to an increase in quantity sold, but also enables the PLCB
to capture a greater percentage of industry profits. A simpler policy based on markups by spirit
type and bottle size captures about a third of these potential incremental profits.
5.2 Measuring Redistribution from Single Markup Pricing
In this section we use the estimated structural model to identify winners and losers of the single
markup policy among the regulated upstream firms and consumers, i.e., we measure Posner’s
taxation-by-regulation. We do so by comparing the observed equilibrium under the uniform single
markup to the subsidy-free Stackelberg equilibrium where the PLCB chooses product-level markups
(i.e., “Product”) and internalizes the diverse set of own and cross-price demand elasticities of the
regulated products. This comparison therefore illuminates the implicit cross-subsidies envisioned
by Posner.
The idea that regulation can benefit a select few is of course not new. Stigler (1971) first
articulated the hypothesis that regulation mostly served the interests of the firms in the regulated
industry.28 However, at least some consumers might also benefit from regulation. Laffont and
Tirole (1993, §3.9) note that the cross-subsidization of certain population groups by others, for
instance via a single markup rule, can be optimal if the regulator intentionally distorts prices to
favor a targeted class of consumers.
5.2.1 Taxation by Regulation Among Upstream Distillers
Our analysis begins in the upstream distillery market where we evaluate the induced redistribution
of profits among upstream distillers. We hypothesize that PLCB policy impacts each of these
firms differently – a point we confirm in Table 12 – since distillers operate very different product
portfolios (Table 4) and face consumers with different tastes (Table 6).
We find the PLCB ’s single markup policy increases market power in the upstream market
and transfers profits from large firms like Diageo and Bacardi to small firms like Jacquin. As
discussed above, the implementation of product-specific markups over the current policy leads to
an average reduction in wholesale prices of 3.3%. Much of this decline is driven by smaller firms
like Jacquin and Sazerac who lower their prices by 13.2% and 14%, respectively. In contrast, the
reduction in wholesale price for large multi-product distillers like Diageo, Beam, and Bacardi is
much smaller, 1.77%, 4.1%, and 1.3% on average, respectively. This reflects the ability of these
28

Peltzman (1976) built on this view to consider consumers and other interest groups that may influence the design
of regulatory rules and eventually the redistribution of rents among constituencies through the political process.
These theories of regulation build upon the influential work by Olson (1965) on collective action and politics. Noll
(1989) summarizes the political economy aspects of regulatory capture and Laffont and Tirole (1993, §11) elegantly
formalize it within a principal-agent model of regulation.

firms to modify the wholesale prices of their large product portfolios to offset reduced profits from
a subset of products.
In terms of profitability, product-level markups entail declines in price cost margins for
all firms, though not all firms are worse off as increases in quantity sold offset lower margins for
some: e.g., profits for Diageo and Bacardi increase under product-level markups by 6.4% ($1.71
million) and 20% ($1.99 million), respectively. This growth comes at the expense of smaller, more
specialized firms like Jacquin, whose profits decrease significantly under this alternative policy;
Jacquin is a clear beneficiary of the single markup.
While Jacquin’s success under the single markup fits the narrative of Jordan’s Producer
Protection argument for regulation (Jordan, 1972), we hypothesize that this result amounts to
a “home bias” effect where the firm’s success stems from its focus on selling cheap products
(Table 4) that are relatively inelastic (Table 8). In Table E.3 we show that the PLCB ’s single
markup policy under-prices these products, leading to greater upstream market power in this
segment (Table 10). Thus, it could be that the company’s management chose a business strategy
that exploits a regulatory policy in its home market. In contrast, large firms like Diageo and
Bacardi sell products throughout the world and are subject to a diverse set of regulations, so they
gain less from developing a product set to exploit any one particular state’s regulatory policy. The
fact that Jacquin is at best the 18th largest distiller based on unit sales in any of the other liquor
control states supports this hypothesis.
5.2.2 Taxation by Regulation Among Consumers
In this section we continue our analysis of taxation-by-regulation and ask: Does the single markup
benefit certain consumer groups? As above, we use product-level markups as the alternative policy
to identify the implicit redistribution generated by the single markup and note that our results are
robust to a large set of alternative policies (See Table E.4).
We begin with a discussion of changes in retail price (Figure 2, panel a) where we compare
equilibrium prices under the single markup to the equilibrium prices under product-level markups.

Notes: Statistics represent percent change from the Stackelberg equilibria under the alternative markup policy to the one
observed under the current 30% markup rule. Percent change in retail price is weighted by market shares in the data to capture
differences in demand across demographic groups. Average of markets with top and bottom 20% of age, minority, education,
and incomeas defined in Table 5. “Risk” is defined in Section 2.4. In panel (b) we present the distribution of compensating
variation {CVl }454
l=1 , denominated in thousands of dollars.

To reflect differences in preferences across consumer types, we first calculate the average retail
price of each market under each policy using quantity sold under the current single markup rule
as weights. We then compute the percent change of the average retail price in each market under
the 30% single markup relative to the alternative policy. Thus, a positive change indicates that
consumers pay a higher price under the current 30% markup for the products they favor than under
product-level markups.
Panel (a) indicates that by ignoring the heterogenous preferences documented in Tables 6
and 8, the current 30% single markup rule induces substantial price distortions that vary systematically with demographic traits. For instance, the current regulation results in underpricing of spirits
by 2.4% in the least affluent markets while overpricing them by 0.7% in wealthy neighborhoods –
a 3.1 percentage point difference across consumers of top and bottom income quintiles. A similar
result arises when we classify markets by the share of population with some college education (and
to a lesser extent with population age), which is highly correlated with income.
The intuition behind these results is as follows. Recall that lower income consumers prefer
375 ml and cheap products (Section 2.4) and that the estimated demand for these products
are relatively inelastic (Section 4.2). Upstream firms set wholesale prices for products in their
product set taking into account differences in demand across products and the PLCB ’s markup
policy (Equation 12), but they are limited in the degree to which they can extract consumer
surplus because they compete with other firms. The PLCB on the other hand faces no downstream
competition and its policy affects all upstream firms and products. When it enacts the more flexible
“Product” markup policy, it is therefore able to more fully internalize these differences in demand.
The net result is that the regulator chooses markups that increase the average equilibrium retail
prices of 375 ml and cheap products (Table E.3), which adversely affects consumers who prefer
these products.

Notes: In the first column we report the marginal effects of a probit model
relating observable demographics to market mean compensating variations
of the product-specific relative to the current market outcome. Dependent
variable is equal to one when a market has mean compensating variation less
than zero. Robust standard errors reported in between parentheses. The
R2 statistic is McFadden’s pseudo-R2 . In the rightmost column we regress
compensating variation divided by total liquor expenditure in market l on
market demographic characteristics. All regressions include a constant (not
reported). age is log(average age) in the location. education, income, and
minority are defined in Table 5.

These changes in retail price translate to changes in consumer welfare. We define welfare as
compensating variation; a negative mean compensating variation in location l indicates the average
amount a consumer in the market would be willing to pay the state to switch to the product-level
markup policy. See Section 3.1.1. In Figure 2, panel (b) we see that some (16.7%) consumers
benefit from the single markup though most (83.3%) consumers are worse off under the current
policy.29
In Table 13 we project the distribution of mean compensating variation onto consumer
demographics. In the left column we look for systematic differences between areas where mean
compensating variation is positive: i.e., we look to identify common characteristics among the
16.7% of residents who benefit from the single markup. We do so via a simple probit model where
the dependent variable is equal to one when a market has mean compensating variation greater
than zero. Again, we find that less educated, lower income, and minority households tend to benefit
from the current 30% single markup policy.
In the rightmost column we measure how mean compensating variation in each market
varies with demographics where we normalize market l compensating variation (CVl ) by liquor
expenditure in market l control for differences in market size. We find that the effect of education
is nearly double that of income: on average, increasing the share of households with some college
education by one percentage point is associated with a reduction in consumer surplus of twice the
29

To make these numbers more concrete, we find that 18% of our store locations have mean compensating variation
greater than zero. After weighting each location by the local drinking-age population, we find that 16.7% consumers
benefit from the single markup.

amount associated with a one percentage point increase in the share of high-income households.
The effect of income, in turn, is approximately twice the size of the effect associated with the share
of minority households; an increasing prevalence of minority households is, however, associated
with increases in consumer surplus. In summary, our results indicate that less educated, lower
income, and minority households tend to benefit from the single markup as the policy generates
lower equilibrium retail prices for the products they prefer. To our knowledge, the redistribution
due to alcohol taxation has not been documented before.
5.3 Optimal Taxation
In this section we evaluate the aggregate welfare consequences of the single markup. Of course, a
product-specific markup policy that maximizes tax revenue is not likely to also maximize consumer
surplus. Ramsey (1927) showed that to minimize efficiency costs associated with raising a given
amount of tax revenue, the regulator should tax each product as a function of its demand elasticity
– a similar mechanism to the product-level markups we consider above. In Table 14, we therefore
evaluate the single markup’s optimality by comparing it to alternative policies that set tax rates by
product. In “Ramsey” we solve for the Pareto improving policy that maximizes consumer surplus
by optimally setting a vector of 312 product markups subject to the budget constraint of generating
at least the same revenues as current policy.
In both the earlier “Product” and the current “Ramsey” policies, we compare the current
equilibrium to one in which the PLCB maximizes an objective – either tax revenue or consumer
surplus given a tax revenue target – that does not account for any negative externalities from alcohol
consumption. Implicitly, we have thus assumed that the external costs of alcohol consumption are
negligible and largely internalized by consumers, or that, for whatever reason, the state chooses
not to manage the externality.
Here, we consider the opposite alternative, where we assume that the primary objective
of the PLCB ’s pricing is to manage alcohol consumption. This is motivated by the fact that
identifying and measuring the external costs of ethanol consumption is difficult and an open topic
of research in the public health literature (see Greenfield et al., 2009; Bouchery et al., 2011; Sacks
et al., 2013). We therefore incorporate the externality into the government’s problem in a simple
way: we assume that the government uses the full amount of PLCB tax revenue to offset the
external costs of ethanol consumption. This allows us to estimate the average equilibrium shadow
externality as the PLCB ’s observed tax revenue per liter of ethanol contained in its aggregate sales.
We denote this average externality cost by λ; it amounts to the PLCB ’s tax revenue of $255.70
million divided by the 16.54 million liters of ethanol sold, or λ = $15.46.
Is this a reasonable estimate of the externality? Bouchery et al. (2011) and Sacks et al.
(2013) provide estimates of the external costs of alcohol consumption borne by the Pennsylvania
state government during this period. Taken together, their results indicate that the state government paid $0.43 per U.S. standard drink (i.e., 17.7 ml of ethanol) in alcohol-related costs, or

– 32 –

equivalently $24.29 per liter of ethanol.30 If we further exclude estimated costs attributable to “lost
productivity” due to premature mortality and absenteeism (45.4% of total expense), the estimated
external cost falls to $13.36 per liter of ethanol.31 Thus, our simple estimate of $15.46 appears to
be a reasonable approximation.
We use this estimated average external cost to formulate an alternative Ramsey pricing
problem that considers whether the government can improve consumer welfare by moving to
product-specific pricing while at least covering the associated external costs with tax revenue.
Sandmo (1976) and, more recently, Kopczuk (2003) show that the optimal Ramsey pricing problem
with externalities can be separated into two independent problems jointly defining the markup
charged for each product: a Pigouvian tax targeting the externality and deviations from the
resulting prices based on demand elasticities to meet revenue targets.32 We find optimal prices that
allow the government to maximize aggregate consumer surplus, subject to an externality-adjusted
budget constraint:
T (pr ) − λ × E(pr ) ≥ 0
where T (pr ) is aggregate tax revenue, E(pr ) is aggregate ethanol consumption (in liters), pr is the
vector of equilibrium retail prices, and λ = $15.46 is the external cost of ethanol consumption. In
a slight abuse of nomenclature, we call this policy “Pigou” and note that rather than assigning
markups / taxes according to the marginal external cost of ethanol consumption, we rely on the
average. We compare the aggregate effects of this alternative policy to the base Ramsey policy in
Table 14.
We find that aggregate consumer welfare increases under all of the more flexible taxation
policies we consider, including under product-level markups designed to maximize tax revenue with
no emphasis on consumer welfare (“Product”). This is an interesting result since the aggregate
impact to consumers of more flexible pricing is theoretically ambiguous. One contribution of the
paper therefore is to provide an empirical example where a uniform consumption tax not only left
money on the table, but also decreased consumer welfare.
Moreover, our results indicate the 30% single markup is far from optimal. Absent any
externalities, consumers are far better off under the “Ramsey” solution as aggregate consumer
welfare increases $95.08 million, or 15.4% of total observed liquor expenditure, due to lower
equilibrium retail prices on average and an increase in quantity sold. Accounting for the external
costs associated with alcohol consumption leads the PLCB to choose markups closer to the earlier
product-level markups that maximize tax revenue (i.e., “Product”) as the $18.32 million increase in
30

Sacks et al. (2013) presents total alcohol-related costs by state. In Bouchery et al. (2011) they decompose the total
expense attributable to alcohol consumption by payer, including state and federal government.

31

The remaining costs are due to health care expenses from treatment of alcohol-related diseases (12.7% of total)
plus “other costs” ranging from property damage to incarceration for alcohol-related crimes (41.7% of total). See
Bouchery et al. (2011, Table 2).

Conlon and Rao (2015, Appendix 2) present the formal solution of the Pigouvian Tax and Ramsey Pricing solutions
in the context of alcohol taxation in Connecticut while Griffith et al. (2017) study alcohol taxation using consumer
survey data and an assumed functional form for the externality function.

tax revenue compensates for the 7.1% increase in ethanol consumption. In aggregate consumers are
better off by $56.68 million, or 9.2% of their liquor expenditure under “Pigou” taxes. Interestingly,
all consumers prefer the “Ramsey” and “Pigou” taxes whereas 16.7% of consumers preferred the
30% single markup to “Product” taxes.
5.4 What is the PLCB’s Objective?
Thus far we have not taken a stand regarding the objective of the state legislature in crafting
the single markup policy. Instead, we have shown that by restricting the PLCB to a 30% single
markup policy, the Pennsylvania state legislature leaves money on the table, decreases aggregate
welfare, and generates significant redistribution across consumers and firms. We have therefore
identified the implicit effects without addressing whether these results are the explicit choice of the
regulator or merely the unintended consequence of a policy adopted by a regulator. In this section
we interpret our results under different government objectives.
First, it could be that the state relies on the PLCB solely to generate tax revenue for the
state’s general fund. If true, our results indicate that allowing more flexible pricing (e.g., “Product”
and “Ramsey” policies) would increase tax revenue and consumer welfare. The state legislature’s
2016 passage of Act 39 granted the PLCB “common retail marketing abilities including pricing
flexibility [to set prices on popular products] in a manner that maximizes the return on the sale of
those items,” which provides supportive evidence of this hypothesis. If true, our results highlight
that the simple uniform markup both fails to meet this objective and generates redistribution
among heterogenous consumers and firms.
A second hypothesis is that the regulator indeed cares about the external costs of alcohol
consumption. In Section 5.1 we established that the 30% single-markup forgoes 24.68 million
in tax revenue, but it also reduces alcohol consumption by 2.1% in terms of bottles and 8.5%
in terms of liters of ethanol. Our demand estimates imply that the 30% markup employed by
the PLCB is statistically significantly different from the tax revenue maximizing single markup

– 34 –

of 23.7%. We therefore cannot reject the possibility that the state overprices spirits in order to
reduce consumption. If we define the average shadow value of consumption as foregone tax revenue
divided by foregone consumption, the 30% single-markup implies a shadow value of $16.24 per
liter of ethanol. Interestingly, this figure is remarkably close to our estimated average external cost
under the assumption that PLCB tax revenue is used to fully offset government expenditure related
to alcohol consumption. Our results in the “Pigou” alternative policy indicate that more flexible
pricing would simultaneously increase aggregate consumer welfare while generating sufficient tax
revenue to cover the costs of alcohol consumption. Thus, the single markup is again sub-optimal.
In both of the above two hypotheses our results amount to measuring the cross-subsidies as
well as identifying winners and losers of a simple policy that was not seeking redistribution explicitly.
Interestingly, proponents of simple policies often argue that such policies are inherently fair as they
treat all citizens equally. Our results indicate just the opposite. If the managerial decision-making
costs or political feasibility of implementing and maintaining product-level taxes, or something close
to it, were sufficiently high, one could also rationalize the use of the single markup. The recent
change in Pennsylvania’s pricing regulation stands in contrast to this argument.
An alternative hypothesis is that redistribution might actually be the objective of a regulator
(or state legislature) that understands the cross-subsidies simple policy generate. If so, our results
provide evidence that governments can use the cross-subsidies generated by simple policy to favor
key constituent groups. We find that, compared to all of the alternative policies we consider,
the single markup favors less educated, lower income, and minority households by generating lower
equilibrium retail prices for the products they prefer, albeit at the expense of significant tax revenue.
It is therefore possible that the PLCB ’s markup rule is a purposeful effort to curry favor with pivotal
constituent groups. Testing this hypothesis however requires formally rationalizing the 30% single
markup as the outcome of a political equilibrium where state representatives weigh foregone tax
revenue against voter approval – a difficult task that we leave as an interesting and important
avenue for future research.

6 Concluding Remarks
In this paper we studied the redistributive effects of simple policy when agents have heterogeneous preferences over outcomes. We focus on the regulation of spirits where we observe the
pricing decisions of all upstream firms as well as the final retail prices faced by heterogenous
consumers. In our setting, the regulator is legally-mandated to charge a uniform 30% markup on
all horizontally-differentiated products it sells in state-run stores. We find significant heterogeneity
in the consumption patterns of different consumer types as well as heterogeneity in the product
portfolios offered by the upstream suppliers; hence, a uniform policy likely generates winners and
losers among both firms and consumers. Restricting policy to a single markup or tax has significant
effects on firms, consumers, as well as the state. This paper therefore not only contributes to our

– 35 –

understanding of optimal taxation, it also amounts, to the best of our knowledge, as the first
empirical evidence of Posner’s taxation-by-regulation argument.
Our counterfactual analysis allowed product-level markups to account for differences in
demand across products but we maintained the PLCB ’s policy of charging the same price for each
product across all local stores at a given point in time. Common pricing across nearby areas, but not
across products, is also standard in private retailing industries as it avoids arbitrage concerns across
stores and, as shown by Della Vigna and Gentzkow (2017), reduced managerial decision-making
costs. Allowing for such zone pricing is an interesting area for future research as coarse spatial price
discrimination might provide regulators with sufficient policy instruments to increase tax revenues
without necessarily increasing alcohol consumption.

Appendix
A Data
In this section we discuss the data in more detail. We begin with a discussion of how we aggregate
the initial daily, store-level PLCB data and how we define market areas served by each store. We
also address the possibility of stock-outs and how we link the available demographic information
to our geographic market definition.
To reduce the size of the estimation sample, we consider the periodicity with which we
observe price changes in the data. PLCB regulation in place during our sample period allows price
to change only for two reasons: permanent and temporary wholesale price changes. Both follow set
timing requirements. Permanent price changes can take effect on the first day of one of the PLCB ’s
four-week long accounting reporting periods. Temporary sales, on the other hand, begin on the last
Monday of each month and last for either four or five weeks until the day before the last Monday
of the following month. Reporting periods and temporary sales periods thus align largely, but not
perfectly. To recognize that temporary price reductions are more prevalent than permanent ones
(89.7% of price changes in the sample are temporary in nature) and avoid having multiple very
short periods, we use sales periods as our time interval. In case of permanent price changes that
take effect at the beginning of a reporting period that bisects two sales periods, we assume that
the price change takes effect in the sales period that most overlaps with the given reporting period.
This results in 22 “pricing periods” during which prices remain constant. In aggregating our daily
sales data to the level of sales during a pricing period, we treat a product as being available in a
store if we observe a sale at least once during a given pricing period. The length of the pricing
period alleviates concern about distinguishing product availability from lack of sales in the period.
Stores exhibit significant variation in the product composition of purchases. These differences reflect heterogeneity in consumer preferences more than differences in the availability of
products across stores: Of the 100 best selling products statewide in 2003, the median store carried
98.0%, while a store at the fifth percentile carried 72.0% of these products. Similarly, of the 1000
best selling products statewide in 2003, the median store carried 82.0%, while a store at the fifth
percentile carried 44.2% of the products. The product availability at designated “premium” stores
is somewhat better than the average, with the median premium store carrying all of the top 100
products and 95.1% of the top 1000 products. In addition, a customer can request to have any
regular product in the PLCB ’s product catalog shipped to his local store for free, should that store
not carry the product. In Figure A.1 we demonstrate the product set available to consumers in
wealthier markets is greater for 1.75 L and expensive products though the difference is small and
consumers in poor neighborhoods clearly have access to a large set of these products.
The fact that most stores carry most popular products and can provide access to all products
in the catalog easily, together with the absence of price differences across stores, supports an
important assumption underlying our demand model: Differences in product availability do not
drive customers’ store choices to a significant degree and as a result, consumers visit the store

Notes: A product is considered in the product set of a geographic market if it is ever sold during 2003-2004. Numbers reflect
the average number of products in each category (e.g., 1.75 L products) carried by stores in the relevant income group.

closest to them. In making this assumption, which allows us to focus on the consumer’s choice
between different liquor products available at the chosen store, we follow previous studies using
scanner data such as Chintagunta et al. (2003).33
To define the population served by each store, we calculate the straight-line distance to
each store from each of Pennsylvania’s 10,351 regular block groups and assign consumers to the
closest open store for each pricing period. In instances where the PLCB operates more than one
store within a ZIP code, we aggregate sales across stores to the ZIP code level; there are 114
such ZIP codes out of a total of 1,775. Note that these instances include both store relocations,
where a store moved from one location in a ZIP code to another during 2003, but the data contain
separate records for the store in the two locations, and instances where the PLCB operates two
stores simultaneously within a ZIP code.34 We consider the resulting block group zones as separate
markets.
We derive consumer demographics for the stores’ market areas by calculating the total
population and population-weighted average demographics. We obtained detailed information on
each block group’s discrete income distribution by racial identity of the head of household, with
household income divided into one of 16 categories. We aggregate across racial groups and across
block groups in a store’s market area to derive the discrete income distribution separately for
white and non-white households. We construct two income measures. First, we calculate the
share of high-income households by minority status, defined as households with incomes above
$50,000. Second, we fit continuous market-specific distributions to the discrete distributions of
income conditional on minority status. We employ generalized beta distributions of the second kind
33

Near the state’s borders, the PLCB runs seven outlet stores that sell products, such as multi-packs, not available in
regular stores to reduce the so-called ‘border bleed’ of consumers’ shopping in lower-priced neighboring states. The
addition of these stores to the sample has little qualitative or quantitative effects on the results. See Appendix D

34

We drop wholesale stores, administrative locations, and stores without valid address information, for a total of 13
stores.

to fit the empirical income distributions. McDonald (1984) highlights that the beta distribution
provides a good fit to empirical income data relative to other parametric distributions. Similarly,
used a generalized beta distribution to estimate the continuous market-specific age distribution
though due to data census limitations could not condition this on race or income.
We also obtained information on educational attainment by minority status and aggregated
across several categories of educational attainment to derive the share of the population above the
age of 25 with at least some college education, by minority status and market.
Our price instruments come from two sources. First, the data on retail prices in other liquor
control states consists of monthly product-level shelf prices by liquor control state. We assign a
month to our Pennsylvania pricing periods to facilitate a match between the two data sets. Second,
we attained historical commodity prices for corn and sugar from Quandl, a data aggregator. The
prices are the monthly price of a “continuous contract” for each commodity where a “continuous
contract” is defined as a hypothetical chained composite of a variety of futures contracts and is
intended to represent a the spot market price of the given commodity. We also attained prices for
rice, sorghum, wheat, barley, oats, and glass (as a cost input for bottle size) but found these input
costs provided little additional explanatory power.

C Estimation Procedure
In this Appendix, we lay out the three-stage estimation procedure we adopt to estimate contributions to the consumer’s mean utility from a given product, δjlt , and individual-specific contributions
to utility, µijlt . We discuss each stage in turn, highlighting the variation in the data that allows us
to identify the relevant parameters in each stage.
C.1 Stage 1: Random Coefficients and Demographic Interactions
In the first of the three estimation stages, we estimate the contributions of unobserved (Σ) and
observed (Π) demographic interactions to deviations from mean utility, µijlt , controlling for location
and product by time fixed effects. We decompose the unobserved product valuations, ξjlt , as follows
ξjlt = ζl1 + ξjt + ∆ξjlt .

(C.1)

In equation (C.1), ζl1 is a market fixed effect that captures systematic variation across
locations in the preference for spirits consumption, relative to beer and wine.35 We control for
systematic variation in preferences for a given product over time via ξjt , to reflect the fact that
across the state, a product’s mean demand varies over the course of the year. The remaining
structural error ∆ξjlt represents deviations in unobserved product valuations within a store from
these mean product-time valuations, controlling for the average taste for spirits in market l.
This decomposition of ξjlt simplifies the mean utility of product j, δjlt in equation (5a), to
2
+ ∆ξjlt ,
δjlt = ζl1 + ζjt

(C.2)

2 comprises the effect of product characteristics
where the product and time specific fixed effect ζjt
(xj β), seasonal buying (Ht γ), price (αprjt ), and ξjt on a product’s mean utility.

Equation (C.2) highlights an advantage to our setting: since price does not vary across
locations l, we are able to control for its mean contribution to utility via product by time fixed
effects, which we then use in a second stage estimation to isolate α.
Given a guess at θA = {Σ, Π}, we solve for the structural error ∆ξjlt (θA ) using the following
algorithm. We first find the mean-utility levels δjlt (Sjlt ; θA ) that set the predicted market share
of each product, sjlt in equation (7), equal to the market share observed in the data, Sjlt .36 To
evaluate the integral in equation (7) we simulate for each market l the purchase probabilities
of 1, 000 randomly drawn heterogeneous consumers who vary in their demographics and income.
We construct the sample of simulated consumers for each market by relying on the empirical
35

This accounts for the fact that the potential market is defined based on the average Pennsylvanian’s consumption
as disaggregated per-capita consumption of alcoholic beverages is not available.

36

We make use of the contraction mapping procedure outlined in Appendix I of BLP , imposing a tolerance level for
the contraction mapping of 1e-14 as advised by Dubé, Fox and Su (2012, §4.2) to ensure convergence to consistent
stable estimates.

distributions of the demographic attributes considered above – whether a consumer is young, nonwhite, college educated, and their income level – incorporating correlations between demographic
attributes where possible. Conditional on a realization of a consumer’s minority status, we take
random draws from the corresponding income and educational attainment distributions and assign
the consumer to an age bin based on the unconditional distribution of age above 21 years in the
relevant location. See Appendix A for further details. Since the ambient population of stores
changes with store openings and closings over the course of the year, the simulated set of agents
changes in each pricing period. Lastly, we account for the unobserved preferences via Halton draws.
Given mean utility levels that equate predicted and actual market shares, we then follow
Somaini and Wolak (2015) and use a within transformation of δ to remove the store and product2 , leaving only ∆ξ . We follow the earlier literature in using a

where W + is the weighting matrix, representing a consistent estimate of E[Z + ∆ξ∆ξ 0 Z + ].37 To
increase the likelihood of achieving a global minimum, we employed the Knitro Interior/ Direct
algorithm suggested by Dubé et al. (2012) starting from several different initial conditions.
C.2 Stage 2: Mean Utility – Price and Seasonality Coefficients
In the second of the three stages of the estimation procedure, we decompose the mean utility implied
by the estimated first-stage coefficients θ̂A , δjlt (θ̂A ), into the associated location and product by
2 (θ̂ ). We then project ζ 2 onto price and the seasonal indicators,
type fixed effects, ζl1 (θ̂A ) and ζjt

controlling for product fixed effects ζj ,

ζjt
= Ht γ + αpjt + ζj + ξjt .

(C.4)

Equation (C.4) highlights the potential for price endogeneity, to the extent that price
responds to time varying preference variation for a given product that is common across locations,
in the form of, for example, category-specific seasonal variation in consumption. The PLCB pricing
cannot respond to unobserved demand shocks. However, the predictable link between wholesale and
retail prices opens the possibility to spirit prices being endogenous because of the pricing behavior
37

In constructing our optimal weighting matrix, we first assume homoscedastic errors and use W + = [Z + Z + ]−1
to derive initial parameter estimates. Given these estimates, we solve for the structural error ∆ξ and construct
0
E[Z + ∆ξ∆ξ 0 Z + ]−1 as a consistent estimate for W + .

of upstream distillers whose wholesale prices reflect, through their products’ market shares, the
unobserved common tastes for product characteristics of spirits, ξjt . Recall the pricing optimality
conditions in equation (12).
In principle, such endogeneity concerns are mitigated by the fact that distillers need to
request both temporary and permanent changes to their wholesale price a number of months
before the new price takes effect. Prices thus only respond to predictable variation in a product’s
demand over time. At the same time, none of the available product characteristics vary across time,
limiting our ability to flexibly represent such time varying preference heterogeneity at the level
of the product. We therefore use instrumental variables techniques to estimate the parameters in
equation (C.4) using the contemporaneous average price of a given product from liquor control states
outside of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions (Alabama, Iowa, Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi,
North Carolina, Oregon, Utah, and Wyoming) as an instrument for price denoted as ZB . Our
identifying assumption is that cost shocks are national (since products are often produced in a
single facility) but demand shocks are at most regional, perhaps due to differences in demographics
or climate.38 We add to this instrument changes in input prices, sugar and corn, interacted with
spirit-type dummies to account for exogenous cost shifts across spirit types. For instance, a major
input for rums is sugar while corn is an input to gins, vodkas, and whiskeys. We found that
contemporaneous futures prices worked best while including price-type interactions for barley, glass,
oats, rice, rye, sorghum, and wheat did not improve our estimates. Collapsing the second stage
parameters into vector θB , this implies the following parameter estimates

where X̂B = ZB (ZB

variation in prices over time, benefiting from the fact that distillers do not change the wholesale
prices pw for all products simultaneously.

C.3 Stage 3: Mean Utility – Product Characteristics Coefficients
In the third and final estimation stage, we recover product fixed effects ζj from equation (C.5) and
project them onto observable product characteristics xj , resulting in
θ̂C = (x0 x)−1 x0 ζ .

(C.6)

where mean preferences for these product characteristics are identified by variation in market shares
of spirits of differing characteristics, e.g., proof or spirit type.

38

For example, whiskey consumption, more so than the consumption of other spirits, peaks during the colder fall and
winter months. Whiskey consumption also varies significantly across demographic groups; for example, African
American households consume larger amounts of whiskey than other racial groups relative to their baseline levels
of spirit consumption.

D Robustness
In this Appendix, we present the results of several alternative demand specifications.
In Table D.1 we demonstrate the robustness of our demand results to alternative samples
using a simple OLS multinomial logit demand system. For each model, we regress the logged ratio
of product to outside share on product-period and store fixed effects, including interactions between
mean demographics and product characteristics (e.g., % minority-X-rum dummy). In Column (i)
we presents results using the sample in the main text. This model generates product elasticities
that are similar to our preferred mixed-logit model while the elasticity for spirits as a category is
more elastic reflecting the IIA problem of logit demand systems (see BLP ). In Columns (ii)-(iv) we
vary the number of markets to show that including markets with premium (i.e., large stores) and
border stores (i.e., stores located within five miles of the PA border) as well as the holiday period
has little effect on our estimated price coefficient and elasticities. This indicates that restricting
the sample has little effect on our results.

Notes: The dependent variable for all models is the estimated product-period fixed effect from a firststage regression of log(Sjmt ) − log(S0mt ) onto product-period fixed effects and demographic-product
interactions. Robust standard errors in parentheses. “% Inelastic” is the percentage of products with
inelastic demand. “Spirits” is the price elasticity of total PLCB off-premise (i.e., sold in a state-run
store) spirit sales. “Premium Stores” are a PLCB designation. These stores typically carry greater
number of products. “Border Stores” are stores located within five miles of the Pennsylvania border.

In Table D.2, we show that our estimation approach based on disaggregated data provides
superior identification. In Model (i) we deviate from our multi-step approach and estimate the
model in a single step, regressing the logged ratio of product share to outside share on price,
brand fixed effects, bottle size fixed effects, pricing period fixed effects, market fixed effects, and
mean demographic interactions, where brand refers to all bottle sizes of a particular “brand name”,
e.g., “Absolut Vodka”. Demand becomes steeper relative to the Model (i) in Table D.1 when
following this alternative approach leading to less elastic demand. We see even steeper effects when
aggregating product demand across the state (Models iii and iv).

– ix –

Interestingly, we see that not conducting the estimation via the steps outlined in the text
leads to price elasticity estimates found by Leung and Phelps (1993) as well as other studies. Less
elastic product demands increase estimated dollar markups for upstream firms, ultimately driving
down estimated upstream marginal costs. Miravete et al., 2017 show using similar data that spirit
category elasticities presented in the health literature (e.g., Leung and Phelps, 1993) imply negative
marginal costs for these upstream firms. Table D.2 therefore suggests that such studies may suffer
from an aggregation bias that leads to less elastic estimated demand.

Notes: The dependent variable for models (i)-(ii) is log(Sjmt )−log(S0mt ) while it is log(Sjt )−log(S0t )
for models (iii)-(iv). Robust standard errors in parentheses. “% Inelastic” is the percentage of products
with inelastic demand. “Spirits” is the price elasticity of total PLCB off-premise (i.e., sold in a
state-run store) spirit sales.

In Model (ii) we replace the product fixed effects with observable characteristics (e.g.,
dummies for spirit type, imported). Demand becomes even steeper and demand becomes much more
inelastic due the coarseness of our observable characteristics. For example, two brands of imported
rum could have different unobservable quality to consumers thereby leading different product shares
and firms choosing to charge different prices but in this specification, the estimation wrongly
correlates differences in price with the differences in shares (quantity sold). In Models (iii)-(iv)
we aggregate consumption to the state-level requiring us to drop the demographic interactions but
otherwise using the same controls as Models (ii)-(iii). Again, we see the inclusion of brand fixed
effects is important to absorbing differences in unobservable (to the econometrician) characteristics
across brands. We further see that aggregation drives the elasticity of off-premise spirits to become
more inelastic, well within the set of estimates included in Leung and Phelps (1993).
As discussed in Section C.2, we use the contemporaneous average price in distant control
states as an instrument for price in the second step. In Table D.3, we consider the sensitivity of our
results to the particular instrumentation strategy. We compare the estimated price coefficient from
alternative two-stage least squares regression models of the estimated first stage product-period
fixed effects underlying the estimates in Table 7 projected onto price, seasonal dummies, and
product fixed effects.

–x–

Relative to IV 1, our preferred specification, the estimated price coefficients are stable across
alternative instruments, and, as expected, entail larger price responses than an uninstrumented
OLS specification. Each estimated price coefficient is significant at the 95% level and the sets
of IV s generate significant F-statistics for all specifications. This suggests that, as expected, our
time-invariant observable characteristics are unable to fully capture the variation in a product’s
preferences that distillers base their pricing decisions on.

Notes: In the top panel we regress compensating variation divided by total liquor expenditure in
market l on market characteristics. A negative value for mean compensating variation indicates the
average consumer in market l is better off under the alternative policy considered. Robust standard
errors reported in between parentheses. All regressions include a constant (not reported). age is
log(average age) in the location. education, income, and minority are defined in Table 5. In the
bottom panel we compare current policy to each alternative policy. For example, retail prices are on
average 0.91% lower under th3 30% single markup than they would be under product-specific markups
(i.e., the “Product” column). “Number of Markups” refers to the number of markups chosen by the
PLCB . A policy is “Constrained” when the PLCB chooses its markup policy subject to an aggregate
budget constraint. “Product” and “Ramsey” policies are described in the text. “Type” corresponds
to the equilibrium when the PLCB chooses markups for bottle size (3) and spirit type (6) to maximize
tax revenue. “Ramsey” corresponds to the equilibrium when the PLCB chooses product markups to
maximize consumer surplus subject to generating at least as much tax revenue as under the single
pricing rule. “Pigou’ corresponds to the Ramsey equilibrium with an ethanol-adjusted government
budget constraint.
