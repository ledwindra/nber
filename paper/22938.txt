Improving the Measurement of Earnings Dynamics

ABSTRACT
The stochastic process for earnings is the key element of incomplete markets models in modern
quantitative macroeconomics. We show that a simple modification of the canonical process used
in the literature leads to a dramatic improvement in the measurement of earnings dynamics in
administrative and survey data alike. Empirically, earnings at the start or end of earnings spells
are lower and more volatile than the observations in the interior of earnings histories, reflecting
the effects of working less than the full year as well as deviations of wages due to e.g. tenure
effects. Ignoring these properties of earnings, as is standard in the literature, leads to a substantial
mismeasurement of the variances of permanent and transitory shocks and induces the large and
widely documented divergence in the estimates of these variances based on fitting the earnings
moments in levels or growth rates. Accounting for these effects enables more accurate analysis
using quantitative models with permanent and transitory earnings risk, and improves empirical
estimates of consumption insurance against permanent earnings shocks.

Introduction

The central element of many models in modern quantitative macroeconomics with heterogeneous agents is either an exogenously specified or an endogenously determined stochastic
process for individual earnings. For example, in the models with incomplete insurance markets,
the properties of the earnings process serve as key determinants of the evolution of consumption, assets, and other economic choices over the life cycle and across individuals.1 Following
the seminal contribution by Friedman (1957), modern consumption theory recognizes that
consumption should respond more to the longer-lasting or permanent than to transitory innovations in earnings. This explains the keen interest in the literature in measuring the variances
of these components using the variants of the permanent/transitory earnings decomposition2
written, in its basic form, as:
yit = αi + pit + τit
pit = φp pit−1 + ξit

(1)

τit = θ(L)it ,
where log-earnings yit of individual i at time t consists of the permanent component, pit , and
the transitory component, τit . If φp is close to 1, the shocks ξit are highly persistent (and are
truly permanent if φp is 1), and if θ(L) = 1 (where θ(L) is a moving average polynomial in
the lag operator L), the shocks it are completely transitory.
In addition to determining equilibrium consumption and wealth distributions, the variance
and persistence of the shocks ξit and it have important implications for policy design. For
example, they are key to determining the optimal design of the bankruptcy code in Livshits,
MacGee, and Tertilt (2007), they govern the impact of the welfare system on household savings in Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes (1995), stimulus effects of fiscal policy in Heathcote
(2005) and Hagedorn, Manovskii, and Mitman (2018), the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in Kaplan, Moll, and Violante (2018) and Hagedorn, Luo, Manovskii, and Mitman
(2018) as well as the optimal design of the tax system in Banks and Diamond (2010) and
Farhi and Werning (2012). Moreover, there is great interest in understanding whether the
dramatic increase in earnings dispersion over the last few decades in the U.S. is due to the
increase in the variances of persistent or transitory shocks (e.g., Gottschalk and Moffitt, 1994).
This understanding is relevant for determining why consumption inequality did not increase
nearly as much (e.g., Krueger and Perri, 2006; Blundell, Pistaferri, and Preston, 2008; Heathcote, Storesletten, and Violante, 2010; Attanasio, Hurst, and Pistaferri, 2012). Knowing the

This decomposition was pioneered by Friedman and Kuznets (1954) and found to have empirical support
by MaCurdy (1982), Abowd and Card (1989), and Meghir and Pistaferri (2004), among others. A prominent
alternative, e.g., Guvenen (2009), allows for less persistent shocks but individual-specific trends in earnings.

stochastic nature of earnings is also essential for the design of active labor market policies.
For example, Meghir and Pistaferri (2011) suggest that income maintenance policies might be
an appropriate response to changes in inequality driven by transitory shocks, while training
programs are potentially more relevant to counteracting the effects of permanent shocks.
Unfortunately, despite their manifest importance, there is no consensus in the literature
on the sizes of the shocks it and ξit . In particular, using the same data, the estimates of
the earnings process in Eq. (1) when targeting the moments of log-earnings in levels are
dramatically different from the estimates obtained when fitting the moments of log-earnings
in differences. Although this discrepancy was first documented using survey-based data, it
remained undiminished when the focus of the literature has shifted to relying more on administrative datasets.3 These datasets are typically orders of magnitude larger than survey-based
ones; free of sampling issues; do not suffer from the typical issues of attrition; are based on
administrative sources, such as tax records which are considered highly reliable and free of
issues of systematic non-response or measurement errors that typically plague survey-based
data. Yet, despite numerous attractive properties, these datasets must also have features that
lead to the large discrepancy in the estimates based on moments in growth rates and in levels.
Such observations led Heathcote, Perri, and Violante (2010) to conclude that the widely
used model of earnings dynamics in Eq. (1) is misspecified. However, the nature of this
potential misspecification is unknown. This challenges our confidence in the conclusions of
the models that incorporate this earnings process. Even if this misspecified process is used as a
model input due to the lack of a better alternative, it is unclear whether it is more appropriate
to parameterize it using the estimates targeting the moments in levels or in differences in the
data. Relatedly, in the literature that endogenizes the earnings process,4 it is unclear whether
the process implied by the model should be compared to the one estimated in the data using
the specification in levels or in differences, given that estimating the reduced-form process (1)
on the model-generated data does not give rise to the observed discrepancy.
In this paper, we uncover an important source of this misspecification. Estimation of the
parameters of the earnings process in the literature is based on fitting the entire set of autocovariance moments for levels or differences of log-earnings. However, even when estimation
is based on the same set of observations in the data, computation of the autocovariance moments in levels and differences is effectively based on different information. To clarify with
an extreme example, consider an individual with a single earnings observation in the sample.
This observation will contribute to the estimated variance of earnings in levels, but it will not
contribute to any moment in differences. More generally, earnings observations adjacent to a
missing one (e.g., observations at the start or at the end of individual’s earnings history) also

contribute differently to moments in levels and differences. If earnings observations surrounding the missing ones were random draws from the rest of earnings histories, this would not
matter. However, in the data these observations are much lower than the typical ones and
more volatile. We will show formally that this raises the variance of transitory shocks when
estimation relies on the moments in levels and the variance of permanent shocks recovered by
estimation based on the moments in differences.
In the first set of quantitative experiments in the paper we assess the magnitude of these
effects using large administrative datasets from Denmark and Germany. The Danish data
contain complete earnings histories of each resident of Denmark from 1981 through 2006. The
German data are a 2% random sample of social security numbers. For these individuals, the
complete earnings history from 1975 through 2008 is available. These samples are sufficiently
large to allow analysis at the level of particular age cohorts, making it possible to focus
on a parsimonious earnings model in (1), sidestepping the issue of modeling cohort effects.
Moreover, the large size of the data enables reliable estimation when replicating the design of
samples typically used in the literature. Specifically, we consider a balanced sample spanning
25 (26) years in German (Danish) data, a sample with 9 or more consecutive observations, as
in e.g., Browning, Ejrnæs, and Alvarez (2010) and Meghir and Pistaferri (2004), and a sample
with 20 or more not necessarily consecutive observations as in e.g., Guvenen (2009). Our
smallest Danish sample is comprised of about 67,000 individuals and 1.7 million observations,
while our smallest German sample contains about 10,000 individuals with more than 200,000
observations.
Using the unbalanced samples in both datasets, we find, consistent with the literature, a
substantially higher estimated variance of permanent (transitory) shocks targeting the moments of earnings in growth rates (levels). In contrast, we find that the discrepancy is nearly
absent in balanced samples drawn from the two datasets. To highlight the differences between
the earnings trajectories in balanced and unbalanced samples that we argue induce these results, in Figure 1 we plot 20 random (residual) earnings paths for four subsamples in the
German data over 1984-2008 period.5 Panel (a) depicts earnings paths for individuals in the
balanced sample. For the vast majority of these individuals, their first year in the sample
does not coincide with the first year of their earnings history. Similarly, their last year in the
sample mechanically truncates earnings histories, implying that it is not the last year of the
earnings spell of individuals in the sample. Thus, the mean and the variance of earnings in
the first and the last sample years are similar to those in the other years. This stands in sharp
contrast to earnings histories of individuals entering and/or exiting the data in the interior
of the sample window. For example, panel (b) plots earnings paths for individuals leaving
the sample early – in 2002–2004. Panel (c) plots earnings paths for individuals entering the

For this figure, we used data for individuals whose mean residual earnings belong to the 45th to 55th
percentiles of the distribution of the mean individual residual earnings.

sample late – in 1989–1991. Finally, panel (d) plots earnings paths for individuals with an
incomplete spell that starts later than 1984 and ends earlier than 2008. Clearly, the earnings
at the start and/or the end of incomplete earnings spells are considerably lower on average
and substantially more volatile than typical earnings observations. Our theoretical argument
implies that the non-randomness of earnings surrounding missing observations in the unbalanced samples can induce the discrepancy between the estimates in levels and differences in
the data from the unbalanced samples. The quantitative question is how large this effect is.
To provide an answer, we proceed in three steps. First, we quantify the contribution of
the low mean and high variance of earnings surrounding missing observations in the unbalanced samples to the subset of theoretical autocovariance moments on which the identification
argument in levels and differences is based, and confirm that they induce the observed discrepancy in the estimates. Second, using unbalanced samples, we remove a few observations
at the start and end of the incomplete earnings histories, as well as observations surrounding
missing records. We find that estimating the earnings process in levels and in differences
4

on the remaining data yields virtually identical estimates of the variances of permanent and
transitory shocks. Third, we simulate artificial data based on these estimates of the earnings
process while replicating the structure of the unbalanced samples (by design of this experiment, first and last observations as well as those surrounding missing observations are not
systematically different from observations in the rest of the earnings histories). We find no
discrepancy of the estimates in levels and differences in these artificial data. We then draw
an additional transitory shock at the start and end of the earnings history and surrounding
missing observations to replicate the mean and the variance of earnings in those periods in
the data. We find that in this case, the estimates of the variance of permanent and transitory
shocks are very different when moments in levels and differences are used, but are very close
to those in the data from the corresponding unbalanced samples.
The results of these experiments lead us to conclude that the discrepancy in the estimates
of the earnings process (1) in growth rates and levels is indeed driven by its misspecification.
The nature of the misspecification is surprisingly simple. It is driven by the high variance and
the lower mean of the observations surrounding missing records. We show that an extended
earnings process that includes these elements can be estimated in the data. Estimation of
such an extended process results in similar parameters regardless of whether the moments in
levels or differences are used.
While the focus of this paper is on the administrative data on individual earnings, the
insights apply more broadly. In the appendix to this paper we show that both individual
earnings and hourly wage observations surrounding the missing ones in survey data from the
Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) exhibit a lower mean and higher variance than
the typical observations, and that accounting for the properties of these observations helps
reconcile the dramatically different estimates of the variances of permanent and transitory
shocks when targeting the moments in levels or differences. Hryshko and Manovskii (2018)
show that the same findings also hold for total household earnings and net family incomes
in the PSID. They also show that not taking these features of the data into account when
estimating the stochastic properties of family earnings and income induces a large bias on the
estimated degree of consumption insurance achieved through household saving and borrowing
as well as on the estimated insurance role of the public tax and transfer system.
Although the mechanism described in this paper is powerful in reconciling the estimates of
the earnings process in growth rates and levels, it is not the only mechanism that can generate
such discrepancy. For example, Hryshko and Manovskii (2017) show that the discrepancy can
also be induced if one restricts the heterogeneity of the persistence of the permanent component of income relative to its extent in the data. Importantly, this type of misspecification
cannot generate the difference between the theoretical moments that we use to establish identification in levels and differences in this paper, because they are identically affected by any
such misspecification. These theoretical identifying moments can only differ if the underlying
5

autocovariance moments on which they are based disagree, and we show that this is indeed
the consequence of the low mean and high variance of observations at the start and end of
earnings spells. We find that this accounts for virtually all discrepancy of the estimates in
growth rates and levels in the data considered in this paper.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss identification of
the permanent-transitory decomposition of earnings, and derive theoretically the biases in the
estimated variances of permanent and transitory shocks when using the moments in levels and
differences constructed from an unbalanced panel. In Section 3, we describe the administrative
Danish and German data and the estimation procedure. In the same section, we present
basic estimation results and document that earnings are typically lower and more volatile in
the periods surrounding missing observations. In Section 4, we show that this property of
earnings quantitatively accounts for the difference in estimates of earnings processes in levels
and differences in administrative data. In the Appendix, we confirm that our findings based on
administrative data also apply to survey data on earnings and wages from the PSID. Section
5 concludes.

Sources of the Differences in Estimates Targeting Earnings Growth Rates and Levels

2.1

Identifying Moments

In the literature, estimation of the parameters of the earnings process typically relies on the
minimum-distance method. In particular, estimation based on the moments in levels targets
the entire set of autocovariance moments E[yit yit+j ], where i ∈ [1, N ] denotes individuals in
the sample, t denotes time, and j denotes all leads and lags of earnings observed in the data.
In differences, estimation targets the full set of autocovariance moments E[∆yit ∆yit+j ], where
∆ is the difference operator between two consecutive observations, ∆yit+j ≡ yit+j − yit+j−1 .
Although all available autocovariance moments are used in estimation, identification is
usually established using only a subset of autocovariance moments; see, e.g., Meghir and
Pistaferri (2004), Blundell, Pistaferri, and Preston (2008), and Heathcote, Storesletten, and
Violante (2014). For example, consider the earnings process that consists of a random walk
and an i.i.d. transitory shock, which corresponds to setting θ(L) and φp to 1 in Eq. (1).
This process was considered by Heathcote, Perri, and Violante (2010), who, assuming that
transitory and permanent shocks are not correlated with each other and with initial conditions,
proposed the following moments to identify the variances of permanent and transitory shocks

(D2)

Note that (D1) and (D2) represent linear combinations of autocovariance moments for
earnings growth rates. For clarity, we will refer to individual autocovariance moments as simply “moments,” and to a linear combination of autocovariance moments used for identification
such as (D1) and (D2) as “identifying moments.”
Expanding (D1) and (D2), we obtain the identifying moments for the variances of permanent and transitory shocks, based on autocovariance moments in levels, at time t:
Levels:

= E[yit yit+1 ] − E[yit+1 yit−1 ] − E[yit yit−2 ] + E[yit−1 yit−2 ],

(L1)

σ,t
= E[yit yit ] − E[yit yit+1 ] − E[yit−1 yit ] + E[yit−1 yit+1 ].

(L2)

In a sample of individuals whose earnings are nonmissing for the periods t − 2 through
t + 1, the identifying moments (D1)-(D2) and (L1)-(L2) are expected to deliver identical
estimates of the variance of permanent and transitory shocks at time t, since they are based on
exactly the same earnings information. Moreover, as the moments (L1)-(L2) simply represent
an expansion of the moments (D1)-(D2), they will be identically affected by other potential
misspecifications of the earnings process. This allows us to isolate and measure the importance
of the high variance and low mean of the observations at the start and end of contiguous
earnings spells, which, as we show below, contribute differently to the autocovariance moments
on which (D1)-(D2) and (L1)-(L2) are based.6
For example, the presence of omitted idiosyncratic trends in earnings will not induce a
wedge between the estimated variances of permanent shocks using the moments (L1) and (D1)
(or transitory shocks using the moments (L2) and (D2)). Specifically, suppose individuals
6

Identifying moments in levels can be constructed using fewer autocovariance moments, such as

= E[yit yit+1 ] − E[yit yit−1 ],

(L1-Short)

(L2-Short)

= E[yit yit ] − E[yit yit+1 ].

These moments are analogous to those in Heathcote, Perri, and Violante (2010) if one relies on the annual data,
instead of biennial data used in their paper, for identification of the variances. These identifying moments
in levels do not, however, use the same information as the identifying moments (D1)-(D2) in differences. For
example, the information on earnings in t − 2 is used in (D1) but not in (L1-Short). Moreover, Hryshko and
Manovskii (2017) show that a misspecification of the persistence of the permanent component drives a wedge
between the estimates based on identifying moments (D1)-(D2) and (L1-Short)-(L2-Short), but not between
identifying moments (D1)-(D2) and (L1)-(L2).

differ in growth rates such that the earnings process is yit = αi + βi hit + pit + it , where
βi ∼ iid(0, σβ2 ) and hit counts years of (potential) work experience. In this case (L1) and (D1)
will both deliver 3σβ2 + σξ2t .7 It follows that both (L1) and (D1) will recover an upward-biased
estimate of the variance of the permanent shock but the bias will be the same in levels and
differences. Relatedly, the typical estimates of σξ2 using (D1) imply a much steeper profile of
earnings inequality over the life cycle (and time) than that observed in the data. The fit to
this profile might be improved if one allows for a negative cross-sectional correlation between
initial conditions, αi , and permanent shocks, ξit . Omitting such correlation, however, does
not induce a difference in the estimated moments (L1) and (D1). For example, suppose that
the correlation is implied by ξit = καi + ηit , where ηit is orthogonal to αi and it . In this case,
(D1) and (L1) will recover identical upward-biased estimate 3κ2 σα2 + σξ2t , but the bias will once
again be the same in levels and differences.
Importantly, each autocovariance moment is measured as the average across all available
observations that contribute to it. This implies that, although the identifying moments (D1)(D2) and (L1)-(L2) are based on the same earnings data, the autocovariance moments used
in estimating (D1)-(D2) and (L1)-(L2) are computed using different sets of observations. Returning to the extreme example used in the Introduction, consider an individual who appears
in the sample only once, in period t. This individual will contribute to the autocovariance moment E[yit yit ], and thus his only earnings observation will affect the identifying moment (L2)
but it will not contribute to any autocovariance moment used to construct the corresponding
identifying moment in differences (D2). If earnings of individuals who appear in the sample
only once are systematically different, this will induce the difference between identifying moments (L2) and (D2) and lead to different estimates of the variance of transitory shocks using
the moments in levels and differences.
Similarly, we will now show that earnings observations at the time individuals enter or
exit the sample contribute differently to the autocovariance moments on which the identifying
moments (D1)-(D2) and (L1)-(L2) are based. Moreover, our empirical analysis will reveal
that these earnings observations are systematically different (they are typically lower and
substantially more volatile). In the rest of this section we formally show that this induces
systematic differences in estimated variances of permanent and transitory shocks using the
moments in growth rates and levels. In subsequent sections, we quantify the magnitude of the
induced difference.
7

This derivation assumes that corr(αi , βi ) = 0 but a similar expression obtains if this assumption is relaxed.

2.2

The Effects of Irregular Observations next to the Missing Ones
in Various Samples

We will consider three types of samples. Suppose a dataset containing panel data on individual
earnings starts in period t0 and ends in period T . We refer to the sample as balanced if all
individuals in the sample have T − t0 + 1 valid earnings observations. While not part of the
formal definition, it is convenient to think that earnings spells of individuals in the balanced
samples start before t0 and end after T . In other words, the boundaries of the balanced sample
mechanically truncate continuous earnings spells in progress. We refer to samples that include
only uninterrupted earnings spells (i.e., no gaps) but with duration of less than T − t0 + 1 for
at least some individuals as consecutive unbalanced samples. Finally, we refer to unbalanced
samples that also include individual earnings spells interrupted by missing observations in any
period t ∈ (t0 , T ) as non-consecutive unbalanced samples.
2.2.1

Consecutive unbalanced samples

The nature of these samples is such that at least some individuals are observed starting or
ending their earnings spells inside the sample window.
As mentioned above and documented below, earnings have a lower mean and are highly
volatile in the first and last periods of an incomplete earnings history. Consider modeling
this through an additional transitory ν-shock that occurs only in the first and last year of an
individual’s earnings history, that is
yit = αi + pit + it + νit ,
where νit has mean µν (taking a negative value) and variance σν2 , and is uncorrelated with
permanent and transitory shocks and initial conditions. We will now show that ignoring νit
and estimating the process (1) instead leads to an upward bias in the estimated variance of
permanent shocks using the moments in differences and in the estimated variance of transitory
shocks using the moments in levels.
For simplicity, assume there is a set of individuals first entering the sample at time t, in
the interior of the sample period [t0 , T ], whereas the remaining individuals are continuously
observed throughout the sample. Individuals first appearing at time t will contribute to
estimation of the autocovariance moments E[yit yit ] and E[yit yit+1 ] in the identifying moment
(L2). The estimated moment E[yit yit+1 ] will be no different for such individuals than for the
rest of the sample, and will equal σα2 + var(pit ). The other moments in (L2), E[yit−1 yit ] and
E[yit−1 yit+1 ], will both equal σα2 + var(pit−1 ). The autocovariance moment E[yit yit ] estimated
2
on the full sample, however, will equal σα2 + var(pit ) + σ,t
+ st (µ2ν + σν2 ), where st is the share
of individuals, at time t, whose (incomplete) spells start at time t in the total number of
9

individuals at time t with nonmissing earnings. The identifying moment (L2), therefore, will
2
recover an estimate of the variance of transitory shocks equal to σ,t
+ st (µ2ν + σν2 ), with an
upward bias of st (µ2ν + σν2 ).
The variance of permanent shocks at time t + 1, estimated using the identifying moment
(D1), will also be biased upward. Individuals first appearing at t will contribute to estimation of the autocovariance moments E[∆yit+1 ∆yit+1 ] and E[∆yit+1 ∆yit+2 ] in the identifying
moment (D1). For such individuals, the autocovariance moment E[∆yit+1 ∆yit+2 ] will be no
different from the rest of the sample and will equal −σ2t+1 , while the autocovariance moment
E[∆yit+1 ∆yit+1 ] will equal σξ2t+1 + st,t+1 (µ2ν + σν2 ) + σ2t + σ2t+1 , where st,t+1 is the share of individuals who start (incomplete) earnings spells at time t, with nonmissing earnings at times
t and t + 1, in the number of individuals with nonmissing earnings both at t and t + 1. Since
the autocovariance moment E[∆yit+1 ∆yit ] will be estimated using information for those individuals whose earnings are nonmissing in periods t − 1 through t + 1 and will equal −σ2t , the
identifying moment (D1) for time t + 1 will recover an estimate of the permanent shock equal
to σξ2t+1 + st,t+1 (µ2ν + σν2 ), with an upward bias of st,t+1 (µ2ν + σν2 ).
Note that if the ν-shock first appears, say, at time t + 1, i.e. in the interior of an earnings
spell for individuals first entering into the sample at time t, it will simply elevate, by the same
magnitude, the estimated variance of transitory shocks in levels and differences at time t + 1,
with no differential effect on the identifying moments (L2) and (D1).
Summing up, incomplete earnings spells first appearing in the sample at t will bias upward
the estimated variance of transitory shocks at time t when targeting the moments in levels,
and will bias upward the estimated variance of permanent shocks at time t + 1 when targeting
the moments in differences. They have no effect, at any point in time, on the estimated
magnitude of the identifying moments (L1) and (D2).
The same logic extends to the incomplete earnings spells ending at time t, which is different
from the last potential sample year T – the presence of such spells will produce upward-biased
estimates of permanent variances in differences at t (since these individuals will contribute
to estimation of the moment E[∆yit ∆yit ] that is part of the identifying moment D1) and of
transitory variances in levels at t.
2.2.2

Non-consecutive unbalanced samples

We now consider the consequences of missing earnings in the interior points of the earnings
history. We assume that individual earnings are realizations of the earnings process (1), with
some observations missing in any period t ∈ (t0 , T ). We will show below that such periods are
often associated in the data with low mean and high variance of earnings in periods t − 1 and
t + 1. We model this by introducing additional transitory ν-shocks with a negative mean µν at
the time before and after earnings are missing (νit−1 and νit+1 , respectively) that are assumed

10

to be uncorrelated with fixed effects, permanent and transitory shocks, and uncorrelated with
each other:8
yit−1 = αi + pit−1 + it−1 + νit−1 ,
yit missing,
yit+1 = αi + pit+1 + it+1 + νit+1 .
Assume there is a set of individuals whose earnings are missing at time t, which is interior
to the sample period [t0 , T ], while the rest of individuals have continuously observed earnings
throughout the whole sample period.
In this case, the variance of transitory shocks at times t − 1 and t + 1 using the moments
in levels will be biased upward as the autocovariance moments E[yit−1 yit−1 ] and E[yit+1 yit+1 ]
in the identifying moment (L2) are amplified by the variation of the ν-shocks. Similarly, the
variance of permanent shocks at times t − 1 and t + 2 using the moments in differences will
be biased upward as the autocovariance moments E[∆yit−1 ∆yit−1 ] and E[∆yit+2 ∆yit+2 ] in the
identifying moment (D1) are amplified by the variation of the ν-shocks. Since the ν-shocks
are assumed to be uncorrelated, the identifying moments (L1) and (D2) will not be affected.
Thus, incomplete earnings spells with missing earnings at t, in the interior of the sample
period, will bias upward the estimated variance of transitory shocks at times t − 1 and t + 1
when targeting the moments in levels, and will bias upward the variance of permanent shocks
at times t − 1 and t + 2 when targeting the moments in differences.

Although the biases for the variance of transitory shocks in levels will be exactly the same
as in the random-walk case, the biases for the variance of permanent shocks recovered using

the bias will remain large, since φp is typically estimated at high values in various datasets.
2.3.2

Serially correlated transitory component and/or ν-shocks

The transitory component is often estimated to have some persistence. Assume that the
transitory component is modeled as τit+1 = it+1 + θτ it , and that the ν-shock component
is modeled as χit = νit , which is nonzero in the beginning and/or end of an incomplete
earnings spell, and before/after a missing earnings record, and that χit+1 = θχ νit – both will
be consistent with the autocovariance function for earnings growth rates truncating at the
second order, as is often found in the empirical applications.10 In this case, the moments
(L1)–(D2) no longer identify the variances of permanent and transitory shocks. In growth
rates, the identifying moment for the variance of permanent shocks should be modified to
2
σξ,t
= E[∆yit ∆yit+2 ] + E[∆yit ∆yit+1 ] + E[∆yit ∆yit ] + E[∆yit ∆yit−1 ] + E[∆yit ∆yit−2 ].

(D1-b)

The variance of permanent shocks at time t + 1, estimated using (D1-b), will be biased
upward by the magnitude st,t+1 (1 − θχ )2 (µ2ν + σν2 ) for a sample with consecutive earnings spells
where a fraction of individuals enter the sample at time t > t0 , for the first time. Note that
the bias will remain large for small positive values of θχ . If, instead, individuals exit the
sample at some time t < T , the bias of the permanent variance using the moments in growth
rates will be unaffected by serial correlation of the ν-shocks since the earnings paths for such
individuals are unobserved past year t; the bias in this case will be the same as in the case
of a serially uncorrelated transitory component. The same logic extends to the biases in the
non-consecutive samples. The variance of permanent shocks recovered using the moments in
levels will remain unbiased (as can be verified from the identifying moment for permanent
shocks in levels obtained by expanding (D1-b)).
10

This formulation assumes that ν- and -shocks both die out in two periods, with the difference that the
ν-shock process does not renew itself in the next period with a new ν-shock.

12

Under assumption of no measurement error in administrative earnings, θτ can be identified
from the first and second-order autocovariances in earnings growth rates if the transitory
component is serially correlated and there are no ν-shocks; see, e.g., Meghir and Pistaferri
(2004). One can then identify the variance of transitory shocks dividing (L2) and (D2) by
(1 − θτ )2 . If the ν-shock is serially correlated, however, θτ will be recovered with a bias
using the standard moment. We will label this estimate as θ̃τ . Assuming that the variance of
transitory shocks does not change much between adjacent periods, for the data with incomplete
consecutive spells that start at t, an estimate of the variance of transitory shocks relying on


(L2) will yield (1 − θ̃τ )−2 (1 − θτ )2 σ2t + s(1 − θχ )(µ2ν + σν2 ) , whereas an estimate relying on


(D2) will yield an estimate (1 − θ̃τ )−2 (1 − θτ )2 σ2t − sθχ (1 − θχ )(µ2ν + σν2 ) for t + 1.11 Clearly,
an estimate of the variance of transitory shocks in levels is larger than an estimate using growth
rates given θχ is nonnegative. This logic extends to other examples of incomplete earnings
spells in consecutive and non-consecutive panels – the estimated variance of transitory shocks
using the moments in levels will be higher than the estimated variance of transitory shocks
using the moments in growth rates.

2.4

Summary

The analysis above yields three major implications if ν-shocks are present in the data. First,
estimating the abbreviated earnings process in (1), one may expect to recover without any
biases the variance of transitory shocks using the moments in growth rates if the ν-shock is
not serially correlated, and the variance of permanent shocks using the moments in levels.
Second, the identifying moments in levels tend to produce upward-biased estimates of the
variance of transitory shocks, while the identifying moments in differences produce upwardbiased estimates of the variance of permanent shocks. The magnitude of the biases depends
positively on the variance of the ν-shocks and on the difference between their mean from the
mean of the shocks in the rest of earnings histories. Finally, if one’s interest extends beyond
identifying properties of permanent and transitory shocks of the abbreviated earnings process
in (1), the remaining parameters of the comprehensive earnings process can also be estimated
by introducing the moments identifying the mean and variance of ν-shocks.

Data, Estimation Details, and Basic Results

3.1

Data

In this section we describe the administrative data and construction of the samples that we
study. Following the literature, we focus on individuals with a strong attachment to the labor

market characterized by sufficiently high earnings and time spent working.12
3.1.1

Danish data

Several administrative registers provided by Statistics Denmark were used to construct our
samples. The tax register from 1980–2006 provides panel data on total earnings for more than
99.9 percent of Danish residents between the ages of 15 and 70. The register was merged
with the Danish Integrated Database for Labor Market Research (IDA) so that additional
demographic variables such as educational status could be appended. The population consists
of Danish males born in 1951 through 1955. We observe annual earnings over the period of
1980 through 2006. We first remove all individuals who were ever self-employed and drop
records in which an individual was making non-positive labor market earnings. Next, we
drop records for those individuals who have worked less than 10 percent of the year as a
full-time employee; this restriction limits our data to the period 1981–2006, since we cannot
identify full-time employment status for the year 1980.13 Annual earnings in a particular year
include all earned labor income, taken from tax records, for that calendar year. This variable
is considered “high quality” by Statistics Denmark in that it very accurately captures the
earnings of individuals. Earnings are expressed in 1981 monetary units (Danish kroner). We
calculate the maximum number of consecutive periods in which an individual has nonmissing
earnings and use this information to construct two consecutive samples: a sample in which an
individual’s maximum spell is at least nine consecutive periods (102,825 individuals), and a
balanced sample in which the individual’s maximum spell covers the entire 26 periods (67,008
individuals). For the sample with nine or more consecutive observations, periods outside of
the longest spell are discarded. Within the longest spell, an earnings outlier is defined by an
12

The selection rules we adopt are typical of the literature that utilizes survey data as well as administrative
data. For example, Guvenen, Ozcan, and Song (2014) use U.S. administrative data on individual wage and
salary income and make the following sample selection: “For a statistic computed using data for not necessarily
consecutive years t1 , t2 , . . . , tn , an individual observation is included if the following three conditions are
satisfied for all these years: the individual (i) is between the ages of 25 and 60, (ii) has annual wage/salary
earnings that exceed a time-varying minimum threshold, and (iii) is not self-employed (i.e., has self-employment
earnings less than the same minimum threshold). This minimum, denoted Ymin,t , is equal to one-half of the
legal minimum wage times 520 hours... This condition allows us to focus on workers with a reasonably strong
labor market attachment and avoids issues with taking the logarithm of small numbers. It also makes our
results more comparable to the income dynamics literature, where this condition is standard.” Similarly,
DeBacker, Heim, Panousi, Ramnath, and Vidangos (2013) “. . . exclude earnings (or income) observations
below a minimum threshold. . . ” and “. . . take the relevant threshold to be one-fourth of a full-year, full-time
minimum wage.” In line with our selection of consecutive unbalanced samples (with the difference that we
use at least nine consecutive earnings observations), Blundell, Graber, and Mogstad (2015) “. . . restrict the
sample to individuals with at least four subsequent observations with positive market income.”
13
We use the variable “erhverv” from the IDAP table provided by Statistics Denmark. This variable calculates work experience as a full-time employee since 1980 based on individuals’ yearly pension contributions
and is available for all members of the population (with the exception of those individuals who have spent time
abroad, for whom the variable is reset to 0). By taking the first difference of this measure, we can calculate
the percentage of the year during which an individual has worked full-time, which restricts our observation
period to 1981–2006.

14

increase in earnings of more than 500 percent or a fall of more than 80 percent in adjacent
years. Individuals with earnings outliers within their longest spell are dropped. The third
sample we consider consists of individuals who have at least 20 not necessarily consecutive
periods in which they have nonmissing earnings (90,668 individuals). We also drop individuals
from this sample if they have earnings growth outliers. Finally, we drop individuals if their
educational status has changed during the spells considered. Table 1 contains basic statistics
for selected samples.
3.1.2

German data

We use administrative data from the IABS, a 2% random sample of German social security
records for the years 1974–2008. A detailed description of the dataset can be found in Dustmann, Ludsteck, and Schönberg (2009). We use full-time job spells for German males born
in 1951–1955, dropping the spells in East Germany. We also drop annual records when an
individual was in apprenticeship during any part of the year. Individual real earnings are the
sum of earnings from all jobs held within a year expressed in 2005 euros. We set individual
education to the maximum schooling attained during the sample years, and set the number of
days worked to the sum of calendar days on all jobs within a year. As individual earnings are
right-censored at the highest level subject to social security contributions, we impute earnings
exceeding the limit assuming that daily wages in the upper tail follow a Pareto distribution,
the parameters of which differ by year and age group.14 After 1983, earnings include one-time
payments such as bonuses. To make variable definitions consistent throughout, we use only
the data since 1984. We also drop individual records on annual earnings if the combined
duration of job spells within a year is fewer than 35 calendar days, and drop records with very
low daily earnings.15 As in the Danish data, we construct three samples – balanced, with nine
or more consecutive, and with 20 or more not necessarily consecutive earnings observations
– and, as with the Danish samples, drop individuals who have earnings growth outliers. The
respective samples contain 9,452, 18,130, and 13,635 individuals with 236,300, 379,080, and
330,748 observations, respectively. Table 2 provides some descriptive details of the samples.
14

We consider the following eight age groups: those younger than 25, six five-year age groups (25–29, 30–34,
35–39, 40–44, 45–49, and 50–54), and those older than 54. We use a “fixed effects” imputation, keeping a
uniform draw for each individual affected by the right-censoring limit fixed when creating a Pareto variate
in different years. We also experimented with imputation based on the assumption that truncated log-wage
distribution is normal, and a simpler imputation when daily wage is multiplied by the factor 1.2 if it hits
the upper censoring limit. These three imputation methods have been used in Dustmann, Ludsteck, and
Schönberg (2009). Our conclusions below are robust with respect to the choice of the imputation method
as well as with respect to limiting the sample to individuals whose earnings histories are not affected by the
censoring.
15
The highest marginal part-time income threshold during the sample period was 13.15 euros a day (set for
the first time in 2003), and we drop the records with daily earnings below 14 euros in 2003 prices in any year.

3.2

Estimation Details

As is standard in the literature, we estimate the earnings process in Eq. (1) using the method
of minimum distance, fitting the data autocovariance function of log-earnings in levels or first
differences to the autocovariance function implied by the model.16 We allow for an MA(1)
transitory component and an unrestricted estimation of the persistence of the permanent
component, φp .17 Thus, we estimate five parameters in total – the persistence and the variance
of permanent shocks, φp and σξ2 ; the persistence and the variance of transitory shocks, θ
and σ2 ; and the variance of individual fixed effects, σα2 . We assume that individuals start
accumulating permanent and transitory shocks at the age of 25 so that part of the estimated
variance of fixed effects captures the accumulated permanent and transitory components prior
to that age. We also assume that permanent and transitory shocks are not correlated with
each other and with fixed effects. We remove predictable variation in earnings by estimating
cross-sectional regressions of log earnings on educational dummies, a third polynomial in age,
and the interactions of the age polynomial with the educational dummies. Our measure of
idiosyncratic earnings, consistent with the literature, is the residual from those regressions.
Since our samples are large, we estimate the model using the optimal weighting matrix which
is an inverse of the variance-covariance matrix of the data moments.

Basic Results
Samples with nine or more consecutive observations

Columns (1)–(4) in Table 3 contain estimation results for the samples with nine or more
consecutive observations in the German and Danish data.18 The permanent component is
estimated to be close to a random walk using the moments in differences, but slightly less
persistent using the moments in levels. Importantly, in both datasets the variance of the
permanent shock is about two times larger in the estimation that uses the moments in growth
rates, while the estimated variance of the transitory shock is larger using the moments in
levels. Thus, our administrative data exhibit the same large discrepancy that is endemic in
this literature. The pattern is less pronounced in the Danish data which is consistent with
the mechanism we describe. In the Danish data, 65% of individuals have complete earnings
spells, while in the German data this number is only 52%. Consequently, fewer individuals
have irregular earnings observations adjacent to the missing ones in the Danish data.19
16
One of the recent exceptions is Browning, Ejrnæs, and Alvarez (2010) who, apart from selected moments
in levels and differences, fit a variety of other data moments studied in the literature on earnings dynamics.
17
In the previous version of the paper, we allowed for an AR(1) transitory component instead with little
influence on the results.
18
In differences, the variance of fixed effects is not identified.
19
Randomly dropping individuals with incomplete earnings histories in the German data to match their
share in the Danish data results in similar discrepancies across the two datasets.

16

3.3.2

Samples with 20 or more not necessarily consecutive observations

Columns (5)–(8) in Table 3 contain the results for the samples with 20 or more not necessarily
consecutive observations. The variances of persistent shocks are somewhat smaller than those
in columns (1)–(4), whereas the variances of transitory shocks are similar in magnitude. Importantly, we still observe that estimations using the moments in differences deliver relatively
higher estimates of the variance of permanent shocks, while estimations in levels deliver relatively higher estimates of the variance of transitory shocks, once again confirming the widely
documented discrepancy.20
3.3.3

Balanced samples

Estimation results based on the balanced samples are reported in columns (9)–(12) of Table 3.
Relative to the estimates on the unbalanced samples discussed above, the use of balanced
samples results in a more than 50% reduction of the variance of permanent shocks when using
the moments in differences. There is a similarly striking reduction of at least 50% in the
variance of transitory shocks when using the moments in levels. It appears that the use of
balanced samples largely eliminates the discrepancy between the estimates of the earnings
process in levels and differences.

3.4

A Closer Look at Unbalanced Samples

The results of estimation on balanced and unbalanced samples indicate that the discrepancy
between the estimates based on the moments in levels and differences is specific to unbalanced
samples. One possible explanation for this finding is that individuals with shorter earnings
spells are intrinsically different, and that while permanent/transitory decomposition in Eq. (1)
is appropriate for workers in the balanced sample, it provides a fundamentally misspecified
model of the earnings processes for individuals in the unbalanced samples. Alternatively,
it is possible that the decomposition is essentially valid but that individuals in unbalanced
panels either have higher shock variances or represent a selection of workers who experienced
earnings “shocks” unfavorable enough to push them out of employment. One consequence of
such selection is that the earnings surrounding the missing observations are likely to belong
to workers in transit into or out of employment, with a potentially large impact on earnings
in those periods. As discussed in Section 2, this can induce the difference in the estimates of
the earnings process in growth rates or levels.
20

As was the case with nine or more consecutive observations, the discrepancy is less pronounced in the
Danish data because the share of individuals with complete earnings spells is larger, and the share of missing
earnings observations in the potential number of earnings observations (calculated as (T − t0 + 1) × N , where
N is the number of individuals in a sample) is smaller than in the German data.

17

Indeed, Figure 1 in the Introduction revealed a clear pattern that the earnings at the
start and/or the end of incomplete earnings spells are considerably lower on average and
substantially more volatile than typical earnings observations. To explore these patterns
more formally, in columns (1)–(4) of Table 4 we report the estimates from the fixed-effects
panel regressions of residual earnings on dummies for the first and last years of individual
earnings spells inside the overall sample window. Specifically, the dummies “Year observed:
first”–“Year observed: third” equal one if an individual’s first earnings record in the sample
occurs later than 1984 in the German data (later than 1981 in the Danish data), and zero
otherwise, while the dummies “Year observed: second-to-last”–“Year observed: last” equal
one if an individual’s last earnings record is prior to 2008 in the German data (2006 in the
Danish data), and zero otherwise.21
In both samples and both datasets, earnings are about 0.50 to 0.60 log points lower than
an individual’s average in the first year of the spell, whereas the last earnings record is below
an individual’s average by about 0.30 to 0.40 log points. Earnings are still lower in the two
years following the first earnings record as well as in the two years preceding the last earnings
record. Moreover, earnings are, on average, also lower in the years preceding and following a
missing earnings record in the non-consecutive samples. Clearly, the “shock” in the first year
of an individual’s spell is transitory, but somewhat persistent.22 Interestingly, the dummies for
the few first and last earnings records within a spell explain 5 to 13 percent of the variation in
residual earnings. This number is quite high taking into account that a variety of observable
factors normally explain about 30 percent of variation in earnings.
Performing the same experiment in reverse, we use our samples with 20 or more not necessarily consecutive observations to assess the predictive power of earnings dynamics for the
incidence of missing earnings. Specifically, in Table A-2, the dependent variable is a dummy
that equals 100 if individual earnings are missing and 0 otherwise. We find that the predictive power of observables – earnings growth rates before and after missing earnings records,
together with education dummies and age – on the incidence of missing earnings is quite
small, in line with Fitzgerald, Gottschalk, and Moffitt (1998) who made a similar observation
using PSID data. The strong (weak) earnings growth after (before) missing records lacks high
explanatory power for a missing record because there are also many declines and subsequent
recoveries of earnings inside uninterrupted earnings spells, as can be seen, e.g., in Figure 1
panel (a). Nonetheless, missing observations are associated with positive earnings growth
21

To reinforce the conclusion that patterns in Table 4 are actually driven by starting and ending of the
earnings spells, in Table A-1 we repeat the same analysis by focusing on individuals whose earnings spells
begin in the first sample year or end in the last sample year. For the vast majority of these individuals, such
cutoffs do not represent an actual start or end of their earnings spells; instead, the sample window mechanically
truncates earnings spells in progress. Accordingly, the first (last) few dummies equal one if an individual’s fist
(last) earnings record is in the first (last) sample year, and zero otherwise.
22
If the shock were permanent, it would elevate earnings in all periods, with no distinguishable differences
in the first earnings record from the individual’s average.

18

in the periods following a missing record and with negative earnings growth in the periods
preceding a missing earnings record, implying that these individual realizations of residual
earnings are not random draws from the earnings distribution. As pointed out by Moffitt and
Gottschalk (2012), little is known about the effect of attrition on the autocovariance function
of earnings and, therefore, on the estimates of the earnings process. Our results indicate that
the effect can be large.
In columns (5)–(8) of Table 4, we proceed to explore the volatility of idiosyncratic earnings
at the start and end of earnings spells. The size of squared residual earnings is mechanically
higher in the few first and last earnings records since, as we have just seen, residual earnings
are more negative, on average, in those periods. To remove the influence of this mechanical
effect, we take the (individually demeaned) residuals from the regressions of columns (1)–(4),
and then square them. In the German data, the overall mean of squared residual earnings is
about 0.15 in both samples while in the Danish data, the corresponding mean in both samples
is 0.11. The results imply that earnings are significantly more volatile in the (few) first and
last years of individual spells. For example, in the German data, the mean of squared residual
earnings in the first year is about 153% (100 × 0.23/0.15) larger than the typical size measured
by the mean of squared residual earnings in the sample. In the German consecutive sample,
about 23% of individuals have their first earnings record after 1984, the first calendar year
of the sample, and about 31% of individuals have their last record before 2008, the last year
of the sample. The same numbers for Danish data are 18% and 22%, respectively. This is
a non-trivial number of individuals with pronounced differences in the level and volatility of
residual earnings in the few first and last periods of earnings spells. In the non-consecutive
samples, earnings in the periods preceding and following interior missing earnings records are
also highly volatile. In the German data, for instance, the volatility of earnings observations
one year before a missing record is about 100% (100 × 0.15/0.15) larger than the volatility of
typical earnings observations. Tables 1 and 2 indicate that the fraction of missing earnings in
the non-consecutive samples is also quite large – over 5% in the German data and 14% in the
Danish data.
Finally, we consider some of the economic forces leading to low and volatile earnings at
the start and end of the earnings spells. One obvious explanation is based on the fact that
the data on earnings are typically recorded at an annual frequency. An individual who is,
say, entering the sample for the first time is (statistically) expected to enter in the middle
of the year, but may enter at any point throughout the year. Thus, earnings in that year
are expected to be lower and have a larger variance than interior earnings observations from
contiguous earnings histories. We can assess this conjecture using our German data which
contain information on the number of days worked on all jobs and the average daily wage
from all jobs held during a year. We use these data to decompose earnings cuts in the years
around missing earnings records due to reduction in days worked and wages. As can be seen
19

from Table 5, most of the reduction in earnings in the first or last year of the earnings spell is
due to the reduction in days worked. The reduction in wages in those years is non-trivial as
well, but becomes relatively more important for earnings fluctuations two or three years away
from the start or the end of the earnings spell.23
In Table A-3, we report that years at the start and at the end of earnings spells are
associated with a significant increase in the probability of occupation (three-digit) and industry
(two-digit) change as well as a higher incidence of unemployment. On average, the fraction
of individuals, in the cohort we study, who change occupation in a given year is 5%, declining
over the life cycle from 8% among those observed in 1984 (at ages 29–33) to 2% in 2008 (at
ages 53–57). For those individuals who enter the sample later than 1984, the probability of
an occupational switch increases (controlling for age effects) by about 31 percentage points
in the first year. A qualitatively similar picture holds for changes in industrial affiliation (on
average, individuals change industry about 4% of the time). Individuals continue experiencing
substantial occupation and industry mobility in the second and third years of incomplete
earnings spells, as well as in a few years prior to the end of the incomplete earnings spell.
This is consistent with a stronger labor-market attachment in the second and third years (and
next-to-last years) of the incomplete spells when the reduction in days worked is not as large
as the reduction in daily wages. In columns (3) and (6) of Table A-3, we show that individuals
are also substantially more likely to have spent part of the year unemployed in the few years
surrounding missing earnings records (on average, individuals in our sample are unemployed
about 3% of the time). In summary, irregular earnings records around the missing ones are due
to variation both in hours and wages associated with job, occupation, and industry mobility,
and lost work time due to spells of unemployment.

Quantitative Evaluation of the Mechanism
Direct Evaluation of the Biases Using the Permanent-Transitory
Decomposition Moments

In this section, we directly verify that irregular observations surrounding the missing ones
induce most of the difference between permanent and transitory shock variances implied by
identifying moments (L1)–(L2) and (D1)–(D2). As an example of computing these implied
variances, we calculate an estimate of the permanent variance at time t using the identifying
23

Consistently with the logic of our argument, we find much smaller differences in the estimated variances
of permanent and transitory shocks when using the moments in levels and differences in wages, as much of the
variability in earnings in our administrative datasets at the start and end of contiguous spells is due to the
variability in hours. This finding is consistent with the observation of Krueger, Perri, Pistaferri, and Violante
(2010) that the discrepancy is larger for the estimates of earnings processes than wage processes in a broad
cross-section of countries.

We can similarly define the variances of permanent and transitory shocks in levels and differences for the consecutive unbalanced panels – e.g., the permanent variance utilizing all
2
2
sample information (σξ,l,t
for levels and σξ,d,t
for differences), the permanent variance due to
2
irregular observations in the first and last few periods of an individual’s earnings spell (σξ,l,o,t
2
2
2
and σξ,d,o,t
), and the permanent variance net of their effects (σξ,l,n,t
and σξ,d,n,t
).
We present the estimates of those variances, averaged across all sample years, for both
datasets in Table 6. For the German data, in the consecutive sample, the estimates of the
variance of permanent shocks in levels and differences using all sample information are 0.013
and 0.024, respectively.24 Net of the effect of observations surrounding the missing ones, the
24
The estimates deviate from the values in Table 3 because we do not impose the exact permanent-transitory
decomposition on the data in the minimum-distance estimation of Table 3. The difference between the estimated variance of permanent shocks in levels and differences is not as drastic as in Table 3 because the
estimated persistence of the permanent shocks in levels is estimated to be lower than in differences in the

21

2
2
estimated variances are σ̂ξ,l,n
= 0.010 in levels and σ̂ξ,d,n
= 0.010 in differences. The unadjusted
variances of transitory shocks in levels and differences are estimated at 0.020 and 0.008,
respectively, while the variances net of outliers in levels and differences are both estimated
at 0.007. The results for the Danish data are qualitatively similar. Clearly, the discrepancy
between the estimates of permanent and transitory shock variances in levels and differences
is virtually eliminated when netting out the effects of irregular observations surrounding the
missing ones.
Similarly, in the German non-consecutive sample, the variances of permanent shocks are

σξ,l
= 0.0096, σξ,l,n

shocks are σ,l = 0.018, σ,l,n = 0.007, σ,d = 0.007, σ,d,n
= 0.007. Netting out the influence
of missing observations and the influence of the first and last records in the earnings spells
eliminates most of the discrepancy between the variances of permanent and transitory shocks
in differences and levels.

4.2

Restricting Unbalanced Samples

One approach to eliminating the impact of low mean and high variance of observations at the
start and end of earnings spells on the estimates of the permanent/transitory decomposition
is to simply drop those observations. Accordingly, in Tables 7 and 8, columns (3) and (4) of
Panel A, we repeat our analysis of Table 3 using the German and Danish samples with nine or
more consecutive observations after dropping the first three observations for individuals whose
earnings spells start after the first sample year and the last three observations for individuals
whose earnings spells end before the last sample year.25 In the same columns in Panel B
we, in addition, drop three observations before and after a missing earnings record in the
non-consecutive samples.
For the sample with nine or more consecutive observations, doing so barely affects the persistence of permanent shocks, although their variance estimated using the moments in differences is reduced by about 70%. The variance of transitory shocks estimated using the moments
in levels is reduced by about 60%. We observe a similar pattern in the non-consecutive sample
in Panel B. As a result, the estimated earnings process is virtually identical in estimations
utilizing the moments for growth rates and levels.
A comparison with Table 3 also indicates, consistent with the analysis in Section 2, that
in both datasets the variance of the permanent component is more robustly estimated using
minimum-distance estimation.
25
Geweke and Keane (2000) drop the first and Baker and Solon (2003) drop the first and last earnings
records in their analysis because individuals are likely to work only part of the year the first and last time
they are observed which is consistent with our results. Dropping the first and last records, however, may not
be enough to eliminate the biases as the records in a few subsequent or preceding years may be different from
the rest of earnings observations, reproducing the bias that had been created by the (dropped) first and last
earnings records.

differences.

4.3

Modeling Irregular Earnings Records Surrounding the Missing
Ones

In columns (5)–(8) of Tables 7 and 8, instead of dropping observations surrounding the missing
ones, we estimate an extended earnings process that explicitly models them. Specifically, we
estimate the following model:
yit = αi + pit + τit + χit , t = t0 , . . . , T
pit = φp pit−1 + ξit
τit = it + θit−1


 νit if yit−k or yit+k is missing and t − k ≥ t0 , t + k ≤ T , j = 0
χit+j =
θνit j = 1


0
otherwise.

(5)

In columns (5) and (6) of Tables 7 and 8, k = 1, i.e., we isolate only the first and last
observation of an earnings spell (if it is different from the first or last year of the sample
window), while in columns (7) and (8), k = {1, 2, 3} – to isolate the corresponding first three
and last three observations in an incomplete earnings spell. The means and variances of those
observations are targeted by matching the regression coefficients from Table 4. We assume that
νit is drawn from distributions with means and variances that depend on whether an individual
has missing observations in the interior of a non-consecutive earnings spell, in the beginning
of a consecutive earnings spell, or in the end of a consecutive earnings spell (the corresponding
means and variances have superscripts m, f, and l, respectively, in Appendix Tables A-4–A-7,
which contain full estimation results).26 Note that allowing for separate shocks in the second
and third observations after the missing ones (as well as a few observations prior to the missing
ones) is consistent with the evidence of elevated occupation and industry mobility in those
periods of individual spells in Table A-3. We further assume that the persistence of the shock
νit , θ, is the same as the persistence of the it shock because the estimated persistence of the
transitory component barely changes when we drop observations surrounding the missing ones,
which can be verified by comparing the results in columns (3)–(4) with the results in columns
(1)–(2).27 As before, the other moments used for estimating the model are the autocovariance
26

By construction, incomplete consecutive earnings spells have missing observations from t0 to ti0 , and/or
from T0i to T0 , where ti0 and T0i are the first and last years of individual i’s incomplete earnings spell.
27
We have verified that allowing for a different persistence of the ν shock yields similar results.

23

moments in either levels or differences. We rely on the simulated minimum distance method,
assuming that all of the innovations are i.i.d. normal, and utilize the optimal weighting matrix
estimated by block-bootstrap.28
Estimating the extended earnings process results in substantial reduction of the estimated
variance of permanent shocks in differences and of transitory shocks in levels.29 Note that when
estimating the extended process, it is essential to account for the observations immediately
adjacent the missing ones, because the other irregular observations will be subsumed in the
estimated variance of transitory shocks (as the data allow to observe earnings before and
after those earnings records that would help in detecting mean-reversion of those shocks if the
irregular observation immediately adjacent to the missing one is controlled for).30 This is in
contrast to the experiment discussed in the previous section in which it was necessary to drop
all three observations surrounding the missing one. Dropping the first observation only leads
to the second irregular observation being next to the missing one, and induces the associated
biases in the estimated variances of permanent and transitory shocks in levels and differences.

4.4

Simulation

Finally, for completeness, we present a suggestive simulation, consistent with the German data,
aimed at replicating the results for the consecutive and non-consecutive samples presented
above. We replicate our German unbalanced samples in terms of the number of person-year
observations and assume that incomes in the spells starting (ending) in the years other than
the first (last) year of the sample are, in addition, affected by a transitory shock, which has a
negative mean and high variance as in Table 4.
For the consecutive sample, we assume that persistence of the permanent component is
0.980, the variance of permanent shocks is 0.008, persistence of the transitory component is
0.170, the variance of transitory shocks is 0.010, and the variance of fixed effects is 0.025. These
values are similar to the estimates of the transitory component using the moments in growth
rates and of the permanent component using the moments in levels in Table 3, columns (1)–
28

Because it is well known that earnings shocks are non-Gaussian, we have also tried estimations which
assume that the shocks are drawn from a Student t-distribution with the degrees of freedom estimated from
the data by matching kurtosis of the growth in earnings observed in the data. We found that the point
estimates in Tables A-4–A-5 were virtually the same (with the estimated degrees of freedom of the Student
t-distribution equal to about 4, implying a leptokurtic distribution of the shocks). This is not surprising, since
the discrepancy in the estimated variances is the feature of the second moments of the data – and not the
higher-order moments – as is highlighted in Eq. (D1)–(L2).
29
The estimated variance of permanent shocks in growth rates is now smaller than in levels in Table A-4 but
if we restrict the persistence of permanent shocks to one in column (5), the estimated variances of permanent
and transitory shocks in levels and differences become virtually the same.
30
It is clear from the precision of our estimates that allowing for the means and variances of ν-shocks is not
redundant in fitting the data moments; e.g., the quasi-likelihood ratio test’s p-values for excluding σν2f , σν2l ,
t

µlν f , and µlν l in the estimation of column (5) Table A-6 are all well below 1%.

(2). We assume that the shocks and fixed effects are drawn from Student t-distributions
with four degrees of freedom, since our samples have high excess kurtosis.31 We take the
means and variances of the ν-shocks in the first three and last three periods from columns (1)
and (5) of Table 4. The results, averaged across 100 simulations, are in Table 9. Utilizing the
full sample results in overestimation of the variance of the permanent (transitory) shock in
differences (levels), and it appears that the permanent component is more robustly estimated
utilizing the moments in levels while the transitory component is closer to the truth utilizing
the moments in differences. Reassuringly, our full-sample estimation results are similar to the
data results in Table 3. Dropping the first three and last three observations in an individual’s
spell aligns the results in levels and differences – see columns (3) and (4) – and correctly
recovers the parameters of the underlying earnings process.
For the non-consecutive sample, we assume that persistence of the permanent component
is 0.999, the variance of permanent shocks is 0.005, persistence of the transitory component is
0.20, the variance of transitory shocks is 0.01, and the variance of fixed effects is 0.024. This
is in line with the estimated permanent component in column (5) and transitory component
in column (6) of Table 3. We take the means and variances of ν-shocks in the first three
and last three periods, and three years before and three years after missing earnings records,
from columns (3) and (7) of Table 4, and assume that the shocks follow the moving-average
structure of order 1 with the persistence equal to 0.20. The reported results are averages across
100 simulations. The full-sample estimation results in estimates close to the data estimates
in Table 3, and recovers fairly well the permanent component using the moments in levels,
and the transitory component using the moments in differences – columns (5) and (6) of
Table 9. Dropping the first three and last three observations in an individual’s spell, as well
as observations surrounding interior missing records, once again aligns the estimates in levels
and differences.

4.5

Implications

The experiments described in this Section suggest that no other mechanisms but the presence of irregular earnings observations around missing earnings records are responsible for the
discrepancy in the estimated variances of the shocks in levels and differences in our administrative earnings data. The practical implications of these findings depend on the objective of
the analysis. If one is interested in the properties of permanent and transitory components
as well as in the detailed analysis of earnings at the start and end of employment spells, one
can estimate the extended process in Eq. (5) where the mean and the variance of the shocks
at the beginning and the end of contiguous earnings histories are readily identified from the
31

Assuming normal shocks instead has no impact on our findings. The choice of degrees of freedom for a
Student t-distribution of the shocks is consistent with the data; see footnote (28).

mean and the variance of earnings in those periods. Many macro models are too stylized,
however, to incorporate explicit treatment of these observations. They use as an input only
the permanent/transitory components of the earnings process, as in Eq. (1) and it is crucial
to obtain the correct estimates of the stochastic properties of these components in the data.
These components can be estimated using the extended earnings process in Eq. (5), although
simpler alternatives are also available. First, we have shown theoretically and verified empirically, that the variance of the transitory shock is estimated with no bias when estimation
is based on the moments for earnings growth rates if the ν-shock is not serially correlated,
and the variance of the permanent shock is unbiased when estimation targets the moments
in levels. One could therefore use the estimated permanent component from targeting the
moments in levels and the estimated transitory component from targeting the moments in
growth rates. An alternative approach is to estimate the earnings process in Eq. (1) on the
data that do not include the observations surrounding the missing ones. As we have shown,
this solution recovers the true parameters of this abbreviated process quite well.

Conclusion

Properties of the earnings process play an important role in various areas of macro and labor
economics. Different specifications of this process have been explored in the literature, but
the most widely used one is based on decomposing earnings into the sum of persistent and
transitory components, where the persistent component is often assumed to follow a random
walk. The parameters of such a process can be identified using the moments based on earnings
growth rates (first-difference in log earnings) or the moments based on log earnings levels.
Historically, the former approach is more common in labor economics, while the latter is
more common in the macroeconomics literature. Unfortunately, these two approaches lead
to dramatically different estimates of the variances of permanent and transitory components.
In particular, using the same set of observations in the data, the variance of the persistent
component is typically estimated to be much higher when the moments in growth rates are
targeted, while the variance of the transitory component is found to be much higher when
the estimation is based on fitting the moments in levels. This has important implications
for substantive economic analysis. For example, the earnings process drives the heterogeneity
in Bewley-type models with incomplete markets, and the variances of earnings components
determine not only economic choices, such as consumption, and savings, but also the optimal
design of policies, such as taxes and transfers. Moreover, the standard approach to estimating
the amount of insurance that individuals have against permanent and transitory shocks in
the data relies on the estimated variances of permanent and transitory components. The
uncertainty about the size of these variances translates into uncertainty regarding the right

26

amount of insurance that should be generated by the widely used incomplete markets models,
and the associated uncertainty about the results of welfare analyses using those models.
In this paper, we uncovered the features of the data that can quantitatively account for
the large difference in the estimates based on earnings growth rates and levels at least in the
administrative data from Denmark and Germany. In particular, we found that earnings are
lower on average and more volatile at the start and end of continuous earnings spells. We
have shown theoretically that these irregular earnings observations, which are either preceded
or followed by a missing observation, induce an upward bias in the estimates of the variance
of permanent shocks based on the moments in differences and the variance of transitory
shocks when estimation is based on the moments in levels. Thus, even when working with
very large administrative datasets with highly reliable information, one must remain vigilant
because such natural features of the datasets as low mean and high variance of earnings at the
start and end of earnings spells can induce extremely large biases in the estimated earnings
processes.
While the primary focus of this paper is on estimating earnings processes on large administrative datasets that are becoming central in the literature, the mechanism we describe also
applies to survey-based PSID data on hourly wages, individual earnings, combined earnings
of husbands and wives, and net family income. This is important, in part, because the PSID
data are the primary source of information on the extent of consumption insurance achieved
by U.S. households and on the sources of insurance, such as household savings and borrowing
or the public transfer and tax system. Hryshko and Manovskii (2018) find that correcting
the measurement of family income dynamics for the effects of the low mean and high variance of the observations surrounding the missing ones as proposed in this paper leads to a
very different assessment of the degree and sources of consumption insurance relative to the
key empirical benchmark for incomplete markets models provided by Blundell, Pistaferri, and
Preston (2008).
The punch line is that there clearly must be a tight correspondence between the components of the earnings process used in the model and the ones estimated in the data. If the
model utilizes a version of the permanent/transitory process as in Eq. (1), the measurement
of these permanent/transitory components in the data must not be biased due to the irregular nature of observations adjacent to the missing ones. If, on the other hand, one wishes
to incorporate the features of these observations into the model, one needs to estimate the
extended process in Eq. (5) in the data and use it as an input into the model. The paper
provides a way to implement both of these approaches.

Notes: Columns (1) and (2) reproduce the corresponding estimates from Table 3. In columns (1)–(4), the
estimated earnings process is: yit = αi + pit + τit , where pit+1 = φp pit + ξit+1 and τit+1 = it+1 + θit . In
columns (5)–(8), the estimated earnings process is in Eq. (5) in the text. Models are estimated using the
optimally weighted minimum distance method. Asymptotic standard errors are in parentheses. German
data span the period 1984–2008, while Danish data span the period 1981–2006. Full estimation results for
the models in columns (5)–(8) are contained in Tables A-4–A-5.

Notes: The true earnings process is in Eq. (5). In columns (1)–(4), σα2 = 0.025, φp = 0.98, σξ2 = 0.008,
θ = 0.170, σ2 = 0.01, while in columns (5)–(8), σα2 = 0.025, φp = 0.999, σξ2 = 0.005, φτ = 0.20, σ2 = 0.01.
In columns (3)–(4) the first 3 (last 3) observations are dropped if an individual’s earnings spell starts (ends)
later (earlier) than in 1984 (2008); in columns (7) and (8), in addition, three observations before and after
missing earnings records are dropped. The results are the averages across 100 simulations. The model
is estimated using the optimal weighting minimum distance method. Standard errors, calculated as the
standard deviations of the estimates across simulations, are in parentheses.

Notes: “Chg. occ.” (“Chg. ind.”) equals 100 if an individual had changed occupation (industry) between the
current year and the last year he had been observed in the sample, zero otherwise. “Unemp.” equals 100 if an
individual had been unemployed in the current year, zero otherwise. The dummies “Year observed: first”–“Year
observed: third” are equal to one if an individual’s first earnings record is later than in 1984, zero otherwise; “Year
observed: second-to-last”–“Year observed: last” are equal to one if an individual’s last earnings record is earlier than
in 2008, zero otherwise. We also control for the full set of age dummies in the regressions, and for the dummies that
equal one in the first three years of individual spells starting in the beginning of the sample, and the dummies that
equal one in the last three years of individual spells ending in the last sample year.

U.S. Survey Data from the PSID

Until recently, the research on earnings and wage dynamics has been largely based on survey
data from the PSID. In this appendix we show that the findings in this paper also apply to
these data. We consider PSID sample from Blundell, Pistaferri, and Preston (2008) containing
married male heads of household of ages 30–65 observed during the period 1979–1993. We
drop (just a few) top-coded male earnings observations and drop data for 1993.32 Hourly
wages are obtained as the ratio of male annual earnings and annual hours worked. We use the
same specification and controls as in Blundell, Pistaferri, and Preston (2008) to extract male
earnings and hourly wage residuals. We begin by documenting that the low mean and high
variance of earnings and wage observations surrounding the missing ones is also a feature of
PSID data.
Properties of observations surrounding the missing ones in PSID data. Replicating the analysis of administrative datasets in Section 3.4, Table A-8 contains the results of two
regressions, of earnings residuals and squared earnings residuals on the dummies for the first
and last observations of earnings spells, and observations surrounding missing records. Table A-10 contains the results of analogous regressions based on hourly wages. In columns (1)
and (3), the dummy “Year observed: first” equals 1 if an individual’s first earnings (wage)
record is after 1979, while the dummy “Year observed: last” equals 1 if an individual’s last
earnings (wage) record is prior to 1992. For comparison, in columns (2) and (4), these dummies equal 1 in the first and last year of the sample window, i.e., 1979 and 1992, respectively.
Wage (earnings) residuals are about 0.08 (0.10) log points lower in the few first (few first and
last) periods (if they differ from the first and last sample years) but are substantially lower in
the few periods right after wages (earnings) are missing.
In contrast, earnings and wage residuals are, for the most part, not different from the
unconditional mean of zero in the few first and last periods of the sample window – column
(2) of the two tables. In columns (3) and (4), we net out the mean effects of irregular
observations on the residuals, and then regress squared (net) residuals on the same dummies
as in columns (1) and (2), respectively. Squared residuals are lower in the few first sample
years and higher in the last sample years due to the well-known increase in male earnings
and wage inequality over the life cycle and over time – column (4). The volatility of earnings
(wages), however, is much higher in the first and last sample years if individuals’ first earnings
(wage) records are not in the first sample year and last earnings (wage) records are not in
the last sample year, as can be seen by comparing the first six regressors in columns (3) and
(4).33 We conclude that the patterns of low mean and high variance of earnings and wage
residuals around missing earnings records in the PSID data are qualitatively similar to those
in the Danish and German administrative data.
32

Our results are qualitatively similar if we keep earnings data for 1993. We drop them because the variance
of male earnings growth anomalously jumps by about 42% in 1993 when the PSID switches to a computerassisted telephone interview.
33
The coefficients on the dummies measure the variances in the respective periods relative to the average
variance in the sample overall measured by a constant. For instance, the estimated constant in the regression
of columns (3)–(4) in Table A-8 is 0.33, so that the variance of residual earnings in the first year for the
earnings spells that start in the first sample year equals 0.18 (=0.33 − 0.15), while the volatility of earnings in
the first year for earnings spells that start later than the first sample year equals 0.42. Similarly, the difference
in the volatility of earnings residuals in the last year for the spells that end earlier than the last sample year
and spells ending in the last sample year equals 0.52=0.63 − 0.11.

The impact of irregular observations surrounding the missing ones on the earnings
and wage process estimates in the PSID. Following Blundell, Pistaferri, and Preston
(2008), we estimate the earnings and wage processes assuming that the persistence of the
permanent component is one and the transitory component is an MA(1). Because variances
of log earnings and wages have a nontrivial time trend (see, e.g., Figure A-1), we allow
permanent and transitory variances to change over time in estimation, and report average
variances. To accommodate the pattern of missing observations, we estimate our models by
the simulated minimum distance method assuming that the shocks are drawn from normal
distributions. Since our focus is on fitting second moments only, this choice of distribution is
inconsequential for the results; we experimented with a Student t-distribution for the shocks
fitting, in addition, the fourth moments of the data but our results for the variances were
virtually the same. When estimating the earnings and wage process in levels, we assume
that individuals start accumulating shocks at age 25, and estimate the variance of permanent
shocks prior to 1979 as an additional parameter, to fit the variance of log male earnings and
log male wages in the first year of the sample. The variance of fixed effects is set to zero as it is
not separately identified from the variance of permanent shocks at age 25 when the permanent
component is a unit root process. A diagonal weighting matrix calculated by block-bootstrap
is used to weight the moments in all estimations.
The results are in Tables A-9 and A-11. The variance of permanent shocks estimated using
the moments in levels is 0.019 for earnings and 0.017 for wages, but 0.070 for earnings and
0.043 for wages using the moments in differences. The variance of transitory shocks using the
moments in levels is estimated at 0.18 for earnings and 0.108 for wages, but only 0.086 for
earnings and 0.06 for wages using the moments in differences.
As a first pass for assessing the impact of irregular observations surrounding the missing
ones on the estimates, we drop the first three and last three earnings (or wage) observations,
if an individual’s first record is after 1979 and the last record is prior to 1992, respectively, as
well as the three earnings (or wage) observations before and after missing earnings (or wage)
records. In these samples, the average variance of permanent shocks, using the moments in
levels, is estimated at about 0.019 for earnings and 0.017 for wages, practically the same as the
estimate for the whole sample. The estimated variance of permanent shocks using the moments
in differences is, however, substantially reduced from 0.070 to about 0.023 for earnings and
from 0.043 to 0.021 for wages. Similarly, while the variance of transitory shocks using the
moments in growth rates changes little after dropping these observations, the variance of
transitory shocks using the moments in levels is cut substantially. These patterns in the PSID
data are once again qualitatively similar to those in the Danish and German administrative
data.
Next, we explicitly recognize the presence of ν-shocks in the income and wage process as
in Eq. (5) and estimate the parameters of the extended model while retaining all earnings and
wage observations. As in Section 4.3, in addition to the standard income moments we use
the regression coefficients in Tables A-8 and A-10 to estimate the mean and variance effects
of ν-shocks. We allow for estimation of the mean and variance effects only for earnings and
wage observations right next to a missing record since we showed in the main text that this
is sufficient to align the estimated variances of permanent and transitory shocks in levels and
differences. Specifically, in the full estimation, in addition to all of the autocovariance moments
in the original estimation we also target the regression coefficients in two regressions, with
residuals and (net) squared earnings (wage) residuals on the left-hand side, and the 7 regressors
on the right-hand side: 2 dummies around interior missing earnings (wage) observations, 1
51

dummy for the first earnings (wage) records if the incomplete earnings (wage) spells start later
than the first sample year, 1 dummy for the first earnings (wage) records if spells start in the
first sample year, 1 dummy for the last earnings (wage) records if the incomplete earnings
spells end earlier than the last sample year, 1 dummy for the last earnings (wage) records if
earnings (wage) spells end in the last sample year, and a constant. The estimated variances
of permanent and transitory shocks in levels and differences reported in columns (5) and (6)
are similar to their values in the “dropping experiment” summarized in columns (3) and (4).
The consequences of misspecifying the earnings and wage process are clearly visible in
Figures A-1 and A-3. Panel (a) of the figures plots the variance of log earnings (wage) levels
in the PSID data over time (solid line) and the fit of various models to these data. The
short-dashed line plots the variance implied by the estimates of the model that targets the
moments of log earnings (wages) in differences and the moments for observations surrounding
the missing ones, while the long-dashed line plots the variance implied by targeting the moments for earnings (wages) in growth rates only. By the last sample year, the implied variance
of log earnings (log wages) greatly exceeds the variance in the data when we use the estimates
targeting the moments for growth rates only. This is the direct consequence of overestimating
the variances of permanent shocks when targeting the moments in differences. Targeting the
same moments in differences as well as the mean and variances of observations adjacent to
the missing ones, however, leads to a close match to the variance of earnings and wage levels
in the data (not targeted in estimation), as indicated by the short-dashed line.
Panel (b) of the figures indicates that the earnings and wage process in Eq. (5) estimated
by targeting to the moments in levels as well as means and variances of observations adjacent
to the missing ones provides a reasonably good fit to the (untargeted) moments for earnings
and wages in growth rates (solid line for the data moments and short-dashed line for the
moments implied by the estimated model). The estimation of the abbreviated process in
Eq. (1) targeting the moments in levels, however, substantially overpredicts the observed
earnings and wage growth variances (long-dashed line). This is obviously the consequence of
overestimating the variance of transitory shocks using the moments in levels.34

34

For completeness, Figures A-2 and A-4 panel (a) show that both the estimated process of Eq. (1) and
Eq. (5) targeting the moments in levels fit those moments fairly well. Similarly, Figures A-2 and A-4 panel (b)
indicate that both processes Eq. (1) and Eq. (5) estimated by targeting the variances of earnings or wage
growth rates provide a reasonably good fit to these variances in the data.
