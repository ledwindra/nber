China and India: Reforms and the Response: How Differently have the Economies Behaved

NBER Working Paper No. 19006
May 2013
JEL No. F00,F10,F21
ABSTRACT
The relative performance of China and India is compared using two different methods and they provide
a very different picture of their relative performance. We compare the average absolute values of indictors
for the decade of the 1980s, 1990s and the 2000s. We use indicators such as the current account balance
(CAB), exports of goods and services (XGS), foreign direct investment inflow (FDI), gross domestic
savings, gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), aid, private capital inflows (PrK) and workers’ remittances,
all as a percentage of GDP. We also look at the growth rate of per capita GDP, exports of goods and
services and of gross fixed capital formation.
Using a two tailed- test we find that China does better than India for most of these indicators. For instance,
China has a higher growth rate of per capita income, XGS and GFCF as also a higher share of XGS,
GFCF etc in GDP than does India. We also find that China usually has a lower CV, namely a more
stable performance. But over the three decades the CV falls in India so it is approaching that in China,
namely the two economies are becoming more similar.
We also compare the dynamic performance of the two economies since their reforms. We form index
numbers for the indicators. So for example, we from an index number for share of exports in GDP
with year 1 of reform in China being 100, i.e. the index for the share in 1979 is 100. Year 2 would
be the index number for 1980, namely the value of the share in 1980 with the share in 1979 being 100,
etc. In the case of India year 1 would be 1992 once the reforms started, year 2 would be 1993 and so
on, so the index would have 1992 as the base year. We find that the indices behave very similarly in
the two economies for many of the indicators, namely the pattern of change in China after 1979 is
the same as in India after 1992.

Section I Introduction
There is considerable analytical work comparing the economic performance of China
and India to understand the growth processes in these economies. Analysts have also sought to
examine the effect of their rapid growth on the world economy as well as on other developing
economies, particularly those in Africa.1 We do not discuss the reforms themselves which have
been extensively studied.2
How the two economies compare with each other depends on how the comparison is
made. We compare both the absolute values of many indicators as well as the change in the
values of the indicators since the reforms in the two economies. We compare indictors such as
the current account valance (CAB), exports of goods and services (XGS), foreign direct
investment inflow (FDI), gross domestic savings (GDS), gross fixed capital formation (GFCF),
aid (ODA), private capital inflows (PrK) and workers’ remittances, all as a percentage of GDP.

See for instance Winters and Shahid Yusuf (2007), Broadman (2007), Brautigam (2009), Cheru
and Obi (2010)
2 See Jikun Huang, Keijiro Otsuka and Scott Rozelle (2008) for agricultural reforms, Byrd
(1992) and Brandt, Rawski and Sutton (2008) for industrial sector reforms, Bahl and Wallich
(1992), Ma Jun (1995) and Wong and Bird (2008) for fiscal reforms, Allen, Qian and Qian (2008),
Geiger (2006), Green (2005) for reforms in the financial sector and the conduct of monetary
policy, and World Bank (2004) and the Trade Policy Reports of the WTO for the trade system
and changes in it. Also see Agarwal (2010) for an analysis of Chinese reforms. See Bhagwati
(1993) and Panagariya(2008) for an analysis of Indian reforms. The reforms are described in the
Economic Survey published every year by the Ministry of Finance before the budget is
presented to parliament.

We also look at the growth rate of per capita GDP, XGS, GFCF. We compare the average values
of these indicators for the decade of the 1980s, 1990s and the 2000s.
Using a two tailed- test we find that China does better than India for most of these
indicators. For instance, China has a higher growth rate of per capita income, XGS and GFCF as
also a higher share of XGS, GFCF etc in GDP than does India. We also calculate the coefficient
of variation (CV) for these indicators for these decades. We find that China usually has a lower
CV, namely a more stable performance. But only a few of the indictors show a lower CV over
the decades in the case of China. In the case of India, the CV declines over the decades for most
of the indicators. Thus over time the levels of the CV in India are approaching those in China,
namely the two economies are becoming more similar.
We also compare the two economies since their reforms as the reforms have influenced
their growth paths. When we do this we find a number of similarities. For instance, in every year
during the period 1979-2010, exports were a larger share in Chinese GDP than in Indian GDP
and China invested a larger share of its GDP. But if the comparison is made in terms of the
number of years since the reforms and taking into account the initial starting values then a
different picture emerges. So year 1 in China would be 1979 when the reforms started, year 2
would be 1980 etc. In the case of India year 1 would be 1992 once the reforms started, year 2
would be 1993 and so on. Also, we form an index with a base year value of 100 for the first year
of the reform. Though investment is a larger share of GDP in China than in India when the
values for the same year are compared, we find that the pattern of change in China after 1979 is
the same as in India after 1992. Similarly, a number of other indicators such as exports of goods
and services as share of GDP, share of manufactures in GDP or of services in GDP, show a

4

similar pattern of change in China and India if we compare them from the time of the respective
reforms.
The general perception is that China is a more open economy that has depended more
on exports of goods for its growth (Friedman and Gilley, 2005; Kotwal, Ramaswami and
Wadhwa, 2011). India’s success has been less dependent on exports and more dependent on
domestic demand. India has done better in exports of services while China has depended more on
exports of manufactures and this export has resulted in very rapid growth of the manufacturing
sector. China also has had much higher rates of investment than has India. Foreign direct
investment (FDI) has played an important role in the growth of China’s manufacturing sector and
in its export success. FDI has played no particular role in India’s growth story. We examine the
relative economic performance of China and India in Section II. This analysis bears out the
above story in absolute terms. But then, in section III, we examine the performance since their
respective reforms and find more similarities than differences, and the perceptions noted above
do not generally hold.

Section II: Relative Economic Performance in China and India

We compare the economic performance of China and India in the context of both the
global and regional economies, paying particular attention to performance in developing country
regions.1 Both China and India have been growing rapidly in recent years, and are narrowing the
difference in per capita incomes with the developed countries though in many other developing
countries the difference in per capita incomes with the developed economies has increased
(Table 1). Per capita incomes in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have barely grown over the past
thirty years as they increased by an average of merely 0.3% a year between 1980 and 2009;
during this same period per capita incomes in Latin America have grown at only about 1 per cent
a year. Since per capita incomes in the high income countries grew at 1.9 percent a year the gap
between incomes in SSA and Latin America and the high income countries has increased. The
Chinese and Indian economies have grown considerably faster – about two to three times the
average world rate.

of government policies regarding skill formation and technological development in the two
economies. He also emphasizes the importance of the decentralized experimental basis of reform
in China. Also see Friedman and Gilley (2005) and Winters and Shahid Yusuf (2007)

There has in general been an acceleration of growth in developing countries in the 4
regions in the period 2000-2009 compared to the period 1990-2000 in all sectors, agriculture,
manufacturing and services, (Table 2); only growth of manufacturing decelerated in EAP and of
agriculture in SA. Furthermore there was significant acceleration in the rate of growth of valueadded in services in EAP, SSA and SA. This acceleration of growth has meant that the increasing
gap in per capita incomes between the high income countries and countries in LAC and SSA has
been reversed for this period; though as noted above the gap increases for the entire period 19802009 despite this improvement during 2000-09.

When it comes to China and India, China has posted much higher rates of growth in all
the three sectors than India. But the significant acceleration in India in the rates of growth of
manufacturing and services output during the period 2000-2009 compared to the earlier period
suggests that the gap in performance between China and India may be narrowing1.
These differential sector rates of growth determine the structure of production in the
different regions and in the two countries China and India. What is particularly striking is that
the share of manufacturing in GDP is much higher in EAP than the other regions. Furthermore,
this share has declined n regions other than EAP. Also share of agriculture in GDP has dropped
in Asia but for very different reasons. This has happened in EAP despite rapid growth in
agricultural output whereas in SA growth of agricultural output has been almost the lowest
among the different regions (Table 3).

A panel regression analysis of 109 developed and developing countries for the period
1980-2009 shows significant differences between Asian and Latin American countries, and also
between China and India (Lele, Agarwal, Timmer and Goswami, 2012). In Latin America the
actual share of agricultural value-added in GDP is larger than predicted and agriculture’s share in
employment is less than predicted. The major difference in Asia is that the share of agriculture in
employment is larger than predicted, and the positive residuals have been increasing over time.
This is true for both China and India, though the residuals are much larger for China than for
India.1 This contrasts, for instance, with Brazil where the residuals for employment are negative
and have been becoming more negative. The Asian economies, in contrast to those in Latin
America, have not been able to generate enough non-agricultural employment.
The share of services in GDP is the lowest in Asia. While the share of agriculture in
GDP is larger in India (18%) than in China (15%), it has been falling more rapidly in India
where agricultural productivity has grown more slowly than in China. 2 The share of
manufacturing in GDP was already much higher in China in 1979 than in India, and has

Kotwal, Ramaswami and Wadhwa (2011) compare behaviour employment in agriculture to
that in the now developed countries but not to other developing countries. Our analysis suggests
that the behavior in India is typical of land scarce Asian countries
2 The conclusion holds whether productivity is measured per hectare or per worker or whether
measures of total factor productivity are used (Lele, Agarwal, Timmer and Goswami, 2012).

remained much higher. However, the services sector is much larger in India.

Again the

performance of Asia contrasts with that of LAC.
Economic performance in Asia and within it of China and India has been propelled by
investment. Investment ratios in East Asia are almost twice those in Africa and Latin America
(Table 4). Investment rates in SA have been increasing, and though still considerably lower than
in EAP may soon approach those levels. China invests even more than other countries in its
region, almost half its GDP; India in recent years has invested about a third of its GDP slightly
more than other countries in its region. Also, the investment ratio is more similar between China
and India than it is for either country with the ratio in LAC or SSA.

But not only are investment levels in Asia higher than other developing country regions,
there is greater efficiency in the use of capital as measured by the incremental capital output ratio
(ICOR). After the oil price rise of 1973 the capital output doubled in the rest of the world and it
is has remained high since (Agarwal, 2008). But it increased considerably less in East Asia and it
actually declined in South Asia so that since the early 1980s it has been the same in East and
South Asia.

The incremental capital output ratio was considerably lower in China than in India till
1998 (Figure 1).1 Since then the ICOR in the two countries has been roughly the same.

The capital output ratio is calculated as the moving average of the sum of investment over 5
years divided by the increase in income during this period with a one year lag, i.e, ∑i=15 Ii/(Y6-Y1)

The share of exports of goods and services in GDP has increased in all the developing
country regions and the most in SA. The share of exports of goods and services has also
increased in India but remains less than in China so that it remains less export oriented. But again
the ratios are becoming more similar between China and India than of either country with LAC
or SSA.
Trade in services has increased faster than trade in goods in recent years though from a
much lower level. World exports of goods increased fromUS$3468.4 billion in 1990 to
US$6429.5 billion in 2000, an increase of 85 %, and to US$12228.0 billion in 2009, an increase
of 90 %. Meanwhile world exports of services increased from US$876.7 billion in 1990 to
US$1566.5 billion in 2000, an increase of 79 % and to US$3517.4 billion in 2009, an increase of
124 %. However, developing countries in general have not fared as well in exports of services as
they have in exports of goods as their share is considerably lower. The share of developing
countries in world exports of good increased from 23.6 % in 1990 to 30.4 % in 2009. During this
period the share of developing countries in world exports of services increased from 13.6 % in
1990 to 19.3 % in 2009. Share of most developing country regions except Asia in world exports
of services has declined. China and India have both participated in the increase in exports of
goods and services, and separately in goods and services. China’s share in world exports of
goods increased from 1.6 % in 1990 to 9.6 % in 2009 while its share of exports of services
increased from 0.7 % in 1990 to 3.8 % in 2009. On the other hand India’s share of world exports
of goods increased from 0.5 % in 1990 to 1.3 % in 2009, while its share of services exports
increased from 0.6 % in 1990 to 2.6 % in 2009. This shows that China increased its exports of
services faster than India. But China has larger earnings from tourism. Its share of world exports

12

of computer, information and other commercial services increased from 1.4 percent to 4.1
percent between 1990 and 2009 whereas India’s increased from 0.4 percent to 4.1 percent.
Despite the success of the two economies in increasing exports the behavior of the
current account has been different for the two economies. China has usually had a surplus on the
current account and at times this surplus has been very large and China has accumulated large
reserves. India, on the other hand, has usually run deficits and in recent years these deficits have
become very large raising the question of the sustainability of the growth process.

Section III How Different is India’s Experience with Liberalization Compared to China’s
III.1 Comparing the performance over the same period
The general perception is that China is a more open economy that has depended more
on exports of goods for its growth. India’s success has been less dependent on exports and more
dependent on domestic demand. India, however, has done better in exports of services while
China has depended more on exports of manufactures and this export has resulted in very rapid
growth of the manufacturing sector. China also has had much higher rates of investment than has
India. This general perception is borne out by the data on the performance of the two economies.
We calculate the behavior of a number of indicators over the period 1981 to 2010
(Table 5). We generally find that China does better on the basis of these indicators than India
does. India does better only in the inflow of workers’ remittances throughout the period.
However, the differences in the rates of growth of XGS and of GFCF are not significant at the 5
percent level.

The average rate of growth of exports of goods and services was higher in India in the
1980s than it was in China, even though the share of XGS in GDP remained higher in China. But
in China the share of XGS in GDP increased from 12.3 in the 1980s to 20.6 percent in the
nineties, whereas in India it increased from 5,9 percent to 10.5 percent between these two
periods. Another difference between the two economies was that the Indian economy was more
dependent on aid than was the Chinese economy.
We now look at the stability of the economy in terms of the behavior of these 12
indicators. The coefficient of variation of most of the indicators have decreased, eight have a
lower CV in the 1990s than the 1980s and 8 have a lower CV further in the 2000s (Table 6). For
China also the CV declines but for fewer indicators, 8 less in the 1990s than the 1980s and 6 less
in the 2000s than in the 1990s. Leaving aside the CAB/GDP indicator, of the other 11 indicators
the CV is lower in India for only 3 in the 1980s and 1990 and only 2 in the 2000s. There is no
indicator which has a consistently lower CV in India. A number of indicators, 5, have a
consistently lower CV in China. Though the Indian economy is becoming more stable it is as yet
15

not as stable as the Chinese economy. As far as the CAB/GDP indicator is concerned it is
negative for India and positive for China so CV is greater in China than in India. But if we look
at the absolute size, we find that over time the CV has been decreasing in China, but has been
increasing in India. So not only is the deficit CAB becoming larger in India it is showing greater
variability.

III.2 Comparing since the reforms
There is another way and we believe a more fruitful way of analyzing the performance
of the two economies. Since the performance of the two economies has, it is believed, been
propelled by liberalization the performances should be measured since the start of the
liberalization. Rather than look at calendar time we should date the performance of China since
1979 and of India since 1992. For China, 1979 would be year 1, 1980 year 2 and so on. For
India, year 1 would be 1992, year 2 would be 1993 and so on. Also we calculate the changes
since the reform since the countries had different starting positions. When we do this we get a
different picture. China grows considerably faster than India with a widening gap in per capita
incomes (Figure 2).

19 years after reform per capita income in China was 450 percent of that in the initial
year whereas it was only 250 percent in India.
But a slightly different picture emerges if we plot the year to year growth rates in per
capita income. The difference in growth rates was larger in the first ten years of the reform and
has narrowed since then (Figure 3). Furthermore though the average growth rate was higher in
China the variability was also higher. The average annual growth rate of per capita income was
8.7 percent in China and was 5.1 percent in India. But the variance of this growth rate was 10.8
in China and 4.5 in India.

China has achieved this rapid growth with remarkable price stability. Inflation has
usually been low and lower than in India. A few years are an exception to this behavior. Inflation
was higher in China and by a considerable margin in the years 1988 and 1989 and again later in

18

the years 1993 to 1995. There is, however, considerable similarity in the behavior of some of the
other indicators.
China is believed to have been much more successful in exporting than India.
Undoubtedly, the share of exports of goods and services (XGS) in GDP has been higher in China
throughout the period 1979-2011 (Figure 4). But we note that the difference which had grown
from about 2 percent in 1979 to 12 percent in 1994 was narrowing gradually till 2002, when it
grew rapidly to 18 percent in 2006. Since then it dropped to only 4 percent in 2011. In this
diagram the common area is 52 percent and the difference in areas is 48 percent of the entire
area.

The similarity in the behavior of share of XGS in GDP is striking if we compare its
evolution since the respective reforms (Figure 5). Here the common area is 88 percent of the
total are and the not common area is only 12 percent of the whole.

The increase in the share of exports from the base year seems higher in India in the last
three or four years. The increase in the share of exports of goods and services was 239 percent
for China, but 283 percent for India. But this is not because of a sudden spurt at the end of the
period. The shares track well throughout the 20 year period since the respective reforms. There is
no evidence that India has depended more on domestic demand for growth while China has
depended more on exports for growth.
China is also considered to have been more successful in exports of manufactures and
India in exports of services. Bur the share of exports in GDP expressed as an index with the base
20

year of the reform having a value of 100 we get a different picture.1 We see that exports of goods
as percent of GDP have increased equally rapidly in the two countries over the entire period
(Figure 6). But they increased earlier in China and so have been usually higher in China. The
common area is only 50 percent of the total area.

However, the pattern over the period has been very different. For most of the period the
share has been much greater for China. The gap between China’s share and India’s share grew
rapidly between 1998 and 2007. It now seems to be disappearing, but because of fluctuations
there is no clear trend. Exports of goods responded more quickly to the reforms in China than in
India, as also the growth rate. Also, the large increases occurred a number of years after the start
of the reforms, so that initially domestic demand seems to have been the basis of the growth.

We take the share of exports in GDP in the first year as 100 and express the shares in
subsequent years as an index of the share in the base year.

However, the share of trade in goods in GDP has increased more in India than in China (Figure
7). This is a reflection of the deficit on goods trade that India has run whereas china has usually
had a surplus. Relative to its GDP India’s importance as a demander in the world market has
been growing when compared to China’s.

The share of exports of services (XS) in GDP (Figure 8) and in value added in the
services sector has increased more rapidly in India. The common area in share of services
exports in GDP is 53 percent.

The difference in the export performance of the two sectors does not translate into the
behavior of value added in the two sectors. Share of manufacturing value added in GDP has been
declining in both the economies and more rapidly in China (Figure 9). The common area is 87
percent. Share of value added in services has been increasing in both the economies and
surprisingly more rapidly in China (Figure 10). The common area in this case is 80 percent.

Another difference usually mentioned is that the ratio of investment to GDP has been
higher in China. Again, while this is true at the absolute level, the path of change is very similar
24

in the two economies, with the share increasing slightly more in India (Figure 11). The common
area is 92 percent.

FDI inflows are also thought to have been important in China for its manufacturing
sector and for its manufacturing exports. India has not been able to attract as much FDI, but
again the picture is more complex. For almost the first decade after the reforms were initiated in
each economy FDI as a percent of GDP behaved similarly in the two economies (Figure 12).
Then in year10 and 11 there was a surge in FDI to China. So FDI seems to have contributed little
to the initial spurt in growth.1 But since then share of FDI in GDP has fallen in China whereas it
has risen in India so the gap is again narrowing. The common area is 60 percent.

Bardhan (2010) also notes that the large increases in exports and FDI occurred later than the
growth acceleration.

Section V Concluding Remarks
Per capita GDP has grown more rapidly in China than in India; however, growth has
fluctuated more in China than in India. When we look at the behavior of 12 indicators we find
that China does better in most of them. Not only is the level higher in China, i.e., the share of
GFCF or of XGS in GDP is higher in China, but most of the indicators show lower variability in
China. But a slightly different picture emerges if we look at the dynamics of a number of
variables since the reforms. The rate of increase in exports of goods and services and of gross
fixed capital formation since the reforms has been the same in the two economies. Exports of
goods grew more rapidly in China than in India. But the more rapid growth of exports of
manufactures in China and of services in India did not translate into very different rates of
growth of the two sectors. The changes in the shares of value-added in the two sectors are very
similar with the share of services increasing slightly faster in China, but also the share of
manufacturing declining slightly faster in China.
Rapid growth of the Chinese economy and its exports has forced considerable
adjustment in other countries. It has also raised the profile of China and along with it of other
developing countries in the international economic governance system. For instance, the G8 was
not expanded to merely admit China. Initially the Heiligendamm process was initiated when
consultations were held between the G8 and 5 other large developing countries, Brazil, China,
India, Mexico and South Africa. Later after the onset of the financial crisis of 2008 the G8 was
expanded to the G20.
It is difficult to predict the future path for the Indian economy. There is the temptation
to project that the Indian economy will continue tracking the Chinese economy. In that case

27

further substantial changes will occur in the international economy. Projections suggest that the
share of the Indian economy in the world economy will increase substantially though less than
that of China (Agarwal, 2008). China had thirty years of a prosperous international economy
before the onset of the crisis of 2008. For twenty years the Indian economy has tracked well the
path of the Chinese economy. But now it is difficult to see how in the changed international
environment the Indian economy can continue to track the Chinese economy for the third decade
after reform.
