    "abstract": "\n\nRisk preferences play a fundamental role in individuals\u2019 economic decision-making. We examine whether the historical macroeconomic environment shapes individuals\u2019 willingness to take risks. Using nationally representative samples from Japan and exploiting regional variation in economic conditions, we find that men who experienced severe economic conditions in youth are more risk averse in adulthood and the effect is long-lasting. In addition, those men are less likely to be self-employed and they have longer tenure, which are consistent with elevated risk aversion. This study highlights the importance of experience at a critical period of life on the formation of risk preferences.\n\n",
