As in the neoclassical growth setting with overlapping generations studied by Tirole (1985), asset bubbles can exist in an economy with endogenous growth provided they are not too large and that the growth rate in the equilibrium without bubbles exceeds the interest rate. Since the growth rate in the bubble-less equilibrium is endogenous, the existence condition reflects parameters of tastes and technology. We find that bubbles, when they exist, retard the growth of the economy, perhaps even in the long run, and reduce the welfare of all generations born after the bubble appears.\n\n",
