    "abstract": "\n\nBusiness cycle recoveries have slowed in recent decades. This slowdown comes entirely from female employment: as women\u2019s employment rates converged towards men\u2019s over the course of the past half-century, the growth rate of female employment slowed. But does the slowdown in the growth of female employment rates translate into a slowdown for overall employment rates? The degree to which women \u201ccrowd out\u201d men in the labor market is a sufficient statistic for this question. We estimate the extent of crowding out across states, and find that it is small. We then develop a general equilibrium model of the female convergence process featuring home production and show that our cross-sectional crowding out estimate provides a powerful diagnostic statistic for aggregate crowding out. Our model implies that 60-75% of the slowdown in recent business cycle recoveries can be explained by female con-vergence.\n\n",
