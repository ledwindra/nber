Nonrenewable Resource Prices: Deterministic or Stochastic Trends?
Junsoo Lee, John A. List and Mark Strazicich
NBER Working Paper No. 11487
July 2005
JEL No. Q31, C12, C53
ABSTRACT
In this paper we examine temporal properties of eleven natural resource real price series from 18701990 by employing a Lagrangian Multiplier unit root test that allows for two endogenously
determined structural breaks with and without a quadratic trend. Contrary to previous research, we
find evidence against the unit root hypothesis for all price series. Our findings support characterizing
natural resource prices as stationary around deterministic trends with structural breaks. This result
is important in both a positive and normative sense. For example, without an appropriate
understanding of the dynamics of a time series, empirical verification of theories, forecasting, and
proper inference are potentially fruitless. More generally, we show that both pre-testing for unit
roots with breaks and allowing for breaks in the forecast model can improve forecast accuracy.

I. Introduction
An important literature has developed recently that empirically examines
nonrenewable natural resource price paths and investigates whether they are trend- or
difference-stationary. For example, Ahrens and Sharma (1997) use annual data on eleven
commodity price series ranging from 1870-1990 and conclude that six of these series are
stationary around a deterministic trend, while the remaining five display stochastic trends
implying a unit root. In a related paper, Berck and Roberts (1996) use a subset of the
same data and find overwhelming support for non-stationary unit roots. Slade (1988) and
Abgeyegbe (1993), among others, find similar overwhelming support for non-stationary
natural resource prices. A consistent theme across much of this literature is that most
natural resource prices are non-stationary.
Our motivation in this paper is to further the boundaries of econometric
methodologies and provide new insights into natural resource price time paths. Previous
empirical work on natural resource prices typically neglects possible structural change in
the time series. Since the seminal work of Perron (1989), it is well known that ignoring
structural change in unit root tests will lead to a bias against rejecting the unit root null
hypothesis when it should in fact be rejected (e.g., see also Amsler and Lee, 1995). In
this study, we advance the literature on time paths of natural resource prices by
endogenously determining structural breaks and extending the two-break Lagrangian
Multiplier (LM) unit root test of Lee and Strazicich (2003) to include a quadratic trend.
Given that a quadratic trend might exist in some natural resource price series we believe
that allowing for a quadratic trend in conjunction with structural breaks may provide
additional insights.

1

Understanding the nature of resource price time paths is important for several
reasons. Theoretically speaking, Ahrens and Sharma (1997, page 61), for example, note
that in regards to both a simple and more general Hotelling (1931) model as described in
Slade (1988), “price movement is still systematic and may be modeled appropriately as a
deterministic trend.” In contrast, in a world with uncertainty “in which speculative
motives drive the behavior of extracting firms or unanticipated events largely
characterize the market, resource prices may be generated by a random walk process”
(Ahrens and Sharma, 1997, pages 61-62). Thus, knowing the correct time series behavior
of natural resource prices can be vital to distinguish among theories that most accurately
describe observed behavior.
Knowledge of the time series properties of natural resource prices is also
important for proper econometric estimation. For example, Ahrens and Sharma (1997)
and Labson and Crompton (1993) note that conventional regression analysis and
hypothesis testing cannot be correctly undertaken without first understanding
characteristics of the time series. Otherwise, results from estimating regression models
may be rendered invalid. Several additional examples can be found in the literature (see,
e.g., Hamilton, 1996).
Finally, given that good policymaking typically depends on sound economic
forecasts, appropriately modeling the nature of the time series can be invaluable to
forecasters (Diebold and Senhadji, 1996). This task recently came to hand in Berck and
Roberts (1996), who did not consider structural breaks. They found that each commodity
price series had a unit root and hence initially paid more credence to their ARIMA
forecasts.

Berck and Roberts (1996), however, found that their ARMA forecasts

2

outperformed their ARIMA counterparts. In the later part of our paper, we investigate
whether pre-testing for unit roots with structural change can help to identify the most
accurate forecasting model. This question has not been previously examined in the
literature.
Our investigation begins by examining annual data comprised of eleven fuel and
metal real price series ranging from 1870-1990.1 After including structural breaks, we
find evidence against a unit root in each of the eleven series. We then estimate different
forecasting models and find that ARMA models with breaks generally outperform
ARIMA models with breaks, which is consistent with our pre-test expectations. These
results help to solve the puzzling results noted by Berck and Roberts (1996), and
demonstrate the importance of considering structural breaks in economic forecasting. A
second major finding is that our unit root test results are robust-with or without quadratic
trends natural resource prices are stationary around deterministic trends with two
structural breaks in intercept and trend slope. Thus, while nonlinear time trends are
important in certain price series, rejection of the underlying unit root hypothesis and
support for trend-break stationary price series does not depend on inclusion of such
trends. Finally, we find that both pre-testing for unit roots and including structural breaks
can improve the accuracy of forecasting natural resource prices.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section II provides a brief
background on unit root tests and further describes the importance of understanding the
time-series properties of exhaustible resource prices. Section III describes our empirical

In section V, we estimate a variety of forecasting models with updated data through 2002.

methodologies. Section IV presents our empirical results. In Section V, we examine
how structural breaks affect the accuracy of forecasts. Section VI concludes.

II. Background
Recent years have witnessed an explosion of research that examines the timeseries properties of economic data. An important stimulant in this time-series renaissance
was Nelson and Plosser’s (1982) study, which applied unit root analysis to test for the
stationarity of macroeconomic and financial time series. Since this seminal study, many
authors have analyzed data ranging from stock prices to air pollutant emissions, with the
bulk of research having clear implications theoretically as well as from a policy
perspective (see, e.g., List, 1999). Certainly, the empirical results from many of these
studies have broad implications in numerous areas of research.
Within the natural resource literature, Slade (1988), Berck and Roberts (1996),
and Ahrens and Sharma (1997), among others, discuss the notion that exogenous shocks
can affect the time path of natural resource prices. These studies use a variety of unit root
tests to examine time paths of commodity prices. Rejection of the unit root null supports
the alternative hypothesis of a mean or trend reverting stationary series, implying that
shock effects are transitory. Alternatively, failure to reject the unit root null implies a
non-stationary series in which shocks have permanent effects; following a shock there is
no tendency for commodity prices to revert to a stable mean or trend. The most recent of
these studies—Ahrens and Sharma (1997)—assumes one known or exogenously given
structural break common to all commodity price series in 1929, 1939, or 1945; the other
studies mentioned do not consider structural breaks.

4

Natural resource theory has stark predictions on the time pattern of resource
prices. In fact, in his treatise on the economics of exhaustible resources, Hotelling (1931)
predicts that, under certain assumptions, the price of an exhaustible resource will rise at
the rate of interest. But a quick glance at the majority of mineral commodity price series
suggests that relative commodity prices have declined, rather than increased, for long
periods of time. Barnett and Morse (1963), who observed this seemingly anomalous
pattern, concluded that scarcity was not a real problem. Although these particular results
are crucial evidence against the original premise of Hotelling, modifications of the simple
Hotelling model can produce predictions of falling or stagnant prices over time. For
example, environmental constraints and natural resource abundance may induce price
declinations (Berck and Roberts, 1996). Resource prices may also decrease when a
backstop technology is introduced, causing an inward shift in the demand for natural
resources (e.g., Heal, 1976). Technical change and an endogenous change also could
produce decreasing, or U-shaped paths for relative prices (e.g., Slade, 1982). Finally,
modifications of initial informational assumptions, such as knowledge of the original
resource stock, can induce the model to predict price decreases (see Pindyck, 1980, for
one scenario).

III. A New Modeling Approach
In this paper we begin our testing approach by employing the recently developed
two-break LM unit root test of Lee and Strazicich (2003). One important advantage of
the LM unit root test is that it is free of spurious rejections. Nunes, Newbold, and Kuan
(1997) and Lee and Strazicich (2001) showed that the endogenous break ADF-type unit

5

root tests are subject to spurious rejections in the presence of a unit root with break.2
Because these tests assume no breaks under the null and derive their critical values under
this assumption, rejection of the null need not imply rejection of a unit root per se, but
may imply rejection of a unit root without break. As such, researchers may incorrectly
conclude that a time series is (trend) stationary with break(s) when in fact the series is
non-stationary with break(s). In contrast, rejection of the null using the LM test is
unaffected by breaks. Thus, rejection of the null using the LM test unambiguously
indicates a trend-stationary series with break(s). 3
To illustrate the underlying model and LM testing procedure, we consider the
following data-generating process (DGP):
yt = δ' Zt + et

(1)

et = β et-1 + ut,

(2)

where yt is the commodity price in period t, δ is a vector of coefficients, Zt is a matrix of
exogenous variables, and ut is an error term. We define Zt = [1, t, D1t, D2t, DT1t, DT2t] to
allow for a constant term, linear time trend, and two structural breaks in level and trend,
where TBj denotes the time period of the breaks.

Under the trend-break stationary

alternative, the Djt terms describe an intercept shift in the deterministic trend, where Djt =

2

The endogenous break ADF-type unit root tests include the one-break minimum test of Zivot
and Andrews (1992) and two-break minimum test of Lumsdaine and Papell (1997). These tests
have been popular in the literature. However, as shown in Lee and Strazicich (2001, 2003), these
tests tend to estimate the break point incorrectly at one period prior to the true break(s) where bias
in estimating the unit root test coefficient is greatest. The outcome is a size distortion that
increases with the magnitude of the break. Due to a different detrending procedure in the
endogenous break LM test, this type of size distortion does not occur.
3
As is common practice in the literature, we refer to a time series that is stationary around a
breaking trend as “trend-break stationary.”

1 for t ≥ TBj + 1, j = 1, 2, and zero otherwise; DTjt describes a change in slope of the
deterministic trend, where DTjt = t for t ≥ TBj + 1, j = 1, 2, and zero otherwise.
While Berck and Roberts (1996) considered an LM unit root test with quadratic
trend, they did not consider structural breaks. Ahrens and Sharma (1997) advance the
literature by considering one structural break that is given a priori. To further advance
the literature, we consider two structural breaks that are endogenously determined by the
data. In addition, we extend the two-break LM unit root test to allow for a quadratic
trend. Defining Zt appropriately, the DGP in (1) with quadratic trend and two breaks in
intercept and trend slope can be described by Zt = [1, t, t2, D1t, D2t, DT1t, DT2t]. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first paper in any field of research to consider a
quadratic time trend in an endogenous break unit root test. 4
Test statistics for the LM unit root test are obtained from the following regression:

∼
∆yt = δ '∆Zt + φ St-1 + ut ,
∼

∼

∼

where S t = yt - ψx - Ztδ , t=2,..,T, and ψx = y1 - Z1δ . St is a detrended series of yt using the

coefficients in δ , which are estimated from the regression in first differences of ∆yt on

∆Zt = [1, ∆D1t, ∆D2t, ∆DT1t, ∆DT2t]. This procedure follows from the LM (score)
∼

principle, which imposes the null restriction. Subtracting ψx makes the detrended series

begin at zero so that S1 = 0. This detrending method based on δ differs from that adopted
in the DF type tests, where the parameter δ is estimated from the regression of yt on Zt in

There are technical difficulties in obtaining relevant asymptotic distributions and corresponding
critical values of endogenous break unit root tests with three or more breaks. However, for our
purposes, including three or more breaks does not appear necessary. First, visual inspection of
the data reveals that more than two breaks are unlikely. Second, the two-break test is found to
have sufficient ability to reject the unit root in all cases.

method is more powerful than the DF type test.

Correction for autocorrelated errors in (3) is accomplished by including augmentation

terms ∆St-j, j=1,..,k, as in the standard ADF test. To determine k we follow the “general
to specific” procedure described in Perron (1989). Beginning with a maximum number

∼

∼

of ∆St-i terms, maxk = 8, we examine the last augmented term ∆St-8 for significance at the
10% level (asymptotic normal critical value is 1.645). If insignificant, the last augmented
term is dropped from the regression and the model is re-estimated using k = 7 terms, etc.,
until the maximum lagged term is found or k = 0, at which point the procedure ends. We
repeat this procedure at each combination of two break points λ = (λ1, λ2)′ over the time
interval [.1T, .9T] (to eliminate end points).6

IV. Empirical Results

5

Note that the break locations and unit root test statistic are jointly estimated in the minimum LM
unit root test. Critical values were derived given this joint estimation (Lee and Strazicich, 2003).
6
This “general to specific” procedure has been shown to perform well as compared to other datadependent procedures in selecting the optimal number of augmented terms (see, e.g., Ng and
Perron, 1995).

Our data, generously provided by W. Ashley Ahrens and Vijaya Sharma, are
annual real price series for eleven fuels and metals. The series are typically available
from 1870-1990 and include aluminum, bituminous coal, copper, iron, lead, nickel,
petroleum, natural gas, silver, tin, and zinc.7 To allow a direct comparison with previous
research, we use commodity price series similar to those examined in Slade (1988) and
Berck and Roberts (1996), and, of course, identical to the data used in Ahrens and
Sharma (1997).8 Visual inspection of each time series in Figure 1 suggests that most are
stationary with one or two structural breaks. In a few series, there is evidence suggesting
a possible nonlinear (quadratic) trend. Curvature of trend would be consistent with
Hotelling’s basic premise. Yet, in Figure 1, the trends are not typically convex with a
positive first derivative—a majority of the figures show that relative commodity prices
have declined rather than increased. This finding matches results in previous studies and
casts doubt on some predictions of the simple Hotelling (1931) model.
Although casual inspection of Figure 1 provides some insights, formal
econometric tests are necessary to determine the properties of each time series. In our
analysis, we strive for the most general results possible. Accordingly, we employ five
different unit root tests to analyze each price series. Our first test, also employed by
Berck and Roberts (1996), is the no-break LM unit root test of Schmidt and Phillips
(1992, SP hereafter) with an added quadratic time trend. Our second test is the two-break
LM unit root test developed in Lee and Strazicich (2003). To check the robustness of our

7

Price series for aluminum, iron, and petroleum are available through 1984, 1973, and 1989,
respectively. Aluminum, gas, nickel, and tin begin in 1895, 1919, 1913, and 1885, respectively.

These data were previously converted to real prices by deflating with the producer price index
(1967 = 100). Most of the data comes originally from Manthy (1978) and Schurr (1960).

findings, and more clearly examine the effect of including two breaks instead of one, in
our third test we utilize the one-break minimum LM unit root test of Lee and Strazicich
(2004). In our most general empirical model we extend the two-break LM unit root test
to include a quadratic time trend. Finally, we extend the one-break LM test to include a
quadratic trend.

Our combination of testing procedures permits us to compare our

findings with previous studies, while simultaneously allowing us to isolate effects of
allowing for breaks.
Quadratic Trend with No Break
Results using the no-break SP LM unit root test with linear and quadratic time
trends are presented in Table 1. The second column provides sample sizes; the third
column notes the starting year; the fourth column presents the number of lagged
augmentation terms included in each regression. The resulting t-statistics testing the unit
root null hypothesis are presented in the fifth column. The rightmost column contains
summary estimation results of equation (3)—estimated coefficients of the augmented
terms are omitted to save space. Critical values are contained in the Table notes.
The test results in Table 1 suggest that five of the eleven real price series reject
the unit root null at the p < .05 level (coal, iron, lead, gas, and zinc). Interestingly, four
of these five series (all except lead) have a quadratic time trend that is significantly
different from zero at conventional levels, whereas the six series that do not reject the
unit root have insignificant quadratic time trend terms. Thus, non-rejection of a unit root
hypothesis for these six series may be due to lower power caused by including an
insignificant quadratic time trend, or to bias from omitting breaks. Consistent with
Ahrens and Sharma (1997; their Table IV), our results reject the unit root in nearly half

10

the series; but our rejections do not overlap completely. One explanation for this finding
is our inclusion of a quadratic time trend—Ahrens and Sharma (1997) do not include a
quadratic trend in their ADF tests. Ahrens and Sharma (1997) also employ the test
suggested by Ouliaris et al. (1989, OPP hereafter), which includes a quadratic time trend
but no structural break. Our results still do not exactly replicate their findings. One
possible explanation, which is noted by Ahrens and Sharma (1997), is that the OPP test is
plagued by size distortions. Fortunately, similar size distortions do not occur in the nobreak SP LM test and may help to explain the difference in results.
Comparing our results with those in Berck and Roberts (1996), which use the
same no-break SP LM test with quadratic trend, we find that inferences across the two
sets of empirical results differ significantly. Whereas we reject the unit root in five price
series, they cannot reject the unit root in any of their nine series at the 5% level. This
difference in results is most likely due to the longer time series in our tests, leading to
greater power to reject the null—whereas we make use of the entire data set, Berck and
Roberts (1996) use two smaller subsets of the data (i.e., 1940-76 and 1940-91). Using
these shorter time series, we were able to replicate the results in Berck and Roberts
(1996).

We should note that replication was achieved even though they used a

transformed test based on estimating the long-run variance, whereas we employed an
augmented version of the no-break SP LM unit root test. This provides evidence that the
difference in results is not due to different methods of correcting for autocorrelated
errors.
Two Endogenous Breaks with a Linear Trend

11

Moving to our more flexible models, we present empirical results from the twobreak LM unit root test in Table 2. Critical values are provided in the Table notes.
Empirical results may well reflect the reduction in bias from including variables to model
structural change. Compared to the no-break SP LM test results in Table 1, we find
significantly more rejections of the unit root null. Whereas the no-break model in Table
1 rejects the unit root null for five of eleven series at the p < .05 level, the two-break
model in Table 2 rejects the unit root null in eight of eleven series at p < .05. If one
considers a slightly less stringent p < .10 test, the two-break model rejects the unit root
null in all eleven series. These findings provide the strongest evidence to date against the
unit root process as a description of natural resource prices.
Our test results in Table 2 strengthen the findings of Ahrens and Sharma (1997),
and differ from the conclusions of Agbeyegbe (1993), Berck and Roberts (1996), and
Slade (1988), among others. Whereas Ahrens and Sharma (1997) allow for one known
break in 1929, 1939, or 1945 and reject the unit root in five of eight price series, after
allowing for two endogenously determined breaks we reject the unit root in all eleven
series. By including one (known) structural break Ahrens and Sharma (1997) can be seen
as an extension of Berck and Roberts (1996), while our tests can be seen as a further
extension to a more general model. 9

9

An anonymous referee notes that the shorter time span (1940-1991) examined in Berck and
Roberts (1996) can be viewed as allowing for a structural break in 1940. However, as our results
will demonstrate, while World War II is one of the major structural breaks identified by our tests,
there are other breaks that we identify. By considering a longer time span of data, our testing
procedure should benefit from greater power and a reduction in bias from including additional
breaks. It is also possible that failure to reject the unit root null in Berck and Roberts (1996)
might be due to their inclusion of a quadratic trend. If a quadratic trend does not occur, especially
in the post-1940 time period, then inclusion would lower power. We thank an anonymous referee
for noting this possibility.

12

To further examine the effect of allowing for two breaks instead of one, we
additionally test all price series using the endogenous one-break LM test. The results are
displayed in Table 3. Compared to the two-break results, we find fewer rejections of the
unit root using the one-break test (seven of eleven series reject the null at p < .05 and p <
.10). This difference in results is likely due to bias from omitting the second break
variable, and demonstrates the impact of allowing for two breaks instead of one. 10
Comparing the breaks identified by our two-break LM tests in Table 2 with those
in Ahrens and Sharma (1997), only one of our estimated break years (1945, lead)
coincides exactly with an assumed break year selected by Ahrens and Sharma (1997).
However, five additional breaks identified by our two-break tests (1928, 1932, 1942,
1943, and 1944) are close to one of their assumed breaks (1929, 1939, and 1945).
Overall, our identified break years in Table 2 are intuitively appealing as they broadly
correspond to years associated with World War I, the Great Depression, World War II,
and the energy crisis of the early 1970s.

Fifteen of the twenty-two breaks (68%)

correspond to these time periods, with the most common time period for breaks in the
early 1970s.

Besides these obvious break years, other estimated breaks occur

concurrently with important events. For example, the model shows that a structural break
occurred in 1902 for coal prices. This year coincides with the 100,000 United Mine
Worker strike that crippled coal production in the U.S. for five months.
Two Endogenous Breaks with a Quadratic Trend

10

For comparison purposes, we also performed unit root tests using the ADF-type one-break
Zivot and Andrews (1992) test and two-break Lumsdaine and Papell (1997) test. While these
tests tend to over-reject the null, their results are similar to ours. The two-break LP test rejects
the null at the 10% level for all series except for gas and petroleum. Details of these results are
available upon request.

13

In Table 4 we present results from our most general model, the two-break LM
unit root test with a quadratic time trend. Since this test is new to the literature, we
follow the procedure of Lee and Strazicich (2003) and simulate critical values, which are
presented in the Table notes.11 Compared to the two-break test results in Table 2, which
include only a linear trend, we report a few significant differences. Whereas exclusion of
the quadratic time trend in Table 2 leads to rejection of the unit root at the 10% level for
all eleven series (8 of 11 at p < .05), after including quadratic time trends, unit roots are
not rejected (at the 10% level) for aluminum and petroleum. However, the results for
aluminum should be interpreted with care, as the coefficient on the quadratic time trend is
not significantly different from zero at conventional levels, suggesting the linear time
trend specification is more appropriate. Although we find that the quadratic time trend is
significant at the 10% level in five of the eleven price series, other results are
qualitatively unchanged. Overall, at the 5% level, the results in Table 4 suggest that we
should reject the unit root in nine of the eleven series, providing additional evidence that
commodity prices are stationary around a breaking deterministic trend.
To further examine the effect of allowing for two breaks instead of one, we
additionally test all price series using an endogenous one-break LM test with quadratic

11

Since the two-break LM unit root test with quadratic trend is a new test, we derive critical
values by generating pseudo-iid N(0,1) random numbers using the Gauss (version 6.0.5) RNDNS
procedure. Critical values are derived using 5,000 replications involving a grid search of all
combinations of the endogenous break points for minimum statistics in samples of T = 100. The
asymptotic distribution of the two-break minimum LM test with quadratic trend can be shown by
a simple modification of the expression for that of the two-break minimum LM test with linear
trend. The expression of the demeaned and de-breaked Brownian bridge V
_ (r, λ) in Lee and
Strazicich (2003, equations 6c, Appendix A.6) must be changed to incorporate a detrended plevel Brownian bridge as given in SP (1992, equation 40). This expression is described as a
residual process projected onto the subspace generated by dz(λ,r) = [1, r, d1(λ1,r), d2(λ2,r)]. The
trend function is given as r = {rj, j=0,1,..,p-1}, where dj(λj,r) = 1 if r > λj, for j=1,2, and 0
otherwise.

14

trend.12 The results are displayed in Table 5. Compared to the two-break with quadratic
trend results in Table 4, we find the same number of rejections of the unit root null (nine
of eleven series reject the null at p < .05 and p < .10). The only notable difference in
results is with regards to the two series that do not reject the unit root. In Table 4
aluminum and petroleum did not reject the unit root, but in the one-break test results of
Table 5 petroleum rejects the unit root (at p < .05) while silver does not. The difference
in results for silver is likely due to bias from omitting the second break variable. The
difference for petroleum may be due to including an unnecessary break in the two-break
quadratic trend model, which would be expected to reduce power.
Again, the majority of identified break years correspond primarily to the two
World Wars, the Great Depression, and the 1970s energy crisis: fifteen of the twenty-two
breaks (68%) correspond to these time periods, with the most common time period for
breaks in the early 1970s. In addition, other important events, such as the Lead and Zinc
Stabilization Program in 1961, seem to also coincide with an identified break.
The most appropriate model in the literature to compare our results is, again,
Ahrens and Sharma’s (1997) OPP test, which allows for a quadratic trend but no
structural break(s). Using the OPP test, Ahrens and Sharma (1997) reject the unit root
null in five of eight series at p < .05. Using the two-break LM test with quadratic trend,
we reject the unit root in nine of eleven series at the 5% level. This difference is likely
due to allowing for structural breaks.
To examine further the effects of allowing for breaks, we present plots showing

series as well as fitted values from a linear time trend regression connecting the two
breaks in intercept and trend slope identified in Table 2. The plots suggest that most
price series are trend-stationary around a small number of breaks. More importantly, a
visual inspection indicates that it may be more appropriate to specify the model with
discrete shifts in a deterministic linear trend rather than a quadratic trend. Even in some
series for which a quadratic trend appears to fit, the linear trend model with two structural
breaks also appears to fit the data well.

Overall, seven of the eleven series have

downward trends in the most recent period.
In sum, the above results provide the strongest evidence to date against the unit
root hypothesis and suggest that natural resource price series are stationary around
deterministic trends with occasional changes in intercept and trend slope. Our findings
are at odds with those in previous studies. In addition, our findings strengthen those of
Ahrens and Sharma (1997), who concluded that the majority (six of eleven) of natural
resource price series reject the unit root hypothesis. In certain respects, our unit root test
results are consistent with the scores of theoretical models that suggest resource price
paths are deterministic, but downward or U-shaped. In the next section, we examine how
structural change affects forecasting.

V. Forecasting Issues
As aforementioned, we view one contribution of the above analysis as informing
the forecaster. Whether, and to what extent, structural change in natural resource prices
influences the selection and performance of forecasting models is largely unknown,
however. In this section we fill this void by exploring whether pre-testing for a unit root
with structural change and inclusion of breaks in the forecast model can lead to more

16

accurate forecasts. Diebold and Kilian (2000) previously examined whether pre-testing
for unit roots matters for forecasting, given that a priori information on the properties of a
time series is not available. The issue that we examine is similar in spirit, yet we
consider structural breaks. One may argue that allowing for breaks when pre-testing for
unit roots can give potentially different results, since a unit root process with breaks can
sometimes be viewed as observationally equivalent to, or hardly distinguishable from, a
trend stationary process with breaks. Intuitively speaking, this can be the case because
structural change implies persistent effects similar to those in a unit root process (see
Phillips, 1988). Since the pioneering work of Perron (1989), however, it is well known
that inference in unit root tests will be adversely affected by ignoring structural change.
Under the alternative hypothesis of a trend-break stationary series, structural change
would be described by occasional predetermined large shocks that permanently alter the
level and slope of the deterministic trend. This is the common view in the literature as
consistently advocated in numerous theoretical and empirical papers. Following this
view, the existence of structural change is not considered to be sufficient support for the
unit root hypothesis.
In this section, we seek to determine how structural change will affect the
selection and accuracy of forecasting models when we do not know a priori if a time
series is (trend) stationary (with breaks) or nonstationary (with breaks). Several authors
have noted the deleterious effects of ignoring structural breaks in forecasting models (see,
e.g., Pesaran and Timmermann, 2002, 2004, and Clark and McCracken, 2003). However,
these previous papers deal with mostly stationary data and do not address the question of

17

whether forecasts in levels perform better than forecasts in differences in the presence of
breaks.
We begin our investigation by conducting Monte Carlo simulations to study the
role of structural breaks in selecting and estimating the most accurate forecasting model.
To do so, we compare the unconditional prediction mean squared error (PMSE) of the
following five strategies:
(M1) Difference the data and include two breaks in intercept and trend slope.
(M2) Analyze the data in levels and include two breaks in intercept and trend slope.
(M3) Pre-test with unit root tests that allow for two breaks in intercept and trend
slope and proceed as follows: if the unit root null is rejected, then select M2; if
we cannot reject the unit root, then select M1.
(M4) Difference the data and do not allow for breaks.
(M5) Analyze the data in levels and do not allow for breaks.
Note that models M1-M3 are conditional on the existing breaks, while M4 and M5 are
not. Thus, we can compare the performance of pre-testing for a unit root in addition to
the effect of including known breaks in the forecasting model.

In general, when

comparing the accuracy of forecasts with different models the common approach is to
compare out-of-sample forecasts. We follow this approach.13

13

There does not appear to be a unanimous consensus on this issue, however. Inoue and Kilian
(2004) suggest that comparing in-sample tests of forecast accuracy are more reliable than out-ofsample tests. The underlying issue is potential data mining or un-modeled structural change.
Also, the accuracy of out-of-sample forecasts can depend on the selection of the holdout period.

18

For simplicity, we restrict our simulations to AR(1) or ARI(1,1) models as in
Diebold and Kilian (2000). Thus, M1 is an ARI(1, 1) model with two breaks and can be
described as follows:
∆yt = µ + b∆yt-1 + d1B1t + d2B 2t + d3D1t + d4D2t + vt ,

(6)

where Bjt = 1 for t = TBj + 1, j = 1, 2, and zero otherwise. M2 is an AR(1) model with
two breaks as follows:
yt = c + byt-1 + d1D1t + d2D 2t + γt+ d3DT1t + d4DT2t + wt .

(7)

M3 would be either the model in (6) or (7) depending on the results from pre-testing for a
unit root (with two breaks). M4 and M5 can be described by (6) and (7), respectively,
without the dummy variables describing the breaks. We can rewrite the DGP in (1) to be
as follows:
(yt – c – γt – d1D1t – d2D2t – d3DT1t – d4DT2t) = β(yt-1 – c – γ(t-1) – d1D1,t-1 –
d2D2,t-1 – d3DT1,t-1 – d4DT2,t-1) + ut ,

(8)

where we let c = 0, γ = 0.1, and σu2 = 1. Then, we vary the values of the persistent
parameter β as follows. To generate nonstationary data we let β = 1.0; to generate
stationary data we let β = 0.95 and β = 0.5. Another interesting question is how big
should structural breaks be to be recognized as such? We address this question by
varying the magnitude of the breaks as follows: d = (d1, d2, d3, d4) = (0, 0, 0, 0), (2, 2, 0.2,
0.2), (6, 6, 0.6, 0.6), and (10, 10, 1.0, 1.0), where d1 and d2 denote intercept shifts, and d3
and d4 denote trend slope changes, respectively. To abbreviate, we denote these different
magnitudes as d = 0, d = 2, d = 6, and d = 10, respectively, where d = 0 indicates the
model without breaks. All break sizes are described using standardized units. We
consider different break locations at ΤB1/T = 0.3 and ΤB2/T = 0.6.

19

To undertake our comparisons we examine the recursive one-step ahead
predictions of yT+h at forecast horizons h ranging from 1 to 100 periods, and employ
sample sizes T = 100 and T = 500. Pre-testing is performed using the two-break LM unit
root test and critical values at the 5% level of significance. To compare the forecast
accuracy of each model, we calculate the ratio of the prediction mean squared error
(PMSE) for each h in each model relative to the PMSE of the reference pre-test strategy
M3. The calculated ratios are denoted as M1/M3, M2/M3, M4/M3, and M5/M3. For the
models estimated in first-differences, the forecasted values are converted to levels prior
to calculating their mean squared error. The forecast error is calculated as the difference
^
between the (simulated) data and the predicted values (in levels), or yT+h - yT+h , h =
h
1,…,100. Thus, PMSE(h) = h-1 ∑ (yT+j - y^T+j)2 using forecast errors through t = h. When
j=1

the selected forecasting model is more accurate than the model suggested by pre-testing,
then the ratio will be less than one and vice versa. For parsimony, we report only the
summary results for selected values of h.
We first examine the simulation results using nonstationary data (β = 1.0) in
Table 6. When the DGP is nonstationary, the differencing strategy of M1 (ARI with
breaks) has the lowest PMSE in nearly all cases. There are only very small differences in
some cases. In nearly all cases the best model (M1) is also the model that is selected by
the pre-testing. Any differences are approximately zero, and the results are unaffected by
the size of the breaks or the sample size. Overall, these results clearly support the use of
pre-testing for a unit root and including structural breaks. For the case of no breaks there
is a small gain from omitting the breaks in the (differenced) forecasting model (M4). For
the case of small breaks (d = 2), the results demonstrate little difference between

20

including breaks (M1) and omitting breaks (M4). Thus, as one might expect, small
breaks have only minimal effects on the PMSE and can be hardly considered as structural
breaks. However, as the size of the breaks increases the benefit of including breaks
increases especially at longer forecast horizons.
We next examine the simulation results using stationary data in Table 6. When
the DGP is clearly stationary (β = 0.5), the model in levels with breaks (M2) is superior
in virtually all cases. Any differences are so small that they are approximately zero and
can be ignored. In addition, M2 is the model that is selected with pre-testing in nearly
every case. Again, any differences are quite small, and the results are unaffected by the
break size, forecast horizon, and sample size. When β = 0.95 and the unit root null is
more difficult to reject, the most accurate forecasting model is in differences (M1) instead
of levels (M2). However, the difference model is also the model most frequently selected
by pre-testing. Thus, pre-testing for a unit root (with breaks) is again the preferred
method to select the most accurate forecasting model. As in the nonstationary case,
including breaks when they exist is always beneficial. Figures 2 and 3 summarize the
simulation results by displaying spectrum with varying sample sizes of T = 20n, n =
1,..,50, over the continuum of forecasting horizons h = 1,..,100. These figures generalize
the results in Table 6 and are consistent with the above discussion.
To further our investigation, we next examine and compare the accuracy of the
different forecasting strategies by using actual data on natural resource prices.

To

perform our investigation, we utilize more recent data on eight natural resource real
prices (aluminum, copper, iron, lead, nickel, silver, tin, and zinc). These data come from

21

the U.S. Geological Survey (Kelly et al., 2005), and are available annually from 19002002 in real (1998) dollars per ton.14
Our testing procedure is as follows. We first perform pre-testing for each real
price series as before using the two-break LM unit root test with linear trend. In nearly
all cases (except for nickel), the unit root null is rejected at the 10% level of significance.
We also perform pre-testing using the two-break LM unit root test with quadratic trend
and reject the unit root in all cases at the 10% level of significance. 15 Next, we estimate
four forecasting models for each series with a linear trend as in (6) and (7) (M1, M2, M4,
and M5), and then with a quadratic trend (M1Q, M2Q, M4Q, and M5Q).
Instead of the AR(1) and ARI(1, 1) models (with and without breaks) considered
in the simulations of Table 6, we consider more general ARMA(p,q) models and
ARIMA(p,1,q) models that might be more realistically considered in applications. To
determine the order p and q of each ARMA and ARIMA model, and the location of two
breaks, we utilize the SBC statistic. We consider all combinations of p and q over the
range 0 to 5 at each combination of two breaks to find the model with the lowest SBC.
As such, our estimation procedure allows for the location of breaks to be jointly
determined with the best fitting model. In each case, we estimate the forecasting model
using data from 1900-1990 and generate out-of-sample forecasts in levels for 1991-

14

We would have preferred to update our data, but the new data uses a different PPI to deflate the
data and different units of measurement. And, the new data is only available for eight of our
previous eleven natural resource price series. However, besides using more recent data (past
1990), the new data has the advantage that each series is available for the same time period
(1990-2002).
15
These results are available upon request.

22

2002.16 Then, the out-of-sample forecasts are compared to the actual data to calculate the
relevant PMSE. To test the statistical significance of the break variables in the models
that include breaks, F-tests were performed to test for the significance of the breaks. In
each case, the null hypothesis that break coefficients are jointly equal to zero was rejected
at the 1% level of significance. These results provide additional evidence that structural
breaks are important.
The PMSE are displayed in Table 7 for each model type at forecast horizons h = 1,
3, 5, 8, and 12. The number in bold denotes the model with the most accurate forecasts
(smallest PMSE), which is shown separately for the models with linear and quadratic
trends. At each forecast horizon (h), the best overall model is denoted with an asterisk
(*). Given that pre-testing implied that price series are trend-break stationary, we expect
that M2 (ARMA model in levels with breaks) will have the lowest PMSE in nearly all
cases.
We now examine the results in Table 7. Except for tin, and to a lesser extent iron,
we see little evidence that including a quadratic trend improves the accuracy of the
forecast, as the best model has a linear trend in all other cases. For aluminum, copper,
and lead our pre-test expectations are realized as the most accurate model in every case
but one (lead, h =1) is the ARMA model in levels with breaks (M2). While iron selects
the quadratic trend model at three of the five forecast horizons, three of its five best
models are in levels with breaks (M2, M2Q) as suggested by the pre-test. For the other
four price series the results are mixed. In all cases but one (h = 1), the best forecasting

16

As noted in footnote 14, the out-of-sample PMSE results might vary depending on how we
define the out-of-sample period. We also considered 1996 as a starting period for the out-ofsample forecasts, but the main conclusions did not vary.

23

model for nickel is the ARMA model in levels without breaks (M5). For silver, the
results are unexpected as four of the five best models are in differences (M1, M4), and
three of these are without breaks (M4). Tin is the series where the quadratic trend model
is most often selected (four of five best models). Although including a quadratic trend
provides better forecasting accuracy for tin, the best model chosen in all cases is in
differences and without breaks (M4, M4Q). Finally, zinc selects an ARMA model in
levels in all cases as predicted by pre-testing, but the best model is without breaks (M5).
Overall, the results in Table 7 using actual natural resource data present a less
clear picture than our simulation results in Table 6. However, as expected, the most
consistently selected model is the same as selected in the pre-test; in four of the eight
series the ARMA model with breaks (M2 or M2Q) is the most accurate in nearly all cases.
For the other four series the results are less clear. In some of these cases, the best model
is in levels as expected, but without breaks. In other cases the superior model is in
differences. Thus, while the model selected by pre-testing is not always the best model it
appears that pre-testing for a unit root and considering breaks are important. The gain
from considering breaks is most obvious when comparing the PMSE of those superior
models that include breaks to the other models.
In general, as is well known, forecasting future values out-of-sample is a difficult
task. Therefore, it may not be desirable to draw any generalized conclusions regarding
forecasting strategies from a particular data application to a particular out-of-sample
period. Choosing different data and different out-of-sample periods may lead to different
conclusions. Thus, we give stronger credence to our simulation results as a guide to more

24

accurate forecasting. We conclude that it is better to follow a forecasting strategy of pretesting for a unit root with breaks and including existing breaks in the forecast model.

VI. Concluding Remarks
Without an appropriate understanding of the dynamics of a time series, empirical
verification of theories, forecasting, and proper inference are potentially misleading. In
this paper we examine temporal properties of eleven nonrenewable natural resource real
price series from 1870-1990.

Previous efforts largely suggest that these series are

difference-stationary with stochastic trends. We re-examine these data and advance the
literature by considering unit root tests with two structural breaks that are endogenously
determined by the data. In addition, we consider models with linear and quadratic trends.
Overall, we find evidence to indicate that natural resource prices are stationary
around deterministic trends with structural breaks in intercept and trend slope.

In

particular, after controlling for breaks, the previous empirical findings of Agbeyegbe
(1993), Berck and Roberts (1996), and Slade (1988) are essentially reversed.

Our

findings strengthen those of Ahrens and Sharma (1997), who allowed for one known
break and concluded that the majority of natural resource price series (six of eleven)
reject the unit root. Following our unit root tests, we examined forecasting models with
breaks by employing both simulations and actual natural resource price data. From our
simulations, we conclude that it is better to pre-test for a unit root (with breaks) prior to
selecting the best forecast model, and to include breaks, if they exist, in all cases. While
our forecasting results with actual data are less clear than our simulations, the most
consistently selected model is the same as selected in the pre-test.

25

Given that accurate forecasting and empirical verification of theories can depend
critically on understanding the appropriate nature of time-series, our results should have
important implications for academics and policymakers alike. With the proliferation of
environmental and natural resource data having a temporal dimension, researchers
interested in dynamic issues as broad as environmental quality expenditures,
environmental degradation, species extinction rates, and land-use patterns should have a
firm grounding in time-series analysis.

We hope that our paper will further the

development of this literature.

Notes: Critical values of the two-break LM test with structural breaks in level and trend vary depending on the location of breaks (λ). Critical values are shown at the 1%,
5%, and 10% levels, respectively, for samples of size T = 100. Critical values are –6.16, –5.59, and –5.28 for λ = (.2,.4); –6.40, –5.74, and –5.32 for λ = (.2,.6); –6.33, –
5.71, and –5.33 for λ = (.2,.8); –6.46, –5.67, and –5.31 for λ = (.4,.6); –6.42, –5.65, and –5.32 for λ = (.4,.8); –6.32, –5.73, and –5.32 for λ = (.6,.8), where λ indicates the
relative location of the breaks. Other critical values can be interpolated. The critical values are symmetric around λ1 and λ2. B1t, B2t and D1t, D2t correspond to changes in
intercept and trend slope under the alternative, respectively. B1t and B2t denote one-period jumps in level and^ D1t and D2t correspond to changes in drift under the null
hypothesis, respectively. Note that the constant term corresponds to a linear trend in Zt under the alternative. k denotes the estimated optimal number of first-differenced
lagged terms included to correct for serial correlation. t-statistics are shown in parentheses. a: See notes in Table 1. * and ** denote significant at the 10% and 5% levels,

Notes: PMSE is the predicted mean squared error of the post-1990 out-of-sample forecast period (h). M1 =
differences with breaks, M2 = levels with breaks, M4 = differences without breaks, M5 = levels without
breaks, and Q denotes that the model includes a quadratic trend instead of linear trend. Structural breaks
were jointly significant in all models that included breaks at p < 0.01. * denotes the model with the lowest
PMSE.
