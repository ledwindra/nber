ECONOMIC THEORIES OF FERTILITY:
WHAT DO THEY EXPLAIN?

•

by
Warren C. Sanderson
Stanford University

The economic theory of fertility, in its current state,

is a product of two broad strands of influence. One such strand can
be found in the works of Becker,1 Mincer2 and Willis.3 The other

strand winds its way through the works of Eastr1in.4 The Becker— and
Easterlin—type approaches are fundamentally quite distinct, not in the

least part because of the differences in what the authors try to

accomplish. The main thrust of Becker's work (and that of his followers)
is to show how economic models may be used to aid our understanding of

fertility variations and differentials. The spirit of the Becker—type
analysis, is the spirit of the economic theorist who is demonstrating
the strength and breadth of the analytical framework by showing how it

may be used to analyze a complex and unresolved problem. Easterlin came
to the study of fertility with a quite different background, that of an

economic historian. The problem for Easterlin was to understand fertility
variations within a historical context. Thus, for Easterlin, the main
problem was to provide a framework in which to comprehend the available

information on the variations in fertility over time. The spirit of the
Easterlin—type analysis is the spirit of the economic historian who finds
•

himself compelled to modify economic models and concepts for the purpose

of understanding some observed behavior. Of course, there is much in
common between these two approaches.

I

—2—

One problem which is shared by both approaches to the
economics of fertility is how to account for the inverse relationships

between fertility and income which are so frequently observed.5 If
the relationships were always negative there would be some temptation
to label children as "inferior goods", but in reality the relationships

vary in sign.6 Furthermore, treating children as If they were inferior
goods does not explain observed behavior, but rather just gives it a name

after the fact. So economists have shied away from assuming that children
could be viewed as inferior goods and have regarded the negative associations
between income, and fertility as something which must be explained in other

terms. Thus all the models of fertility discussed below have some mechanism which can transform a nominally positive association between income
and fertility into a negative one.

The Economic Theory of Fertility Before Becker: Leibenstein
Becker is usually considered the father of the contemporary
economic theory of fertility although his work was not the first to
analyze the demand for children within the framework economic theory.
His work was predated at least by the contributions of Leibenstein7 and

Okun.8 What differentiated Becker's work from that of Leibenstein's
and Okun's was Becker's use of the well known demand theory approach
to the problem of fertility without the introduction of ad hoc or unfamiliar
notions into the structure of model in order to explain the possibility
of a negative relationship between icnome and fertility.

The essence of Leibenstein's contribution is presented in the

following

quotation.

S

—3—
Our central notion is that people behave in the same
way as they would if they applied rough calculations to the
problem of determining the number of births they desire.
And such calculations would depend on balancing the satisfactions or utilities to be derived from an additional birth
as against the "cost," both monetary and psychological,
of having an additional child. We distinguish among three
types of utility to be derived from an additional birth
and two types of cost. The types of utility are: (1) the
utility to be derived from the child as a 'consumption
good,' namely, as a source of personal pleasure to the parents;
(2) the utility to be derived from the child as a productive
some point the child may be expected to
agent, that is,
enter the labor force and contribute to family income; and

at

(3) the utility derived from the prospective child as a
potential source of security, either in old age or otherwise.
The costs of having an additional child can be divided
into direct and indirect costs. By direct costs we refer
to the conventional current expenses of maintaining the
child, such as feeding and clothing him at conventional
standards until the point is reached when the child is self—
supporting. By indirect costs we refer to the opportunities
foregone due to the existence of an additional child. These
are represented by such lost opportunities as the inability

of mothers to work if they must tend to children, lost
earnings during the gestation period, or the lessened mobility
of parents with large family responsibilities.9

Many of the ideas subsequently developed in the economic theory

of fertility can be found in Leibenstein's work. Indeed, those paragraphs suggest at least one line of approach which has not yet been

explored. Leibenstein's main interest in fertility in his 1957 volume,
was why fertility declined as per capita income rose. He summarized
his argument on this score in the following figure.

I

—4—

.

Figure 1

.

—5—
In the Leibenstein model fertility fell as per capita income

rose for two main reasons. First, as per capita income increases there
are associated changes in the structure of economic activities which

tend to reduce the value of children to their parents. Leibenstein
suggests that the main causes of this decline are the decreasing utility
of children of a given order in providing old—age security for their

parents and the decreasing potential of children contributing to family

income through work activities. On the other side of the coin, Leibenstein
views the costs of children of a given order as increasing as per capita
income increases because tithe style in which a child is maintained

depends on the position and income of the parents." Leibenstein also
thought that the indirect costs of children of a given order would rise

because he considered "opportunities for (parents) engaging in productive
or in various time—consuming activities as likely to grow as income
increases .

Leibenstein's

analysis is focused on explaining variations

in fertility over time. It suggests that students of fertility pay
attention to two broad sets of forces in determining fertility movements.
The first is the set of structural transformations which accompany the
rIse in per capita income and which (according to Leibenstein) decrease

the value of children to their parents. The second is a set of forces
which increases the cost of children as income increases. Thus, the
Leibenstein model differs from a simple model of constrained optimization in that par capita income affects fertility through a variety of

mechanisms in addition to its effect on the budget constraint. Leibenstein
solved the problem of explaining the negative secular relationship
between income and fertility by positing that the utility function

—6—
shifts

•)
with changes in per capita income and that the price of children

varies with family income. In the Leibenstein model secular increases
in income are associated with changes in tastes and changes in the
relative price of children which dominate the pro—natal effect of income

increases and cause the observed negative relationship. I think it
is fair to say that the Leibenstein model represented, in somewhat

more

in

formal terms, the main lines explanation of the secular decline

fertility which were widely accepted at the time

of his writing.

An Explanation of FluctuationS in American Fertility: The Work of Easterlin
Like Leibenstein's ideas, the main focus of Easterlin's

work has been on fertility variations over time. Easterlin has made
a number of contributions to the economic analysis of fertility12,

but in this chapter we shall

be eclectic and

treat only those which

to the present discussion. Whereas Leibenstein

considered the problem of fertility variations in the context of
developing countries, the works of Easterlin, which will be discussed
here, deal with fertility fluctuations over time in the United States.
In 1961, Easterlin proposed an explanation

for

the American baby boom13

which suggested that the baby boom was a manifestation of the same sort
of forces which, in an earlier era, had produced long swings in migration.
In 1966, Easterlin suggested an integrated explanation of both the baby
boom and the following fertility decline.14
In the earlier article, Easterlin focused on the time profile
of white fertility which he disaggregated into the time paths of the
fertility of foreign—born whites, rural native whites, and urban native

—7—

)

white.

He found through this process, that most of the temporal decline

in fertility in white fertility in the United States was due to the
declining fertility of foreign—born whites, the declining fertility of

rural native whites, and the rural—urban shift. The fertility of urban
native whites decreased only slightly from 1885—89 to 1925—29. After
1925—29, however, urban white fertility shows a marked alteration from

its relative constancy of the previous 40 years. The great depression
caused a substantial decrease in fertility and the postwar period,
through to the middle '50s, saw an unprecendented fertility increase.

Easterlin suggests a separate explanation for the fertility

patterns of each of the three groups. For our present purposes it is
sufficient to examine his explanation of the course of urban native

fertility. In order to explain these fertility changes Easterlin concentrates
on the fertility of young people. Easterlin's explanation of changes
in the fertility of urban native whites hinges on the interaction of two

factors: changes in the aggregate unemployment rate and

rate

changes

in the

of growth of the total white male population 20—29. Both increases

in the aggregate unemployment rate and the rate of growth of the total
white

male population are thought to be negatively associated with

fertility changes. The changes in these two

factors

broadly reflect changes in the economic well—being

associated before the Great Depression. This inverse relationship
is caused by a negative association between the unemployment rate in the

United States and international migration to the United States.15
According to Easterlin, the rapid response of migration to changes in
labor market conditions which prevented pronounced cyclical movements
in the economic well—being of young adults was the reason for the relative
constancy of urban native white fertility before the Depression of the

1930's. After the statutory restriction of international migration in
the early 1920's the stage was set for the native white population to bear

the full brunt of economic fluctuations. In
particular, the baby boom period of the 'fifties was a period of relatively
low unemployment rates and a relatively low growth rate of the white

male population 20—29 because of the low fertility in the 1930's. The
combination of these two circumstances was unusual and Easterlin suggested
that it was this fortuitous combination which caused the baby boom.
In his later article on the baby boom, Easterlin added another

element to his explanation of fertility changes. Easterlin argued that
it was incorrect to create economic models of fertility based on the

assumption that tastes remained fixed. He argued that young adults
become acquainted with a certain level of consumption when they are
teenagers in their parents' households and that this level of consumption

p

Thus,

Easterlin

—9—

I)
suggests not only that we study changed in the economic position of
young people in order to understand changes in fertility, but that we
also study changes in their economic position relative to that of their
parents.

Easter].in presented a table to support the intergenerational

relative income hypothesis, which showed the relationship between
median family incomes of families whose heads were 14—24 in a given
year with those of families whose heads were 35—44 five years earlier.

Th table contained data for the years 1953—1962. Table 1 shows similar
data for the years 1953—1972 and these data together with the

age specific

fertility rates of married women 15—19 and 20—24 lagged one year are
plotted in Figure 3A.

The peak of the income ratio is in 1956 and the ratio declines

rapidly to a local trough in 1963. The two years of marked increase
which follow 1963 give way to a continued decline through 1972. Thus,
at first glance, the income ratio series does not seem to do well in

explaining the fertility of young women. While both the lagged age—
specific marital fertility rates and the income ratios have local peaks
in 1956, the income ratio declines through 1963, while the lagged age—
specific martial fertility rate for women 15—19 is higher in 1960 than

in 1957 and the rate for women 20—24 is higher in 1959 than in 1957. After
1963, the three series hardly seem related at all. In Figure 3—B, the
intergenerational relative income ratio and the marriage rate for un-

married women 15—44 are plotted. It can be seen from that figure that
the marriage rate and the income ratio are quite closely related. Indeed,

.

I

apparently

they are more closely related than the income ratio and

age—specific fertility rates. However, the relationship between the
income ratio and the marriage rate is not so close as to obviate the

need for further discussion. This is not the place for a complete
test of the intergenerational relative income hypothesis. Here we
simply want to suggest the possibility that, to the extent that inter-

generational relative Income Is an important determinant of fertility,
its impact is chiefly through its influence on marriage rates and only
secondarily through it influence on the completed fertility of married
women.

It would be quite naive to believe that all fertility

variations could be understood with reference to a single income ratio

I

and this Is not what Easterlin intended. For one thing, contraceptive
technology was changing rapidly in the '60's and this could possibly

account for some of the deviations between the income ratio series
and the lagged age—specific marital fertility series in the middle of

the decade. A balanced view of the matter would suggest that the intergenerational relative income effect may be quite important in understanding fertility changes, but that a definitive test of that hypothesis has not yet been made.

Easterlin,

like Leibenstein, views tastes as changing in an

antinatal direction as income increases. At first glance, this might
seem to be a noneconomic explanation of fertility variation.

Becker's Economic Theory of Fertility: Leibenstein Formalized?
In 1960, Becker formally applied demand theory to task of

understanding fertility.17 The model suggested by Becker dealt with a
single consumer and

may be written as follows:

and

the Becker model the utility function is defined

over the number of children, the average real expenditures per child, and

the quantity of everything else. The distinction between

and e

— 12 —

is

very Important for Becker's argument. He notes that it is quite

plausible that increases in income are associated with increases in the
average real expenditures per child, but that this does not by itself

indicate that the cost of children rises with Income. Becker wrote:
A change in the cost of children Is a change in the cost
of children of given quality, perhaps due to a change in the
price of food or education. . . One would not say that the price
of cars has risen over time merely because more people now buy
Cadillacs and other expensive cars. A change in price has to
be estimated from indexes of the price of a given quality.
Secular changes in real income and other variables have
induced a secular increase in expenditures on children, often
interpreted as a rise in the cost of children. The cost of
children may well have risen . . . but the increase in expenditure on children is no evidence of such rise since the quality
of children has risen. Today children are better fed, housed,
and clothed, and in increasing numbers are sent to nursery schools,
camps, high schools, and colleges. For the same reason, the
price of children to rich parents is the same as that to poor
parents even though rich parents spend more on children. The
rich simply choose higher quality children as well as higher

qualities of other goods.
Armed with the distinction between cost and expenditure, Becker
attacked Lelbenstein and others for assuming that the cost of children

necessarily rose with income. He argued that it was preferable to make
an

analogy between children and

.

— 13 —

Becker's

distinction between expenditure and

cost was quite

persuasive and for 13 years after Becker's initital article on fertility
most economists working in the field were convinced that "the price of
children to rich parents is the same as that to poor parents even though
rich parents spend more on children.

20
However, in 1973, Becker and Lewis

discovered that this statement waä an obiter dictum and not a true impli-

cation of the Becker modal. Indeed, income changes generally produced
endogeneous relative price changes in that model whose effects had not

been previously analyzed. In analyzing these induced relative price changes
Becker and Lewis found that Becker had been wrong in his earlier article.
They wrote:

This price effect, however, does offer a correction to
the argument advanced by Becker (1960), and followed by many
others, that the price of children is the same for the rich as
for the poor (aside from the cost—of—time argument), even
though the rich choose more expensive children. The relevant
price of children with respect to their number is higher for
the. rich precisely because they choose more expensive children.
Similarly, the relevant price of cars, houses, or other goods
is higher r the rich because they choose more expensive
varieties.

In some regrds the Becker—Lewis article in 1973 brings us
full circle to Leibenstein's 1957 arguments, albeit with a considerable

increase in the level of analytic sophistication. Nonetheless, the
initial Becker article still has some appeal and it is difficult to
accept the proposition that the prices of goods are higher for the wealthy
than for the poor just because the wealthy purchase higher quality goods.

Are the price of automobiles, houses, children and other goods really

higher for the rich thai for the poor? In order to discuss this question
let us consider two alternative models.

that in the second model the real expenditure of each child

is treated as a separate argument in the utility function. In Beker's
model these arguments are aggregated together into the number of children,

and the average real expenditure per child. Thus,
parents are assumed to be indifferent between the sItuation in which they
have two children with a real expenditure of $10,000 on the first and $2
on the second and the situation in which the parents have two children with

a real expenditure of $5,001 on each of them. No such assumption is made
in Model II. Neither of these models has any implications for the number
of children or real expenditures on them as it is written. In order to

— 15

derive some implications it is

customary to assume that all the arguments

in the utility functions are normal goods.23 With these additional
assumptions in mind let us consider the Becker model first.
It can be seen immediately that the Becker model is not the

standard model of demand theory. There are several very importmnt

differences. First of all, the arguments of a utility function are
generally quantities of goods and services. In the Becker model, n

and s meet this criteria, but e does not because it represents an
average of quantities, the average being taken over another argument in

This

the utility function.

specification leads to the other important

departure from the standard model; the budget constraint is not linear

in the arguments of the utility function. The consequences of these
differences can be seen most clearly when the first—order conditions for

a utility maximum are written down. They are

Now int sense is it true that children are more expensive

the case, e (2)

25

The complications caused by the induced relative price effects

in

the Becker model contrast markedly with the simplicity of the analysis

of Model II, the model in which each child is treated separately.
Model II is formally identical to the standard model of demand theory and
therefore the first—order conditions for a maximum are:

and where n is the number of children in the family. In Model II
shadow prices are fixed parameters independent of income. Therefore, the

shadow prices are the same to rich and poor alike. There is no sense
in which the price of children or automobiles or houses, for that matter,
varies with income in this model.

Thus, it is the standard demand model which yields the assertion
that prices are invariant to income, whereas the original Becker model
itself leads to the Leibensteinian position taken on this question in the

Becker—Lewis 1973 article. Clearly, whether or not the price of children
varies with income depends upon the model chosen to represent the
decision—making process. The same is certainly true for houses, automobiles,
and other goods.

Now that there are two models proposed to explicate the same

phenomena, the question naturally arises: which model is preferable?
For those who would resolve this question by an empirical test
of the implications of the models, the absence of any testable implications

from the Becker model poses something of a problem. The Becker model
can accomodate virtually any fertility—income pattern, but it predicts

no particular association. Becker and Lewis have shown that even though
n

and e

are

assumed to be normal goods,

their observed elasticities

with respect to income may be negative. This can be seen in

Figure 4,

where we have assumed that utility is initially maximized at the point

that figure the constraint K1K1 and the indifference curve U1U1

are both drawn holding the quantity of s consumed at s .

Similarly

the constraint K2K2 and the indifference curve U2U2 are both drawn

holding the quantity of s consumed at s (3)
Figure 4 illustrates the case where fertility decreases with

income even though n is a normal good in the utility function. The
initial point which maximizes utility is at a2 ,

the

point where

the budget constraint K1K1 and the indifference curve U11J1 are

the increase in

income in that representation causes fertility to decline. Nonetheless,

n

not an inferior good. In order to show this, consider the straight

In

addition to having no implications for the relationship

between income and

fertility,

the Becker model also has no implications

for the effects of market price changes on fertility. Changing p9
has a pure cross—substitution effect26 on n of unknown sign which is now
compounded

by an income effect

equivalent to

of unknown sign.

Decreasing p i

increasing income and increasing PS

but since both of

the latter two changes result in ambiguous changes In n , even decreasing
has no clear effect on fertility in the Becker model.27 Therefore,
since the Becker model has no implications for fertility it cannot

easily be falsified by observed data. Rather than providing implications
concerning fertility the Becker model provides a framework for the
analysis of fertility into which practically all observed data can fit.
There is one particularly interesting subtelty of the Becker
(1960) model that, as Becker and Lewis (1973) have shown, deserves

attention. In the context of the Becker mod.i,
the ordering of the observed income elasticities of demand for n and
e may be the reverse of the ordering of the true income elasticities

of demand for n and e

Thus, we might observe that the income

elasticity of demand for e is greater than the income elasticity

of demand for n ,

but

nonetheless it may be the case that the true

As a framework for the analysis, the Becker model tells its
user that he cannot
and

market

learn much

about fertility from

simply

studying income

prices. In order to understand even the direction in which

fertility responds to an economic change, the Becker model requires

quite a bit of information about the individuaTh tastes. Thus, the
framework of analysis suggested by Becker and Lewis is one in which
the differences in the structures of individuals' taste patterns are
crucial to an understanding of fertility differentials.

In contrast to the Becker model, in Model II Lhere are implications

for fertility of changes ir economic variables. The implications are

1. increasing (decreasing) income never causes fertility
to fall (rise) and may cause it to rise (fall).

2. decreasing (increasing) p never causes fertility to
fall (rise) and may cause it to rise (fall).

3. decreasing (increasing)

p5 may cause fertility

either to rise or fall.

The first implication may be easily demonstrated. Let us suppose at some

In Figure 5, at income level aa , the family chooses not to have any

children, i.e., e1=O . However, increasing income to bb induces the
family to have their first child and e1 becomes positive.
A similar diagram can be used to illustrate
cation. When p
on

the

second impli-

decreases fertility cannot fall because more is spent

each. existing child, but fertility may rise. This is shown in Fig. 6

again for the case where the family initially has no children. Given

the constraint aa ,

the constraint shifts to ba ,

family is induced to have their

first child and e1 becomes positive. A decrease in p5 is equivalent
to an increase in income and an increase

in p c

The

increase in

income taken by itself could have a positive effect on fertility and

the increase in PC

taken by itself could have a negative ffect

on fertility and it is impossible to determine a priori which of the

two effects would dominate. Therefore, the effect of a change in p5
on

fertility

is indeterininant.

that although n ,

this

added ambiguity in the Becker model concerning the effect of observed

income changes on fertility is a point in its favor because observed
fertility variations have indeed been both positively and negatively

associated with income. But some caution is suggested here. Any associations may be rationalized within a framework which does not restrict the

direction or magnitude of association. This is one reason economists have
chosen to assume children are not an inferior good and have reasoned,
therefore, that children ought to be treated in our models as if they were

consumer durables. If the Becker model of quantity—quality interaction
is appropriate for both children and consumer durables, then why do we
often observe negative income elasticities of ttdemandt for children,

whereas in the case of consumer durables positive observed income elas-

ticities are almost invariably observed. Within the context of the model
the answer could only be that tastes for children are really different

from tastes for durables. While this answer is better than no answer,
there will be those who would argue that the same answer could have
obtained without a model of quanity—quality interaction.
Before completing the. comparison of the Becker model with the

standard demand theory model of fertility, there are a few minor points

to be mentioned. In the Becker model, given fixed money income and fixed

prices, PC and p

,

the values of n , e

,

and s which maximize

the utiliity function need not be unique. This is shown in Figure 7.
In that figure it is assumed that utility is mazimized when the quantity
of

s is consumed and that assumption underlies the drawing of

another minor point is that in the Becker model

quality

there is a

dimension in only one of the two goods, children. Adding a

quality dimension to the other good complicates the model considerably and
weakens whatever hope. there was

of

ever putting the Becker model to

an empirical test.28 Another aspect of the Becker model is that, although

both

n and e are asstmied to be normal goods,

even their product,

27 —

I
total real expenditures on children (cne)

, need

not be normal with

respect to observed income changes. It is possible, in the Becker model,

for total real expenditures on children to decrease with an increase
in income29 while in Model II total real expenditures on children must
increase when income increases.

In

the end, the a priori choice between the Becker model and

the alternative model boils down to the question of how relevant one
believes the form of quality—quantity interaction (specified in the

Becker model) to be in the case of fertility decisions. Model II,
where relative prices do not change with income, is certainly easier to
analyze and manipulate, but it treats each child as a separate entity

just like each item in the household's consumption basket. Model II,
which is, in fact, the standard demand theory model, thus fails to
reflect certain sociological or psychological constraints upon the
freedom of a family to select a "consumption mix."
Ironically in capturing the influence of such constraints upon fertility decisions, the Becker model comes closer
siderations which underlay Leibenstein's

to recognizing the range of con-

treatment of fertility. One source of

quantity—quality interaction, for example, may lie in parents' desire

to make the same real expenditures on each child. In today's environment in

the United States of small families in which the children are

relatively

closely spaced, it seems plausible to believe that real

expenditures per child do not differ much across children in the

same family. This would perhaps justify treating the average real
expenditure per child as a separate argument of the utility function ——

28it would be an index of the family's (uniform) child—rearing style.
Taking a more historical view, however, there seems to be reasons to
doubt that expenditures per child were equalized across children in

the family. Inheritance practices, of course, varied across time and
space, but it was not unusual for a farm to be divided unequally between

a farmer's heirs.3° In the United States earlier in this century it
was not uncommon for some children of the family to be sent to work
so that other children (brothers, usually) could be sent to school.3'
Therefore, it is not clear that observed regularities in behavior at
one time are most usefully treated as sociological or psychological

constraints operating on utility functions for all times. If there
is a modern social convention which influences parents to spend equally
on each child, it certainly owes much to the small size of the modern

family. To accept the convention as operating at all times can add
an element to circularity to any explanation of the decline in fertility

over time. An appropriate historical model should be able to account
for diversity in expenditures per child and the possible convergence

of these expenditures over time. In this regard, Model II, being more
general, must be judged to be preferable to the Becker model as a framework for analysis.

The Household_Viewed as a Production Structure: The Willis Model of
Fertility Decisions
The analysis of household fertility decisions recently advanced
32
by Willis
represents the combination and development of two

lines

of

— 29 —

approach, both suggested by Becker. The result

is

the most sophisticated

and powerful model of fertility choice generally known to economists.
Willis combined the Becker model of fertility discussed abgve with the
concepts of household production and time allocation pioneered by Muth33

and Becker.34 The two

threads,

however, can exist separately or in

combination with other strands of thought. Becker and Lewis35 have
shown that it is possible to analyze quantity—quality interactions in
the Becker model without considering the structure of household pro-

duction and below it will be shown that the structure of household
production may

be

usefully placed in a model without the specific form

of quantity—quality interaction envisioned in the Becker model.

36

A few words of comment are necessary here. Clearly, the Willis

model is not a complete model of fertility in the sense that there are
many plausible additions wich might still be introduced, even though as
it stands it constitutes a significant elaboration of the original Becker

model. For the purpose of creating models which have analytic implicadons, it is certainly important to abstract from all but the most important aspects of the problem, but this does not mean that the specification

of the model is beyond question. Rather than probing the model for those
assumptions which are crucial and for those which are not, let us proceed
to a brief discussion of the model's properties.

After the model has

been put through its paces we shall return to the question of whether

— 31 —

p

it would have performed any differently had its assumptions been
altered.

At first glance the only portion of the Willis model which

resembles the Becker model is the utility function. However, their
similarities run

considerably

deeper. Since C and H are homogeneous

of degree one, the derived demand functions for their inputs may be
written as follows:41

(15)

t =

(16)

x5 =

(17)

tc =

ht(w.p)c

(18)

x =

h(w,p)c

g(w,p)s
g(w,p)s

where among other restrictions on

they are all homogeneous

of degree zero.42 If the wife is in the labor force we know that:
(19)

t
£

=T—tC —tS #0

and substituting this value of t into the budget constraint yields
(20)

V + w'T =

w't C

x
xc + w'tS + p xs

+ p x

If the wife is not in the labor market multiplying equation (13) by
her "shadow wage rate", w*, and adding the resulting equation to equation (14) yields
(21)

V + w*T =

w*t c + p x + w*tS + p x
xc
xs

Equation (20) is the constraint binding the household If the wife is in
the labor force and equatIon (21) is the constraint if she is not.

-33There is somewhat less than meets the eye in this similarity between the Becker and Willis models because the budget constraint
in the Willis model is really a combination of one constraint which is
binding when the wife is in the labor market and one which is binding
when she is not.45 This situation is shown In Figure 8.

The curve c'as' Is the production possibilities frontier associated with
equations Q.O. (1l. Q.3 and (14). The nonlinear portion c' a shows the

situation In which the wife is not working in the labor market and the

linear portion as' shows the situation in which she is working in the
labor market. The cause of this rather unusual production possibilities
curve may be stated simply. When the wife participates in the labor mar-

ket her wage rate is fixed (by assumption) at w' regardless of how many
hours she works and therefore p5 and c remain fixed. Moving upwards

and to the left along the production possibilities frontier from s'a
causes the wife's hours of work to decline steadily46 until at point a
the wife stops working in the labor market. Continuing along the curve

I

•
from a to c', the wife's shadow wage rate rises because of the
assumption that c production is more time intensive than s production.47
The increase in the wife's shadow wage causes the price of c to rise
relative to the price of s and this is reflected in the curvature of

the constraint between a and c'.
The Willis model has four exogenous variables, V, w, T, and
•

Unfortunately, without further assumptions the model has no

implication for the direction of the change in fertility for any given

change in one of the exogenous variables. Changes in V, w, T, and p,
produce income effects and alter

and p5 .

Once the income and

relative price effects are identified, the analysis of the model is
identical to that of the Becker model. However, the Becker model as we

have seen has no implications for fertility. In the Willis model a
change in a single exogenous variable often produces both income and

relative price effects and, in this case, the amalgam of changes, each
of which may be positively or negatively related to fertility, stifl

produces a fertility response whose direction is indeterminant. Nonetheless, the framework of the model is quite useful and Willis has been
able to extrac1 from it quite a plausible explanation of observed

cross—sectional fertility differentials. This explanation will be
discussed in connection with Model IV below.48

A Standard Demand Theory Version of the Willis Model
The ambiguity with regard to implications for fertility in

the Willis Model has two roots: the specification of the utility

— 35

function

—

and the specification of the production structure. It is

helpful in understanding the Willis model to separate the influences
of these two segments of the structure and to consider a modified
model with the production structure of the Willis model and the utility

formulation of Model II above. This model may be written

Nonetheless, as a simplification which aids us in understanding the
Willis model it is quite useful.

Model IV combines the endogeneous relative prices of the

Willis model with the utility function of Model II. Once the income and

relative

price effects due to some change in the exogenous variables

are determined, the analysis of Model IV becomes identical to the

analysis of Model II. In Model IV, the constraint facing the household may be written

Pccl + pc2 + ... +

(38)

V + wT =

(39)

where

(40)

and p = wg(w,p) + pg(w,p)

=

PcCm +

wh(w,p) + ph(w,p)

This constraint differs from that in Model II only in that the income
concept is full income rather than money income and in that prices are
endogenous.

The distinction between whether the wife is in or out of

labor force remains important in Model IV. Let

us

make the following

definition:

or, in words, c is equal to total childservices. Now the constraint

The constraint is identical to the constraint in the Willis model and
has nonlinear and linear segments as shown in Figure 8.

Because of the differences in the utility functions between

Model III and Model IV the latter has some implications for fertility. A
discussion of the implications of Model IV follows. If the wife is
in the labor force both before and after an increase in husband's
income, V, then this increase must cause fertility to increase or

constant, but it can never cause it to decline.

An analogous

If the wife is in the labor force both before and after an

Increase in either V or T , full income increases and relative
prices remain fixed.53 This

where income increased and it was shown below that in that situation

fertility could not decrease and possibly could increase.54 If the

could not consume at point b after
the increase in T without violating the assumption that s was a

a

the constraint. At aU such points, however, the relative price ratio

must be lower than it was at point a .58 The income effect and

therefore fertility cannot fall.

If the wife is out of the labor force before and after an in-

crease in the market wage rate w' ,

her

fertility is unaffected by

that change. If the wife is in the labor market both before

an

and after

increase in the market wage rate, the effect of this change upon

fertility is indeterminant. The increase in the wife's market wage

has an income effect which cet. . would (by assumption) cause
fertility to increase. flowever, the increase in w'

,

causes

c to

rise relative to p5t,59 and other things being equal, this, in turn,
would cause a decline in fertility and the resultant of these two
forces acting in opposite directions is of indeterminant sign.
From considerations similar to these Willis derives an empiri-

cally testable "mixture model" of fertility which he uses to explain

nonlinearjties in observed cross—sectional fertility patterns.60 The
fundamental assertions of the "mixture model" are, cet.
i) the effect on fertility of increasing the husband's income
is greater (i.e. more positive or less negative) when the wife's wage
rate is higher than when it Is lower;

— 41 —

ii)

the effect on fertility of increasing the wife's wage

rate is greater (i.e. more positive or less negative) when the husband's
income is lower than when it is higher.

The assertions which comprise the "mixture model" are not implications
of either Model III or Model IV, but rather are plausible interpre-

tations of these models. Statement 1) is derived from the following
argument. Holding everything else constant increasing wives' wage rates
tends to increase wives' labor force participation rates.61 The effect
of an increase in the husband's income has a positive effect on fertility if the wife is in the labor force and an ambiguous effect if

she is not. It is plausible, although not certain, that the effect

of an increase is V on fertility is smaller if the wife is not in
the labor force than if she is. Indeed, it is quite plausible that the

effect of increasing V Is to increase the fertility when the wife
is in the labor force and to decrease it when she Is not. If It is

true that the effect on fertility of increasing V is greater when the
wife is in the labor market then when she is not, then the impact of

an increase in V is greater the greater the wive's labor force par—
ticipation rate.

Statement ii) is derived from the following argument. Holding
everything else constant, increasing husband's incomes causes wives'

labor force participation rate to decrease.62 Increasing the wives'
wage rates only affects the fertility of women in the labor market.
If increasing wives' wage rates causes fertility to decline then as

wives' labor force participation rates decrease, due to increases in V ,

I

— 42 —

it is likely the negative effect of increasing w would diminish. In
the extreme case where wives' labor force participation rates were zero

there would be no negative effect at all. Nonlinearities in fertility
differentials of the sort described in statements i) and ii) have been
found in a wide array of fertility data.

63

The implications sketched above would be essentially identical to the considerations in the Willis model for determining fertility

if c entered the utility function as a normal good and fertility was
assumed to vary directly with c .

However,

c does not enter the

utility function at all; in its place are the separate arguments n

and e .

The added difficulty involved in such an approach, discussed

above in terms of the Becker model, turns all the sign implications of
the Model IV into ambiguous results and complicates the ambiguity of
those situations irr which the sign implications for fertility are already

unclear. Thus entertaining the Becker form of the utility function as
opposed to a utility structure which treats each child as a separate
entity has a substantial cost within the context of the Willis model.
One would exepct' economists to accept it only if there was some sub—

stantial benefit from doing so. To date, the existence of such benefits remains to be established.

There are clearly a number of facets of the Willis model which

can be elaborated and extended. However, sociologists frequently argue
that there is one particular portion of the model which is not in need

of elaboration or extension, but rather a candidate for removal: the
utility function. The core of this objection may be separated into two

— 43 —

parts.

The first half of the objection is that

fertility

control is

not perfect and parents often complete their childbearing years with
a number of children different from their preferred number.64 The
second half of the objection is that people

not choose their pre-

ferred number of children in a manner which seems rational or cons is—

tent from the point of view of an economic decision—making model.65
Acceptance of the latter conetntion, it should be noted, would underCut Leibenstein's approach no less than Becker's ——

the

presence of

some significant degree of implicit sociology in both formulations
notwithstanding.

The first objection can be eliminated within the framework
of models of utility—maximizing behavior by assuming that families
choose a contraceptive strategy rather than directly choosing a number

of children.66 The normative model then involves maximization of the
family's exepcted utility over possible contraceptive strategies. This
formulation may satisfy the first objection, but it certainly would not

satisfy the second. In orderto satisfy the second objection altogether
another framework for analysis is needed.

Modelling Fertility Behavior Without the Utility Maximization Hypothesis
There is another framework in which models of household production may fruitfully be viewed and which satisfies the second objec-

tion. That framework includes a statistical representation of the
behavior of a group of households. I have shown elsewhere67 that

it

—44—

is possible to develop a demand theoretic structure for group behavior

which did not presume that individual consuming units maximized a
utility function or acted according to a consistent set of preferences.
In order to accomplish this, assumptions about distributions of purchases
and how they change when economic conditions change were substituted
for assumptions about individuals' maximizing behavior.

Let us now consider another model of fertility which makes
use of the household production framework; this time a statistical
model of aggregate fertility behavior which does not assume anything

about the utility functions of individual families. First however,
some introductory comments are needed.

Standard demand theory envisions a single household making

choices subject to a constraint. These models, then, have two main
parts, the constraint and the representation of the individual's pre-

ferences. All the four models of fertility which have been discussed
above are of this nature. The statistical model of fertility behavior
which shall be considered below envisions a large number of households,
all of whom are subject to the same constraint.

Using Model IV as an

example, in Figure 1]. the standard demand analysis Is concerned with

how much c and s a single household will choose to consume':when it
is subject to the constraint

a1a2a3 .

If the household chooses a

point on the arc a1a2 the wife will not participate in the labor market.
If the household chooses a point on the line segment a2a3 ,

then

the

wife will participate in the labor market. In contrast, the statistical
model of fertility behavior considers a large number of households

—45—

distributed along the constraint. In general, there will be some households in which the wife participates in the labor market and some in

which she does not. Each household, though, consumes a particular

combination of s and c .

Let us suppose that there are m house-

holds whose consumption bundles are located at various points along the

constraint. The quantities of s and c consumed may be ordered from
the largest to the smallea so that

> S
51—2—
> 5 > ... —m
and

c1—2—
>c >...>c
—m
We denote the ordered set of the s by {s} and the ordered set of the
c1 by {c} and call them the distribution of s and the distribution of

c respectively.

The distributions of s and c may be represented graphically
by their distribution (or cumulative density) functions. Figure 11 shows

a constraint and its associated distribution of c •68

In Figure 11,

d1 is the proportion of families, subject to the constraint a1a2a3
which are childless. Generally, for any given quantity of childservices
consumed, say c2, the distribution function tells what percentage of
the families subject to the constraint consume a quantity of childservices

less than or equal to c2 .

Thus in Figure 1]- f percent of the house-

holds in question consume a quantity to c less than or equal to
Since all women for whom c <

c2

c2 are in the labor force, f is also

the wives' labor force participation rate. In Figure 11, a graph of

the distribution of s was not included, but it is logically no less
important than the distribution of c ;

it

can be derived from the con-

straint and the distribution of c in this two—dimensional case.
The major difference between the standard demand theory model
and the new demand theory model being considered here is that the standard
demand theory model consists of a constraint and a representation of the
tastes of a single household, while the new demand theory model consists
of a constraint and representations of purchase distributions of a large

group of households. Standard demand theory does not get very far on
constraints and utility functions alone and it has become standard practice to assume that the arguments of the utility function are normal

goods. Similarly the new demand theory does not get very far until an
analogous normality assumption is made. Before such an assumption can
be made, however, we must make the following definition.

Definition of an increase in the opportunity to consume a household
commodity:
Let us consider a n—dimensional production possibilities curve,

In essence, the normality assumption asks our forebearance

in the assertion that whenever the

constraint shifts upward and to the

right, the distribution functions of the quantities purchased of each

good also shift to the right.

Now we may state a household production model of fertility
behavior which does not assume that each family maximizes a utility
function.

Assumptions:

(i) C and H are homothetic production functions,
(ii) H is more intensive in the wives' time than C
(iii) there are m households consuming at various
points along the households' production
possibilities frontier,

(iv) s and c are normal goods in the sense of
normality given above,

(v) wives' time and numbers of children are
complementary in the production of childservices.

Model V differs from the original Willis model in a number of

ways. The most obvious difference is that there is no utility function

in Model V. It has been replaced by the assumption that there are m
households consuming at various points on their production possibilities

frontier. Another difference is that in the Willis model G( )

and

were assumed to be homogeneous of degree one while in Model V G( )

H( )

and

S

—50—

I
H(

)

are just assumed to be homothetic production functions, a consider-

able generalization of the initial Willis specification.

The childser—

vices production function here differs from that in the original Willis
model in that here the childservjceg production function includes the
number of children, whereas in the Willis model the quantity of child—
services

did not

depend on the number of children. Indeed, in

all four

previous models, it was assumed that holding the number of children

constant it was always possible to increase childservices by any
tnulitple

so long as time and goods inputs into children were increased

that multiple. In these models it is never envisioned that spending

by

ever more time and
to

goods on a fixed number

of

children could ever lead

diminishing returns. In the specification used in Model V, if G(;)

and

H( )

were

homoegeneous of degree one, a doubling,

for example,

of c could be obtained by doubling the time and goods spent on children
and the number of children; doubling the time and goods spent on children without increasing the number would not double childservices, but

rather increase it by a smaller multiple.
Putting the number of children into the childservices production

function is not without some difficulty, however. If

treated

n is

to be

as an input, it must have a price either in terms of wives'

time, market

goods

or both. The question then becomes, "how much does

a live birth cost in terms of market goods and the wife's time?" In

Model V, n appears in neither the wives' time constraint nor the
budget constraint. In other words, it is assumed that the time and money

I

—51—

costs of producing a live birth are zero. In reality of course, this is
not the case, but I have excluded them from this particular model for
ease' of exposition. Further, I do not believe their inclusion would
aid in the explanation of either time series trends or cross—sectional

differentials in fertility. This is not a crucial simplification,
however; the reader may easily produce the modifications needed to

treat both a time and a money cost of producing a live birth. Since,

in this model live births are costless, the production function H
must be one such that the marginal product of children can become zero
72

when n is within a plausible range.

The derived demand functions drawn from equations (43) and
(44) may be written

= g1(w,p,)

(47)

(s)

g(w,p) 4 (s)
=
h(w,p) 'P (c)
= h(w,p) 'P (c)

(48)

x5 =

(49)

t

(50)

x

(51)

n =

hn(WPx)

where, among other restrictions,

'P (c)

and h

are homogeneous

of degree zero and where 4(s) and 'P(c) are strictly increasing
functions of their arguments.

73

The time and budget consgraints, equations (45) and (46) may

be combined into a single equation as was done in equation (27) above.
Thus we obtain:

(52)

V +wT = c(s) (wg(w,p) + pg(w,p)) + 'P(c)(wh(w,p)

+ PxhxPx

—52—

and

(s)

V + wT =

(53)

where p

and

PS + 1'(c) PC

are defined as in equations (25) and (26) above.

Clearly, if this constraint is interpreted as relating s) and ''(c)

rather than s and c
c

and

,

it

is identical to the constraint relating

s

in the case of linear homogeneous production functions. Equa-

tion (53), which is graphically represented in Figure 8, has

a

linear

segment for the situation in which women are in the labor force and
a nonlinear segment covering the situation in which women are not in
the labor force.

In Model V average fertility, in situation

The terms 1) and 2) are the

however, it is not necessary to assume that we have observed the same

Thus, we have demonstrated that the average fertility of comparable groups

This result is clearly similar to the result in Model IV, for increasing

V while the wife remains in the labor market.

In

Model IV, it was shown that if the wife was not in the

labor force both before and after an increase in V ,

the

resulting

direction of the fertility change could not be predicted. A similar
statement concerning average fertility can be made for Model V. Let
be the number of women not participating in the larbor market at

the lower level of V and let r2 be the number not participating
at the higher level of V .

The analysis of Model V can continue in the same vein until
it is shown that for every implication for fertility in Model IV is

matched by an analogous result for average fertility in Model V. Let

us consider next what happens when T is greater in situation 2 than
in situation 1. This case is shown in Figure 13.

The distribution function beneath that portion of

the

We have just demonstrated that without the assumption

of

a household production

which comes to essentially the same conclusions as the original

Willis model. The main

statistical

differences

between the Willis model and the

aggregate model presented here are:

.

. ,m

-63-

1. The Willis model assumes that a single household maximizes
its utility function whereas the present model deals with aggregates and
substitutes postulates on group behavior for the postulates on individual behavior used in the Willis model.

2. The present model yields implications for changes in average behavior for discrete changes in the independent variables while
the Willis model yields implications for a single family's behavior for
infinitesimal changes in the independent variables.

3. More general homothetic production functions were used
in the present model as opposed to linear homogeneous production functions in the Willis model.

That with all these changes the implications of the Willis model remain
essentially unchanged shows that the features of the production
ture embedded in the original Willis model give rise to conclusions
which are quite robust.

The Non—Utilitarian Model of Fertility: Some Future Developments
In addition to implications analogous to those of the Willis
model, Model V potentially has implications which go quite beyond any-

thing in the Willis model. Of all the models considered in this chapter
only Model V could have implications for changes in the partiy distri-

bution of fertility. The other models deal only with a single family so
that their parity distributions of fertility are nothing but single

points. In contrast, Model V deals with a large group of families; it

—64—

p
envisions

a situation in which, given the same values of the exogenous

variables, some families will have many children, some will have a few,

and some will have none at all. Since marked changes over time have
been observed in parity distributions of fertility in the U.S., it
would be interesting to discover if the implications of Model V for

changes in

This is

a new and complex topic whose full treatment would require a

separate monograph. Rather than treating it here, the derivation of
these implications shall be deferred until after the observed changes
in parity distributions have been discussed in Chapters 3 and 4.

Another possible line of development of Model V is toward a
reinterpretation of the Easterlin—Fuchs intergenerational relative income

hypothesis. Since Model V allows for the consideration of discrete
changes in exogenous variables, we may use It as an intergenerational

model of fertility. Let us consider two situations, the first representing the lifetime economic conditions facing the parent generation
and the second representing the lifetime economic conditions facing their

children's generation. We assume that the husbands' real income and the
wives' real wage rate are higher in the children's generation than in
the parents;, but that the wives' time constraint is identical in both

generations. The production possibilities frontiers for the parents'

and the children's generations are shown below in Figure 15. As it
stands, this intergenerational model of fertility has no implications
for fertility either for women who are in the labor market or for those
who are not.

The reason for this lack of implications is not because of a
change in tastes, for in Model V this would have to be manifested by a

violation of the Normality Assumption stated above. Rather, with the
Normality Assumption inviolate, the absence of implications arises

because increases in husbands' Income and the wives' wage rates generate conflicting income and substitution effects, both in the case where
the wife is in the labor market and in the case where she is not.82
Must the model be discarded as unilluminating, or is it possible to
obtain from it some reasonably firm implications about fertility behavior?
In order to obtain some implications, it Is necessary to say something

about the distributions of c and s and it is here that the intergenerational relative income hypothesis plays a role.

The Easterlin—Fuchs intergenerational relative income hypothesis suggests that young people's tastes and expectations regarding
their material standards of living are formed when they are adolescents

in their parents' households. For ease of exposition let us consider an
extreme form of this hypothesis which states that the distribution of

s in the children's generation depends the economic conditions they
experienced as adolescents, but not on their own

economic conditions.83

If the economic conditions of the children's generation differ from
what they expected on the basis of their adolescent experiences, the
entire difference is absorbed by changes in their production of child—

services. Clearly in this extreme form, the Easterlin—Fuchs hypothesis
Is analogous to Friedman's permanent income hypothesis,84 with child—
services playing the role of savings in the Friedman model.

However, even given the extreme version of the Easterlln—Fuchs
hypothesis Model V is short on implications for intergenerational fertility

differentials. In order to see this let us consider the following conceptual experiment. Let us consider dividing a cOhort of adults who
have had the same adolescent background into two groups, one of which
experiences lower economic growth and therefore faces the lifetime con-

straint a1a5 and the other experiences more rapid economic growth and
This situation is shown in Figure 16.
therefore faces the lifetime constraint b1b5 .
the distribution

/ If

of s is the same for both groups because their adolescent experiences

were identical then the jth (kth) family (in the distribution of s )

would consume at a2(a4) given the lower rate of economic growth and
at b (b )

given

the higher rate of economic growth. Nonetheless, the

model has no implications for fertility since without further restrictions it is impossible to tell whether fertility is higher or lower

at b2(b4) than at a2(a4) since not only is

(c) higher at b2(b4)

than at a2(a4) but the wives' wage rate is also higher at

at a2(a4) .

b2(b4) than

The positive income effect and the negative relative price

effect offset one another leaving no a priori sign for the change in
fertility.

Thus even with the addition of the Easterlin—Fuchs hypothesis
in its extreme form Model V is not sufficiently articulated to produce

implications for intergenerational fertility changes. Clearly, additional
specifications must be added to the model if it is to produce such impli-

cations. But which ones? Perhaps the best approach would be to consider
known

temporal

and cross—sectional fertility variations and to try to find

—68—

.

restrictions on the model which cause it to reproduce those patterns of

variation. However, it was our original intent to discover what economic
models

of fertility told us

about time series movements in fertility.

Clearly, we have come full circle. In order to make our models better,
we must have a better and more detailed knowledge of the temporal behavior
of fertility.

Becker calls average real expenditure per child "child quality".
Generally, definitions are not subject to arguments pro and con but
this particular definition, I believe, is particularly misleading.
Among the general populace child quality is usually associated with
health, beauty, talent, certain pleasing personality traits, and other such

(continued)

characteristics of children to which the contribution of real ex-

penditures is often quite minimal. Moreover, it is not generally
accepted that average real expenditure per unit is a particularly

good measure of quality for durable goods in general. Suppose two
people bought identical automobiles one of which wOrked beautifully

and th other of which was a lemon. The person who purchased the
lemon is likely to spend considerably more ntoney on his auto than

the person who bought the car which functioned perfectly. Yet, we
are hardly likely to say that the person who bought the lemon had
the higher quality automobile just because his real expenditure per

unit was higher than that of the other person. Indeed, we would say
just the reverse.

Let us consider another example of how Becker's definition of

child quality could be misleading. Suppose someone had a professional photographer come to his home to take photographs of his

children and his automobile. Most people would not think that either
the quality of the car or the quality of the children would be en-

hanced thereby. Nonetheless, Becker's definition of child quality
and the quality of the automobile
would lead us to say that the quality of the children/increased because their pictures were taken. In footnote 38, we argue that the
confusion in terminology grows even worse in the context of models
of household production.

Economists have no monopoly on the study of fertility and if
they are to interact fruitfully with people in other disciplines it

is incumbent upon them to keep nonessential semantic difficulties

—72--

to

a minimum.

For this reason, I do not accept Becker's definition

of child quality and until something better comes along whenever I
wish to say "average real expenditure per child" I shall use the
inelegant phrase "average real. expenditure per child."

It is assumed in Model II that

the

price index for the child ex-

penditure bundle is invariant with respect to birth order.

This is

not a crucial assumption of the model and its implications remain
intact even if the price index varies with parity.
23.

A normal good is defined as one f or which the demand increases as

income increases if all the relevant relative prices are held con-

stant. There is one exception to this rule. If there was none of
a good consumed before and

The reason that the two constraints both pass through the same point
is that

chosen

such that the point of tangency of equa-

tion (4) with an indifference was a point on equation (5).

By pure cross—substitution effect of a price change, we mean the

—73—

effect on other goods of changing the price of one good while
holding utility constant.
27.

Another way to understand why even changes in

have an ambiguous

effect on fertility in the Becker model is to notice that if the
pure price elasticities with respect to simultaneous proportional
changes
the

in

the shadow prices of n and e are not identical then

differences

in the price elasticities cause induced relative

shadow price changes between n and e which could offset the
initial price change.
28.

If both goods in the Becker model had a quality dimension then
there would be four argimiants in the utility function, the quantity

and quality of each of the two goods. In addition, there would be

three

endogenous shadow price ratios as

opposed to two in the simpler

model. There would also be considerably greater difficulties because
the ambiguity is compounded by the interaction of yet another variable about which little is known a priori.
29.

This result can simply be obtained by adding the first two equations
labeled (A13) in Becker—Lewis (1973), p. S286.

Models IV and V below are such models. The discussion of Model IV

.

begins on page 34.
37.

Assumption ii) may be restated as follows: given any values of the
wife's wage rate and the price of goods the ratio of wife's time to

market goods used in the production of c is greater than the ratio
of wife's time to goods used in the production of S.

38.

Willis follows Becker and calls e child quality. However, this
term is quite misleading in the context of a model of household

production. Although it is convenient to speak of household production functions and a household production structure, the activities of the household which are represented in this fashion partake
both of the character of production activities and consumption ac-

tivities. Suppose parents take their children to a park on a Sunday
for the purposes of admiring the scenery, drinking in some sunshine

and playing with their children in the park environment. Some of the
value of the parents' time spent at the park would be correctly allocated to the childservices production function, as would a portion

of the cost of transporting the family to the park. Nonetheless, it
is

quite confusing to claim that child quality has increased just

because the

parents have played with their children. We do not claim

that the quality of phonograph records increases as they are played

more and more. We do not claim that the quality of an automobile
increases as it is driven more miles. Why should we assume that all

.

—75—

38.

(continued)

time and goods spent on children increase child quality? But then
again perhaps children are not like other consumer durables. See fn. 18.
39.

The model is meant to be a one—period lifetime model of fertility

where T is the length of a couple's married life together.
40.

To avoid confusion, the wife's market wage rate is denoted w' and
the wife's shadow wage rate when she does not participate in the labor

market is denoted w*. In those contexts where either wage concept

may be appropriate the symbol w is used.
hours
The implicit assumption is that the wife is free to work any number of /

she chooses at the market wage rate w'. If the wife's wage rate rose
as her lifetime hours of work rose, this would complicate the model,

but would not change its thrust. See Willis (1973), p. 38
41.

The derived demand functions are simply functions which tell us the
cost minimizing input mix for any quantity of output and any set of

relative factor prices. In the case of production functions which
are homogeneous of degree one, these derived demand functions must

be multiplicative in output and a function of relative prices. If
it were not mutiplicative then the ratio of factor inputs would de-

pend on the scale of output and that cannot be the case for any
homogeneous production function.
42.

It must be true that

ht, and h are homogeneous of degree

zero because the cost minimizing quantities of inputs demanded de-

pends only on relative prices not the absolute level of prices. This
is just one of the restrictions on the functions of the input prices.

It is not strictly necessary in Model IV to assume that the produc-

tion functions for childservices are independent of parity. Hicks—
nuetral technological differences between production functions for
different parities can be assumed without altering the analysis.

The

assumption made in

the text that production functions for child-

services are independent of parity is made purely for expositional
ease.

The relative price of s and c only depend on the ratio of the
wife's wage to the price of goods. If the latter is constant so is
the former.

It is important to note that Rybczynski's Theorem holds in particu-

portions of the constraint. An algebraic representation of s at
the point of transition,which illustrates Rybczynski's Theoremcan
be found in equation 6 in footnote 46.

This line of reasoning utilizes the fact that along the nonlinear

portion of the constraint p5/p

falls as a increases. See

Since, in reality, we usually deal with a finite number of families,
assumption
we have written the normality/in terms consistent with this observa-

tion. However, it usually is more aesthetically pleasing to draw
the figures on the basis of a continuous distribution of families.

To put the normality assumption in terms of continuous distribution
functions, let us consider two

F2( )

distribution

and

functions F0( )

defined over the closed interval [o,a]. The normality

assumption may now be restated:
if

addition,

some value of Z in the interval [o,a], say

such that F2 (Z) <

In this definition F(1) is the distribution function for situation i.

.

—81—

72.

It is not beyond belief that, holding other inputs into child—

services fixed, the number of children which parents have is such
that the contribution of an additional child to the production of
childservices would be negative.
73.

In order to understand why (

) and V( )

must be strictly in-

creasing functions of their arguments, let us consider the implica-

tions of that not being so. Suppose s >

and

=

That would imply that it is possible to produce more output with
no increase in inputs which would be inconsistent with G being a
production function.
74.

See pages 37 and

75.

All

the

38.

following figures are drawn on the assumptions that i) the

wives' labor force participation rate lies between zero and

and

ii)

unity,

the distribution function never has a slope of aero except

at 100%.
76.

In the case of a finite number of discrete households it is possible

that there exist sufficiently small changes in the exogenous variables such that the number of women in the labor force does not
change.
77.

Generally speaking, since the ordering of the families can change
between situation 1 and situation 2, the same women need not be in

the labor force in both periods. However, since people only have
one lifetime, it is impossible to observe the same family before
and after changes in lifetime exogenous variables.

not shift because if it did it would necessarily violate either the

Normality Assumption as it applies to c or as it applies to s.
82.

Below, the conflicting income and substitution effects which arise
when the wife is out of the labor force have been discussed in some

detail. Conflicting income and substitution effects now arise even
when the wife is in the labor force because we have assumed that
the children's generation has both a higher husband's income and a
higher wives' wage rate than the parents' generation.
83.

In essence this assumption states that the distribution of s in
the childrens' generation is invariant to their own economic conditions.
