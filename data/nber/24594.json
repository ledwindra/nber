    "abstract": "\n\nIn this paper, we examine what groups of children are served by core childhood social-safety net programs\u2014including Medicaid, EITC, CTC, SNAP, and AFDC/TANF\u2014and how that\u2019s changed over time. We find that virtually all gains in spending on the social safety net for children since 1990 have gone to families with earnings, and to families with income above the poverty line. This is the result of welfare reform and the expansion of in work tax credits. We review the available research and find that access to safety net programs during childhood leads to benefits for children and society over the long run. This evidence suggests that the changes to the social safety net may have lasting negative impacts on the poorest children.\n\n",
