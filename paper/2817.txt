The composition of union members shifted from private sector blue collar

workers to public sector and white collar workers in all countries, producing
increased divisions within union movements by category of worker. (Section 2.2)
3) Changes in the industrial composition of employment, changes in public
attitudes toward unionism, and the growth of governmental protection of labor
do not explain the divergence in density (Section 3.1)

doing better in countries with high inflation.

In addition, unemployment

raised density in settings where unions disperse unemployment benefits.
(Section 3.2;

The primary reason for the divergence are differences in the

incentives and opportunities different industrial relations systems give
employers to oppose unions.

Unions fated best in neo-corporatist settings and

worst in settings where decentralised bargaining creates a strong profit
incentive for managers to oppose unions and where msnageeent is relatively free
to act on that incentive. (Section 3.3; Section 3.5)

CHANCES IN UNIONISM ANONO DEVEIDFED COUNTRIES

In

contrast

to business firms, which behave similarly in all capitalist

countries, maximizing profits or somethtng close akin, trade unions have a
"national" dimension, operating under distinct institutional arrangements
across countries.

In the United States unions negotiate detailed collective

bargaining contracts with fires; in Sweden they are involved in national wagesetting and nee-corporatist social agreements; in Australia they argue wage
cases before arbitration tribunals; in France they negotiate industry or
regional minima that are extended to entire sectors; in Japan they represent
workers at the company level and organize tha Shunre offensive; etc.

Separated

by national barriers, union movements are like distinct species of animals,
developing differently in some dimensions even in similar economic and
technological

environments.

In the

1970s and 1980s the union representation

of

workers underwent particularly dramatic changes across developed countries,

rising in

some

countries to

force, while falling sharply in other countries.

At the same time the

countries, as

sector worker share of union members rose while the

and private sector manufacturing workers share of members

fell.

Divergence in Union Density
The first and seemingly simplest fact to establish is the claimed

divergence in union density among countries.
membership

Because counts of union

countries but not in others; come from diverse sources - -

labor

force surveys,

reports by unions, employer surveys, union financial records (see Eurostat for

a detailed comparison of union data by country); and reflect differences in
what unions do in different settings, however, the seemingly simple is fraught
with problems.

As examples of the difficulties in cross-country comparisons

note the following: in Australia unions represent virtually all workers before
the tribunals that formally set wages but enlist only half of the work force;
in France and Germany unions have a larger role in wage-setting than density
figures indicate because agreements between representative employers and unions
are legally extended to other employers; in Italy the growth of autonomous
union groups in the public sector and of quadri among foremen and lower level
management makes membership data from the major confederations an incomplete
indicator of union organisation (Minestero del L.avoro e della Previdenza
Sociale, 1988).

These and other data/conceptual problems mean that even the

most careful estimates of density provide only crude indicators of crosscountry differences in union strength and must be informed by direct knowledge
of institutions so as not to be misleading.
This said, exhibit 1 records estimates of the union proportion of nonagricultural wage and salary workers in OECD countries from 1970 to the mid1980s.

While comparisons of changes in density over time are less likely to be

distorted by cross-country differences than are comparisons of levels, even the
trends are not problem free.

The United Kingdom figures understate the l980s

decline in British density as some unions exaggerated membership to maintain
high representation in the Trade Union Congress and Labor Party.

The American

data mix two opposing trends: a disastrous drop in private sector density and a
spurt in public sector unionism.

The Italian data may overstate the 1980s drop

due to absence of membership outside the three confederations.

REASONS FOR THE DIVERGENCE
Several hypotheses can be advanced for explaining the divergence in

density: changes in the composition of employment, in attitudes toward
unionism, and in governmental protection of labor which reduce worker desires
to organise; macro-economic developments; management opposition to unionism;
and differential responses of union movements to the problems of the period.

3.1 Structural Explanations
One oftan suggested explanation for changing unionismtion ara differonrial
changas in rho composition of employment among jobs or workors, which in tho
1970s and 1980s took tha form of
araas.

a

shift toward traditionally loss unionizod

In countrias where employment shifted rapidly froa manual to white

collar jobs, from goods to service industries, from small to large firms, and
from female to male or from less educated to more educated workers, unions are,
after all, likely to have greater difficulties organizing than in countries
where those shifts occur more slowly.

The ahift hypothesis does nor, however, stand up to scrutiny.

Shifts in

the composition of employment cannot explain divergent country experiences
because shifts have occurred similarly across countries: the share of
employment in manufacturing fell, for example, by roughly as much in high and
or
increasing density Sweden, Canada, or Denmark as in the de-unionising U.S.
Japan. (2)

Contrary to the shift hypothesis, moreover, large changes in union

representation are accompanied by changes in density within sectors, as exhibit

3 demonstrates for countries with declining unionism.

A

second possible explanation for diverging union density is that public

opinion of unions has come to differ greatly among countries.

Perhaps density

is declining in countries where the public has less favorable attitudes and
increasing/stabilizing in those where the public has more favorable attitudes.
Lipset (1986), for one, has argued that reduced public approval is a major
cause of the decline in American union density.

I reject this hypothesis as inconsistent with within-country and crosscountry and evidence.

Pirar, there is little relation within countries between

changes in opinion po11s and in union density.

Polls for the U.K. show that

attitudes toward unionism became more favorable during the 1980s decline in
unionism; while those for the U.S. show public approval of unions steady

between 1972 and 1965 when density fell sharply in the

private

sector and rose

in the public sector, where public opinion ought to be especially important.(3)

of opinion polls
Perhaps most strikingly, comparisons

between the United States and Canada show that Canadians have, if anything,
less favorable attitudes toward unions than Americans (Chaison and Rose, 1988>,
which runs counter to the decline in density in the United States and stable
density in Canada.

A

third possibility is that the divergence results from differential

changes in worker need for unionism among countries.

Changes in union density are, moreover,

oncorrelated with levels or changes in real wages across countries, contrary to
what one would expect if high or improving pay reduced the desire for unions
(4).

If none of the above explains the divergence in density, what does?

3.2 MACRo-ECONOMIC FACTORS
One likely factor is the differing macro-economic experiences of countries,
On the basis of studies of the cyclical pattern of union growth, high
unemployment, low inflation, and slow economic growth ought to reduce unionism
while the opposite conditions should increase density. (5)

To explore this hypothesis I contrast in exhibit 4 the growth of employment
and GOP per capita, the rate of inflation, and the rate of unemployment between
countries with increasing, decreasing, and roughly stable union density.
results are, with the exception of inflation, rather mixed.

The

Rapid inflation is

associated with union growth, presumably because nonunion workers see a need
for contractual arrangements to preserve real earnings.

Employment growth is

higher in declining union density countries while growth of COP per capita and
most strikingly, unemployment rates do not differ noticeably.

Exhibit 6 these patterns or lack of patterns hold up in multivariate

regressions covering longer periods of time,

the lack of a linear relation

between unemployment and changes in density is partly attributable to the
concordance of high unemployment and increased union density in Belgium and
Denmark - - two countries where for historical reasons unions disperse
government-funded unemployment benefits (as in Sweden and Finland), inducing
workers who lose jobs to maintain or join unions in periods of increasing
unemployment.

3.3 MANACEMKNT OPPOSITION TO UNIONISM
The factor that, I believe, explains best the divergence in union
experiences are differential changes in the difficulty of organising new
workers due to changes in the level and effectiveness of management opposition
to unionism.

Here, the rapidly de-uniontaing United States is the prima facie

case of what aggressive management can do to unionism.

In the 1910s and 1980s

U.S. management turned against unions and collective bargaining to a degree not
seen anywhere else in the free world.

Virtually all firms that faced National

Labor Relations Board representation elections (the government-run secret
ballot process by which American workers can choose to unionise) engaged in
expensive aggressive campaigns to persuade/pressure workers to reject unions.
Unfair labor practices of diverse forms (including firing upwards of a thousand
union activists in a year) skyrocketed to rates five or six times those in
aarller decades.

Large nonunion firms consciously copied union seniority and

grievance procedures to deter employee interest in unions.

Forty-five percent

of the relatively progressive firms in the Conference Board's Personnel Forum
declared in 1983

that

operating 'union-free' was their main labor goal (Kochan,

McKersie, and Chalykoff, 1986)

-

-

a far cry from the 1950s and 1960s when most

large firms accepted unions at the work place.

Even when workers voted to

14

of ihe
unioniae, moreover, management avoided a first contract in one-third
cases, effectively negating the election.

On the basis of diverse studies that

show management opposition to have been a major factor in the failure of unions
to organism in the period (Freeman, 1985), moat analysts have come to believe
that it is a, if not the, major cause of the decline in private aeccor density.
is that
Why did American management declare war on unions? One reason
unionism became more costly to firma.

It became more costly because the union

end because growth of trade,
wage premium rose In the 1970a (Freeman, 1986)
it
deregulation, and other factors increased product market competition, making
more difficult to pay above-market wages.

A second reason

is

the growth of a

militant market-oriented ideology that juatified virtually any anti-union
action as preserving managerial flexibility.
development of

a

A third reason is the

sophisticated union-prevention technology that exploits the

opportunities U.S. labor laws give management to campaign against unions.

In

Canada, where labor law limits management's ability to fight unions, often by

all out to
certifying unions after card checks, many of the same firms that go
defeat unions in the U.S. accept unionisation of their Canadian plants.
Is management opposition important in other countries with rapidly
declining density?

In the United Kingdom, the principal cause of the l980s drop in density
which
appears to be the Thatcher government's industrial relations laws,
shifted the balance of power at workplaces to management and weakened the
ability of unions to organime. (Freeman and Pelletier, 1989)

While management

shown in the U.S.
opposition to unionism ham not taken the form or virulence
the new features of the law have enhanced resistance to union activities.
In Japan, government and management opposition have played a major role in
the drastic loss of membership of Kokuro, the militant union of now privatized

15

Japanese National Railway.

Once the latgest taitway union with over 500,000

meobers, in 1988 it had only 62,000 members due to management's union busting
tactics. (Nagashima, 1988)

Similarly, the Japanese Teachers Union has suffered

major losses of membership due in part to government efforts to discourage
newly-hired teachers from joining the union.

More importantly, data on the

number of workers newly organised shows a pattern remarkably like that in the
United States, with the bulk of the drop in unionism attributable to a
precipitous fall in union organisation of new workers relative to the growing
work force. The drop in new organisation occurred after the oil shock placed
severe economic pressures on Japanese employers, was accompanied by changes in
court interpretation of lehour law favorable to managssent,

and was concentrated

in industries facing the greatest profits squeeze (Freeman and Rebbick, 1989)
Civen the close ties between companies and unions in an enterprise union
system, and the role of white collar employees in company unions, I find it

hard to believe that changes in company attitudes toward unionism has not
played a role in the inability of unions to organism new workplaces.

In Italy and the Netherlands, management opposition of the American or
milder British type would appear to have little to do with the observed
changes.

The l980s decline in density in Italy has bean attributed to the

disorganisation of the union movement that developed after 1983.

The 1980s

decline in density in the Netherlands may be largely the result of the high
unemployment that devaloped in the mid-1910s and persisted for over a decade.
What about management behavior in countries where union density reached
unprecedented peaks in the period under study?

If differences in management

opposition contributed to the divergence, one would expect less opposition in
those countries, either because firms have little profit incentive to avoid
unionism or little legal or institutional opportunity to express opposition.

16

The prime factor that appears to reduce the profit incentive to fight
unions is centralized wage negotiations.

In countries where unions and

management engage in national bargaining -managementa form employers'

federations

so-called

neo-corporatist systecs - -

to establish going national wages and

often presaure nonunion firms to recognize unions, presumably to assure that
they pay the going rate. The notion that business should engage in a jihad for
union-free environment as in the United States is anathema to employers in such

a setting. Unionism has accordingly fared well, with density increasing in the
1970s and l9BOs aven though density was already high at the outset of both
periods (exhibit 5).
Countries where the state extends collective contracts to nonunion firms
such as Germany and France and where workers are represented by works councils
(much of Western Europe) might also appear to give employers little reason to
oppose unions at the plant level.

Here, however, the likelihood that plant-

level agreements will go beyond representative contracts suggests that
employers will be more opposed to unions than in neo-corporstist settings.

In

fact, unionisation trends in Germany and in France (as best one csn tell from
available data) are intermediate between those of the U.S., U.K. in the
Thatcher era, and Japan end the neo-corpormtist countries.
Finally, the growth/stability of unionism in Canada and in Ireland shows
that even in industrial relations systems where management has a substantial
profit incentive to oppose unions legsl restrictions on opposition can produce
developments that differ from those in neighboring countries (U.S.
where the laws are less favorable to organisation.

3.4 UNION RESPONSE
Another likely cause for diverging union densities are cross-country
differences in union responses to economic changes.

Sidestepping wege setting

(most uoion movements moderated wage demands relative to inflation for the sake
of job security or to reduce unemployment) and strike hehavior (strike daya
lost fell in the l980a in all countries) there was a wide rango of union
organizational responses to the crisis of the l970s/80s.
The Australian union movement made pethsps the most dramatic adjustment to
the new economic environment.

After careful study of the German and Swedish

experiences, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) sought to ttansfotm
Australian industrial relations from a confronrational British-style system to

a neo-corporatiat system, in part to preempt growing anti-union management
sentiment that might fuel ILS. or U.K. type losses of membership.

In the mid

1980s the Secretary-Treasurer of the ACTU was doing him beat to convince
constituent unions to accept a national wages accord that required aome unions
to take lnwër wage settlements than they could otherwise get.
The American labor movement reacted more sluggishly.

In the 1970s many top

AFL-CIO leaders downplayed felling density on the grounds that absolute
membership was stable end that an economic boom would cute all.

"The Changing

Since then national unimns have

been slew to adopt the "evolutionary blueprint" laid out in the report.

While

many now offer union Mastercards with attractively low rates of interest for
their members (McDonald, 1987) few have actively pursued the key recoronendation
to create new forms of membership outside the collective bargaining structure.

A major reason for the slow adaption is the decentralized structure of

19

organized labor, which consists of some 90 or so independent national unions in
the AFL-CIO; others outside the federation; and hundreds of independent locals
within the national unions.

Each national and local has its own concerns,

guaranteeing slow response to prohlems chat affect unionism in general and
making problematic implementation of reforms recoumsended

by the AFL-CIO.

In the United Kingdom there has been a similar effort to devise new
benefits (of the U.S. mastercard type)

to attract workers.

There hmva also,

however, been more dramatic changes in industrial relations practices in some
sectors: the Miners Union split; the Electricians and Engineering unions have
developed cooperative single plant/singla union bargaining strategies; tha
Boilermakers, among othars, have sought to enlist pert-time workers.

The big

organizational change is, however, be the splitting of the Trade Union Congress

when it revoked membership of the Electricians in Sapteebar 1988,
In some other countries where unions have been in trouble, there have been
structural changes in union organizations.

In Japan, two federations, Dcmei

and Churitsu Roren, have dissolved and their private sector unions have formed
the new federation Rengo to break free from the more politicized public sector
unions.

confederations, which united briefly in the early l980a, separated to engage in
competitive recruiting efforts, each with its own style and selling points.
3,5 regression analysis
To estimate the quantitative impact of some of the aformentioned factors on
its
cross-country changes in union density. I pooled data on density and
determinants across 18 developed OECD countries for the period 1913-1985 and
estimated a regression model linking changes (d) in density (DENS) to: a dummy
variable for corporatist industrial relations (CORE);

the rate of inflation

(INF); changes in the uneoployment rate (ONE); a dummy variable for union
delivery of unemployment benefits interacted with changes in the unemployment

20
rate (Ul*dUNE); and selected other variables (Z).

Because density is bounded

betweeo 0 and I I use a log odds ratio form as well as a linear form:
dDENS or dln(DENS/l-DENS) — a + bINF + cdUNE + Ul*dUNE+ eCORP +
where Z

— setof

fZ + u,

variables that includes growth of employment and growth of COP

per capita and a vecror of dummy variables for individual years.

Controlling

for individual years removes common cyclical variation from the data to locus

on the cross-country differences of concern.
The regression estimates summarized in exhibit 6 show that, consistent with
the simpler tabulations given earlier, density grew more in countries with
corporetist industrial relations; with rising unemployment when unions deliver
unemployment benefits; and with rapid inflation.

CONCLUDING COMMENTS
This study baa shown that, contrary to the view that industrial relations

converges as countries develop (Kerr, Dunlop, I4arbison,

end Meyers). union

density diverged among developed countries in the 1970m and l9BOs.

As all of

the countries are advanced capitalist economies undergoing similat economic
changes, the divergence implies that relatively modest differences in the
institutions thef govern labor relations extort e substantial influence on the
evolution of unionism.

The decline in union density in the United States and

Japan, where unions were thought to be parr of the established order, furthur
implies that private sector unionism is a more fragile institution than is
widely recognized.

The broad implication

is

that in a world of economic and

social flux the structuring of labor relations is not a once-and-for-all
process of setting up procedures and insrirurions. Rather, it is a process
that must be undertaken time and again as environinentml

changes alter the

balance of power barween workers and management and their conflicting and
coincident interests. Therm is no rear in rho practice or study of industrial
relations.
