    "abstract": "\n\nWe analyze the individual and macroeconomic impacts of heterogeneous expectations and action rules within an agent-based model populated by heterogeneous, interacting firms. Agents have to cope with a complex evolving economy characterized by deep uncertainty resulting from technical change, imperfect information, coordination hurdles and structural breaks. In these circumstances, we find that neither individual nor macroeconomic dynamics improve when agents replace myopic expectations with less na\u00efve learning rules. Our results suggest that fast and frugal robust heuristics may not be a second-best option but rather \u201crational\u201d responses in complex and changing macroeconomic environments.\n\n",
