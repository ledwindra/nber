Sectoral Productivity Slowdown

ABSTRACT
In this paper an attempt is made to answer two questions:
1) What set of factors explains the recent slowdown of the U.S.
aggregate labor productivity, and 2) whether the same set of
forces account for the slowdown of sectoral productivity growth
as well. We specify a model which relates measured labor productivity growth to capital/labor ratio, level and rate of change
of utilization, stock of R & D, and the rate of disembodied
technical change. The model is estimated using sectoral and
aggregate data for the period 1949-1978.

The results of the estimation suggest that the pattern of
aggregate productivity growth can be explained by the growth of
capital/labor ratio the gap between potential and actual output
growth paths, the change in degree of utilization, the growth of
stock of total R & D, and the time trend. In fact, both at the
aggregate and sectoral levels, these factors account fairly well,
first for the growth and then for the subsequent slowdown of labor
productivity in the postwar period. To be sure, in some specific
industries, the performance of the model could be improved. However,
the overall conclusion reached is that the slowdown in growth of
capital formation, the inability of the economy and various sectors
to grow at their normal growth rates, and the slowdown in rate of
technological change are some of the main reasons for the observed
productivity slowdown of the recent years.

The recent dramatic s1cwdcim of the U.S. aggregate prcx5uctivity

growth has been the subject of intensive discussion in the literature.
The causes of this slowdown are difficult to pinpoint, and many factors
may be responsible. However, one source of the slowdown may be the

substantial changes in the industrial canpositicn of outout, rployirent,
capital accumulation, and resource utilization. It is fairly evident
that the slowdown is widespread throughout all sectors of the econamj, but
what is not quite obvious are the factors which have been responsible for

this pervasive phenarenon. Sare available studies attribute the retar—
dation of the aggregate productivity growth to sectoral shi fts in the
ccxrposition of output and errployiient.!" However, the intersectoral

shift in errployrrent can only explain a fraction of the aggregate produc—
tivity slowdown. Also, what is not readily known is the explanation

for the changes in growth of the sectoral productivity.

In this paper, I shall concentrate on two questions: 1) What set of

factors explains, at least partially, the growth of labor productivity
in different sectors during the postwar period? and 2) is the weakening
of the sair set of factors accountable for the slow:1cwn of the sectoral
and aggregate productivity growth since 1973? What follows describes very
brief ly a irodel of labor productivity growth. The model is estimated using
sectoral and aggregate data for the period 1949-1978. The data covers

output, eiTloyrrent, capital stock, stock of R & D, level and rate of change

2.

of utilization rate, and a proxy for diserthxlied technical change.
We conclude fran our analysis that the grcwth rate of capital/labor

ratio, the utilization rate and its rate of change, and the g-rowth
stock of total Research and Develqrrent, go a fair distance in explaining
the pattern of sectoral and aggregate productivity growth. The weakening
of the sarre set of forces is shown to have contributed to the recent

slodcwn in these growth rates.

I.
Before describing our model, it will be useful to note briefly that
during the postwar period, substantial changes have taken place in patterns
of sectoral growth output, erriployrrent, capital stock, and R & D accumula-

tion, and degree
over

of

resource utilization. A brief look at the growth rates

the sub—periods, 1948—55, 1955—65, 1965—73, and 1973—78, indicate

that the sectoral productivity growth rates have been dramatically changing.

3.

growth

rates have been slowed consic1erai1y in all sectors of the econar'

during 1974-78, except in Mining and Transportation. Deceleration of

output growth is also evident in most industries for this period, with
the exception of Corrmunicaticns. This growth rate is even negative in

Construction and Mining. Also, the growth of capital formation in various
Sectors has been reduced substantially, and in sane sectors, the slowdown

is dramatic. Further, it is well documented that the growth of the
stock of R & D has declined by about 2.5 to 3.0% in recent years.

These changes in sectoral growth rates of inputs and outputs over time

have certainly affected productivity growth at the aggregate level. The
results reported here indicate that the recent slowdown of productivity
growth at both sectoral arid aggregate levels can be explained to a
considerable degree by the deceleration of output growth and inadequate

utilization of existing capacity, plus the slowdown of growth of capital/
labor ratio, and the pace of technical change in sane sectors.

II.
The basic model of labor productivity growth is derived fran an
admittedly simple production function--a three-input, Cobb-Douglas

production function with neutral technical changes. The inputs are
capital, labor, and stock of R & D for the period 1948—78. Following
W. Nordhaus,

we have estimated the demand for each sector as a function

of its price relative to the general price level, t!- difference between
actual and normal unemployment rates, and the level of normal aggregate

output, a measure calculated by G.L. Perry '.

The estimated normal demand

for a given sector was then calculated by setting the level of actual employ-

4.

nent

cal to its norrral level. The proucbon

cLicr relates not-mel

ctpt to levels of jrcnhours, sLcs of f5ed capital and,R & D capital,
ax3 a linear tSin—trend. By setting norrral output and norrral aemend to

cialii:y, ssing constant returns—to--scale in prc%3uction, and that the
adjustments of iranhoirs to changes in short-term derand depends & the

level of capacibj utilizatici and to its rate of change, the fol1o-.ing
pro3uctivity equation is cbtained:
-

inP a0 ÷

in )c + (X21n U + :a2 Am

-

+ a4 in R + a5 t

whexe P is the level of output per iranhour, Ic is the ratio of gross capital
stock to iranhours, U is the gap between the rates of groth of actual and
nour.al output, A in U is the change in in. NJ., •R is the stock of R & D,
and t is the time trend. The variable, R, is a measure of the aggregate
stock of R & D develcoed by Xerdrick, which was extended for the peried
•1959—73 using NSF published R & D data..V -

prcductivity equaticn was fitted using the aggregat:e and
sec±oral data for 1949-78. The fit of the equations were very yocd, based
The

on conventional ortexTa. Hcwever, prior to the discussion of the results,
a few reirarks about the problems of estirnaticn seem to be in order. For

scrr Thdustries, we have restricted the capital/labor ratio and the
utilizaticn rate to the saxre coefficients. This was &ne once we observed
that the two sets of coefficients were exactly the same when the variables
were intrcxluoed separately. Hoever, the rrcst troubiescire estirratiori problem

arose in the secLoral equations due to th lticolliiiearity between the
stock of R & D and th tire trend. Sen tire trend was excluded frc. the
reoression, the coefficient of the R & D variable had the correct sian.

and significant magnitude in almost all of the sectoral equations. This
is not surprising. Our maasure of R &

refers to the aggregate level,
and to distinguish between the effects of disodied technical change
D

and the growth of R & D stock in specific sectoral prcxluctivity equations,

what is needed is a rreasure of sector-specific stock of R &

D.

Unfortunately,

except for the period since 1958 for the manufacturing industries, the

necessary data are not available. Another reason may be that if the appro-

priate ireasure of capital, i.e., net capital stock, was used in estimating
the model, the R & D variable could have been statistically significant.
However, for the aggregate econclw, the results indicate that we can distinguish between the effects of stock of R & D arid diseithcxlied technical

change. The magnitudes of the coefficients of stock of R & D and the tine

trend were both statistically significant and positive. They were .06
and .01, respectively, in the agegate econaw productivity equations,
and .10 and .01 in the regression equation for the total private econary.
These estimates are reasonable and consistent with sane previous evidence.

Our results also indicate that the level of productivity at both aggretate and industrial sectors are affected substantially by grcwth of capital/
labor ratio. These results are in contrast to those found by W. Nordhaus
(1972) and G. Perry (1977) and, most recently, L. Thurcw (1979), who did

not find any effect of capital stock on growth of productivity. They
are, however, consistent with results recently reported by P. C1ark.';
Evidently, the coefficients of the capital/labor ratio we have estimated

are slightly greater than the share of capital in each sector or in the
aggregate econany. This can be expected since our Ireasure of capital is

gross capital stock. The unavailability of net capital stock series for
each sector for the entire 1948-78 period rendered the use of gross stock

6.

series necessary.

The coefficients of the short-term variables were also statistically
significant in each equation, which inplies that measured productivity

growth is affected significantly by the level of utilization and its
rate of change. In sate industries, ta in U was not significant, while
in Manufacturing Industries, Trade, Construction, and Public Utilities,

this variable was significant. A nore systematic variable that appeared

in every regression was the level of the utilization rate, suggesting
that an irrortant factor in restraining growth of measured productivity
has been the failure of output to grow fast enough to catch up with its
normal growth rate. Finally, the results indicated that disembodied

technical change affects productivity growth positively and significantly
in each sector except for the three industries which have been experiencing
negative productivity growth since 1973--Mining, Construction, and Public

Utilities.

III.
Given the estimates, we can calculate the contribution of the capital/

labor ratio, the short-term demand variables ,

and

the R & D toward the

slowdown of productivity growth since 1973 in the aggregate econany and

its various sectors. These contributions toward the slowdown of productivity growth in period 1974-7 8 are shown in Table 1. Several aspects

of these results are interesing. The slowdown of capital/labor ratio

growth, and the decline in the utilization rate and its rate of change contribute to the decline of the aggregate ard sectoral productivity growth rates.

The s 1cdcin in arcith of aggregate stock of R & D contributes about one

fourth and one third of the slcdcn of prcduciiivity in total
econciny,
respectively. These estirrates are probably on the high side and could
be frrproved by further refincnt of the data. Hciever,
they clearly
indicate that slc,3c of aggreya labor prcx:luctivity can be
explained
fairly well by the conventional factors.

The xntributians of these factors in explaining sectoral
prcx3uct.ivity
grcth are also significant. In mjst sectors, the entire or large
percentage of productivity grcwth is due to slc3c,wn in grth of capita
labor ratio, degree of utilization, and the retardation of technical

progress in sore industries. In sore sectors like Farming and Services,
the slcc3cwn of prcr3uctivity growth rate is over-explained. In
sectors

the grcTh or retardati of productivity growth has been substantial, far instance, Mining, Thansportation, and Public Utilities, these
set of factors account for a significant portion of the slc'down. In
other sectors sixth as Finance and Cc1rmunicatic, a substantial. residual

remains unexp1aine. It is possible that certain industry-specific
factors like regulatory restriction on Public Utilities, or special
factOrs in the Cc-istructjon industry should he explicitly taken into

account. Also, the strong grow h.of the Carrru.]rli(atjon sector needs
special attention. We have not irade such an effort at this point, but

will do so in the future.
Note that the rnaguites of the contributjbn of grorth of capita]J
labor ratio, the short em utilization rate, and technjcal

progress
vary considerably anDng the various sectors. The estimates of the contri—

bution of capital/labor ratio are probably on the high side, as we no€ed
