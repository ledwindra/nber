The Role of Publication Selection Bias in Estimates of the Value of a Statistical Life

ABSTRACT
Meta-regression estimates of the value of a statistical life (VSL) controlling for publication selection
bias yield bias-corrected estimates of VSL that are higher for labor market studies using the more recent
Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) data. These results are borne out by the findings for
four meta-analysis data sets and different formulations of the variable used to capture publication bias
effects. Meta-regression estimates for a large sample of VSL estimates consisting only of results of
labor market studies using the CFOI fatality data indicate publication selection bias effects that are
not statistically significant in either fixed effects or random effects models with clustered standard
errors. The confidence intervals of the publication bias-corrected estimates of the value of a statistical
life sometimes include the sample mean estimates and always include the values that are currently
used by government agencies.

I. INTRODUCTION
The key parameter used in policy contexts to assess the benefits of policies that reduce
mortality risks is the value of a statistical life (VSL).1 This measure of the risk-money tradeoff
for small risks of death has become the standard approach used by government agencies to value
reductions in mortality risks. The emphasis in the United States is on VSL estimates derived
from labor market studies of VSL based on the tradeoff between wages and worker fatality rates.
Countries such as the U.K. for which the labor market studies are less reliable often rely on
stated preference estimates of VSL.
Typically, U.S. government agencies draw on the results of different studies in deriving
their VSL estimate for policy. In some cases, this procedure has involved averaging the results
across studies based on a survey of the literature or a meta-analysis, while in others the agency
has used the results of a meta-regression analysis to control for different variables that may affect
the estimated VSL, such as the average income of the sample. Among the meta-regression
analyses that have been relied upon by U.S. government agencies in recent years are those by
Mrozek and Taylor (2002), Viscusi and Aldy (2003), and Kochi, Hubbell, and Kramer (2006).
Agencies also may refer to more than one meta-regression analysis as the basis for its VSL
estimate. These meta-regression analyses serve to combine the results of different VSL
estimates and to facilitate adjustments in the VSL to tailor the results to the particular
populations whose preferences are being valued by, for example, controlling for the different
countries for which the estimates have been derived.

Viscusi (2014) presents an inventory of 98 government regulations and the associated VSL used to assess the
policy impacts. The most frequently represented agencies are the Environmental Protection Agency, the Dept. of
Transportation, and the Food and Drug Administration. Ashenfelter (2006) also stresses the broad policy
applicability of the VSL estimates.

1

An additional factor that can be taken into account through meta-regression analyses is
controlling for the effect of publication bias (Stanley and Doucouliagos 2012). Publication
selection bias could result from either the selection of estimates that the researcher chooses to
report or to the unwillingness of peer reviewed journals to publish results outside the
conventional range of VSL estimates or which appear to be implausible. Guided by economic
theory, researchers may be reluctant to report negative estimates for VSL, which are inconsistent
with the basic theory of compensating differentials that jobs posing higher levels of risk will only
be attractive to workers if these jobs provide additional pay. There also may be biases in the
opposite direction as several early estimates of the VSL were based on labor market studies
using the Society of Actuaries mortality data for people in different occupations, as opposed to
the occupation-specific risk. Use of the Society of Actuaries data as a proxy for the worker’s
job-related risk overstated the average job-related fatality rate by an order of magnitude and led
to very low estimates of VSL, which potentially induced an anchoring bias in terms of estimates
that researchers viewed as being reasonable.
There have been more meta-analyses of VSL than any other economic subject, and this
interest in turn has stimulated two studies of the effects of publication selection bias on VSL.
These explorations of the role of publication bias with respect to VSL have indicated that such
biases are statistically significant and could have a fundamental effect on the estimated VSL.
Doucouliagos, Stanley, and Giles (2012) estimated the effect of publication bias on labor market
estimates of the VSL and found that correction for publication selection bias reduces the
estimated VSL by 70-80 percent. Making such an adjustment for policy assessments could
dramatically reduce the assessed benefits of reduced mortality risks. This quite substantial
estimated publication selection bias effect will be examined in my analysis below. The similar

2

meta-regression analysis of the effect of publication selection bias on the estimated income
elasticity of VSL by Doucouliagos, Stanley, and Viscusi (2014) likewise found estimates of
statistically significant publication bias. However, while the estimates of the bias-corrected
income elasticity of VSL were below the mean income elasticity estimate in the literature, they
were similar to the meta-regression analysis range in Viscusi and Aldy (2003) in which there was
no correction for publication selection effects.
A principal theme of this article is that much of the role of the publication selection bias
can be traced to studies based on earlier eras of fatality rate data. The available U.S.
occupational fatality rate measures have evolved from voluntary reporting of fatalities to the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BSL), to reliance on fatality rates based on partial samples of the
working population, and most recently, to the use of a comprehensive Census of Fatal
Occupational Injuries (CFOI) undertaken by the BLS. The CFOI is a comprehensive census of
all worker fatalities. Construction of the CFOI requires that the BLS validate every fatality as
being job-related using multiple data sources such as death certificates, workers’ compensation
records, and coroners’ reports.
Because the CFOI data consist of individual records of fatalities, researchers have used it
to construct much more precise measures of the fatality rate that can be matched to the worker in
the employment sample. Whereas previous BLS job fatality data pertained to average fatality
rates by industry, it is now possible to construct fatality rates by very refined dimensions such as
industry, occupation, age, gender, race, and immigrant status.2 For example, some studies have
constructed a fatality rate stratified by 50 industries and by 10 occupations so that both industry
and occupational variations in the fatality rate are taken into account. Using multiple years of

2

Viscusi (2013) reviews these studies using CFOI data and the different dimensions on which the article constructed
the fatality rate and matched it to the worker.

3

CFOI data to have an adequate sample size, it is feasible to construct risk estimates for such
narrowly defined categories. Most previous labor market studies of VSL before the advent of the
CFOI data relied on industry level data and, in effect, assumed all jobs within an industry were
equally risky.
In recognition of the superiority of the CFOI fatality rate measure in estimates of the
VSL, the U.S. Dept. of Transportation (2013) has adopted for policy evaluation purposes an
average of VSL estimates from nine labor market studies based on the CFOI data rather than
relying on a meta-regression analysis including studies based on less reliable risk measures. As
this paper will demonstrate, VSL estimates derived using the CFOI data will exhibit a differing
performance with respect to estimates of publication selection bias as well.
Section II introduces the four data sets used in the aggregate level meta-regression
analysis. To maintain comparability to Doucouliagos, Stanley, and Giles (2012) and
Doucouliagos, Stanley, and Viscusi (2014), I use the meta-regression sample of Bellavance,
Dionne, and Lebeau (2009) as the starting point in my analysis, but I also augment this sample
with different samples of additional studies. The meta-regression estimates in Section III
indicate a statistically significant publication selection bias effect, but the estimated VSL after
adjusting for this bias is much greater for studies using the CFOI data. In Section IV I construct
a new data set based on a large sample of individual regression results using the CFOI data. The
magnitude and statistical significance of publication selection bias varies across the different
specifications and is not statistically significant based on models with clustered standard errors
and including either fixed effects or random effects. In all specifications, the extent of the bias
for the CFOI is well below the 70-80 percent publication bias estimate found by Doucouliagos,
Stanley, and Giles (2012) for VSL studies. The main result is that the publication-bias corrected

4

estimates using the CFOI data are very similar to the estimated values that are relied on for
policy purposes.

II. AGGREGATE META-ANALYSIS DATA SETS
The first set of examination of the role of publication selection bias will utilize four data
sets. Each of these data sets is based on a “best-set” approach in that a best or preferred single
estimate from each study is generally used. Sample 1 is the Bellavance, Dionne, and Lebeau
(2009) meta-regression analysis sample used in the publication selection bias analysis of
Doucouliagos, Stanley, and Giles (2012) and Doucouliagos, Stanley, and Viscusi (2014). That
sample consists of 39 VSL estimates drawn from 37 different studies. Sample 2 augments
Sample 1 by including estimates from 14 VSL studies using the estimates from studies using the
CFOI data that were not included in Sample 1. The additional estimates incorporated in the
sample are all based on the semi-logarithmic wage equation estimates using the author’s
preferred specification. Sample 3 adds to Sample 2 the six studies that were included in the
meta-analysis of labor market estimates in Viscusi and Aldy (2003) but which are not already
included in Sample 2. Finally, Sample 4 restricts Sample 3 to only those studies using U.S. data,
leading to a sample size of 39.
Table 1 summarizes the sample characteristics for the variables that will play some role
in the analysis. The average of the VSL estimates ranges from $10 million for Sample 4 to $12
million for Samples 1-3, where all estimates in this article are in $2010 based on the CPI-U. Due
to the skewed nature of the distribution, the sample mean is above the median VSL of $8.9
million ($2010) in the meta-analysis in Viscusi and Aldy (2003). Interestingly, the lowest
observed VSL estimates among the four samples considered here are for the U.S. Sample 4

5

notwithstanding the positive income elasticity of VSL. This result is not too surprising in that
the explanatory variables included in the U.S. analyses are often more comprehensive including,
for example, a measure of workers’ compensation benefits and the nonfatal injury rate, each of
which may affect the estimated compensation for fatality risks.
The two variables that will be used to capture publication selection bias effects are the
standard error (Std. Error) and the Variance of the VSL estimates. The average standard errors
of the VSL estimates are about one-third of the size of the VSL estimates for all four samples.
Three other variables will be included in various regression analyses. The most
important of these is CFOI, which is an indicator variable that takes on a value of 1 for VSL
estimates based on CFOI fatality rate data, and 0 otherwise. The share of studies in the different
samples relying on CFOI data ranges from a low of 8 percent for Sample 1 to a high of 44
percent for Sample 4, with Samples 2 and 3 being intermediate cases with just under one-third of
the studies based on CFOI data. The Ln Income variable is the natural log of the sample’s
average income level. Workers’ Compensation is an indicator variable that takes on a value of 1
if the wage equation included a workers’ compensation variable, and 0 otherwise. About onefifth of the studies controlled for the effect of Workers’ Compensation on wages.
One can obtain a general sense of the possible presence of a publication selection bias by
considering a funnel plot of the VSL estimates in which the precision of the estimate (the inverse
of the standard error) is on the vertical axis and the VSL (in millions of $2010) is on the
horizontal axis. Meta-regression analyses of VSL generally assume that the estimates reported
are an unbiased sample. If there is no publication bias and the assumptions underlying the
regression model are satisfied, the estimates should be independent of their standard error and
should be symmetrically distributed around the mean estimated value. This property is best

6

suited to analyzing situations in which there is a single true population parameter. The funnel
plot approach excludes the influence of other factors in the analysis that may influence the
estimates such as the presence of substantial heterogeneity in the levels of VSL across the
different samples. The shape of the distribution should be similar to that of an inverted funnel if
there are no selection effects or reporting biases.
Figure 1 presents a funnel plot of VSL estimates for Sample 3. The circles indicate
estimates based on the CFOI data, and the triangles indicate estimates using other fatality rate
data. The funnel plot is highly skewed, with the outliers in terms of both precision and size of
the VSL estimates being from studies that did not use the CFOI data. The non-CFOI studies
have estimates along the vertical axis with low VSL and high precision as well as estimates
along the horizontal axis with low precision and high VSL. The very low estimates of VSL are
the most precisely estimated. The CFOI estimates are more tightly clustered with more moderate
levels of precision and less extreme VSL estimates. Notably, the distribution of VSL estimates is
truncated as none of the estimates is negative, which is consistent with the theory of
compensation differentials. However, given the pattern of VSL estimates that are often clustered
along the vertical axis, one would have expected similar clustering for negative values if
negative values had not been selectively screened out.
Best-set sample analyses are not well-suited to analyzing the possibility of negative VSL
estimates. The emphasis of the best-set sample approach is on the author’s preferred
specification. This approach will tend truncate the distribution and omit any negative VSL
estimates, as negative VSL results are unlikely to be an economist’s chosen specification.
However, the all-set CFOI sample in Section IV that utilizes a comprehensive set of regression
results finds that negative VSL estimates sometimes are published despite being inconsistent

7

with theoretical predictions. Similarly, the underlying studies that comprise the Bellavance et al.
(2009) sample likewise include some negative values.

III. META-REGRESSION ESTIMATES OF PUBLICATION SELECTION BIAS
The tests for publication bias will involve a series of different regressions involving a
similar methodology where these models adhere to the accepted norms for meta-regression
analyses of publication selection effects (Stanley and Doucouliagos 2012). In the basic model in
which the Std. Error is included in the equation to account for publication selection bias, the
equation takes the form:
VSLi = α0 + α1 Std. Errori + εi.

(1)

A statistically significant estimate of α1 is evidence of publication selection effects in that
the reported VSL estimates are correlated with the estimated Std. Error as opposed to having a
symmetrically distributed funnel plot. This coefficient is the regression analysis counterpart of
the funnel asymmetry test. The estimated VSL after adjusting for publication selection effects is
given by the constant term α0. Thus, as the Std. Error goes to zero, the constant term equals the
expected value of VSL corrected for publication selection effects.
One can undertake a similar analysis using the Variance of the VSL estimate rather than
the Std. Error. Simulation studies suggest that the inclusion of the Variance in the equation is a
preferable correction for the role of publication selection effects (Stanley and Doucouliagos
2012). The Variance counterpart to equation 1 takes the form:
VSLi = β0 + β1 Variancei + ei.

8

(2)

As in the case of equation 1 using the Std. Error, the coefficient β1 reflects the influence
of publication selection effects. The constant term β0 is the estimated VSL corrected for
publication selection effects.
To capture the potential effect of the CFOI fatality rate data on estimates of the VSL, I
explore two additional specifications in which the CFOI variable is also included:
VSLi = α0′ + α1′ Std. Errori + α2′ CFOIi + εi′

(3)

VSLi = β0′ + β1′ Variancei + β2′ CFOIi + ei′.

(4)

and

The coefficients α1′ and β1′ reflect the influence of publication selection effects.
Similarly, the constant terms α0′ and β0′ will correspond to the estimated average VSL
controlling for both publication bias and the use of CFOI data. One can readily calculate this
average VSL estimate and its confidence interval based on the estimated constant term and its
standard error. However, my main interest here is whether the use of CFOI data affects the
estimated VSL after accounting for publication bias effects. In particular, are α2′ and β2′
statistically significant, and how do they influence the average VSL? Conditional on using the
much more reliable CFOI data, what is the estimated VSL? That mean value is given by α0′ + α2′
for the Std. Error formulation and by β0′ + β2′ for the variance formulation. When reporting the
VSL and its confidence interval for the equations including the CFOI variable I will do so for
estimates in which the CFOI variable take on a value of 1 and publication selection effects are
set equal to zero.
The errors associated with the different VSL estimates are likely to exhibit substantial
heterogeneity. As a result, the estimates of equations 1 – 4 will utilize a weighted least squares
(WLS) model using the inverse of the variance of each of the VSL estimates as the weights.

9

This approach is known as the precision-effect estimate with standard error (Stanley and
Doucouliagos 2012).
Table 2 reports the estimates of the Standard Error versions of the model in equation 1
and equation 3 for each of the four samples. In every instance there is evidence of statistically
significant publication bias effects. These biases are all positive, indicating that the effect of the
bias is to boost the estimated VSL. The magnitudes of the coefficients of the Std. Error terms
range from 3.2 to 3.4 in Panel A and from 2.9 to 3.1 in Panel B. The size of the publication bias
effect is noteworthy since a coefficient of 2 or more in the Std. Error version of the model is
generally viewed as a sign of substantial publication bias (Doucougliagos, Stanley, and Giles
2012).
The mean estimates of the VSL implied by the constant terms in the four equations in
Panel A of Table 2 all indicate a VSL on the order of $1 million, about an order of magnitude
below the mean values for each sample in Table 1. The findings in Panel B of Table 2 likewise
indicate publication bias effects that have somewhat smaller point estimates than in Panel A.
The constant term estimates remain in a similar range around $1 million except for Sample 4 for
which the constant term is small and not statistically significant. Notably the CFOI variable is
strongly significant in all instances, implying a CFOI premium above the average publication
bias-adjusted VSL of $2.5 million for Sample 1 to $4.1 million for the U.S. sample of studies in
Sample 4.
The 95 percent confidence intervals (CI) for VSL at the bottom of each panel in Table 2
do not include the average VSL for each of the samples. However, in the case of estimates based
on the CFOI data in Panel B of Table 2 the upper end of the confidence intervals is higher than in

10

Panel A and closer to many estimates of VSL in the literature, as it is in the $5 million to $6
million range.
The counterpart estimates of equations 2 and 4 based on the Variance rather than the Std.
Error appear in Table 3. These values, which are the empirically preferred estimates based on
studies of the relative performance of Std. Error and Variance approaches to capturing
publication selection effects, consistently indicate a strong publication bias effect in every
equation. However, the constant terms that reflect the average VSL excluding the role of all
other variables in the equation are larger in Table 3 than in Table 2. For Panel A these average
VSL amounts range from $2.1 million in Sample 1 to $3.7 million in Sample 4. These
differences in the constant terms in Panel A can be traced to the greater share of CFOI estimates
in some of the samples, particularly Sample 4. The intercepts reported for the Panel B equations
that include the CFOI variable are tightly clustered in the $1.8 million - $1.9 million range. The
CFOI variables are positive and all strongly statistically significant, with the average CFOI
premium ranging from $3.9 million - $4.7 million.
The estimated VSL levels based on the Variance versions of the models are greater than
the VSL estimates for the Std. Error models in Table 2. The Panel A estimates in Table 3 imply
average VSL amounts of $2 million to $4 million, with a high of $6 million for the upper end of
the confidence interval for Sample 4. However, after accounting for the influence of CFOI
estimates in Panel B of Table 3, the mean of the VSL estimates is in the $6 million to $7 million
range, which still reflects substantial publication bias effects, but the extent of the bias is less
than in Panel A. The upper ends of the VSL confidence intervals are $8 million to $9 million,
which remain below the sample means but are much closer to these values than the overall
effects from Panel A.

11

The final set of regression estimates using these four samples includes several different
explanatory variables. In particular, I add the Ln Income of the sample and whether the study
included a Workers’ Compensation variable. The Ln Income variable should have a positive
effect due to the positive income elasticity of VSL, and Workers’ Compensation should have a
negative effect as this form of insurance coverage reduces wage premiums for risk. These
equations differ from those reported in Table 3 of Doucouliagos, Stanley, and Giles (2012) in
that instead of a time trend variable I include the CFOI indicator. Thus, the effect of the CFOI
variable is broken out separately, and the average effects on the intercept of all previous eras of
fatality rate data are reflected in the constant term.
The rationale for distinguishing CFOI apart from a temporal trend is that the role of the
temporal trend is that the studies have become refined over time, particularly in terms of the
fatality rate data that they use. There have been several improvements in the fatality rate data
that influence the VSL. Consider, for example, the effect on the VSL of the transition from the
early BLS industry fatality rate data to the National Traumatic Occupational Fatality data, which
was a precursor to the CFOI data developed by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and
Health. Use of this newer fatality rate variable alone led to a doubling of the estimated VSL
based on estimates of otherwise identical equations, due to the reduction in the amount of
measurement error in the fatality rate variable (Moore and Viscusi 1988). Indeed, the important
role of measurement error in the fatality rate measure had been a prominent, long-standing theme
in the VSL literature dealing with studies in the pre-CFOI era.3
The estimated VSL and the associated confidence intervals shown in the bottom rows of
Panel A and Panel B of Table 4 are all constructed after setting the publication bias term equal to
3

See, for example, the discussion in Moore and Viscusi (1988), Black and Kniesner (2003), and Ashenfelter (2006).
These critiques either predated the use of CFOI data in labor market estimates of VSL or were not aware of the
CFOI data and did not include the CFOI-based studies in the critique.

12

zero, the value of CFOI equal to 1, and with all other variables evaluated at their mean values for
the sample. The mean VSL estimates range from $4 million to $5 million for the Std. Error
formulations of the model in Panel A of Table 4 to a range from $7 million to $8 million for the
Variance version. The broadest confidence intervals for the VSL estimates are for Sample 1, for
which the range is from $2 million to $8 million for the Std. Error formulation, and from $5
million to $12 million for the Variance formulation. The narrowest confidence interval range is
for the U.S. Sample 4, where the range is $3 million to $5 million for the Std. Error formulation
and $5 million to $8 million for the model in which the Variance is used to capture publication
bias selection effects. The role of publication selection bias is statistically significant and
reduces the VSL, but the VSL estimates based on CFOI data are at levels more similar to the
observed distribution in the literature.

IV. PUBLICATION SELECTION BIAS ESTIMATES FOR A SAMPLES OF CFOI STUDIES
Given the difference in the publication bias-corrected estimates of the VSL for the studies
based on the CFOI data, it is useful to explore the role of publication bias using a sample
consisting of only studies that utilized the CFOI data. However, rather than focusing on a single
preferred estimate from each study, I include a comprehensive set of regression estimates, thus
avoiding any selection effects in terms of which estimates are included in the meta-regression
analysis. Unlike the best-set approach, this “all-set” sample incorporates the entire range of
estimates from a particular study and their heterogeneity. The resulting sample consists of 487
observations drawn from 15 different studies. The Appendix summarizes the list of the studies
used in this analysis and the procedure for constructing this sample. The estimated VSL for the

13

CFOI sample is fairly similar to that for Samples 1-4, with a mean value of $14.013 million and
a standard error of $6.246 million.
Figure 2 provides the funnel plot of the VSL estimates for the CFOI sample. There is
some positive skewness in the distribution, as there was in Figure 1, but much of the distribution
exhibits more of a reasonable funnel shape than in Figure 1. The large number of estimates in
the $5 million to $15 million VSL range displays a funnel-shaped distribution. The estimates in
this range also exhibit the greatest precision. Unlike Figure 1 in which there were no negative
VSL estimates, Figure 2 includes several negative values. There is also less clustering of
estimates along the vertical axis than in Figure 1, as there are fewer outliers observed in Figure 2
in terms of estimates with very low VSL and high precision. Nevertheless, the distribution of
VSL estimates is positively skewed as many of the more extreme estimates in Figure 2 stem
from unique aspects of the particular studies, which we will account for in the statistical analysis.
The principal outliers that induce skewness in the distribution are the large positive estimates that
are also coupled with relatively low levels of precision.
The CFOI sample analysis includes estimates of several different models for both the Std.
Error and the Variance formulations of the model. The first equation to be estimated is the basic
equation 1 for Std. Error and equation 3 for Variance, using a WLS approach. Because there are
multiple observations for any particular study, in brackets we report the pertinent clustered
standard errors where the errors are clustered on the particular article. The robust standard errors
are reported in parentheses. All coefficient estimates and the associated confidence intervals that
are reported for this sample include both the robust standard errors as well as the clustered
standard errors.

14

The second estimation approach is a fixed effects model including fixed effects for the
different articles s in the sample. This approach captures the article-specific factors that
influence the average estimated VSL for the sample. These influences include differences in
sample composition as well as differences in econometric specification. Thus, we report fixed
effects estimates for the Std. Error model of the equation for this unbalanced panel, given by
VSLis = α0′′ + α1′′ Std. Erroris + as + εis

(5)

and for the Variance model we estimate
VSLis = β0′′ + β1′′ Varianceis + bs + eis.

(6)

We also estimate each of these equations using a random effects framework where the articlespecific intercepts as and bs are random effects in the model rather than fixed effects.
Although both fixed effects and random effects models are reported below, based on the
Hausman test one can reject the hypothesis that the article-specific effects are uncorrelated with
the other regressors in the equation. The differences between the coefficients in the models are
strongly statistically significant at the 0.000 level for the Std. Error model and at the 0.002 level
for the Variance model. Thus, for this sample the fixed effects model estimates are consistent,
but the random effects model estimates are not.
Table 5 reports the estimation results for the Std. Error models in Panel A and the
Variance models in Panel B. For both the Std. Error and Variance specifications based on WLS,
the publication selection bias terms are statistically significant and positive, as in the previous
estimates based on more aggregative data. The magnitudes of the publication bias effects are
considerably diminished. For the estimates in Panel A the coefficients of the Std. Error term
range from 0.3 to 0.7, whereas the earlier results were about one and half time the size of the
coefficient level of 2 that is a sign of substantial publication bias. For the estimates utilizing

15

either a fixed effects or a random effects model, the publication bias terms are no longer
statistically significant based on the clustered standard errors that account for the multiple
observations per article.
The intercept terms, which are the estimates of the VSL after accounting for the influence
of publication selection bias, are about an order of magnitude greater than the earlier results for
the Std. Error model estimates in Table 2 and at least five times greater than the intercepts for the
Variance model estimates in Table 3. The mean estimated VSL based on the Std. Error models
ranges from $9 million to $12 million, and for the Variance model the estimates are from $9
million to $14 million. The upper ends of the confidence intervals reach a high value of $16
million for the fixed effects Std. Error model and $15 million for the fixed effects Variance
model.
The adjustments for article-specific differences using either a fixed effects or a random
effects model lead to higher estimates of VSL than the WLS results. In the case of the Variance
specifications, the confidence interval for the VSL based on the WLS estimates lies below and
does not overlap with the confidence intervals based on either the fixed effects or random effects
model.
The reduction in the mean value of VSL from the sample mean of $14 million to the
levels shown in Table 5 produces estimated values of the VSL similar to those used by
government agencies based on the most reliable estimates. The publication bias selection
adjustment and the accounting for article-specific differences dampen the influence of some of
the more extreme outliers. For example, the VSL estimates exploiting the panel data aspect of
the Panel Study of Income Dynamics reported in Kniesner et al. (2012) are considerably smaller
than the overall estimates using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics in Kniesner, Viscusi, and

16

Ziliak (2006) in which there is no accounting for worker-specific effects. Thus, the publicationcorrected estimates of the VSL lie in a quite reasonable range based on the characteristics of the
studies.

V. CONCLUSION
These findings indicate a potentially statistically significant role of publication bias in
estimates of the value of a statistical life. The bias adjustment may be quite substantial. This
result holds for the best-set samples based on individual estimates from a large series of studies
as well as in some specifications for the all-set sample of regression results based solely on the
CFOI fatality rate data. However, the clustered standard error results for the all-set estimates
using either fixed effects or random effects models based on studies relying on the CFOI data do
not indicate statistically significant publication bias effects.
In assessing the implications of the meta-regression analyses for estimates of VSL, the
role of different eras of fatality rate data is consequential. The estimates for four different
samples of studies found that there was a CFOI premium of $2 million - $4 million for the Std.
Error model estimates and $4 million - $5 million for the Variance model estimates. These
higher values are consistent with the reduced measurement error associated with the CFOI data.
The estimates based solely on the individual regression results utilizing individual
regression estimates and the CFOI data generate larger VSL estimates than the results of the
more broadly based best-set samples. The estimated mean values are $9 million - $12 million
for the Std. Error equations and $9 million to $14 million for the Variance equations, which are
below the sample mean estimate of the VSL using the CFOI data of $14 million. However, the
estimated publication-bias corrected estimates of VSL are very similar to or somewhat above the

17

$9.1 million level for VSL adopted for policy assessment purposes by the U.S. Dept. of
Transportation (2013) based on its review of a series of VSL studies using CFOI data. An
inventory by Viscusi (2014) of the VSL amounts used from 1985 to 2013 in 98 U.S. regulatory
impact analyses found that agencies employed levels of VSL that ranged from $1.2 million to
$9.6 million in $2010. Early policy assessments of the VSL were at the low end of this range,
and more recent policy values have been at or near the upper end of that range. Even these high
levels that have been used for policy purposes are consistent with the mean publication-bias
corrected estimates of VSL based on the CFOI data.
The confidence intervals for the estimated VSL based on the CFOI data are reasonably
tight, but they sometimes include the average VSL amount for the entire sample. Nevertheless,
the publication-bias corrected estimates of VSL for the CFOI sample produces estimates more in
line with the average VSL levels that are generated once high estimate outliers are excluded.
Accounting for publication selection effects reduces the VSL to the levels that are consistent
with the studies in the literature that are generally viewed as most reliable based on their
econometric approach.

Appendix. Description of the CFOI Data Set
The CFOI sample is based on the individual regression results reported in 15 articles. A
detailed review of the characteristics of these CFOI studies appears in Viscusi (2013). The
sample included VSL estimates from the following articles: Aldy and Viscusi (2008), Evans and
Schaur (2010), Hersch and Viscusi (2010), Kniesner and Viscusi (2005), Kniesner et al. (2012),
Kniesner, Viscusi, and Ziliak (2006, 2010, 2014), Scotton (2013), Scotton and Taylor (2011),
Viscusi (2003, 2004 2013), Viscusi and Aldy (2007), and Viscusi and Hersch (2008). Note that
the VSL estimates have been transformed to 2010 dollars using the CPI-U.
In some cases, the paper did not include information that made it possible to calculate the
standard error (SE) of the VSL. In the case of Kniesner and Viscusi (2005), and estimates in
Kniesner et al. (2012), the procedure used followed that of Bellavance, Dionne, and Lebeau
(2009). The first stage involves an OLS regression of SE(VSL) on sample size. Based on saving
the constant term (α) and the coefficient of sample size (β), the SE(VSL) is calculated based on
the equation: SE(VSL) = VSLx[α + β sample size].
One estimate of $158 million VSL ($2010) from Scotton and Taylor (2011) was excluded
because it pertained only to a specific, narrowly defined class of fatalities--homicides to
transportation drivers—rather than typical job accidents affecting a broad class of workers. Two
studies—Leeth and Ruser (2003) and Kochi and Taylor (2011)—were excluded because of the
infeasibility of constructing standard errors for the VSL.
