ABSTRACT
Exchange rate policies depend on portfolio choices, and portfolio choices depend on anticipated
exchange rate policies. This opens the door to multiple equilibria in policy regimes. We construct
a model in which agents optimally choose to denominiate their assests and liabilites either in
domestic or in foreign currency. The monetary authority optimally chooses to float or to fix the
currency, after portfolios have been chosen. We identify conditions under which both fixing and
floating are equilibrium policies: if agents expect fixing and arrange their portfolios accordingly, the
monetary authority validates that expectation; the same happens if agents initially expect floating.
We also show that a flexible exchange rate Pareto-dominates a fixed one. It follows that social
welfare would rise if the monetary authority could precommit to floating.

Introduction

Emerging market countries have trouble letting their exchange rates ßoat, and
many countries that claim to ßoat do not deliver on that promise. That is the
conclusion of much recent empirical work, starting with Calvo and Reinhart
(2002) and Stein et al. (1999). The reason, these papers argue,1 is a lethal
mix of dollarization of liabilities and balance sheet eﬀects: if corporate debts
are denominated in dollars while Þrms depend on local currency revenues (or,
more precisely, corporate revenues increase with the relative price of goods produced at home), sharp and unexpected changes in relative prices are harmful
to Þnancial stability. The policy conclusion is that ßexible exchange rates can
be destabilizing, and therefore emerging market nations would be well advised
to design alternative monetary arrangements, including currency boards and
dollarization.
Such a view has become extremely inßuential, but even its most ardent
advocates understand that it is only half the story. The claim is that ßoating is
not feasible given that debts are dollarized. But, presumably, borrowers choose
the amounts of debt to issue as peso and dollar-denominated bonds taking
into account the risk-return characteristics of these securities. Recognizing that
variances and covariances (especially with consumption) should then matter, Ize
and Levy-Yeyati (2003), Ize and Parrado (2003), and Morón and Castro (2003)
have extended standard portfolio theory to model endogenous dollarization in
emerging markets. Their approach, however, takes as given the structure of
shocks and, more importantly for our purposes, monetary and exchange rate
policies.
So the recent debate has emphasized that exchange rate policies depend on
portfolio choices, and also that portfolio choices depend on anticipated exchange
rate policies. The next question is inevitable: what are the implications of this
interaction once both portfolios and exchange rate policy are endogenous? In
particular, what are the resulting policy outcomes? Is there a single outcome,
or several ones? These are the issues that this paper focuses on.
We build an extremely simple model of a small open economy in which domestic residents can borrow internationally by issuing bonds denominated in
both home and foreign currency. The currency composition of debt plays a
nontrivial role because markets are incomplete: bonds are promises to nominal
payoﬀs that can only imperfectly (or not at all) depend on the realization of the
state of nature. We also assume sticky wages. Then monetary and exchange rate
policy matters through two channels: as in textbook models, in the presence of
external shocks, ßexible exchange rates stabilize labor supply and output at the
expense of making the real exchange rate more volatile; and, as emphasized in
the more recent literature, unexpected changes in the real exchange rate may
aﬀect wealth and exacerbate the volatility of domestic consumption, if domestic
residents are long in one currency and short in the other. As a consequence,
the optimal exchange rate policy chosen by a benevolent central bank depends

2

on the existence and extent of currency mismatches. But the latter are determined, in turn, by the optimizing decisions of domestic borrowers and, hence,
by expectations of exchange rate policy.
The equilibrium outcome of this interaction is an exchange rate regime and a
market allocation such that the market allocation is a competitive equilibrium
given the exchange rate regime, and the central bank cannot increase social
welfare by deviating to a diﬀerent exchange regime. We assume that the central
bank chooses the exchange rate regime (whether to Þx the nominal exchange
rate or to Þx the domestic price level and let the exchange rate ßoat) after
debts and wage contracts have been written. Then market expectations about
exchange rate policy play a crucial role in shaping equilibria.
If bonds are non-contingent promises to either home or foreign currency, we
Þnd there is always an equilibrium with ßoating exchange rates. So, if agents
expect the central bank will ßoat, they arrange their wage and debt contracts
accordingly; given that, the central bank indeed Þnds it optimal to ßoat. But
in some cases there is also an equilibrium with Þxed exchange rates: if agents
expect Þxed rates, they choose wages and portfolios that make it optimal for
the central bank to Þx ex post. That is, we can have multiple equilibria in policy
regimes.
When there are multiple equilibria, they can be Pareto-ranked. We show
that, if utility functions are quadratic or display constant relative risk aversion,
the equilibrium involving ßexible rates yields higher expected welfare. So if
the economy is in a situation in which there are two equilibrium policy regimes,
and arbitrary expectations cause the Þxed rates equilibrium to materialize, then
expected welfare will be ineﬃciently low. Welfare would increase if the central
bank could precommit to ßoat the currency, regardless of the composition of
agents’ portfolios.
We also study the case in which domestic bonds are indexed to the price of
home output. Equilibrium policy regimes turn out to be harder to pin down.
Still, under some further assumptions we are able to identify conditions for Þxed
rates and ßexible rates to be equilibrium policy regimes. Again, there is a range
of parameters for which both regimes occur in equilibrium. In those cases, a
policy of ßexible rates again delivers higher expected welfare than do Þxed rates.
Our discussion is close in spirit to that in Chamon and Hausmann (2002). In
that paper, if domestic Þrms have large dollar liabilities, unexpected changes in
the real exchange rate can drive the Þrms into costly bankruptcy. The central
bank can react to shocks by allowing the interest rate or the exchange rate
to move. If domestic Þrms expect a policy of stable exchange rates they will
borrow in dollars, which ex post may cause the monetary authority to validate
such expectations for fear of bankrupting the Þrms. Hence one can have more
than one equilibrium policy.
Self-validating policy regimes also appear in Corsetti and Pesenti (2002), but
in a very diﬀerent setting. That paper studies price-setting by Þrms and the
choice of monetary policy by the government. There can be two equilibria. In
one, Þrms preset prices in domestic currency only, and foreign-currency prices
are determined by the law of one price. Floating exchange rates are then the
3

optimal policy regime. In the second equilibrium Þrms preset prices in local
currency, and a monetary union is the optimal policy choice.
Our policy message here is similar to that in Caballero and Krishnamurty
(2004), who analyze a model in which Þnancial market imperfections lead agents
to under-provide insurance against liquidity shocks. In that model ßoating the
exchange rate is powerless to ameliorate shocks once the quantity of insurance
has been chosen, but can help ex ante to induce agents to take greater precautions against shocks. Hence Caballero and Krishnamurty also argue for
precommitting to a ßoat, though for reasons very diﬀerent from ours.
The next section outlines the basic model, and section 3 presents the basic
results. Section 4 extends the analysis to the case in which peso bonds are
indexed, while section 5 concludes. Some technical material is delayed to an
appendix.

2

The model

Consider a single-period, small open economy populated by households and
Þrms. The representative household owns the typical Þrm and receives its profits.
There are two goods, one produced at home and one produced abroad. The
two goods are imperfect substitutes and both tradable. For simplicity, we assume that domestic households consume only the foreign good.
There is a domestic currency, called peso, which is issued by a domestic
central bank. There is also a foreign currency called dollar. Foreign goods have
a constant price of one in terms of dollars, so we speak indistinctly of dollars
and foreign goods.
To Þnance operations, at the beginning of the period under study home Þrms
borrow from the world market, here represented by a continuum of risk-neutral
lenders. The key assumption in this section is that the typical Þrm can borrow
or lend in pesos or dollars. Therefore, the Þrm’s optimal borrowing policy
determines the degree of “dollarization” in the economy, and will be inßuenced
by the Þrm’s expectations about equilibrium prices and the exchange rate. The
latter are determined by the monetary policy chosen by the central bank, which
in turn takes into account the degree of dollarization.

2.1

Firms

The representative Þrm has access to the technology
Y = AK α L1−α

(1)

where 0 < α < 1 and A is a positive parameter. For simplicity, we also assume
that the capital stock K is of Þxed size. Households are heterogeneous in the
labor services they provide, and the input L is an aggregate of the services of

4

the diﬀerent households in the economy:

¸ θ−1
θ−1
L=

,
0

where we have indexed workers by i in the unit interval, Li denotes the services
purchased from household i, and θ > 1 is the elasticity of demand for household
i’s services.
Let Wi denote the wage charged by worker i and W denote the aggregate
wage, that is, the minimum cost of a unit of the L aggregate, expressed in terms
of pesos. Cost minimization yields the demand for household i0 s labor:
µ ¶−θ
Wi
L
(2)
Li =
W

The Þrm has no capital to start with, so it must Þnance capital purchases
by borrowing abroad. To do this, at the beginning of the period, the Þrm sells
bonds denominated either in pesos (B) or dollars (B ∗ ). A peso (resp. dollar)
bond is a promise to a peso (resp. dollar) at the end of the period. Note that,
in assuming that bond payments cannot be arbitrary functions of the state of
nature, we are imposing market incompleteness, which implies that currency
composition plays a nontrivial role.
We assume that the world interest rate in dollars is zero, so a dollar bond
must sell for one dollar. Letting Q denote the price in dollars of a peso bond, it
follows that
(3)
QB + B ∗ = K,
End of period Þrm proÞts, in dollars, are denoted by Π and given by
SΠ = P Y − W L − SB ∗ − B,

(4)
where S is the exchange rate (in pesos per dollar) and P the peso price of home
output. As usual, we assume that L is chosen at the end of the period, after
uncertainty has been revealed.
Since the Þrm is owned by the representative household, it is natural to
assume its objective function be E {u0 (C)Π}, where u0 (C) is the marginal utility
of the household’s consumption, to be derived below, and E {.} denotes the
expectation at the beginning of the period. Hence the Þrm chooses B, B ∗ , and
a contingent plan for L so maximize E {u0 (C)Π} subject to 2, 3, and 4. The

which are standard. In particular, 5 characterizes the Þrm’s optimal borrowing
policy: issuing an additional unit of peso bonds costs Q dollars at the beginning
of the period, and requires a dollar repayment of 1/S dollars at the end of the
period. At the margin, the expected utility net gain from such issue must be
zero.

2.2

Households

As already mentioned, households provide diﬀerentiated labor services, so each
household enjoys some monopoly power in the labor market. We assume that, at
the beginning of the period, each household sets a wage in pesos, and commits
to satisfy demand forthcoming at that wage at the end of the period. The
household consumes the dollar value of its labor income plus Þrm proÞts.

Market clearing

Since local residents do not consume home goods, the demand for home output
comes from foreigners. We assume that the value of the foreign demand for
home output is exogenous and given by a random variable X. We assume that
E(X) > K and that X is the only source of uncertainty in the model. As a
consequence, the demand function is simply given by
P Y = SX.

(10)

Competitive equilibrium is well deÞned once monetary policy is given. Before
proceeding to the analysis of policy, note that in any competitive equilibrium
household consumption is obtained by combining 3, 4, 7, and 9

The Þrst equality says that consumption equals the dollar value of output minus
the cost of servicing the foreign debt. But 10 implies that, again in equilibrium,
the dollar value of output is given by X, while the debt burden is equal to the
initial cost of investment (K) minus the capital gains or losses on peso debt
associated with an exchange rate surprise (the last term on the RHS). So in
this model the extent of debt dollarization cannot aﬀect the expected value of
consumption. Dollarization can aﬀect the variability of consumption, but this
depends on the distribution of the exchange rate and, hence, on policy.

3

Equilibrium monetary policy

We restrict attention to two policy alternatives: a Þxed exchange rate, deÞned
as a policy that keeps S constant, and a ßexible exchange rate, which keeps
P constant. This section studies the equilibrium outcomes, in particular the
degree of dollarization, under either ßexible rates and Þxed rates. Then we ask
whether either alternative is an equilibrium policy.

3.1

Competitive equilibrium under a ßexible exchange rate

As mentioned earlier, ßexible exchange rates are deÞned as a regime in which
the price of home output is constant. The resulting outcomes will be denoted
by tildes. Clearly the price level is immaterial, so we normalize P̃ = 1.
Equilibrium in the labor market (equation 6) reduces to
W̃ L̃ = (1 − α)Ỹ

(12)

But by 1 output is a function only of L̃, and W̃ is set in advance. It follows
that both Ỹ and L̃ must be constant under ßexible rates. 2 Intuitively, since
monetary policy stabilizes the price of home output and nominal wages are
preset, the real (product) wage is constant. Hence the marginal product of
labor, labor demand, and output must be constant too.
The nominal exchange rate, however, is not constant. By 10,
S̃ =

Ỹ
,
X

(13)

so the distribution of the exchange rate is given by the distribution of exports X.
In particular, the nominal exchange rate appreciates when exports are higher.

Equilibrium portfolios are such that the marginal utility of consumption is orthogonal to the terms of trade. The Þrm accomplished this by choosing B and
B ∗ so as to make consumption constant. From 11 and the fact that under
ßexible exchange rates P̃ = 1, consumption is constant if
B̃ = Ỹ
which is therefore the optimal portfolio allocation. The intuition is straightforward. Given that labor eﬀort is constant and so is the wage, the only risk
the household faces is exchange rate risk, which can cause the price of domestic
output in terms of consumption goods to ßuctuate. The Þrm eliminates this
risk on behalf of its owner, the household, by borrowing an amount in pesos
equal to the (constant) value of output. This way the household is fully hedged
against (real and nominal) exchange rate risk.
The corresponding constant consumption level is, by 11 and 13,
C̃ = E {X} − K.
So, in equilibrium with ßexible rates, the household consumes the expected
dollar value of home output minus the cost ofncapital.
o
Note that under this allocation Q̃B̃ = Ỹ E 1/S̃ = E {X} > K is necessary
for consumption to be positive. This means that initially the Þrm sells peso
bonds with a higher value than its total foreign liability K, and devote some
of the proceeds to buying dollar assets. So the Þrm becomes a net creditor in
dollars and a net debtor in pesos. This ensures that capital gains obtain when
the exchange rate depreciates, which are the exact circumstances in which the
dollar value of national income is low.
To complete the characterization of the equilibrium, observe that nominal
wages are given by the optimal wage setting condition 8, which reduces to3

3.2

Is a ßexible exchange rate an equilibrium policy?

Suppose that for some reason agents expect a policy of ßoating and set wages and
portfolios accordingly. Given those expectations, will the monetary authority
deliver that policy ex-post? In other words, are expectations of ßoating selfvalidating? To answer these questions, here we consider whether ßoating is an
equilibrium policy.
For the interaction between endogenous portfolio selection and monetary and
exchange rate policy, the timing of moves is crucial. We assume the following:
the period under analysis start with a contracting stage in which Þrms issue

and W̃ , 1 , 12 and 14 must be solved simultaneously.

bonds and workers set the value of their nominal wages. Then the central bank
chooses the policy regime, either Þxed or ßexible exchange rates. The authorities
take no other action after that. Finally, uncertainty about exports is realized
and production, trade and consumption take place.
We assume that, in choosing the policy regime, the central bank maximizes
the welfare of its representative citizen. Floating exchange rates are then an
equilibrium policy if the central bank has no incentive to deviate for Þxed exchange rates, given the portfolios and wage contracts were optimally written in
the expectation of ßexible rates. 4
A general analysis of equilibrium policies turns out to be very complex. To
simplify, we impose that, if the central bank is to deviate from ßexible to Þxed
rates, the deviation must leave the expected dollar value of pesos unchanged at
its pre-deviation level. This restriction is not only for tractability, but also to
focus on domestic policy concerns and abstract from the (better known) time
inconsistency issues associated with foreign debt: it ensures that a deviation
implies no expected expropriation of foreign lenders. This may be justiÞed by
the existence of costs of international default.
Denote outcomes under a deviation to Þxed exchange rates
by an overbar.

By assumption, after a policy deviation 1/S̄ must equal E 1/S̃ which, given
13, requires the exchange rate be Þxed at

where the nominal wage rate is that associated with ßexible rates, since it was

In words, the deviation to Þxed exchange rates keeps expected labor supply the
same, but increases the variability of labor eﬀort. The latter obtains because
Þxing the exchange rate means that the price of home output, and hence the
real wage, must ßuctuate in order to accommodate shocks to export demand.
4 This deÞnition of equilibrium policy is the same as in Chari and Kehoe (1990) and Stokey
(1991).

9

Using 11 and the fact that the deviation keeps 1/S̄ at E(1/S̃), consumption
after a deviation to Þxed rates is given by
C̄ = X − K
Taking expectations of this expression we again have that
© ª
E C̄ = E {X} − K = C̃

Hence, the deviation also causes a mean-preserving spread in consumption.
The analysis shows that, by deviating from ßexible rates to Þxed rates when
households had expected the former, the monetary authority induces volatility
into labor supply and consumption without changing the expected value of either
variable. Since volatility decreases expected utility, the policymaker can only
decrease expected utility by switching to Þxed rates. It follows that ßexible
exchange rates are always an equilibrium policy regime.

3.3

Competitive equilibrium under a Þxed exchange rate

Now consider a policy of Þxing the exchange rate at S = S̄ = 1 (we use overbars
to denote Þxed rates). Then nominal demand reduces to
P̄ Ȳ = S̄X = X

(17)

and 6 gives labor eﬀort:
(1 − α)X
,
(18)
W̄
So labor eﬀort becomes proportional to the demand for home output. Employment must ßuctuate since, with Þxed exchange rates, the price of home
output and the product wage must ßuctuate to accommodate changes in demand.
Expression 11 for consumption becomes
L̄ =

C̄ = X − K.

(19)

Home consumption is equal to X minus the constant value of investment. The
reasons is clear from 11: since the exchange rate is Þxed, home agents experience
no unanticipated capital gains nor losses.
For the same reasons B and B ∗ are indeterminate, since bonds in pesos and
dollars are now perfect substitutes. This means that portfolio composition may
be pinned down by other things outside the model.
Finally, nominal wages are given by 8, which reduces to

Is a Þxed exchange rate an equilibrium policy?

To check whether a Þxed rate is an equilibrium policy, consider
to a
n a deviation
o
ßexible exchange rate, assuming that in such a deviation E 1/S̃ = 1/S̄ = 1.
Again, the justiÞcation for the restriction is to ensure that the deviation imposes
no expected expropriation on foreigners.
After a switch, 10 must hold, so that
X
1
=
S̃
P̃ Ỹ
By assumption, the expectation of the LHS after a deviation must equal unity.
But the deviation also implies that both P̃ and Ỹ are constant. Hence, taking
expectation on both sides of the preceding equation, and using 10 again, we Þnd
the exchange rate associated with the deviation,
S̃ =

E {X}
.
X

(21)

Applying this to 6 we have that labor supply is given by
L̃ =

(1 − α)S̃X
(1 − α)E {X}

W̄
W̄

Comparing this last expression with 18 we see that after a deviation to ßoating
labor eﬀort is no longer variable, and its mean value does not change. Hence
there is a “temptation” to abandon Þxed rates.
To Þnd the n
eﬀectoon consumption of a switch to ßexible rates, use 21 in 11
evaluated at E 1/S̃ = 1. This yields

C̃ = X 1 −

+ B̄ − K.

(22)

Hence the eﬀect of the deviation on consumption depends on the degreenof o
dollarization, which is indeterminate under Þxed rates. But notice that E C̃ =
E {X} − K, so the deviation keeps the expected value of consumption constant.
Therefore, expected utility from consumption may increase or fall depending on
the response of the variability of consumption to the deviation.
From 22 we see that after a deviation the variance of consumption must fall
if 0 < B < 2E {X}, and it must increase otherwise. If the variance falls, the
policymaker will unambiguously want to deviate, since that would reduce the
variance of both consumption and labor supply while preserving their expected
values. For instance, if (by ßuke) agents had adopted the portfolio that corresponds to the expectation of ßexible rates, the variance of consumption after
the switch would fall to zero, and deviating from Þxed rates would be optimal
for the policymaker.
It follows that a necessary condition for Þxed rates to an equilibrium policy
is either B < 0 or B > 2E {X}. The Þrst case is perhaps the more interesting
11

one: the representative agent has gross assets in pesos and gross debts in dollars. In equilibrium, this currency mismatch makes no diﬀerence to him nor to
lenders. But it deters the government from abandoning Þxed exchange rates.
Dollarization of liabilities gives rise to fear of ßoating.
Summarizing: if is either B < 0 or B > 2E {X}, the switch to ßexible rates
induces a mean-preserving spread on consumption relative to Þxed exchange
rates. Since the deviation keeps labor eﬀort at its mean value under Þxed rates,
Þxed exchange rates may or may not be an equilibrium. This depends on the
parameters of the model and, in particular, on the utility cost associated with
consumption ßuctuations relative to labor eﬀort ßuctuations (determined by the
shape and curvature of u and v). But also, and importantly for our purposes, it
depends on the currency composition of the Þrm’s debt, which is not uniquely
pinned down in equilibrium.
If a Þxed exchange rate is in fact an equilibrium, then there are multiple
equilibria in policy regimes, since ßexible exchange rates are always an equilibrium. In that case, animal spirits play a role: if agents expect Þxed rates (and
B < 0 or B > 2E {X}) the government will indeed deliver Þxed rates; if agents
expect ßexible rates, the government will choose ßexible rates.

Welfare

Our analysis implies that both ßexible rates and Þxed exchange rates can be
equilibrium policies in our model. Importantly, they can also be Pareto ranked
when they coexist.
We have already shown that expected consumption must be the same under
both policy regimes, and that ßexible exchange rates completely stabilize both
consumption and labor eﬀort. However, it is hard to compare the mean value
of labor eﬀort under the two regimes. Hence the welfare ranking may depend
on functional forms and parameter values.
However, there is no ambiguity if utility functions are CRRA or quadratic:
ßexible rates perform better. To see this formally, assume Þrst that preferences
are of the form

We conclude that for two broadly used classes of preferences, the regime with
ßexible exchange rates yields higher expected welfare. In those cases, if both
ßexible and Þxed rates are equilibrium policy regimes, benevolent policymakers
must endeavor to convince agents that ßoating will indeed be the chosen policy.
One alternative is to commit to a ßexible regime. If this is not possible, direct
regulation of portfolios so as to make ßexible rates optimal ex post could also
be desirable. Recent attempts at “de-dollarizing” Þnancial contracts may be
justiÞed, then, as coordination devices.

Indexed bonds

Readers might wonder whether the results on the multiplicity of equilibrium
policy regimes are an artiÞce of the indeterminacy of portfolios under Þxed
rates. That is not so, as we show in this section by extending the model to a
menu of assets that ensures that portfolios are always fully determined.
We replace peso bonds with bonds that have payoﬀs indexed to the price
of the domestic good. Such bonds are common in emerging markets. More
precisely, we assume that the representative Þrm sells dollar bonds and indexed
bonds. An indexed bond is a promise to P pesos at the end of the period.
Rather than developing the model from scratch, we simply write down the
equilibrium conditions that diﬀer from those of the earlier formulation. Foreign
lenders again arbitrage the returns on both kinds of loans, so the initial price of
an indexed bond, in dollars, must equal the expected terms of trade E {P/S}.

4.1

A ßexible exchange rate once again

Consider Þrst a ßexible rates regime with P̃ = 1. Assuming that this policy is
credible and indeed carried out, indexed bonds become identical to peso bonds.
Hence the outcomes are just the same as with ßexible exchange rates in the
model with peso bonds, characterized in subsection 3.1. Notice in particular
that B̃ = Ỹ , that is, indexed bonds in the portfolio are equal to the value of
home output.
Indexed bonds do make a diﬀerence, however, in analyzing whether ßexible
rates are an equilibrium policy regime. Consider the implications of a deviation
towards Þxed exchange rates. Again to prevent expected expropriation of foreign
lenders, we assume that such a deviation leaves the expected terms of trade,
P/S, unchanged. Using overbars once more to denote the consequences of a
deviation to Þxed rates, this requires

(33)

Hence a switch from ßexible rates to Þxed rates implies a fall in the expected
price of home output. It follows that the expected real wage rises, and expected
labor eﬀort falls. Formally, from 30, 32 and the deÞnition of Ỹ one can derive
L̄ = L̃
Taking expectations we have

Hence, the deviation to Þxed rates implies that labor eﬀort becomes variable
but, in contrast with the case of peso bonds, the mean value of labor eﬀort
falls. The reduction in mean labor eﬀort is welfare-improving, making a switch
towards Þxed rates attractive.5
As in the case of peso bonds, the switch from ßexible to Þxed exchange rates
causes a mean-preserving spread in consumption (the proof is similar to the
one in the case of peso bonds and left to the interested reader.) Additional
consumption variability makes expected welfare fall and reduces the desirability
of the deviation, as in the case of peso bonds. However, with indexed bonds,
5 The fact that an increase in labor supply is welfare-decreasing might seem surprising,
since the model features imperfect competition in the labor market, which causes equilibrium
labor supply to be too low relative to the planner’s solution. But in this model the dollar
value of domestic production is given by 10. Hence working more just causes the terms of
trade to turn against the country, without any beneÞt for consumption.

15

mean labor eﬀort falls. Flexible rates are an equilibrium if the utility beneÞt
associated with the smaller labor eﬀort is less than the cost associated with
increased variability in both consumption and labor.
As a special case, assume that
v(L) = φL1+χ

(35)

where φ > 0 is an arbitrary constant and χ > 0. Assume also that© X isªlognormally distributed. Then, as we show in the appendix, the sign of E v(L̄) −v(L̃)
equals the sign of χ − α. A switch from ßexible rates to Þxed rates increases or
leaves the same the expected cost of eﬀort if χ ≥ α. Since the switch always
causes a mean-preserving spread in consumption, then χ ≥ α is suﬃcient for the
switch to be welfare-decreasing —that is, for ßexible rates to be an equilibrium
policy.
The intuition is that the larger is χ, the larger is the utility cost of the
increased variability of labor eﬀort under a deviation. On the other hand, by
30, a larger α results in smaller ßuctuations in labor eﬀort in a deviation. So
the cost of a switch from a ßexible to a Þxed exchange rate increases with χ and
falls with α.

4.2

A Þxed exchange rate once again

Consider next the policy of Þxing the exchange rate at S̄ = 1. Condition 18 still
gives labor eﬀort, and 28 implies that
¡ © ª
¢
C̄ = X − K + B̄ E P̄ − P̄
(36)

This expression shows that, in contrast with the case of nominal peso bonds,
the currency composition of the debt matters here even with Þxed exchange
rates. The central bank can peg the nominal exchange rate but not the terms of
trade; if peso bonds are indexed, capital gains and losses depend on the latter.
As a consequence, B̄ is not indeterminate. Instead, it must be set to satisfy
the condition 27, which here reduces to
¢
¡
Cov u0 (C̄), P̄ = 0
The price of home output follows from 17 and the production function:

(37)

The rest of the analysis turns out to be more diﬃcult than before, so we
assume from now on that u(C) is quadratic (at least in the relevant range).
Then u0 is linear in C, and the previous expression reduces to
¡
¢
Cov C̄, P̄ = 0
16

That is, equilibrium portfolios must be set so that consumption is orthogonal to
the terms of trade. Using the previous expression for C̄ one readily Þnds that
the stock of indexed bonds in the equilibrium portfolio is
B̄ =

Cov(X, P̄ )
¡ ¢
V ar P̄

This is intuitive: with quadratic utility, B̄ must be chosen to minimize the
variance of consumption which, from 36, is the variance of X − B̄ P̄ . Hence B̄
is the coeﬃcient of a linear regression of X on P̄ .
Given 37 the preceding expression can be written as

Now consider a deviation to ßexible rates, imposing once more the restriction

The inequality follows from Jensen’s inequality. Switching to ßexible rates stabilizes labor eﬀort, but at a level that is higher than the mean value of L under
Þxed rates. The sum of these two eﬀects on the representative household’s
welfare is ambiguous and depends on the parameters of the model.

Recalling 39, one readily notices that E C̄ = E C̃ : the deviation leaves

variance is unclear, although the expressions for C̄ and C̃ reveal that it depends
solely on α and the distribution of X.
C̃ = X − K +

4.3

Multiplicity of policy regimes: a special case

When are a Þxed and a ßexible exchange rate both equilibrium policy regimes?
We can identify precise conditions for this to happen if X is lognormal and
v is of the form 35, which we assume from now on. Then, as the appendix
shows, a switch from Þxed rates to ßexible rates must increase the variance of
consumption. The appendix also shows that the switch increases the expected
cost of eﬀort if α > χ, leaves it the same if α = χ, and reduces it otherwise. As a
consequence, α ≥ χ is suﬃcient (not necessary) for Þxed rates to an equilibrium
policy.
Recall from the discussion at the end of the last subsection that χ ≥ α is
also suﬃcient for ßexible rates to be an equilibrium policy. It follows that both
ßexible rates and Þxed rates are equilibrium outcomes if α and χ are suﬃciently
close to each other. Hence, the fact that peso bonds are indexed does not
eliminate the possibility of multiple equilibria in this model.
If both ßexible rates and Þxed rates are equilibrium outcomes, the appendix
shows that B̄ ∗ is larger than B̃ ∗ in absolute value. That is, under Þxed rates
the Þrm issues more indexed debt and purchases more dollar assets than under
ßexible rates. Why? The intuition is as follows. Flexible exchange rates stabilize
the price of home output, the real wage, and therefore labor eﬀort. The home
portfolio is then structured to eliminate ßuctuations in consumption.
With Þxed exchange rates, by contrast, the price of home output and labor
employment ßuctuate. An adverse shock to exports X, for example, lowers P̃
and L̃ and increases leisure. Portfolios are structured ex ante so that when
leisure rises, consumption rises too. The Þrm accomplishes this by issuing more
indexed debt than under ßexible rates, so that there is a bigger capital gain
when P̃ falls and the real exchange rate depreciates.
18

Finally, the appendix shows that if both Þxed and ßexible exchange rates
are equilibria, ßexible rates again yields higher welfare. In such a case, Þxed
exchange rates may occur as a coordination failure: if agents expect Þxing and
arrange their portfolios accordingly, the monetary authority will validate those
expectations, and social welfare will be ineﬃciently low. As in the case with
peso bonds, enabling the monetary authority to commit to a policy of ßexible
rates would raise social welfare. Alternatively, direct controls on portfolio shares
could also be welfare-improving.

5

Final remarks

We have built a model in which both portfolio composition and monetary policies are determined optimally. A key implication is that, since optimal portfolios
depend on policy and viceversa, there may be more than one equilibrium policy
regime. This suggests that the fear of ßoating that allegedly obtains in many
countries may be an artifact of arbitrary expectations. For certain parameter
values and shock distributions, expectations may be self-validating: if agents
expect Þxing and arrange their portfolios accordingly, the monetary authority
will indeed deliver a Þxed exchange rate. What the literature on fear of ßoating
fails to take into account is that the same would happen if agents expected a
policy of ßexible exchange rates: assets and liabilities would be denominated in
such a way as to make ßoating optimal for the authorities.
Which equilibrium the economy lands on matters. We are able to show that
for plausible functional forms and lognormality of the shock, ßexing delivers
higher expected social welfare than does Þxing. Therefore, policies that anchor
expectations on the ßexible rates outcome —or, alternatively, induce agents to
hold a portfolio that is compatible with ßexing— raise social welfare.
One limitation of the analysis is that here portfolio composition is endogenous, but only given the exogenous restrictions on the menu of assets. While
we have allowed for an asset menu that included more than the usual noncontingent world currency bonds, it may be desirable and useful to derive market incompleteness from more fundamental assumptions on the environment.
That remains a substantial task, however, and at this point we can only leave
it for future research.
A second limitation, of course, is that we have imposed strong restrictions
on the environment and policy options. These restrictions were justiÞed on the
basis of tractability and analytical convenience, but obviously they will have to
be relaxed if the model is to be the basis for more realistic policy evaluation.

where from the second equality on we have assumed that log X is normal with

Change variables and deÞne z = eσ . Note that z depends on σ 2 , the variance

Þnds that the sign of V ar C̃ − V ar C̄ is given by the sign of

z 1+α + z α(1+α) + z + z α − 2z α − 2z 1+α

We have not been able to Þnd the sign of this polynomial analytically, but a
graph of the above expression for α in [0, 1] and z > 1 makes it obvious that the
sign is positive. It follows that a switch from Þx to ßex increases the variance
of consumption.
To Þnd the eﬀect of the switch on the expected cost of eﬀort, note that under
Þxed rates labor eﬀort is given by:
