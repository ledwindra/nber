Accelerating Inflation, Nonassunble Fixed-Rate
Mortgages,

and Consumer

Choice and Welfare

Abstract
This
mortgage

paper measures the

impact of nonassumable, fixed-rate, long-term

financing on household mobility and housing demand during

a periodof accelerating inflation (l965_71l). We calculate that typical
households who bought houses

during

the l96l7l period and utilized this

type of financing would not have moved until the 1975-77 period. And

this is in spite of rising

inccmies

and a sharp fail in the real rental

price or user cost of housing.
We conclude that the nonassumable, fixed-rate mortgage is largely
responsible for bath sluggish housing demand in the l967_7i period and

its surge in the 1976-79 period. Housing activity would have been
far more stable had variable-rate mortgagee been employed. Finally,
the enormous gap between current mortgage rates and those existing in the

19705 and the resultant huge capital gains on existing mortgages does not

bode well for housing activity in the near term future.

and the failure of the real user costs for nonresidential investments to

argued that the U.S. economy has overinvested in housing at the expense of

starts were up by 35 percent; the average quality rose by 7 percent;
and the real price of a constant quality house increased by 21 percent.1
Explanations offered for the sluggishness of housing demand in the
1966-75 decade are based on increases in nominal, as opposed to real

after tax, interest rates. In a world with deposit rate ceilings, an
increase in open market interest rates retards deposit flows, restricting

mortgage purchases of depository institutions. If other lenders do not
make compensatory mortgage investments, then credit to homebuyers is
rationed and, in the absence of other sources of funds, housing demand

is impaired.5 Even if credit funds are ample, lenders may not be willing
to extend them in sufficient amounts to homebuyers. The real user cost
declines because the current greater interest costs (after tax) are more
than outweighed by future (expected) increases in the value of the house

being financed. If lenders are unwilling to make funds available on the
basis of these future expected gains and if households cannot either (i) meet

demand fails to rise not only in response to the decline in the

real user cost but also in response to increases in real income. That Is,
the housing-income ratio falls rather than rises.

with the bond market, see Hend.ershott and Villani (1980)(l98l) and Hendershott
(1980).

The results reported below suggest that the mortgage capital gains

were likely

an

important deterrent to housing demand in the l967_72 period

for households that financed earlier purchases with nonassuxnable, long-

term, fixed-rate mortgages. During this period, such households had to
trade off expected rapid wealth accumulation (owing to a low mortgage
rate in conjunction with rapid anticipated housing capital gains) against
a progressively more "suboptimal" consumption bundle (too little housing

income).

1975, the optimizing choice for most such households was consumption

of too little housing.

The analysis of this paper is divided into three sections. Section I
contains a methodology for calculating the benefits and costs associated
with moving and for determining when particular households who purchased

houses in specific years would have subsequently moved. The calculations
are presented in Section II. For purposes of comparison, similar calculations
are performed based on the assumption that households had utilized variable

rate, rather than fixed rate, financing. A measure of the social costs

The Adjustment Costs
The costs associated with moving this period, rather than next,
include the present (as opposed to later) payment of a realtor's fee,
as well as the low-interest mortgage that the household has to give up.

Assume that the real realtor's fee (F) is equal to a fraction g of the
real value of housing,

F =

g(l-d)

toAi
Xh(ph/Pc)

where d is the rate at which the real housing services from the house depreciate.
By not postponing the sale of the existing house by one period, one
foregoes the real interest saving associated with postponement of the realtor's

fee. The foregone after-tax saving is

CF =

where

[(1_)i_rT]g(l_d)tx(p/p),

loan that is still outstanding.)

The total one-period cost of moving is now equal to

COST = CF ÷ CM,

(17)

Optirnality dictates that the household should postpone the move at Least

until EGM> COST. Because the cost of giving up the mortgage falls
in real terms over time (p0 rises and the mortgage is amortized --

t

increases) and the gain does not, the household should move as soon

as EGM COST.

An

Illustrative Example

In the following section we

classes

report

estimates as to when different

of households (defined by their particular marginal tax brackets

and future growth in real permanent disposable income), who bought houses

in particular years, would have maximized utility by moving. In this
section we provide an example in order to illustrate the precise method

of calculation. We also indicate some assumptions and data sources
underlying the calculations.

5Equation (16) is not symmetric with respect to I

i. When i d 1°

households can refinance (reap a gain) without selling the house. Thus,
we constrain CM to be nonnegative.

12

The income and price elasticities of housing demand are assumed to
be plus and minus 0.75 respectively (# = B =

0.75).

These are consistent

with Polinsky and Elwood (1979), as well as other studies. The constant

income per household was $10,975. (These and all dollar numbers reported
below are 1972 dollars.) The real user cost of owner-occupied housing
for households in the 30% tax bracket in l965: was 5.77% (Hendershott
and Shilling, 1981). This determines A to be 0.2707, and thus

= .2707(y/c)75.

(ii')

The household is assumed to have purchased this house in 1965:11 and

have financed it with a 75% loan-to-value, 25 year, 5.83% mortgage. The
household's real permanent disposable income is posited to have risen

by 1.5 percent per year.6 Given the observed movement in the

and

We

1975:1 below.

In 1971+:14, the household's real income was $12,558, the mortgage

rate was 9.78% and the real user cost had fallen by 2.6 percentage

points to 3.19%. Using equation (11'), x was $23,927, a full $10,000
above x. The total equivalent gain, from (13'), would have been
$2,078 per annum, of which $1,612 was due to the rise in income and
$14.65 to the reduction in real user cost. Without moving, the household

would have to take the consumption bundle of x = $13,866 (the 1965:14

housing) and x = $12,116, $12,558-.0319($13,866). Making use of (6')
and (7'), we can translate this consumption into an equivalent budget
e

e

position of y = $13,068 and c = 6.87%.

From equation (114 ), we then

calculate EGN to be $1,932. Finally, EGM = EG-EGN is $1146.
From equation (16), the real per annum cost of relinquishing the
existing mortgage is $285. and the foregone interest saving on the
realtor's fee is $14. from equation (15). Thus the total one-period

cost from moving is $289. Because this exceeds the one period gain,
this household should have remained in its existing residence.
The combination of a decline in the real after-tax user cost of
capital from 14.27% to 3.25% and in the mortgage rate from 9.78% to

9.27% both increased the gross gain and lowered the cost of moving.
(During the same period the household's disposal income rose slightly

to $12,605.) Repeating the above calculations with these new values,

we obtain

the total equivalent gain between the 1965: 11. and

positions to be $2,1459. The gain without nving is

leaving

1975: 1 budget

equal to $2,1314

a $325 gain from moving. The fall in the nominal mortgage rate

reduced the total one-period cost of moving to $214.5. Thus a net one-

period gain of $79

could

be achieved, and the household should have

moved.

II. The Timing of Moves by Households

The above analysis is employed in this section to determine when
households that purchased houses in the fourth quarters of the years
1959 to 1972 would have moved in order to upgrade (increase) their housing.

As noted above, a move will occur when the gross equivalent gain from
moving, which follows from the choice of a more satisfying consumption
bundle, exceeds the costs of giving up a below-market mortgage and paying

realtors' fees sooner. The optimal period to hold an existing house
depends on a host of variables from the rate of growth

Variable Rate Mortgages
In the following analysis we assume that all housing purchased during
the 1959-72 period was financed with variable rate mortgages (VRM8).

The rate on these mortgages is assumed to equal the observed yield on
new issue fixed-rate mortgages (FRitis). As a result, there would not have
been any capital gains on existing mortgages, and we would expect that

households would have upgraded their housing more frequently in response
to rising incomes and a declining real rental price of housing.
Table 2 presents the same type of data reported in Table 1 except

that the mortgage rates and capital gain (zero) are not listed. Comparing
the two tables, households that purchased in the 1959-61

III. Efficiency Losses from Fixed-Rate Mortgages

By definition, households always maximize

combination

their

utility. Even when

of housing and

nonhousing

goods given their income and the "equilibrium" rental price of housing,

maintaining their mortgage capital gain allows them to achieve the greatest

utility (reach the highest indifference curve in Figure 1). Unfortunately,
maintaining this gain is tantamount to enforcing a capital loss on

mortgage lenders or, equivalently, on other households. The mortgage
capital gain does not provide any net utility or gain to society. On
the other hand, the suboptimal consumption pattern of households with
gains is an efficiency loss that is not matched by a gain elsewhere.
Thus any "reform" that

would reduce mortgage gains and thus suboptimal

consumption patterns would provide a net gain to society. The use of
variable rate mortgages is one such reform. What follows is an attempt
to obtain a rough
against

estimate

of the cost of the regulatory prohibition

variable rate mortgages during the 1966-79 period.

A Methodology for Measuring the Loss

mortgage (EGv) and with a fixed-rate

year.

We

assume further that

1 million

purchased in the fourth quarters of 1966 through

1972. Finally, all households are assumed to correspond to our standard

one (r =

0.3,

v =

0.75 and income grows at 1.5 percent per year).

Thus, there are only 12 household classes (j =

12).

Calculation of the losses from fixed and variable rate mortgages is

illustrated in Figure 3 which is based on Figure 2. The latter indicates
the consumption patterns between 1966 and 1979 of a household buying in
1965:1+ under three different assumptions: (a) no transactions costs
(neither a brokerage fee nor mortgage capital gain), (b) no mortgage
capital gain (a brokerage fee, but use of a variable-rate mortgage),

and (c) use of fixed-rate mortgage (both brokerage fee and mortgage capital

gain). The jagged line is the optimal consumption pattern and reflects
every twist and turn in the real user cost or rental price of housing.

The household effectively moves every quarter. The solid line, which
jumps discreetly in 1968 and 1975 to reflect moves at those times, is

based upon variable-rate financing. The hatched line is based upon fixedrate financing and indicates only one move, in

1975.

The move in 1968

with the VRM shifts the household to the optimal consumption line at
that point and generally keeps the household closer to this line throughout

the 1968-71+ period. Thus the loss with a VRM is generally less than with
8A more precise calculation would compound the gains prior to 1972 and discount
those after 1972. Given the low real after-tax interest rates existing in the
1970s and the compounding of gains prior to 1972, introduction of this precision

Some Estimates
Table 3 contains estimates of the loss per household [column (2)]
initially purchasing in different years [column (1)] and the total loss
for each class household [column (14)], which is the product of columns
(3) and (14).

The cummulative loss for the 1966-79 period is 18.52

billion 1972 dollars. Over 18 billion of this accrues during the period
1967-77. That is, for this 11 year period the loss is 1 2/3 billion dollars
per year.

This

analysis overstates the direct welfare loss due to FRMs for a

number of reasons. First, fewer household moves generate a resource

saving. This includes both direct moving

expenses

and the substantial

search costs reflected in realtor fees. Second, probably a fifth of the
value of house sales in the 1961-65 period was financed by assumable,

FHA-VA mortgages.9 Third, many households move for reasons other than
normal income growth and changes in relative prices. For example, one
might move to achieve extraordinary income growth or to be closer to
(further from) ones family. %Then such moves occur, the optimal consumption
bundle will be selected, in general reducing the measured loss from FRMs.
On the other hand, there are some unmeasured indirect costs of FRMs.
Because of capital gains on mortgages, some households will forego or
postpone moves that would increase the aggregate welfare of society;

labor mobility and productivity are reduced. On net, our measure of the
cost of FRMs could overstate the true value by as much as a multiple of
two.

General

Equilibrium Considerations

The above is a partial equilibrium analysis of welfare loss insofar

as only one distortion of increased inflation on
considered.

Another well-known distortion is the favored tax treatment of

9Between 1961 and 1965, 23 percent of loan originations on 1- to 1i-fami1y
houses were FHA-.VA financed (Mortgage Loan Gross Flows, U.S. Department
of HIJD, 1968, Table 25). Because loan-to-value ratios are higher for
FHA-VA than conventionally financed houses, the share of housing that
was FHA-VA financed is lower than 23 percent.

27

owner-occupied

housing vis-a-vis business capital; in fact, this treatment

is the source of the decline in the real rental price of owner-occupied

housing noted above. Thus, the distortionr in consumption in the 1967-76
period owing to capital gains on fixed-rate mortgages is partially an
offset to the distortion generated by fundamental biases in tax law.1°
The efficiency loss due to FRMs has also been calculated for the

case where the real user cost of housing was frozen at the value existing

when the original house purchase occurred. That is, suboptimal consumption
(too little housing) exists in this calculation only because households

do not allocate any of their increased real income to housing. Our
estimate of the efficiency loss in this case is only 2

billion

for the

1967-77 period. Thus seven-eights of the earlier calculated distortion
due to FRMS actually generated positive welfare because it acted as an
offset to another distortion in the system.
In an earlier paper, we calculated the annual economy wide efficiency
loss owing to the favorable tax treatment of owner-occupied housing to be
1

3/14 billion (1972

[Hendershott and

Hu

dollars) in 19614-65 and 6

billion

in 1976-77

(1980)]. Thus the increase between the

middle 1960s

and 1970s was just over 14 billion. If one assumes that the loss increased
linearly between these dates, then the annual incremental (above the
19613_65 value of 1 3/11. billion) loss from overinvestment in housing in

10The authorization of variable rate mortgages by the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board in 1979 and the obviously desperate need of most mortgage lenders
to achieve a better balance between the effective maturities of their
assets and liabilities suggests that very few nonassumable, long-term
fixed-rate mortgages will be originated in the United States in the 1980s.
As a result, if inflation should accelerate in the late 1980s or 1990s,
mortgage capital gains will not exist to offset the inducement to greater
housing investment.

28

the decade from the middle 1960s to the middle 1970s was just over

$2 billion. This is not much greater than our
of

$1

2/3 billion estimate

the loss due to underinvestment in housing owing to nonassumable long-term,

fixed-rate mortgages. In addition, the two alternative mechanisms proposed
for the sluggishness of housing activity in this decade --

the

sharp increase

in the ratio of mortgage payments to income and credit rationing (see the
introduction to this paper) --

could also have been operating. It seems

safe to conclude that the net efficiency loss during the 1966-75

triggered

period

by the acceleration in inflation and the favored tax treatment

of owner-occupied housing was relatively minor.
Unfortunately, the 1976-79 housing boom certainly changed matters.
Annual single-family starts averaged 1.141. million, xp from 1.15 million

in the previous four years and roughly 1.0 million in the two four year

periods prior to that. Moreover, the average quality of these starts
jumped by nearly 10 percent relative to previous years (see footnote
7), and the real price of a constant quality house increased by 21 percent

between the third

quarters of 1975

and 1979.11 By 1979, the efficiency

loss from overinvestment in owner-occupied housing was likely substantial)

11The real price is defined as the ratio of the price of the constant (197L)
quality house to the CPI net of the shelter component. With the latter
indexed to unity in 1967 (when the constant quality price equalled $2L.8
thousand), the real price rose from $26.8 thousand in 1975:3 to $32.5
thousand in 1979:3. (By 1980:4, the real price had declined by 3 percent.)
overinvestment seems certain to be reduced over time owing to the
economic policies of the Reagan administration (high real interest rates
and reduced taxation of returns on assets other than owner-occupied housing).

29

V. Conclusion

This paper attempts to explain the surprising absence of a surge in
housing demand in the 1967_714 period. The absence is a. surprise because

the real user costs or rental prices for owner-occupied housing appear
to have fallen sharply in this period (by 2 to 3 percentage points --

or

25 to 50 percent -- between l961+.65 and 1973_711., depending on the households

marginal tax bracket). Our explanation of the absence of a housing boom
follows from the fact that most housebuyers in the 1950s and 1960s
financed their purchases with nonassumable, long-tern, fixed-rate mortgages.

The sharp increase in the nominal mortgage rate from under 6 to well over 9
percent during this period created substantial mortgage capital gains for
these buyers; however, given the nonassuinability of their mortgages, the

gains could only be reaped if the households maintained their existing
houses (continued low rate financing while their houses inflated rapidly

in value). To the extent that households chose to reap these gains,
housing demand failed to rise in response to both 'the decline in the

real rental price and increases in real income. For these households,
the housing-income ratio actually fell.
The paper contains 'three sections. The first provides a methodology

for calculating the benefits and costs associated with moving and for determining
when households who purchased houses in secific years would have

moved. During the 1967-78 period, households are viewed as weighing the
benefits of retaining existing low-rate mortgages (and of postponing the
payment of realtors fees) against the costs of a progressively more
ttsuboptimal" consumption bundle (too little housing given its falling
