ABSTRACT

Traditionally, the effects of monetary policy actions on output are thought to be transmitted via
monetary or credit channels. Real business cycle theory, by contrast, highlights the role of real price
changes as a source of revisions in spending and production decisions. Motivated by the desire to focus
on the effects of price changes in the monetary transmission mechanism, this paper incorporates a direct
measure of the real own-price of money into an estimated vector autoregression and a calibrated real
business cycle model. Consistent with this new view of the monetary transmission mechanism, both
approaches reveal that movements in the own-price of money are strongly related to movements in
output.

The Own-Price of Money and a New Channel of Monetary Transmission
Traditionally, the effects of monetary policy actions on output are thought to be
transmitted via monetary or credit channels. In the former, changes in the nominal
quantity of money affect spending directly whereas, in the latter case, open market
operations induce changes in interest rates that affect spending; in some models, credit
rationing can have a secondary effect on output as well. Real business cycle models, in
contrast, emphasize that changes in real prices can be a consequence of monetary policy
actions and that economics most naturally focuses on price changes as the source of
revisions in spending and production decisions. Unfortunately, estimation or calibration of
real business cycle models to illustrate this theoretical proposition has been handicapped
by the apparent absence of a continuous time series of price data that would reflect
changes in the stance of monetary policy. Thus, the perceived lack of any price data
flowing directly from actions taken by the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee
(FOMC) has led authors to examine proxies and isolated incidents rather than directlyobservable price changes over a broad span of time. For example, Romer and Romer (1989)
extracted anecdotal evidence from transcripts of FOMC meetings to identify six episodes of
negative monetary policy shocks associated with attempts to reduce inflation; the dummy
variable that marks these decisions explains a substantial portion of the variation in
output. In a similar vein, Plosser (1991) treated increases in reserve requirements between
1937-39 as an increase in the cost of deposit creation and examined that period for
fluctuations in output associated with this change in the setting of one monetary policy
lever.

1

Motivated by the desire to focus on the effects of price changes on output as a
consequence of monetary policy actions, this paper introduces a new model of monetary
transmission. In it neither the nominal quantity of money nor interest rates is linked
directly to output but, instead, changes in the real own-price of money are associated with
aggregate fluctuations. To this end, we first discuss how the own-price of money can be

2

measured in a manner consistent with results in modern aggregation theory and, in so
doing, produce a continuous time series of real prices that can be used in empirical work.
The characteristics of the resulting data then are examined, in overview, within a VAR
framework that allows changes in a nominal measure of monetary policy (the adjusted
monetary base) and changes in the real price of money to affect output separately. We then
discuss a real business cycle model with the nominal quantity of money and modify it to
incorporate the real price of money as well. Once specified, this model is calibrated and
time paths for data generated by it are compared against actual output data. We find that
the synthetic and actual data evolve along similar paths and that a direct measure of the
real own-price of money appears to offer a new channel of monetary policy transmission
apart from either the monetary or credit views.
Measuring the Own-Price of Money
Empirical work in monetary economics typically uses measures of the aggregate
quantity of money produced by central banks. These data are called simple sum aggregates
because they are unweighted, arithmetic summations of the deposits in the various
categories subsumed within the aggregate. The theoretical implications of simple sum
aggregation are that each asset in the index is a perfect substitute for every other asset in
the group and, as such, the representative consumer has a utility function of the Leontief
form.

2

Alternatively, an aggregate quantity of money also can be constructed as an index

of the superlative class and, in this case, quantities of index components are weighted by
shares of expenditures on their monetary service flows. Here, the form of the sub-utility
function for money holdings is unknown but the index number will track its value over time
as changes in the relative prices of alternative forms of money induce substitutions that
alter the expenditure share weights of the components and the quantities held of those
deposit categories in the aggregate.
No matter what type of index is chosen to measure the aggregate quantity of money,
principles of duality require that each, as a matter of internal consistency, is paired with a

3

precise expression for the corresponding own-price of money. Thus, the perfect
substitutability implication of the Leontief technology behind simple sum aggregation
requires that the own price of the monetary aggregate be the lowest price, at time t, among
the assets within the aggregate.

3

The paragraphs below will show that this own-price will

take the form of a minimum user cost.

4

In contrast, the own price of aggregate money,

when measured by a superlative index, will be the share-weighted sum of each asset’s user
cost.

5

In neither case, however, is the own-price of money merely an interest rate chosen

to represent the opportunity cost of foregone interest on a single alternative to money
holdings.
To illustrate these points, the construction of a superlative index number begins by
calculating total expenditures on the components of the aggregate. That expenditure (Et)
can be written as Et =

åx

it

pit . When aggregation is over monetary assets, xit is the

nominal quantity of monetary asset i at t and pit is its real price; equivalently, one can
construct the expenditure magnitude by using real quantities and nominal prices. Because
monetary assets are durables that do not perish during the period from use, their prices are
their user costs. The formula for the real user cost of a monetary asset, derived by Barnett
(1978), can be written as:

pit = ( Rit − rit ) /(1 + Rt )
where Rit is a benchmark rate of return, rit is the own rate of return on the ith component at
time t.

6

With the user cost and quantity data, the expenditure share on asset j is sjt =
xjtpjt/Et. A Divisia quantity index in continuous time (and its Tornqvist discrete time
approximation) computes the growth rate of the aggregate as the share-weighted average of
its components and satisfies
dlog Xt =

å 0.5 * (s

it

7

+ sit − 1)d log xit

while the Divisia price index Pt in continuous time satisfies

4

dlog Pt =

å 0.5 * ( s

it

+ sit − 1)d log pit .

Behavior of the Simple Sum and Divisia Price Duals
Figure 1 illustrates the behavior of percentage changes in the real price of money as
measured by nominal price duals deflated by the geometric mean of the GDP deflator and
the CPI. With a variety of aggregates that might be examined, we have chosen to examine
data for simple sum and Divisia measures of an aggregate consisting of M1 assets plus
savings deposits. Although this aggregate is not reported by the Federal Reserve, it has
been examined by Rotemberg, et al. (1995) and named “M1-plus” by Belongia (1996). More
important for issues regarding aggregation, however, this grouping possesses the property
of weak separability such that it is a candidate for aggregation; by contrast, M2 fails this
test.

8

Thus, studies that have created a Divisia measure of M2 still have been in error

because they have applied a legitimate index number formulation to a group of commodities
that fails the first test (weak separability) in the construction of an aggregate data series.
The simple sum price dual for this asset collection is a mixture of the user costs of other
checkable deposits and savings deposits issued by thrifts. An exception to this general
result occurred during the period of 1983-1986 when money market deposit accounts
(MMDAs) were reported separately rather than as part of savings deposits; during this
interval, the user cost of MMDAs represented the lowest user cost in the simple sum
aggregates.
Despite the fundamental differences in the manner each series is constructed,
figure 1 shows that the two follow the same broad patterns; this picture is reinforced by a
comparison of values for the means and standard deviations of the series. And, while both
series demonstrate considerable variability, Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests show that each
is stationary. Finally, from an economic standpoint, it is interesting to note that sharp
increases in the price of money tend to be associated with the on-set of recessions, whereas
sharp declines appear to lead economic expansions. A potential explanation for this pattern

5

in the data and more detailed exploration of its economic consequences is the focus of the
real business model derived and discussed later.
A Small VAR Model
How the monetary price dual might be associated with aggregate activity can be
examined by comparing its contribution to the variance decomposition of output
fluctuations relative to that of the nominal quantity of money. Within such an approach, it
also is possible to compare both the quantitative and qualitative implications derived from
otherwise identical models that use simple sum or superlative index numbers. For these
purposes, a VAR model was estimated with the growth rates of real, per capita GDP (y), the
adjusted monetary base (AMB) and the real price of money (pdual) as the system’s
endogenous variables. The model was estimated with quarterly data over a sample
spanning 1960:2– 2001:4. Two lags were used for each variable and experimentation with
longer lags did not affect the results in a meaningful way.
The impulse-response functions shown in the top panel of figure 2 indicate that
innovations to the monetary base contribute little to fluctuations in output whereas
innovations to the Divisia M1-plus price dual are related negatively to output growth. The
variance decomposition statistics reveal that about five percent of the variance of output
growth can be attributed to the price dual whereas less than 0.5 percent is associated with
the monetary base. The same VAR, when estimated with the real simple sum price dual,
yields similar results with innovations to the own-price of money showing a larger impact
on output growth than that associated with innovations to base growth. Indeed, with plots
of the two price measures in figure 1 showing similar behavior over time, this result is not
surprising.
Modification of the VAR, however, highlights how measurement issues can affect the
quality of empirical work. To illustrate the point, the VAR with the simple sum price dual is
augmented by the addition of a term reflecting the difference between the growth rate of the
Divisia and simple sum price duals as a separate term. The effect of this change is shown

6

in the bottom panel of figure 2. In this case, the difference between the two price measures
has a larger effect on output growth than innovations to the monetary base and this effect
is nearly as large as that associated with innovations to the simple sum price dual itself.
Thus, while an investigation based on simple sum monetary aggregates would be internally
consistent if it measured the own-price of money as the minimum real user cost among the
component assets, it would be throwing away information contained in superlative index
numbers.
Over all, these figures lend credence to a RBC story that would attribute output
fluctuations associated with monetary policy to a change in prices rather than the nominal
quantity of money. Any observed empirical associations among these series, however,
occur in the absence of a theoretical model that would rationalize them. The next section
discusses a model in which the real price of money, as well as its nominal quantity, have
the potential to affect output.
The Model: Overview
The model borrows elements from real business cycle models with money developed
in King and Plosser (1984) and Coleman (1996) as well as from the shopping time model of
McCallum and Goodfriend (1987). The economy consists of a representative household, a
representative firm, a representative bank, and a monetary authority. The activities of each
of these agents are now described in turn.
The Representative Household
The representative household enters each period t = 0,1,2,… with Mt-1 units of
currency, Bt-1 bonds, and Kt units of capital. At the beginning of the period, the household
receives Tt additional units of currency in the form of a lump-sum transfer from the
monetary authority. Next, the household’s bonds mature, providing Bt-1 more units of
currency. The household uses some of this currency to purchase Bt new bonds at the price
of 1/rt dollars per bond, where rt denotes the gross nominal interest rate between t and t+1.

7

After this initial bond-trading session, the household is left with Mt-1+Tt+Bt-1-Bt/rt
units of currency. It divides this currency up into an amount Nt to be used to purchase
goods and an amount Mt-1+Tt+Bt-1-Bt/rt-Nt to be deposited in the bank. The household also
borrows Lt dollars from the bank, bringing the total nominal value of its deposits to
(1)

Dt = Mt − 1 + Tt + Bt − 1 − Bt / rt − Nt + Lt .
During period t, the household supplies ht units of labor and Kt units of capital to

the representative firm, receiving credit for Wtht+QtKt in return, where Wt denotes the
nominal wage rate and Qt denotes the nominal rental rate for capital. The household
purchases output from the representative firm at the nominal price Pt; it divides its
purchases into an amount Ct to be consumed and an amount It to be invested. Making
these transactions requires

æ Ct + It ö
(2) st = γ N ç
÷
è Nt / Pt ø

χN

æ Ct + It ö
+γ Dç
÷
è Dt / Pt ø

χD

units of shopping time, where γN > 0, χN > 1, γD > 0, and χD > 1. By investing It units of
output during period t, the household increases its capital stock during period t+1
according to
(3)

K t +1 = (1 − δ ) K t + I t ,

where 1 > δ > 0.
At the end of period t, the household owes the bank rLtLt dollars, where rLt is the
gross nominal interest rate on loans. At the same time, however, the bank owes the
household rDtDt dollars, where rDt is the gross nominal interest rate on deposits. After all of
these transactions are settled, the household carries Mt units of currency into period t+1,
where
(4)

M t = N t + Wt ht + Qt K t + rDt Dt − Pt (Ct + I t ) − rLt Lt .

The household, therefore, seeks to maximize the expected utility function

8

∞

(5) E å β t [ln(Ct ) −η(ht + st )],
t =0

with 1 > β > 0 and η > 0, subject to the constraints (1)-(4), each of which must hold for all t
= 0,1,2,….
The Representative Firm
The representative firm hires ht units of labor at the nominal wage Wt and Kt units of
capital at the nominal rental rate Qt in order to produce Yt units of output according to the
constant-returns-to-scale technology described by
(6)

Yt = K t α ( Z t ht ) 1−α ,

with 1 > α > 0. In (6), the productivity shock Zt follows a random walk with positive drift:

(7) ln( Z t ) = ln( z ) + ln( Z t −1 ) + ε zt ,
where z > 1 and the zero-mean, serially uncorrelated innovation εzt is normally distributed
with standard deviation σz. The firm acts to maximize its profits, equating the marginal
product of labor to the real wage Wt/Pt and the marginal product of capital to the real rental
rate Qt/Pt.
The Representative Bank
During period t, the representative bank makes loans worth Lt dollars and accepts
deposits worth Dt dollars. It receives interest on its loans at the gross rate rLt and pays
interest on its deposits at the gross rate rDt. Let θ , 1 > θ > 0, denote the required reserve
ratio. Assuming that rLt > 1, the bank will never find it optimal to hold excess reserves;
hence

(8) Lt = (1 − θ ) Dt
will hold for all t = 0,1,2,….

9

During period t, the bank creates deposits with total real value Dt/Pt using a
technology that requires xt(Dt/Pt) units of output, where the financial-sector cost shock xt
follows the first-order autoregression
(9)

ln( x t ) = (1 − ρx ) ln( x ) + ρx ln( x t −1 ) + ε xt .

In (9), 1 > ρx > 0, x > 0, and the zero-mean, serially uncorrelated innovation εxt is normally
distributed with standard deviation σx. Hence, the bank’s nominal profits during period t
are

(10) Π t = (rLt − 1) Lt − (rDt − 1) Dt − Pt x t ( Dt / Pt ).
Since competition in the banking industry drives these profits to zero, (8) and (10) imply
that

(11) rDt = 1 + (1 − θ )(rLt − 1) − x t
must hold for all t = 0,1,2,…, indicating that the financial-sector cost shock xt impacts
directly on the deposit rate rDt in equilibrium.
The Monetary Authority
In equilibrium, Mt = Mt-1 + Tt and Bt = Bt-1 = 0 for all t = 0,1,2,…. Substituting these
conditions, together with (8), into (1) confirms that in this economy, the monetary base Mt
equals currency Nt plus reserves θDt. Let µt = Mt/Mt-1 denote the gross rate of money base
growth and assume, for simplicity, that the monetary authority conducts policy so that µt
follows the first-order autoregression

(12) ln( µt ) = (1 − ρµ ) ln( µ ) + ρµ ln( µt −1 ) + ε µt ,
where 1 > ρµ > 0, µ > 1, and the zero-mean, serially uncorrelated innovation εµt is normally
distributed with standard deviation σµ.
Solution, Calibration, and Results

Equations (1)-(12), when combined with the first-order conditions describing the
optimizing behavior of the representative household and firm, form a large system of
nonlinear stochastic difference equations. After these equations are log-linearized around
the system’s unique steady state, they can be solved using standard methods, such as
those described by Blanchard and Kahn (1980). The theory’s implications then can be
explored numerically once the model is fully calibrated—that is, once specific values are
assigned to each of the model’s parameters.
Calibration
Since the model is built around a standard, real business cycle framework, many of
its parameters can be assigned values used throughout the literature on real business
cycles. For example, the depreciation rate δ is set equal to 0.025; with each model period
interpreted as a quarter year in real time, this choice corresponds to an annual depreciation
rate for physical capital of 10 percent. Similarly, the setting β = 0.99 implies that the
representative household’s annual discount factor is 4 percent. The setting η = 2.7 implies
that the household spends about one-third of its time—or eight hours out of twenty-four—
working. Finally, the setting α = 0.33 dictates that capital receives a one-third share of
national income; labor receives the remaining two-thirds.
Values for other parameters can be assigned so that the model matches key
statistics that are computed from the postwar US data. For example, the setting z =
1.00464 implies that the annualized steady-state growth rate of output in the model is 1.87
percent, equal to the average annual growth rate of real, per-capita GDP in the US from
1959 through 2001. The setting σz = 0.0088 for the standard deviation of the innovation to
the productivity shock makes the standard deviation of output growth in the model equal to
the standard deviation of real, per-capita GDP growth in the US data.
The parameter θ, which measures the required reserve ratio in the model, is set
equal to 0.0475, based on the observation that from 1959 through 2001, the average ratio
of required reserves to the deposits included in the M1-plus measure of money is also about

11

4.75 percent. Similarly, setting x = 0.011 for the average marginal cost of creating deposits
allows the steady-state user cost of deposits in the model to match the postwar average of
user costs of the deposits included in the M1-plus monetary aggregate. With γN = 0.00004
and γD = 0.008, the steady-state currency-output and deposit-output ratios from the model
coincide with the average currency-output and deposit-output ratios in the US data. The
setting σx = 0.145 for the standard deviation of the financial-sector cost shock allows the
model to replicate the standard deviation of the growth rate of the Divisia M1-plus price
dual as measured in the US data. Finally, the parameters of the money supply rule (12) are
set to match the results from a regression of the quarterly growth rate of the US adjusted
monetary base, 1959:1 through 2001:4, on a constant and its own lagged value: µ = 1.0167,

ρµ = 0.46, and σµ = 0.007.
In the absence of any obvious way of linking the model’s three remaining parameters
to statistics constructed from the US data, values for these parameters are chosen that
seem reasonable or, at least, do not seem unreasonable. The settings χN = 2 and χD = 2
imply that the shopping-time functions for currency and deposits introduced in (2) are both
quadratic. The setting ρx = 0.75, meanwhile, implies that the financial-sector cost shock is
more persistent than the shock to the growth rate of the monetary base, but less persistent
than the shock to productivity.
Results
Figures 3 - 5 display, respectively, the impulse responses of four of the model’s
variables -- output growth, monetary base growth, Divisia M1-plus growth, and the growth
rate of the Divisia M1-plus price dual -- to each of the model’s three shocks: To
productivity, to the cost of creating deposits, and to the growth rate of the monetary base.
In this flexible-price monetary model, as in the basic real business cycle model,
productivity shocks represent the dominant source of output fluctuations. A positive
technology shock (zt ) permanently increases the level of output; hence, in figure 3, it

12

temporarily increases the growth rate of output. Under the simple monetary policy rule
described by (9), the monetary base is an exogenous variable; hence, it does not respond at
all to the productivity shock. Nevertheless, the positive technology shock and the resulting
increase in output lead to an endogenous rise in the deposit-currency ratio, causing the
growth rate of Divisia M1-plus to increase endogenously as well. Therefore, a positive
correlation between the growth rates of output and the Divisia monetary aggregates
emerges from this model, even in the case where productivity shocks are the sole force
driving business cycle dynamics. The nominal interest rate movements set off by the
productivity shock lead to an increase in the user costs of both currency and deposits, also
leading to a rise in the Divisia M1-plus price dual.
The financial-sector cost shock (xt ) represents the model’s closest analog to the
innovation in the growth rate of Divisia M1-plus price dual identified earlier in the US data.
Just as in the data, this shock generates a decline in output growth. Remarkably, the 0.18
percentage-point decline in output growth for the model, shown in figure 4, coincides
almost exactly with the decline in output growth in the data, shown in figure 2.
In this flexible-price model, which includes none of the traditional Keynesian or
monetarist sources of monetary nonneutrality, shocks to the rate of monetary base growth

µt affect real variables through inflation-tax effects alone. Hence, in figure 5, the shock to
monetary base leads to a small decline in output growth. Growth in Divisia M1-plus
increases, reflecting the increase in currency, reserves, and deposits facilitated by the
policy-induced increase in the monetary base. Once again, interest rate movements
following the policy shock cause the Divisia M1-plus price dual to rise.
Overall, these impulse responses give rise to the impression that, while the model
produces little or no correlation between the exogenous growth rate of the monetary base
and the growth rate of output, it does show a positive correlation between the endogenous
growth rate of the Divisia M1 monetary aggregate and the growth rate of output. In the
model, in fact, the correlation between monetary base growth and output growth is -0.0116;

13

the correlation between Divisia M1-plus growth and output growth is 0.2175. Moreover,
the impulse responses from the model and the data suggest that large changes in the real
value of the Divisia M1-plus price dual play a key role in generating this endogenous
money-output relationship.
Conclusions
While most macroeconomic models incorporate a link between changes in the
nominal quantity of money and aggregate fluctuations, real business cycle models
emphasize the role of price changes on spending and production decisions. Empirical
evaluation of this role has been difficult, however, because it has not been clear how the
effects of monetary policy actions could be summarized in a single price variable, especially
if the rate of interest is viewed as the price of credit rather than the price of money. This
paper offers a solution to the measurement problem by introduction of the economic price
dual to the monetary quantity aggregate. Evaluation of this measure’s impact on output
growth indicates that it exerts a stronger influence than that of the monetary base and, in
particular, that increases in the own-price of money are associated with declines in output.
Moreover, the results indicate that the Divisia price dual contains more information than
that of the simple sum measure.

1

Although some might regard the policy stance index of Boschen and Mills (1995) as being

representative of this concept, it is arbitrary in its construction and does not focus directly
on a single real concept, such as reserve requirements. Also see Kydland and Prescott
(1990) for another study motivated by the idea that variables other than the nominal
quantity of money are primarily responsible for fluctuations in real activity.
2

Moreover, such an index does not internalize pure substitution effects such that the

index value may change even though the value of the monetary service flow from a stock of
money holdings is unchanged.
3

This result offers a well-defined and unique answer to the long-standing debate about

the relative merits of short- v. long-term interest rates as a measure of the own price of
money in money demand functions: It is neither because aggregation theory requires that
the own-price measure must be the price dual to the quantity aggregate. Long- or shortterm interest rates more generally are regarded correctly in this function as prices of
substitute or complementary assets that can shift the demand for money, rather than a
price variable that represents movements along the demand curve's length. This implies
that most empirical demand for money functions have been mis-specified in the sense of
omitting a proper measure of money’s own price and not being able to identify a movement
along the curve’s length from a shift in the demand curve’s position.
4

While it is true that the asset with lowest user cost also will be that earning the highest

rate of return, the nonlinear transformation in the user cost formula does not permit simply
using maximum rates of return.
5

Goldfeld (1987, p. 135) intuited as much when he pointed out that:

“Measuring this implicit rate of return is no easy matter. Matters are considerably
more complicated when broader definitions of money are used and some components of
money bear explicit interest, especially when there are several components each carrying a
different rate of return. The aggregate own rate of return would then be a complex function
of interest rates, shares, and elasticities of each of the components.”

22

6

In principle, the benchmark rate of return would be the return on a completely illiquid

asset with the example being the return on human capital in a world without slavery. As a
matter of practice, the benchmark rate has been the maximum own-rate among the assets
in the aggregate at time t. An explanation for this choice is offered in Barnett, et al. (1992).

Notice that the Divisia index formula is not self-dual because (Xt,Pt) are not a dual pair;

this result was reported by Theil (1967) and occurs because the weights in a Divisia index
are average expenditure shares across two periods. This result is analogous to the fact that
if one uses the Laspeyres index for a quantity index, then one should not use the Laspeyres
price index with it, but rather the Paasche price index, which is the dual to the Laspeyres.
So (Laspeyres, Paasche) are dual pairs, but (Laspeyres, Laspeyres) and (Paasche,Paasche)
are not dual pairs for (quantity, price). So neither Laspeyres nor Paasche indexes are selfdual. But in the case of the Tornqvist approximation to Divisia, P*t is very close to Pt and Xt
is very close to X*t. With the errors between the two formulae for quantity (or the two
quantities for price) of a third order magnitude in the changes, studies still use a Divisia
index both for quantity and for price and ignore the tiny violation of Fisher’s factor reversal
test. The Fisher ideal index is self dual, but the Fisher ideal along with all other index
numbers in Diewert’s superlative class are equal to each other to within the roundoff error
of the component data, and the Tornqvist approximation has its own advantages.

This asset collection has been shown by Belongia (2001) and Swofford and Whitney

(1987) to be a weakly-separable asset group that meets a sufficient condition for
aggregation. More generally, however, aggregating over an admissible asset grouping (i.e., a
collection of monetary assets that is weakly separable from other assets and goods) is
critical to any evaluation of index numbers. For example, the continued use of simple sum
M2 has been defended because it appears to have a stable demand function. The M2 asset
collection, however, is not weakly separable and, as such, fails to satisfy a basic condition
for any economic aggregate; specifically, the results in Belongia (2001) for the U.S.,

23

Germany and Japan, indicate that the inclusion of time deposits in a monetary aggregate is
responsible for the violation of separability conditions. Moreover, as Barnett and Zhou
(1994) have discussed, the inherent instability of simple sum aggregates has led to a
continual broadening in their coverage to induce, for some unknown length of time, the
artificial and illusory stability that can be associated with aggregating over wider ranges of
objects. That is to say, they predict that simple sum M3 eventually will be become the
choice for empirical studies once simple sum M2 begins to show instability.
