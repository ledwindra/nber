    "abstract": "\n\nThe strong monetary policy actions undertaken by advanced economies' central banks have led to complaints of \u201ccurrency wars\u201d by some emerging market economies, and to widespread demands for more macroeconomic policy coordination. This paper revisits these issues. It concludes that, while advanced economies' monetary policies indeed have had substantial spillover effects on emerging market economies, there was and still is little room for coordination. It then argues that restrictions on capital flows were and are a more natural instrument for advancing the objectives of both macro and financial stability.\n\n",
