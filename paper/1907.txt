Wage Changes in Job Changes

ABSTRACT

This is a study of short and longer-run wage gains observed

in moving from one job (firm) to the next. Short-run wage cams
are defined as wacie chanc,es over the survey year bracketing the move

minus the onportunity cost of moving. The atteris measured by waqe
arowth of a subcirouo of stayers whose mobility behavior and other

charactristjcs are the same as of the current period movers.
Loncier-run wage gains are defined as the difference in wages between
two successive jobs at the same tenure levels, net of experience,

again net of opnortunity costs.
Wace gains of movers are generally positive, except for layoffs

of older workers. A large part of the gain is due to the lesser
wacie growth on the job of movers compared to (all) stayers. This
is consistent with below average amounts of on the job training
observed for movers compared to all workers.
Wage gains of quits exceed those of layoffs, despite similar

wage levels and wage growth on the preceding job. Wage gains of
older movers are smaller compared to gains of younger movers, both
in quits and in layoffs. Differences in search conditions and in
the nature of seoaratjons helo to explain these findings.

WAGE CHANGES IN JOB CHANGES

I. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY

In

this study we estimate short and longer—run wage changes observed in

the. period of moving from one job to the next. Short—run wage

changes

are

defined as the difference between the starting wage on the new job and the

wage observed a year before on the old job. Longer—run changes are defined as
the difference in wages between the two jobs at the same tenure levels, net of

experience. In effect, this change in wages is measured by the shift of the
tenure—wage profile in the successive jobs.

Wage gains of movers

are usually estimated by the difference between wage growth of movers and

wage growth of all stayers during the observation period. Heterogeneity in
wage profiles of workers creates a selectivity bias in using all stayers as

the control group. We try to reduce the bias by using a more appropriate
control group, namely of those stayers whose mobility behavior, in addition to
other observable characteristics, is similar to that of current period

movers. Their wage growth on the job proxies for the wage growth foregone by
movers.

wage changes of movers were estimated in the period 1970—1981, as well as
in the more recent subperiod 1976—1981, for white male workers, non—students,

up to age 60. We distinguished subgroups of young (first decade of work
experience) and of all other, more experienced workers. We also distinguished
movers by type of separation, quit and layoff. Other characteristics, such as
education, marital status and union membership were used as independent
variables in tWe statistical regression equations.

Findings in both the shorter and longer run reveal similar facts: Wage
gains of movers are generally positive,' except for layoffs airiong the older

—2—
workers. Wage gains in quits exceed wage gains in layoffs. Wage gains of
older movers are smaller (or even negative) than wages of young movers. This
is partly due to the greater frequency of layoffs (compared to quits) among
older workers.

These systematic patterns are clearly observed, when the mobility wage
gains are related to the group of next—period movers rather than to the less

appropriate control group of all stayers. Indeed, a large part of the gain is
due to the lesser wage growth on the job of movers compared to stayers. This
is consistent with findings in our previous studies, according to which less
frequent movers receive more job training and grow more rapidly on the job.2
This is one reason for the flatter life—time trajectories of frequent

movers. The other, according to our present [indings is that, with the
exception of young workers (especially quits), movers, despite average gains

in moving, do not catch up with wage levels of stayers. This is true mainly
of the more experienced movers.

The adverse effect of layoffs compared to quits on mobility wage gains is
not traceable to differential behavior on the prior job, insofar as it is
reflected in wage levels and wage growth:

Botti are about the same prior to

separation, and lower than among (the average) stayer. However, search
behavior both on the job and off—the—job is apparently different.
Unemployment encountered by most layoffs reduces wage gains, especially if it

is prolonged. Fewer quits enter unemployment which also tends to be shorter
than in layoffs.

A search model which focuses on search efficiency, defined both as search
effort and as personal or environmental (state of the market) search

productivity is capable of explaining differential mobility wage gains by
layoffs relative to quits and by age, as well as by other characteristics such

—3—
as education, marital status, national unemployment, and probably other

criteria which we have not studied. The model suggests that differences in
search efficiency create differences in duration of search (unemployment) and
in acceptance wages, as well as a negative relation between the two.

Differences in costs of search would, of ourse, create a positive
correlation. In our findings differences in search efficiency appear to
dominate.

Although the decline in wage gains of older movers is largely due to the
adverse effects of layoff unemployment (quit unemployment is not as, or not at

all, deleterious), wage gains decline with age in quits as well. The work of
Bartel and Borjas (1981) with NLS data indicates that quits which are
exogenous (for family, health, and other reasons) result in wage losses, and
so do, to a lesser extent, quits which represent trade—offs of wages for

preferred other working conditions. We find one important example of the
latter in our data: Reduced wage gains are traded off for preferred changes
in hours. The phenomenon is significant in the experienced labor force, not
so among the young. We may conclude that the reduction of wage gains in quits
of older workers is due primarily to the greater prevalence of the exogenous
and trade—off categories among them.3

II. Measuring Wage Changes in Transitions
In estimating returns to inter—firm job changes we should distinguish
short—term wage changes obtained in the transition from longer—run changes
represented by a shift in the tenure profile of wages after the move relative

Before we proceed to interpretations of the findings, we turn to
estimates of longer—run effects of mobility shown in Tables 2 and 3, since

they are qualitatively similar to those in Table 1. The layout of Table 2 is
the same as that in Table 1. The coefficients on separation dummies come from
wage change regressions in vhich the dependent and independent variables are
the same as in those underlying Table 1, except that levels of experience and
of tenure are now replaced by annual changes in them.
The job gains (tenure—wage profile shifts) estimated in Table 2 are

numerically larger than the "transition" gains shown in Table 1. This is
pronounced for the younger movers, suggesting perhaps that beyond the
immediate gain, young movers gain also in wage growth on the new job.
Otherwise the pattern of profile shifts by type of separation and by age is
similar to that found for short—run gains in Table 1.

— 13 —

Table 2A shows the significant coefficients of the standardizing
variables: Thus the coefficient of AX2 is negative. This is consistent with
a negative sign on X in Table 1A, since AX2 = 2X+1.

The sign of ATen2 is

similarly negative, but positive for ATen, suggesting a negative effect of

longer tenure on subsequent gain from moving. Increases in unemployment
reduce wage growth as before, though the effects are smaller than in the

shorter—run. Interactions of union membership with separations are generally
positive, probably reflecting moves from non—unionized to unionized firms.
Table 3 shows the job gain (profile shift) estimates obtained by using
prospective (P) and retrospective (R) wage functions in successive cross—

sections.15 G5, the gain relative to all stayers, is the difference between
separation coefficients (Rt —

row (3) minus row (1); Gms ——

of future movers relative to current stayers is (R+i —
row (2); and Gm ——
movers is (Rt —

the gain

row (4) minus

the gain of movers relative to comparable (next period)
— (Rt+i —

i.e.

rows (3 — 1) —

(4 — 2).16

It is reassuring to find that the numerical estimates of the relative

gains G in Table 3 are quite close to those in Table 2. The conclusions are
therefore the same as in Table 2. There is, however, additional information
in Table 3, namely observations on wage levels of movers and stayers before

and after the move. Thus the fact that all coefficients in rows (1) through
(4)

are negative means that movers have lower wages than stayers both in the

old and in the new job, although the discrepancy is reduced by moving. Also,
prior to moving the wage disadvantage (relative to stayers) is about the same
for quits and for layoffs (row 1 in Table 3).

In conjunction with the

findings in Tables 1 and 2 to the effect that wage growth on the job is about
the same for quits and layoffs, it would seem on the whole that there is no
significant difference in on—the—job wage experience of quits and layoffs

— 14 —

prior

to separation.

By moving young quits make up the bulk of the deficit, while older quits

cut it in half only. Young layoffs remove less than half of the deficit,
while older layoffs worsen it if they change it at all. Apparently, it is
behavior during the transition rather than on the job that distinguishes quits

from layoffs. Since mobility does not compensate for the slower wage growth
on the job of frequent movers, their wage trajectories are flatter, and even

flatter for those movers whose separations are dominated by layoffs. However,
in the long run more frequent movers are not distinguishable by quits or
layoff. No significant correlation between frequency of moving and relative
frequencies of quits to layoffs was found among movers in the PSID.

Interaction Effects

Mobility wage gains differ by type of separation and by age, according to

Tables 1—3. Do mobility wage effects differ also by other characteristics,
such as education, experience, tenure, and so on? To detect these
interactions we restrict our observations to episodes of moves. In Table 4,
in the upper panel we show relative wage gains as before. In the lower panel
we show dollar wage gains. In both panels we look at wage changes during the
move (in period t) and before the move (at t—1). The latter are substitutes
for the wage change of stayers who will move in t+1.
We find that both the relative and dollar gains differ by education,
tenure, by health, by location (in SMA), and less significantly by experience

and by marital status. These results are qualitatively similar in the percent
and dollar measures, and are stronger when lagged wage effects (coefficients
in (t—1)) are subtracted from current effects (in t) which refer to current
movers without reference to any comparison group.

— 15

—

Gains from job mobility increase with education, mainly because gains
from quits do. In relative terms the effect of education is negative only in
layoffs of young workers. Note also, in col. (t—1), that more educated
workers tend to quit jobs which are relatively inferior (in terms of wage
growth), and gain more by moving, the more inferior the previous job was.

Gains decline with tenure in a decelerating fashion. They are reduced in ill

health, and they are smaller in SMAs. They are larger (certainly in dollar
terms) for married than for single men. Experience effects are negative and
near significance when health variables are left out.

Recessions (increases in national unemployment) have a stronger negative
effect on wage growth of movers (—3.77 in Table 4 as compared to —2.5% in

Table 1A) than on wage growth of stayers. Thus, the cyclical variability of
real wages is greatest for movers and declines with experience (and/or tenure)

among stayers (Table 1A). Lesser cyclical fluctuations in wages may be
expected of workers who have accumulated more firm—specific capital than
others, or, more generally, carry greater fixed labor costs to employers. The
comparative findings on movers and stayers, young and old, and early vs. later
tenure are consistent with this hypothesis.

IV.

Wage Changes and Unemnt in Job Transitions.

1. Why do gains from quits exceed gains from layoffs?
As was noted in Tables 1—3, gains from quits exceed gains from layoffs in

all groups and periods, both in the transition and in the job sequence. The
differential is rather stable. Gains from quits exceed gains (or losses) from
layoffs by about 4% points. A dummy for (layoffs=1, quits=O) included in the
wage change equations for moves only, indicates the difference. It is shown
in Col. 1 of Table 5.

— 16 —

Explanations of the disadvantage of layoffs in the transition are put
forward by several analysts. Cline (1980) argues that quitters move from
inferior jobs when better jobs become available, while involuntary separations

(layoffs) affect workers in both inferior and superior jobs. The implication
is that the pre—separation wage levels are, on average, higher for layoffs,

while post—separation wages are about the same. Our findings in the
prospective and retrospective regressions of Table 3 show exactly the

opposite: Pre—separation wages of both quits and layoffs are about the same,
both significantly lower than wages of stayers, while post—separation wages,
although not equal to wages of stayers, are lower for layoffs than for

quits. Rosen argues against the asymmetry between layoffs and quits in his
preface to NBEk volume (19b1): "Who initiates the turnover decision should be
irrelevant, since job separations should occur if and only if productivity on

the current job is less than productivity on an alternate job." Rosen adds
the speculation that perhaps layoffs are more heavily selected from unstable
sectors, hence a greater average loss (or lesser gain) may be expected for

layoffs than for quits. This assumes higher (compensatory) wages in unstable
sectors and (some) moves from unstable to stable sectors: While our
prospective regressions are consistent with the symmetry argument, they reject
the unstable sector hypothesis.

A hypothesis that may explain the larger gains of quitters, relies on job

search behavior: Most quitters change jobs directly without intervening
unemployment, while most layoffs are unemployed between jobs. The implied on—
the—job search of quitters carries a reservation wage which exceeds the wages
on the old job (abstracting from non—wage components of the real wage
package), while the reservation wage of the laid—off unemployed searchers is

lower:'7 The

starting

wage on the new job may, but need not, be higher than

— 17 —

on the old job. In our data 2/3 of quits changed jobs without unemployment,
while about the same proportion of layoffs became unemployed. If reservation
wages are indeed lower for unemployed than for employed searchers we should
find that the reduction in wage gains due to unemployment is greater than that

due to layoff. This is shown in Table 5, comparing col. 2 with col. 1.
The disadvantage of searching while unemployed is less significant for
quits than for layoffs (compare col. 4 with col. 6), especially among the more

experienced workers. Quit into unemployment is deliberate ——

it

is likely to

be prompted by high costs of searching on—the—job. It therefore indicates the
intent to search more intensively. Moreover, the intensity of search by
unemployed quitters is likely to be strengthened by lack of unemployment

compensation for which layoffs are eligible. Indeed, average duration'8 ot
layoff unemployment is almost twice as long as of quit unemployment (Shown in
Table 7).

If intensity of search of unemployed quitters is greater than that of

those on layoff, it should also follow that for the same length of search
quitters should be more successful in locating a better (higher wage) job.

This is confirmed in our regression (Table 5) in which a duration variable is

added to the unemployment dummy: The coefficient on duration is not
significant for quits, but is negative and significant on layoffs. That is to
say, that each additional month of unemployment reduces the acceptance wage of

unemployed layoffs by an additional 2.8%. Apparently, longer duration
reflects lesser or decreasing efficiency of search'9 of those laid off, but
not of those who quit,

2. Why do gains from moving decline with age?
(a) Incidence and Duration of Unemployment

According to Table 1, short run gains from separations of experienced

— 18 —

workers (X > 10) are much smaller (about a third) than gains of young
workers. The reduction is somewhat less in quits (about a half), but goes
from positive to negative in layoffs. The use of percent gains may, of
course, be misleading. It is possible for the net dollar gain (the difference
between the dollar gains of movers and the dollar gains of the control—group)

to increase when the percent gain declines. Table 6 below shows that the
gross dollar gain from moving of young workers was larger than the

corresponding gain of older workers. This implies that the net dollar gain
declines as well, given the decline in the percent measures2° (Gm).

As Tables 2 and 3 indicate, the decline in Gm with age is even greater in
our job gain estimates, which are conceptually closer to present values.

One reason for the decline in the wage gain of the older job changers is

that a greater proportion of them experience layoff. The ratio of layoffs to
separations is close to 70% among the older workers, compared to about 50% for

the younger ones. And, as was shown in Table 5, the effects of unemployment
are especially severe for laid off older workers, and more so in prolonged

unemployment, which is more typical of laid off workers. It follows that the
differential effects of unemployment, especially in layoffs explains both the
wage gain differences between quits and layoffs, and the declines of gains for
older job changers.

An explanation of all these patterns, already alluded to, may be found in
differential efficiency of search by type of separation, age, education or

other characteristics of workers or labor markets. Greater efficiency in
search may be a matter of personal efficiency, or greater intensity of search,

or of a more favorable environment. We define it as the probability (p) of
finding a vacancy (whether or not the job is ultimately acceptable) per unit

of time. Of course, p is a function of resources invested in search and of

— 19 —

the

environment, but it will suffice for our purposes to treat it as a

parameter:

2

In the terminology of search models, we argue that, on average, older

workers who separate from jobs have a lesser probability of finding a job per
unit of search time, not because they are holding out for a higher acceptance
wage within the relevant wage offer distribution (though it is true of some),
but because the probability of getting any offer, that is, the probability of

finding a vacancy, is smaller. On this assumption we can show that older
workers who separate will search longer when unemployed, and quit less
frequently, while their acceptance wage will be relatively lower, so the wage
gain will be smaller for older job movers than for younger ones.

In the initially standard search model, the individual samples from his

wage offer distribution f(w) receiving one offer per unit of time. The worker
decides on an optimal wage floor which equates the gain from an additional

unit of search to the cost of it. The resulting rule is:
(1)

p(T
a a —W)=c
a

where Wa is the lowest acceptable wage, a is the probability of getting an

acceptable wage offer, that is, of W > W, Wa the mean of all acceptable wage
offers; c is the (marginal) cost of search which includes opportunity and

other costs. Income offsets z which are contingent on a continued search,
such as unemployment compensation, enter costs with a negative sign. Expected
duration of search D is inverse to

In this model search is longer the

higher the acceptance wage, which is higher the lower cost of search.

However, the probability of accepting a wage offer must be redefined
given that the probability of finding any offer in a unit period can be less

than 1. A lesser frequency of vacancies may be a result of depressed business
conditions in general, or depressed markets for a particular type of labor, or

— 20 —

a function of lesser efficiency or intensity of search. The optimum condition

becomes:

(2) p aa — w) = c
Here p is the probability of finding a job offer, a the probability of
finding an acceptable job conditional on finding a vacancy, and

is the

probability of finding an acceptable job. D is now the inverse of the product
As before, changes in c produce a positive relation between Wa and D.

However, changes in p over the business cycle, or differences in p across
people, are likely to produce a negative correlation between Wa and D.

A reduction in p leads to a downward revision of Wa hence to an increase

will rise or fall when p declines. No

The question is whether

in 1a

perfectly general answer can be given to this question, but a most plausible
answer is that

will fall, hence the duration of search will lengthen

even though Wa is revised downward in consequence of a fall in p. It is easy

to see that the difference (W —

W

)

increases as W is lowered in a uniform

or triangular wage offer distribution. When Wa is reduced, a is reduced by
a smaller amount, so that

must fall if c is fixed or reduced.

The conclusion that a lower p is very likely to produce longer search and
lower acceptance wages holds both for unemployed and for employed searchers.

An increased duration of search on the job, of course, means a reduction in
the frequency of quit.

In sum, workers facing fewer vacancies in their search may be expected to
have a longer duration of search and a lesser wage gain when unemployed, and

to inhibit their job change (quitting) when employed.2 These conclusions are
consistent with worker behavior during the business cycle: duration of
unemployment increases and quits decline while layoffs increase, partly
because employment demand declined and partly to substitute for a decline in

— 21 —

attrition

(quits).

Applying the same model to the life—cycle, we may argue that either p or

c declines at older ages. A decline in c is not plausibe except very early
when labor market entrants become eligible for unemployment compensation. A
decline in c would lead to increases in Wa and in wage gains, but the opposite

is implied by a fall in p and is observed. The implications that older men
have a lesser tendency to quit, a reduced Q/L ratio, and a lower Wa when
changing jobs are confirmed in our data.

The longer duration of unemployment of older workers is a well known

feature of national statistics. In our data this fact is observed in Table 7,
in which duration of unemployment of unemployed job changes is regressed on a

number of variables. In col. (1) and (3) where the variables are restricted
to education and experience, duration initially decreases (over the first half

a dozen years of experience) then increases with experience. When tenure and
other variables are added in Col. (3) and (5), it is lengthening of tenure
that appears to be responsible for the increased duration of unemployment by

age. Apparently, unemployed older movers with longer tenure face greater
hardships in job search —— a fact consistent with the smaller wage gains of
longer tenured movers, observed in Table 4. It is also consistent with losses

of firm and industry specific capital due to structural changes affecting
older, longer tenured workers in manufacturing industries especially.
Sectoral information as well as that on plant closings is required to probe
these matters more deeply.
Looking at the other variables, Table 7 also shows that duration of

unemployment diminishes with education. The hypothesis that the efficiency
parameter (p) increases with education is therefore consistent with both

implications of the search model: greater wage gain (Table 4) and shorter

— 22 —

duration

of unemployment. Similarly duration increases with the level of the

national unemployment rate (Table 7) and wage gains decline (as we saw in

Table 4). Here p reflects the decline of vacancies in recessions. Effects of
health disabilities and of marital status similarly fit the search model:
longer duration of unemployed and smaller wage gain of the disabled, and the

converse for married compared to single men. Finally, if unemployment results
from layoff, its duration is 70% longer than if it results from quit, and as
shown before, the wage gain is far smaller.

(b) Why deains from quits decline with age?
Although the lesser gains from mobility can be in large measure
attributed to unemployed search, wage gains decline also in quits where

unemployment plays a minor and not necessarily deleterious role. In their
study of NLS data, Bartel and Borjas (1981) were able to classify quits into 3

categories: (1) for personal or family non—market reasons, such as change in
health, in family status, and so on), (2) for reasons of dissatisfaction with
working conditions, which they call HpushTl, and (3) "job—related real wage
maximizing reasons which they call upull!!.

Their findings are shown in

Table 8. Quits in the first 2 categories led to lesser wage gains or to
losses, and the incidence of them was greater among old workers (age over 45

in the NLS) than among the younger ones: 75% vs. 57%. Although the gains
estimated by Bartel ana Borjas are calculated relative to all stayers,

therefore probably understated, the differential patterns of gains by age are
consistent with our estimates.

The distinctions within quit categories are not available in our data.
However, the role of changes in non—wage conditions can be explored in one

rather important case, which fits the Bartel and Borjas category (2), namely

— 23 —

when the job change contains a significant change in hours per week. The

different wage—hours schedules offered in different jobs, firms, or industries
are due to various technologically and administratively conditioned systems of
coordination of the production process, as well as to the presence of fixed

labor costs which differ among firms. Consequently, desired changes in hours
are more likely to be accomplished in job transitions than within the

firm.2 Where the change is in the direction opposite to the desired one,
workers must be compensated by an increase in the wage. When the change in
hours is in the desired direction, workers are willing to trade off some of

the acceptance wage for the preferred change in hours. Note that the negative
effect of wages applies whether or not the desired change is negative or
positive, and that the trade—off applies to search and match mobility rather

than to moves in response to wide—spread shifts in demand. In the latter case
wages would rise with increases in hours and decline with decreases. Thus, if
most of job changing which is associated with significant changes in hours, is
not in response to demand fluctuations and is in the direction of preferred
hours, we should expect to see a negative effect of absolute (positive and
negative) changes in hours schectules on the wage gain.

In Table 9 we find that coefficients on the interaction of separations2
and change of hours in wage gains is negative, suggesting that trade—offs

dominate in moves with sizable changes in hours ( hrs > 5 per week, in
absolute value).

We find also that changes in hours do not significantly affect wages of

young workers. Apparently job matching and experimentation applies to work
schedules and other working conditions during the early years of work

experience.2 Since reports on hours worked are conceptually less reliable
for salaried than for hourly rated workers, we show separately effects of

— 24 —

changes in hours in the sample of wage earners. The results are equally
significant, despite the smaller sample size. More importantly, the effects
are observed not merely on starting wages. The effects on the longer run
("job") wage gains are at least as clear and significant.

In demand fluctuations hours decline in downturns and so do real hourly

wages, but the opposite is true in upswings. To test whether we were not
confounding effect of utility trade—offs with demand fluctuations, we also

distinguish increases from decreases in hours. If a negative sign on the
latter dominates, we may have misinterpreted our findings as a utility trade-

off. We find, however, that each of the changes carries a negative
coefficient, not significant for the young, but significant for workers with

more than 10 years of experiences. The trade—off is a 3 to 6 reduction in
wage for over 5 hours change in work schedule for wage and salary earners. It
is between 5 and 8% for wage earners alone.

The illustration of effects of changes in hours on wage gains fits
category (2) of the Bartel and Borjas classification of quits shown in

Table 8. The preponderance of "personal" and "push" types of quits among
older workers explains the anomaly that gains from quits decline with age in

both relative and dollar terms. It is an apparent anomaly, because a
declining payoff period would require increases in gains to induce workers to

move. Note that this requirement is indeed fulfilled in the "pull" category
of quits. Here returns to strictly wage motivated quits are twice as high in
dollar terms for the old movers than for the young ones. The percent gain is
about the same. If the gains are assumed to be permanent, the present value
of older quits is probably not smaller than that of the younger movers.

— 25

10f course, the dispersion is not small. Hence significant numbers of movers
incur losses.
2Mincer and Jovanovic (1981) provide the human capital explanation and limited
empirical evidence. Much stronger evidence is shown in Mincer (1984).
3According to Table 8, about half of quits of young workers are mainly wage
maximizing ("pull"). This is true of only one quarter of older quits.

4me exceptions are Borjas and Rosen (1980), Cline (1980), Mincer (1983) and
Polachek and Horvath (1977). These studies differ both in methodology and in
population coverage.

7Although one might

the wage growth of movers in the year before they

moved, W'' instead of W"1, there are several disadvantages due to
difference in (calendar) period, non—linearity in tenure—wage profiles, and
significant loss of observations, given short tenure of movers.

fact, most of the estimates in the shorter period are similar to those in
the longer period.

13 This index of unemployment is not affected by compositional changes in the
labor force, and it is less likely to reflect supply responses to the business
cycle, as do some of the other demographic components of the aggregate unemployment rate.

14 Bartel and Borjas (1981) term the differential effect of quits and layoffs
"not surprising," while Rosen in his introduction to the 1981 volume calls it
"a puzzle".

'8Our measures of duration of unemployment in Tables 5 and 7 are weeks
unemployed during the year when job change took place. This may represent more
than one spell, and may create some inaccuracy.
'9Although job changers do not, by definition, return to their previous jobs,
some of the unemployed may have expected recall. These expectations may wane
as duration lengthens, resulting in a drop in the reservation wage.

20 Let the gross dollar gain of movers be g and of the control group (movers
who stay) g8. The net dollar gain is therefore g = g — g5. But

For
declines. The decline in Gm is therefore not merely a matter of arithmetic.
It does indicate a decline in the gross dollar gain. Indeed, the relative
measures (Gm) shown in Tables 1—3 would have to increase with age to keep the
net dollar gain from falling.
21This parameter is called the "arrival rate" (of offers) in the mathematical
search literature. In the version that follows, the model was described in
Mincer and Leighton (1982).
22Barron (1975), Feinberg (1977), and Nickel (1979) analyze wider classes of
wage offer distributions, with similar results. These distributions belong to
a more general class of log—concave probability distributions, including
uniform, triangular, normal, and exponential among others. Proofs that such
wage offer distributions generate a negative correlation between our p and D
are given by Flinn and Heckman (1983) and by Burdette and Ondrich (1985).
23We need not assume that p is exogenous. It may decline as a result of the
search process (e.g. Salop, 1973). The distinction is immaterial for our
purposes.
24 See Altonji and Paxson (1985).
25

Altonji and Paxson have similar findings for quits of workers who
previously expressed the desire to change hours.
26

Jso, moves toward higher wages in preference to other components of the
job dominate the mobility of young compared to older workers according to
Table (8) below, taken from Bartel and Borjas (1981).
27 Let i be the discount rate, g0 and g the dollar gains of old and young
movers respectively, and R the remaining payoff period in years. R10 for the
older movers in the NLS, while R=40 for the young, which is almost infinity
for discounting purposes. For the present values of older quits to be no less
