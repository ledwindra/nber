ABSTRACT
What is it about modern capitalist economies that allows them, in contrast to all earlier societies, to
generate sustained growth in productivity and living standards? It is widely agreed that the productivity
growth of the industrialized economies is mainly an ongoing intellectual achievement, a sustained
flow of new ideas. Are these ideas the achievements of a few geniuses, Newton, Beethoven, and a
handful of others, viewed as external to the activities of ordinary people? Are they the product of a
specialized research sector, engaged in the invention of patent-protected processes over which they
have monopoly rights? Both images are based on important features of reality and both have inspired
interesting growth theories, but neither seems to me central. What is central, I believe, is that fact that
the industrial revolution involved the emergence (or rapid expansion) of a class of educated people,
thousands–now many millions–of people who spend entire careers exchanging ideas, solving work-related
problems, generating new knowledge.

What is it about modern capitalist economies that allows them, in contrast to all
earlier societies, to generate sustained growth in productivity and living standards?
It is widely agreed that the productivity growth of the industrialized economies is
mainly an ongoing intellectual achievement, a sustained flow of new ideas. Are these
ideas the achievements of a few geniuses, Newton, Beethoven, and a handful of others,
viewed as external to the activities of ordinary people? Are they the product of a
specialized research sector, engaged in the invention of patent-protected processes
over which they have monopoly rights? Both images are based on important features
of reality and both have inspired interesting growth theories, but neither seems to me
central. What is central, I believe, is that fact that the industrial revolution involved
the emergence (or rapid expansion) of a class of educated people, thousands–now
many millions–of people who spend entire careers exchanging ideas, solving workrelated problems, generating new knowledge.

In this paper I introduce and partially develop a new model of technological change,
viewed as the product of a class of problem-solving producers. The model is built up
from the premise that all knowledge resides in the head of some individual person,
so that the knowledge of a firm, or economy, or any group of people is simply a list
of the knowledge of its members. A main feature of the model will be the social or
reciprocal character of intellectual activity: Each person gains from the knowledge of
the people around him; his ideas in turn stimulate others.1
As we will see, this idea is very flexible, but to develop it we need to have a tractable
mathematical idealization of an individual’s knowledge, of the relation of this knowledge to his productivity, and of the process by which new knoweledge is aquired.
Everything in this paper is based on the Kortum (1997) model of the technology
frontier, a diﬀerential equation describing the evolution of the production frontier
introduced in Eaton and Kortum (1999), and an adaptation of this equation due to
Alvarez, Buera, and Lucas (2007). The necessary details are provided in the next section, in the context of a one-good economy with a labor-only production technology.
In Section 2, a cohort structure is introduced, so that individual careers will have a
beginning, middle, and end, as they do in reality. Section 3 discusses the possibility
of using cross-section evidence on individual earnings, in addition to aggregate data,
to calibrate the model. Section 4 considers the incorporation of schooling into the
cohort model. Section 5 contains conclusions and further speculations.

Jones (2005) surveys and contributes to a number of papers with a motivation similar to mine,

dating back to Arrow (1962). Indeed, my title is just a permutation of Jones’. I was also influenced
by Jovanovic and Rob (1989) and Chatterjee and Rossi-Hansberg (2007) who also focus, in diﬀerent
ways, on ideas and problem-solving.

1. The Technology Frontier
Kortum (1997) and Eaton and Kortum (1999) consider models in which diﬀerent
agents have diﬀerent knowledge and a description of the state of knowledge of an
economy requires the entire distribution of knowledge over individual agents. Kortum
(1997) calls this distribution the technology frontier, a usage I will follow here. In
diﬀerent applications, an “agent” can be a firm, a plant, or even an entire country. In
this paper, an agent will be an individual person and the knowledge of any collection
of people is just the distinct, privately held knowledge of the individuals that comprise
it. I will thus interpret Eaton and Kortum’s theory in the style of Jovanovic (1979),
as a stochastic process model of individual careers.
To begin, we consider an economy with continuum of infinitely-lived people. Each
person has one unit of labor per unit of time, and labor is the only factor of production.
Everyone produces the same, single, non-storable good, which I will call simply GDP.
The productivity of each person–the amount he can produce per unit of time–is
a random variable z, say. The distribution of these individual productivities at any
date t is the technology frontier, represented by the cdf G(·, t) (and density g(·, t)) of
z. Then GDP per person in this economy is
Z ∞
y(t) =
zg(z, t)dz.
0

The productivity of any individual evolves as follows. Suppose he has the productivity z at date t, viewed as a draw from the date-t technology frontier G(·, t). Over
the time interval (t, t + h) he gets αh independent draws from another distribution,
with cdf H.2 Let y denote the best of these draws. Then at t + h his productivity
will be the higher of his original productivity z and the best of his new ideas y, or
max(z, y). It follows that the probability that he has the same productivity z at t + h
as he had at t is the probability he does not get any better ideas between t and t + h,
2

A non-integer number of draws? Bear with me.

3

or
G(z, t + h) = G(z, t) × Pr{all αh draws ≤ z}
= G(z, t)H(z)αh .
Take logs, divide by h and let h → 0 to get
∂ log (G(z, t))
= α log (H(z, t))) .
∂t
So if we know the source distribution H(·, t) of ideas and the initial frontier distribution G(z, 0) we know the complete evolution of the frontier.
As is clear from Eaton and Kortum’s work, this set-up can be developed in a variety
of ways. For my purposes here, I want to close the system and obtain an endogenous
growth theory. To do this, nothing more is involved than equating H and G, which
is to say assuming that the source of everyone’s ideas is other people in the same
economy. In this case, we have the autonomous equation
∂ log (G(z, t))
= α log (G(z, t))) .
∂t

(1.1)

Equation (1.1) tells us is that everyone’s productivity is always improving, unless
there is a maximum productivity level (a z value that G(z, 0) = 1) and someone has
attained it. But we already knew this much from the verbal statement of the problem.
To get beyond this, more structure is needed. I will get it by setting up a specific,
parametric model of the process, also due to Eaton and Kortum. We view each person
at t as a random draw x from an exponential distribution with parameter λ(t) > 0:
the density function is λ(t)e−λ(t)x . His productivity–the units of GDP he can produce
in a year–is x−θ , θ > 0. In this parameterization, the cdf G above becomes
G(z, t) = Pr(x−θ ≤ z}
= Pr(x ≥ z −1/θ }
= e−λ(t)z
4

−1/θ

.

Then log(G(z, t)) = −λ(t)z −1/θ and the diﬀerential equation (1.1) becomes
−

dλ(t) −1/θ
= −αλ(t)z −1/θ
z
dt

or, cancelling, simply
dλ(t)
= αλ(t).
dt

(1.2)

We can say that productivities have a Frechet distribution with parameters (λ, θ).
Instead of tracking the entire distribution G we can track the single parameter λ(t),
the only changing feature of the distribution. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the implied
dynamics of the technology frontier and Figure 3 provides a sample of individual
realized productivity paths.
The fact that the Frechet form is “preserved” by the above matching process is a
common-sense application of a well-known feature of the exponential distribution: If
x and y are mutually independent random variables, exponentially distributed with
parameters λ and µ, then z = min(x, y) is exponentially distributed with parameter
λ + µ. This feature carries over in an obvious way to the Frechet productivity distributions, since max(x−θ , y −θ ) = [min(x, y)]−θ = z −θ . The parameter θ does not change.
In the process of meeting others an exchanging ideas, both parties in the matched
pair (x, y) emerge with productivity max(x−θ , y −θ ). The eﬀect of this on the motion
of the frontier is completely described by the motion of the single parameter λ(t).3
Total GDP in the economy, so parameterized, is
3

The diﬀerential equation (1.1) is based on the assumption that new ideas arrive at a deterministic

rate. An alternate assumption, applied for example in Eaton and Kortum (1999), would be to assume
stochastic, Poisson arrivals of new ideas. The practical advantage of (1.1), for my purposes here, is
that it preserves the exact exponential distribution. Poisson arrivals do not. These two approaches
are compared more systematically in Alvarez, Buera, and Lucas (2007).

where A is the gamma function evaluated at 1−θ. Convergence of the integral requires
that θ < 1, which I assume to hold throughout the paper. The implied GDP growth
rate is αθ.
One way to proceed from this point would be to view this model of idea flows
and individual productivity as a theory of the growth of the eﬀective labor input,
and to introduce preferences, physical capital accumulation–the entire apparatus
of neoclassical growth theory. The details of these extensions are familar, but I
will continue–for simplicity only–to work with a labor-only technology. In any
case, notice that with or without physical capital, the mystery of TFP growth has
disappeared!4 Later on we will estimate θ from the variability of individual earnings,
but the parameter α–the rate at which ideas are processed–remains free. For the
U.S., for example, we could simply calibrate α to the value (.02)/θ, once we have θ,
and per capita GDP growth will be “explained” as much as it will ever be by a purely
economic theory. Moreover, the parameterization of the model invites us to think
about the sources of growth in an organized way, in terms of its three constituent
parameters: each agent’s own eﬀorts and ability to process ideas, α, the average
quality of his environment, λ, and the diversity of his environment, θ.
To this point, I have not introduced any individual allocative decisions into this
economy. One could, for example, assume that a person’s learning rate α varies with
the way he allocates his time or with his choice of occupation, and of course such
modifications would be easy to carry out. In Section 5, I illustrate by considering a
4

schooling choice. But it should already be clear that the social returns from actions
to aﬀect α will exceed their private return. An individual will take into account
the eﬀect of such action on his own productivity but not its external eﬀect on the
intellectual environment of others, as summarized in the parameter λ.5
2. A Cohort Structure
Individual contributions to the growth of knowledge vary widely, depending on
diﬀerences in people’s ability and in the way they allocate their time. The reason
we need a theory of knowledge creation is to gain the ability to analyze the eﬀects
of such individual diﬀerences. The approach taken in the last section will be useful,
then, only insofar as it can be adapted to situations in which agents diﬀer in more
fundamental respects than in their random productivity draws.
In particular, a theory of technology focused on individually held knowledge must
face up to mortality and the loss of knowledge it entails. Some knowledge can be
“embodied” in books, blueprints, machines, and other kinds of physical capital, and
we know how to introduce capital into a growth model, but we also know that doing
so do not by itself provide an engine of sustained growth. To deal with mortality we
need to introduce a cohort structure with overlapping generations.6
To keep things simple I assume a stationary age distribution, with density π(s) and
5

This externality is related to the external eﬀects in Romer (1986) and Lucas (1988), but in both

these papers the eﬀect is on the level of others’ productivity, not on their learning rate. A closer
precedent is the learning in Arrow (1962), though it is there linked to the accumulation of physical
capital.
6
We know that an overlapping generations model without a family structure and a bequest motive
is inadequate to analyze the holdings of physical capital. These are good reasons to prefer a model of
households as infinitely-lived “dynasties.” But even within a perfectly functioning family, knowledge
is lost with deaths and “replacement investment” in new members is needed. See Stokey (1991).

π(v)dv = fraction of people with age ≤ s.

The birth rate π(0) is constant. There is no immigration, so π(s) is non-increasing.
As before, everyone’s individual productivity is x−θ , where 0 < θ < 1 and x is an
exponentially distributed random variable. For a person of age s at date t, we view
x as a draw from an exponential distribution with parameter µ(t, s). We assume as
well that the technology frontier for the entire society is Frechet distributed, with
parameters λ(t) and θ. It remains to relate the parameters λ(t) and µ(t, s).
We first define the economy’s knowledge λ(t) in terms of the knowledge levels x−θ of
individuals in the economy at date t. For the cohort of age s, productivities are Frechet
distributed random variables with parameters (µ(t, s), θ). Consider an individual
meeting others over (t, t + h). If everyone is met with equal probability (a convenient
and also easily varied assumption), then the fraction π(s)ε of the draws an individual
gets are from people of ages in (s, s + ε). As discussed in the last section, I treat this
as as single draw from an exponential with parameter αhπ(s)εµ(t, s). The parameter
of the distribution of the minimum of all these draws is then approximately
Z ∞
λ(t) =
π(s)µ(t, s)ds.

Next we define the cohort parameters µ(t, s) in terms of current and past knowledge
levels of λ(t). The initial state of the economy is specified by the cohort parameters
µ(0, s), s ≥ 0, that describe the population at t = 0. (These parameters determine
λ(0) as in (2.1), but in general the function µ(0, s) conveys more relevant information
than can be summarized in a single number.) Those alive at t will continue to learn
from the rest of the population until they die (leave the labor force), as described by:

The integral equation (2.4) contains the complete description of equilibrium behavior. It is an immediate consequence of Picard’s theorem on the existence of solutions
to diﬀerential equations that for any continuous µ(0, s), s ≥ 0, there is exactly one
continuous function λ(t), t ≥ 0, satisfying (2.4).
In the rest of this section we characterize these solutions as fully as possible, taking up in turn the existence and character of balanced growth paths, the complete
dynamics of all solution paths when the age distribution is exponential, and finally
the complete dynamics with general age distributions.
Consider first candidate solutions to (2.4) of the form λ(t) = Beγt . I will refer to
such a solution as a balanced growth path (BGP). Any BGP must have (B, γ) that

The right side of (2.6) is a strictly increasing, strictly concave function of γ. It takes
the value 0 at γ = 0 and (2.6) exactly one non-zero solution as well. (See Figure 4).

This inequality involves the product of the rate α at which ideas are processed and
R∞
the mean working life 0 sπ(s)ds. Thus a BGP with positive growth can occur only

if (2.7) holds and then only at the unique positive γ value that satisfies (2.6). In
this theory, a productive idea needs to be in use by a living person to be acquired
by someone else, so what one person learns is available to others only as long as he
remains alive. If lives are too short or too dull, sustained growth at a positive rate is
impossible.
We focus first on the case that is consistent with growth: γ > 0. For this case, it
is convenient to use the change of variable x(t) = e−γt λ(t), and to restate (2.4) as

We already know that (2.8) has a unique solution for any continuous, bounded

bounded µ(0, ·), the unique solution x of (2.8) satisfies
lim T n x0 = x

n→∞

(2.9)

for all x0 ∈ S+ . Thus we can calculate a fixed point x or establish its properties by
using the successive approximations from any starting point x0 .
11

We will use this fact in a moment to establish a stability theorem for this case
γ > 0. But it is instructive to begin the discussion of stability with the special case
of exponential lives: π(s) = δe−δs . In this case, (2.4) becomes

which has the solutions γ = 0 and γ = α − δ. (Note that α − δ > 0 is the inequality
R∞
α 0 sπ(s)ds > 1 in the case of exponential π.) One can verify directly that
λ(t) = λ(0)e(α−δ)t
In this case with γ > 0, then, all solutions are balanced growth paths, with λ(t)
growing at the constant rate γ from any initial level λ(0). Then the normalized paths
x(t) = e−γt λ(t) are all constant at their initial levels x(0).
In the general case, the initial conditions µ(s, 0) cannot be summarized in a single
number λ(0) or x(0), but we can prove that growth rates converge to constants and
levels will always depend on initial conditions. Specifically, we have
Theorem: If γ > 0 and if x is any solution to (2.8),
lim x(t) = B for some B > 0.

(Note that in general it will not be the case that B = x(0), and that this theorem
does not provide an algorithm for mapping initial conditions µ(s, 0) into limiting

This completes the discussion of the case γ > 0. When γ = 0, a BGP λ(t) will be
constant at some level B. say. Working back, the values for µ(0, s) consistent with
this are
µ(0, s) = αBs,

We have thus catalogued the possible balanced growth paths, the initial conditions
that will induce them, and their stability properties.
3. Issues of Identification and Calibration
In the models of the last two sections two parameters, the idea-processing rate α and
the Frechet variance parameter θ, combine to determine the rate γ of technological
change. Unless we can find other sources of evidence on α and θ this hardly seems an
advance over simply assuming a given γ value, as in the original Solow model. These
models are a little too abstract to support a full discussion of this issue, but I want to
explore it in a preliminary way in this section. The cohort model of Section 2 predicts
the entire age-earnings (or experience-earnings) profiles for everyone in the economy
and the way these profiles evolve over time. There is a vast amount of evidence on
individual earnings for the U.S. economy. Why not use some of it to test the model
and to estimate its parameters?
To do this, I will use earnings from the 1990 U.S. census, viewing these data as
though they were observations on a balanced growth path of the theoretical, laboronly economy. These earnings data are broken down by sex, race and schooling levels
attained as well as by age, so some decisions need to be made as to how model and
data are to be matched. In this section, I treat white, male heads of households who
have graduated from high school and not gone on to college as constituting the entire
population and use their yearly earnings as the measure of productivity. This will
be adequate to illustrate the main identification and calibration issues. In the next
section, I consider the eﬀects of schooling diﬀerences.
From the data, I calculated mean log earnings and the variance of the log of earnings
14

for each age group (among the set of male high school gradusates). Figure 5 displays
the cell log means, based on a sample extracted from the 1990 U.S. Census.7 It also
shows means for two other schooling levels (out of 17 provided), but I will not make
any use of these in this section. The census provides earnings for workers up to age
90, but these fall oﬀ rapidly after age 60. I deleted these older workers from the figure
since partial retirement is important for yearly earnings of old workers and the theory
does not accommodate this.
Along the theoretical balanced growth path, the earnings of a person of age s are
random variables x−θ , where x has an exponential distribution with the parameter

Figure 6 is a plot of the standard deviations of log earnings against age for the
same three schooling levels used in Figure 5. The theory is based on a constant θ
but one can see a clear upward trend in the earnings variability of both high school
and college graduates. I will comment on this in a moment. For now, I will press
on and use the high school graduates to form an estimate of 0.6 for the log standard
√
deviation, implying–from (3.2)–the estimate θ = ( 6/π)(0.6) ' 0.5. (If the college
graduates were used instead, the estimate would be about 0.58.)
The growth rate of GDP per capita in the theoretical economy is θγ. Using the
U.S. growth rate of about 2 percent per year, this implies the estimate (.02)/θ = .04
for the parameter γ. Finally, to estimate the learning rate α we need to use equation
(2.6). I specialized the age distribution π(s) to a rectangular distribution with a
working life of T years to obtain

(3.3)

Then γ = .04 and T = 44 together implied α = 0.075.

So far I have used only the standard deviations plotted in Figure 6 and an estimate
of the earnings growth for the economy as a whole to estimate the parameters α, θ and
γ. With these parameters determined, the only free parameter in the theoretical ageearnings profile (3.1) is the intercept K +θγt: The slope and curvature are completely
determined. Figure 7 plots the predicted curve against the empirical profiles for three
schooling levels, with intercepts of the three curves separately determined. The fits
are a striking confirmation of the theory.8
One can see on Figure 7 that the fits deteriorate for workers over 55. The on-the-job
8

Park (1997) developes a model in which the young learn from the old on the job. In his

analysis, these eﬀects are internalized within firms: young workers in eﬀect pay tuition to their
older colleagues. The theory has implications for age-earnings profiles, and for the equilibrium age
composition of firm workforces as well.

16

learning models of Rosen (1976) and Heckman (1976) fit this earnings decline phase
for active workers well, with theories where workers need to devote eﬀort (in the form
of foregone production) to maintain their learning rate. As retirement nears, the
incentive to do this diminishes. In my model, learning is a by-product of production,
not an alternative use of time, and this eﬀect is absent. It would be a useful but
challenging task to integrate the two models.
The fact that the variance of log earnings increases with age, rather than remaining
constant, does not much eﬀect the accuracy of the calibration, but it is a symptom of
a diﬃculty with the theory that should not be ignored. The observation itself is very
solid. It shows up in earlier censuses (see Heckman et al. (2006)). It is documented
by Deaton and Paxson (1994) using household survey data from the U.S., the U.K.,
and Taiwan. It should be clear from my mathematical development of this model,
not to mention all of the applications in trade theory stemming from Eaton and
Kortum (2002), that if most if not all of the convenience of the model is lost if θ is
not constant. On the other hand, as the cohort analysis in Section 2 makes clear,
the theory can easily accommodate mixtures of populations with diﬀerent λ or µ
parameters. Perhaps the increasing trend we see in the empirical variances can be
viewed as arising from mixtures, changing over time, of diﬀerent populations with
constant, common θ values. At present, this is obviously pure speculation.
The calibration strategy illustrated in this section treats stochastic productivity
shocks, drawn by all workers from a common distribution, as the only sources of
earnings variability. This is obviously not the case for the economy as a whole, as
I have already acknowledged implicitly by treating the subset of male high school
In Rosen (1972), knowledge accumulated on the job is firm-specific, owned by firms. Rosen argues
that some, though not all, learning can be internalized in this way.
In Prescott and Boyd (1987) external eﬀects among workers are also fully internalized. In their
model these eﬀects generate sustained growth.

graduates as though it were the entire labor force. But even within this group,
or within any group defined by observable characteristics, unobserved diﬀerences in
ability will be an added source of earnings variation. Estimation of the Frechet
parameter θ, interpreted as I am doing in this paper, requires taking a position on
the relative importance of diﬀerent sources of earnings variability, for diﬀerent subsets
of the workforce.
4. A Schooling Decision
To this point I have focused on modeling a technology of producing and learning,
taking individual behavior as given. In this section I introduce an element of decision
making by assuming that the idea-processing rate α depends on years of schooling:
α = α(S), an idea proposed long ago by Nelson and Phelps (1966) and recently applied
by Benhabib and Spiegel (2002), and that years of schooling is a matter of individual
choice. Examining the schooling decision will give a clearer idea of the nature of the
gap between private and social returns that I view as a central implication of the
view of technology I am applying here. It will also expose some serious problems in
interpreting evidence on earnings, schooling, and economic growth.
I begin by setting out the notation for a symmetric equilibrium in an economy of
identical (except for age) people, where everyone begins with S years of school. This
is just a slight variation on the economy of Sections 2 and 3. Then I consider an
individual’s choice of his own schooling S taking everyone else’s choice as given. The
first-order condition for this problem will help to determine the equilibrium schooling
level. Then we can compare this equilibrium schooling level to the eﬃcient level.
Let the productivity at date t of a person of age s who has S years of schooling
be x−θ , where x is drawn from an exponential distribution with parameter µ(t, s, S).
Given S, the basic equations are

18

λ(t) =

The mathematical analysis of this equation proceeds exactly as the analysis of (2.4):
only the parameter S is new. In particular, on a balanced growth path Beγt with
constant S, the parameter γ must satisfy

γ

The mean log earnings of his cohort at t is

w(s, t) = K + θγt + θ log(α(S)) + θ log(1 − e−γ(s−S) ).

(4.6)

Equations (4.4)-(4.6) are just restatements of (2.4), (2.6), and (3.1) with a given
level S of schooling imposed. Note that the experience-earnings profiles (4.6) are parallel curves–again, see Figure 6. The schooling term α(S) aﬀects only the intercept.
This is a point in favor of the model: See Heckman et al. (2006).
19

Suppose, then, that the balanced path corresponding to a particular S is an equilibrium, in the sense that no individual worker will choose a schooling level diﬀerent
from S. To describe the S value that has this property we need to describe the individual opportunity sets. For discussion purposes, assume that earnings risks can be
perfectly insured and that anyone can borrow and lend any amount at a market rate
r. A person born at t = 0 will then choose a schooling level S so as to maximize the
present value of expected earnings

That is, an eﬃciency-seeking planner would take into account the eﬀects of each
person’s schooling on the productivity of others and well as on his own productivity.9
This diﬀerence between the private and social returns to schooling will show up in any
equilibrium in which individual agents make choices that aﬀect their learning rates.
These issues certainly merit a quantitative investigation, but there are two reasons
why the model I have sketched here is not equal to the task. In the first place, a
quantitative analysis requires an estimate of the function α(S) relating schooling to
the idea-processing rate, and hence to the growth rate. It would seem natural to
use the earnings diﬀerences between, say, high school and college graduates for this
purpose. For example, the college and high-school intercepts used in Figure 7 diﬀer
by 10.9 - 10.4 = 0.5: a factor of 1.65. We could think an equilibrium of identical
agents, all indiﬀerent at their high school graduation between going to work and
proceeding to a four year college degree. But this thought experiment carried out
with the above model implies an internal rate of return on the order of twice the U.S.
after-tax return on capital: an untenable conclusion. It seems certain that part of
9

In fact, an eﬃciency-seeking planner will have a discounted expected utility objective rather

than take an interest rate as given, and will take transition dynamics into account as well. This is a
complicated but tractable optimal growth problem–deterministic since the idiosyncratic risks can
be pooled–but it is clear without working through the details that its solution will not be replicated
by an equilibrium in which individuals maximize (4.8) taking γ as given.

21

the college premium in the census data reflects diﬀerence in abilities between high
school graduates that finish college and those that do not continue past high school,
or diﬀerences in school quality, or capital market imperfections, or a mix of all three.
See Heckman et al. (2008) for a detailed discussion of these and other diﬃculties in
the economic interpretation of the census evidence.
A second diﬃculty with the balanced growth paths in the model of this section
is the joint prediction of a constant rate of productivity growth, constant schooling
levels, and a positive growth eﬀect of schooling levels–α0 (S) > 0. It is not an easy
task to reconcile these features with the enormous increase in schooling over the past
century. Goldin and Katz (1999) refer to “the race between schooling and technology.”
Perhaps it is the case that the idea processing captured by the parameter α requires
more and more schooling as the technology level λ increases, and we should write
α(S, λ) in place of α(S).10
5. Conclusions and Speculations
A theory of endogenous growth should oﬀer more than a pretty story about parameters that, in practice, we simply treat as unalterable givens. It should help us
to think operationally about the way changes in the way time and other resources
are allocation can have diﬀerential eﬀects on productivity growth. This is the virtue
of Romer’s (1990) and Grossman and Helpman’s (1991) models of inventive activity in patent-protected products, set in environments of imperfect competition. But
my own sense is that patents and “intellectual property” more generally play a very
modest role in the overall growth of production-related knowledge. I have sought a
formulation that emphasizes individual contributions of large numbers of people, in
which the role of market power is minimized, models that oﬀer natural connections
between theoretical variables and observeables.
10

There is a good discussion of this problem and possible resolutions in Jones (2002).

22

The view of endogenous technical change that I have examined in this paper is new
to me, and my first concern was to develop the formal properties of the theory and to
consider, in general way, what kind of evidence could be used to get information on its
key parameters. For these purposes I used an abstract economy consisting entirely
of a homogeneous class of problem-solving producers of single good and spent most
of my time on matters of pure technology. The discussion of schooling in Section 4
was the only allocation problem I considered explicitly. But the linearity of the basic
equations (1.2) or (2.4) makes it easy to think about multi-sectoral models, in which
the class studied here is but one of several, each with its own α or λ or both. In
such a setting, one could think about decisions to enter an occupation or industry, to
migrate, to trade, to invest abroad, as decisions that aﬀect the flows of ideas within
and across economies.

Erratum
Robert E. Lucas, Jr.
April 8, 2010

Hyun Lee has brought to my attention an error in Section II of my paper “Ideas and
Growth" (Economica 76 (2009) 1-19). In the analysis of equation (10) the assertion
is made that the operator T defined on p.9 is a contraction with modulus α/γ. But
it is an essential feature of the theory that α/γ is larger than one so this ratio cannot
serve as a modulus (which must, of course, be less than one). In this note I outline
briefly the way this mistake aﬀects the analysis.
As remarked on p.7 of the paper, the proof that (6) (and hence (10) as well) has a
unique solution on [0, ∞) is a standard argument, based on the fact that the operator
T is a contraction on any interval [t, t + τ ) provided that ατ < 1. The interval length
τ can always be chosen so that this holds.
The erroneous claim that T is a contract on the entire real line was only used to
prove the stability theorem on p.10, to the eﬀect that
lim x(t) = B

t→∞

for some B > 0

for all solutions x(t) to (10). If true, this theorem would imply that the economy
will end up on one of the balanced growth paths analyzed in the paper, for all initial
conditions and for all mortality distributions. But I have not succeeded either in
establishing this result or in constructing a counterexample (such as a solution to
(10) with undamped oscillations).
