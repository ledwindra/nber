    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper presents estimates of the effects of the drinking age and\nbeer taxes on youth motor vehicle mortality. The data set employed is a\ntime series, from 1975 to 1981, of cross sections of the 48 contiguous states.\nSeparate regressions for 15 to 11 year olds, 18 to 20 year olds and\n21 to 24 year olds are presented. A simultaneous estimation model is used\nto account for the endogeneity .of the drinking age. The results show that\nduring the sample period an increase in the drinking age to 21, which is\napproximately 8 percent, would have reduced mortality in the 18 to 20 year\nold group by approximately 14 percent. Also a 100 percent increase in the\nreal beer tax, which is approximately $1.50 per case, would reduce highway\nmortality of 18 to 20 year olds by about 19 percent. This increase in the\nbeer tax would also reduce mortality by about 8 percent for 15 to 17 year\nolds and by about 18 percent for the 21 to 24 year olds.\n\n",
