    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper explores the means by which warfare influences domestic commodity markets.  It is argued that England during the French Wars provides an ideal testing ground.  Four categories of explanatory variables are taken as likely sources of documented changes in English commodity price dis-integration during this period: weather, trade, policy, and wartime events.  Empirically, increases in price dispersion are related to all of the above categories.  However, the primary means identified by which warfare influenced domestic commodity market integration was through international trade linkages and the arrival of news regarding wartime events.\n\n",
