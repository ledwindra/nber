We use numerical general equilibrium techniques to generate counter examples to the widely held view that (in the competitive case) incorporating quality upgrading will tend to reduce the welfare costs of quality invariant trade barriers.  To do this, we use a trade-distorted equilibrium as the reference point, rather than free trade.\n\n",
