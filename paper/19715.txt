ABSTRACT
This paper studies the interaction between capital reallocation and business cycles. Capital reallocation
is pro-cyclical and leads to variations in measured aggregate productivity. Using a simulated method
of moments approach, different sources of aggregate fluctuations are studied to assess their ability
to match both capital reallocation and business cycle moments. A model economy driven by exogenous
variations in the distribution of reallocation costs does remarkably well in matching these moments.
These shocks induce changes in capital reallocation and cause endogenous variations in the Solow
residual. Analytically a higher-order moment is needed to solve the model accurately and is an integral
component connecting reallocation with aggregate productivity.

Abstract
This paper studies the interaction between capital reallocation and business cycles. Capital reallocation is pro-cyclical and leads to variations in measured aggregate
productivity. Using a simulated method of moments approach, different sources of
aggregate fluctuations are studied to assess their ability to match both capital reallocation and business cycle moments. A model economy driven by exogenous variations
in the distribution of reallocation costs does remarkably well in matching these moments. These shocks induce changes in capital reallocation and cause endogenous
variations in the Solow residual. Analytically a higher-order moment is needed to
solve the model accurately and is an integral component connecting reallocation with
aggregate productivity.

Motivation

In a given year, about 6% of the existing capital stock of US public companies is reallocated
between firms. This reallocation is sizeable, adding up to almost a quarter of total investment. As emphasized by Eisfeldt and Rampini (2006), capital reallocation is pro-cyclical. In
booms, a larger fraction of the existing capital stock is reallocated than during recessions.

The nature of that interaction is less clear: (i) do business cycles cause capital reallocation
or (ii) do business cycles arise as a consequence of capital reallocation?
This paper finds support for the second perspective: pro-cyclical reallocation generates
aggregate fluctuations. The mechanism that fits both reallocation and business cycle facts
best is initiated by variations in the distribution of reallocation costs. When reallocation is
less costly, the consequent reassignment of capital to more productive firms induces variations
in the Solow residual. Traditional business cycle features, driven by consumption smoothing
and intertemporal substitution, naturally follow from the movement in the Solow residual.
The analysis is based upon a planner’s problem in which heterogeneous firms differ in
idiosyncratic productivity and their cost of adjusting capital. This problem is of interest
in its own right because it highlights the role of cross sectional moments of capital and
productivity at the plant-level in determining the optimal allocation.
In the context of this model, we study the quantitative implications of different aggregate shocks that affect capital reallocation. Variations in reallocation can result either
from changes in the benefits or the costs. We model changes in the costs of reallocation
through variations in the adjustment frictions. Variations in the benefits of reallocation occur through (i) traditional shocks to total factor productivity as in the real business cycle
model, (ii) shocks to the standard deviation of plant-level productivity, and (iii) time-varying
uncertainty.
Our first result is that a model with stochastic reallocation costs best matches the moments associated with the reallocation of capital. This finding is consistent with the conclusion of Eisfeldt and Rampini (2006) who argue that in order to match the capital reallocation
moments alone, the costs of reallocation must be countercyclical. The competing models fail
in one dimension or another. For the economy driven by TFP shocks alone, the magnitude
of fluctuations in reallocation relative to output does not match the data. In the case of
dispersion shocks, in order to generate pro-cyclical reallocation, the dispersion must be procyclical, contrary to evidence (e.g. (Eisfeldt and Rampini, 2006; Bloom, 2009; Kehrig, 2011;
Bachmann and Bayer, 2014; Kehrig and Vincent, 2017)). The uncertainty model is unable
to generate pro-cyclical capital reallocation.
We then ask whether the model with randomness in the distribution of adjustment costs is
also able to match traditional business cycle moments and thus explain business cycles as well.
Our second result is that this is indeed the case. Variations in the Solow residual induced
through reallocation are large. From the perspective of this model, recessions are not due to
reductions in TFP but rather to increases in the costs of capital reallocation. Quantitatively,
the key is that the variations in the adjustment costs can both generate the amount of capital
reallocation found in the data and induce movements in the Solow residual of the magnitude
2

needed to match business cycle moments. Once the Solow residual is impacted, the standard
mechanisms of the traditional real business cycle model generate pro-cyclical consumption
and investment as well as the relative standard deviations of consumption and investment
found in the data. Each of the other models can match some dimensions of the data but
only the setting with stochastic adjustment costs captures both reallocation and business
cycle variations.
Relative to the literature emerging from Krusell and Smith (1998), almost all papers find
that approximating a joint distribution with its first moment is sufficient and higher order
moments are not necessary.1 A third result of our paper is that in the presence of adjustment
cost (and other) shocks, higher order moments do matter. The covariance between capital
and productivity appears in the state vector of the planner’s problem and plays a central
role in generating the cyclical properties of reallocation and the dispersion in the average
productivity of capital. Moreover, this covariance is a slow-moving object and thus creates
endogenous propagation. The fact that a higher order moment matters for determining the
optimal allocation is indicative of the significance of reallocation effects. The covariance
reflects the cyclical gains to capital reallocation. If it was not needed for characterizing
optimal allocations, then reallocation could not have a cyclical effect on aggregate output.
The idea that frictions in the reallocation process lead to the misallocation of factors of
production (relative to a frictionless benchmark) and affect aggregate productivity lies at
the heart of the analysis of productivity both within and across countries in Maksimovic and
Phillips (2001), Hsieh and Klenow (2009), Bartelsman, Haltiwanger, and Scarpetta (2013)
Restuccia and Rogerson (2008), Osotimehin (2019), and others. A novel feature of our
analysis is the cyclical dimension.
Eisfeldt and Rampini (2006) was the first paper to document that capital reallocation
is pro-cyclical, while the benefits to reallocation are countercyclical.2 We add to their work
by linking this evidence with a model with aggregate fluctuations, explicitly modeling a
feedback mechanism from reallocation to aggregate productivity.

Reallocation and productivity

To fix basic ideas, consider an economy without aggregate shocks.3 The economy is composed of a representative household and a mass of firms distinguished by productivity and
adjustment costs. We first discuss the basic environment. An important derivation links the
Solow residual to the cross sectional distribution of capital. Then the stationary equilibrium
is computed and matched to a subset of moments.

2.1

Environment

The production function at any plant is
y(k, ε) = Aεk α ,

(1)

where A is (fixed) aggregate TFP, and k is the capital used at the plant with idiosyncratic
productivity ε.4
Idiosyncratic productivity shocks are persistent. Every period, with probability 1 − ρ
a production site draws a new level of ε from a log-normal distribution. This new draw
is unconditional on εt−1 . With the counter-probability ρ the productivity level remains
unchanged:
(
)
εt−1 ,
with probability ρ
εt =
.
(2)
ln N (0, σε ), with probability 1 − ρ
The invariant distribution of ε is denoted f (ε).
We assume α < 1 as in Lucas (1978). The assumption of diminishing returns to scale
implies that the allocation of capital across production plants is non-trivial. There are gains
to allocating capital to high productivity sites but as α < 1, capital is also spread across
plants.
Following the realizations of plant-specific ε, capital can be reallocated across production
sites. Capital reallocation is costly. Our approach is to specify and estimate a minimalist
adjustment cost structure.5 Specifically, in order to learn about the plant-specific state (k, ε)
before reallocation and production take place, a fixed adjustment cost F must be paid. The
3

Aggregate shocks are added in section 3.2 for the study of cyclical reallocation.
The model does not distinguish between plants and firms and the terms are used interchangeably throughout. Labor and other inputs are not made explicit. One interpretation is that these inputs have no adjustment
costs and are optimally chosen each period, given the state.
5
The literature does not generally isolate capital reallocation costs. There are some important exceptions.
Ottonello (2018) focuses on the reallocation of capital, including a state of “capital unemployment”. In that
paper, the frictions are associated with search and matching. Li and Whited (2015) and Lanteri (2018) focus
on the endogeneity of irreversibility over the business cycle through the price of used capital.

adjustment cost F is independently and identically distributed across time and plants with
a CDF given by G(F ). As in Eisfeldt and Rampini (2006), these costs can be interpreted as
information frictions rather than physical adjustment frictions.6
This specification of the adjustment cost has three important features. First, combining costs of adjustment and information acquisition makes the analysis considerably more
tractable. In fact, many of our results are analytic. Second, the specification cleanly separates the costs and benefits of reallocation. As there is no state dependence in the adjustment
choice, the likelihood of adjustment is independent of the individual plant profitability. We
return to this feature below in discussing the generality of our findings. Third, many models
of costly capital adjustment have difficulty matching small investment rates.7 This is not
a problem in our formulation: after paying the information acquisition cost, capital adjustment might be minimal if the current level of capital is sufficiently close to the optimal level
of capital given ε.

2.2

Optimal allocations

In the presence of reallocation costs, the choice problem of a social planner is

In this optimization problem the state variable of the planner is the joint distribution over
plant level productivity and capital prior to reallocation, denoted by Γ(k, ε), explained below.
There are two controls in (3). The planner determines π, the fraction of plants that will
be adjusted, and chooses how to allocate capital among adjusting plants. The adjustment
status of a plant is given by j ∈ {a, n}, where a stands for ‘adjusting’, while n stands for
‘not adjusting’. This status is determined by whether or not a plant’s fixed cost of adjusting
6

Section 4 of Eisfeldt and Rampini (2006) provides a lengthy discussion and interpretation of these
adjustment costs.

For example, Cooper and Haltiwanger (2006) match the extremes of the investment rate distribution
but generate no small adjustments.

is paid. Let k̃j (k, ε) for j ∈ {a, n} denote the fraction of aggregate capital allocated to a
plant with adjustment status j that enters the period with capital k and productivity ε. The
capital of plants in the set of adjusters is optimally set by the planner to a level k̃a (k, ε).
The capital of plants in the group of non-adjusters remains unchanged, i.e. k̃n (k, ε) = k.
Here output is simply the sum of the production from adjusting and non-adjusting plants,
as in (4), while aggregate capital is the sum of capital in the two types of plants, as in (5). In
the resource constraint (6) the adjustment cost are linked to the fraction of adjusting plants
π through the CDF of adjustment costs.8 Specifically, given π, the planner selects plants
starting with the lowest adjustment costs until the desired fraction π of plants are adjusted.
Through this process, the maximal cost incurred is denoted F (π) and given implicitly by
π = G(F ). Once the maximal adjustment cost is determined, the total amount paid is the
integral over the distribution of adjustment costs up to F (π), as in the last term of (6).
As a benchmark, consider the planner’s problem in the absence of adjustment costs.
The objective is to maximize output (consumption) through an optimal allocation of capital.9 The cross-sectional distribution is no longer a state variable. The resulting first-order
condition is

(7)

for all ε. The optimal capital allocation equalizes marginal products of capital across plants.
Adjustment costs imply that the reallocation problem is dynamic. They create two distinct dimensions linked to the capital reallocation problem, an intensive and an extensive
margin. The extensive margin relates to the fraction of adjusting plants π, while the intensive
margin is controlled by the planner through the assignment function k̃a (k, ε). Both instruments influence the distribution of capital across plants but imply different costs. Choosing
a higher π enlarges the set of adjusting plants. This has the benefit of increasing output
today but increases the total adjustment costs. Choosing an allocation of capital k̃a (k, ε)
that reduces the dispersion in marginal products of capital also increases output today. Here,
costs arise due to future adjustment costs. Given that a fraction 1 − ρ of plants will receive
a new productivity draw next period, a fraction of plants will be not be at their optimal
k in the future. This entails larger future extensive margin adjustments and higher future
adjustment costs. For this reason, k̃a (k, ε) will differ from the capital allocation satisfying
(7).
We define reallocation of capital as the fraction of total capital that is moved between
adjusting plants within a period. As k̃a (k, ε) denotes the post-reallocation capital stock of

be r(k, ε) = |k̃a (k, ε) − k|. Aggregating over all adjusting plants, the aggregate reallocation
level is

The multiplication by 0.5 avoids double counting flows between adjusting plants.

2.3

Aggregate productivity

For this economy, there exists a fundamental link between productivity and the assignment
of capital to plants.10 This link lies at the heart of our analysis of reallocation and aggregate
productivity.
Aggregate output in (4) can be rewritten as
y = AK α [π(µa + φa ) + (1 − π)(µn + φn )] = ÃK α ,
where, for j = {a, n}, define µj ≡

R

(9)

i
h
εf (ε)dε · E k̃j (k, ε)α as the product of average produc-

tivity and average effective capital, while φj ≡ Cov(ε, k̃j (k, ε)α ) is the covariance between
the two terms.
The values µn and φn pin down output among non-adjusting plants and are determined
by the current state, the joint distribution of productivity and capital Γ. Output among
adjusting plants is controlled through the assignment function k̃a (k, ε). This assignment
of capital to adjusting plants implies values for the mean and covariance terms µa and φa .
Finally, the choice of a fraction of adjusting plants π determines the relative mass of adjusters
and non-adjusters.
Researchers interested in measuring TFP from the aggregate data will typically uncover
Ã, the Solow residual, rather than A. There are two factors which influence Ã. The first
one is A. The influence of A, aggregate TFP, on the Solow residual Ã is direct and has
been central to many studies of aggregate fluctuations. The second factor is the covariance
between plants’ productivity and their assigned capital. Some of the shocks we consider,
such as fluctuations in the distribution of idiosyncratic productivity and/or variations in the
distribution of adjustment costs, will impact the covariance term through the reallocation of
capital. This is reflected in the Solow residual.
10

This builds on Olley and Pakes (1996).

2.4

Joint distribution of capital and productivity

In the presence of reallocation frictions, the state of the economy includes the joint distribution of plant specific capital, k, and the idiosyncratic shock, ε, denoted as Γ(k, ε). This
distribution contains the information how much output is produced at non-adjusting plants.
Consequently, when making reallocation decisions the planner needs to forecast Γ0 . The
evolution of this distribution reflects the persistence in the idiosyncratic shocks as well as
the choices about the fraction of adjusting plants π and the assignment of capital among
adjusting plants k̃a (k, ε).
An advantage of our setup is that although the model is rich due to plant heterogeneity
and non-convex adjustment costs, it allows for an exact analytical representation of the
joint distribution and its evolution. Different from the literature following Krusell and
Smith (1998) we are not bound by computational limitations to a numerical approximation
of this joint distribution.
Instead of keeping track of the infinite-dimensional joint distribution Γ, we retain µn
and φn in the state vector of (3). Together with the choices π and k̃a (k, ε) this pins down
contemporaneous output in (9). To be clear, the higher-order moment, φn is part of the
state of economy because output depends on the assignment of capital to plants, based on
the realization of ε.
The law of motion for the distribution Γ can be written as

µ0n = (1 − π)µn + πµa

(10)

φ0n = ρ · ((1 − π)φn + πφa ) .

(11)

These are convex combinations of the moments from the adjusting and non-adjusting plants,
weighted respectively by π and 1 − π.11
As noted earlier, the Solow residual depends on µj and φj for j ∈ {a, n}. From (11), there
is a dynamic to these moments of the cross sectional distribution that will induce time series
variation in the Solow residual even in the absence of serially correlated aggregate shocks.
Thus these moments of the cross sectional distribution will be essential in the analysis that
follows.
Note that in the absence of aggregate shocks, this economy has a stationary joint distri11

These characterizations reflect the tradeoffs the planner is facing. Spreading capital more
evenly across plants increases µn but lowers the covariance with productivity φn . Increasing the fraction of adjusting plants π increases the steady-state covariance between sites’
productivity and capital from (13). But, this raises the amount of adjustment costs paid.

Quantitative analysis of capital reallocation

In this section, we estimate a quantitative version of the model developed in section 2. The
goal is to highlight the mechanisms that link variations in capital reallocation to aggregate
productivity. Because we want to emphasize capital reallocation, this part of the quantitative
analysis will focus use an environment that is constrained so that there is no capital accumulation. In Section 4 we extend the analysis to include traditional business cycle moments,
allowing for capital accumulation.
This section shows that a model with shocks to the cost of capital reallocation can match
the reallocation moments. Other competing models, in which fluctuations are driven either
by variations in TFP, uncertainty over the distribution of idiosyncratic shocks or by changes
in the dispersion of these shocks do not match the reallocation moments as well.

3.1

Parametrization

We begin by calibrating the steady state of the model described in Section 2.2. The parameters are chosen by targeting moments that characterize reallocation and the importance of
idiosyncratic shocks.
There are six parameters in the steady state of the model, summarized in Table 1. The
first two parameters describe the household’s discount factor and risk aversion and are set
outside the model. To determine the returns to scale parameter α, we estimated the curvature

data and model moments.

Table 2 compares data and model moments. While there is no one-to one mapping
between parameters and moments, the data moments were chosen to be informative about
the underlying parameters.

See Appendix A. Our estimate of α higher than some other estimates. In a study of firm level investment,
Cooper and Ejarque (2003) estimated the curvature of the firm revenue function at 0.69. At the plant level,
Cooper and Haltiwanger (2006) estimate the curvature at 0.592. Bloom et al. (2018) assume a 33% markup
in their parameterization. We provide a robustness analysis with respect to this and other parameters in
Appendix C.

10

The targeted moments were computed from Compustat for a sample of US firms. The
data is described in detail in Appendix A. The first two moments are the fraction of firms
that adjust capital and the fraction of total capital that is reallocated in a given period.
These moments are informative about the importance of the capital adjustment cost and
about the persistence of idiosyncratic productivity shocks. If reallocation is less costly,
capital in a larger fraction of plants will be reallocated, but in steady state a lower amount
of reallocation is required. A lower persistence of idiosyncratic productivity implies higher
reallocation rates and a higher extensive margin of capital reallocation. The third moment
is the standard deviation of firm-level TFPR, which is used to identify σε .13 This parameter
also has implications for the benefits of reallocation because if productivity is more dispersed
among plants, reallocation is more beneficial. The data moments are time series averages
and hence appropriate targets for the steady state of the model economy.
The parameter vector Θ is chosen to minimize the average percentage difference between
data and model moments. With this metric, the “fit” measures the variation in the data,
captured by the moments, that is not explained by the model.
Table 2 shows that the model fits the data moments very well. The model generates
the fact that a majority of plants adjusts capital each period, while only a small fraction
of total capital is reallocated. The estimated parameters imply that total adjustment costs
paid make up 3.2% of aggregate output. The implied autocorrelation of firm-level sales in
the model is equal to 0.906, while the same moment is 0.903 in the data.14

3.2

Cyclical reallocation

What are the implications of various aggregate shocks for the cyclical properties of capital
reallocation? In particular, what type of aggregate shocks are needed in order to generate
the properties of cyclical reallocation observed in the data?
To augment the model with aggregate fluctuations, the planner’s optimization problem,
as stated in (3)-(6) is modified in a couple of ways. First, the aggregate shock - denoted
as S - is introduced into the planner’s state vector in (3) along with the cross sectional
distribution Γ(k, ε). Second, the constraints in (4) and (6) can be affected by the shock.15
We consider four different sources of aggregate fluctuations, one at a time.
13

In the model, there is a single good so that TFPR and TFPQ are identical. In a more general setting
this distinction is important.
14
The microeconomic adjustment behavior is characterized by a rich distribution of plant-level changes
in capital. Some features of the reallocation model are a positive correlation between productivity and
plant-level changes in capital, a low serial correlation of changes in plant-level capital, and a large fraction
of ‘inactive’ plants.
15
The extension of the planner’s problem to include aggregate shocks is discussed in Appendix E.

11

For each type of aggregate shock, we re-estimate the adjustment cost parameter b and the
persistence of idiosyncratic shocks ρε , along with the parameters governing the evolution of
the respective aggregate shock. The parameters are chosen to match moments characterizing
cyclical reallocation. We do not re-estimate the standard deviation of idiosyncratic shocks σε
because the time-series mean of the standard deviation of firm-level TFPR is hardly affected
by the presence of the aggregate shocks.
The set of data moments includes the two moments targeted in the stationary model,
i) the fraction of plants with positive capital reallocation and ii) the average amount of
capital reallocation. To these we add iii) the correlation between GDP growth rates and
capital reallocation and iv) the correlation between GDP growth rates and the dispersion
in firm-level average products of capital (APK). Capital reallocation is pro-cyclical, while
the dispersion in APK is countercyclical. As emphasized in Eisfeldt and Rampini (2006)
and Kehrig (2011), these correlations are indicative of frictions in the reallocation process of
capital. The last moment we add to the analysis is v) the standard deviation of the amount of
capital reallocation. This moment is informative about the magnitude of potential distortions
to the reallocation process and goes beyond a simple correlation with GDP.16 Note that for
we are estimating four parameters using five moments.
3.2.1

Adjustment cost shocks

We begin by studying a model with aggregate fluctuations driven by variations in the distribution of the cost of capital reallocation. These shocks can drive pro-cyclical reallocation
in an equilibrium model. This model closely matches the reallocation moments.
We take these variations in adjustment frictions to be exogenous. In some settings, like
a model of imperfect information about capital quality, the friction itself might respond to
other shocks. To be clear, there are no direct measures of variations in the distribution of
reallocation costs. The evidence we present is necessarily indirect: making clear that the
economic mechanism stemming from this shock matches the data.
We assume that bt , the upper support of the adjustment cost distribution, follows an
AR(1) in logs:
log bt = log µb + ρb log bt−1 + νb,t , νb ∼ N (0, σb ).
The parameters µb , ρb , and σb are part of the estimated parameter vector. The estimated
values are shown in Table D.6 in Appendix D.
The data moments that capture the cyclical properties of capital reallocation are compared to the moments generated from simulating the model driven by fluctuations in adjust16

The model is able to match the reallocation moments, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Importantly, the model generates pro-cyclical reallocation, while the dispersion in
the firm-level productivity of capital is counter-cyclical, as in the data. At the same time,
the fraction of adjusters and the amount of capital reallocation are very close to their data
counterparts. The column labeled σ(R) quantifies the cyclical variation in the amount of
capital reallocation. Including this moment provides discipline so that the amount of capital
reallocation over the business cycle is in line with the data.17

Data

Note.– The moments are i) the fraction of firms with positive capital reallocation, ii) the average amount
of capital reallocation (as a fraction of total capital), iii) the correlation between output growth and growth
in capital reallocation, iv) the correlation between output growth and the standard deviation of the average
revenue product of capital (σAPK ), and v) the standard deviation of log reallocation. Model results from
simulation of T=20,000. The last column reports the average percentage difference between data and model
moments.

To understand the economic mechanism behind these results, consider a decrease in b.
This implies that reallocation becomes cheaper on the margin. The connection between
reallocation and output stemming from variations in b is shown in Figure 1.
The decrease in adjustment costs has direct and indirect effects. The direct effect is that
on impact, the lower adjustment costs lead to a larger fraction of adjusting plants, π. The
resulting reallocation of capital increases output and consumption. The total amount of
adjustment costs paid goes up at the same time. As a consequence of the increase in capital
reallocation, the dispersion of average products of capital falls.
An indirect effect of a decrease in b is a shift of reallocation from the intensive margin
(across plants), to the extensive margin (the number of adjusting plants, π). Expecting low
adjustment costs next period, the planner knows that choosing a given π will be less costly.
This affects the evolution of Γ, the endogenous joint distribution of productivity and capital,
governed by the laws of motion (10) and (11). In the steady state the covariance between
17

The model also generates a standard deviation of the fraction of adjusters π that is very close to the
data (not targeted).

plant-level capital and productivity among adjusting plants, φa , is higher than that of the
non-adjusters φn . The increase in π therefore implies an increase in φn over time, because a
larger fraction of plants adjusts capital.
At the same time, the planner continues to face the tradeoff between current reallocation and a potential future disconnect between productivity and capital among non-adjusting
plants. With the cheaper extensive margin of reallocation, the planner can reduce the spread
of capital among adjusting plants (intensive margin), while still improving the overall allocation of capital among all plants. This necessitates less future reallocation to reach a given
level of output and explains why the fraction of adjusting plants and total reallocation drop
after the initial spike.
Through the dynamic in µ and φ induced by the reduction in b, this shock can generate
potentially long-lasting effects on output and measured productivity. This is an important
14

part of our analysis, both because the choice problem of the planner depends on these higher
order moments and because the evolution of these moments are integral to the impulse
response functions. Output increases after the negative shock to b because of a better
allocation of capital across plants, which is mainly expressed through the increase in the
state variable φn . We return to this point in section 4.4 which highlights the significance of
these higher order moments for our results.
Beyond the mechanism, there are two additional important properties of the model.
First, notice the magnitude of the responses. There is a large change in the adjustment
rate and the amount of reallocation. While output and consumption respond as well, the
variation in the reallocation moments is considerably larger. Second, note the response of
the Solow residual. It remains high for many periods after the initial increase. These features
will be relevant later on in understanding how the adjustment cost shock model succeeds in
matching both reallocation and business cycle moments.
3.2.2

Alternative explanations

To what extent do other sources of aggregate fluctuations have the potential to explain the
cyclical properties of capital reallocation? In particular, we study three alternative versions of
our model, respectively driven by shocks to: (i) total factor productivity, (ii) the dispersion
of idiosyncratic shocks and (iii) uncertainty about future idiosyncratic productivity. All
three of these models are known for their apparent ability to match business cycle moments.
Importantly, the shocks also impact the costs and/or benefits of reallocation and therefore
have the potential to match the reallocation moments as well.
The main finding here is that none of these models matches the reallocation
moments as well as the model economy with a stochastic distribution of adjustment costs. Furthermore, as explored in section 4, these results continue to hold in an
environment with aggregate capital accumulation. These findings support a view of business
cycles in which movements in the Solow residual are endogenous and created by fluctuations
in reallocation.
For each of the three alternative models, we estimate the parameter vector Θ = (b, ρε , σS , ρS )
using SMM. The vector consists of the upper bound of the adjustment cost, b, the persistence of idiosyncratic shocks, ρε , as well as the standard deviation and persistence of the
respective aggregate shock, denoted σS and ρS . The estimated values are shown in Table
D.6 in Appendix D.
The quantitative fit of the models is presented in Table 3. Overall, the alternative
models are not able to fit the cyclical reallocation moments as well as the model economy
with adjustment cost shocks. The model with uncertainty shocks performs very poorly as
15

it fails to generate pro-cyclical reallocation. The model with aggregate TFP shocks does
produce pro-cyclical reallocation but the magnitudes do not match those in the data. The
remainder of this section discusses the results from the three alternative models in detail.
TFP shocks Consider first the traditional real business cycle model in which aggregate
fluctuations are driven only by shocks to aggregate total factor productivity (TFP). Assume
TFP follows an AR(1) in logs:
log At = ρA log At−1 + νA,t ,

νA ∼ N (0, σA ).

TFP shocks are well understood as being able to match a number of business cycle moments. In our setup, they also generate an endogenously pro-cyclical fraction of adjusting
plants. During expansions the gains to reallocation are increasing, while the costs of adjustment are independent of the current value of productivity. This generates pro-cyclical
reallocation and amplifies exogenous aggregate fluctuations.
Table 3 shows that the model is able to match the reallocation moments, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The fraction of adjusters and the amount of capital reallocation
are close to their data counterparts. The model generates pro-cyclical reallocation and a
counter-cyclical dispersion in the firm-level productivity of capital.
The mechanism that generates pro-cyclical reallocation rates and counter-cyclical dispersion in average products of capital is highlighted by the impulse response functions in
Figure 2. Besides a direct effect on production, the positive shock to TFP also increases the
benefits of reallocation. Due to the increase in capital reallocation and the persistent nature
of the TFP shock, more capital ends up in high-productivity plants, lowering the dispersion
of average products of capital. The panels in the third row show the evolution of the two
moments of the joint distribution of capital and productivity. Qualitatively, they respond
similarly to the adjustment cost shock studied above, but their magnitudes are significantly
smaller, by around an order of magnitude.
The model economy driven by TFP shocks cannot match the data as well as the adjustment cost model because of the small magnitude of the responses of the endogenous
distribution. This can be seen by studying the Solow residual in Figure 2, which responds
almost one-for-one with the aggregate TFP shock. The increase in capital reallocation and
the effect on the distribution summarized by µn and φn leads to an additional increase in the
Solow residual from (9), but this increase is very small in magnitude. The TFP shock affects
output directly and reallocation indirectly, whereas the adjustment costs shock has a direct
effect on capital reallocation while only generating indirect output effects. From Figure 2,

reallocation only increases by around 3% and output goes up by a similar magnitude. In
contrast, from Figure 1, in the case of shocks to b, the reallocation rate increases by over
15% while the output response is only about 0.6%. In addition, from Table 3, despite the
sizeable innovations to TFP, this model only generates around 80% of the total variation
in capital reallocation.18 Overall, for the model with shocks to adjustment costs, the relative magnitudes are much closer to the data. Consequently, the model with TFP shocks is
outperformed by that model.
Dispersion shocks Dispersion shocks are mean-preserving spreads to the innovations
of firm-specific productivity draws. These shocks are parameterized by λ, which governs
the standard deviation of the Normal distribution from which innovations to idiosyncratic

Similarly, the standard deviation of the fraction of adjusters (not targeted) is lower than in the data.

εt =

εt−1 ,
with probability
ln N (0, λt σε ), with probability

)
.

(15)

Changes in λ generate variations in f (ε), the distribution of idiosyncratic shocks, and thus
affect measured aggregate productivity directly. As can be seen in (7), in a frictionless
economy a mean-preserving spread in ε would incentivize the planner to carry out more
reallocation of capital between plants because capital can be employed in highly productive
sites as in Hartman (1972) and Abel (1983).
The stochastic process for λ is given by:
log λt = ρλ log λt−1 + νλ,t ,

νλ,t ∼ N (0, σλ ).

(16)

Note that the realization of idiosyncratic productivity occurs before capital reallocation takes
place. For this reason, these shocks are distinct from the ‘uncertainty shocks’ discussed below.
The state vector in the planner’s problem is supplemented to include λ. Variations in λ
alter aggregate output (4) by changing the distribution of idiosyncratic productivities.
Results from the model with dispersion shocks are shown in the row ‘Dispersion shocks’
in Table 3. Parameter estimates are shown in Table D.6.
The model with dispersion shocks is able to generate pro-cyclical capital reallocation and
a counter-cyclical dispersion of average products of capital. Further, the average amount
and the standard deviation of capital reallocation are in line with the data. However, the
model falls short in three respects.
First, the fraction of adjusters is lower than in the data. Second, capital reallocation is
only mildly pro-cyclical. Third, and perhaps most importantly, in order to generate procyclical reallocation, the dispersion shocks themselves must be pro-cyclical. As noted in
Kehrig (2011), Bloom et al. (2018), and others, measured dispersion in productivity appears
countercyclical.20
The impulse response functions in Figure 3 highlight the dynamics of the model with
dispersion shocks. Following a positive innovation to λ, plants that receive a new productivity
draw are sampling from a distribution with a higher variance of idiosyncratic shocks. This
19

An increase in the variance of the Normal distribution produces an increase in the mean of the corresponding log-normal distribution. We therefore adjust the mean µε after changes in the variance of ε to
achieve mean-preserving spreads.
20
To be clear, some of the evidence in Bloom et al. (2018), Kehrig (2011) and others measure the dispersion
in TFPR and not the dispersion of the underlying profitability shocks specified in our model. Eisfeldt and
Rampini (2006) focus on the cyclical properties of dispersion in Tobin’s Q, investment rates and total factor
productivity growth.

creates a temporary spike in reallocation in the period of the shock. As π falls, so does total
reallocation. Over time, as more and more plants draw idiosyncratic shocks from the changed
distribution, the benefits to reallocation increase. This leads to more capital reallocation.
The larger dispersion in plant-specific productivity, together with the increase in reallocation
leads to an increase in output.
The last panel shows the effects on the dispersion in average products of capital. The
APK dispersion is counter-cyclical because although the direct effect of the increase in λ
increases this dispersion, the increase in capital reallocation counteracts this force. Because
the gains to reallocation increase with the higher idiosyncratic productivity dispersion, more
plants adjust and more capital is reallocated each period. This better fit between capital
and productivity lowers the dispersion in the average product of capital.

19

Uncertainty shocks We define uncertainty shocks as variations in the persistence of idiosyncratic productivity. Lower values of ρε imply more uncertainty because a larger fraction
of firms draws a new productivity level for the next production cycle, thus potentially generating a larger mismatch with firm-level capital. This lowers the benefits to reallocation and
affects measured aggregate productivity.
In studies of ‘wait-and-see’ dynamics as in Bachmann and Bayer (2013) and Bloom et al.
(2018), capital takes one period time-to-build and cannot be reallocated within a period.
In those environments shocks to the future dispersion of firm-level productivity generate
heightened uncertainty regarding the mismatch between plant capital and productivity. This
can lead to a decrease in investment.
In our setup, the uncertainty channel can be captured through shocks to firms’ probability of receiving a new idiosyncratic productivity draw.21 We therefore label these shocks
‘uncertainty shocks’ as distinct from ‘dispersion shocks’.
In fact, Bloom et al. (2018) provide some evidence that is consistent with variations in
ρε rather than σε . From their Figure A1, plant rankings in the TFP distribution are less
correlated over time in recessions compared to expansions. This is a property of a shock to
ρε but would not arise if there was only a shock to the dispersion in the profitability shocks.
The stochastic process for ρε is given by
log ρt = log µρ + ρρ log ρt−1 + νρ,t ,

νρ,t ∼ N (0, σρ ).

(17)

To be clear, here ρt is the period t value of ρε . In this case, the state vector of the planner’s
problem is augmented to include ρt . The values of the estimated parameters µρ , ρρ , and σρ
are shown in Table D.6.22 Results from the model with uncertainty shocks are shown in the
row ‘Uncertainty shocks’ in Table 3.
The model is unable to generate pro-cyclical reallocation, in spite of successfully matching
other features of the data. As can be seen from the impulse response functions in Figure 4,
on impact the increase in uncertainty coming from the lower value of ρ reduces the expected
benefits to reallocation. This lowers the intensive and extensive margins of reallocation while
generating a (small) reduction in output. However, the dynamic effects of the uncertainty
shock work in the opposite direction. As the uncertainty shock persists, a marginal increase
in the fraction of reallocating plants generates a larger benefit than before the shock because
of the larger mismatch between capital and productivity. Reallocation increases, adjustment
21

Of course the adjustment costs are different, reflecting our emphasis on reallocation not capital accumulation. In our model, the planner is unable to delay the adjustment at a particular plant in order to learn
future productivity.

The column labeled ρ in Table D.6 refers to the estimated value of µρ .

costs increase, while output and the Solow residual fall. Because the costs of the extensive
margin of reallocation remain unchanged, more capital is being reallocated every period,
leading to counter-cyclical capital reallocation.

4

Adjustment Costs and Business cycles

The model with variations in the distribution of adjustment costs matches the reallocation
moments well, considerably better than competing models. This section goes further to
assess the cyclical properties created by the model driven by stochastic adjustment costs,
parameterized by b. This analysis is conducted in economies with capital accumulation to
complement the previous section that focused solely on reallocation.23 The model with
shocks to capital adjustment costs is able to jointly match salient features of
23

The model with capital accumulation and the various shocks is presented in section E of the appendix.

21

business cycles and reallocation, more closely than the competing models.

4.1

Capital accumulation

The set of business cycle moments traditionally includes investment. Thus capital accumulation must be added to the model along with reallocation.
The model decomposes the accumulation of capital at a particular plant into two components: (i) the aggregate investment rate and (ii) the reallocation of capital.24 We model
capital accumulation in a manner intended to distinguish costly reallocation from aggregate
capital accumulation. To do so, we assume that the capital at all plants, regardless of their
reallocation status, grows at the same rate. Further, there are no adjustment costs associated
with capital accumulation. This allows us to both highlight the role of reallocation frictions
and is consistent with most of the RBC literature that ignores adjustment costs for capital
accumulation.
Because capital is plant specific, it is necessary to specify transition equations at the plant
0
denote the gross investment rate so that K 0 = (1−δ+i)K
level. Specifically, let i = K −K(1−δ)
K
is the aggregate capital accumulation equation. The transition between capital this period
(after reallocation) and the initial plant-specific capital next period is given by
kj0 (k, ε, s) = (1 − δ + i)k̃j (k, ε, s),

(18)

for j ∈ {a, n}.

4.2

Moments and parameters

As in the models estimated to match the reallocation moments summarized in Table 3, there
are four parameters estimated for each of the models. The values of the remaining parameters
are those shown in Table 1. To this we add an annual depreciation rate of δ = 0.10.
The full set of moments, given in Table 4, includes business cycle moments along with
those described earlier that summarize patterns of reallocation. Moments 6-13 in Table 4
include the serial correlation of output, its standard deviation, the correlation of output and
consumption, the correlation of consumption and investment, the relative standard deviations of consumption and output, and finally the serial correlation and the standard deviation
of the Solow residual. These moments pertaining to the Solow residual are of particular interest for those economies not driven by exogenous variations in TFP. From (9), variations
in capital allocation, driven by reallocation, impact measured aggregate productivity. The
24

If there were no adjustment costs, this decomposition would be innocuous.

22

interesting question is quantitative: i.e. can the economies driven by variations in dispersion,
uncertainty and the costs of reallocation generate a Solow residual that mimics the data? If
so, as established below, the other standard business cycle moments will follow.

4.3

Results

The parameters were chosen to minimize the average percentage distance between the 13
simulated and data moments. The parameter estimates are given in Table D.7 for the four
types of aggregate shocks.
From Table 4, the model with adjustment cost shocks alone best fits the moments. The
model economy nearly matches the standard deviations of output and the Solow residual and
at the same time matches the empirical reallocation rate. It captures 87.5% of the variation in
the moments. It does so with changes in productivity induced by capital reallocation rather
than through a direct TFP shock. The Solow residual from this model is more serially
correlated and slightly less volatile than in the data. Consumption and investment are both
pro-cyclical, with consumption relatively more volatile and investment relatively less volatile
than in the data. If anything, the model generates “too much” aggregate volatility in order
to match the level of capital reallocation in the data.
Not surprisingly the TFP shock model is also able to capture many features of aggregate
fluctuations but, as noted earlier, it fails to match the reallocation moments as closely as
the model with adjustment cost shocks. Matching the reallocation moments requires TFP
shocks that are large compared to traditional estimates of aggregate productivity. This is
the issue of magnitude noted earlier and is the source of the tension between matching these
two different types of moments in the TFP shock case.
The model with dispersion shocks, essentially by generating cyclical benefits to reallocation, is able to jointly capture the reallocation and business cycle moments. But it does so
only if dispersion in productivity is pro-cyclical.
The model with uncertainty shocks generates relative volatilities in consumption and
investment much closer to the data compared to the model with adjustment cost shocks.25
But as noted earlier, reallocation is countercyclical.
As for the parameters reported in Table D.7, the upper support of the adjustment cost
distribution is sensitive to the source of the business cycle. The serial correlation in the
dispersion of the idiosyncratic shocks, an important determinant of the level of reallocation,
is essentially constant across models. The aggregate shocks are all highly serial correlated
25

This contrasts with the results in Bloom et al. (2018) where, as discussed in their section 5.5.2, an
additional TFP shock is needed to match consumption moments.

23

inducing the highly correlated Solow residual. The dispersion of the shock is very low in the
uncertainty model, owed to the model’s bad fit of the data moments.

Impulse response functions computed from the best-fitting model, the one driven by
shocks to the adjustment cost distribution, are shown in Figure 5. The figure highlights
the response of output and its components to variations in the Solow residual caused by
reductions in the adjustment costs. When the shock occurs, capital in a larger fraction of
plants is reallocated, i.e. π increases and more capital is allocated towards more productive
plants. This causes an increase in the Solow residual, reflected in the response of the joint
distribution Γ, captured by µn and φn , shown in the last panel.

While the response of consumption is hump-shaped due to the consumption-smoothing
motive, investment spikes following the reduction in b. The high level of investment reflects
the increased return to capital accumulation when reallocation is cheaper. Because of the
endogenous increase in the Solow residual Ã, giving up one unit of consumption today
delivers more units of output in the future because of the improved allocation of capital.
The persistence of the exogenous shock b and the slow-moving joint distribution Γ lead to a
persistent response of the Solow residual.
Aggregate output is the product of the Solow residual Ã and K α . The dynamics of the
Solow residual drive the response of output, which gains additional persistence through the
slow increase in the aggregate capital stock. Essentially, once the variation in b impacts
the Solow residual, the economic mechanism that generates fluctuations in the standard real
business cycle model, take over in this economy as well.

Importance of the cross-sectional distribution

Studies following the methodology of Krusell and Smith (1998) routinely find that only first
moments are needed to summarize cross sectional distributions. Relatedly, Thomas (2002)
and the literature that followed emphasized the near equivalence between the aggregate
moments of a model with lumpy investment and the aggregate implications of a real business cycle model at the plant-level. In our economy, the two state variables µn and φn capture
the endogenous cross-sectional distribution between plant-level capital and profitability. A
higher-order moment, the covariance φn , is part of the state space of the problem. This
covariance evolves in response to shocks, breaking the near equivalence result. Following aggregate shocks, φn changes because capital is redistributed between plants. This constitutes
an endogenous propagation mechanism of the model from reallocation to aggregate output.
To illustrate this point, consider again the output response of the economy following a
negative shock to adjustment costs. This was shown in Panel 3 of Figure 5 and is reproduced
as the red area in the left panel of Figure 6 below, labeled Y . To show the role of the crosssectional moments in shaping output dynamics, we recompute the aggregate output series
holding the distribution Γ fixed. This implies that the dynamics of this alternative series
are shaped solely by aggregate capital and the reallocation choices of the planner. The
state variables µn and φn are assumed to stay constant. The result is the series labeled YΓ̄ ,
shown as the blue area in the left panel of Figure 6. On impact, the two time series react
identically. The reason is that µn and φn are state variables and only respond one period
after the shock. In the periods following the shock, ignoring the evolution of Γ leads to
significant differences between the two series. This is because the planner’s choices of π,

as well as µa and φa significantly shape the cross-sectional distribution between capital and
productivity, as is made clear by the laws of motion in (10) and (11). From the equation for
aggregate output in (9) it can be seen that ignoring these movements in the distribution can
lead to the omission of important aggregate output dynamics.
The right panel of Figure 6 decomposes the difference between the series Y and YΓ̄ into
its components. The difference between Y and YΓ̄ is shown as the yellow area. It is zero
when the aggregate shock occurs, then increases and returns back to zero as the aggregate
state reverts back to its unconditional mean. The blue and green areas in the right panel
of Figure 6 correspond to the part that is respectively explained by µn and φn . The figure
shows that the higher-order moment φn is key for tracking the movement of the cross-sectional
distribution Γ. In the periods following the aggregate shock, the changes in φn constitute
the vast majority of the difference between the series.

Conclusion

The goal of this paper was to understand the source and implications of pro-cyclical reallocation. A model with variations in the costs of capital adjustment fits both
reallocation and business cycles moments better than competing models.
The aggregate implications of reallocation were studied through the lens of a planner’s
optimization problem facing frictions in capital reallocation. The heterogeneity in plant-level
27

productivity provides the basis for reallocation. The frictions in adjustment prevent the full
realization of these gains. The economy was subject to a variety of shocks. The outcome was
evaluated relative to moments summarizing capital reallocation and aggregate fluctuations.
There are two key findings in this paper. The first concerns the source of fluctuations.
In terms of matching the reallocation and business cycle moments, the economy driven by
variations in the distribution of adjustment costs fits the moments best. When shocks to
the distribution of adjustment costs are present, then reallocation is pro-cyclical. Further,
the standard deviation of the cross sectional distribution of average capital productivity is
countercyclical.
This model can also reproduce many features of the aggregate economy. The capital
reallocation induces pro-cyclical movements in the Solow residual, as if the economy was
driven by TFP shocks. We found that the model with adjustment cost shocks alone explains
about 87.5% of the variation captured by the moments.
Put differently, the variations in the distribution of adjustment, through its effect of capital reallocation, act a device to generate endogenous movements in the Solow residual. From
that perspective, our model is more of a complement to the RBC model than a substitute.
The second main finding is that the covariance of capital and productivity shocks at the
plant-level matters for characterizing the planner’s solution in the presence of adjustment
cost shocks. This is important since it is indicative of state dependent gains to reallocation
which interact with variations in the costs of adjustment. Our economy is an example where
moments other than means are needed in the planner’s problem.
Given these findings, it is useful to return to some of the main assumptions of the model
concerning the specification of adjustment costs for reallocation and accumulation. First,
consider allowing the planner to know the realized value of (k, ε) prior to making a decision
on reallocation. In that case some of the small capital adjustments that arise in our model
would not be undertaken. But, more to the point, it is not apparent that this alternative
form of adjustment costs would remedy the inability of the model driven by TFP shocks to
match the facts. Recall that the problem with that model was one of magnitude: reallocation
rates are too low relative to output variations in the simulated data compared to the actual
data. There is no clear argument that allowing more state dependence would resolve this
issue nor fix the inconsistencies between actual and simulated moments of the other models.
Second, suppose that there were costs of capital accumulation in addition to adjustment.
For example, one could add quadratic adjustment costs to the planner’s problem. In that
case, the response of capital accumulation would be muted, to all types of shocks. But,
as argued above, there is no reason to think that this additional friction would solve the
magnitude problem of the TFP driven model.
28

As in the contribution of Bloom et al. (2018), this paper provides another step away from
the reliance on exogenous productivity shocks as a source of business cycles. It replaces this
with endogenous movements in the Solow residual created by capital reallocation. What
remains open for further analysis is the nature of exogenous variations in the costs of reallocation that drive these fluctuations. Our evidence is indirect: pointing to the ability of the
model economy to match the facts without a direct measure of the shocks. In this sense, our
analysis has the same weakness as the RBC and uncertainty driven models.

Data

All of the data targets used in this paper were computed from Compustat. We use the
annual Compustat database between 1971 (the first year our measure of capital reallocation
is available) and 2013. We delete non-US firms and firms that only appear during a single
year. Further, we drop observations with less than $100’000 in sales, total assets, total
capital, and those with missing total assets or depreciation. We remove firms in the financial
industry and utilities (SIC codes 4900-4999 and 6000-6999). Firm-level capital is computed
using a perpetual inventory method.
For the estimation of revenue-based total factor productivity (TFPR), we follow the
methodology of Olley and Pakes (1996), implemented e.g. by İmrohoroğlu and Tüzel (2014).
The parameter α governing the curvature of the revenue function in the model is computed
as α = 1−α̂β̂ , where α̂ and β̂ denote the estimated elasticities of capital and labor. These
elasticities were estimated controlling for year and 3-digit industry fixed effects. We find
α̂ = .196 and β̂ = .756, implying α = 0.80.
To compute data moments that pertain to capital reallocation we follow Eisfeldt and
Rampini (2006). Capital reallocation R is the sum of sales of property, plant and equipment,
and acquisitions. The average fraction of capital being reallocated, R/K, is the average of
R divided by total property, plant, and equipment. The average product of capital (APK)
is defined as Y /K, sales divided by capital. We compute its dispersion as the the time-series
median of the annual value-added weighted standard deviations. Investment is the sum of
capital expenditures and acquisitions.
As a robustness check, we have computed all target moments using aggregate sales of all
firms in our sample instead of GDP. The results are qualitatively robust to this change: The
correlation of aggregate sales with capital reallocation is 0.33 and the correlation with the
dispersion in APK is -0.17 in that case.
Our results are robust to the weighting procedure used. Weighing observations with total
sales, instead of value-added, leaves our results almost identical to those described in the
main text.

from the first order condition of (B.1), which implies αAεk̃a (ε)α−1 = η for all ε, where η

is the multiplier on (B.2). This implies k̃a (ε) = αAε
. Using the resource constraint

(B.2), η = AαK α−1 ε ε 1−α f (ε)dε
. Putting these two conditions together yields the
expression for optimal capital (7).
Stationary distribution The stationary value of φ in (13) and the law of motion for
the distribution Γ in (11) is computed using the following steps. φ0 = Cov(ε0 , k̃ α ) =
Cov(ρε, k̃ α ) = ρφ because the covariance between k̃ and productivity among the randomly
drawn fraction 1 − ρ is zero.
Computational solution of the model To solve the model computationally, we search
for an optimal capital vector at each point of the state space, using N = 21 grid points for
the idiosyncratic productivity levels. The choice of the capital vector then implies values of
µa and φa , which together with the elements µn and φn of the current state, determine the
future endogenous state variables that make up the joint distribution. To find the optimal
capital vector we use the optimal frictionless allocation from (7) as an upper bound.

Sensitivity Analysis

The SMM estimation of the baseline parameters resulted in a error of 0.006% average percentage distance between the model moments and data moments. Changing α to 0.7 (from
α = 0.8 in the main text) an almost equally good fit (0.007%) was achieved with resulting
parameter estimates b = .2031, ρε = 0.80, and σε = 0.3127. The benchmark values are
reported in Table 1.
