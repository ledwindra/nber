    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper presents a model of dynamically consistent monetary policy that explains changes in inflation over time. In the model -- as in the postwar United States -- adverse supply shocks trigger persistent increases in inflation, and disinflation occurs when a tough policymaker creates a recession. The paper also proposes an approach to selecting a unique, plausible equilibrium in infinite-horizon models of monetary policy.\n\n",
