    "abstract": "\n\nChina\u2019s industrial policies (\u201cFive-Year Plans\u201d) displace U.S. production/employment and heighten plant closures in the same industries as those targeted by the policies in China. The impact was not anticipated by the stock market, but U.S. companies in the \"treated industries\" suffer a valuation loss afterwards. Firms shift production to upstream or downstream industries benefiting from the boost, or offshore to government-endorsed industries in China. Such within-firm adjustments offset the direct impact. U.S. firms are better able to withstand foreign government interventions provided that they enjoy flexibility, including preexisting business toeholds in the \"beneficiary\" industries, financial access, and labor fluidity.\n\n",
