Parental Incentives and Early Childhood Achievement: A Field Experiment in Chicago Heights

NBER Working Paper No. 21477

JEL No. I20,J01
ABSTRACT
This article describes a randomized field experiment in which parents were provided financial incentives
to engage in behaviors designed to increase early childhood cognitive and executive function skills
through a parent academy. Parents were rewarded for attendance at early childhood sessions, completing
homework assignments with their children, and for their child’s demonstration of mastery on interim
assessments. This intervention had large and statistically significant positive impacts on both cognitive
and non-cognitive test scores of Hispanics and Whites, but no impact on Blacks. These differential
outcomes across races are not attributable to differences in observable characteristics (e.g. family size,
mother’s age, mother’s education) or to the intensity of engagement with the program. Children with
above median (pre-treatment) non cognitive scores accrue the most benefits from treatment.

There is no program or policy that can substitute for a mother or father who will attend those parent-teacher
conferences or help with the homework or turn off the TV, put away the video games, read to their child.
Responsibility for our children’s education must begin at home.
--Barack Obama in an address to a Joint Session of Congress 2009

Parental inputs matter. Children quasi-randomly assigned via adoption to highly
educated parents and small families are twice as likely to graduate from a college ranked by
U.S. News & World Report, have an additional .75 years of schooling, and are 16 percent
more likely to complete four years of college (Sacerdote 2007). Black et al (2005)
demonstrate that birth order has an important impact on educational attainment, adult
earnings, employment, and teenage childbearing. Many believe that the importance of
parental inputs – along with the racial and income differences that exists in such inputs – is
an important cause of intergenerational inequality (Becker and Tomes 1979). 1
In an effort to increase the quantity and quality of early life experiences and decrease
the gaps between race and income groups in these formative years, early education programs
have become laboratories of reform. 2 One potentially cost-effective – and scalable – strategy,
not yet tested in America, is providing short-term financial incentives for parents to increase
their involvement with their children or exhibit certain behaviors believed to be important
for the production of human capital. Theoretically, providing such incentives could have one
of three possible effects. First, if low-income parents lack sufficient motivation, heavily
discount the future, or lack accurate information on either the educational production
function or the returns to parental investment, providing incentives for parental involvement
will yield increases in parental participation and potentially child achievement. Second, if
parents lack structural resources to convert effort to output, or the production function of
child achievement has important complementarities out of their control (e.g. adequate food
There are large racial and income differences in parental inputs. Black children are reared in environments
with 58% less books than whites and are less likely to engage in activities such as going to museums (Fryer and
Levitt 2004). From birth to kindergarten entry, black children spend 1,300 less hours in conversations with
adults than white children (Phillips 2011). Hart and Risley (1995) argue that children from low-income families
hear 30 million fewer words than children from high-income families.
2 There is a large established literature on the efficacy of early childhood interventions. The evidence on the
scalability of these strategies -- due to cost, access, and replicability of results – is less clear. See Almond and
Currie (2010) for an extensive review of the literature. York and Loeb (2014) provide new evidence on the
positive effects of a text messaging program for preschoolers designed to help them facilitate literacy
development.

supply, safe neighborhoods, or health care), then incentives will have little impact. Third,
some argue that financial rewards (or any type of external reward or incentive) crowd out
intrinsic motivation and lead to negative outcomes in the long run. Which one of the above
effects – investment incentives, structural inequalities, or intrinsic motivation – will dominate
is unknown. The experimental estimates obtained in this study will combine elements from
these and other potential channels.
In the 2011-2012 school year, we conducted a parental incentive experiment in
Chicago Heights – a prototypical low performing urban school district – by starting a parent
academy that distributed nearly $1 million to 257 families (figures include treatment and
control). 3 There were two treatment groups, which differed only in when families were
rewarded, and a control group. Parents in the two treatment groups were paid for attendance
at Parent Academy sessions, proof of homework completion, and the performance of their
children on benchmark assessments. The only difference between the two treatment groups
is that parents in one group were paid in cash or via direct deposits (hereafter the “cash”
condition) and parents in the second group received the majority of their incentive payments
via deposits into a trust account which can only be accessed if and when the child enrolls in
college (the “college” incentive condition). Eleven project managers and staff worked
together to ensure that parents understood the particulars of the treatment; that the parent
academy program was implemented with high fidelity; and that payments were distributed
on-time and accurately.
Across the entire sample, the impact on cognitive test scores of being offered a
chance to participate in our parental incentive is 0.119σ (with a standard error of 0.094). 4
These estimates are non-trivial, but smaller in magnitude than some classroom based
interventions. For instance, the impact of Head Start on test scores is approximately 0.145σ.
The impact of the Perry Preschool intervention on achievement at 14 years old is 0.203σ.
Given the imprecision of the estimates, however, our results are statistically indistinguishable

In 2010, we conducted a pilot experiment designed to work out operational and logistical challenges and to
write a year-long curriculum. Results from the pilot are provided in Appendix Tables 10-14.
4 An important limitation of our field experiment is that it was constructed to detect treatment effects of 0.2
standard deviations or more with eighty percent power. Thus, we are underpowered to estimate effect sizes
below this cutoff, many of which could have a positive return on investment. This level of power seemed
reasonable ex ante given the relatively large effect sizes reported in the early childhood literature (see, e.g.,
Zaslow et al. 2010).

both from these programs and from zero. The impact of the “college” and “cash” incentive
schemes are nearly identical.
The impact of being offered a chance to participate in our parental incentive scheme
on non-cognitive skills is large and statistically significant (0.203σ (0.083)). These results are
consistent with Kautz et al. (2014), who argue that parental investment is an important
contributor to non-cognitive development. Again, the “cash” and “college” schemes yield
identical results.
We complement our main statistical analysis by estimating heterogeneous treatment
effects across a variety of pre-determined subsamples that we blocked on experimentally.
Two stark patterns appear in the data. The first pattern is along racial lines: Hispanics (48
percent of our sample) and Whites (8 percent of the sample) demonstrate large and
significant increases in both cognitive and non-cognitive domains. For instance, the impact
of our parent academy for Hispanic children is 0.367σ (0.133) on our cognitive score and
0.428σ (0.122) on our non-cognitive score. Among the small sample of Whites, the impacts
are 0.932σ (0.353) on cognitive and 0.821σ (0.181) on non-cognitive. The identical estimates
for Blacks are actually negative but statistically insignificant on both cognitive and noncognitive dimensions: -0.234σ (0.134) and -0.059σ (0.129), respectively. Importantly, pvalues on the differences across races are statistically significant at conventional levels. 5 We
explore a range of possible hypotheses regarding the source of the racial differences (extent
of engagement with the program, demographics, English proficiency, pre-treatment scores),
but none provide a convincing explanation of the complete effect.
The second pattern of heterogeneity in treatment that we observe in the data relates
to pre-treatment test scores. Students who enter our program below the median on noncognitive skills see no benefits from our intervention in either the cognitive or non-cognitive
domain. In stark contrast, students who enter our parent academy above the median in noncognitive skills experience treatment effects of roughly 0.3 standard deviations on both
This pattern of racial heterogeneity is a recurring theme in the literature on early childhood achievement.
Gentzkow and Shapiro (2008) demonstrate that an additional year of preschool television has marginally
significant positive effects on reading and general knowledge scores. However, these effects are the largest for
children from households where the primary language is not English and for non-white children. Currie and
Thomas (1999) report that Head Start pre-school closes at least one-fourth of the gap in test scores between
Latino children and non-Hispanic white children, and two-thirds of the gap in the probability of grade
repetition. The Parents as Teachers program, which is a parent education program that is designed to
strengthen parent’s knowledge of child development and help prepare their children for school, has larger
effects on Latino families than on non-Latino families (Wagner and Clayton 1999).

cognitive and non-cognitive dimensions. If we segment children by both cognitive and noncognitive pre-treatment scores, the greatest gains are made on both the cognitive and noncognitive dimension by students who start the program above the median on non-cognitive
skills and below the median on cognitive skills. A similar complementary between cognitive
and non-cognitive skills has been observed in observational studies (Weinberger 2014).
The remainder of our paper is structured as follows. Section II gives a brief review of
the experimental literature on parental incentives. Section III provides some details of our
experiment and its implementation. Section IV details the data, research design, and
estimating equations used in our analysis. Section V presents estimates of the impact of
parental incentives on a child’s cognitive and non-cognitive skills. Section VI provides some
discussion and speculation about potential theories that might explain the differences
between racial groups in estimated treatment effects. There are two online appendices.
Appendix A is an implementation supplement that provides details on the timing of our
experimental roll-out and critical milestones reached. Appendix B is a data appendix that
provides details on how we construct our covariates and our samples from the data collected
for the purposes of this study.
II. A Brief Literature Review on Parental Incentives for Achievement
This paper lies at the intersection of several literatures: (1) early childhood
interventions such as Perry Pre-School or Head Start; (2) parental education interventions
such as Parents as Teachers; and (3) a small literature on parental incentives. An extensive
review of the first of these literatures is provided by Almond and Currie (2010). Likewise,
Nye et al. (2006) provide a systematic review of the second literature. Interested readers are
directed to those studies for excellent work in these two areas. We are not aware of a
parallel survey on the emerging literature on parental incentives to increase educational
achievement (e.g. Fryer 2011, Middleton et al. 2005, Skoufias 2005, Attanasio et al. 2005,
Chaudhury and Parajuli 2006 and Kremer, Miguel and Thornton 2009).
The most well-known and well analyzed incentive program for parents is
PROGRESA, which was an experiment conducted in Mexico in 1998 that provided cash
incentives linked to health, nutrition, and education. The largest component of PROGRESA
was linked to school attendance and enrollment. The program provided cash payments to
mothers in targeted households to keep their children in school (Skoufias 2005). As a part of
4

the program, households could receive up to $62.50 per month if children attended school
regularly. The average amount of incentives received by treatment households in the first
two years of treatment was $34.80, which was 21% of an average household’s income.
Besides school attendance, PROGRESA also emphasized actual student achievement by
making a child ineligible for the program if she failed a grade more than once (Skoufias 2005,
Slavin et al. 2009).
Schultz (2000) reports that PROGRESA had a positive impact on school enrollment
for both boys and girls in primary and secondary school. For primary school children,
PROGRESA increased school enrollment for boys by 1.1 percentage points and 1.5
percentage points for girls from a baseline level of approximately 90 percent. For secondary
school students, enrollment increased by 7.2 to 9.3 percentage points for boys and 3.5 to 5.8
percentage points for girls, from a baseline level of approximately 70%. The author also
reports that PROGRESA had an accumulated effect of 0.66 years additional schooling for a
student from the average poor household. Taking the baseline level of schooling at face
value, PROGRESA’s 0.66 years accumulated effect translates into a 10% increase in
schooling attainment. 6
Opportunity NYC – modeled after PROGRESA – was an experimental conditional
cash transfer program that was conducted in New York City. The program had three
components: the Family Rewards component that gave incentives to parents to fulfill
responsibilities towards their children; the Work Rewards component that gave incentives
for families to work; and the Spark component that gave student incentives to increase
achievement scores in classes. The program began in August 2007 and ended in August 2010
(Silva 2008).
Riccio et al. (2013) analyze data from the Family Rewards component of the program
during the first two years of treatment. Their analysis is based on 4,800 families with 11,000
children out of which half were assigned to treatment and the other half to control.
Opportunity NYC spent $8,700 per family in treatment over three years. The program had
an insignificant impact on school outcomes (Riccio et al. 2013). The children’s award

Behrman, Sengupta, and Todd (2001) also analyze the data and report that PROGRESA children entered
school at an earlier age, had less grade repetition, and better grade progression. Treatment children also had
lower dropout rates and once dropped out, they had a higher chance of re-entry into high school.

experiment, analyzed in Fryer (2011), showed no impact on student achievement or
attainment.
Fryer and Holden (2012) conduct a field experiment in fifty Houston public schools
designed to understand the impact of aligning teacher, student, and parent incentives on a
common goal: raising math achievement. On outcomes for which they provided direct
incentives, there were very large and statistically significant treatment effects. Students in
treatment schools mastered more than one standard deviation more math objectives, parents
attended twice as many parent-teacher meetings, and student achievement increased. Aligned
incentives have a large impact on the inputs for which incentives were provided and a
corresponding positive impact on math achievement and negative impact on reading
achievement. Moreover, the achievement effects persist two years after removing the
incentives.
III. Program Details and Research Design
The field experiment was conducted in Chicago Heights, IL. Chicago Heights lies 10
square miles south of Chicago. According to the 2010 Census, the population is 30, 276;
nearly 80% of which is either black or Hispanic. Per capita income is $17,546 and the
median home value is $125,400. 90% of students in the Chicago Heights School District
receive free or reduced price lunch.
Table 1 provides a birds-eye view of our experiment and its implementation. Online
Appendix A gives further program and implementation details. The experiment followed
standard implementation protocols. First, we built a partnership with the superintendent of
the Chicago Heights School District, who supported our recruiting efforts and helped to
secure space for the experiment.
Second, we ran a large local marketing campaign to inform and enroll parents in the
experiment. This included sending five direct mailings to the roughly 2,000 target families,
as well as a single mailing to families with older children enrolled in the local school district,
District 170, who might help refer target families (approximately 7,500), and to the
community at large (approximately 12,000). We collaborated with superintendents from
neighboring districts to perform robo-calls to families in their communities providing
information about the experiment. We distributed information about the program through

6

district leadership staff, newspapers, and phone calls. We also held three information
sessions, six registration events, and more than ten community events.
Third, we selected the curriculum to be used in our treatment. We searched for
existing curricula that would teach parents to help their children with both cognitive skills
(such as spelling and counting) as well as non-cognitive skills (such as memory and selfcontrol). It is unusual for a curriculum to address both of these areas. Moreover, there are
very few parent curricula that have been evaluated by randomized control trials. None of the
reviewed curricula fulfilled the requirements of the project, so we had to create a curriculum.
We decided to take two effective pre-school curricula, one that emphasizes cognitive skills
(Literacy Express) and another that focuses on non-cognitive skills (Tools of the Mind), and
use them as a guide to develop the Parent Academy curriculum. Appendix A describes our
selection process. All sessions were taught by the same teacher (in English). One session of
each lesson had a Spanish translator present for parents who had difficulty with English.
Fourth, we identified the appropriate assessments to be used in the experiment. To
do so, we evaluated norm-referenced assessment batteries currently being used in the social
sciences, conducted a series of interviews with experts in early childhood and developmental
psychology, and hosted a two-day conference at the University of Chicago where leading
experts convened to discuss assessment strategies. From this process, we decided to
administer two assessments designed to measure cognitive ability and two assessments to
measure non-cognitive skills.
The cognitive assessments consist of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT)
and the Woodcock Johnson III Test of Achievement (WJ-III). PPVT is a leading measure of
receptive vocabulary for standard English (resp. Spanish) and a screening test of verbal
ability. It is a norm-referenced standardized assessment that can be used with subjects aged
2-90 years old (Dunn et al. 1965). The WJ-III is a set of tests for measuring general
intellectual ability, specific cognitive abilities, oral language, and academic achievement. It is a
norm-referenced standardized assessment that can be used with subjects aged 2-80 years old
(Woodcock, McGrew, and Mather 2001).
The non-cognitive assessments consist of the Blair and Willoughby Measures of
Executive Function and the Preschool Self-Regulation Assessment. The Blair and
Willoughby Measures of Executive Function includes a battery of executive function tasks
including “Operation Span” – which measures the construct of working memory, asking
7

children to identify and remember pictures of animals – and “Spatial Conflict II: Arrows” –
which measures the construct of inhibitory control, asking children to match 37 arrow cards
in sequence (Willoughby, Wirth and Blair 2012). The Preschool Self-Regulation Assessment
is designed to assess self-regulation in emotional, attentional, and behavioral domains.
This battery of assessments was given at the beginning of the program to obtain an
accurate profile of each student, and was then given at the end of each semester. Each
assessment was administered (blind to treatment) by a team of administrators who all held
Bachelor’s degrees and were trained in assessment implementation. It was graded by pen and
paper and then coded electronically.
Research Design
We use a simple, single draw, block randomization procedure to partition the set of
interested families into treatment and control. A total of 260 subjects, including siblings,
participated in the lottery and were randomly assigned to one of our two treatments or to the
control group. 7 74 families were selected to be in treatment one (“cash”), 84 to be in
treatment two (“college”), and the remaining 99 served as the control group.
For those who were randomized into one of our two treatment groups, 90 minute
Parent Academy sessions were held every two weeks over a nine month period, for a total of
eighteen sessions. Both parents were encouraged to attend and onsite child care services
were provided free of charge to encourage attendance.
Parent Academy families had the opportunity to earn up to $7,000 a year and could
participate until their children entered kindergarten. Participants were given $100 per session
for attendance if they arrived on time or less than 5 minutes after the session began. They
received $50 for being “tardy” or arriving between 5 and 30 minutes late. No payment was
given if they arrived more than 30 minutes late or not at all. Rewards for attendance were
paid in cash or via direct deposit in both of our treatment groups.
Families with children in the pilot program who returned for 2011-2012 were guaranteed a spot; these families
were not part of the randomization and not analyzed in this paper. Families with multiple siblings in the
program were included in the program, but are excluded from our analysis because if one sibling was
randomized into treatment, both siblings were assigned to treatment. This means that siblings had a greater
chance of getting access to our program than singletons, distorting the randomization. Excluding multiple
siblings is common practice in lottery-based education evaluations (Angrist et al 2010 and Dobbie and Fryer
2011). There were three such families in our study; all six of these children ended up in the “college” treatment
arm. Therefore, the final experimental sample consisted of 254 individuals – 74 “cash”, 81”college” and 99
“control”.

Each participant in the Parent Academy was also given a variety of assignments
designed to reinforce the learning objectives of the sessions. Some of these assignments
asked the parents to submit videos of themselves working with their children while others
simply asked them to hand in their assignments in the upcoming session. For homework
incentives, parents received $100, $60, $30, or $0 depending upon whether they received an
A, B, C, or I (incomplete) grade on their homework assignment. These payments were
made via cash/direct deposit in our “Cash” treatment. In our “College” treatment, the
homework incentives were deposited into account that cannot be accessed until parents
provide proof that the child is enrolled in a full-time postsecondary institution. 8
There were 18 sessions and 17 homework assignments. Thus, a parent with perfect
attendance and “A” quality homework for every assignment earned $3,500. The remainder
of the incentive payment was based on each child’s assessments. Children were given a
major assessment at the end of each semester and multiple shorter assessments to test
whether homework assignments were being completed, and whether they were effective.
Parents could earn up to $1800 a year for interim evaluations based on the child’s
performance. Finally, parents could earn up to $1600 in total for the two major end-ofsemester assessments. As was the case with homework payments, the “Cash” treatment
received assessment payments via cash/direct deposit; the “college” treatment had the funds
deposited into an account to be accessed only upon the child’s enrollment in college.
Those families that were randomly assigned to the control group did not have access
to Parent Academy sessions. They received no training or guidance from us. They were,
however, awarded $100 to incentivize them to complete the end-of-semester assessments.
IV. Data and Econometrics
A. Data
All data used in our analysis was collected for the purposes of this study. 9 We began
by collecting demographic data about children when families registered for the experiment.
Parent demographic data were collected when children took their pre-assessments in May

Parents in this group get biennial reports with a reminder of the steps required to receive payment. While we
encourage parents to apply the payment to help pay for college, there is no legal obligation for the parents to
do so.

2011, prior to the randomization. Data on children’s assessment scores were collected in the
middle of the treatment year (January 2012) and at the end of treatment (May 2012).
Our main outcome variables are the series of assessments described above. The
composite cognitive score was calculated as the average of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary
Test score and the Woodcock Johnson III Test of Achievement scores. Observations with
any of the individual assessment scores missing were given a missing cognitive score. 10 The
non-cognitive scores were calculated as the average of the Blair and Willoughby Executive
Function scores and the Preschool Self-Regulation Assessment score. Similar to cognitive
scores, observations with any of the individual assessment scores missing were given a
missing non-cognitive score.
We use a parsimonious set of controls to aid in precision and to correct for any
potential imbalance between treatment and control. The most important controls are pretreatment cognitive and non-cognitive test scores, which we include in all regressions along
with their squares. Baseline cognitive test scores are available for 76.4 percent of the sample.
The corresponding number for baseline non cognitive scores is 95.7 percent. For
observations missing baseline test scores, we substitute these with a value of 0 and include a
missing indicator that is 1 when a baseline score is missing and 0 when it is not. Note that
pre-treatment testing was done prior to randomization, so there is no differential selection
between treatment and controls on this dimension.
Other individual level controls include a mutually exclusive and collectively
exhaustive set of race dummies, child’s gender, child’s age and mother’s age. Race is taken
from demographic data collected during family registrations. Parents were asked for the date
of birth of each child at the same time; from this we construct each child’s age. Mother’s age
was taken from a parent demographic survey.
We also administered mid-year and end-of-year parent investment surveys to all
program participants. All participants were given a $25 incentive to show up to an
assessment and complete the parent incentive survey. Data from the surveys include
information on parental investment in terms of number of hours spent per weekday teaching
The majority of missing assessments is due to families being absent on assessment days, not selective test
taking conditional upon attending. The probability of a child missing all cognitive assessments, conditional on
missing one, is 0.857. Similarly, the probability of a child missing all non-cognitive assessments, conditional on
missing any one, is 0.984. Appendix Table 9 investigates covariates for our sample without this restriction. All
the results remain qualitatively similar to results that we get by applying the restriction.

their child; and beliefs about their child in terms of how they ranked relative to other
children their age in reading and math skills.
Given the combination of data collected at different times over the course of a year,
sample sizes will differ for various outcomes tested, due to missing data. Table 2 provides an
accounting of sample sizes across various outcomes. For instance, the bottom panel of
Table 2 demonstrates that 76% of the experimental sample have at least one valid end of
year test score. This amounts to 79.8% of the control group, 78.4% of the cash treatment
group and 69.1% of the college treatment group.
Below we detail our main experimental estimates, which come from a standard
treatment effects model of the form Yi = g(.) + εi, where we use Z as an indicator for
assignment to our parent academy treatment. Our inference hinges on random treatment
assignment, which implies 𝐸𝐸(𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖 |𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 ) = 0. Table 3 examines observed differences between

individuals assigned to treatment and individuals assigned to control. All covariates are
balanced between the treatment groups and between treatment and control; no p-values are
statistically significant. A joint F-test that all differences between means are equal to zero has
a p-value of 0.723.
Roughly one-fourth of our subjects do not have final assessment scores. Ultimately,
it is this sample of the data (what we term the “analysis sample”) for which we require
𝐸𝐸(𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖 |𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 ) = 0. Therefore, we report summary statistics by treatment conditional on having a

year-end test score in the final four columns of Table 3. The treatment and control samples
remain balanced on all baseline covariates. A joint F-test that all coefficients are equal to

zero has a p-value of 0.835. This does not preclude unobserved differences between the
groups (see section V.II of this paper for further discussion), but at least demonstrates there
are not obvious disparate patterns in who is showing up for the assessments across
treatments.
B. Econometric model
We estimate two empirical models – Intent-to-Treat (ITT) effects and Local Average
Treatment Effects (LATE) – which provide a set of causal estimates on the effect of
parental incentives on early childhood cognitive and non-cognitive achievement. The ITT
effect, τITT, is estimated from the equation below:
(1)

Yi = α + τITT ∙ Zi + f (Yi, T-1) + βXi + εi,
11

where Zi is an indicator for assignment to any parent academy treatment and let Xi be a
vector of control variables consisting of demographic variables in Table 3, and let 𝑓𝑓(∙)

represent a polynomial including baseline cognitive and non-cognitive scores prior to the
start of treatment and their squares. Yi represents the outcome variable while Yi,T-1 represents
the pre-treatment value of the outcome variable.
The ITT is an average of the causal effects for children whose parents signed up to
participate in the parental incentive program and were randomly selected for treatment or
control. Put differently, ITT provides an estimate of the impact of being offered the chance to
participate in a parental incentive program. We only include children in treatment and
control who were randomly assigned. All parent mobility after random assignment is
ignored.
Under several assumptions (that treatment assignment is random, that being assigned
to treatment has a monotonic impact on Parent Academy enrollment, and that being
selected for treatment affects outcomes through its effect on Parent Academy enrollment),
we can also estimate the causal impact of attending the Parents Academy. This parameter,
commonly known as the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE), measures the average
effect of attending the Parent Academy on children whose parents attended as a result of
being assigned to treatment (Angrist and Imbens 1995).
The LATE parameter, ATTEND, can be estimated through a two-stage least squares
regression of child achievement on parental attendance in the Parent Academy, using the
lottery offer Zi as an instrumental variable for the first stage regression. The second-stage
equations of the two-stage least squares estimates therefore take the following form:
(2)

Yi = α + ΩATTENDi + f (Yi, T-1 ) + βXi + εi

and the first stage equation is:
(3)

ATTENDi = α + λZi + f (Yi, T-1) + βXi + εi ,

where all other variables are defined in the same way as in Equation (1). λ measures the
impact of treatment assignment on the probability of attending the Parent Academy. We
12

estimate equations (2) and (3) using a continuous variable measuring the fraction of sessions
parents were attendance at Parent Academy in 2011-2012. Therefore, ATTEND takes all
values between 0 and 1.
There is a powerful first stage effect of being assigned to treatment on Parent
Academy attendance. None of the parents assigned to the control group attended any of the
Parent Academy session, compared to 88 percent of those who were assigned to “cash”
treatment and 81 percent of those assigned to “college” treatment. Forty nine percent of
parents who were assigned to “cash” treatment and 41 percent of parents assigned to
“college” treatment attend all sessions. Appendix Table 3 presents formal first stage
estimates. All first stage coefficients are large, positive, and statistically significant. The
coefficients differ slightly between regressions as the sample being considered changes size
according to non-missing outcome variables; F statistics range from 156.532 to 870.232. 11
V. Experimental Results
Table 4 presents ITT and LATE estimates of the impact of parental incentives on
end-of-year measures of cognitive and non-cognitive skills. 12 All results are presented in
standard deviation units. Standard errors, corrected for heteroskedasticity, are in parentheses
beneath each estimate.
The impact of parental incentives on cognitive achievement is statistically zero, but
not trivial in size. The LATE estimate for families in the cash condition is 0.079𝜎𝜎 (0.109)
and 0.184𝜎𝜎 (0.120) for individuals in the college condition; the pooled estimate is 0.131𝜎𝜎
(0.099). Using the cost-benefit framework in Krueger (2003), one can show that effect sizes
as low as 0.10𝜎𝜎 have a return on investment approximately equal to 5%.
In contrast, the impact of parental incentives on non-cognitive skills is larger and
statistically significant. The LATE estimate for the “cash” condition is 0.225𝜎𝜎 (0.104) and
0.217𝜎𝜎 (0.104) for the “college” condition. These results are consistent with Kautz et al.
(2014), who argue that parental investment is an important contributor to non-cognitive
development.
Appendix Figure 1 plots the distribution of the number of sessions of Parent Academy attendance by
treatment assignment.
12 We also conducted mid-year assessments. The pattern of point estimates are consistent with those of the
assessments done at year end, but are generally smaller in magnitude, as would be expected. Full results for the
mid-year assessments are available in Appendix Table 4.

These overall results mask interesting heterogeneity among subsamples of the
population that we blocked to observe. This fact is demonstrated in Table 5, which
presents LATE estimates, pooling the “cash” and “college” results, for different groups in
the sample. Rows (2)-(4) of Table 5 divide our sample along racial lines into Blacks,
Hispanics, and Whites. We obtain negative, but statistically insignificant treatment effects on
Blacks for both cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes, i.e. Blacks in our treatment groups,
on average, fared worse than Blacks in the control group, but the effect is not significant at
conventional levels.
In stark contrast, Hispanic students demonstrate remarkable increases in both
cognitive (0.367𝜎𝜎; 0.133) and non-cognitive (0.428𝜎𝜎; 0.122) scores. For the small sample of
Whites, the point estimates are even larger (0.932𝜎𝜎; 0.353) on cognitive and (0.821𝜎𝜎; 0.181)
on non-cognitive, both of which are again statistically significant at conventional levels.
Equality of the Black scores and the other races are easily rejected. 13 We consider this to be
one of the most intriguing findings in the paper and explore possible explanations for the
result in Section VII.
The differences along gender lines, shown in the second panel of the table, are more
muted. The point estimates are similar on cognitive scores. In the non-cognitive domain,
point estimates are larger for girls, but not statistically significantly so.
When we divide our sample along three dimensions that may correlate with
differential likelihoods of being at risk for parental underinvestment (i.e. by family income,
mother’s age, number of siblings), the coefficients suggest our experiment was more
effective for children in higher risk groups. 14 Due to missing data along each of these
Hispanics and Whites continue to outperform Blacks when we take into account the probability of making
one or more false discoveries – known as type I errors – when performing multiple hypothesis tests, using a
step-down algorithm as described by Romano and Wolf (2005) and Romano, Shaikh and Wolf (2008).
14 Parent’s income is collected from the Parent Demographic Survey we conducted. This variable is categorical
(see the data appendix for details). Per capita income for Chicago Heights is $17, 546. The median category of
income in our experimental sample is “3” which represents income values between $16,000 and $25,000. The
experimental sample is divided into two subsamples – observations with income categories above or equal to
median value of “3”, and observations with income categories below median value of “3”. Mother’s age is
collected from the same Parent Demographic Survey. The mean mother’s age in the experimental sample is
31.40 years and the median is 31 years. For the subsamples table, we divide the experimental sample into two
subsamples – observations with mother’s age above or equal to the median value of 31 years, and observations
with mother’s age below the median value of 31 years. We also create subsamples based on the number of
children in the household. This variable measures the total number of children between ages 0 – 18 that live in
the household, including the child in the parent incentive program. The mean number of children living in a
household present in the experimental sample is 2.46 and the median is 2. The sample is split in the manner
above – observations with number of children in the household greater than the median value of 2 and
13

14

dimensions, the number of observations does not add up to the total sample size. The
effects are greater for young mothers and families with below median income. Family size
has a less clear cut impact.
The final panel of Table 5 divides the sample by test score prior to the experiment.
The point estimates suggest that children who start with below average cognitive scores derive
a greater benefit in the cognitive domain from our treatment. Pre-treatment cognitive scores
do not have a large impact on non-cognitive gains. An even sharper pattern emerges with
respect to pre-treatment non-cognitive scores. Students who enter the program above the
median in non-cognitive experience large gains in both cognitive and non-cognitive skills. In
stark contrast, those who start below the median in non-cognitive gain nothing from the
program. One interpretation of this result is that sufficiently developed non-cognitive skills
are a necessary input for learning. 15
The last four rows of the table sort students simultaneously on both their cognitive
and non-cognitive pre-scores (i.e., four groups corresponding to above the median on both,
below the median on both, or one above and one below). The greatest gains on both
dimensions accrue to the students who start high on non-cognitive and low on cognitive.
These students have treatment effects of 0.343𝜎𝜎 (0.169) on cognitive and 0.469𝜎𝜎 (0.146) on
non-cognitive. Those who start high on cognitive and low on non-cognitive skills actually
experience significantly negative treatment effects on cognitive from our program and show
no benefit on non-cognitive.
V.II Robustness to Attrition
As noted earlier, roughly one-fourth of the students in our randomization are
missing final scores. Table 6 shows that the frequency of missing outcomes varies
somewhat across treatment assignment. Children in the “cash” treatment, for instance, are
5.9 (6.7) percentage points less likely to be missing a score while children in “college” are 3.9
observations with number of children in the household less than or equal to 2. The final split of samples is
done according to pre-treatment scores. In the top panel of Table 5 where the outcome variable is standardized
end year cognitive score, the splitting is done on the basis of the median pre-treatment cognitive score. In the
bottom panel, where the outcome variable is standardized end year non-cognitive score, the splitting is done on
the basis of the median pre-treatment non-cognitive score.
There are, of course, other explanations. For instance, if there is a strong genetic component to noncognitive skills, than students with low non-cognitive skills will also tend to have parents with low noncognitive skills. Parents with low non-cognitive skills might themselves be ineffective learners or ineffective
teachers of their children.

15

15

(6.8) percentage points more likely to be missing a score. Pooling both treatments, children in
treatment are 0.8 (5.8) percentage points less likely to be missing an end year cognitive score.
For end year non-cognitive assessments, the cash treatment group is 1.2 (6.7) percentage
points more likely to be missing a score while the college treatment group is 8.5 (6.6)
percentage points more likely to be missing a score. Pooling both treatments, the treatment
group is 4.7 (5.2) percentage points more likely to be missing a non-cognitive score. If
children who are missing cognitive or non-cognitive scores differ in important ways between
treatment and control, our estimates may be biased.
There are many ways of accounting for attrition (Lee 2009). One popular approach
among economists is that of Lee (2009), which calculates conservative bounds on the true
treatment effects under the assumption that attrition is driven by the same forces in
treatment and control, but that there are differential attrition rates in the two samples.
Under the Lee method, children are selectively dropped from either the treatment or control
group to equalize response rates. Specifically, this is accomplished by regressing the
outcome variable on all controls and treatment status. When the probability of missing an
outcome is higher for the control group, then treatment children with the highest residuals are
dropped. When the probability of missing an outcome is higher for the treatment group,
then control children with the lowest residuals are dropped. In our case, however, because
the attrition rates are quite similar between treatment and control the impact on our
estimates is small. The pooled cognitive estimates are unaffected; the non-cognitive
estimates shrink by roughly 25 percent, but are still statistically significant at the p < .05 level
(see Table 7).
A more pernicious form of attrition bias occurs when the reasons for attrition differ
across treatment and control groups. For instance, if the lowest gaining children are
systematically missing from final assessments in the treatment group (e.g. because dishonest
researchers could identify these children in advance and not invite them to take the final
assessment), but the highest gaining children go unassessed in the control group, then the
attrition bias can be extreme. Given that there were no obvious observable dimensions on
which the missing students differed in Table 3, we have no reason to suspect this sort of
differential selection is at work. As one check on this possibility, we utilize the fact that we
conducted interim tests halfway through the program. We compute the test score changes
from pre-treatment to interim testing among all students who showed up for the interim
16

test, but not for the final assessments, looking for systematic differences across those in
treatment versus control.
Empirical results are displayed in Appendix Table 15. Sample sizes are small (there
are less than 30 students in total, split about evenly across treatment and control, who take
the interim test but not the final assessment) and the results are indeterminate. On cognitive
scores, gains between pre-treatment and the midterm by treatment group students who later
attrite are larger than among the corresponding group of control students. For noncognitive scores, the reverse is true. Thus, there is no definitive pattern of systematic
attrition.
Nonetheless, it must be noted that with attrition rates like the ones we have in our
sample (roughly one-fourth), any formal bounding technique which takes a pessimistic
stance with respect to the source of attrition (e.g. giving every missing treatment student a
score one standard deviation below the mean and giving every missing control student a
score one standard deviation above the mean) would negate any positive findings of our
treatment.
VII. Understanding Racial Differences in Treatment Effectiveness
As noted above, we obtain large and statistically significant differences in treatment
effects between Blacks and others. In this section, we provide a more speculative discussion
of what may explain the racial differences in treatment effects, focusing mostly on the gap
between Blacks and Hispanics because our sample of Whites is so small. We explore a series
of hypotheses in turn.
Did Black parents invest less heavily in the program?
One simple explanation for racial differences would be lesser engagement on the
part of Black parents. The top panel of Table 8 explores this hypothesis. Each row of the
table corresponds to a different measure of parental engagement. Column (1) reports means
for the entire sample and columns (2) and (3) for Blacks and Hispanics, respectively. The
final column presents a p-value of the null hypothesis of equality across columns (2) and (3).
Blacks attend slightly more sessions than Hispanics, but are slightly worse on the other four
dimensions we measure (tardiness, homework completed, average homework grade, and
average amount of payment received for homework). None of the differences are
17

statistically significant at the p < .05 level, and the economic magnitude of the differences
are small. For example, black parents turn in 0.06 fewer homework assignments on average.
Is race simply a proxy for other observable characteristics?
In the sensitivity analysis shown in Table 5, we found that certain types of children
derived more benefit from our program (e.g. when they start with high non-cognitive scores
or come from low-income families). To the extent that these characteristics are correlated
with race, Hispanic status may not directly affect treatment outcomes, but rather only be
correlated with treatment outcomes through these mediating factors. We explore this
hypothesis in two ways. First, we present summary statistics by race in the bottom panel of
Table 8. Hispanic mothers are almost three years younger on average than Black mothers
(this difference is statistically significant), but none of the measures of income, family size, or
pre-treatment test scores are very different. Second, we more formally examine the impact
of these covariates in Table 9. Each column of Table 9 corresponds to a different regression
specification. The dependent variable is the cognitive year-end test score in the first three
columns and the non-cognitive year end test score in columns 4-6. In each case, we include
treatment dummies, race dummies, all covariates from Table 3 and an interaction between
treatment and Black that picks up the difference in treatment effects between Blacks and the
rest of the sample. The first and fourth columns include no family based controls. The
second and fifth columns add the controls in the second panel of Table 8. The third and
sixth column includes both controls and interactions between the controls and Black. The
coefficient of interest is the interaction between Black and treatment – the differential
treatment effect on Blacks.
If differences in observable characteristics help explain the racial patterns, then the
coefficients in the top row will shrink moving from columns 1 to 3 and from columns 4 to
6. As can be seen in the table, however, the inclusion of these controls has little impact on
that parameter estimate. For instance, moving from column 1 to 2 slightly increases the
estimate by 2.71 percent. The additional covariates in column 3 have no significant impact
whatsoever. For non-cognitive, the pattern is similar, with covariates explaining only 5.21
percent of the gap between Blacks and others.
Can selection on unobservables explain why Blacks do so poorly in our program?
18

Altonji et al. (2000) describe a way to quantify the amount of selection bias on
unobservables required to make treatment effects insignificant. Their main assumption is
that selection on unobservables is equal to selection on observables. This helps us calculate
how strong implied selection bias on unobservables would need to be to make the
differences between Blacks and Hispanics insignificant. A way to represent the bias is to
write it as a ratio of the main ITT effect divided by the implied bias. Appendix Table 7
shows that the implied ratio for Hispanics shows that the bias caused by unobservables has
to be 10.149 times what it now is to be able to make the treatment effect on cognitive score
statistically insignificant. The corresponding implied ratio for non-cognitive score is almost
148. This suggests selection on unobservables is unlikely to explain the pattern of racial
effects we observe.
Do the pattern of outcomes across different components of the test provide any clues regarding the
racial differences?
Thus far, we have presented only summary measures for cognitive and non-cognitive
scores. Disaggregating the tests into their underlying components might potentially shed
light on why Black performance lags if the racial differences were concentrated in particular
areas. In actuality, however, the racial differences appear across the board. 16 The treatment
effect on Blacks is smaller in every sub-component of both the cognitive and non-cognitive
tests, and statistically significantly so for the majority of these components. Thus, a
disaggregation of test scores proves not to be elucidating on this dimension.
The “home language theory”
Prior research has found that early childhood interventions have had a greater impact
on households where English is not spoken at home. Currie and Thomas (1999) show that
Head Start pre-schools impact native born Hispanics and Mexicans more than foreign-born
Hispanics. 17 Wagner and Clayton (1999) find that children of Latina mothers derived greater
benefit from the Parents as Teachers program, and children of Spanish speaking Latinas
For full results, see Appendix Tables 5 and 6.
For example, in the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, the effect of Head Start pre-schools compared to
other pre-schools is 9.88 for native-born Hispanics while it is 2.21 for foreign born Hispanics. Among foreign
born Hispanics, children who spoke Spanish at home did better than children who spoke English at home. The
corresponding estimates are 18.22 and 1.15 in the same test.

16

benefitted most. 18 Gentzkow and Shapiro (2008) show that television viewing among preschool children increases standardized test scores by 0.0157 for children who speak English
at home and 0.0766 for those who do not speak English at home.
While this cannot explain the strong performance of Whites in our program, it may
account for some of the differences between Blacks and Hispanics. We therefore investigate
differences in treatment effectiveness for Hispanic children who speak English at home
versus children who speak mainly Spanish at home in Appendix Table 8. Our findings with
respect to cognitive scores are entirely consistent with the home language hypothesis: the
pooled treatment effect for Spanish speaking Hispanics is 0.424𝜎𝜎(0.162) while for English
speaking Hispanics the point estimate is -0.029𝜎𝜎(0.205).
The home language theory cannot, however, explain racial differences in treatment
effects on non-cognitive skills. English speaking Hispanics actually have larger point
estimates for non-cognitive scores (0.573𝜎𝜎(0.242)) than Spanish speaking Hispanics
(0.293𝜎𝜎(0.136)), although these differences are not statistically significant (p-value= 0.313.)
Compared to English speaking Blacks, English speaking Hispanics do significantly better on
non-cognitive outcomes with the p-value of the difference in treatment effects between the
two groups equal to 0.022.
VIII. Conclusions
There is a large literature demonstrating a robust correlation between parental inputs
and student achievement (Nye, Schwartz and Turner 2006). We demonstrate that providing
financial incentives (and a curriculum) to families to engage in activities with their children
that stimulate both cognitive and non-cognitive growth, has a modest and statistically
insignificant effect on cognitive scores and a large and statistically significant impact on noncognitive achievement. Estimates of the effects separately by race reveals that Hispanic and
White students do extremely well as a result of the intervention, but that Blacks gain
nothing.
We explore a range of hypotheses that might explain these racial differences, finding
little support for any of them except that speaking Spanish at home is associated with large
As was the case for Blacks in our sample, in the Parents as Teachers study, children of non-Latina mothers
actually score lower than their control group counterparts.

cognitive gains for Hispanics (similar to Currie and Thomas (1999) and Gentzkow and
Shapiro (2008)). Yet, we are unable with that theory to explain the large racial differences in
non-cognitive growth, or the strong cognitive impact of the program on Whites. We also
find that program effects are concentrated among those who have strong non-cognitive
skills when entering the program, especially those students who also test poorly in the
cognitive domain upon entry.
Our study demonstrates the viability of a new approach to early education:
financially rewarding parents for attending a parent academy and investing in their children
as a homework assignment. At the same time, our findings raise important public policy
implications due to the enormous heterogeneity we observe in treatment effects.

Appendix A: Implementation Appendix
Marketing and Recruitment
To begin recruitment, there was a four-week online contest for graphic designers to
create a logo for the experiment (see Appendix Figure 2). The next step was to develop a
website for families and community members to learn about the GECC, in English and
Spanish (see http://checckids.org/). We created posters, fliers, and brochures in both
English and Spanish. There were informational luncheons held for district staff and
community leaders to inform them about the experiment and then information request
forms and FAQs were distributed. All materials were available in English and Spanish.
Articles were also published in district newsletters profiling the experiment.
Automated messages in both English and Spanish were sent to all District 170 homes to
inform the community of upcoming events. The program also staffed District 170 report
card pick-up days to provide information to parents about the experiment, and staffed tables
at local supermarkets, community events, and other outlets to inform families. Program
managers worked with community groups to identify families not being served and sent
them more than 20,000 pieces of mail to families in Chicago Heights and neighboring
communities.
Interested families were entered into a lottery. The first 150 families to be picked
were offered enrollment in the Griffin Early Childhood Center preschool program and the
next 128 families were offered enrollment in the parent incentives experiment. 19 The
remaining families were asked to serve as a control group. Program managers spent the next
couple of weeks encouraging and confirming family participation.
Curriculum Selection
We searched for existing curricula that would teach parents to help their children
with both cognitive skills (such as spelling and counting) as well as non-cognitive skills (such
as memory and self-control). It is unusual for a curriculum to address both of these areas.
Moreover, there are very few parent curriculums that have been evaluated by randomized
control trials. None of the reviewed curricula fulfilled the requirements of the project, so a
curriculum had to be composed by the team. We decided to take effective pre-school

curriculum for teaching cognitive and non-cognitive skills and use them as a guide to
develop the Parent Academy curriculum.
To begin curriculum selection, we assessed pre-existing curriculum using information
from the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) at the US Department of Education’s Institute
of Education Sciences (IES) because of their extensive review of early childhood education
interventions and curriculum models. We reviewed 102 studies of interventions and found
that 22 met WWC criteria for rigor. We looked at the evidence from these studies to assess
how effective each intervention was in six categories: oral language, print knowledge,
phonological processing, early reading and writing, cognition, and mathematics. Any
intervention that had any achieved positive effects in at least one area, without any negative
findings passed the initial screening.
Of the nine interventions that passed this screen, Literacy Express was the choice for
the literary focus curriculum. Literacy Express is often included in classroom packages and
combines aspects of multiple literacy programs. To supplement Literacy Express, Pre-K
Mathematics was chosen, because it had been paired with Literacy Express in the past (CITES).
The non-cognitive curriculum was chosen after a conversation with experts from the
Erikson Institute, The Development Network at The University of Chicago, The Boston
Children’s Museum’s Instructional Team, The Harvard Graduate School of Education, The
Sesame Workshop and others. Tools of the Mind was the curriculum selection because of its
focus on self-regulation and executive function. The program is based on Vygotskian’s
theory that gaining these skills before learning cognitive skills will allow better retention of
cognitive skills later on (Bodrova and Leong, 2007).
To build the Parent Academy, the two preschool curricula were separated into their
individual parts. The Parent Academy Director created lesson plans for 18 sessions, which
were revised by the research team in two rounds of revisions. All material was also translated
into Spanish. Appendix Table 1 describes the number of sessions spent, by topic, in Parent
Academy.
Parent sessions met on a bi-monthly basis, allowing two weeks in between each
session to allow for parents to engage with their children, do their homework, and staff to
grade assignments and process payments. There were eighteen, ninety-minute, lessons.
Sessions were offered in English and Spanish.

Each member of the parent academy was given a variety of assignments and their
children were given assessments. Homework assignments reinforced the learning objectives
of the sessions. Some of these assignments asked the parents to submit videos of themselves
working with their children. Children were given a major assessment at the end of each
semester and multiple shorter assessments to test whether homework assignments were
being completed, and whether they were effective.
Financial Incentives
Each Parent Academy participant had the opportunity to earn up to $7,000 a year
and could participate until their children entered kindergarten. Parents could earn financial
incentives through a variety of methods. Participants were given up to $100 per session for
attendance and up to $100 per session for completion of quality homework. Both payments
were scaled. For attendance, parents received $100 for arriving on time or less than 5
minutes after the session began. They received $50 for being “tardy” or arriving between 5
and 30 minutes late. Finally, if they arrived more than 30 minutes late or not at all, they did
not receive any cash payment. For homework incentives, parents received $100, $60, $30, or
$0 depending upon whether they received A, B, C, or I(incomplete) grade on their
homework assignment. Parents could also earn up to $1800 a year for evaluations based on
the child’s performance. Finally, parents could earn up to $800 for each of the two major
end-of-semester assessments. We provided all participants with oral and written directions
and explanations of the rubric before each assignment and assessment so that parents had
full knowledge of the requirements needed for each award.
Participants were randomly assigned to two payment options – a cash incentive or
college incentive. Individuals in the cash incentive group received payments once a month
following completed sessions.
Parents in the college group were paid for attendance only during the program and
on the same schedule as the cash incentive group. The balance of the money that they
earned during the program was put into a fund and will be given to the parents only when
they send proof that their children have enrolled in a full-time postsecondary institution.
Parents in this group get biennial reports with a reminder of the steps required to receive
payment. While we encourage parents to apply the payment to help pay for college, there is
no legal obligation for the parents to do so.

Assessments
To identify the appropriate assessments to be used in the experiment, we evaluated
norm-referenced assessment batteries currently being used in the social sciences, conducted
a series of interviews with experts in early childhood and developmental psychology, and
hosted a two-day conference where leading experts convened to discuss assessment
strategies.
The assessments started with a five-minute language screen to learn language
preference. Children were then given both cognitive and non-cognitive assessments.
Cognitive Assessments
1. The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (Pearson) – PPVT-III is a leading measure of
receptive vocabulary for standard English (Spanish) and a screening test of verbal
ability. This is a norm-referenced standardized assessment that can be used with
subjects with ages 2-90+. The test is not times, and takes approximately 5 to 20
minutes to compete (Dunn and Dunn, 1965).
2. Woodcock Johnson III Test of Achievement (Riverside Publishing) – The WJ-III is
a normed set of tests for measuring general intellectual ability, specific cognitive
abilities, oral language, and academic achievement. This is a norm-referenced
standardized assessment that can be used with subjects 2-80+. The test is not timed,
and each sub-test takes approximately 5-10 minutes (Woodcock, McGrew, and
Mather, 2001). It uses the following sub-tests –
a. Letter Word Identification: Measures ability to identify letters and words
b. Spelling: Measures ability to draw shapes and trace lines, and in older ages,
write orally presented letters and words.
c. Applied Problems: Measures ability to analyze and solve math problems.
d. Quantitative Concepts: Measures knowledge of mathematical concepts and
symbols.
Non-cognitive Assessments

29

1. Blair and Willoughby Measures of Executive Function – This battery of executive
function tasks includes “Operation Span” that measures the construct of working
memory, asking children to identify and remember pictures of animals; and “Spatial
Conflict II: Arrows” that measures the construct of inhibitory control, asking
children to match 37 arrow cards in sequence (Blair and Willoughby, 2006).
2. Preschool Self-Regulation Assessment – Assessor Report – The PSRA report is
designed to assess self-regulation in emotional, attentional and behavioral domains.
This battery of assessments was given at the beginning of the program to obtain an
accurate profile of each student, and was then given at the end of each semester. It was
administered by a team of administrators who all held Bachelor’s degrees and were trained in
assessment implementation. It was graded by pen and paper and then coded electronically.
Random Assignment
All families registered to be in the parent incentive program were randomly assigned to
be a part of the two treatment groups and control group. The random assignment was done
to balance gender, race, home language, self-reported home language ability, self-reported
English language ability, pre assessment scores, location of residence, median city income,
mother’s education level and if that was missing, preference for Parent Academy or other
pre-school intervention, and whether the child has a social security number or not.
There are a few caveats to our randomization procedure. Before the program began
in 2011-2012, there was a pilot program held in 2010-2011 (look at Appendix Tables 10-14
for results from the pilot year). Children who had not been randomized to be a part of the
pilot year are considered “new” to the parent academy program. They were placed into the
lottery for randomization in 2011-2012. If there were new children in 2011-2012 whose
older siblings were in the pilot program, they were automatically placed into the same
treatment group as their older sibling. New children with older siblings who had left the
parent academy program were placed into the lottery. Returning children from the pilot year
were given the choice to re-enter the lottery or continue with their current placement. After
the lottery, one hundred children were randomly selected from Control and designated as
Special Control. Special control children had stronger methods of follow up during the year
and therefore, have non-missing outcomes.
30

Appendix B: Variable Construction
Child’s Age
Child’s age is taken from the registration forms that all families filled to enter themselves
into the randomization lottery. The variable is coded in years and is continuous. In the
experimental sample, the mean child’s age is 4.03 and it ranges from 3 to 5. This is in
accordance with the pre-condition issued to families before registrations that only children
between 3 to 5 years will be considered for the Parent Academy program.
Child’s Gender
Child’s gender is also taken from the registration forms that families filled before the
randomization lottery. It is coded up as 2 gender dummy variables – male and female.
Child’s Race/Ethnicity
The race/ variable is also taken from parent registration forms. We code the race variables
such that the four categories – white, black, Hispanic, and other – are complete and
mutually exclusive. Hispanic ethnicity is an absorbing state hence “white” implies nonHispanic white. However, “black” implies non-Hispanic black and Hispanic black.
Mother’s Age
Mother’s age is taken from a Parent Demographic Survey that was administered during the
Pre-Assessment Tests. The variable is coded in years. The mean mother’s age in the
experimental sample is 31.40 years and it ranges from 19 to 60 years.
Mother’s Education
Mother’s education is taken from the Parent Demographic Survey. It is a categorical variable
coded from the answer to question –
“Mom's highest grade or level of school completed?
1 – No formal schooling
2 – Less than 9th grade
3 – Some high school but no diploma

31

4 – GED
5 – High school diploma
6 – Vocational/technical program after high-school
7 – Some college but no degree
8 – AA
9 – BA
10 – MA, graduate or professional degree
11 – Other”
Where “other” responses are replaced with missing to ensure that higher numbers imply a
higher level of education.
Parent’s Income
Parent’s income is taken from the Parent Demographic Survey. It is a categorical variable
coded from the answer to question –
“What is your approximate yearly income?
1 – $0 to $5,000
2 – $6,000 to $15,000
3 – $16,000 to $25,000
4 – $26,000 to $35,000
5 – $36,000 to $45,000
6 – $46,000 to $60,000
7 – $61,000 to $75,000
8 – over $75,000”.
Number of Children in the Household
This variable is coded from the answer to the question below, asked in the Parent
Demographic Survey –
“How many children (ages 0 – 18) live in your household, including your child?”
Home Language

32

Home language is taken from the registration forms parents filled out before randomization
took place. The variable is split into two categories – children who spoke only Spanish or a
bit of English at home; and children who spoke only English at home.
Pre-treatment Scores
Pre-treatment scores were collected during the Pre-Assessment Tests. The pre-treatment
cognitive score is calculated as the average of the WJ-III letter word identification score, WJIII applied problems score, WJ-III spelling score, WJ-III quantitative problems score, and
the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test score. The score is replaced as missing if any of these
scores are missing. As all individual assessment scores are between [0,100], the cognitive
score ranges between [0,100]. The pre-treatment non-cognitive score is calculated as the
average of the Pre-school Self-Regulation Assessment score, Blair and Willoughby operation
span score, and Blair and Willoughby spatial conflict score. The score is replaced as missing
if any of the three scores are missing. The individual assessment scores are between [0,1].
Hence, the non-cognitive score ranges between [0,1].
Test Scores used as Outcome Variables
Both mid-year and end-of year cognitive and non-cognitive scores are calculated as averages
of individual assessments in the manner of pre-treatment scores. These scores are further
standardized by year.
Treatment
Treatment is defined as the parent incentive group that the child was randomized into in the
lottery. For regressions that contain two treatment variables for the cash condition and the
college condition, the cash treatment variable is taken as 1 for children in cash treatment and
0 for children in college treatment or control. Similarly, the college treatment variable is
coded as 1 for children in college treatment and 0 for children in cash treatment or control.
For regressions that contain only a single pooled treatment variable, the variable is coded as
1 for children in either cash or college treatment arm and 0 for control children only.
Attendance Rates

33

Attendance in treatment is calculated as the fraction of sessions that parents attended in
2011-2012. As there were 18 sessions in total, this variable takes the total number of sessions
that parents attended in the year and divides it by 18. Thus the variable is continuous and
varies between [0,1].

Notes: This table describes how we obtain different samples from the randomization sample. The first row tabulates all children who were
randomized to get treatment in 2011-2012. The second row tabulates all children who were present in the randomization sample excluding siblings
who belonged to the same treatment. This is done to make sure that all children that are included in the regressions have equal probability of
getting randomized into treatment. We call this the experimental sample. The third row displays the number of children from the experimental
sample who have non-missing end-year cognitive scores. The fourth row displays the number of children from the experimental sample who have
non-missing end-year non-cognitive scores. The first row from the bottom panel calculates the number of children that have either a non-missing
end-year congitive score or a non-missing end-year non-cognitive score. The final row calculates the percentage of children from the experimental
sample that have at least one non missing end-year test score.

Notes: This table presents bounded estimates to provide a conservative bound on the true treatment effects under the assumption that these are
differential attrition rates in the treatment and control groups. Columns (1) reports 2SLS estimates on test scores while column (2) reports the Lee
bound estimates on test scores. Column (3) reports the p-value for the difference in the estimates reported in columns (1) and (2). The dependent
variable is the cognitive score or non-cognitive score standardized by year to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. All specifications
adjust for the child-level and parent-level demographic variables summarized in Table 3, pre-treatment cognitive and non-cognitive scores and
missing indicators for them. Standard errors (reported in parentheses) are corrected for heteroskedasticity. *, **, and *** denote significance at the
90%, 95% and 99% confidence levels, respectively.

Notes: This table presents the estimates of the effects of being offered or attending parent academy on standardized end of year cognitive and
non-cognitive scores in 2011-2012 for different regression specifications. Each column stands for a different specification. Columns (1)-(3) report
2SLS estimates on end of year cognitive score while columns (4)-(6) report 2SLS estimates on end of year non-cognitive score. All specifications
adjust for the child-level and parent-level demographic variables summarized in Table 3, pre-treatment cognitive and non-cognitive scores and
missing indicators for them. All specifications also include an interaction between treatment status and Black dummy. Columns (1) and (4) include
no family based controls. Columns (2) and (5) add controls in the second panel of Table 8. Columns (3) and (6) includes all controls from the
second panel of Table 8 and ionteractions between these controls and Black dummy. Standard errors (reported in parentheses) are corrected for
heteroskedasticity. *, **, and *** denote significance at the 90%, 95% and 99% confidence levels, respectively.
