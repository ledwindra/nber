    "abstract": "\n\nIntroducing a new survey of U.S. firms\u2019 inflation expectations, we document key stylized facts involving what U.S. firms know and expect about inflation and monetary policy. The resulting time series of firms\u2019 inflation expectations displays unique dynamics, distinct from those of households and professional forecasters. By any typical definition of \u201canchored\u201d expectations, the inflation expectations of U.S. managers appear far from anchored, much like those of households. And like households, U.S. managers are largely uninformed about recent aggregate inflation dynamics or monetary policy. These results complement existing evidence on firms\u2019 inflation expectations from other countries and confirm that inattention to inflation and monetary policy is pervasive among U.S. firms as well.\n\n",
