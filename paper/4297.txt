A COMPARISON OF CHANGES
IN THE STRUCTURE OF WAGES
IN FOUR OECD COUNTRJES

ABSTRACT
This paper compares changes in the structure of wages in France, Great Britain, Japan,
and the United States over the last twenty years. Wage differentials by education and occupation

(skill differentials) narrowed substantially in all four countries in the 1970s. Overall wage
inequality and skill differentials expanded dramatically in Great Britain and the United States and

moderately in Japan during the 1980s. In contrast, wage inequality did not increase much in
France through the mid-1980s. Industrial and occupational shifts favored mom-educated workers

in all four countries throughout the last twenty years. Reductions in the rate of the growth of
the relative supply of college-educated workers in the face of persistent increases in the relative

demand for more-skilled labor can explain a substantial portion of the increase in educational
wage differentials in the United States, Britain, arid Japan in the 1980s. Sharp increases in the
national minimum wage (the SMIC) and the ability of French unions to extend contracts even
in the face of declining membership helped prevent wage differentials from expanding in France

through the mid-1980s.

I. Introduction
In the 1 970s, the relative earnings advantage of highly-educated workers, particularly
recent or young university graduates, deteriorated in the United States and most other OECD
nations Freeman, 1981). This decline coincided with a pattern of decreasing wage differentials

by occupation throughout much of the developed world. The narrowing of skill differentials in
the 1 970s appears to have been strongly related to dramatic increases in the relative supply of

highly-educated workers generated by the labor force entrance of baby-boom cohorts and the

rapid expansion of higher education. Explicit governmental and trade union policies aimed at
reducing earnings differentials are also likely to have been an important factor in many countries.
In contrast to the experience of the 1970s, wage differentials by education and occupation

expanded dramatically in the United States in the 1980s.' Over the past ten years, the U.S.
wage structure also changed substantially along several other dimensions: differentials by
experience rose for less-educated workers, earnings inequality within education-experiencegender groups increased, and gender differentials narrowed. These changes generated a large

increase in overall wage inequality among both men and women and led to a particularly sharp
deterioration in the relative earnings of young, less-educated men.
Many explanations have been offered for recent U.S. wage structure developments. One
class of explanations argues that rising education differentials and narrowing gender differentials

reflect shifts in the relative demand for labor favoring "more-skilled over less-skilleW' workers
and possibly women over men. Candidates for shifts in demand favoring more-skilled workers

include technological changes associated with the spread of computers and computer-based
technology that reduce the demand for physical labor and increase the demand for workers able

to learn at least cost (8erman, 8ound, and Griliches, 1992; Krueger, 1993; and Mincer, 1991);

the loss of manufacturing jobs offering relatively high pay to less-educated workers; and the
transfer of jobs requiring relatively routinized tasks to low-wage countries (Reich, 1991). Other

explanations focus on changes in wage-setting institutions such as the declining influence of
unions (Freeman. 1991). the erosion of the real value of the minimum wage (Blackburn, Bloom,

and Freeman, 1990), and changes in pay-setting norms.

Much research attempting to evaluate these alternative explanations for changes in the

U.S. wage structure in the 1980s (e.g. Bound and Johnson, 1992; Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce,

1989; and Katz and Murphy, 1992) has attempted to exploit U.S. time series information by
essentially comparing the experience of the 1 960s with the experiences of the I 970s and the

1960s. Katz and Murphy (1992) conclude that any consistent explanation of U.S. wage
structure changes since the late 1960s requires a rapid secular growth in the demand for
"more-skille& workers.
U.S. time series information alone is probably insufficient to sharply distinguish among
competing explanations for recent wage structure changes. A complementary approach is to

collect comparable time series data for several countries on wage structure changes and on

measures of changes in supply and demand for different labor inputs. Changes in wage
structures across countries not accounted for by demand and supply shifts constitute a residual

category that may be the result of a variety of factors. In particular, an examination of labor

market institutions (e.g.. minimum wages) may play an important role in understanding
differences in the evolution of relative wages across countries.2

-

In this paper, we assemble roughly comparable time series of data on changes in the

structure of wages in the United States, Britain, Japan, and France. These four countries
provide useful contrasts since they include two countries with decentralized wage setting
institutions (the United States and Britain), one representative of the relatively centralized wage

setting systems characteristic of Continental Europe (France). and a high-growth economy with

strong trade performance (Japan). We examine supply and demand and institutional

explanations for the differences in wage structure changes among these countries.
Our major findings concerning similarities and differences among these four countries in
patterns of changes in relative wages can be summarized as follows:

1. Trends in Overall Waqe Inequality by Sex: All four countries share a pattern of rising
wage inequality among both men and women in the 1 980s, but the magnitudes of the increases

differ substantially. Great Britain and the United States both displayed dramatic increases in

wage inequality during the 1 980s, while the increase in Japan was much more moderate.
France experienced declining inequality until 1984 and a moderate increase from 1984 to 1987.

2. Chanqes in Education/Occupation Differentials: Educational and nonmanual/manual
wage differentials narrowed in all four countries in the 1 970s. The college wage premium and

nonmanual/manual differentials expanded dramatically in the United States and Britain in the
1980s and moderately in Japan. Occupational differentials continued to narrow in France in the

19805 with a hint of a slight upturn for males after 1985.

3. Within Group Inequality: Wage inequality among those with similar education and
experience increased for both men and women in the United States and Britain in the 1 980s.
Within group (residual) inequality has been rising since the late 1 960s in the United States. In
contrast, within group inequality narrowed in the 1 970s in France and Britain.

We find that simple supply and demand measures go a reasonable distance towards
explaining the differences and similarities among these countries in patterns of relative wage

movements. Relative labor demand appears to have been rapidly shifting in favor of moreeducated workers in OECD countries throughout the past twenty years. But the relative supply

of college-educated workers grew rapidly enough to drive down skill differentials in all four of
our countries during the 1 970s. The pace of growth of the relative supply of highly-educated
workers decelerated substantially in the 1 980s in the United States, Britain, and Japan, and each

of these experienced rising college wage premiums in the 1 980s. An acceleration in the pace
of industrial shifts in employment away from sectors that disproportionately employ male manual

4
workers also appears to be an important part of the reason for the tremendous increase in skill
differentials in Britain in the 1 980s.
Institutional differences across the countries translated the relative demand shifts against
less-educated workers into similar outcomes of sharply rising inequality in the United States and

Britain in the 1 980s, but a very different outcome in France through the mid-i 980s. In France,

a high and pervasive minimum wage and contract extensions prevented the relative wages of

the unskilled from falling significantly, despite substantial employment declines. The French

experience appears to be consistent with the evidence from other continental European
countries, such as Germany and Italy, where significant relative demand shifts did not result in

large increases in wage differentials through the mid-1980s (Abraham and Houseman, 1992;

Erickson and Ichino, 1992). Finally, the strength of the Japanese manufacturing sector may
partially account for the much smaller magnitude of changes in skill differentials in Japan than
in Britain and the United States during the 1980s.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section Il contrasts changes in overall

wage inequality in these four countries over the last twenty-five years. Section III presents more

detailed evidence on changes in the structure of wages in the four countries. Section IV
provides supply and demand measures for each country and examines their contribution to

changes in the wage structures of the four countries. Section V provides a speculative
discussion of the role played by labor market institutions in explaining the movements in wage

differentials not accounted for by demand and supply effects. Section VI concludes.

II. Changes in Overall Wane lneoualitv

We begin by contrasting overall movements in wage inequality in France, Japan, the
United Kingdom, and the United States.3 Figure 1 summarizes movements in wage inequality

by sex for full-time workers.' The figure plots the time-series of overall wage inequality for
each group as measured by the log wage differential between the 90th and 10th percentiles of
the wage distribution for that group. The figure shows large increases in wage inequality in the

1 980s in the United States and Britain, a moderate increase in Japan, and small increase in
France starting in 1984. Panel A of Figure 1 indicates that the 90-10 log wage differential for
U.S. males increased substantially in the 1 970s (from 1.15 in 1969 to 1.30 in 1979) and even

more rapidly in the 1980s (increasing by 0.19 from 1979 to 1989). Wage inequality for U.S.
females remained stable in the 1 970s and then expanded dramatically in the 1 980s. The figure
illustrates a strong similarity in the pattern of sharply rising inequality in the United Kingdom and

the United States in the 1 980s. In contrast to the U.S. experience, earnings inequality actually

narrowed substantially in Britain in the 1 970s. Panel C shows that the 90-10 log wage
differentials for both men and women narrowed in France from 1967 to 1984 and then show
a moderate increase from 1984 to 1987. Finally panel D indicates a gradual increase in the 90-

10 log wage differential of 0.11 for men and of 0.07 for women from 1976 to 1990 in Japan.
France is the only one of the countries that shows no evidence of rising wage inequality
in the early I 980s. But increases in inequality from 1984 to 1987 suggest that France may be
experiencing relative demand shifts against the less-skilled similar to those in the United States.
Frances delayed and muted changes in wage structure may reflect labor market institutions that

4Detailed information on the sources, earnings concepts, and sample selection criteria of all the data

sets used to measure wage structure changes in this paper is presented in the data appendix. The
wage inequality measures in Figure 1 refer to the following earnings concepts and samples: (1) United
States: hourly wages (annual earnings divided by the product of weeks worked and usual weekly
hours) for full-time workers, 18-64 years old, using data from the Annual Demographic Supplements
to the March Current Populations Surveys; (2) Britain: gross hourly earnings for full-time workers from
the New Earnings Survey; (3) France: gross annual earnings adjusted for hours differences for full-time.
full-year workers from Declarations Annuelles de Salaires; and (4) Japan: monthly scheduled earnings
for regular workers from the Basic Survey on Wage Structure.

5We do not present estimates of the 90-10 differential for women prior to 1975. because of
changes in CPS between the March 1975 and 1976 surveys. We use imputation procedures for weeks
and hours worked for the survey years prior to 1976 developed by Kevin M. Murphy that have been

calibrated to fit hours and weeks worked distributions for men and not for women. Thus we are
skeptical of hourly earnings distribution estimates for women prior to 1975.

make it difficult to expand skill differentials, A system of minimum wages and contract
extensions in France means unions can have a large impact on wages even with low union
density. Smaller increases in wage inequality in Japan than in the United States and Britain may

reflect the stability of the Japan's manufacturing employment share during the 1 980s.
How did the changes in relative earnings documented in Figure 1 translate into changes
in real earnings? Figure 2 tries to answer this question by the plotting cumulative log real wage

growth of the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of the wage distributions for men in each
country. More precisely, the figure displays the log ratio of each group's real earnings in each
year relative to that group's level of real earnings in 1979 (the base year). Panels A and B show

the similar widening of the 90-10 differential in the 1 980s in Britain and the United States, but

indicate that this widening implied a 10 percent real wage decline from 1979-89 at the 10th
percentile in the U.S. wage distribution and a 10 percent real wage increase at the same point
of the British distribution. Real earnings growth was rapid throughout the earnings distribution

in France in the I 960s and 1970s and much more gradual in the 1 980s. Panel D shows that
real wages have grown rapidly for all groups in Japan over the last 15 years.
In summary, earnings inequality has increased greatly over the last twenty years in Britain

and the United States and fairly moderately in Japan. Over the same period, wage inequality
has not changed much for males and has been substantially reduced for women in France.

Ill. Wage Structure Changes in Four Countries

In this section, we turn to a more detailed examination of the patterns of relative wage
changes that underlie trends in overall wage inequality in the United States, Britain, Japan, and
France. We first separately examine the four countries using the best data available to illustrate

each country's wage structure changes. We then summarize the major differences and
similarities in patterns of relative wage changes across countries.

A. Changes in the Structure of Wages in the United States

We examine U.S. wage structure changes over the 1967 to 1991 period. Figure 3
summarizes relative wage changes for the 1967 to 1989 period using data from all twenty-three

Annual Oemographic Supplements to the March Current Population Survey (CPS) for survey
years 1968 to 1990. The wage measure is hourly earnings computed as annual earnings divided

by annual hours (annual weeks worked times usual weekly hours). Table 1 provides information

on real earnings levels and changes in real and relative earnings by sex-education-experience

groups for the 1979 to 1991 period using data from all twelve months of the CPS outgoing
rotation groups (OROs) for 1979, 1987, and 1991. The wage concept used in Table 1 is the

hourly wage measured as usual weekly earnings divided by usual weekly hours, The wage

samples used in the figure and the table consist of full-time workers (defined as those that
usually work 35 or more hours per week).
Panel A of Figure 3 documents movements in the college/high school log wage ratio for
ail males (those with 1 to 40 years of potential experience) and for new entrants (those with 1
to 5 years of potential experience). The time-series of college returns for all males is the fixedweighted average of the college/high school log wage ratios for workers in 40 experience groups

(with each group covering a single year experience interval). The returns for new entrants are
a fixed-weighted average of the ratios for corresponding five single-year experience groups. (The

weights used in all fixed-weighted averages presented for our U.S. data from the March CPSs

are the average shares of the groups in total weeks worked over the entire 1967-89 period.)
We use fixed-weighted averages to control for changes in the age composition of the different

education groups. The figure illustrates that the college wage premium is stable from 1967 to

1971, fell from 1971 to 1979, then rose sharply from 1979 to 1986, and remained at an
extremely high level at the end of the 1 980s. The swings in educational differentials were much

larger for new entrants than for older workers in the 1 970s and 1 980s

Notes: Each estimate is from a separate cross-section regression for full-time workers by sex and year
of log real hourly earnings on 10 schooling dummies (for less than 8, 9, 10, 11 • 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
and 18 or more years of schooling), a guartic in experience, interactions of all the experience terms
with three broad education level dummies (less than 12, 13-15, and 16 or more years of schooling),
two race dummies, interactions between the race dummies and the broad education level dummies,

and a metropolitan area dummy, The estimates are predicted values for white, full-time workers,
residing in a metropolitan area evaluated at the indicated education and experience levels. Earnings
levels are convened to 1991 dollars using the implicit price deflator for personal consumption
expenditures from the U.S. National Income Accounts. The data are from the CPS Outgoing Rotation
Groups for 1979, 1987, and 1991. The sample sizes in the regressions ranged from 45,140 to
69,415 observations.

presents estimated mean log real hourly wages for men and women at four education levels and

two potential experience levels in 1979, 1987, and 1991.' These adjusted means of log hourly
earnings allow us to control for changes in observed measures of group composition in making

inferences concerning real and relative wage changes. Earnings differentials widened among
each successive education category for both young workers (those with five years of experience)
and prime age workers (those with twenty-five years of experience) in the 1 980s. These relative

wage changes in a period of negative average real wage growth for males generated a decline
in the real hourly wages of young, less-educated males of 25 percent. The earnings differentials

between young college graduates and high school graduates increased by approximately 20
percent for both men and women during the 1 980s. The pace of increase in educational wage

differentials was much slower in the 1987 to 1991 period than in the 1979 to 1987 period.
Panel B of figure 3 compares movements in the log ratio of the earnings of peak earners
Ithose with 26-35 years of experience) to new entrants for college and high-school males. The

figure shows that while experience differentials expanded for both groups from 1 967 to 1989,

the time patterns of the changes differ substantially.

Experience differentials for college

graduates expanded from the early 1 970s to 1978 and since then they have declined. The gap

between wages of peak earners and new entrants for less-educated males increased sharply
from 1979 to 1987 and exhibits a minor decline at the end of the 1 990s. Table 1 shows similar

patterns extending to 1991. The 1 980s increase in experience differentials for males with
twelve or fewer years of schooling occurred in a period in which the relative supply of lesseducated new entrants was actually decreasing. The sharp decline in the earnings of less-

°Separate log hourly earnings regressions by sex for full-time workers were run in each year using
data from the CPS ORG samples. Each regression included 10 schooling dummies (for less than 8, 9,
10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 or more years of schooling), a quartic in experience, interactions
of all the experience terms with three broad education level dummies (less than 12. 13-15, and 16 or
more years of schooling), two race dummies, interactions between the race dummies and the broad
education level dummies, and a metropolitan area dummy. The estimates are predicted values for

white, full-time workers, residing in a metropolitan area evaluated at the indicated education and
experience levels. Earnings levels are convened to 1991 dollars using the implicit price deflator for
personal consumption expenditures from the U.S. National Income Accounts.

educated young males relative to bath college-educated workers and less-educated, older

workers suggests a sharp shift in demand against less-skilled workers with the bulk of
adjustment falling on younger workers and older, less-educated workers somewhat insulated
from external labor market developments by specific human capital and internal labor markets

with seniority layoff rules.

Panel C presents changes in female/male wage log ratios for high school and college
workers.' Male/female wage differentials in the United States narrowed substantially during the
1 980s. The improvement in relative female earnings in the 1 980s was slightly greater among
high school than among college workers.

The data so far analyzed in this section refer to changes in real wages for groups
distinguished by gender, education, and experience, However, given that these factors account
for only about one-third of the differences in wages across workers, there is significant room for

relative wage changes within these categories as well. We next examine changes in the

dispersion of relative wages within our gender by experience by education categories.
Empirically we do this by looking at the distribution of residuals from regressions separate
regressions for men and women in each year of log hourly wages on a set of education level

dummies, a quartic in experience fully interacted with broad education-level dummies, race
dummies, and interactions of race dummies with broad education-level dummies,
Panel 0 of figure 3 plots the time series of the difference in the 90th and 10th percentiles

of the distributions of residuals from these regressions for men and women. The figure shows

that within-group (residuall inequality expanded enormously with the 90-10 differential in log
weekly wages expanding by 0.31 for men over 1967 to 1989 period and by 0.13 for men and

015 for women from 1979 to 1989. Residual inequality started to expand in the early 1 970s
and continued rather smoothly increasing in the 1 980s. This time pattern contrasts sharply with

'The plots are of fixed-weighted averages of the female/male wage log ratios for 40 single year
experience groups for both college and high school workers.

10

the pattern for education differentials. We conclude from these differences in timing that the
general rise in within-group inequality and the rise in education premia over the 1963-87 period

are actually somewhat distinct economic phenomena. The earlier increase in within-group
inequality suggests a rise in the demand for skilr that predates the recent rise in returns to
education.

8. Changes in the Structure of Wages in Great Britain
Data that are reasonably consistent over time on wages by age, gender, occupation, and

industry for the United Kingdom are available for 1968 and for every year since 1974 from the

New Earnings Survey INES).° The NES is a sample survey of the earnings of employees in
employment in Great Britain in April of each year. While individual-level data from the NES are

not publicly available, published tabulations provide detailed cell means and information on

within-group earnings distributions for age, gender, occupation, and industry groups. We
examine earnings changes for full-time employees whose pay for the survey pay-period was not
affected by absence and use gross hourly earnings as our basic wage measure.

Figure 4 highlights major changes in relative wages in Great Britain from 1988 to 1991.
Panel A plots the nonmanual/manual log hourly wage differential for both males and females.
The time series differ from the usual manual/nonmanual differentials presented in many British
publications in that they are fixed-weighted averages of the differences in the log of the median

gross hourly wages of nonmanual and manual workers in 5 age groups for both males and
fernales. The figure shows that nonmanual/inanual differentials for men and women declined

greatly from 1 968 to 1 974, remained fairly stable from 1 974 to 1979, and then increased
sharply in the 1 980s. The fixed-weight nonmanual/manual differential increased over the 1979

'The New Earnings Survey is described in detail in UK Department of Employment (1991).

'The 5 age categories used are 21-24, 25-29, 30-39, 40-49, and 50-59 years of age. The fixed
weights are the averaQe share in total employment of each age-sex cell in the years 1974, 1979,
1984, and 1989.

to 1991 period from 0.32 to 0.46 for males and from 0.22 to 0.43 for females)°
Panel B of Figure 4 shows that experience differentials for males expanded moderately in

the second half of the 1 970s and quite substantially in the first part of the 1 980s. Similar
increases inexperience differentials are apparent for both manual and nonmanual males. Panel

C shows that gender differentials remained fairly steady from 1976 to 1987 after narrowing

dramatically under the influence of the Equal Pay Act in the early to mid-i 970s. Gender
differentials have narrowed a bit more since 1987.
Panel 0 illustrates that wage inequality within sex-age-broad occupation cells narrowed
in the 1 970s and then expanded greatly in the 1 980s. The figure plots for both men and women

the fixed-weighted average in each year of the 90-10 log hourly wage differentials of 10 ageoccupation cells.1'

In fact, wage inequality increased greatly in the 1980s in Great Britain

within both detailed occupations and within detailed occupation-industry-gender cells (Katz and

Loveman, 1990).
While the NES does not provide information on the educational attainment of employees,

reasonably comparable individual-level data on earnings, demographic characteristics, and
educational attainment are available from the General Household Surveys (GHSs) since 1974.

The GHS is an annual CR5-style survey of ten to fifteen thousand households.'2 Table 2 uses

the GHS data to examine the earnings of university graduates relative to individuals with no
"educational qualificationf over the 1974 to 1990 period. All British children must attend fulltime education until the age of 16, at which time a large portion of them leave school without

earning any educational qualifications. We use the earnings differential between those with
university degrees and those with no qualifications as a rough measure of the returns to higher

10See Adams, Maybury, and Smith (1988) for a detailed presentation of changes in wages by
occupation for males in Great Britain from 1973 to 1986.
'1The 10 cells for each sex involve the combination of five age groups (21-24, 25-29, 30-39, 4049, and 59-59) and two broad occupational categories (manual and nonmanual).

"See Schmitt (1992) for a detailed discussion of earnings and education data in the GHS.

education in Britain. Tabulations for individuals aged 16 to 60 from the 1989 Labour Force
Survey a much larger household survey than the GHS that unfortunately does not have wage

data) indicate that 11 percent of employed males and 7 percent of employed females had a
university degree of equivalent qualification, while 24 percent of employed male and 31 percent

of employed females had no qualifications.

The reported university degree differentials in Table 2 are the estimated coefficients on
a university degree dummy variable in separate regressions for men and women of log gross
weekly pay before deductions on thirteen highest education qualifications dummies, ten region

dummies, a race dummy, experience, experience squared, and month dummies)' The base
education group is those with no qualifications. Thus Table 2 compares the earnings of those
with university degrees to members of this no qualifications group with same number of years

of labor market experience. Regressions are reported for pooled samples 1974-75, 1978-79,
1982-83. and 1 988-90. The estimates indicate that the university earnings premium declined
from the mid to late 1 970s and then increased in the 1 980s. The university earnings differential

shows a pattern of increase in the 1 980s that is similar to but smaller in magnitude than the
estimated increases in nonmanual/manual differentials from the NES.

In summary, between and within group wage differentials for both men and women
narrowed in Britain from the late 1 960s to the late 1970s and then expanded tremendously in
the 1 980s. Our results from the NES concerning overall and within group changes in inequality

for males are quite similar to Schn,itts (1992) findings from the GElS for 1974-88.

C. Changes in the Structure of Wanes in Japan
We use data from the Basic Survey on Wage Structure to analyze changes in the Japanese

Wage Structure. These wage data are compiled from wage surveys of non-government

"The samples for the regressions include full-time employees from 16 to 69 years old. Year
dummies are included in all the regressions.

13

establishments with ten or more regular workers taken in June of each year. The published
wage statistics provide data on mean wages for regular workers by detailed sex-age-education

categories and of the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentile wages of regular workers for sex-age

groups. The restriction of the sample to regular workers and the exclusion of small
establishments (those with fewer than 10 regular worker) means the Basic Survey on Wage

Structure misses a substantial fraction of the Japanese labor force. These exclusions are
probably more important for women than for men. We focus on monthly scheduled earnings as
our basic wage measure since this is the most readily available measure for education-age cells.

Katz and Revenga (1989) and Davis (1992) find that levels of inequality and wage differentials
are larger when a more comprehensive measure of earnings that includes overtime earnings and

special payments (bonuses) is used, but that trends in wage differentials are quite similar for
monthly scheduled earnings and total monthly earnings.'4
Figure 5 summarizes basic changes in the pattern of Japanese relative wages from 1967

to 1 990. Panel A graphs fixed-weighted averages of log college/high school wage ratios for

male age and experience groups.'6 The college/high school wage differential by age group
compares the earnings of persons from the same high school class who went on to attain a

degree to those who did not. The analogous differential by experience group compares the
earnings of college graduates and high school graduates that entered the labor market at the
same time. The college log wage premium for those of the same age fell moderately from by

0.07 from 0-23 in 1967 to a trough of 0.17 in 1984 and expanded slightly to 0.19 in 1990.
The college/high school wage differential by experience group is essentially fiat from 1974 to

"We have also analyzed changes in wage differentials for men over the 1967-87 period using
hourly total earnings. The patterns are quite similar to those for scheduled monthly earnings. We use
monthly earnings because we do not have hours data beyond 1987.

'6The age groups are 20-24, 25-29, 30-39. 40-49, and 50-59- The experience groups cover
workers with approximately 1-2. 3-7,8-12, 13-17, 18-22, 23-27, 28-32, and 33-37 years of potential
experience. The fixed-weights are the average share of the each age (or experience) group in total
male employment over the 1967-90 period.

1990. But panel B of Figure 5 illustrates that relative earnings of college graduates did improve

markedly for new entrants from 1974 to 1990. The log difference between the starting salary

of new entrant college graduates and high school graduates increased from 0.15 in 1974 to
0.26 in 1990. The shortage of young workers in Japan since the early 1 970s does seen to have
created pressures in the labor market favoring young college graduates in the new entrant labor

market. This finding is not surprising given the immobility of workers in Japan once they have
entered the internal labor market of firms of at least moderate size.

Panel C shows that Japan does have a different pattern of changes in experience
differentials than do Britain and the United States. Although experience differentials increased
from the mid-i 970s to the early 1 980s for males in all three countries, experience differentials

declined both in the late 1 960s and the late 1980s in Japan. In fact, Japan is distinct among
the countries studied in having a smaller earnings gap between prime age and young males in
the late 1 980s/early 1990s than in the late 1 960s/early 1 970s,

Panel 0 graphs fixed-weighted averages of femalelmale log wage ratios for six five year

age groups covering workers aged 20 to 49 years. The different patterns of educational
attainment of men and women in Japan have led us to not adjust for educational attainment in

making these comparisons. The figure shows a fairly substantial narrowing of the gender
earnings gap among regular workers from 1976 to 1988.

Thus changes in education and gender wage differentials in Japan in the 1 980s are
qualitatively similar but much smaller in magnitude than the analogous changes in the United
States.

In Japan, education differentials increased slightly overall and moderately for new

entrants. The bigger increase in educational differentials for young workers is similar to the U.S.

pattern. The reversal of a pattern of rising experience differentials to a pattern of shrinking

experience differentials by the late 1 980s is more extreme in Japan in the United States.
Unfortunately, we do not have data on wage distributions within sex-age-education cells to look

at within-group inequality measures in Japan that are similar to those we can compute for our

15
other countries.

0. Changes in the Structure of Wanes in France

French data on mean wages by gender, occupation, industry and age come from the
Declarations Annuelles de Salaires DAS), which contains data for full-time workers in all private

and semi-public firms. While labor income is measured on an annual basis, it is constructed on

the basis of a fixed number of hours so that it has a straightforward transformation into an
hourly wage measure. The data have been collected annually for many years, but were available

in published form from 1976-1987. No data collection took place in 1981 or 1983, so these
years are missing from the time series. While detailed occupational data are available in the
DAS, there was a significant occupational redefinition beginning in 1984 that makes detailed

comparisons problematic. Aggregating occupations into nonmanual and manual categories
eliminates nearly all of the incompatibilities.

Data on wage distributions by sex and by sex-occupation groups for the 1967-82 and
1984-87 periods are available from two analogous data sets from the DAS. These data sets
cover all full-time workers in private and semi-public firms born in October of even numbered
years--roughly 4 percent samples of the covered working population.
Figure 6 summarizes between group changes in the French wage structure for the 1976-

87 period and within-occupation changes for the 1967-87 period. Panel A shows movements
in the nonmanual/manual differential by sex. The figure graphs fixed-weighted averages of the

differences in the log of the mean hourly wages of nonmanual and manual workers in 8 age

groups for each sex." The nonmanual/manual differential narrows from the mid 1970s
through the mid 1 98cm, with a minor uptick at the end of the sample period. This contrasts with

the British experience of a sharply rising nonrnanuat wage premium throughout the 1980s. But

16The age groups are 21-25, 26-30, 31-35, 36-40, 41-45, 46-50, 51-55, and 56-60. The fixedweights are the average employment shares of each age group over the sample.

panel B of figure 6 shows that the experience differentials for males in France increased in a
quite similar fashion to the analogous measure for British males (shown in panel B of figure 4).
Female/male log wage differentials by broad occupation (measured by fixed-weighted averages

of the male/female log hourly wage ratio for eight age groups) show a narrowing in France of
0.08 for manual and 0.09 for nonmanual workers from 1976 to 1987. Finally, panel D indicates

that within-occupation wage dispersion narrowed substantially for males from the late 1 960s

to 1980.

In the 1980s, within-occupation inequality measured by the 90-10 log wage

differential expanded for professional and managerial occupations (e.g. cadres superiores) and

narrowed for manual occupations (e.g. ouvriers).

E. Differences and Similarities in Wace Structure Chanoes

The qualitative features of wage structure changes over the last twenty years in the
United States, Great Britain, France, and Japan are summarized and compared in Table 3. All
four countries shared in the common OECD pattern of declining educational and occupational

wage differentials in the 1 970s. The pattern of narrowing skill differentials reversed itself in

three of the countries by the early 1 980s and in France starting in 1984. The magnitude of
increases in skill differentials in the 1980s are largest in Britain and the United States.'7

More generally Britain and the United States show quite similar patterns of substantial
increases in between and within group wage inequality in the 1 980s. The one exception to this
pattern is that experience differentials for more-educated workers narrowed in the United States
in the 1 960s. Japan had moderate increases in inequality in the 1 980s. and France is the outlier

"Differences in education systems mean the best way to compare the magnitude of skill differential
changes in France, Britain and the United States is to examine changes in analogous occupational wage
differentials. Table A2 of the Appendix compares changes in nonmanual/manual wage differentials by
age-sex groups in Britain, France, and the United States using as comparable as possible earnings data

and occupational classification systems. Differences in the organization of work and similarities in
educational distributions for males mean that educational earnings differentials are more comparable
in the United States and Japan than are occupational wage differentials. Katz and Revenga (1989)
compare changes in college/high school wage differentials in Japan and the United States.

with no rise in inequality through 1984. Increased wage inequality in France from 1984 to 1987
suggests wage structure changes similar to those experienced by the other countries in the early

1 980s may be occurring with a lag in France. U.S. males are the only group for whom overall

wage inequality was already increasing in the 1 970s. France and Britain share a pattern of
decreasing wage dispersion in the 1 970s. Finally, the relative earnings of females improved in
all four countries over the last twenty years, although the time patterns of the changes are fairly
heterogeneous.

IV. SupiDly and Demand Factors

We begin our investigation into the causes of the between-group relative wage changes

documented in the previous section using a simple supply and demand framework in which
different demographic groups (identified by sex, age, and education) are viewed of as distinct
labor inputs. We initially abstract from the effects of labor market institutions on wage setting
and think of the relative wages of demographic groups in each country as being generated by

the interaction of relative supplies of the groups and an aggregate production function with its

associated factor demand schedules. To the extent that different demographic groups are
imperfect substitutes in production, we can view changes in relative wages as being generated
by shifts in relative numbers of workers in each group and shifts in relative demand schedules.

Changes in the age structure and educational attainment of the population as well as changes

in female labor force participation rates may affect the wage structure by altering the relative

supplies of imperfectly substitutable groups of workers. Shifts in the structure of product
demand and skill-biased technological change are likely to affect relative labor demands. In this

section, we examine the extent to which changes in the relative numbers of workers by
education and changes in relative demands associated with industry shifts in emp!oyment can
help explain cross-country differences in relative wage changes.

18

A. Relative SuoDly Changes

Much research on the U.S. wage structure concludes that substantial secular growth in

the demand for "more-educated" and "more-skilled" workers is necessary to rationalize the
persistence of substantial educational wage differentials in the face of a rapid growth in the
fraction of highly educated workers in the U.S. labor force (e.g. Bound and Johnson. 1992; and

Murphy and Welch, 1992). Freeman (1981) argues that trend growth in the relative demand
for college-educated workers is required to explain patterns of changes in the relative wages and

quantities in most OECD economies through the end of the 1 970s. Under the stark hypothesis

that the relative demand for college graduates grows at a relatively steady trend rate (perhaps

because of a steady pace of industrial shifts and technological changes favoring the moreskilled), changes in the college wage premium should be inversely related to changes in the rate

of growth of the relative supply of college graduates. Katz and Murphy (1992) find that a simple

hypothesis of this type does a good job explaining movements in U.S. educational wage
differentials over the last thirty years. This approach suggests that differences in the rate of
growth of the supply of highly educated workers in the 1 970s and the 1 980s may help explain

a fairly general pat-tern of narrowing education differentials in the 1 970s and expanding
differentials in the 1 980s.

Table 4 provides summary information on changes in the fraction of the labor force (or
adult population) with college educations in the United States, Britain, France and Japan over
the last two decades. The rate of growth of college-educated workers was quite rapid in all four

countries in the 1 970s. The expansion of the availability of higher education and large baby•

boom cohorts fueled the furious pace of relative supply growth over this period. The rate of
growth of the relative supply of highly-educated workers decelerated substantially in the United
States. Britain, and Japan in the 1 980s. The relative earnings of university graduates declined

in each of these countries during the 1 970s when supply growth was fastest and expanded in

each of these countries in the 1 980s when supply growth was much slower. Relative supply

workers. The estimates also indicate that the sharp contrast in the labor market performance
of less-educated young workers in Britain in the 1 970s and I 980s may be associated with its
particularly sharp acceleration in the pace of deindustrialization in the early 1 980s.

Since educational earnings differentials expanded and gender earnings differentials
narrowed in each of these countries in the 1 980s, the actual between-sector
demand shifts that

would have occurred at fixed relative factor prices are likely to be greater than those suggested
in Table 6- Additionally, the use of highly aggregate one-digit

industry categories is likely to lead

us to understate the magnitude of between-industry relative demand shifts. When we use two-

digit industry data for Japan and the United States, we find that relative demand shifts across
education-gender groups have a similar pattern to the one-digit estimates presented in Table 6
but are almost twice as large in magnitude.

In summary, simple supply and demand factors appear to go a reasonable difference

towards explaining differences in changes in the wage structure across time periods and
countries. A significant slowdown in the growth rate of the relative supply of college graduates
occurred in the United States, Britain, and Japan. This reduction in the pace of the growth of

the supply of highly educated workers combined with steady demand growth favoring such
workers provides a consistent explanation for declining education differentials in the 1 970s and

a rapid growth of education differentials in the 1 980s in Britain and the United States. An
acceleration in the pace of between- and within-industry demand shifts also appears in these two

countries with massive increases in wage inequality in the 1 980s. France's stable skill
differentials may relate to a continuation of a rapid growth of the relative supply of highlyeducated workers in the 1 980s. Nevertheless, the much earlier appearance of rising inequality

in the United States than the other three countries and the extent to which France's wage
structure behaved differently than the others in the 1 980s do suggest that differences in labor

market institutions may play a major role in explaining differential responses of national wage
structures to common relative skill demand shifts.

19
growth slowed down in the 1 980s in these three countries both when measured as the annual
average change in the log share of college graduates and when measured aà the annual average

change in the percentage share of college graduates.

Under the assumption that the elasticity of substitution between college and non-college

workers in the United States is in Freeman's (1986) preferred 1-3 range, the slowdown in the

rate of growth of college graduates in the United States from the 1 970s to the 1 980s can
explain an increase in the college/high school log wage differential from 1979 to 1989 of 0.06

to 0.20. In fact, the U.S. college/high school log wage ratio for all males (panel A of figure 3)

increased by 0-14 from 1979 to 1989. If the degree of substitutability of college and other

workers is at the low end of existing estimates, then changes In the rate of growth of the
relative supply of college workers in the 1 980s are sufficient by themselves to explain observed

increases in the college wage premium in the United States. Britain, and Japan. Thus
differences in the rate of growth of the relative supply of highly educated workers in the 1 970s

and 1 980s may be an important part of the explanation for declining skill differentials in the
1 970s and rising skill differentials in the 1 980s.
Table 4 further indicates that the one country in which education/occupation differentials

do not appear to have expanded in the 1 980s, France, is also the country in which the log
relative supply growth of college graduates remained the greatest in the 1 980s. The evidence
for a deceleration in log relative supply growth in France in the 1 980s is somewhat ambiguous.

One gets different answers for choices of slightly different years and different samples (e.g. the
adult population versus the adult labor force).

B. Relative Demand Shifts

It is clear that substantial shifts in relative demand favoring more-educated and moreskilled workers are necessary to explain patterns of changes in wage structures in most OECD

countries over the post-war period. One explanation for patterns of changes in education/skill

20
differentials is that relative demand for more-educated workers has grown fairly steadily and that

variations in changes in skill differentials across periods are driven by changes in the rate of
growth of relative supply. This explanation is fairly consistent with the observed time-series for
the United States under the assumption of fairly low substitutability between college and lesseducated workers. But the 1 980s deceleration in therate of growth of relative supply of college

graduates is many countries is not a sufficient explanation for the observed increases in
educational wage differentials if the degree of substitutability is in the high range of plausible
estimates. Furthermore, sharp increases in experience differentials for less-educated workers
in the early 1980s, a period of small entering cohorts of less-educated workers, do not seem to

fit into a picture of smooth changes in relative skill demands throughout the last twenty years.

An alternative set of explanations focuses on an acceleration in the rate of growth of relative

demand for more-skilled workers possibly arising from an increased pace of technological
changes, foreign outsourcing of production jobs, or the decline of the manufacturing sector.
We find it useful to think of relative demand shifts as coming from two types of changes:

those that occur within industries (i.e., shifts that change relative factor ratios at fixed relative
factor prices) and those that occur between industries (i.e.. shifts that change the allocation of
labor demand across industries at fixed relative wages). Sources of within-industry shifts include
skill-biased technological change, outsourcing, and changes in the prices of nonlabor inputs (e.g.

computers). Between-industry shifts may be driven by shifts in product demand across
industries, differences across industries in factor-neutral technological change, and shifts in net
international trade.

The finding that the share of employment of college graduates and women increased
inside almost every two-digit industry in the United States from 1963-87 despite increases in
the relative prices of college graduates and females suggests important shifts in relative demand

have occurred within detailed industries (Katz and Murphy, 1992). These changes in relative
demand for more-educated and nonproduction workers appear to have accelerated in the 1 980s

21

(Berman, Bound, and Griliches, 1992). Similar changes in factor ratios within one-digit industries

are apparent in our examination of British data from the Labour Force Survey for the 1980s.
Thus an increased pace of within-sector skill upgrading in a period of rising relative prices of
more-skilled workers suggests that an acceleration in within-industry relative demand growth
plays some role in rising wage inequality in the 1 980s.

The effects of between-industry shifts in labor demand on the relative demands for
different skill and demographic groups depends on group differences in Industrial employment

distributions. Shifts in industrial employment will shift relative labor demands if sectors differ
in their intensity of use of different types of workers. The data we have available for the United
States, Britain4 and Japan all indicate that input coefficients for different education groups and
for men and women differ systematically across industries in a similar manner in each country.

Less-educated workers are over-represented in agriculture, construction, mining, and many

manufacturing sectors. College graduates are over-represented in professional and related
services, finance, insurance and real estate, and some high technology manufacturing sectors.

Major industrial employment shifts in each country are illustrated in Table 5. France, the

United Kingdom, and the United States all experienced a sharp decline in the share of
employment in goods-producing industries (mining, manufacturing, construction, and utilities)
in the 1970s and the 1 980s. These employment shifts are likely to have led to a shift in relative

demand against less-skilled workers. The relative decline of employment in goods-producing

industries over the entire period was comparable in the United States and France, but was
significantly larger in the United Kingdom. Japan is an outlier in the other direction: it maintained

a stable share of employment in manufacturing throughout the 1970s and 1980s. The shifts
illustrated in Table 5 suggest an acceleration in the pace of between-industry demand shifts
against the less-skilled in the 1 980s in Britain and France. The broad changes in the industrial

distribution of employment in each of the four countries also are likely to have favored women
over men.

We next attempt to more systematically determine whether changes in the industrial
composition of employment led to an acceleration in the rate of decline in relative demand for
less-educated workers in the 1 980s. We use standard fixed-coefficient relative demand shift
indices to measure how changes in the industrial mix of jobs in the United States, Britain, and
Japan have affected the relative demand for workers by sex-education categories in the I 970s

and in the I 980s. We specify an index of the demand for the labor of the jth group of workers
in year t as

(1)

where

=

is total empcyment in industry i in year t and ; is the fixed coefficient relating the

number of workers in group j to total employment in industry i under fixed technology and fixed
relative factor prices. Since we are concerned with changes in relative demands, we normalize

both sides of equation (1) by dividing through by aggregate employment at time t CEjto yield
the index of the relative demand for group j given by

(2)

e=ae

where e, = E1,/E, and e = E,iE1. We measure the log change in the relative demand for group
as Aln(ej. This approach to measuring relative demand shifts arising from sectoral employment

shifts can either be justified as a fixed-coefficients "manpower requirementC index (Freeman.

1986) or as an approximation to "true" factor demand shifts for more general production
functions (Katz and Murphy, 1 992).

To implement this approach to measuring demand shifts in as comparable a manner as

possible in different countries, we divide the economies of each country into nine one-digit
industries and divide the labor forces into six to eight sex-education grOups. We use separate

23

estimates of the c,'s for each country. We measure 0q as group i's share of total employment

in sector i in a base period. We measure changes in industrial employment

shares (changes

in e,1's) for each country on a comparable basis using the one-digit industrial employment
distributions reported by the OECD (OECD, 1991). Although important industrial shifts

occurring

within one-digit industries are missed by our measure of between-industry demand shifts, this

approach does provide a way to gauge differences across countries and time periods in the

extent that broad changes in industry mix have affected the relative demands for different
groups of workers.

Table 6 presents changes in our relative demand shift measures over the 1969-79 and
1979-99 periods for eight demographic groups in the United States and six demographic groups
in Britain and Japan.1' Measured between-industry demand shifts are

monotonically increasing

for both men and women in all three countries in both time periods. Between-industry shifts also

favored women relative to men in every education group for all three countries. The magnitude
of demand shifts against less-educated workers increased in Britain in the 1980s, appears fairly
steady across the two decades in the United States, and decreases in Japan in the 1980s. The

large magnitude of the relative demand shifts in Japan in the 1 970s are driven by the sharp
decline in agriculture's share of employment. Japan's strength in manufacturing in the 1980s

meant a smaller between-industry shift in relative labor demand against high school (upper
secondary) males in Japan than in Britain or the United States. Overall the between-industry
shifts are consistent with a pattern of trend increases in the relative demand for highly-educated

"The base period in each country was chosen so that the ui's would reflect average production
technologies in the 1 980s. The base years for each country are 1979, 1984, and 1989 for the United
States; 1 979, 1983, 1987, and 1989 for Britain; and 1979 and 1987 for Japan. Experimentation with
U.S. data indicate that estimated shifts in relative labor demands are not very sensitive to the choice
of base year over the 1967 to 1989 period. The cd's were calculated using data on employment

status, industry, education, and sex from household surveys in each country: the CI'S Outgoing
Rotation Groups in the United States; the Labour Force Survey for Britain; and the Employment Status
Survey for Japan.

19Unfortunately we do not have the necessary data to calculate analogous measures for France.

workers. The estimates also indicate that the sharp contrast in the labor market performance

digit industry data for Japan and the United States, we find that relative demand shifts across
education-gender groups have a similar pattern to the one-digit estimates presented in Table 6
but are almost twice as large in magnitude.

In summary, simple supply and demand factors appear to go a reasonable difference

towards explaining differences in changes in the wage structure across time periods and
countries. A significant slowdown in the growth rate of the relative supply of college graduates
occurred in the United States, Britain, and Japan. This reduction in the pace of the growth of

the supply of highly educated workers combined with steady demand growth favoring such
workers provides a consistent explanation for declining education differentials in the 1 970s and

a rapid growth of education differentials in the 1 980s in Britain and the United States. An
acceleration in the pace of between- and within-industry demand shifts also appears in these two

countries with massive increases in wage inequality in the 1 980s. France's stable skill
differentials may relate to a continuation of a rapid growth of the relative supply of highlyeducated workers in the 1 980s. Nevertheless, the much earlier appearance of rising inequality

in the United States than the other three countries and the extent to which France's wage
structure behaved differently than the others in the 1 980s do suggest that differences in labor

market institutions may play a major role in explaining differential responses of national wage
structures to common relative skill demand shifts.

25
V. The Role of Labor Market Institutions

The much different behavior of the pattern of relative wages in France than in the other

three countries in the 1 980s in a period of substantial industrial employment shifts in France
does point to the possibility that French labor market institutions somewhat offset the effects
of relative demand shifts on skill differentials. The outstanding features of the French wage data

are that differentials across occupational groups failed to increase substantially in the 1 980s,

wage inequality did not increase significantly overall or within most groups, and real incomes
grew substantially, particularly for manual workers.
There are two important and inter-related labor market institutions that may help explain

why relative demand shifts led to only quite modest relative wage changes in France: the
collective bargaining system and the minimum wage. Collective bargaining in France has taken

place mainly at the industry level since 1 950, when a law was passed favoring industry-level
bargaining between national employers' federations and national unions. Accordingly, the four
large unions in France, and a few smarler ones, are organized on an industry basis. There are
no majority representation criteria as in the United States. The French unions have authority to
bargain collectively on behalf of the employees in an industry, even though only a small portion

of the employees are members of any particular union. Under the terms of the law, industrylevel agreements may be extended by the Minister of Labor to all firms in the industry even those

that are not members of the employers' federation.

French workers are not obliged to join unions to receive the benefits of negotiated
agreements. Since dues are collected on an individual basis and are not deducted automatically
by the employer, membership statistics are poor, and the unions must make estimates based on

total dues revenues. Nonetheless, it is clear that union density has fallen significantly, from
roughly 24 percent in the 1 970s to less than 15 percent in the late 1 980s. The membership of

the most militant union, Confederation Generale du Travail, is estimated to have dropped by

more that 60 percent from 1976 to 1987 (Bridgford, 1990).

26

The membership figures, however, do not accurately portray union influence. Support for
the unions is better measured by their candidates' success in elections for positions on industrial

tribunals and enterprise committees.2° While the percentage of votes cast for union candidates

has declined since the 1970s, Bridgford (1990) reports that they still receive nearly fifty percent

of the votes for industrial tribunals and nearly eighty percent of the votes for enterprise
committees. Moreover, industry-level agreements negotiated by the unions and employer
federations are routinely extended to all firms in the industry, so that unions exert significant

influence on the terms and conditions of employment throughout most industries. Data from
1981 show that nearly eighty percent of all firms, and nearly ninety percent of all workers were

covered by industry-level agreements (Eyraud and Tchobanian, 1985; and Cairo, 1984). The
industry-level agreements determine minimum wages for each job category. Companies may,
and often do, chose to pay more, especially for the more highly skilled jobs, but the negotiated

minima represent a constraint that applies to firms of all sizes throughout an industry.2'
The second key labor market institution is the legislated minimum wage, or SMIC (salaire

minimum interprofessional de croissance). The SMIC, which applies to essentially all sectors
with few exemptions or abatements, is a very considerable constraint on the wages of the young

or less-skilled, Begun in 1950 when wartime wage controls were lifted, the 5Mb is adjusted
automatically for inflation, and occasionally changed in real terms by the federal government.
Indeed, the legislation enacting the SMIC referred to it not as a subsistence wage, but rather as

a social policy tool intended to help poorly paid workers share in economic growth (OECD,
1985). Brazen and Martin (1991) estimate that 12 percent of all wage and salary earners were

paid at or below the SMIC in 1 987 and that this percentage had risen significantly since the

I 970s. Only about 5 percent of all U.S. wage and salary workers were paid at or below the

20lndustrial tribunals hear claims of unjust and illegal actions by employers against employees.
Enterprise committees are responsible for social activities and labor-management consultation.
21hence, large firms typically cannot significantly reduce labor costs by sub-contracting to small
producers,

27

Federal minimum wage of ($3.35 per hour) or less in 1988, and this fraction had declined
significantly since 1981 (Haugen and MelIor, 1990). The SMIC has been at least 60% of the
mean wage since 1978, and has actually increased significantly since then in terms of the mean

wage (Katz and Loveman, 1990). Figure 7 shows that the SMIC has also increased relative to
wages for unskilled workers for the past twenty years. The increase was most dramatic in the

early 1 980s, when wage differentials were rising sharply in the United States and Britain and

starting to rise in Japan. An especially sharp rise in the SMIC in the early 1980s followed the
election of the Socialists in 1981. The Socialist government pursued an economic policy that
featured increases in the SMIC as a means of increasing purchasing power for lower income
workers. From July 1 980s to July 1984, the government increased the SMIC in real terms by
14 percent, while average real hourly wages rose by just over 6 percent.
These substantial relative increases in the SMIC tightened wage differentials at the lower

end of the distribution. We estimate using our data on French earnings distributions from the

DAS that from 1979 to 1987 the SMIC increased from 45.7 to 53.3 percent of the median
earnings and from 73.3 to 84.4 percent of the tenth percentile earnings of full-time French male

employees. In fact, from 1967 to 1987, the SMIC increased from 75 to 101 percent of the
10th percentile hourly earnings of full-time female workers in the DAS sample. In contrast, the
U.S. Federal minimum wage remained fixed at a nominal value of $3.35 per hour from 1981 to

1990 and declined in real and relative value throughout the 1 980s. We use our March CPS
wage samples to estimate that the U.S. minimum wage declined over the 1979 to 1987 period

from 40.1 to 30.3 percent of the median and from 82.3 to 69.7 percent of the tenth percentile

hourly wage of male, full-time employees in the United States. The SMIC appears to have
helped prevent a sharp erosion of real wages at the low end of the French wage distribution.

When the SMIC does not bind on the wages of the less-skilled, the industry-negotiated

minima do. In some industries the base (minimum) wage is set equal to the SMIC, while in
others, such as metal working, it is set as a multiple of the SMIC. In either case, changes in the

SMIC shift the entire wage distribution. The potential influence of unions and the SMIC on
wages in the lower half of the French earnings distribution is highlighted in Table 7 which shows

three measures of overall wage inequality for our four countries for selected years from 1979

to 1989. The table indicates that the bottom half of the French wage distribution for men (as

measured by the log wage gap between the 50th and 10th percentiles) is much more
compressed relative to the top half (as measured by the log wage gap between the 90th and

50th percentiles) than in the other three countries. The 50-10 differential narrowed a bit for
both French men and women in the period of the rapid rise in the value of the SNUG from 1979

to 1 984, while the 50-10 gap was rising for both sexes in the United States and Britain and for
men in Japan.

While negotiated and legislated minima have maintained the relative wages of the less
skilled with jobs, the employment prospects for young, less-skilled people deteriorated sharply.
In 1984, youth unemployment in France was 26 percent, compared to 15 percent in the seven
major industrial OECD countries. Likewise, the duration of unemployment in France was much

longer than in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States.22 While one must be
cautious in drawing conclusions concerning the effects of the SMIC on the employment of youth

and the less-skilled from simple time series patterns, Brazen and Martin (1991) provide some
(weak) evidence suggestive of moderate adverse effects of the SMIC on youth employment in
France in the early 1 980s.

The DAS wage data suggest that there may have been a slight increase in French wage

inequality, both within and between groups, since 1984. The Auroux reforms in 1982 began
a process of change in French industrial relations that favors enterprise or plant-level negotiations

over industry-wide negotiations. The reforms require unions and firms to negotiate wages and

other matters annually, but they do not require the completion of an agreement. As this
legislation matured during the 1 980s, negotiations over substantive issues, including wages,
"See OECD (1985).

Notes: 90/10 refers to the log wage differential between the 90th and 10th
percentile workers. The 90/50 and 50/10 differentials are defined analogous—
ly.
The wage inequality measures refer to log hourly wages for the U.S.,
Great Britain and France, and to log monthly scheduled wages for Japan.

have become increasingly decentralized, but agreements remain largely at the industry level.

These changes have moved France closer to the U.S. model of low union membership and

decentralized negotiations, and may have played a role in the modest increases in wage
inequality since the mid 1 980s.

VI. Conclusion
This paper has examined similarities and differences in patterns of changes in the structure

of wages in the United States, Britain, Japan and France over the last twenty years. Educational

and occupational wage differentials narrowed in all four countries in the 1 970s. This pattern
reversed itself with increases in skill differentials in the United States, Britain, and Japan in the
early 1 980s and a muted but somewhat similar pattern appears to emerge in France starting in

1984.

Reductions in the rate of the growth of the relative supply of college-educated workers
in the face of persistent increases in the relative demand for more-skilled labor can explain a
substantial portion of the increase in educational wage differentials in the United States. Britain,

and Japan in the 1 980s. The earlier appearance of rising overall wage inequality in the United

States than in Britain may reflect the power of British unions to oppose the apparently marketdriven forces that contributed to rising overall wage inequality among males in the United States
in the 1 970s. The more severe increases in skill differentials in Britain and the United States than

in Japan can be partially attributed to an acceleration in the rate of growth of the demand for

more-skilled workers in the 1 980s associated with industrial employment shifts out of
manufacturing and within sector skill upgrading. Similar changes in relative skill demands are
likely to have occurred in France, but the effect of such changes on wages has been somewhat

offset by a high minimum wage and the ability of French unions to extend contracts even in the
face of declining membership.

Data Appendix
UNITED STATES
Data Source I: Annual Demographic Files, March Current Population Survey (CI'S), 1964-

90.

Earnings Concept: Hourly wage Cannual earnings divided by annual hours) in the year prior
to the survey. Annual hours are given by the product of annual weeks worked and usual weekly
hours.
Wage Sample: Full-time workers, 18-64 years old. The wage sample excludes those in
the military, students, agricultural workers, without-pay workers, those that worked less than

13 weeks in the previous year, wage-salary workers with self-employment income, the
unincorporated self-employed, and those with allocated income.
Quantity Sample for Measuring Weeks Worked by Different Groups: Excludes those in
military, students, agricultural workers, and without-pay workers.
Remarks: Adjustments for top coding, bracketed weeks and hours variables, changes in

the CPS imputation procedures in 1976 are as in Murphy and Welch (1992).

Potential
experience is measured as age at the survey date minus years of completed schooling minus 7.

Data Source II: Outgoing Rotation Groups, CPS, all twelve months, 1979-91.
Earnings Concept: Hourly wage (usual weekly earnings divided by usual weekly hours) at
current jobWage Sample: Full-time workers, 18-64 years old. Excludes the self-employed, workers
with allocated (imputed) earnings, and those with reported hourly wages of less than $2.00 or
more than $100.00 in 1991 dollars.
Remarks: Top coded earnings are adjusted upward by a multiplicative factor of 1.36.
Earnings from the unedited usual weekly earnings fields with a higher nominal top code are used
to measure weekly earnings for workers with top coded edited earnings in the 1986-88 surveys.
GREAT BRITAIN

Data Source I: New Earnings Survey (NES), published volumes for 1968 and 1970-91.
Earnings Concept: Gross hourly earnings.
Wage Sample: Full-time employees, 21 or older for males and 18 or older for females,
whose pay was not affected by absence during the survey period.
Remarks: The NES is a sample survey of the earnings of employees in employment in
Great Britain in April of each year. It covers a one-percent random sample of employees who
are members of pay-as-you-earn income tax schemes, and is designed to represent all categories
of employees in businesses of all kinds and sizes.

Data Source /1: General Household Survey (GHS), 1973-90.
Earnings Concept: Gross weekly earnings.
Wage Sample: Full-time employees, 16-69 years old.
Remark: A CPS-style household survey of 10 to 15 thousand households per year.

Data Source Ill: Labour Force Surveys (LFS), 1979-1990.
Earnings Concept: No earnings information is collected.
Remark: A large CPS-style household survey that does not collect wage information but
is quite useful for the measurement of relative quantities of different types of workers in total
employment and by industry.

33
JAPAN
Data Source I: Basic Survey on Wage Structure, published tabulations, 1967-90.
Earnings Concept: Monthly scheduled earnings.
Wage Sample: Regular workers, 1 8-59 years old, at non-governmental establishments with

at least 5-10 regular workers (varies by survey year). Excludes agriculture, forestry and
fisheries, private household services and employees of foreign governments.
Remarks: 70,000 to 100,000 establishments are surveyed in a typical year. The sample
excluded the service sector prior to 1973.

Data Source II: Employment Status Survey, published tabulations, 1971-1987.
Earnings Concept: A continuous individual earnings measure is not available.

Remark: A large national household survey that is useful for measuring quantities. It
covers a broader spectrum of workers than does the Basic Survey on Wage Structure.
FRANCE

Data Source: Tabulations from the Declarations Annuelles de Salaires (DAS).
Earnings Concept: Gross annual earnings adjusted for differences among individuals in
annual hours worked.
Wage Sample: Full-time, full-year workers in private and semi-public firms.
