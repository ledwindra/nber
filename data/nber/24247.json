    "abstract": "\n\nWhile health affects economic development and wellbeing through a variety of pathways, one commonly suggested mechanism is a \"horizon\" channel in which increased longevity induces additional education. A recent literature devotes much attention to how much education responds to increasing longevity, while this study asks instead what impact this specific channel has on wellbeing (welfare).  I note that death is like a tax on human-capital investments, which suggests the use of a standard public-economics tool: triangles.  I construct estimates of the triangle gain if education adjusts to lower adult mortality.  Even for implausibly large responses of education to survival  differences, almost all of today's low-human-development countries, if switched instantaneously to Japan's survival curve, would place a value on this channel of less than 15% of income.  Calibrating the model with well-identified micro- and cohort-level studies, I find that the horizon triangle for the typical low-income country is instead less than a percent of lifetime income.  Gains from increased survival in the 20th-century are similarly sized.\n\n",
