ABSTRACT
We study the evolution of market-oriented policies over time and across countries. We consider a
model in which own and neighbors' past experiences influence policy choices, through their effect
on policymakers' beliefs. We estimate the model using a large panel of countries. We find that there
is a strong geographical component to learning, which is crucial to explain the slow adoption of liberal
policies during the postwar period. Our model also predicts that there would be a substantial reversal
to state intervention if nowadays the world was hit by a shock of the size of the Great Depression.

Abstract. We study the evolution of market-oriented policies over time and across
countries. We consider a model in which own and neighbors’past experiences in‡uence
policy choices, through their e¤ect on policymakers’ beliefs. We estimate the model
using a large panel of countries. We …nd that there is a strong geographical component
to learning, which is crucial to explain the slow adoption of liberal policies during the
postwar period. Our model also predicts that there would be a substantial reversal to
state intervention if nowadays the world was hit by a shock of the size of the Great
Depression.

1. Introduction
This paper studies the dynamics of economic policies across countries and over time.
We focus on one important aspect of a government’s economic policy decision, namely
whether to be interventionist or instead favor a market-based allocation of resources.
These issues are obviously crucial to the debate on growth and economic development.
At the same time, there exist widely di¤erent views around the world about the relative
bene…ts of the markets versus the state. Moreover, history shows that countries undergo
cycles of liberalizations and reversals to state intervention, and viceversa. Our goal is
understanding these transitions across regimes.
We explore one speci…c mechanism driving countries’ transitions between regimes of
state intervention and market orientation. This mechanism relies on the evolution of policymakers’beliefs about the desirability of free markets. We argue that these beliefs change
because policymakers learn from their own past experience, as well as the experience of
other countries.

The notion that past experience shapes beliefs and policy decisions is well rooted in
policy circles. For instance, Stanley Fischer suggests the rise of socialist ideas in the 20th
century as a clear case of interaction of outcomes, ideas and policies:
“It is not hard to see why views on the role of the state changed between
1914 and 1945 [...] A clear-headed look at the evidence of the last few
decades at that point should have led most people to view the market
model with suspicion, and a large role for the state with approbation- and
it did.” [Fischer (1995), p. 102]
In a similar vein, the dismantlement of these ideas was a consequence of the change in
views that “resulted from a combination and interaction of research and experience with
development and development policy.”(Krueger (1997)) An important witness of this era
also attests to this fact:
“I remember the foreign minister and the …nance minister from another
country saying to me: ‘You’re the …rst prime minister who is ever tried
to roll back the frontiers of socialism. We want to know what’s going to
happen. Because if you succeed others will follow.’”[Margaret Thatcher in
Cran (2002)]
Despite this crucial connection between ideas, policies and economic development, there
are very few formal treatments of these mechanisms in the literature. This paper …lls this
gap by proposing and estimating a model of the evolution of beliefs and policies where
these interactions are at play.
In our model, countries start o¤ with some prior beliefs about the e¤ects of state
intervention and market orientation on economic growth. Policymakers choose a regime
of market orientation if they think that it is growth enhancing, and if the political costs
entailed by this regime are not too large. However, the arrival of new information forces
policymakers to revise their beliefs over time, which might lead to changes in policies. In
updating their beliefs, policymakers pay also attention to the experience of other countries.
However, they are allowed to discount the information coming from countries that are
geographically, culturally or economically distant from the home country. In our model, it
is optimal to do so if the e¤ects of alternative policies are perceived to be country speci…c.

We estimate the parameters of the model (prior beliefs, structure of learning and the
distribution of political costs) adopting data on the market orientation and GDP growth
for a panel of 133 countries, over the years 1950-2001. We discipline our estimation procedure by imposing that countries’prior beliefs must be consistent with the data available
for the 1900-1950 period.
We …nd that our simple learning mechanism rationalizes the evolution of marketoriented policies, correctly predicting 93% of the policy choices observed in the data and
60% of the policy changes within an interval of

3 years. In particular, the model captures

well the early reversals towards state intervention typical of regions like Latin America,
and the heterogeneous timing of liberalizations. To build intuition, it is useful to explain
why, according to the model, many countries became market-oriented in the 1980s and
1990s. This is due to the growth slow-down of late 1970s and 1980s. At that time, most
countries were state interventionists, and hence expectations about the bene…ts of state
intervention must have been downgraded due to the low –and even negative– observed
growth. Moreover, market-oriented economies performed better during those years, which
must have further tilted beliefs in favor of market orientation.
We use the estimated model to answer several questions of interest. What are the main
features of the learning model that are needed to explain the data? For example, how
geographically localized is learning? How do cross-country information spillovers a¤ect
the di¤usion of market-oriented policies? How dispersed are beliefs about the bene…ts of
market-oriented policies by the end of our sample? How likely are policy reversals to state
intervention after large negative global shocks to growth?
Our estimation results indicate that there is a strong geographical component to learning. The weight assigned to the experience of other countries declines by approximately
40% for every 1000Km (621.37 miles) of physical distance between countries. This turns
out to be quite important since the median country has only four countries within a radius
of 1000Km. Economic and cultural distance also matter in determining the relevant information neighborhood. More generally, according to our estimates, the localized nature
of learning is essential to understand the slow adoption of free market doctrines around
the world.
The localization of learning is also responsible for the substantial dispersion of countries’
beliefs by the end of the sample period. In fact, even if the available global evidence favors

4

market orientation as a strategy for development, there still exists a considerable number
of countries with negative views about the merits of market economies. Moreover, many
of those with a favorable view are either quite uncertain or believe that the gains are
quantitatively small. This motivates our concern that large growth shocks might induce
a sequence of policy reversals to interventionism. Our concern is warranted: our model
predicts that between 10% and 15% of the countries would revert to state intervention
within 5 years, following a world-wide shock of the size of the Great Depression. Our
exercises indicate that the evolution of beliefs is a central ingredient for the dynamics of
policies.

Our paper relates to a large literature that studies the determinants of policy decisions.
This literature mainly explores political economy dimensions, like redistributional issues,
interest-group politics, the role of multilateral institutions (see, for example, Grossman
and Helpman (1995), Krusell and Rios-Rull (1996) or Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson
(2005)). Our paper complements this literature by studying the formation and evolution
of beliefs about the bene…ts of di¤erent policies, as advocated by Kremer, Onatski, and
Stock (2001). In this respect, our work is more closely related to Piketty (1995), Mukand
and Rodrik (2005) and Strulovici (2008), where policy choices are related to the behavior of rational agents learning from past experience. Our focus, however, is on a formal
exploration of the quantitative role played by the evolution of beliefs for the policy outcomes observed in the data. To this end, we purposely abstract from the political economy
aspects, concentrating on tractable models of beliefs formation.
Models of policymakers as learning agents have been successfully applied to explain
the rise and fall of US in‡ation (see, for instance, Sargent (1999), Cogley and Sargent
(2005), Primiceri (2006) and Sargent, Williams, and Zha (2006)). Di¤erently from this
literature, policymakers in our model do not face a complex trade-o¤ between alternative
policy objectives. Our interest is instead in the role of learning spillovers among countries.
From this point of view, our paper is also related to the literature on social learning and
information spillovers in technology adoption and di¤usion (see, for instance, Besley and
Case (1994), Foster and Rosenzweig (1995) or Conley and Udry (2005)).
Finally, this paper draws from the empirical literature studying the behavior of countries income and growth (see, for instance, Jones (1997)) and their connection with trade

LEARNING THE WEALTH OF NATIONS

and market orientation policies (see Dollar (1992), Sachs and Warner (1995), Edwards
(1998) or Rodriguez and Rodrik (2000)). However, most of this literature investigates the
impact of policies on economic development, while our focus is exactly on the converse, i.e.
understanding the determinants of market-oriented policies. In this sense, our objective
is closer to Blattman, Clemens, and Williamson (2002), Clemens and Williamson (2004)
and, to a lesser extent, Sachs and Warner (1995), although none of these papers stresses
the importance of past growth performances for current policy choices.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our theoretical model.
Section 3 examines the dynamics and geography of market orientation and economic
growth during the postwar period. Section 4 describes the estimation methodology. The
estimation results and counterfactual exercises are discussed in sections 5 and 6 respectively. Section 7 contains some extensions and robustness checks and section 8 concludes.
2. Model
In this section we present a simple model in which the arrival of new information
continuously reshapes policymakers’beliefs and a¤ects policy decisions in each of the N
countries of the world economy. At each point in time, a country adopts market-oriented
policies if their perceived impact on growth overtakes their political and social cost.
2.1. The environment. In light of our available data, we simplify the economic policy
problem to a dichotomic choice, in which countries choose to either rely on markets or
state intervention. Policies are chosen period by period and we let

i;t

2 f0; 1g be an

indicator variable that equals 1 if country i choose to be a market-oriented economy in
period t and 0 otherwise.
Let Yi;t denote per-capita GDP in country i at time t and yi;t

From the perspective of policymakers (but not necessarily from ours), the relationship
between policy choices and GDP growth is given by equation (2.2), where

S
i

and

M
i

represent the average growth rates of country-i GDP under policies of state intervention
and market orientation respectively, and "i:s is a country speci…c shock.
Policy choices are also a¤ected by a random utility term Ki;t . The variable Ki;t is an
exogenous random variable that captures the present value of political and social costs of
market-oriented policies at time t. The constant

2
k;i

denotes the variance of these costs in

country i. The random political cost Ki;t is meant to capture variations in policies that are
n
oN
2
unexplained by our learning mechanism. In our estimation procedure, we treat
k;i
i=1

as a set of unknown parameters. Small estimates of

2
k;i

indicate that large variations in

exogenous political costs are not needed to rationalize the observed dynamics of policies
over time. In other words, we can interpret the estimates of

2
k;i

as a metric for the …t of

the model for country i.1
The information structure is as follows: policymakers do not know the value of
and

M
i .

S
i

However, for simplicity, we assume that they have perfect knowledge of all the

remaining model parameters, including the variance of the growth shock "i;s .
The timing of events is as follows: at the end of time t

1, policymakers in country

i observe data on policy choices and GDP growth of all N countries, and update their
beliefs about

S
i

and

M
i .

At the beginning of time t, they observe the realization of Ki;t

and decide what policy to adopt.

2.2. Optimal policy. We follow Sargent (1999) and assume that policymakers do not
intentionally experiment. In other words, once they update their beliefs, policymakers
solve the programming problem given by equations (2.1)-(2.4) as if these beliefs will not
change in the future.2 Given this assumption, optimal policy at time t is given by

1 Section 7 presents the results of an alternative model in which policies determine countries’ relative

income and the speed of convergence to the technological frontier (Barro and Sala-I-Martin (1995)). Section
7 also analyzes the case in which the level of the political cost depends on a country’s political environment
(measured by the Polity2 variable) and inherits its autocorrelation.
2 Therefore, expectations in (2.1) are taken with respect to the probability measure implied by this
assumption.

where 1 f g is the indicator function. Notice that the optimal policy decision only depends
on the expected average growth rates and not the entire distribution of beliefs: policymakers choose to pursue market-oriented policies if their expectation of the di¤erence
between average growth under this regime and a regime of state intervention overweights
the political cost.
By abstracting from voluntary experimentation we rule out the possibility of a country
opting for a policy regime perceived as detrimental for growth, but for which the country
does not have much information, with the sole purpose of learning about it. We rule out
experimentation for a number of reasons. First, while from a normative perspective experimenting might be bene…cial, ours is a positive study of the behavior of governments. The
extent to which governments conduct social experimentation on the grand scale remains
an open question. Economists like Lucas (1981) or Blinder (1998) have argued against
such behavior in policymaking. Moreover, standard voting schemes seem to reduce the
occurrence of collective experimentation (see Strulovici (2008)). Second, the gains from
experimentation are reduced in our setting because of two forces: (i) equations (2.1)-(2.4)
constitute a sequential statistical decision problem (see El-Gamal and Sundaram (1993)),
in which the presence of additional state variables (the political cost Ki;t ) circumvents the
incomplete learning results typical of the literature on multiarmed bandit problems (Berry
and Fristedt (1985)); (ii) in our multicountry learning setting, policymakers bene…t from
the variation in the political costs of other countries, which should lower the incentives
to experiment. Third and most important, the joint decision problem of N countries is
extremely hard to solve, because it involves strategic experimentation motives.3

2.3. Learning. We assume that, in period t = 0, policymakers of country i start o¤ with
a Gaussian prior density on the unknown coe¢ cients of (2.2), i.e.

Notice that we are making the simplifying assumption that the diagonal elements of the
covariance matrix are the same. This means that policymakers start with a similar degree of uncertainty about the e¤ects of government controls and market friendliness on
economic growth. The coe¢ cient

2
i

parameterizes this uncertainty.4

Priors are recursively updated with every new vintage of data. In updating their beliefs,
policymakers of country i might use data from other countries, depending on how useful
such data are perceived to be to learn about

i.

For example, if Argentinian policymakers

believe that the e¤ect of market-oriented policies in Argentina is fundamentally di¤erent
from the rest of the world, they will update their beliefs using only Argentinian data.
In the opposite extreme, if they believe that the growth e¤ect of market orientation is
approximately the same in the whole world, the data from every country will carry the
same weight as Argentina’s own data to update their beliefs. More plausibly, Argentinian
policymakers might view the experience of nearby countries such as Brazil, Chile and
Uruguay as informative, while discarding the data of more distant countries such as Japan,
Russia and Zimbabwe.
In order to capture this idea in a ‡exible and convenient way, we assume that policymakers of country i believe that the relationship between policy choices and growth in
other countries is described by the following equations:

4 Observe that we do not force countries to start o¤ with similar priors, in contrast with the literature
on common priors in games (see Morris (1995) for a review). In our time series environment with countryspeci…c signals, the common prior assumption is not a natural one.

LEARNING THE WEALTH OF NATIONS

where the subscript jji denotes country-i view about country-j variables.
Under this formulation, policymakers of country i believe that a relationship between
policy decisions and growth similar to (2.2) is in place also in country j.5 However, they
also believe that the average e¤ects of policies on growth in other countries might di¤er
from those in the home country. The variable qjji parameterizes these discrepancies, by
scaling the random di¤erences

S
j;s

and

M .6
j;s

In this way, qjji determines how useful data of

country j are for country i. For instance, if qjji = 0, the consequences of market-oriented
policies in country i and j are the same. Policymakers of country i would then use both
sources of data symmetrically to update beliefs. As qjji increases, data from country j
become less and less informative about the growth e¤ect of policy choices in country i.
We assume that qjji is a parametric function of a vector of covariates zji :
0
2 zji

qjji = exp

1.

We borrow this formulation from the literature on geographically weighted regressions
(Fotheringnam, Brunsdon, and Charlton (2002)). The vector zji may include various
measures of geographic, cultural or economic distance between country i and j. This
speci…cation captures the idea that policymakers might attach more weight to countries
that are closer geographically, culturally or economically to the home country.
Bayes law induces simple updating rules for ^ i;t

Ei;t [

S
i ;

M 0
i ]

, i.e. the expectation

of policymakers’ beliefs in country i about the average e¤ect of state intervention and
market orientation on growth. Appendix A derives these updating rules and shows that this
formulation of the problem is equivalent to a weighted least squares estimation problem,
in which policymakers of country i assign a weight
(2.11)

wjji =

i
j

0
exp zji

.

to data coming from country j.
Finally, notice that in our model the weight wjji is perfectly known to policymakers. An
interesting alternative would be to assume that policymakers do not have perfect knowledge of the coe¢ cients f i gN
i=1 and , and learn about the weight over time. Under these
assumptions, however, the policymakers’estimation problem would resemble a system of
5 Notice that country i presumes that growth shocks are uncorrelated across countries. We make this
assumption in our baseline model only for simplicity, but will relax it in section 7.
6 As we will see below, the random e¤ect assumption greatly simpli…es policymakers’inference because
it implies tractable updating rules for their beliefs.

regressions with unequal variances, for which the posterior distribution is not available
in closed form and can only be evaluated numerically (see, for example, Gelman, Carlin,
Stern, and Rubin (2004)). For reasons of tractability, we have therefore opted for our
simpler speci…cation.
3. Postwar Dynamics and Geography of Market Orientation
In the rest of the paper, we explore the ability of our model of beliefs formation to
explain the observed choice of countries to follow market-oriented or state-interventionist
policies. We use data from the large panel of liberalizations (133 countries, 1950-2001)
originally constructed by Sachs and Warner (1995) and revised and extended by Wacziarg
and Welch (2008).
In this section, we describe the data, their behavior over time and across regions, and
use them to present evidence of the connection between policy choices and countries’past
growth performance under alternative policy regimes. The …ndings of this section motivate
the structural estimation exercise that we will undertake in sections 4 and 5.
3.1. Measuring market orientation. In order to investigate the dynamics of market
orientation, we need a measure of policy that is comparable across countries and over time.
As a proxy, we use the Sachs and Warner’s (1995, hereafter SW) indicator of liberalizations. This indicator was originally constructed as a measure of openness to international
trade, but it is better interpreted as a broader, albeit stark, measure of market orientation. Indeed, SW have been widely criticized because their indicator captures policy
interventions that go much beyond restrictions on international trade (see, for example,
Rodriguez and Rodrik (2000)).
SW argue that a government disposes of a variety of mechanisms to intervene in the
economy and restrict international trade. The most direct mechanism, of course, is to
impose tari¤s and other barriers on imports. Other mechanisms include taxing, restricting or monopolizing exports and limiting or blocking the convertibility of the country’s
currency. Finally, a socialist government is likely to have signi…cant distortions on international trade. Following this logic, SW require the following …ve criteria to classify a
country as “open”: (i) The average tari¤ rate on imports is below 40%; (ii) Non-tari¤
barriers cover less than 40% of imports; (iii) The country is not a socialist economy (according to the de…nition of Kornai (2002)); (iv) The state does not hold a monopoly of

LEARNING THE WEALTH OF NATIONS

11

the major exports; (v) The black market premium is below 20%. The resulting indicator
is a dichotomic variable. If in a given year a country satis…es all of these …ve criteria, SW
call it open and set the indicator to 1. Otherwise, the indicator takes the value of 0.7
Criteria (iii)-(v) capture forms of government intervention that go clearly beyond trade
policies. This is why, following the interpretation of Rodriguez and Rodrik (2000), we dub
a country as “market-oriented”if the SW indicator is equal to 1, and “state interventionist”
if it is equal to 0. Moreover, notice that the broadness of the indicator is an advantage for
us, not a concern. In fact, we are not interested in exploring the impact of trade policies
on economic growth, but rather explaining countries’policy decisions as a function of past
growth performances. Therefore, the broader the policy measure we use the better.
In our study, we use the revision of the SW indicator carried out by Wacziarg and Welch
(2008) who expanded the sample of countries and years and revised the information used
to classify the countries.8 The data are an unbalanced panel, partly because separations
and uni…cations have led to start or stop reporting some countries as independent entities.
Finally, it is important to recognize that the dichotomic nature of the SW indicator is
an important limitation. Countries with very di¤erent degrees of state intervention end
up being classi…ed equally. Moreover, the indicator fails to capture reforms if they do not
simultaneously move countries in all …ve criteria, e.g. China in later years. Unfortunately,
richer indicators, such as those produced by the World Bank or the Heritage Foundation,
are only available for a reduced sample of countries and a handful of recent years. The
large coverage of countries and years in the SW indicator is essential to study changes in
the orientation to markets, which, as we now show, happen only so often.
3.2. The dynamics of market orientation and growth. Figure 1 plots the evolution
of the world fraction of market-oriented countries according to the SW indicator. In 1950,
only about 30% of the countries qualify as market oriented. The spike in the late 1950s
re‡ects the creation of the European Economic Community, followed by the inclusion in the
sample of a number of state-interventionist developing countries. In the years from 1963
7 Since a complete panel dataset with all these criteria is not available for the entire postwar period,

SW and Wacziarg and Welch (2008) perform a complementary country by country analysis of large reform
episodes, in order to …nd out whether large changes in policies led a country not to meet (or start meeting)
some of these criteria. This extended dataset is referred to as the “panel of liberalization dates.”
8 For example, SW apply criterion (iv) only for African countries while Wacziarg and Welch extended
it to other regions. In general, for the same years as SW, the revision of Wacziarg and Welch lead more
countries to be classi…ed as market oriented relative to the original SW measure.

Figure 1. World average of market orientation and growth.
to 1984, the share of market-oriented economies increases only very marginally. However,
in 1985 we observe the beginning of a global movement towards market orientation that
continues until the end of the sample. By 2001, the fraction of market economies has
increased to almost 80%.
The world-wide average hides interesting regional di¤erences. Figure 2 displays the
fraction of market economies (with scale on the right-hand-side axis) within eight regions
of the world. Some of these regions started the sample as state interventionists and began a transition to market economies only later on. Earlier transitions towards market
orientation include Western Europe, with the creation of the European Economic Community, and the Asian/Paci…c region. On the contrary, North and Central America started
relatively market oriented. However, after the establishment of the Central American
Common Market and the di¤usion of economic policies based on import substitutions,
essentially only the U.S. and Canada remained market friendly between 1960 and 1985.
In order to relate policy choices and past growth performances, …gure 1 also plots
the (unweighted) average growth rate of per-capita GDP.9 Interestingly, many countries

Figure 2. Regional patterns of market orientation and growth

started opening to the market only after the growth collapse of late 1970s and early 1980s,
which was even more severe for state-interventionist economies. A similar pattern can
be observed at the regional level (…gure 2): most regions began a transition to market
orientation after the deterioration of their growth performances. Our model of belief
formation interprets those low growth episodes as the driving forces of the policy changes.

3.3. Reduced-form regressions. Before turning to structural estimation, we run reducedform regressions to examine further the relationship between policy choices and observed
growth rates.

(3.1)

E(

i

+

t

+

^

1 i;t 1 + 2 Ei;t 1 (yj

Here, the policy decision of country i in period t (

i;t )

is a function of its own past policy

a distance-weighted measure of other countries’policies (

i;t 1 )

and the distance-

weighted average growth rate over the previous 3 years of other countries under the two
^i;t
policy regimes (E

1 (yj

^i;t
= 1) and E

1 (yj

= 0)).11

Our theory predicts policies to be persistent (

1

> 0), due to the persistence of beliefs

implied by Bayesian updating. It also predicts that countries are more likely to pursue
market-oriented policies in periods in which market-oriented neighbors grow faster (

2

>

0), as a consequence of information spillovers. Similarly, in periods of faster growth of
state-interventionist neighbors, the probability of being market oriented should decline
(

3

< 0). Finally, the precision of the information about the success of market economies

depends on the number of countries following those policies. Therefore, our theory predicts
a positive correlation among policies (

4

> 0), provided that on average countries update

their beliefs about the bene…ts of market orientation upwards (which will be the case
according to the estimation results of our structural model). It is important to recognize,
however, that …nding

4

> 0 can also be symptomatic of a force of “fads and fashion” in

policy choices, which may also be in play in the data (see Banerjee (1992) or Bikhchandani,
Hirshleifer, and Welch (1992)).
Table 1 presents the estimation results of equation 3.1 in our data. In the …rst column, we estimate a simpli…ed version that excludes

Polity2 variable (column 5).
Table 1 reveals three robust features of the data, which are consistent with the predictions of our structural model. First, policies are very persistent (second row). The
probability that a country who was market oriented in period t

1 keeps the same policy

in period t is 85 to 95 percent larger than that of countries that were interventionist in
period t

1. Second, policy choices are highly correlated to past performance of policy

regimes (third and forth rows). For each additional point of per-capita GDP growth of
market-oriented (state interventionist) countries in the neighborhood of country i, the
long-run probability that country i is market oriented increases (decreases) by approximately 6 (9) percent in our speci…cation with …xed and time e¤ects. Finally, countries are
more likely to be market oriented when their neighbors followed the same policies (…fth
row).

We conclude this section by noting that these results must be interpreted with caution, in light of the “re‡ection” problem emphasized by Manski (1993). Speci…cally, the
identi…cation of endogenous interactions e¤ects (

4)

and contextual e¤ects (

2

and

3)

is

problematic due to the collinearity of the two e¤ects. In our model, however, this problem
is much less severe because neighborhoods are individual speci…c, which breaks the symmetry that causes the collinearity problem. On the other hand, the fact that we estimate
the structure of groups adds a non-trivial element of complexity relative to more standard
linear-in-mean models. Finally, the structural learning model that we study in the rest of
the paper belongs to a class of binary choice models where identi…cation is less problematic
(Brock and Durlauf, 2001a and b).
We now turn to the estimation of this model.

4. Inference
Like the agents of our model, we (the econometricians) are also Bayesian and wish
to construct the posterior distribution for the unknown parameters of the model. These
unknown coe¢ cients are:

If we collect the set of unknown coe¢ cients in the vector

and denote by D the entire

set of available data on policies and growth, standard application of Bayes rule delivers:
p ( jD) / L (Dj )
where p ( ), L ( ) and

( ),

( ) represent the posterior, sampling and prior densities respectively,

and / denote the proportionality relation. We now turn to the description of the priors
and the construction of the likelihood function.

18

4.1. Priors. Our model is quite heavily parameterized. Thus, the use of somewhat informative priors helps to prevent over…tting problems. For instance, we would like to avoid
cases in which we …t the data well, but only due to estimates of policymakers’ initial
beliefs which are clearly implausible. As an example, consider the literature on macroeconomic forecasting: highly parameterized models do well in-sample, but perform poorly
out-of-sample. The use of priors considerably improves the forecasting performance of
these models (see, for instance, Doan, Litterman, and Sims (1984), Litterman (1986) or,
more recently, Banbura, Giannone, and Reichlin (2007)). The role of priors is similar in
our context, as our ultimate goal is using the model to conduct a set of counterfactual
experiments.
To begin with, in order to reduce the number of estimated parameters, we calibrate
the correlation of initial beliefs about average growth under state intervention and market

prior densities:

These prior densities are parameterized as follows:
We set

S
0

= 0:0275 and

M
0

= 0:0125. We have chosen these numbers using the

Maddison data (Maddison (2006)). First of all, the average annual growth rate
of per-capita GDP of countries in the Maddison dataset in 1901-1950 (excluding
the years corresponding to the two wars) is approximately 2%. Then, we split the
countries in the Maddison dataset in two groups, according to the value of the SW
indicator in 1950. We …nd that, between 1946 and 1950, the state-interventionist
countries grew on average 1:5% faster than the market-oriented. The values of

that starting with a prior that most countries believed that state intervention
fostered growth is consistent with the fact that only about 30% of the countries

LEARNING THE WEALTH OF NATIONS

19

were market oriented in 1950. These priors are also consistent with the evidence
in Clemens and Williamson (2004). The value of ! is set to 0:025, which implies
a quite agnostic view about the mean of initial beliefs.
We select s and d so that
equal to 0:264. The prior on

i

has an a-priori mean and a standard deviation
i

is potentially important because it a¤ects the

speed of learning, especially for those countries for which fewer data are available.
In calibrating this prior we …rst observe that

2
i

2
i

should be approximately

equal to var(yi ), the variance of the average growth rate of GDP.12 We obtain
an estimate of var(yi ) = 0:01752 as the variance of the average growth rates of
the countries present in the Maddison dataset between 1901 and 1950 (excluding
the wars).13 To obtain an estimate of

2
i

based on pre-sample observations, we

use again the Maddison data and run a regression of GDP growth on time and
…xed e¤ects. We then compute the variance of the residuals for each country and
calculate the mean of these variances (which equals 0:0044). Therefore, we set the

mean of the prior for i to (0:0175)
0:0044

We select s and d so that

i;k

has an a-priori mean and standard deviation

equal to 0:01. The idea here is to discourage the model from …tting the data using
very large variances of the exogenous political cost Kit . This prior distribution
implies that, if policymakers believe that growth under market orientation is 1%
higher than under state intervention, they will adopt market-oriented policies with
probability 87% on average (standard deviation 10%).
As the coe¢ cients

are common to all countries, we use a ‡at prior for .

4.2. The likelihood function. In order to derive the posterior distribution of the unknown coe¢ cients, we update these priors with the likelihood information. Notice that
we have not postulated a true data generating process for GDP growth. We can do so
under the assumption that GDP growth depends only on actual policies and is not directly a¤ected by the policymakers’ beliefs that led to those policies. This is a natural
assumption which greatly simpli…es and robusti…es the inference about our parameters of
12 This can be seen by combining (2.5) and (2.6) and noticing that we cannot distinguish between
market-oriented and state interventionist countries in the pre 1950 data.
13 There is a huge outlier in the distribution of the average growth rates across countries. Therefore,
this variance is estimated with a robust method (squared average distance from the median of the 16 and
84th percentiles).

5. Results
This section presents various measures of …t and the estimation results for our baseline
speci…cation of the model. In this speci…cation, the weight that country i assigns to the
data of country j (wjji ) is a function of two variables: dji , physical distance (in thousands
of Km) between the capital of country j and country i, and `ji , a dummy variable equal
to 1 if countries i and j have the same o¢ cial language. In other words, zji = [dji ; `ji ] in
expression (2.11).
Extensions of the baseline model and robustness checks are presented in section 7.
5.1. The model’s …t. We begin by assessing how well our model …ts the data. Using
di¤erent criteria, we will argue that the model explains quite well the observed dynamics
of market-oriented policies over time and across countries.
First of all, the model correctly predicts 93% of the policy choices that we observe in
the data. Moreover, it accounts for 13%, 30%, 46% and 60% of the switches in policies,
within

0, 1, 2 and 3 year windows, respectively. Explaining changes in policies is a very

challenging test, because we only observe 101 policy switches in our dataset (2% of the
total policies). We are therefore quite satis…ed with the performance of the model.
Figure 3 reports the actual and predicted fractions of market-oriented economies present
in our sample. The model-predicted series corresponds to the sequence of one-step-ahead
predictions of the model, absent any political cost shock. For example, the value of the

Figure 3. Actual and model-predicted fraction of market-oriented countries
red dashed line in 1990 represents what the model predicts for the world share of marketoriented countries, given the information on GDP growth and policies up to 1989, and
assuming that in 1990 the shock to political costs is zero for each country. The …gure
makes clear that the model captures fairly well the high fraction of state-interventionist
economies in the …rst part of the sample, and the run-up towards market orientation
starting in the mid 1980s.
The success of the model along these dimensions is due to two main features of the
data. First, the ability of the model to match the initial low share of market-oriented
economies follows from the information in the pre-1950 data, which led to a calibration
of initial priors consistent with most countries believing that the state outperforms the
market. The …rst ten years of our estimation sample are also consistent with this idea.
Second, the wave of liberalizations started in the mid-1980s are partially explained by the
low growth observed in the 1970s and early 1980s. Through the lens of the model, past
growth experiences are important determinants of beliefs and policy dynamics.
Figure 4 provides a more disaggregated picture of the …t of the model, by comparing
the actual and predicted series for eight regions of the world economy. Notice that the

Figure 4. Actual and model-predicted fraction of market-oriented countries across regions

model captures well episodes of policy reversals (e.g. Central and South America) and
the heterogeneous timing of liberalizations (e.g. the earlier liberalizations in Asia and the
more protracted reforms in Africa).
It is also informative to analyze the cases where the model has some di¢ culties in
…tting the data. For example, the early experience of Western Europe is di¢ cult to
rationalize based on a simple learning story. This is presumably due to the fact that
the model abstracts from the postwar geopolitical forces that led to the integration of
Western European countries and the creation of the European Community. Similarly, the
fact that we slightly underpredict the number of liberalizations in the …nal part of the
sample suggests a potential role for complementarity in policies, a force absent in our
model.

Another way to evaluate the …t of the model is to look at the magnitude of the variability of political costs needed to match the data. Figure 5 presents an histogram of
p
f i;k = V ar(yi;t )gN
i=1 , i.e. the ratio between the posterior mode of the standard deviation of the political cost (

i;k )

and the standard deviation of the growth rate of GDP in

each country. Figure 5 makes the point that in essentially every case the variability of
the exogenous political cost necessary to explain the dynamics of policies is substantially
lower (on average 10 times lower) than the typical variability of GDP growth in the same
country.

5.2. Estimation results: the weighting function. Table 2 reports the estimates of
the vector of coe¢ cients

that determines the e¤ect of physical distance and language on

the weight that country i puts on information from country j:

TABLE 2: Estimates of the coe¢ cients of the weighting function in the baseline model.
Our estimates indicate that countries put signi…cantly more weight on data from countries nearby. Figure 6 plots the weight that country i puts on country j (wjji ) as a function
of distance (dji ). For instance, everything else equal, the weight that a country puts on
data from another country that is 2000Km away is almost 60% lower than the weight
on its own data. The other conclusion that can be drawn from table 2 is that cultural
distance matters: speaking the same language increases the weight that countries assign
to each other by approximately 35%.
With this information in hand we ask: Is learning globalized across the countries of the
world? The answer is no. Learning appears to be quite localized instead. Figure 7 plots
P
N
f j6=i wjji gi=1
, i.e. the total weight assigned by each country to the rest
the histogram of
w
iji

of the world, relative to the weight assigned to their own data. Recall from equation (2.11)
that this relative weight is a function of the distance measures and the relative volatility
of growth rates across countries.
There are essentially no countries that weight equally the data from the rest of world.
However, learning is not completely isolated either, as …gure 7 shows that the weight put
on data from other countries is substantial. Indeed, with the exception of two countries,
all countries end up putting more weight on the information from the rest of the world
that on their own data.
We conclude this subsection by comparing the …t of our baseline model to two alternative
speci…cations. First, we assume that countries only learn from their own past data (Mown ).
Second, we assume that countries learn globally, i.e., they do not discount information

speci…cation to these two alternative models. There are two things to notice: First, our
model dominates these alternatives, especially in terms of capturing the policy switches
in the data.14 Second, between the alternatives, the …t of the autarkic-learning model is
substantially better than the global-learning extreme. This last …nding also shows that a
model that abstracts from a rich geographical learning structure is unable to …t the data,
beside the complex structure of prior beliefs.

14 Compared to the alternatives, our model has two additional parameters.

Nevertheless, both a
likelihood ratio test or the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) would easily reject the restricted models.
Of course, the formal way of performing a model comparison exercise in a Bayesian framework would be
based on the comparison of the marginal data densities. However, the computation of the marginal data
density is computationally very costly for these models.

In sum, the weighting function plays an important role in our analysis. In the next
sections we will analyze its contribution to the evolution of policymakers’ beliefs about
the e¤ect of state intervention and market orientation on growth. Moreover, in section 7,

makers’prior beliefs about the e¤ect of market-oriented and state-interventionist policies
on growth. In estimating the model, we assume that the beliefs of countries entering
the sample after 1950 re‡ect their 1950 priors and subsequent data. Notice that initial

beliefs about the success of market economies were quite negative and characterized by
considerable dispersion across countries. According to our estimates, in 1950 about 65%
of the countries believed that market-oriented policies were inferior to state intervention
in terms of economic growth.
Figure 8b shows that, with the information accumulated over …fty years, the beliefs of

has moved to the right, with a perceptible majority of countries believing that market-

oriented policies are growth enhancing. However, quite interestingly, the dispersion of
beliefs across countries has declined, but certainly not disappeared.
Figure 8c provides a time series perspective on the evolution of beliefs, by plotting
expected growth under the two policies in the median country. As anticipated, the median
country started o¤ with beliefs biased towards state intervention and has slowly shifted
towards favoring market-oriented regimes.
Figure 9 summarizes the precision of these beliefs across countries and over time. Figure 9a plots a histogram of f

these policies is substantial. By 2001, countries have sharpened their views considerably,
although signi…cant doubts remain (…gure 9b). Finally, …gure 9c plots the evolution of
this uncertainty over time. At the end of the sample, the median country attaches a
standard deviation of approximately 0:4% to its estimates of average growth under state
intervention and market orientation.
We now have enough information to ask the important question: Has the world reached
a point in which the vast majority of policymakers are convinced that a market-oriented

the case. There still exists a considerable amount of negative views about the merits
of market economies. Moreover, many of those with a favorable view are either quite
uncertain or believe that the gains are quantitatively minimal. More speci…cally, in our
dataset only about 35 countries estimate average growth under market orientation to be
statistically signi…cantly (at the 95% con…dence level) higher than average growth under
state intervention, in 2001. As one would expect, the US, Western Europe and countries
like Honk Kong or Singapore belong to this small group.

6. Counterfactuals
In this section we address two questions:
(1) Do spillovers of information matter for the di¤ usion of market-oriented policies?
(2) Would many countries revert to state intervention if the world was hit by another
Great Depression?
We will argue that the answer to both of these questions is yes.

6.1. Autarkic and global learning. Our multicountry learning model allows for a
rather ‡exible speci…cation of the weighting function (2.11), according to which policymakers can discount information from other countries based on measures of physical
and cultural distance. In this subsection, we perform a counterfactual exercise in order to
understand how beliefs and policies would have evolved under some alternative scenarios.
In particular, we analyze two restricted versions of the model: a model in which countries
learn only from their own past experience (Mown ), and another one in which countries
do not discount information from places that are far away physically or culturally (Mall ).
Model Mown corresponds to driving the elements of
tained by setting

to

1, while model Mall is ob-

= 0. The other model coe¢ cients are kept …xed at the posterior mode

of the baseline estimation.
Figure 10 plots the evolution of median beliefs on the expected growth rates under state
intervention and market-oriented policies in the Mown model. Compared to the evolution
of beliefs estimated in our baseline model (see …gure 8c), countries learn very slowly since
they do not gain any knowledge from the experience of other countries. The absence of
cross-country spillovers would have slowed down the di¤usion of market-oriented policies to
the point that the world would still be, to a large extent, a collection of state-interventionist
economies.
On the contrary, if countries had weighted foreign data as much as their own, learning
would have been very fast. This point is nicely illustrated in …gure 11, which plots the
evolution of median beliefs about the e¤ect of state intervention and market-oriented
policies in the Mall model. With all the information available in the world uniformly used
across countries, the sample evidence would have quickly overtaken the initial unfavorable
views on markets, and market-based regimes would have prevailed as early as in the 1960s.
We conclude that the localization of learning might have severely slowed down the global
di¤usion of market-oriented policies.

6.2. Policy reversals: another Great Depression. We now consider how large negative world-wide shocks to GDP growth impact policy decisions. To accomplish this task
we conduct another counterfactual simulation exercise. Di¤erently from the previous subsection, we keep the estimated weighting scheme, but generate arti…cial paths of GDP
growth, in order to induce a global depression.

More speci…cally, these simulations are constructed as follows. Suppose that time

is

the starting point of the counterfactuals. Based on time- beliefs and the realization of
the exogenous political cost at time

+ 1, policymakers choose the value of the policy

variable; this policy choice contributes to the realization of GDP growth in period + 1; a
new vintage of data is now available and policymakers form time- + 1 beliefs by updating
their priors with the new information; and so on.
Contrary to the rest of the paper, in this subsection we need to postulate a true data
generating process for GDP growth. To keep things simple, we simulate the realization of
GDP growth in every period using the following stochastic process:

which corresponds to the average deviation across countries of the growth rate in 19291933 relative to the average growth between 1919 and 1928. Finally, the other model
parameters (initial beliefs, volatility of the political costs and coe¢ cients of the weighting
function) are set to the estimated posterior mode.
Before turning to the description of the results, we want to stress that the results of
this subsection are conditional on (6.1), i.e. the particular data generating process that
we have chosen for GDP growth. The process in (6.1) has two main advantages. First, it
is transparent and easy to cast into our model. Second, it closely resembles the growth
regressions that we assume our policymakers estimate to update their beliefs. Therefore,

LEARNING THE WEALTH OF NATIONS

33

if the forcing variable is set to fi;s = 0, our learning model eventually converges to a
self-con…rming equilibrium in which everybody knows the truth. On the other hand, in
using (6.1), we are making the strong assumption that the residuals of the GDP growth
equation (ei;s ) are uncorrelated with the policy variable (

i;s ).

While this is the case in

our model,15 it is possible to imagine situations in which this condition fails. The most
obvious of these situations is, for instance, a case in which the shocks to GDP growth
(ei;s ) are not independent from the political cost (Ki;s ).
Figure 12 plots the impulse response of the fraction of market-oriented countries to the
global shock. The two lines correspond to di¤erent starting points for the experiment
(di¤erent ). For instance, had such global depression hit the world in 1961, when the
world was mostly characterized by state intervention, it would have spawn the di¤usion of
market-oriented policies. A deep recession would have cast serious doubts on the growth
perspectives of economies heavily based on government controls. The opposite would
happen with a global recession in 2002. Given that by 2001 most countries are market
friendly, policymakers around the world would receive very precise negative signals about
the growth prospects of market economies. As a consequence, they would become pessimistic about the success of market-oriented policies much faster than about the e¤ects
of government intervention.
In sum, the recession would have large and persistent e¤ects. It would persuade about
13% of the countries to revert to state intervention and it would take almost forty years
for this e¤ect to wash out.
Of course things would be even worse if, for some reason, the recession had a relatively
more severe e¤ect on market economies. For instance, …gure 13 shows that the fraction
of countries reverting to interventionism after …ve years would be 20% if the recession
a¤ected market-oriented economies twice as much as state-interventionist ones (keeping
…xed the average e¤ect).
Summing up, would we observe policy reversals towards state intervention if the world
was hit by a severe recession? The answer of our estimated model is yes.

15 Policy decisions are predetermined in our model.

7. Sensitivity Analysis and Extensions
Our benchmark speci…cation assumes that policymakers base their policy decisions on
a relatively stylized model. In this section, however, we demonstrate that our results are
robust to various alternative speci…cations and extensions of the baseline framework.
7.1. Alternative weighting schemes. We …rst examine the robustness of our results
to changes in the speci…cation of the weighting function. For example, our baseline model
abstracts from the possibility that colonizers receive a disproportionately large or small
weight from former colonies. In fact, anecdotal evidence suggests that former colonies
might either follow closely the lead of a former metropolis or, alternatively, might be
biased against its policies. To explore the importance of these considerations, we augment
the weighting function with a dummy variable cji , which equals 1 if country j has been a
colonizer of country i and 0 otherwise. The second column of table 4 reports the results
of this speci…cation. The weight depends negatively on having been a colonizer, but the
estimated coe¢ cient is far from being statistically di¤erent from zero. Moreover, the

We next examine the role of economic distance, as measured by di¤erences in the level
of economic development. In addition to geography and cultural proximity, policymakers
might discount information from countries that are in a very di¤erent stage of the economic
development process. In order to investigate this possibility, we include an additional
variable

ji;t ,

de…ned as the absolute value of the log-di¤erence in GDP per-capita between

country i and country j at time t. The third column of table 4 shows a negative and
statistically signi…cant coe¢ cient on

ji;t ,

suggesting that, indeed, policymakers tend

to attach more weight to the experience of countries characterized by a similar level of
development. For example, information coming from a country in which GDP per-capita
is twice as much as in the home country receives 70% less weight. Also, notice that the
inclusion of

ji;t

in the weighting function reduces the coe¢ cient on geographical distance,

This is not surprising, since development has an important geographical component and
dji and

ji;t

are highly correlated. Interpreting a weighting structure that incorporates

per-capita GDP di¤erences is promising and deserves further investigation. This being
said, it is important to point out that the quantitative implications of this speci…cation of
the model are almost the same as in the baseline.
To assess the economic di¤erences of alternative models, …gure 14 plots the evolution
of the di¤erence between median expected growth under market orientation and state
intervention. All models (M4 , M5 and M6 are explained below) tell essentially the same
story about the evolution of beliefs.
As a …nal comparison, …gure 15 reports our counterfactual exercise of simulating the
policy response to another Great Depression starting in 2002 (see section 6.2). All models
have very similar quantitative implications.
7.2. Controlling for the political environment. Another important dimension of our
model is given by the speci…cation of the political cost. So far, we have assumed that Ki;t
has mean zero and is uncorrelated over time. We now examine the implications of allowing
this political cost to depend on variables measuring a country’s political environment.
For this extension, we need a measure of political environments that is comparable
across countries and over time. The “Polity IV” dataset is a multidimensional panel
that measures various aspects of the governance of countries and is widely employed in
research on political science and international relations. The main variable of the dataset
is the Polity2 score, which aggregates democratic and autocratic qualities of institutions.

It classi…es countries in a spectrum on a 21-point scale, ranging from

10 to +10 (see

Marshall and Jaggers (2005)).
To explore the possibility that the political cost of market-oriented policies depends on
the political environment, we replace (2.4) with the following speci…cation for Ki;t :

denotes the deviation of the Polity2 score for country i at time t from its

pooled mean. Notice that this speci…cation allows average political costs to di¤er across
countries because of the cross-country di¤erences in the average Polity2 score. Moreover,
the political cost inherits some of the autocorrelation of

i;t ,

which is usually highly

persistent.
The fourth column of table 4 reports the estimation results for this extension of the
model. First, notice that this model is the best in terms of explaining policy switches.

Second, the coe¢ cients of the weighting function are very similar to the baseline. Third,
the coe¢ cient

has a negative and signi…cant sign, implying that more democratic coun-

tries have a lower political cost of being market-oriented. To evaluate the magnitude of
, …gure 16 plots the model implied probability of being market oriented as a function of
the Polity2 score. The …gure is constructed for the case in which countries hold similar
beliefs about the e¤ects of market orientation and state intervention, and assuming that
k;i

= 0:53%.17 Everything else equal, a country with low Polity2 score is substantially

less likely to be market oriented relative to more democratic countries.
These results are sensible and indicate that the interaction of political variables with the
countries’learning mechanism that we introduce in this paper deserves further attention.
In terms of quantitative implications, however, the model’s implied evolution of beliefs
and response in the aftermath of a global Great Depression (recall …gure 15 and 14) are
very similar to those of our baseline model.

7.3. Spatially correlated growth shocks. In our benchmark model, policymakers treat
growth shocks as uncorrelated across countries. If in reality these shocks exhibit substantial spacial correlation, this assumption might bias our estimates of the geographic
localization of learning. Therefore, in this subsection, we analyze a more general model in
which policymakers take into account the spatial correlation structure of growth shocks.
In order to do so, we use all available data to run a panel regression of GDP growth on
the SW indicator and extract the residuals. We then estimate their covariance matrix by
assuming that the correlation coe¢ cient between country i and country j is non-negative
and has the following form:

corr ("i;t ; "j;t ) = crdji ,

LEARNING THE WEALTH OF NATIONS

where 0

c

1 and 0

likelihood, jointly with

41

r

1 are two coe¢ cients that we estimate by maximum

2 N .18
i i=1

Finally, we endow policymakers with the knowledge of

this correlation structure.
Our estimates of c and r indicate that growth shocks are weakly spatially correlated.
For instance, this correlation is equal to approximately 0:2 if two countries are 1000 km
apart. The …fth column of table 4 shows that the estimates of the weighting function
when we incorporate this correlation structure are very similar to the baseline model. The
implications of this model for the behavior of policymakers’beliefs and the consequences
of a counterfactual severe recession are also quite similar to the baseline (…gure 14 and 15).
In other words, empirically plausible levels of spacial correlation among growth shocks do
not substantially a¤ect our results.
7.4. Conditional convergence. In our …nal extension, we modify the speci…cation of
the empirical model that policymakers use to update their beliefs. More concretely, we
replace (2.2) with
(7.1)

This speci…cation allows for a country’s GDP growth rate to depend not only on policy
choices, but also on the logarithm of its investment-to-GDP ratio ( i ) and the gap between
the country’s GDP and the US (y ). Everything else equal, and assuming that

< 0,

under this speci…cation poorer countries grow faster, as in the convergence regressions of
Barro and Sala-I-Martin (1995).
Ideally, we would allow policymakers to learn about all of the unknown coe¢ cients of
(7.1). In practice, however, this is computationally extremely costly. Therefore, we set
=

0:0025 and

= 0:0149 and assume that policymakers know these values (that we

have chosen by running a panel regression using the entire set of available data).19
The last column of table 4 reports the estimates of the coe¢ cients of the weighting
function for this speci…cation of the model. Notice that these values are in line with our
18 We cannot estimate this correlations by simply using the sample covariances because of the unbalanced nature of our panel. Therefore, the estimate of the covariance matrix obtained by combining
pairwise sample covariances need not be positive de…nite. Alternatively, the covariance matrix estimated
using only overlapping observations for all countries would be very imprecise, since for some country
pairs we only have …ve of these observations.
19 We obtain a lower value for than Barro and Sala-I-Martin (1995), partly because we use a larger
sample of countries and years, and because we exploit variation of growth rates across countries and over
time.

baseline estimates. The overall …t of the model is slightly worse than the benchmark but
the evolution of beliefs (…gure 14) and the implied response to a Great Depression (…gure
15) are very similar, reinforcing our conclusion that that our main results are quite robust.

8. Concluding Remarks
We have explored the ability of a learning model to explain the observed transition of
countries between regimes of state intervention and market orientation. In our model, the
crucial determinants of policy choices are policymakers’beliefs about the relative merits
of the markets versus the state. These beliefs, in turn, are in‡uenced by past experience.
The estimated model …ts well the data of 133 countries for the postwar period. Our
results indicate that policymakers update their beliefs relatively slowly because they attach
little weight to information coming from countries that are geographically, culturally or
economically distant from their home country. This is important to explain the slow
adoption of market-oriented policies in the postwar period. Moreover, our …ndings suggest
that by the end of the sample many countries remain agnostic about the growth prospects
of market economies. Indeed, according to the model, a global GDP growth shock of the
size of the Great Depression would induce almost 15% of countries in the world to revert
to state intervention.
In this paper, we have focused on the evolution of beliefs as the driving mechanism
of policy changes and have abstracted from other forces that are undoubtedly important.
For example, we have not considered the higher incentives that a country might have to be
market oriented when other countries are also market oriented, as well as all other reasons
that may lead countries to herd behind the policy choices of other countries. It would
be interesting to allow for these policy complementarities and strategic interaction among
policymakers of di¤erent countries. Similarly, it seems important to enrich our model with
explicit political economy dimensions and examine how they interact with the mechanism
of beliefs formation that we have presented in this paper. These are our priorities for
future research.

calculations are conducted from the perspective of policymakers of country i.

As wiji = 1, equation (A.3) holds for any

to a weighted least square estimation problem. Given our assumption that policymakers
know the variance of the shocks to growth, f

the weights wjji

are known to

them as well. In practice, we run a panel regression of GDP growth on the SW indicator,
compute the variance of the residuals and endow policymakers with the knowledge of these
coe¢ cients.
It is then easy to show that the optimal updating formulas for the expectation of
policymakers’beliefs in country i are:

the beliefs that have led to those policy choices. This assumption allows us to evaluate the
likelihood function of

without taking a stand on

and the true data generating process

of GDP growth. It is important to note that, even in those cases in which this assumption
is undesirable, our methodology can still be interpreted as a limited-information estimation
strategy. Combining (B.1) and (B.3), we obtain the following result:
