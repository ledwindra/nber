    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper discusses conceptual problems of distinguishing \"expenditure\" policy from \"tax\" policy and \"deficit\" policy. The paper argues that each of these concepts is ill-defined and does not provide a useful basis for examining the government\" underlying fiscal policies. The fundamentals of fiscal policy involve changes in marginal incentives, inframarginal intra- and intergenerational redistribution, and direct government consumption. The paper reviews some of the effects of these fundamental policy choices on economic growth.\n\n",
