    "abstract": "\n\nThe close connection between US and China in scientific research and education in the 2000s produced a large group of China-born researchers who work in the US (\u201cdiaspora\u201d) and a larger group of China-born researchers who gained US-research experience and returned to do their research in China (\u201creturnee\u201d).  Analyzing 2018 Scopus data on research papers, we estimate that diaspora researchers contributed to 27% of US addressed papers, and that returnee researchers contributed to 38% of China addressed papers.  Both the number of papers with diaspora authors and the number of papers with returnee authors far exceeded the usual measure of US-China collaborative work, papers with both US and China addresses.  In terms of quality or impact, papers with diaspora or returnee authors averaged more citations and had higher proportions of publication in high CiteScore journals than other US-addressed or China-addressed papers.  Finally, papers with diaspora and/or returnee authors were at the center of the US-China coauthor network and major conduits of research findings between the countries in the network of scientific citations. The benefits of the US-China research connection notwithstanding, the link between the countries\u2019 research began to fray from 2018 through the early 2020s, with potential deleterious effects on each country\u2019s future research output and on global science writ large to which US and China are the two biggest contributors.\n\n",
