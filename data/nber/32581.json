    "abstract": "\n\nAutomatic enrollment is often used to increase retirement savings. What are the effects of using it (or, alternatively, requiring an active enrollment choice) to increase short-term savings? We evaluate two experiments in the U.K. at employers that enable workers to set up payroll contributions to fund short-term savings accounts. In the first experiment (N = 7,404), employees at two firms were randomly assigned opt-in, opt-out, or active choice enrollment into the short-term savings program. Nine months later, participation was 48 percentage points higher under automatic enrollment than opt-in enrollment, and average balances were \u00a3114 higher. In the second experiment (N = 3,605), after years of offering opt-in payroll contributions to fund a short-term savings account, the employer changed to opt-out enrollment for new hires only. In tenure month 18, participation in the short-term savings program was 48 percentage points higher under automatic enrollment, and average balances were \u00a3193 higher.\n\n",
