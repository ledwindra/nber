Preferences for Equality in Environmental Outcomes

NBER Working Paper No. 22644
September 2016
JEL No. D6,I1
ABSTRACT
Benefit-cost analyses of health regulations traditionally evaluate their economic efficiency—ignoring
equity. To help address the importance of equity, we develop a survey to elicit respondents’ preferences
towards equality in health risks stemming from environmental causes. Survey responses are used
to parameterize an Atkinson index over environmental health risks. We compare these results to similar
questions in the income context and find that respondents are significantly more averse to inequality
in health risks than in income. The mean respondent is willing to accept a 22% increase in average
health risk if risks are equally distributed in the population, but willing to accept a decrease of only
5% in average income if incomes are equally distributed in the population. We find that 30% of respondents
answer health risk questions lexicographically—always preferring an equal distribution of risks to
an unequal distribution, even if the latter makes everyone better off.

1. Introduction
Benefit-cost analysis judges health and safety regulations according to whether the
monetized benefits of risk reductions, as measured by individual WTP, exceed program costs.
One way to complement such analyses is to take into account the distributional effects of health
and safety policies. If a decision maker has a well-defined social welfare function (SWF) over
health risks in a population, the function can be evaluated to see whether the utility of the postpolicy distribution of health risks exceeds the pre-policy distribution of health risks.
We argue that the utility of a policy depends on the mean health outcome in a population
and on how it is distributed. For individuals who value equality, an uneven distribution will
lower their utility. There are many forms that a utility function over the distribution of outcomes
might take. Probably the most well-known is the Atkinson SWF (Atkinson 1970). For an
Atkinson SWF defined over a good, such as income or survival probability, utility can be written
as the product of the mean level of the good and an inequality index. For example, in the case of
the Atkinson SWF defined over incomes in a population, utility = mean income*(1-A), where A
is the Atkinson index. Higher values of A indicate greater inequality and reduce the value of
higher mean incomes. In the case of health risks (a bad), the Atkinson SWF must be modified:
utility, which is decreasing in health risk = mean health risk*(1+A'), where A' measures how
equally health risks are distributed. The modified Atkinson index is higher the more unequally
health risks are distributed (Sheriff and Maguire 2013).
Our goal in this paper is to estimate the parameters of individuals’ Atkinson SWFs
defined over environmental health risks—specifically, risks of cancer and lung disease. We do
this by confronting people with choices between environmental programs that result in health
risk distributions that differ in both average risk and level of equality. We use the responses to
parameterize an Atkinson SWF for cancer risks and a similar function for risks of lung disease.
This SWF could be used to evaluate programs that would alter the distribution of environmental
health risks in a population. The analysis also produces an Atkinson inequality index, A', for
health risks that reflects the preferences of our sample for equality of outcomes.
Our empirical estimates of public preferences for environmental health risk distributions
come from an Internet survey, administered in August 2015. The survey asks respondents to
choose between environmental programs that result in different mean health risks in a population
and different distributions of these risks. Respondents make these choices (a) in a situation in
which they (and their families) are not affected by the choices, and (b) in a situation in which
they are affected, to see how this alters preferences. We also use “leaky bucket” experiments to
elicit respondents’ preferences for income inequality and a repeated coin toss question to gauge
risk aversion.
The results of our survey suggest that people are willing to accept a program that delivers
higher total environmental health risk provided this risk is equally distributed across the
population. Specifically, the median respondent is willing to accept a 50 percent increase in
mean health risk (e.g., total environmental cancer cases) if these risks are distributed equally in
the population. Interestingly, this result is the same whether the respondent and his family are
1

affected by the program or not. When we compare preferences for income equality to
preferences for equality in the distribution of health risks, we find that the proportionate sacrifice
people are willing to accept in the mean outcome to ensure equality in the distribution of
outcomes is greater for health than for income: inequality aversion is higher for health risks than
for income.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a theoretical
context for our study. We review the theory of inequality aversion in a welfare framework and
briefly discuss how we estimate inequality aversion parameters using our survey. Section 3
provides detailed information about the survey questionnaire. Section 4 summarizes and analyzes
survey results. Section 5 concludes.

2. Theory
2.1 The Atkinson Social Welfare Function for Income
To motivate our approach to eliciting preferences, we briefly review the theory of SWFs.
We begin with the case of SWFs defined over goods—such as income or survival probability—
and then indicate how a SWF must be modified when the argument of the function is a bad, such
as risk of cancer.
For concreteness, consider a SWF defined over the incomes (y1,y2,. . . . ,yN) of N
individuals in a population, where incomes have been ordered from lowest to highest. Define
ω(i) as the welfare weight attached to person i. Blackorby and Donaldson (1980) demonstrate
that any social welfare function that obeys the Pareto Principle, maintains the anonymity of
individuals, and allows for the possibility that only the welfare of a portion of the population
affects social welfare, must be written in the form (1). As in the income inequality literature, we
interpret (1) as a cardinal utility function. 1
(1)

𝑊(𝑦1 , 𝑦2 , 𝑦3 , … , 𝑦𝑁 ) = ∑𝑖 𝑈(𝑦𝑖 )𝜔(𝑖)

If ω(i)=1 and U(yi) = (1-ε)-1(yi)1-ε, then the SWF is of the Atkinson form. That is,
(2)

𝑊(𝑦1 , 𝑦2 , 𝑦3 , … , 𝑦𝑁 ) = �

∑𝑖(1 − 𝜀)−1 (𝑦𝑖 )1−𝜀 , 𝜀 ≥ 0, 𝜀 ≠ 1
∑𝑖 ln (𝑦𝑖 ),
𝜀=1

1

An important property of the Atkinson SWF, which we test in our survey, is that it is scale-independent; that is, the
rate of substitution between the incomes of persons i and j depends only on the ratio of their incomes.

2

The parameter ε captures the decision maker’s attitudes toward income inequality. If ε =
0, all that matters is the aggregate (i.e., average) income in the population—how it is distributed
is irrelevant. Higher values of ε imply a greater preference for income equality. As ε increases,
the decision maker places greater weight on transferring income from a high-income individual
to a low-income individual. 2
This can be seen more clearly by defining the Equally Distributed Equivalent (EDE)
income. The EDE is the income that, if equally distributed, would yield the same utility as the
existing distribution of income. For the Atkinson SWF, the EDE is given by:

(3)

𝐸𝐷𝐸 = �

1

1

1−𝜀 1−𝜀
� ,
� 𝑁 ∑𝑁
𝑖=1[𝑦𝑖 ]
1
𝑁

∏𝑁
𝑖=1[𝑦𝑖 ] ,

𝜀 ≥ 0, 𝜀 ≠ 1

𝜀=1

The higher is ε, the lower is the EDE. As noted above, the EDE may also be written as the
product of mean income (𝑦�) and (1-A), where A is the Atkinson index of income inequality,
(4)

𝐸𝐷𝐸 = 𝑦� ∗ (1 − 𝐴).

Equation (4) implies that A can be interpreted as the maximum proportion of income that the
decision maker is willing to give up if the remainder is equally distributed. The Atkinson
inequality index may also be written as a function of (y1,y2,. . . . ,yN):

𝜀=1

2.2 Social Welfare Functions for Bads
As Sheriff and Maguire (2013) point out, the desirable properties of the Atkinson SWF
no longer hold if the argument of the function is a bad, such as the risk of contracting cancer. Let
xi be person i’s risk of contracting cancer. The modified Atkinson SWF is given by:
(6)

𝑊(𝑥1 , 𝑥2 , 𝑥3 , . . . , 𝑥𝑛 ) = − ∑𝑖(1 + 𝛼)−1 (𝑥𝑖 )1+𝛼 , 𝛼 > −1.

2

The Atkinson utility function implies that the marginal rate of substitution between person i’s and person j’s
ε
income = (yi/yj)- .

3

Equation (6) is similar to equation (2); however, welfare is decreasing in health risk. The
parameter 𝛼 has a similar interpretation as ε above: higher values of α indicate greater inequality
aversion. Analogous to the case of goods, the EDE for health risk (EDE') can be defined as the
level of risk the decision maker would accept, if it were to be equally distributed, that would
yield the same utility as the current distribution of health risks. For 𝛼 > 0, the EDE' will be
greater than the mean risk (𝑥̅ ). EDE' is given by equation (7):
(7)

𝐸𝐷𝐸′ =

1

1

1+𝛼 1+𝛼
� 𝑁 ∑𝑁
�
𝑖=1[𝑥𝑖 ]

Analogous to equation (4), the EDE can be written as the product of mean risk (𝑥̅ ) and (1+A'),
where A' is the Atkinson inequality index for health risks:
(8)

𝐸𝐷𝐸′ = 𝑥̅ ∗ (1 + 𝐴’).

The modified Atkinson index, A', is the proportionate increase in average risk that the decision
maker would accept if risks were equally distributed in the population.

2.3 Estimating Preferences for Inequality
The preceding section suggests that, if we can elicit the respondent’s EDE for an unequal
distribution of health risks, we can use equation (7) to estimate the parameter α of his SWF and
equation (8) to estimate the Atkinson index of inequality aversion. This is the approach we
follow in our survey. Initially, we present the respondent with a choice between two programs
that will result in equal total health risks; however, one program will result in risks being equally
distributed in the population while the other will distribute risks unequally. If a respondent
prefers the equal distribution of risks, the average risk of the program delivering equal risks is
raised until the individual prefers the program with the lower average risk but unequal
distribution of risks. This bounds the respondent’s EDE' and allows us to solve for A' and α.
Similarly, if the respondent initially prefers the program that results in unequal risks, the risks
delivered by the other program are reduced until the respondent switches to that program. This
likewise bounds the respondent’s EDE' and allows us to solve for A' and α.

3. Survey
Our survey consists of five sections. In the first two sections, we elicit respondents’
inequality aversion in the context of health risks from environmental causes. In the third, we
present respondents with a simple series of standard gamble questions using a coin flip to elicit
their risk aversion. In the fourth section, we use a leaky bucket experiment to study inequality
aversion in the context of income. Finally, we collect relevant demographic and behavioral
information from respondents.
The internet questionnaire was distributed to 913 respondents using SurveyMonkey
Audience, a service that distributes surveys to the US population. We are not asserting
representativeness but expect these exploratory results inform future work. The following section

4

describes the survey in detail. Appendix II provides further information about survey
development.

3.1 Environmental Cleanups
To elicit inequality aversion in the context of health risks, we present respondents with a
series of dichotomous choice questions outlining two hypothetical programs aimed at lowering
cancer risks in a state. The unidentified state is divided into two identical regions, and pollution
sources in the regions are in a “program” to lower cancer risks. We show respondents final risk
distributions summarizing the effect of each program on the two regions’ risks of cancer. One
program focuses cleanup in one of the two regions, leading to an unequal distribution of health
risks. The other program addresses pollution sources in both regions, resulting in an equal
distribution of health risks in the state. 3
We provide respondents with a graph and table to assist in choosing between the
programs. The graph and table for the first question are displayed in Figure 1. Respondents are
then asked which program they advise the state to choose.

3

Following a description of the environmental cleanups scenario, respondents are asked to answer four true-or-false
comprehension questions related to the script. After answering, they are given the right answers. Our aim is to
measure whether respondents understand the questions unaided and then to ensure that respondents fully understand
the script and are taking the survey seriously.

5

Figure 1. Environmental Cleanups Example

Initially, as shown in Figure 1, the state’s average risk of cancer from environmental
causes is equal under both programs. In subsequent questions, the equal distribution of risks in
Program B is changed so that respondents must make a new choice between distributions with
different mean risks. Inequality-averse respondents—those who chose Program B in the first
question—face a new Program B distribution with higher risks for both regions. Respondents
who chose Program A in the first question face a new Program B distribution with lower risks

6

for both regions. In both instances, Program A is left unchanged. This process is repeated to
elicit each respondent’s Equally Distributed Equivalent (EDE) to the Program A distribution. 4
We present this series of questions to each respondent twice. In the first instance,
respondents are told they do not live in the state, nor do they know anyone who lives in the state.
Our aim in separating respondents from the programs is to isolate their preferences for equality
in health risks—independently of how it might affect them or their friends and family. Removing
respondents from the outcome is common in the experimental literature (see Johansson-Stenman
et al. 2002; Carlsson et al. 2005). In the second instance, respondents are told that they live in the
state; hence the two programs will directly affect their risk of cancer from environmental causes.
However, they do not know in which region of the state they live. In this section, responses may
also be affected by the respondent’s risk aversion. 5 We reverse the order of these scenarios for
235 respondents to test whether the ordering of questions affects their responses.

3.2 Leaky Bucket Experiment
In addition to eliciting inequality aversion in the context of environmental health risks,
we use a series of leaky bucket questions to elicit respondents’ aversion to income inequality.
We do this both to contrast the results with those for health and to compare our results with those
of others who have performed leaky bucket experiments. These experiments, initially proposed
by Okun (1975), are often employed in the inequality literature to measure attitudes toward
inequality (Amiel et al. 1999; Beckman et al. 2004; Pirtillä and Uusitalo 2010). We present
respondents with a simplified distribution of income in the United States for the year 2013. To
remain consistent with the health risk portion of the survey, we display the income distribution in
two bars—one for the bottom 40 percent of households and one for the top 40 percent.
Respondents are asked the following question:
Assuming you have the authority, would you be willing to reduce the income of each household
in the top 40% by $1000 to increase the income of each household in the bottom 40% by $1000?

4

A respondent who prefers a 7-7 distribution to a 1-9 distribution but prefers a 1-9 distribution to an 8-8 distribution
would have an EDE between 7 and 8.
5
Focus group feedback indicated that there is substantial heterogeneity among respondents in how much they weigh
their own risks versus the risks to society. Individuals who think only about the risks to themselves will offer
responses dictated mainly by risk aversion, whereas individuals thinking about society will reveal preferences
related to inequality aversion.

7

Each respondent who answers “yes” is then asked if she would be willing to make the
same transfer, but with less money going to the bottom 40 percent. 6 The “leakage” continues to
increase until respondents are either unwilling to make the transfer or are willing to accept 90
percent leakage, with $100 going to the bottom 40 percent of households. The maximum
tolerable leakage (MTL), used to calculate an inequality aversion parameter, falls between the
last accepted transfer and the first rejected transfer. 7 We use the results from the leaky bucket
experiment to compare inequality aversion in the health and income contexts. Additionally, we
compare our leaky bucket results with similar experiments in the literature.

3.3 Additional Questions
In addition to the environmental cleanups and leaky bucket sections, we present
respondents with a series of questions to better understand their attitudes toward and experiences
with risk, the environment, health, and altruism. In one set of questions, respondents are asked
whether they would prefer a certain amount of money (e.g., $50) to an amount determined by the
flip of a coin (e.g., $10 if heads, $90 if tails). By varying the certain amount of money, we are
able to elicit respondents’ risk preferences for money. Additionally, we ask respondents about
their purchases of lottery tickets and trip cancellation insurance for flights. We also ask
respondents whether they or their family or friends have experienced cancer.
We include several questions related to altruism in the survey. First, we ask whether
respondents belong to or donate money to an environmental organization. Second, we ask
respondents whether they have volunteered their time to a community organization in the past
year. Finally, we ask respondents how much money they have donated to nonreligious charitable
organizations and to which types of charities they have donated money in the past year.

3.4 Treatments
We examine the effect of scale, type of health risk, and the ordering of questions through
the use of four additional versions of the survey. In our second version of the survey, we change
the health risk from cancer to chronic lung disease, including chronic bronchitis, asthma, and
emphysema. Respondents were four times more likely to have no personal, friend, or family

6

For $1,000 transfers from the top 40 percent of households, subsequent leaky bucket transfers going to the bottom
40 percent are $750, $500, $250, and $100. Focus group feedback helped select this range of transfers. Smaller
transfers often didn’t seem “worth the trouble.”
7
The inequality aversion parameter (ε) is calculated from the following equation, where MTL is expressed in
percentage terms: MTL = 1 – [(ylow /yhigh)ε].

8

experience with chronic lung disease compared with cancer. 8 Our third version of the survey
varies the scale of the risks in the environmental health and leaky bucket questions. In choosing
to use the (modified) Atkinson index, we assume that individuals have utility functions that
exhibit constant relative aversion to inequality—implying that scale is irrelevant. We test the
effect of scale on respondents’ inequality aversion by decreasing all risks by a factor of 1,000. 9
All transfers in the leaky bucket questions are decreased by a factor of 10.
In the fourth version of the survey we reverse the order of the local and nonlocal
environmental cleanups for roughly a fifth of the sample (hereafter, version Order A). In the fifth
version of the questionnaire we present the leaky bucket questions before questions on health
risks (hereafter, version Order B). Exact sample sizes for each of the treatment groups are
displayed in Table 1.

4. Results
4.1 Descriptive Statistics
Survey completion rates are displayed in Table 1. In total, 1,676 individuals opened our
surveys through SurveyMonkey Audience, SurveyMonkey’s survey distribution service. Of the
1,315 individuals who answered at least one question, 913 (69 percent) finished the entire
survey. 10 Completion rates were fairly consistent across the five surveys, each of which received
between 219 and 379 responses. We are unable to comment on any sample selection bias arising
from individuals dropping out of the survey—SurveyMonkey provides demographic information
only for the paid, completed responses.

8

110 of 767 respondents (14.3 percent) in the surveys using cancer risks reported no personal, friend, or family
history with cancer; 83 of 146 respondents (56.9 percent) in the lung disease survey reported no history with chronic
lung disease.
9
Focus group feedback indicated that few respondents thought about the magnitude of the health risks being
considered.
10
Our completion rates are likely affected by the surveys’ exceptional length and complexity compared with most
surveys distributed through SurveyMonkey, a platform typically used for shorter, market research surveys. Our
surveys have 50 questions, many of which are cognitively burdensome. For a discussion of completion rates in
SurveyMonkey, please see https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/2015/06/25/tips-increasing-survey-completionrates/.

new survey. Those that read through any opening instructions and answered at least one question are
represented in the Started Survey column. Pilot survey results are omitted from this table.

Demographic information is summarized in Table 2. Several groups are overrepresented
in our sample compared with national figures. In particular, whites, females, and older persons
appear in higher proportions in our sample than in the population at large. Of our sample, 84
percent self-identify as white, compared with 74 percent of the US population. Male respondents
constitute only 34 percent of our sample, and the age profile is skewed toward older age groups.
The makeup of our sample likely reflects the population of internet users with spare time.
Survey respondents took 25 minutes on average to complete the survey. Similar to Dickie
and Gerking (2011), concerns arose over the length of time respondents took on the survey.
Equal proportions of respondents appeared to take the survey very quickly and very slowly—
perhaps in more than one sitting; 55 respondents (6 percent) took more than 45 minutes to
complete the survey, and many seemingly left the survey idle for several hours. Top-coding
completed surveys at 45 minutes yields an average length of 19 minutes. 11 Pretests indicated
that, at a minimum, the survey would take 8 minutes to complete, but 60 respondents (6.6
percent) took less than 8 minutes, likely because of skimming or skipping important instructions.
On average, these respondents answered twice as many preliminary comprehension questions
incorrectly. 12

11

The distribution of completion times is graphed in Figure A1 of Appendix I.
A two-sample t-test with unequal variances indicates that the mean number of incorrect questions are statistically
different between respondents taking less than and more than 8 minutes (t = -7.9).

Notes: Maximum tolerable leakage (MTL) is the maximum percentage of money that disappears from the
$1,000 transferred from the top 40% of households to the bottom 40% of households. Each cell displays the
percentage of respondents in each survey with a given MTL. The inequality aversion parameter for each
MTL is calculated at the midpoint of the interval. Likewise, mean MTLs use the midpoint.

Overall, we find that many respondents are willing to accept transfers in the leaky bucket
experiment, indicating some level of inequality aversion: 59.4 percent of respondents were
willing to accept a $1,000 transfer from the top 40 percent of households to the bottom 40
percent of households (ε>0). Willingness to accept the transfer is highest in the scale survey,
where we start transfers at $100 rather than $1,000. The likelihood of accepting a transfer in the
scale survey is not, however, statistically different from the likelihood in the other surveys (p =
0.143, one-tailed t-test). This suggests that the scale independence assumption underlying the
Atkinson index is correct.
We see little to no evidence that respondents are lexicographically averse to leakage.
Roughly three-quarters of respondents willing to make a no-leakage transfer also accepted a
transfer with 25 percent leakage. This finding supports feedback from focus groups that indicated
respondents were not fixated on the leakage so long as we avoided mentioning the instrument for
redistribution (e.g., taxes).

rather than quintiles, but the formula is identical. The remainder of the income distribution does not enter into the
calculation of ε.

12

Using interval midpoints for the MTLs, the mean MTL corresponds to a leakage of 32.2
percent and ε = 0.21. The median MTL is significantly lower, at 12.5 percent, corresponding to ε
= 0.07. These values are similar to those reported in the leaky bucket literature. Amiel et al.
(1999) report a mean ε = 0.25 and median ε values between 0.10 and 0.22. This suggests that our
respondents have preferences similar to those participating in other such surveys.
Using equation (5), we apply these values of ε to calculate an Atkinson index for income,
A. Mean incomes for household income quintiles in 2014 from the US Census Bureau are used in
the calculation. Using the mean and median values of ε, we calculate A as 0.051 and 0.021,
respectively. This implies that respondents are willing to give up between 2.1 and 5.1 percent of
mean (aggregate) income if the remainder is equally distributed. Below, we compare this with
respondents’ Atkinson index for health risks.
4.2.1 Explaining Income Inequality Aversion
In this section, we investigate the predictors of inequality aversion. Table 4 displays how
respondents’ MTLs are affected by their self-reported political identification. Whereas 87.9
percent of extremely liberal respondents are willing to accept a no-leakage transfer, only 16.2
percent of extremely conservative respondents are similarly willing. These rates smoothly
transition along the political spectrum. Similarly, the mean MTL for respondents decreases as
respondents identify themselves as more conservative. 14

14

Our sample included more liberal respondents than conservative respondents (443 versus 260). Part of this may
reflect US demographics, but it is likely that liberals are still overrepresented. See http://www.peoplepress.org/2015/04/07/a-deep-dive-into-party-affiliation/ for polls on party affiliation.

Notes: Mean MTLs use the midpoint of the intervals displayed in Table 3. Predictive margins for each political
category use our preferred specification, column 2, from the interval regression displayed in Table 5.

The results in column 3 of Table 4—using the midpoint of the MTL intervals—are
imprecise. The strong link with political affiliation suggests that other sociodemographic
characteristics might explain outcomes. Because the MTLs are actually in interval form (see
column 1 of Table 3), we follow Carlsson et al. (2005) and use an interval regression to examine
the effects of various covariates, including political identification, on leaky bucket choices. In
column 1 of Table 5 we present results for a base set of exogenous regressors. Our preferred
specification (2) also includes political covariates. Political beliefs overwhelmingly explain
much of respondents’ MTL choices, and the predictive results are displayed in Table 4, column
4. Similar to the pattern seen in Table 4 (column 3), MTLs decrease as respondents become more
conservative. But the relationship with political identification becomes monotonic (note the
differences in columns 3 and 4 for the less extreme political identifications) and are more
accepting of making a transfer for all but one group.
Turning to the other covariates, very high income individuals have lower MTLs
compared with the lowest income category when controlling for other covariates. In other words,
they are less willing to accept transfers to low-income households in the presence of leakage.
Education, age, gender, having children, and survey version have no significant effect on
respondents’ MTL. Interestingly, Asians are more willing than whites to make leaky bucket
transfers, and Hispanics are significantly less willing.

4.3 Coin Flip and Risk Aversion
We presented respondents with a series of questions designed to elicit their attitudes
toward risk. The following situation was shown to respondents in a repeated fashion, with X
varying from $10 to $90:

15

Consider a situation where you are presented with the following two options. Please select the
option you prefer.
•
•

You receive $X.
You flip a coin. If it shows heads, you receive $90. If it shows tails, you receive $10.

The smallest certain amount that respondents would accept rather than taking a gamble is
the certainty equivalent (CE) of the gamble. We identify respondents’ certainty equivalents
(CEs) by identifying where they switch from preferring the gamble (coin flip) to the certain
amount. CEs are summarized in Figure 2.

Figure 2. Certainty Equivalents for Coin Flip

16

There are two important takeaways from Figure 2. First, most respondents appear to be
risk averse: 756 of 913 respondents (82.8 percent) prefer receiving a certain amount of money
that is less than the expected value of the coin flip ($50) to undertaking the gamble. Second, a
small portion of individuals (14.8 percent) exhibit responses that could be considered irrational,
either preferring a certain $10 to a coin flip with a $10 minimum payment, or preferring the coin
flip to a certain $90. 15 There is some evidence that respondents with irrational responses may
have been rushing. Individuals who took less than eight minutes to complete the survey were
nearly twice as likely (13.8 versus 24.1 percent) to have irrational responses in this section.
Education may also play a role; individuals without a college degree were more likely to exhibit
irrational responses (19.6 percent) than individuals with a college degree (12.7 percent). Finally,
respondents reporting family incomes less than $50,000 were 2.3 times more likely to exhibit an
irrational response (19.8 versus 8.6 percent).
Assuming constant relative risk aversion, we can calculate a coefficient of relative risk
aversion (RRA) for each rational respondent. The coefficient, 𝛽 is calculated using the following
formula:
(9)

𝑈(𝑦) = �

(1 − 𝛽)−1 (𝑦)1−𝛽 , 𝛽 ≠ 1
ln(𝑦) ,
𝛽=1

Utility is a function of y, the income received from the coin flip scenario, and 𝛽, the
coefficient of RRA. The expected utility for the coin flip, 0.5*U(10) + 0.5*U(90), is equated
with U(CE), the utility at the certainty equivalent. We then solve equation (9) to find 𝛽 for each
CE. These coefficients are presented in Table 6, along with the distribution of answers in our
survey. Positive values for β imply aversion to risk, and negative values imply risk-loving
attitudes.

Of the 135 irrational responses, 104, or 11.4 percent of the entire sample, exhibited a CE of less than $10, and 31,
or 3.4 percent of the entire sample, exhibited CEs greater than $90.

17

The mean certainty equivalent for rational respondents of $37.8 corresponds to β = 0.61.
The median CE for all respondents is $35, with a corresponding 𝛽 = 0.74. In a similar study
using coin flip outcomes of $0 and $100, Prosser and Wittenberg (2007) find a median CE of
$37, corresponding to 𝛽 = 0.30.

4.4 Environmental Cleanups
4.4.1 Comprehension Questions
Following a description of the environmental cleanups scenario, respondents are asked to
answer four true-or-false comprehension questions related to the script. Our aim is to ensure that
respondents fully understand the script and are taking the survey seriously. The results from the
comprehension questions are summarized in Table 7. The percentage of individuals who
answered three or four of the statements correctly was 80.8, with 3 being the median outcome
and 3.06 the mean outcome. 16

4.4.2 EDE Results for Health Risks
Figure 3 summarizes responses to the environmental cleanup sections. Through a set of
dichotomous choice questions, we place bounds on the equally distributed equivalents (EDE) for
each respondent, compared with a 1–9 risk distribution. Preferring a 7–7 distribution to a 1–9
distribution but rejecting an 8–8 distribution would yield an EDE between 7 and 8. EDEs above
5 indicate some level of inequality aversion. People who have EDEs above 5 prefer more equal
distributions of population risk even if this means increasing the total risk in the population, and
EDEs under 5 correspond to people who care more about population risk than its distribution.
We find significant evidence of lexicographic preferences, which in our context are preferences

16

Most respondents with one answer incorrect failed to recognize that Program A focuses cleanup in one randomly
selected region. This is reflected in some open-ended responses—some respondents thought that the region with
lower risks would be the economically advantaged group rather than a randomly chosen group.

19

for an equal distribution (versus the 1–9 distribution), regardless of the risk levels in the equal
distribution.

Figure 3. Environmental Cleanup EDEs

Most respondents have preferences consistent with inequality aversion. In the nonlocal
context (the scenario in which the respondent does not live in the state), 85.4 percent of EDEs
are more than 5. Most striking in Figure 3 is the number of lexicographic responses: 267
respondents (29.2 percent) in the case of nonlocal cleanups and 290 respondents (31.8 percent) in
the case of local cleanups have EDEs with a lower bound of 9. These individuals prefer equal
risk distributions where neither population group is better off compared with the 1–9 distribution.
We discuss these lexicographic preferences below.

20

Tables 8 and 9 further summarize our results. Median EDEs in both the nonlocal and
local scenarios are 7.5, again implying that respondents are generally inequality averse. For
lexicographic respondents, we have only a lower bound on their EDE, 9. To calculate mean
EDEs, we drop all lexicographic responses and assign EDEs to the midpoints of each interval.
Mean EDEs for nonlocal and local cleanups are 6.1 and 6.0, respectively. 17

17

The two EDEs are not statistically different.

We convert the EDE interval midpoints to the inequality aversion parameter, α, using
equation (7). The conversion is shown in Table 10. In addition to calculating α, we use equation
(8) to calculate modified Atkinson indices, A', for each EDE.

For mean and median EDE values of 6.1 and 7.5, the corresponding α parameters are
0.72 and 2.8. The large difference between these values reflects both the effect of lexicographic
responses—included only in the median calculation—and the nonlinear relationship between
EDE and α. The modified Atkinson indices, A', are 0.22 and 0.50 using the mean and median
EDEs, respectively. An Atkinson index of 0.22 (0.50) implies that respondents are willing to
accept an increase in average risks of 22 percent (50 percent) if the risks are equally distributed
in the population.
4.4.3 Lexicographic Preferences
A significant portion of our sample—nearly 30 percent of respondents—exhibits
lexicographic preferences with respect to health risk inequality. Regardless of the mean risk
levels for the two distributions, these individuals always prefer the equal distribution. In this
section, we attempt to explain this behavior by analyzing open-ended responses and
comprehension questions, and we estimate a logit model to explain lexicographic preferences as
a function of sociodemographic covariates.
Respondents were asked to explain their responses to the dichotomous choice questions.
We analyze their explanations and find that 131 of 267 lexicographic respondents (49.1 percent)
clearly cited equality, fairness, or affecting as many residents as possible. 18 Nearly two-thirds of
the respondents included the words or roots equal, same, even, fair, or equi-, as in the following
examples:
•
•
•
•
•

“Even with a greater loss it is a more ‘fair & level’ playing field for everyone.”
“You can’t pick one region over another. It isn’t fair.”
“10 for every 1000 is not a great outlook, but if everyone is even across the board; then
it’s a better decision.”
“I think everyone should have equal access to a clean environment.”
“I will always choose equal risk. Get used to it.”

18

Most of the remaining 51 percent of open-ended responses are either vague (e.g., “Better outcome”), nonresponse
(e.g., “xx,” “n/a,” or “fggrgh“), or indicative of confusion.

23

Although roughly half of respondents exhibiting lexicographic preferences seem to
rationalize their responses through equality and fairness, it may be possible that this group
fundamentally misunderstands the scenarios presented to them. We test this by using the
preliminary comprehension questions as an indicator of how well respondents understand the
scenarios presented to them. Of four comprehension questions, respondents answered 3.06
questions correctly on average. Figure 4 displays the nonlocal EDEs, broken down by whether
respondents answered all four comprehension questions correctly. Respondents appear less likely
to have EDEs on both ends of the histogram when they answer the comprehension questions well
or perfectly.

Figure 4. Nonlocal EDE, by Comprehension Score

24

Comprehension appears to affect the likelihood of exhibiting lexicographic preferences.
Respondents answering all four comprehension questions correctly are 30 percent less likely to
answer lexicographically than respondents with three or fewer comprehension questions correct.
Despite this evidence that some lexicographic respondents may have misunderstood the
scenarios, there remains a significant fraction of individuals (23.6 percent) with lexicographic
preferences among a subsample who answered all four comprehension questions correctly. 19
We also fit a logit model to estimate the likelihood of respondents’ exhibiting
lexicographic preferences. The results, displayed in Table 11, support the notion that ideological
beliefs about fairness may help explain lexicographic responses. Political leanings appear to have
a significant influence on the odds of answering lexicographically. Extremely liberal individuals
are significantly more likely to exhibit lexicographic preferences than respondents who
characterize themselves as slightly conservative or slightly or moderately liberal.
Coefficient estimates on the number of comprehension questions answered correctly
indicate a decrease in the log-odds of exhibiting lexicographic preferences when all four
questions are answered correctly. This relationship, however, is statistically insignificant.
Similarly, there is a weak negative relationship between time spent on the survey and the
likelihood of answering lexicographically. Estimates also indicate older individuals and those
with less schooling are more likely to answer lexicographically.

19

Among the subsample with a nonperfect comprehension score, 31.9 percent of respondents answer
lexicographically.

4.4.4 Comparing Local and Nonlocal Cleanups
Respondents may exhibit different attitudes toward distributions of risks or income when
they are part of the affected scenario (see Clark and D’Ambrosio 2014 for a discussion about
reference groups and the veil of ignorance). We test this theory by presenting respondents with
two scenarios that each explicitly include or exclude them. Mean EDEs for the various survey
treatments are summarized in Table 12, along with the difference between the EDE in the
nonlocal setting (respondent does not live in the state) and the local setting (respondent does live
in the state).

responses.

Aggregating across all versions of the survey, there is no statistical difference in mean
EDEs for the two scenarios. Switching the order of the nonlocal and local cleanup scenarios
(version Order A), however, yields a significantly lower nonlocal mean EDE. On an individual
level, 327 respondents (35.8 percent) had different EDEs in the two sections. Although roughly a
third of the sample switched EDEs, 43.7 percent of respondents who switched changed their
EDE by only 1 cancer case per 1,000 residents. The direction of the switch is split: 158
respondents (17.3 percent) shifted to lower EDEs in the nonlocal section, and 169 (18.5 percent)
had lower EDEs in the local section. Figure 5 presents the difference between the two sections.
Individuals with consistent EDEs are not displayed.

Figure 5. Histogram of Difference between Local and Nonlocal EDEs

We analyze respondents’ open-ended responses in the local scenario to see whether
responses were self-interested or socially focused. In all, only 57 of the 913 respondents (6.2
percent) explicitly discussed their own risks as a motivation for their response. The remaining
individuals either made no mention of their own risks or stated their own risks were not relevant,
as in these examples:
•

•
•
•

“I’d love to be in region 1 and have my chances lowered to 1 but it’s only a 50/50 chance
and I would rather go with something that is 100 percent. I don’t letting [sic] betting on
my health. I am also very unlucky and assume that I would be in the second region.”
“I would want it equal spread between the two. I would be very angry if I lived in the one
that only got a partial clean up.”
“I don’t make decisions/vote just for me but for the best for the country or whatever
region or election I vote in. Everyone is in this together.”
“Even if I’m a part of the equation, I still believe in equality.”

We test whether individuals whose EDEs differ between sections are more or less likely
to cite their own risks in the open-ended responses. Whereas 3.9 percent of individuals in the
non-switching group mention their own risks, 10.1 percent of individuals who switch mention
28

their own risks. Those with higher EDEs in the local portion are 2.9 times more likely to mention
their own risk than non-switchers; respondents with higher EDEs in the nonlocal portion are 2.3
times more likely to mention their own risks. A small portion of respondents do seem affected by
their inclusion in the scenario. 20 The direction of the shift in EDEs is not consistent between
respondents, nor are most shifts large in magnitude.
4.4.5 Treatments
Comparing mean EDEs for each survey with the overall mean, we see some variation in
means between the treatments (Table 12). Specifically, it appears that the ordering of questions
has an effect on mean EDEs. Asking about local cleanups first (version Order A) yields a lower
nonlocal mean EDE than in the base survey. When respondents are first asked to consider a
situation with their own risks in play, they appear less likely to prefer equitable outcomes when
they are not affected by the results. This effect, however, is not statistically significant (p =
0.159).
The order in which leaky bucket questions are asked also appears to affect responses to
the health risk questions. When leaky bucket questions are asked before the health risk questions
(version Order B), mean EDEs for the health questions are higher than in other versions of the
survey. One likely reason for this is that the leaky bucket questions prepare respondents for
thinking about inequality. This could lead them to choose more equal health risk distributions.
4.4.6 Explaining Attitudes toward Inequality
As with the leaky bucket experiment, we first examine the relationship between health
risk inequality aversion and political leanings using mean EDEs. We then use interval regression
to explain health risk inequality choices for a variety of covariates, including political
identification. Table 13 presents the mean EDEs by political identification for non-lexicographic
respondents.

We also look at our “coin flip” questions, outlined above, to test whether attitudes toward monetary risk are
correlated with answers to the health questions. We find virtually no correlation between the answers to the coin flip
section and the two health sections.

Notes: Mean EDEs displayed are for nonlocal cleanups and exclude lexicographic
responses. EDEs are assumed to be at the midpoint of the respective interval, with
responses less than 3 coded as 2.5. The two means for liberal and conservative
respondents, marked with an asterisk, are statistically different using a t-test with unequal
variances (p = 0.0484).

Dividing all liberal respondents and all conservative respondents into two groups yields
means of 6.26 and 5.95, respectively. At the 5 percent level of significance, liberal respondents
are more likely to be inequality averse toward health risks than conservative respondents. The
associated Atkinson indices for each group are 0.25 and 0.19, respectively, implying a
willingness to increase the mean health risk by 25 percent (for liberals) and 19 percent (for
conservatives) if these risks are distributed equally in the population. Importantly, both groups
are inequality averse as a whole.
Table 14 summarizes our interval regression results for local and nonlocal EDEs.
Columns 1 and 3 present the base specifications before adding further controls. In our preferred
specifications, columns 2 and 4, we add political beliefs, presence of children in the household,
and whether the respondent belongs to an environmental organization.
Several demographic variables help explain respondents’ inequality aversion. Age has a
significant effect on EDEs: respondents over 45 years old have EDEs that are at least 1 cancer
case per 1,000 residents higher than individuals under 30. Men appear to be less inequality
averse than women. For nonlocal and local cleanups in our preferred specifications (columns 2
and 4), men have EDEs that are 0.394 and 0.659 lower than women when accounting for other
factors. This effect is significant only in the local case. Additionally, individuals with children
living in their household appear to be less inequality averse, preferring lower overall risks to
equal distributions with higher risks. Respondents’ race has no significant effect on inequality
aversion.

30

Surprisingly in light of the leaky bucket results, when we control for other covariates in
our interval regression, political beliefs seem to have no effect on inequality aversion.21
Belonging or donating to an environmental organization, however, has a slight negative effect on
respondents’ EDEs, meaning that these individuals prefer more cleanup to an equal cleanup. The
effect is not significant in the nonlocal scenario and is significant at the 10 percent level in the
local scenario.
The survey fixed effects reveal that the order of questions may affect responses to the
cleanup questions. In both the nonlocal and the local scenarios, asking the coin flip and leaky
bucket questions first increases the expected EDEs of respondents, meaning they prefer more
equality to more cleanup. Compared with the base survey, respondents receiving this version of
the survey have nonlocal and local EDES that are 0.645 and 0.640 higher, respectively. These
coefficients are significant at the 10 percent level. One plausible explanation for this pattern is
that the income inequality questions sensitize some respondents to be more concerned about
equality, which carries over to the health risk questions later in the survey.
We run these specifications a second time using only the respondents with nonlexicographic preferences. 22 These results are displayed in Table 15. The sample sizes in the
nonlocal and local contexts decrease from 912 respondents to 592 and 565, respectively. There
are several interesting changes. First, the effect of age on EDEs largely disappears, consistent
with the finding that age increases the likelihood of lexicographic responses. A weaker
relationship between age and inequality aversion does, however, hold in the nonlocal context.
Second, education becomes important in the local context, with respondents with higher
education levels preferring more equality. Finally, the effect of children in the household
decreases in magnitude and significance.

21

We have explored other specifications, including grouping political groups into larger bins. Our results on
political beliefs are robust to a range of specifications.
22
Our results are robust to restricting the sample to only respondents with perfect comprehension scores. There is an
overall lack of significance using this restriction as well.

5. Conclusion
The distributional effects of health and safety policies often receive less attention than the
monetized benefits of risk reductions stemming from these policies. We have argued that the
utility of a policy depends both on the mean health outcome in a population and on how it is
distributed. An Atkinson social welfare function for health risks could be used to evaluate
programs that affect how environmental health risks are distributed in society. Our goal in this
paper was to estimate the parameters of individuals’ SWFs defined over environmental health
risks.
Conducted in August 2015, our surveys include more than 900 respondents nationwide
and provide us with information on attitudes toward inequality aversion. We use the responses
from a series of dichotomous choice questions about hypothetical environmental cleanup
programs to parameterize an Atkinson SWF for health risks. Roughly 30 percent of our sample
exhibits lexicographic preferences in the context of health risks, preferring equal risk
distributions regardless of the effect on mean risks. Nearly half of the lexicographic respondents
explicitly rationalize their answers with references to equity and fairness. This group drives a
wedge between mean and median estimates of our inequality aversion parameter, 0.72 and 2.8,
respectively, implying modified Atkinson indices of 0.22 and 0.50. These values imply that
respondents would be willing to accept an increase in average risks of 22 percent (using the
mean inequality aversion parameter) and 50 percent (using the median inequality aversion
parameter) if the risks were equally distributed in the population.
We compare our health risk inequality results with our findings on income inequality
aversion. Using a “leaky bucket” experiment, we estimate mean and median income inequality
aversion parameters (ε) of 0.21 and 0.07. These relatively low values are in line with earlier
literature, including studies by Amiel et al. (1999) and Pirtillä and Uusitalo (2010). Our estimates
imply that respondents would be willing to accept a decrease in average income of 2.1 percent to
5.1 percent if the income were distributed evenly in the population. By asking questions related
to both income and health risks, we are able to conclude that respondents are significantly more
inequality averse in the context of health risks.

Appendix II. Survey Design Process
To arrive at our final survey design, we conducted a series of focus groups, one-on-one
interviews, and online pilot surveys.
Four focus groups were held at Resources for the Future in fall 2014 and spring 2015.
Advertisements were posted on Craigslist to generate a sample of hundreds of prospective
participants in the Washington, DC, area. The final 30 focus group participants made up a
roughly representative sample of US adults by age, race, gender, and education. Focus group
respondents were asked to complete a draft survey, discuss their answers, and comment on the
clarity of the questionnaire. Participants were compensated $75 for completing the two-hour
focus group.
After conducting the focus groups, we migrated the paper survey onto SurveyMonkey, an online
survey platform. SurveyMonkey features include questionnaire branching and question
randomization. SurveyMonkey distributes surveys to its panels of respondents. Prior to online
pilots, several one-on-one interviews with research assistants were conducted to test the
functionality of the online survey. Finally, we launched an online pilot to test SurveyMonkey’s
respondent panel on June 2, 2015 (N = 134). We found that the release of our pilot survey
induced answers primarily from respondents in the Eastern time zone and who were
predominately older and female.
The final survey distribution took place from Sunday, August 9, through Wednesday, August 12,
2015, using SurveyMonkey’s panel. Surveys were released at different days and times with the
goal of obtaining a more representative sample of internet users. SurveyMonkey incentivizes
respondents to answer surveys by offering entries into prize sweepstakes and donations to
various charities. Millions of people take SurveyMonkey surveys each month, and the service
conducts tests to ensure that members are representative of the US population. Nevertheless, as
shown in Table 2, respondents’ characteristics do not closely track national statistics for every
variable observed.

Environmental Clean-Ups

A state’s Department of Environmental Protection is considering two programs that will clean up pollution in
the state. You do not live in this state, nor do you know anyone who lives there. You will be asked to
consider both programs and to choose the one you think will do the state more good.
The two programs aim to reduce cancer risks resulting from environmental causes. There are many
cancer-causing substances in the environment, and in most cases people are not aware of them. We want
you to assume that people have certain cancer risks from exposure to these environmental pollutants and
nothing they do can change those risks. All of the residents in the state start out with the same risk of
cancer from environmental exposures.
However, the Department of Environmental Protection can reduce cancer risks by addressing pollution
sources in the state.

Base Health Risk Survey
Program Description

Before choosing a program, the Department will divide the state into two regions with identical populations
and demographics (e.g. income distribution, family size, race, etc):

Under Program A, one region would be selected randomly to have the majority of its pollution sources
cleaned up. Please assume that Region I is selected randomly, resulting in the majority of its pollution
sources being cleaned up. Region II would only have a few sources cleaned up. This clean-up method
would lead to Region I having lower final risks than Region II.
Under Program B, the state would select sources spread evenly across the entire state for clean-up.
Everyone in the state (both regions) would have their cancer risks reduced to the same level.
Please assume the two programs have identical costs and that no further clean-up will take place after the
chosen program is implemented.
The following questions will refer to "final" risks, which are the resulting cancer risks after a program has
been carried out.

Base Health Risk Survey

* Please recall that Program A (left) will clean up Region I more than Region II, while Program B (right) will
address pollution sources spread out evenly across both regions.

Based on the final risks shown in the graph and table, please indicate which program you advise
the Department to choose.
Program A
Program B

* Please explain the reasoning for your choice.

43

Base Health Risk Survey

* We would now like you to consider a very similar situation. The only difference is the final risks for Program
B. The final risks for both regions in Program B are now 6 cases per 1000 residents.

Based on the final risks shown in the graph and table, please indicate which program you advise
the Department to choose.

Section II

The second part of this survey is very similar to the first section. You will again be asked to choose
between programs that affect residents in an area of the country.
Now, please assume YOU live in the affected area. This means that the current pollution levels are
increasing your risk of cancer and the risks to others, and any clean-ups would reduce these risks. Recall
that it is difficult to know what pollutants are in the air you breathe. Because of this, it is impossible for
people, including you, to change their cancer risks from exposure to these environmental pollutants. All of
the residents in the area start out with the same cancer risks.
The Department of Environmental Protection will reduce cancer risks by addressing pollution sources in the
area.
The “area of the country” is undefined to prevent you from guessing who is in each Program Region. The
regions will again be split in a way that puts an equal number of residents in each region. The regions will
also have identical demographic make-ups. Please assume you do not know which region you live in.

Program Description

Before choosing a program, the Department will divide the area into two regions with identical populations
and demographics (e.g. income distribution, family size, race, etc).
Again, you do not know which region you are in.

The set-up here is the same as previously, in that:
Under Program A, one region would be selected randomly to have the majority of its pollution sources
cleaned up. Please assume that Region I is selected randomly, resulting in the majority of its pollution
sources being cleaned up. Region II would only have a few sources cleaned up. This clean-up method
would lead to Region I having lower final risks than Region II.
Under Program B, the Department would select sources spread evenly across the entire area for clean-up.
Both regions would have their cancer risks reduced to the same level.
Please assume the two programs have identical costs and that no further clean-up will take place after the
chosen program is implemented.

47

* Please recall that Program A (left) will clean up Region I more than Region II, while Program B (right) will
address pollution sources spread out evenly across both regions.
Please remember that you live in one of the two regions.

the Department to choose.

* We would now like you to consider a very similar situation. The only difference is the final risks for Program
B. The final risks for both regions in Program B are now 4 cases per 1000 residents.

Section III

The next few questions will ask you to make a choice between two options: receiving a certain amount of
money, or flipping a coin to determine how much money you receive. For each question, please select the
option you prefer.

* Consider a situation where you are presented with the following two options. Please select the option you
prefer.
You receive $10.
You flip a coin. If it shows heads, you receive $90. If it shows tails, you receive $10.

Section IV

* The following graph shows average household income in the United States in 2013 for the bottom 40% of
households and top 40% of households (the middle 20% are not shown). Each bar represents the same
number of households.

The bottom 40% of households earned income of $21,000 on average in 2013. The top 40% of households
earned $134,000 (on average) in the same year.
We would like you to consider the following thought experiment.Assuming you have the authority,
would you be willing to reduce the income of each household in the top 40% by $1000 to increase
the income of each household in the bottom 40% by $1000?
Yes
No

* Please explain your reasoning for this answer.
