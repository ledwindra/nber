    "abstract": "\n\nValue-added measures of teacher quality may be sensitive to the quantitative properties of the student tests upon which they are based.  This paper focuses on the sensitivity of value-added to test-score-ceiling effects.  Test-score ceilings are increasingly common in testing instruments across the country as education policy continues to emphasize proficiency-based reform.  Encouragingly, we show that over a wide range of test-score-ceiling severity, teachers' value-added estimates are only negligibly influenced by ceiling effects.  However, as ceiling conditions approach those found in minimum-competency testing environments, value-added results are significantly altered.  We suggest a simple statistical check for ceiling effects.\n\n",
