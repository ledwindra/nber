Does Decreased Access to Emergency Departments Affect Patient Outcomes? Analysis of
AMI Population 1996-2005

JEL No. I1,I11
ABSTRACT
We analyze whether decreased emergency department access (measured by increased driving time
to the nearest ED) results in adverse patient outcomes or changes in the patient health profile for patients
suffering from acute myocardial infarction. Data sources include 100% Medicare Provider Analysis
and Review, AHA hospital annual surveys, Medicare hospital cost reports, and longitude and latitude
information for 1995-2005. We define four ED access change categories and estimate a zip codes
fixed-effects regression models on the following AMI outcomes: time-specific mortality rates, age,
and probability of PTCA on the day of admission. We find a small increase in 30-day to 1-year mortality
rates among patients in communities that experience <10-minute increase in driving time. Among
patients in communities with >30-minute increases in driving time, we find a substantial increase in
long-term mortality rates, a shift to younger ages (suggesting that the older ones die en route) and
a higher probability of immediate PTCA. Most of the adverse effects disappear after the initial three-year
transition window.

Introduction
According to National Center for Health Statistics, the number of EDs decreased from 4176 to
3195 between 1995 and 2005, while annual ED visits increased from 96.5 million to 115.3
million during the same period (Nawar, Niska, and Xu 2007). This trend of decreasing ED
availability but increasing ED utilization continues even with the most recent data and has been
noted as a major issue facing the emergency care system in the US by the Institute of Medicine
(Institute of Medicine 2007; Niska, Bhuiya, and Xu 2010). There is a great deal of literature
documenting decreased access to emergency departments, as summarized in the Synthesis
Report by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Report by the Institute of Medicine(DeLia,
and Cantor 2009; Institute of Medicine 2007). While there are many anecdotal reports or singlehospital case studies suggesting the adverse effects of overcrowding and closures on patient care
(Adams, and Biros 2001; Hwang et al. 2006; Pines, and Hollander 2008; Pines et al. 2007),
however, there is little systematic empirical evidence to demonstrate these claims.
The principal objective of our research is to examine whether decreased ED access (measured
by increased driving time to the nearest ED) results in adverse patient outcomes or changes in
patient health profiles. We focus on acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients, a group that has
relatively homogenous patient characteristics and should be quite sensitive to the availability of
ED care. Specifically, we address the following research questions:
1. Does increased driving time to the nearest ED result in increased mortality rates among
AMI patients?
2. Does increased driving time to the nearest ED result in changes in health profile of AMI
patients who arrived alive in the hospital?
3. If decreased ED access has an adverse effect on patient outcomes, is the adverse effect

3

transitory or permanent?
The primary data sources for ED availability are the American Hospital Association annual
surveys and Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MedPAR) for 1995-2005. We identified
the AMI population by extracting from 100% MedPAR records. We link each patient’s zip code
with longitude and latitude coordinates using Mailer’s software(Mailer's Software 2006).
Finally, using the longitude and latitude coordinates of the hospital’s physical address or heliport
(if exist) (Horwitz, and Nichols 2009), we calculated driving time between each patient to the
nearest ED.
We expand the previous literature on ED access in several ways. First, we capture permanent
ED closure even in hospitals that did not close down. Second, we provide national estimates of
the effect of decreased ED access on patient outcomes. Third, we examine whether there are
changes in patient health profiles when distance to ED changes. Finally, we explore potential
temporal effects.

Background Literature
It is well-documented that the US has experienced decreases in access to emergency
departments, whether it be measured by closures of EDs or increasing hours that EDs are
temporarily closed to ambulance traffic due to overcrowding or lack of available resources
(California Medical Association 2001; DeLia, and Cantor 2009; Derlet 2002; Donovan 1991;
General Accounting Office 2001; Hart, Pirani, and Rosenblatt 1991; Lambe et al. 2002; Lambe
et al. 2003; Malone, and Dohan 2000; Melnick et al. 2004; Nawar et al. 2007; Niska et al. 2010;
Olshaker, and Rathlev 2006; Pitts et al. 2008; Schull et al. 2001; Sinay 1998; Sun et al. 2006).
While there is a growing body of research suggesting adverse effects of crowding and closures

4

on patient care, they are all based on data collected from single hospital settings (Bernstein et al.
2009; Fee et al. 2007; Hwang et al. 2006; Pines, and Hollander 2008; Pines et al. 2007). There
is little systematic empirical evidence to demonstrate these claims.
There have been a few studies that link decreased ED access to deterioration in process
measures for cardiac patients, none of which use nationally representative data. One study found
that ED crowding, as measured by patients’ perceived waiting time, is positively associated with
increased rates of patients who are left without being seen(Vieth, and Rhodes 2006). Schull and
colleagues found that simultaneous ambulance diversion at multiple EDs increased transport
times and total out-of-hospital interval delays for cardiac patients (Schull et al. 2003), and that
ED crowding is positively associated with increased time to thrombolytic for acute myocardial
infarction (Schull et al. 2004).
Besides the limited studies that link ED access to process measures, we are not aware of any
large-scale studies showing actual changes in patient outcomes due to changes in geographical
access to ED. There has been only one study that links hospital closures to health outcomes,
done in LA County between 1997 and 2003. This study showed that increased distance to the
closest hospital, regardless of whether the hospital offers ED services, were linked to increased
deaths from MI and unintentional injuries (Buchmueller, Jacobson, and Wold 2006).

Conceptual Framework
AMI is a time-sensitive illness. In our study, we focus on how changes in distance to the
closest ED affect health outcomes of AMI patients while taking into account whether the nearest
hospital has a cath capacity. For this paper, we obtain patient characteristics from the Medicare
inpatient claims, thereby focusing on AMI patients who survived their acute onset of AMI long

5

enough to generate a hospital admission record. The probability of surviving a heart attack long
enough to have a hospital admission record depends on several factors: age, the initial severity of
illness, and time to arrival at ED. There are several straightforward predictions when arrival is
delayed:
1.

When travel time increases, older patients are more likely than younger patients to have
died en route, holding all other factors constant.

2.

Severity of illness can increase with increased travel time, holding all other factors
constant.

3.

People with more severe cases of heart attack have lower probability of survival than
those with milder cases of heart attack, holding all other factors constant.

When the nearest ED is closed, it effectively delays arrival time to ED for such a patient. We
hypothesize that decreased ED access would affect our patient population in the following ways:
1.

Patients who survived to have hospital records would be younger in areas with decreased
ED access than those in areas with no decrease in ED access.

2.

The observed mortality rates of all AMI patients would increase when ED access
increases, but the observed mortality rates of patients who survived to have a hospital
record might not.

3.

Due to deterioration of condition associated with delayed TOA, patients in areas with
decreased ED access would arrive at the hospital with higher probability of needing a
procedure for immediate intervention.

Specifically, in our empirical model, we test these hypothesis by examining 3 types of AMI
outcomes: (1) time-specific mortality rates (7-day, 30-day, 90-day, 180-day, and 1-year
mortality), (2) age at the time of hospital admission, and (3) probability of receiving

6

percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) on the day of admission. Finally, there
is one additional factor that is likely to affect our hypotheses presented so far: the availability of
catheterization lab. The use of this technology is known to improve the health outcomes of AMI
patients.(Kontos et al. 2010; Stukel et al. 2007) Our empirical model will explicitly control for
the availability of cath lab in the nearest facility.

Study Design
Overview. We take a difference-in-differences approach to estimate the effect of ED closure
on AMI health outcomes. Consider the following hypothetical example between two groups of
patients:
AMI mortality rates

1995
1996
Difference-in-differences:

Time to ED does
not increase
between 1995 and
1996
14%
9%

Time to ED
increases between
1995 and 1996

Difference between
control and treatment
groups

16%
14%

2%
5%
5-2=3%

The 3% increase in AMI mortality in the above example can be attributed to ED closure while
accounting for secular trends (such as improvements in treatment and decreases in mortality of
AMI).(Gillum 1994; McGovern et al. 1996; Rosamond et al. 1998) More specifically, we
identify the effects of ED access by comparing outcomes of AMI population between the
following groups: (1) people who live in zip codes with no increase in driving time to their
closest ED (the control group); and (2) people who live in zip codes that experience <10, 10-30,
or >30 minute increases in driving time. These time thresholds were used based on knowledge
of the importance of timely care for AMI patients and the empirical distribution of the driving
time change. We implement zip codes fixed-effects models and include year dummies, full

7

interaction of patient demographics information and several risk adjustment variables as
available from claims data. We focus on the AMI population for several reasons. First, AMI
usually requires immediate medical attention; therefore patient selection into hospitals based on
health status or other unobservable characteristics is minimized. Second, because AMI is the
leading cause of death in the elderly population, the substantial amount of claims data for this
condition allows us to generate more robust findings. Third, AMI is a condition that is sensitive
to the availability of ED care.
Data Sources and Patient Population. The primary data sources for ED availability are
the American Hospital Association annual surveys. Because AHA data is based on self-report
and may be prone to reporting errors, we modified the AHA data the following ways: (1) we use
California OSHPD facility data, an administrative database, to verify ED status for California
hospitals; and (2) When hospitals did not report whether they offered a service in a given year,
we impute the values using information from adjacent years. Patient data, including patient’s
mailing zip codes, were obtained from MedPAR. We link each patient’s zip code with longitude
and latitude coordinates of each zip code using Mailer’s software.(Mailer's Software) Finally,
using the longitude and latitude coordinates of the hospital’s physical address or heliport (if
exist) we calculated driving time between each patient to the nearest ED.
We identified the AMI population by extracting from 100% MedPAR records that has
410.x0 or 410.x1 as the principal diagnoses between 1995 and 2005. We apply several exclusion
criteria to the patient sample. First, we follow McClellan et al’s exclusion criteria to minimize
selection bias (McClellan, McNeil, and Newhouse 1994). While the exclusion list is extensive,
we highlight two important criteria here: we exclude transfers and patients who had a prior AMI
admission within the past 12 months. We apply additional exclusion criteria pertinent to our

8

study. First, we exclude 23 percent of the patient population who were not admitted through the
ED, since direct admission to ED is the relevant population based on our conceptual framework
that relates driving time changes to health outcome changes, and because cardiac patients
directly admitted to the hospital (e.g., who present to their primary care physician’s office and
are admitted through their physician, bypassing the ED) are likely different in terms of severity
from those admitted via the ED. Second, we exclude 11 percent of patients whose admitted
hospital is more than 100 miles away from their mailing zipcodes, as those patients are likely not
reside in their mailing address or were admitted to hospitals while away from home. Third, we
exclude zip codes that experience multiple changes in distance to their closest ED during the
study period (3 percent of the sample) as these patients do not represent patients who have
experienced a single change and would not contribute to answering the original research
question. Finally, we exclude zip codes that do not have patients both before and after the access
change occurred (1 percent). The final sample consists of approximately 150,000 patients per
year from 1996 to 2005 for a total sample size of 1.49 million patient-year observations.i

Methods
Defining AMI Outcomes. We examine the following health characteristics of AMI
population: mortality rates of different time horizon (7-day, 30-day, 90-day, 180-day, and 1year), age at the time of hospital admission, and whether the patient underwent PTCA on the day
of admission. The three types of outcomes allow us to explicitly test the hypotheses set forth in
the conceptual framework.
Defining Changes in Access to ED between 1996 and 2005. In this study, our key variable
of interest is each patient’s time to the nearest ED and, more importantly, whether patients reside

9

in locations where driving time to ED has increased during the study period. We first calculated
the distance between each zip code to the nearest ED using the population centroid location of
the zip code, separately for each year.ii The distance calculation based on longitude and latitude
coordinates is highly correlated with actual driving distance.(Love 1979; Phibbs, and Luft 1995)
Next, we computed the change in distance between adjacent years for each zip code community.
To give a better sense of the extent of change each zip code faces and to provide clarity in
presenting the multivariate results, we translated changes in distance to changes in driving time
using the formula by Phibbs and Luft.(Phibbs 2008; Phibbs, and Luft 1995) Finally, we
classified the communities according to whether the driving time between a community and the
nearest ED satisfied the following condition between 1996 and 2005: (1) did not increase (the
control group); (2) increased by less than 10 minutes; or (3) increased by 10-30 minutes; and (4)
increased by more than 30 minutes. We divided the treatment groups into the above three
categories for easier interpretation of results and to allow for the possibility that the effect might
not be linear over travel time. The fixed-effects model effectively compares the outcome
differences before and after the driving time increase occurs among patients in the treatment
group to the change in outcome across years among patients in the control group.
Statistical Methods. We estimate the effect of increased driving time to ED as follows:
Yijt   t  1 Inc10 jt   2 Inc10_30 jt   3 Incgt30 jt   4 cath jt   5 Xijt   6Wit  Z j   ijt

(1)

10

where
Yijt = health outcome of patient i residing in zip code j in year t

α t = year indicator
Inc10 jt =1 for zip code j on and after year t if time to closest ED increases
by less than 10 minutes in year t; 0 otherwise.
Inc10_30 jt =1 for zip code j on and after year t if time to closest ED increases
by 10-30 minutes in year t; 0 otherwise.
Incgt30 jt =1 for zip code j on and after year t if time to closest ED increases
by at least 30 minutes in year t; 0 otherwise.
cath jt =1 if the closest ED in zipcode j has cath lab available in year t; 0 otherwise.
Xijt = a vector of demographics and comorbidity variables of patient i.
Wit = a vector of hospital characteristics of patient i's admitted hospital.
Z j = zip-codes fixed effects.
We estimate model (1) separately for the health outcomes described above. For the mortality
and PTCA variables, we use a linear probability model with zip codes fixed effects. Even
though the natural choice of estimating a dichotomous dependent variable is a probit or logit
model, these models might result in inconsistent estimator, because we are including significant
number of zip code fixed effects (Buchmueller et al. 2006). The linear probability models can
consistently estimate the effect of changes in driving time on these mortality outcomes and
require substantially less computing time (Greene 2002). For age, a continuous variable, we use
least square fixed-effects models to estimate the effect of ED access on age.
In model (1), the year indicator would capture the macro trends of the AMI mortality from
1996 to 2005. The zip codes fixed effects control for any unobserved time-invariant
heterogeneity across zip codes (including any inherent differences in baseline mortality rates
across communities). The variables of interest are the three access change indicators
(Inc10,Inc10_30 and Incgt30) that capture the difference-in-differences estimators. Using the
model with 7-day mortality rates as an example, the coefficient on Inc10 indicates that the AMI

	  

11	  

7-day mortality rates have changed by 1 percentage point after driving time to the nearest ED in
the patients whose zip codes increased by <10 minutes compared to the control group; likewise
for 2 and 3.iii The control variables, X’s, include fully interacted patient demographic covariates (5-year age groups, gender, white, black or other race, counts of comorbidities, and
urban or rural residence). In the model where age is the outcome of interest, we do not include
age groups when constructing the fully interacted patient demographic covariates. We define zip
codes as in urban area if it belongs to a Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA). We also include a
list of disease related risk adjustment following Skinner and Staiger (2008); specifically, if
patients have peripheral vascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, dementia, chronic renal
failure, diabetes, liver disease, or cancer at the time of admission. Last we include hospital
organizational characteristics of the admitted hospital, including hospital ownership (for-profit,
government) and size (measured by log transformed total inpatient discharges). For all models,
we estimate robust standard errors that allow for intra-zipcode correlation among patients who
belong to the same zip code.
When the nearest EDs were closed, patients might only experience temporary adverse effect
of the closure, as communities might be able to realign their resources to compensate for the ED
closure. In addition, the AHA reporting period for each hospital varies for a given annual
survey—a hospital that indicate it no longer offers ED in the 2003 survey might in fact closed
the service sometime in 2002. It is also possible that an ED that closed might already experience
difficulties in providing care due to reasons that eventually led to its closure (e.g., lack of
available resources) a few years before closure occurred. In model 2, we investigate the
potential transitory effect by adding transition indicators. Specifically, for each ED access
change category, we allow the effects to differ by the following transition year indicators: 2-3

12

years before the access change, 1 year before to 1 year after the change, 2-3 years after the
change, and 4 or more years after the change.
We estimate our models on two samples: on the whole sample and on patients whose zip
codes have no more than 2 hospitals within 10-mile radius (about 30 minute drive time) in the
baseline. Large increases in driving time are more likely to occur in areas with limited access to
hospitals. Comparing patient outcomes in those communities directly to the general AMI
population may not be fair comparison. The two sets of analysis would allow us to examine
whether the results are robust to differences in baseline access to hospitals.

Results
We find that 89.2% of the study population did not experience increased driving times to
their nearest ED during the study period. Figure 1 shows that shares of patients that experienced
<10, 10-30, and >30 minute increase in driving time were 8.9, 1.7, and 0.2%, respectively. To
delineate which zip codes are affected by the increased driving time, we show the ED access
change categories on a US map in Figure 2. As the figure shows, large increases tend to occur
in mountainous or desert regions.
Figure 3 displays the year trend in four AMI outcomes (7-day, 30-day mortality rates,
average age, and share receiving PTCA on the day of admission) between 1996 and 2005. In
general, AMI mortality rates have decreased over this time period, consistent with previous
literature. There is an increasing trend in the average age of our study population (by about 2.5
years), as well as increased share of patients receiving PTCA on the day of admission (from 5
percent to 17 percent).

13

Figures 4-5 compare the unadjusted trends by the 4 ED access change categories.
Because each affected community experiences access change in a different year and we have
shown in Figure 3 that trends in all outcomes do not stay flat, we normalize the trend and show
the “relative” trend where the average value for each year is normalized to be zero. In other
words, a hospital whose 7-day mortality rate is below national average for a given year would
have a negative value. In these two graphs, the X-axis represents the relative year to when the
access change occurred (for a zipcode that experience access change in 1998, year 0 would be
1998, and year -1 would be 1997). By construction, the control group is represented by the flat
line at zero across all years. As an example, for 7-day mortality rates (Figure 4, left panel), the
group of patients that experience less than a 10-minute or 10-30 minute increase in driving time
(red and green dashed line) have mortality rates similar or slightly below that of the control
group. Among patients with >30 minute increase in driving time, 7-day mortality rates trend
upward two years prior to the access change and then trend downward the year after the change
occurred. The trend in age profile (Figure 5, left panel) also shows an interesting pattern among
the communities with >30 minute increase: the baseline average age tends to be younger than
that in the control group; age exhibits a decreasing trend 1 years prior to the change and bounce
back to a similar age level as the baseline 2 years after change occurred. It should be noted that
because the smallest sample size is in the >30 minute category (sample size shown at the bottom
of Table 1), the trend is not as smooth as the other access change categories. The opposite
pattern is observed for share of patients receiving PTCA on the day of admission: the share
spikes upward for this access category two years prior to the access change and return to baseline
level two years after the change. The fixed-effects models control for the baseline differences in

14

outcome across the four groups of ED access change, since our identification comes from
comparing within-group changes in outcome between treatment and control groups.
Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of the independent variables by the four ED
access change categories. For the control group (patients in zip codes with no increased driving
time), we show the average values over all years; for the three treatment groups, we show the
average values before the access change occurred. In general, patient and hospital characteristics
do not appear to differ much across the access categories except for the following: As expected,
patients who experience large increase in driving time are mostly in rural communities (among
for those with a >30 minute increase, only 17 percent are in zipcodes that belong to a MSA).
Their access to hospitals is also more limited: the average number of hospitals within 10-mile
radius in the control group is 2.57 compared to 1.03 hospitals among patients who experience
greater than a 30-minute increase in driving time.
Table 2 presents the fixed-effects results for model 1. The top panel shows the results of
the overall Medicare AMI ED population. For moderate increases in driving time (under 30
minutes), there appear to be no differences in mortality rates (full regression results are available
upon request), with one exception: for patients in communities with a <10-minute increase in
driving time, 180-day mortality rate rose by 0.6 of one percentage point (p<0.10). The last row
of top panel shows that having a catheterization lab in the nearest facility appears to lower the 7day and 30-day mortality rates by 0.5 of one percentage point, but such an improvement in
mortality rates disappear when looking at longer time horizon. For patients with >30 minutes
increase in driving time, the adverse effect appears when we examine long-term mortality:
overall 180-day and 1-year mortality rates increased by 5 percentage points. The bottom panel of
Table 2 reports the results limiting the sample to those patients with access to 2 or fewer

15

hospitals within 10-mile radius in the baseline. The adverse effects on mortality rates become
magnified across all time horizons for patients facing a <10-minute increase in driving time.
Specifically, relative to the control group, the mortality rates among this group of patients
increased by 1-2 percentage points after the access change occurred. The positive and significant
increase persists when we look examine at longer time horizon (up to 1 year after admission).
The rest of the results on mortality rates for the other two ED access change categories are
similar to the top panel.
The last two columns of Table 2 show the results on age and probability of receiving
PTCA on the day of admission. The results are similar whether we look at the whole sample or
the sample with limited baseline access. For the patients experience a >30-minute increase in
driving time, the effect is consistent with the conceptual framework—the average age declined
by 0.8 years but there were no observed differences in the probability of receiving PTCA. For
patients that experience a less than 10 minute increase in driving time, the probability of
receiving PTCA dipped by about 0.6-0.9 of one percentage point.
Table 3 shows the estimated effects from model 2 where we add transition indicators for
each access change categories. Results from this table show how the effects of the transition
years can be masked when we only look at the overall effect as in Table 2. For clarity of
presentation, we report only the results of the second sample where we limit patients to those
with at most 2-hospital access within 10-mile radius at the baseline since this sample represents a
more comparable control group (whole sample results are available upon request). Recall in
Table 2 we saw increased mortality rates among patients in areas with a <10-minute increase in
driving time after the access change took place. Table 3 suggests that most of those adverse
effects are transitory: the adverse effect peaks mostly one year before the access change occurred

16

(1.5-3 percentage points, depending on the time horizon), persists at a similar level up to 3 years
after the change, but gradually decreases its magnitude when we look beyond the initial 3-year
window. The results on age shows that the temporary increase in mortality rates is not due to
changes in patient population age—there is no difference in age between control group and this
group during the initial 3-year window, although the average went up slightly (by 0.4 of one
year) beyond this window.
Similar to model 1, we do not find any noticeable increase in mortality rates or transition
effect on age and probability of receiving PTCA among patients experiencing 10-30 minute
increase in driving time. For patients living in communities that experience a >30 minute
increase in driving time, we observe an alarming trend in long-term mortality rates. The oneyear mortality rates is increased by 5.6 percentage points during the initial transition years, and
such increase did not go away—the increase in 1-year mortality rates persists and goes up to
almost 8 percentage points when we look beyond the first three years.
The last two columns of Table 3 shows that the drop in average age that we observed in
Table 2 is temporary. The average age dropped by one year only during the initial transition
time (from 1 year before to 1 year after the change occurred). Similarly, the share of patients
receiving PTCA on the day of admission only temporarily increased by 3.9 percentage points
during that window.
Sensitivity analysis. As we discussed in the conceptual framework, our sample includes only
people who have an inpatient claim (this includes patients who have been admitted to the ED
first and then later admitted to the hospital). Our sample does not include patients who died
upon arrival or in the ED—those people would only have outpatient record. We obtained
authorization to access 3 years of outpatient records (1996, 2000, and 2005) and we explore a

17

few issues related to this excluded group. First, we found that less than 7 percent of the AMI
population has outpatient claims only. Second, this group tends to have much higher mortality
rates than the patients that eventually were admitted to the hospital: their average in-hospital
mortality rate is 22 percent in 1996 compared to 14 percent in the main sample. When we added
this group to our original sample, the pattern we observe in Figures 4-5 remain similar, and our
conclusions on the key ED access change variables remain the same.
Our main model only includes people who were admitted directly to the ED. In another
sensitivity analysis, we include all patients, and our conclusion remains similar with one
important difference: when examining the whole AMI population, we do not observe increased
long-term mortality rates among patients facing >30-minute increase in driving time (perhaps not
surprisingly, those who were admitted to the ED has a higher mortality rates on average than the
whole sample).

Discussion
Hospital-based emergency departments are, as stated by the Institute of
Medicine(Institute of Medicine 2007), at a breaking point, with increasing ED utilization and
decreasing number of EDs available. In this paper, we assemble a longitudinal national dataset
to address one of the key issues regarding the relationship between ED access and patient
outcomes. Our empirical results provide the first national estimates of the effect of ED access on
health outcomes for the AMI population and can be summarized as follows: First, ED access
deterioration, as measured by increased driving time to the nearest ED, affects less than 11
percent of the population. Second, small increases in driving time (under 10 minutes) have a
small adverse effect on mortality rates, and the magnitude of the effect is greater for those with

18

limited access to hospitals at baseline. Third, large increases in driving time (over 30 minutes)
increase the observed long-term mortality rates and also change the health profile of the admitted
patients (such as younger age, and faced with higher probability of receiving PTCA on the day of
admission). Last, the observed adverse effects are mostly temporary: all outcomes return to
similar levels as the pre-change period beyond the initial three-year transition window, except for
long-term mortality rates for those facing >30-minute increase—the effect lingers and becomes
stronger when looking beyond the transition window.
It is important to recognize that we focus exclusively on geographic access alone and its
effect on patient outcomes. While this is an important aspect of access especially for illness
where time is critical, there are other ED access issues that we cannot address in this study, such
as financial or cultural barriers.iv Persons in communities with “easy” geographic access to ED
might still experience worse outcomes if other barriers worsen over time.
The study has several limitations. First, our distance variable is based on the longitude and
latitude information of the ZIP code’s population center. Even though this distance measure is
highly correlated with driving distance,(Phibbs, and Luft 1995) two people from the same zip
code might have very different access to the same ED, especially in rural areas. A related
concern is that the zip code on file is based on mailing zip code, which might not reflect the
actual residence. While there is no one variable from the Medicare claims that can identify
patients who were treated for AMI away from home or whose residence is different from mailing
address, we took the standard approach and applied an exclusion criteria of dropping 11 percent
of patients whose admitted hospital is more than 100 miles away from his zip code.
Second, we identify the nearest ED using multiple sources to minimize reporting errors and
we err on the side of conservative. However, it is inevitable that some errors will remain. As

19

long as the errors do not systematically differ by the access categories we examined, we do not
expect to have a bias in our estimated ED access effect. Third, our patient population consists of
Medicare patients who are not in managed care plans, since MedPAR is the only source of data
with reliable outcome information at the national level for multiple years. Patient characteristics
might have changed within this sample as more elderly are moved into managed care settings
(i.e., those remained in the sample are sicker and older over time). We believe the movement to
managed care would have a minimal impact on our estimated ED access effect, since there is no
evidence to suggest that such movement is systematically linked to changes in area ED access.
Fourth, our data does not allow us to capture quality of pre-hospital care (i.e., care of the
patient by paramedics in the ambulance en route to the hospital). If changes in the quality of
EMS care varied systematically with changes in ED availability, our estimation would be biased.
However, we are not aware of studies that show such a relationship and studies looking at skill
levels of pre-hospital in the US generally did not find much differences in outcome for cardiac
patients (Guly et al. 1995; Mitchell et al. 1997; Nguyen-Van-Tam et al. 1997; Rainer, Marshall,
and Cusack 1997). The EMS community acknowledges that delays to the ED are detrimental,
and we capture that dimension by using driving time as the proxy. Fifth, we were not able to
differentiate between the more severe cases of AMI (ST-elevation MI, or “STEMI”), where
immediate access to cath/angioplasty is critical(Boersma et al. 1996), from other AMI cases,
because the diagnostic code for STEMI was officially assigned only after October 2005. It is
likely that the adverse effects we observe might be of higher magnitude for STEMI.
Sixth, we are unable to ascertain whether the closed hospitals are systematically different in
quality than those that remain opened. Previous literature suggests that there are a wide variety
of reasons for closure,(Bromberg 1983; Chapman 1990; Kennedy, and Dumas 1983; Lillie-

20

Blanton et al. 1992; Lynn, and Wertheim 1993; McNeil, and Williams 1978; Mullner, and
McNeil 1986; Topping 1991; Whiteis 1992). It is very possible that ED closures were due to
smaller or poorer-performing hospitals. Given this, however, our findings would be conservative
since mortality would be biased downward if better hospitals preferentially survived. Similarly,
while PTCA was used as a proxy for more severe illness due to delay in ED arrival, it is possible
that the rates of PTCA were higher in patients who traveled further because their next available
ED is a higher-volume, more tertiary center where PTCA was available and therefore utilized.
However, our results show that the increase in PTCA is only temporary (also, our model controls
for availability of catheterization lab), whereas we would expect the PTCA rate to persist at a
higher level if the increased PTCA rate were due to better access to catheterization lab as a result
of the nearby closure.
Our findings raise several important issues regarding the resource allocation of the
emergency care system in general. While worse geographic access can cause a delay in care, it
is not the only contributing factor. Our findings of adverse effects on mortality rates among
communities experience only a small increase in driving time may indicate potential problems
facing the remaining nearby hospitals when one ED closes. These affected communities are
mostly in urban settings with dense population where the EDs are already experiencing
overcrowding. The influx of patients the remaining hospitals have to absorb is likely to
exacerbate the overcrowding conditions in their EDs (as shown in other studies, such as Sun et al
2006(Sun et al. 2006) and Dombrosk and Tracy 1978 (Dombrosk, and Tracy 1978) and can
potentially cause the observed spike in mortality rates. But it appears that these communities’
ED systems were able to realign their resources eventually, since the adverse effect went away
after the initial three-year transition window.

21

Even though only a very small segment of the population experienced a large increase in
driving time to the nearest ED, the adverse effect of ED access deterioration shows up in
multiple dimensions. Unlike the communities with small increase in driving time where all
adverse effects disappear beyond the first three years, the increase in long-term mortality rates
for this segment of the population is substantial and persistent. The drop in average age among
the admitted patients is consistent with our conceptual framework that predicts that patients in
these communities who survived to have hospital records are younger than those in the control
group, since the older patients are more likely to die en route given the large increase in driving
time. In an exploratory analysis, we also noted that number of AMI hospital admissions for this
group dropped relative to the other treatment and control groups during the transition years, an
observation consistent with the conceptual framework. This implies that the true effect on
mortality rates is even larger, when we take into account the deaths from this segment of the
patients that can potentially be prevented in the absence of the large increase in driving time. In
addition, the implications for medical costs and loss of quality of life may not be trivial when we
consider that those who experience large increases in driving time have a higher probability of
receiving PTCA immediately compared to the control group during the transition years. The
deterioration in condition might have been prevented in the absence of such change of access.
As we discussed earlier, the adverse effects we estimated should be considered the lower
bound of the true effect because we only observe patients who survive to have a hospital record.
Future research to confirm these findings would require capturing a more comprehensive patient
population, as well as better adjustment for clinical illness (which are limited in administrative
datasets). Such knowledge is critical to validate the effects of such decreased availability of
services on patient outcomes. In addition, there are other conditions where time is critical and

22

affects a larger segment of the population (such as severe cases of asthma, sepsis, or trauma).
Examining these conditions could reveal different issues regarding the role of ED access on
patient outcomes, and provide additional insight on the best practice of resource allocation to
optimize emergency care services as a whole.
Overall, there is reason to be optimistic: almost all of the adverse effects disappear after
four years. ED closure, and the accompanied change in access for the affected population, is not
necessarily detrimental if the closure allows patients to get to better quality hospitals that have
the capacity to absorb the additional patient load. Our results suggest that policy planners can
minimize the adverse effects during the transition years by facilitating the realignment of health
care resources during this critical period. Potential solutions might involve providing assistance
to ensure adequate capacity of remaining operating EDs in the area before the closure even took
place, and improved coordination among the various EMS players.

i

1995 was not used in the analysis because it was used to exclude patients from 1996 who had
prior AMI admissions.
ii
We used the population centroid of 2000 for the calculation.
iii
Because the AHA reporting period for each hospital varies for a given annual survey, we turn
the access change indicator to one the year before the hospital said it closes the ED (i.e., a
hospital that indicate it no longer offers ED in the 2003 survey might in fact close the service
sometime in 2002).
iv
Waiting time, while an important issue for patients with non-urgent conditions, is unlikely a
cause of delay for AMI patient. Chest pain patients presenting to the ED are prioritized in triage
and in almost all hospitals receive an electrocardiogram while in triage.
