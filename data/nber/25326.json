    "abstract": "\n\nDistributional decisions regularly involve multiple payo\ufb00 components. In a series of experiments involving over 3,300 subjects and 81,000 decisions, we \ufb01nd that\u2014even when payo\ufb00 components can be easily aggregated\u2014many subjects exhibit narrow equity concerns, applying fairness preferences to a single component of payo\ufb00s. This behavior leads to preference reversals; subjects make di\ufb00erent choices depending on which payo\ufb00 component is used to denominate their decision. In our simplest setting, in which the two payo\ufb00 components are small and large tokens, displaying narrow equity concerns is 63%\u201383% as prevalent as achieving equity in total payo\ufb00s and just as prevalent as applying the well-documented norm of a 50/50-split. Subjects also exhibit narrowly equity concerns over payo\ufb00s of time and money.\n\n",
