    "abstract": "\n\nI describe the challenge of fully integrating securities markets in Europe by integrating the clearing and settlement functionalities.  The initial condition is characterized by a multitude of standards, conventions, regulation and laws, which are inconsistent with a barrier-free post-trading environment.  In addition, the current providers of post-trading services are mostly for-profit monopolies.  The EU reform strategy is discussed in detail, and its performance so far is assessed.  I argue that the special features of the post-trading industry may help understand the disappointing progress so far.\n\n",
