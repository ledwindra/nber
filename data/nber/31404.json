    "abstract": "\n\nMarried couples filing a joint return put the male name first 88.1% of the time in tax year 2020, down from 97.3% in 1996. The man\u2019s name is more likely to go first the larger is the fraction of the couple\u2019s allocable income that goes to him, and the older is the couple. Based on state averages, putting the man\u2019s name first is strongly associated with conservative political attitudes, religiosity, and a survey-based measure of sexist attitudes. Risk-taking and tax noncompliance are both associated with the man\u2019s name going first.\n\n",
