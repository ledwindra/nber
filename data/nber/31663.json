    "abstract": "\n\nWe study the evolution of belief systems that suppress productive effort, including beliefs about envy, the importance of luck for success, witchcraft beliefs, and disdain for competitive effort. Demotivating beliefs evolve when interactions are zero-sum. They improve short-run material welfare by limiting excessive competition but reduce long-run growth. Demotivating beliefs also drive a wedge between how well people do and how well they think they do. Whereas material welfare is hump-shaped in demotivating beliefs, subjective well-being is decreasing. These predictions are supported by data from two samples in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the World Values Survey.\n\n",
