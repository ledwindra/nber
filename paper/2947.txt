EQUILIBRIUM EXCHANGE RATE HEDGING

ABSTRACT

a one-period model where each investor consumes a
single good, and where borrowing and lending are private and real,
there is a universal constant that tells how much each investor hedges
his foreign investments. The constant depends only on average risk
tolerance across investors. The same constant applies to every real
foreign investment held by every investor. Foreign investors are those
with different consumption goods, not necessarily those who live in
different countries. In equilibrium, the price of the world market
portfolio will adjust so that the constant will be related to an average
of world market risk premia, an average of world market volatilities,
and an average of exchange rate volatilities, where we take the
averages over all investors. The constant will not be related to
exchange rate means or covariances. In the limiting case when
exchange risk approaches zero, the constant will be equal to one
minus the ratio of the variance of the world market return to its
mean. Jensen's inequality, or "Siegel's paradox," makes investors
want significant amounts of exchange rate risk in their portfolios. It
also makes investors prefer a world with more exchange rate risk to a
similar world with less exchange rate risk.

INTRODUCTION
Solnik (1974), Grauer, Litzenberger, and Stehle (1976), Sercu (1980). Stulz (1981).
Adler and Dumas (1983), and Trevor (1986) have equilibrium models of
international investment in equities or real assets. Ross and Walsh (1983) have a
similar model for individuals in a single country with their own price indexes. Each
of their models assumes that the typical investor in each country consumes a single
good or basket of goods. All but Solnik find that investors will hold shares of a
single world market portfolio of real assets.

In fact, when all borrowing and lending is real, they find that every investor will
hold a mix of a "universal logarithmic portfolio" with domestic lending. where the
universal logarithmic portfolio may include foreign borrowing or lending along with
the world market portfolio of real assets.

This result leads directly to one result we give below: that there is a universal
constant giving the fraction that each investor hedges of his investments in foreign
real assets.
In contrast, most people who have looked at exchange rate hedging, like Adler and
Dumas (1984), Adler and Simon (1986), Eun and Resnick (1988). Thomas (1988)
and Perold and Schulman (1988), have noted that the best hedge depends on mean
changes in exchange rates and on covariances of exchange rate changes with one
9

another and with asset returns. Their results are correct, but do not make full use
of the equilibrium conditions. Roll and Solnik (1977) have used those conditions to
explore the relation between mean changes in exchange rates and covariances in an
equilibrium model like Solnik's.
AN EQUILIBRIUM MODEL

Let's imagine a world where all investors in a single country consume the same
good. The technology is such that at each moment, any consumption good may be
converted to any other consumption good at a fixed exchange rate. Future exchange
rates are uncertain.
An asset may pay off in any combination of goods. An investor will use the
technology to convert the goods he receives into the good he consumes. Or he may
trade the goods he receives for the one he consumes. Assets are not associated with
the countries, so we will not distinguish domestic and foreign assets.
Investors create real borrowing and lending in each good. There is no government,
so all borrowing and lending is private. Investors create exchange rate contracts by
borrowing in one good and lending in another.

This world will last only one infinitesimal period, so we may treat returns on all
assets and contracts as following a joint normal distribution. An investor wants to
minimize the variance of his portfolio return for a given mean return.

The key to our result is that every investor holds the same portfolio of risky assets,
including both equities and foreign borrowing or lending. We also use the fact that
borrowing and lending is private, so one person's lending must be another person's
borrowing.

Write a, for the fraction of world wealth held by investors who consume good i
and b for the fraction of real assets such as common stocks held by investors who
consume good i . Even though different investors use different units of account,
they all come up with the same values for these fractions. Total world wealth is
equal to total world assets.

Write Cj for gross domestic lending by investors who consume good i , again
expressed as a fraction of world wealth. When an investor lends, investors in other
countries borrow in relation to their holdings of all risky assets. We will even
assume that an investor borrows a similar share of his own lending. Thus his net
lending in his own good is less than his gross lending.

Since each investor holds the same share of all risky assets, and even the same share
of riskiess gross domestic borrowing, we can say that borrowing in good j by
3

investors who consume good i is bc, . When

j = i , this refers to gross

borrowing, not net borrowing.
bc , expressed
An investor in good i will have total gross borrowing equal to
as a fraction of world wealth or world assets. Since gross lending is Cj , his net
lending is Cj — , bc, . But his net lending must equal his wealth minus his real
assets, since all borrowing is private.

a—b1 =cj—Ebic,

(1)

We assume the fractions a and b, of world wealth and world assets are both
given, though the asset fractions b1 will depend in turn on investor risk
preferences. Thus equation (1) gives a separate equation for each good i . These
equations help specify the gross lending fractions 4
Summing equation (1) over i gives an identity, since the fractions a, and b,
both sum to 1.0. The equations are not independent, so the solution is not unique.
In fact, a general solution to the equations in (1) is:

cj=a—Ab1

(2)

In other words, the investor lends his wealth less a multiple of his holdings of real
assets. The multiple A is the same for all investors. Summing over investors, we
see that 1 — A is equal to total gross lending for the world, expressed as a fraction
of world wealth. It need not be positive: it can also be zero or negative.

We can also interpret 1 — A as the amount of hedging each investor does for his
foreign investments. A zero value for A represents 100% exchange rate hedging for
foreign real investments. Gross borrowing will then be:

bc=b(1—A)
I

(3)

In other words, gross borrowing when A is zero will equal investment in real
assets. When A is zero, we have 100% hedging of foreign investments. When A
4

is one, we have no hedging of foreign investments. When A is greater than one, we
have, negative hedging: investors add to the exchange risk in their foreign
investments. Whatever the level of hedging, it applies equally to investors all over
the world, even though they vary in wealth and risk tolerance, and even though the
expected exchange rate changes and the covariances between exchange rate changes
and asset returns will differ across investors.
A SIMPLE EXAMPLE
To understand why investors will bear some exchange rate risk in equilibrium, let's
study a simple symmetric world with two investors and two goods.
Investor 1 consumes good 1, and investor 2 consumes good 2. Investors are endowed
with equal amounts of goods 1 and 2 at the horizon.

The exchange technology at the horizon will let investors change from one good to
the other at the prevailing exchange rate. The exchange rate will be 2:1 or 1:2 with
equal probability.

The investors can trade their endowments one-for-one at the start of the period so
that each holds only claims on the good he consumes. Thus each investor can hold a
riskiess position.
But the payoff from holding the other good is substantial. The expected payoff from
holding one unit of the foreign good unhedged is the average of 2.0 and 0.5, or 1.25
units of the domestic good. Everything is symmetric, so each investor gains in
expected return (and in risk), from holding some of the foreign good. An investor
always gains in expected utility from taking some amount of risk when he faces a
positive expected payoff from risk-taking.

Note that the gain in expected return comes entirely from Jensen's inequality or
Siegel's (1972, 1975) "paradox." It comes from the difference between the expected
value of an inverse and the inverse of expected value. It is substantial, even though
it comes from a fact often thought to have mathematical significance but not
economic significance. For example, see McCulloch (1975) and Roper (1975).
Krugznan (1981) and Frankel (1986) show that Siegel's paradox is economically
significant in a model more general than this example.
Note also that each investor gains from the existence of exchange rate risk. Both
prefer this world to an otherwise identical world where the exchange rate at the
horizon will be 1:1 for sure. Similarly, they will have a still stronger preference for a
world where the exchange rate will be 3:1 or 1:3 with equal probability.

A GENERAL CASE

We will assume that there are no taxes or other barriers to international investment
or disinvestment. When such barriers exist, they will generally cause investors to
move away from a world market portfolio and toward a domestic one.
We will assume that borrowing and lending are entirely real. They take the form of
contracts for a fixed amount of a single good at the horizon. Exchange rate hedging
involves borrowing a foreign good. This is equivalent to taking a forward position in
that good.
Actual exchange rate hedging is generally nominal rather than real. This means it is
a "noisy" form of hedging. When investors can do only nominal hedging, they may
tend to do less of it. On the other hand, if price level changes have real effects,
investors may do more nominal hedging than real hedging.
We will assume that each investor consumes a single good, and that there are
hedging contracts for that good. Even if an investor consumes goods produced in
many parts of the world, the model will hold if he hedges in a contract that reflects
his exact consumption basket, so long as the proportions of different goods in the
basket are fixed.

In fact, though, even real contracts fail to reflect an investor's actual consumption
basket in most cases. This is another source of noise that may affect the amount he
hedges.

Actually, we will assume nothing about national boundaries per se. We assume that
there are hedging contracts for each investor's consumption good, whether or not
investors live in different countries.
We will assume that the investor's horizon is an infinitesimal time in the future.
The results when investors consume continuously into the future should be similar
so long as the inputs to the model fit the horizon. But the difference between
nominal hedging and real hedging may be greater with a longer horizon.
To make this model correct for the first instant of a full continuous time model, we
will want to assume that future tastes and technology are known at the start. If
there are uncertain state variables that affect future tastes or technology, investors
will hedge against unfavorable outcomes for those state variables.
We will assume a single real asset representing the world market portfolio. Write

"y,," for the payoff in good i of one unit of the market portfolio, and "fm$" for
the forward price of one unit of the market portfolio. The uncertain payoff y1 is

worth f, units of good i for sure.
6

Write "x,," for the exchange rate, at the horizon, from good i to good j .

We

assume that the exchange can go in either direction at this rate. An exchange from

i to j and back again returns the investor to his starting point.
As in the simple example, we are assuming a technology that allows conversion of
one good into another. Our results do not, however, depend on such a technology.
We can also assume uncertain endowments of the goods, where the exchange rates
are the equilibrium prices for exchanging the goods. With the right choices for the
endowments, this will lead to the same equilibrium.

Write "f," for the forward rate from good i to good j . In other words, f,,
is the forward price of good i in units of good j . Now we can write the
following relations among these variables:

!Imj = YmiXij

(4)

f,nj

= fmiftj

(5)

= zux

(6)

xii = 1/x,

(7)

Yrnj/f,nj = (ymi/fmi)(3ij/fij)

(8)

From (4) and (5), we have:

Write "dms" for the market return over the infinitesimal interval in units of good
i . Write "e22" for the return on good i in units of good j . In other words,
dmi is the fractional difference between the actual and forward values of the market
portfolio at the horizon, and e, is the fractional difference between the actual and
forward exchange rates. This means:

7

1+drni=ymi/f,ni

1+e=

(9)

(10)

From equations (6), (7), and (8), we have:

1 + dmj

= (1

+ dmi)(l + e,)

(11)

1 + Cik = (1 + e,,)(1 + eJk)

(12)

+ e31 = 1/(1 + ci,)

(13)

We will generally use the subscript "m" to refer to the market, and subscripts
"i", "j", and "k" to refer to goods. Write "hmi" for the mean of dms, and

"hi," for the mean of e,

Write "g,," for the variance of dmj , and "go" for the variance of e, . Write
"gmij" for the covariance of dmj and e, , and "gijk" for the covariance of e:j.
and e3k
Returns are stochastic, but variances and covariances are nonstochastic, as
explained in Merton (1982). Starting from equation (13), Jensen's inequality or
Siegel's paradox comes out like equations (14) and (15).

= —eij + g,

+e=

gij

(14)

(15)

Since the last term in equation (14) is nonstochastic, we can multiply both sides by

or e1 to give:
8

= g1, = g13 = 9jji

(16)

From the definition of g11j , we have:

9jik = gijk

(17)

From equation (12), we have:

= e, + e,k — gikj

(18)

Again in equation (18), we have an extra "Jensen's inequality" term. From
equations (14) and (18) and the definition of 9,jk , we have:

gijk + 9jk3

= gJk

(19)

From (11), we have:

dmj = dmi + Cij — g,,31

(20)

From (20) and (14) and the definition of gmij , we have:

9mij = flmji + 9ij
9mij + g,31 =
9

(21)

(22)

From (15), we have:

h,, + h,, = gj,

(23)

To set up the investor's optimization problem, write "Wm," for the fraction of
wealth that investors who consume good j hold in the market. Note that we use
"forward values" to figure this and related fractions. No present values are defined
in this model.

Write "w,," for gross borrowing of good j by investors who consume good i
For all goods but the home good, gross borrowing is the same as net borrowing, and
is equal to the amount of hedging in good j done by investors who consume good
i . Gross borrowing is expressed as a fraction of wealth.

Write "d,,," for the portfolio return for investors who consume j, with mean

"h" and variance "g". The investor wants to minimize g for given hr,.
d, = Wm,dmj — Ew,kekj

From (24), we can write the investor's problem as:

From (29), we have:

(49)

Thus A is a weighted average of investor risk tolerances, where the weight a2 is
the fraction of world wealth owned by investors with risk tolerance A, . Since the
are positive, equation (49) also tells us that A must be positive. Adler and
Dumas (1983, p. 952) give a result that leads directly to the fact that optimal
hedging depends on this average of investor risk tolerances.

equation (48) as:

"o" for hm, g, , and g . Then we can write

I'm —

(62)

It may be easier to remember the definitions of the inputs in this form.
Equations (2), (35), and (39) define A . As we have noted, A measures the degree
to which foreign investment remains unhedged. We measure foreign investment as in
(40) by the wealth of foreign investors, not by the locations of foreign assets. Thus
1 — A measures the degree to which investors hedge their foreign investments.
Since Siegel's paradox implies that exchange rate risk adds to investors' expected
returns,we expect that investors will generally be less than fully hedged.
It's even possible that investors will want so much exchange rate risk that we will
have A greater than 1.0. Then they will add to the exchange rate risk in their
foreign investments. The amount hedged will be negative.
From (25), (26), (29), (30), (31), and (32), we have:
= A, = Wm,A

(63)

that we defined portfolio return in (24), expressing the weights Wmi and
as fractions of investor wealth. Write "hb," and "go," as the mean and
variance of portfolio returns for investor j where the returns are defined in terms
of the investor's holdings of the world market portfolio. We have:
Recall

16

gb,/hb, = A

(64)

In other words, A is the ratio of variance to mean for the overall portfolio of risks
held by each investor, including both market risk and exchange rate risks. It is the
same for every investor even though investors use different goods in evaluating the
payoffs from their investments.
Thus A measures average risk tolerance across investors. The greater the risk
tolerance of the world's investors, the smaller the market's expected return will be
for given endowments, and the more exchange rate risk they will take. Breeden
(1979) also makes use of the aggregate risk tolerance in his intertemporal
consumption-based asset pricing model.
Note that the amount of exchange rate risk investors will take on does not approach
zero as exchange rate volatility approaches zero. Write Ao for the exposure to
exchange rate risk in the limiting case of zero exchange rate volatility. We have:

A0 = gm/hm

(65)

When exchange rate volatility is exactly zero, investors are indifferent to the
amount of hedging they do. The hedge will have no effect.

The market's risk premium is not observable, so it will be hard to estimate A even
when the world is in equilibrium. Right now, investors have far too little
international diversification, assuming investment barriers are not a problem. So it's
even harder to estimate what A will be when the world is in equilibrium.
Many people, including Friend and Blume (1975), have tried to estimate average
risk tolerance in ways other than this. If other methods give reliable estimates, we
can use them instead of formulas like (62). Mehra and Prescott (1985) discuss
several other estimates of average risk tolerance. For reasons discussed in Black
(1989), I think (62) is the most reliable method for estimating A

When making your estimates, recall that j.i,,, is like "expected excess return" over
and above interest. Also, or is an average of exchange rate volatility over all
possible pairs of countries, including a country paired with itself. For these
self-pairs, the volatility is zero. Finally, recall that both o, and o- are averages
of variances, not standard deviations. The average of variances will generally be
17

higher than the squared average of standard deviations. Frankel (1988) discusses
methods for estimating exchange rate volatilities. Edwards (1987, 1988) gives
estimates of exchange rate volatilities for developing countries.
In Tables 1-6, we give some historical data that may help you create inputs for the
formula. Table 1 just gives the weights that you can apply to different countries in
estimating the three averages. Most of the weight will be on Japan, the US, and the
UK. In Tables 2-4, we have historical statistics for 1986-88, and in Tables 5-7, we
have historical statistics for 1981-85.
When averaging exchange rate volatilities over pairs of countries, we include the
volatility of a country's exchange rate with itself. That volatility is always zero, so
the average exchange rate volatilities in Tables 4 and 7 are lower than the averages
of the positive numbers in Tables 2 and 5.

The excess returns in Tables 3 and 6 are averages across countries of the world
market return minus the interest rate in that country. They differ between countries
because of differences in exchange rate movements. The excess returns are not
national market returns. For example, in 1987 the Japanese market did better than
the US market, but the world market portfolio did better relative to interest rates in
the US than in Japan.

Exchange rate volatility contributes to average stock market volatility; as we shall
see, it even contributes to the average return on the world market. Thus, for
consistency, both m and a should be greater than
Looking at Tables 4 and 7, here is one way to create inputs for the formula. The

average excess return on the world market was 3% in the earlier period and 11% in
the later period. A possible estimate for the future is 8%. The world market
volatility was higher in the more recent period, but that included the crash, so we
may want to use the 15% from the earlier period. The average exchange rate
volatility of 10% in the earlier period may also be a better guess for the future than
the more recent 8%.
Thus some possible values for the inputs are:

1m 8%
Cm 15%
Ce

10%

With these inputs, the fraction hedged comes to 77%.
For comparison, let's see what happens when we use the historical averages from
either the earlier period or the later period in the formula.

With the historical averages from the earlier period as inputs, the fraction hedged
comes to 30%, while the historical averages from the later period give a fraction
hedged of 73%.

We generally won't use straight historical averages, because they can vary so much.
We want estimates of future volatilities for the formula. Taylor (1987) discusses
some general methods for forecasting exchange rate volatilities.
DISCUSSION

Note that in this model, everything but the average world market risk premium hm
is exogenous. So we can take an equation like (47) as fixing hm in terms of inputs
A, g,,,,, and g. Still, if we feel we can estimate hm ,we can use (47) in figuring
an estimate for A
Why don't the equations like (47) involve means or covariances of exchange rate
changes? Because the impact of the means exactly offsets the impact of the
covariances.

Roughly, investors in country A can hedge their foreign investments in B only if
investors in B hedge their foreign investments in A. Every trade has two sides.

Suppose that exchange rate risks are such that a hedge reduces portfolio risk for
investors in A, but not for investors in B. Then investors in A will be willing to pay
investors in B to take on a hedge. The mean exchange rate change will adjust until
both sides are happy putting on the hedge.
In equilibrium, the expected exchange rate changes and the correlations between
exchange rate changes and stock returns cancel one another.
In the same way, the Black-Scholes option pricing formula includes neither the
underlying stock's expected return nor its beta. In equilibrium, they cancel one
another.

The capital asset pricing model is similar. The optimal portfolio for any investor
could depend on expected returns and volatilities for all available assets. In
equilibrium, though, the optimal portfolio for any investor is a mix of the market
19

portfolio with borrowing or lending. The expected returns and volatilities cancel
one another (except for the market as a whole), so neither affects the investor's
optimal holdings.
In the end, investors in A will hedge because it reduces risk, even though it also
reduces expected return; while investors in B will hedge because it increases
expected return, even though it also increases risk.

I am surprised by the ease with which we can aggregate in this model. Even though
people differ in wealth, risk tolerance, and consumption good, we take simple
weighted averages of volatility, expected excess return, and risk tolerance across
investors.
