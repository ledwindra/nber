In our model, firms must incur resource costs to introduce new products and forward-looking potential producers conduct R&D and enter the product market whenever profit opportunities exist Trade has both intra- industry and inter-industry components, and the different incentives that face agents in different countries for investment and savings decisions give rise to Intertemporal trade. We derive results on the dynamics of trade patterns and trade volume, and on the temporal emergence of multinational corporations\n\n",
