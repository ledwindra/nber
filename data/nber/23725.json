    "abstract": "\n\nThe Taylor rule in combination with  the zero lower bound on nominal rates has been shown to create an unintended  liquidity-trap equilibrium. The relevance of  this equilibrium  has been challenged on the basis that it is   not   stable under least-square learning. In this paper, we show that the liquidity-trap equilibrium is stable under social learning. The learning mechanism we employ includes three realistic elements: mutation, crossover, and  tournaments. We show that agents can learn to have pessimistic sentiments about the central bank's ability to generate price growth,  giving rise to  a stochastically stable environment characterized by deflation and stagnation.\n\n",
