NBER Working Paper 455
~ebruary~ 1980
A Consistent Characterization
of A Near-Century of Price Behavior
ABSTRACT
This paper develops a single econometric equation that can explain most of
i

the variation in the aggregate U.S. rate of inflation during the period between
1892· and 1978.

Unlike previous studies that have omitted the Depression and World

War II years, the present equation can explain the 1929-1945 period as well as
other years.

The equation is derived from a simple aggregate supply equation and

makes the rate of price change depend on the rate of change of nominal GNP, the
level of de trended real GNP, and on expected price change; the latter, in turn,
depends on lagged values of price change and nominal GNP change.

Four additional

factors are identified that have had a significant impact on the price-setting
process: the National Recovery Act (1933-1936), World War II price controls (19431947), the Nixon-era controls

(1972~1975),

and the relative prices of food and

energy.
The most surprising result is that the contemporaneous elasticity of price
change to nominal GNP change has been roughly one-third for almost a century,
both in a single equation fitted to the whole period and in equations fitted to
three sub-periods.

The formation of price expectations changed completely after

1950 from regressive expectations appropriate under a gold standard to extrapolative
inertia-dominated expectations appropriate under a fiat money standard and postwar
long-period wage contracts.

The results also imply that restrictive aggregate

demand policy would have a much greater immediate impact in slowing inflation than
implied by other econometric work on postwar data.

A CONSISTENT CHARACTERIZATION
OF A NEAR-CENTURY OF PRICE BEHAVIOR
by Robert J. Gordon *
This paper demonstrates that the commonly used "Expectationa1 Phillips
Curve" (EPC) framework cannot explain the last 87 years of aggregate price
behavior in the United States.

The EPC explanation, which in its most general

form relates price change to expected inflation and the leveZ of detrended
output, obscures the fact that price change has been much more closely related
to the contemporaneous rate of change of detrended output.

Over the near-

century of annual data studied here, a change in output has shown a remarkably
consistent tendency to be associated in annual data with a simultaneous change
in the price level of about one-half as much.

Stated another way, nominal

GNP changes have been divided consistently, with two-thirds taking the form
of output change and the remaining one-third the form of price change.

This

finding applies not only over the entire 1890-1978 sample period, but also
over three sub-periods (1890-1929, 1929-1953, and 1953-1978).
The dominance of the output "rate-of:"change" (ROC) explanation of price
change over the "level" EPC explanation is not a new result but rather confirms previous findings by Allan Meltzer, myself, and others. 1

Nevertheless

much recent literature on both postwar and historical price behavior has
shown no awareness of the importance of the ROC phenomenon and has continued
to specify equations based on the unadorned

EPC. 2

A second theme of this paper is that almost a century of price behavior
can be explained with a single equation, in contrast to other historical
studies that find it necessary to exclude years of depression, war, or both.
While the single equation estimated here has a coefficient on the "ROC effect"

2

that is extremely stable over the entire sample period, it verifies a marked
shift after the Korean war in the formation of expectations regarding the
price level and its rate of change,

This shift reinforces the emphasis

placed by Meltzer and Benjamin Klein on the contrast between the regressive
expectations appropriate under a gold standard and the extrapolative expectations used to predict inflation under the postwar fiat money standard.

And

although this shift is consistent in overall timing with the research of
Phillip Cagan and Jeffrey Sachs, its representation differs here, because
while the formation of inflation expectations has shifted in the postwar years,
the cyclical impact of detrended output changes has not.

I.

SPECIFYING A REDUCED-FORM PRICE EQUATION

Because the length of this paper is so tightly restricted, we concentrate
on results for annual price data 3• Several recent papers take as their point
of departure a standard EPC framework that makes the inflation rate (Pt)
e
depend on the expected inflation rate (Pt) and the "gap" between actual and

"natural" output (or unemployment).

In the following discussion it is con-

venient to designate logs of levels of variables by upper-case letters; rates
of change by lower-case letters; and the "gap" variable as the log of the
ratio of actual real GNP to "natural" real GNP (Q

=

*

Q~).

Thus, the EPC

hypothesis becomes:
(1)

=

where n t is an error term.

We would expect a,2

=1

if the "natural rate

hypothesis" holds and if expected inflation is measured accurately, and

3

a

o=0

if the log of natural output (Q *) is measured accurately.

We shall find, however, that (1) is too restrictive a hypothesis to
allow adequate characterization of secular changes in U. S. price behavior.
Instead a more general approach can be developed if we start with a simple
aggregate supply function that allows the difference between the actual and
expected price.ZeveZ to respond positively to the output ratio (Q):
(2)

=

e > o.

The positive slope of the aggregate supply curve can be explained in the
traditional textbook fashion as resulting from the diminishing marginal
productivity and increasing supply schedules of factor inputs, including both
materials and labor.

It is also consistent with the strong effect of output-

ratio variables on the price of inelastically-supplied primary products and
on oligopo1istic price markups found in recent studies of postwar data. 4

A general specification of the formation of expectations allows agents
to distinguish between expected inflation (p~) and shifts in the expected
price level (p et )..
(3)

+ AP _ + (1-A)P _ •

TQe expected rate of inflation in turn can be specified to depend on past
values of actual and expected inflation and any other relevant information,
e.g., the past rates of change of nominal or real GNP, the money supply,
wages, or unemployment.

4

An appealing feature of (3) is its applicability to price series with
differing patterns of serial correlation.

For instance, under a gold standard

we might find the price level jumping up and down around a stable or slowly
moving trend, and in this case the parameter A might be small.

But under the

postwar fiat-money standard, few increases in the price level have been
reversed.

Thus rational agents might set A = 1 and then apply this period's

expected inflation rate (p~) to last period's actual price level.
"If, for example, an eight percent inflation rate occurred in a
particular year [under the gold standard], an inflation rate of
approximately minus eight percent would likely occur a short time
later • • • • The gold standard can be considered to have been a
period of mean reversion in the rate of price change while the
current period is one of persistence,or long-term mean revision
in the rate of price change" (Benjamin Klein, pp. 193-4, emphasis
in the original).
When (3) is substituted into (2), with a bit of manipulation we can
derive an equation that relates the rate of inflation to the expected rate
of inflation and to both the level and rate of change of the output

(4)

=

'"

S(qt + AQt_l) +

ratio:

p~ + lIt'

where we use the notational convenience that Pt

= Pt

- P - , and where the
t l

new error term lIt is serially independent if the original error term £t is
serially independent.

Note that (4) reduces to the traditional EPC

equation (1) only if A

=

1. 5

5

If the rate of change of nominal GNP relative to natural output growth
(Yt

=

* is exogenous, then the qt term in (4) will be negatively
Yt - qt)

correlated with the error term, given the identity:
(5)

This problem can be avoided if we substitute (5) into (4) and obtain the
following expression that relates the inflation rate to "adjusted" nominal
GNP growth, the level of the output ratio, and the rate of expected inflation:

II.

DATA AND SPECIFICATION

Published annual data series exist for the 1890-1978 period for nominal
and real GNP, the GNP deflator, consumer prices, average hourly earnings, the
money supply, and the unemployment rate. 6

The "natural unemployment rate" is

assumed to be constant before 1955 for an unemployment concept that excludes
self-employed farmers and proprietors, since the latter experience little
unemployment, and "natural real GNP" (Q *) is an estimate of the real GNP that
the economy can produce when operating at its natural rate of unemployment. 7
Four issues must be discussed before equation (6) can be estimated.

The

first and most important is the choice of a proxy for the expected rate of
e

inflation (Pt).

Edgar Feige and Douglas Pearce have emphasized that inflation

expectations should be based on all available information making a marginal
contribution to the prediction of inflation that is worth more than its marginal acquisition cost.

Because of the shift in monetary standards over our

6

sample period, it is important that we allow agents to shift the variables
used to form expectations, and the coefficients applied to those variables. 8
We shall find, for instance, that the lagged inflation rate was very important
in helping to predict the persistence of inflation observed in the post-1952
period but was of no use in predicting inflation during the gold-standard
era.

We also allow lagged values of the rate of change of nominal income

and the money supply to influence the formation of expectations.
"

of the lagged output ratio (Q

t-

The presence

1) in equation (6) introduces an identification

problem, since we do not 'know whether a positive coefficient indicates an
important

influen~e

of that ratio on expected inflation, a high value of X,

or some mixture of the two. 9

A final difficulty is that agents observe

economic data at shorter frequencies than a year, so that current variables
may contain information used to form expectations.

We assume here that ex-

pectations are based entirely on last year's data, but in future research
quarterly versions of these equations will be estimated to assess the importance of this problem.
The second specification issue involves the treatment of episodes of
government interference in the price-setting process.

We introduce dummy

variables for three such episodes, the NRA, and price controls in World War II
and the Nixon era.

Each dummy variable is constrained to sum to 1.0 over

the years in which the program had its effect and to -1.0 over subsequent
years when the program was dismantled.

Thus each dummy variable sums to zero

over its total period of impact, and its coefficient indicates the cumulative
total effect of the program in question. 10

We also allow for supply shocks

by treating the relative price of food and energy as exogenous during 1947-78. 11

7

The third specification issue involves the treatment of World War I, for
which no dummy variables are created because there were no price controls.
After Britain departed from the gold standard in 1914, agents rightly expected the structure of price setting to change from the pre-19l4 norm.
The significance of this temporary change in structure is tested by allowing
coefficients to shift during the 1915-22 interval. 12
creation in World War I

The burst of money

presented a much greater contrast to the preceding

gold-standard era than did money creation in World War II (when the outbreak
of war was preceded by four years of explosive growth in the monetary base
during 1938-41).

Another difference between the two wars was the widespread

expectation in 1919-20 that the U. K. and U. S. would attempt to return to
the prewar gold price, requiring the extinction of much of the fiat money
created during the war, whereas the Fed's interest-rate pegging policy prevented the development of any such expectation in 1946-47.

Thus it is perhaps

not surprising that, although structural coefficients were allowed to shift
during World War II, no significant shift could be found other than the
direct impact of the price controls.
The final specification issue involves the interaction of inflation
expectations and special factors.

Agents were smart enough to know that the

end of wars in 1918 and 1945 made lagged prices an invalid predictor of future
price behavior, and they presumably were also aware of the dismantling of NRA,
and the end of the Nixon-era price controls.

To reflect the assumption of

intelligent expectation formation, the lagged price-change term used as one
of the expectations proxies is constructed "net" of the estimated contribution of the dummy variables and the food-energy contribution (thus requiring

8

iterative estimation).

In addition agents are assumed to have ignored the

Great Depression and wars by setting the net lagged price-change term equal
to zero in

1915~22

and 1929-49.

While there is no important difference

between the fit of the gross and net lagged inflation variables before 1953,
the introduction of the net variable cuts in half the unexplained variance in
the 1953-78 sub-period.

III.

THE ESTIMATED EQUATION FOR 1892-1978 AND THREE SUB-PERIODS

Estimates of equation (6) are shown in Table 1.

The first two lines

exhibit the coefficients for the first two variables in (6).

In the next

two lines lagged net price change and nominal GNP change are proxies for
expected inflation.

Lagged changes in the money supply (M2) were also in-

troduced but appear mainly to be collinear with lagged nominal GNP. 1 3
The "special factor" variables are listed last.

The four columns of the

table display the results of estimation for the entire sample period and
three sub-periods.
The remarkable stability across sub-periods of the coefficients on Yt is
evident, as is the significantly greater response of prices to Yt during
World War I.

The effect of the Phillips-curve variable, the lagged output

ratio, is surprisingly sma11--rea1 GNP slack of 5 percent (an output ratio
of .95) slows inflation by only two-thirds of a percentage point per year
in the postwar sub-period.
The shift in the role of lagged price change from regressive to extrapolative expectations stands out, both in the shift from negative coefficients
to a positive coefficient in the last sub-period, and to the significance

of the "extra 1953-78 effect" in the full sample period.

This shift in

structure was introduced in two alternative ways to compare Cagan's hypothesis
that the recession flexibility of prices has gradually diminished during
postwar recessions between 1949 and 1970, and an alternative hypothesis that
the new mode of expectation formation suddenly began in 1953.

The Cagan

hypothesis is tested in both columns (1) and (4) by multiplying the applicable
lagged price-change variable by the time trend that moves smoothly from
zero to unity between 1953 and 1970 and remains at unity thereafter.

The

Cagan variable does significantly worse in the postwar sub-period and
cannot explain why inflation was so low during 1961-65 in the face of rapid
nominal GNP growth.
How well do the equations in Table 1 fit as compared to the simple EPC
alternative?

The following is a comparison using our data of standard

errors of the equations in Table 1 with an EPC specification of Sachs which
includes only the current output ratio and four lagged values of the dependent
variable: 14

Results similar to those in Table 1 have been obtained for the same
specification applied to wage-change data.

The similarity of the price and

wage results suggests that the increased inertia observed in the postwar

10
period characterizes wages and prices together rather than any shift in the
cyclical behavior of the real wage.

The annual change in the real wage
'"

responds negatively to the lagged output ratio, and positively to Yt-l (before
1953), to the NRA, and to both the World War II and Nixon-era dummy variables.

IV.

IMPLICATIONS

The results in Table 1 establish that the elasticity of price change
to nominal GNP change has been approximately one-third for almost a century,
and that the serial correlation in the price-change variable has shifted
from negative to positive at some point in the early 1950s.

The inertia in

the price-change process in the postwar period tends to dissuade policymakers
from halting inflation, because a sluggish response of price change to
restrictive demand policy creates high unemployment and political pressure to
abandon the tight policy.

But the extremely simple equation displayed in

column (4) of Table 1 for the postwar years suggests a much greater payoff
to restrictive demand policy than has recently been believed.

An artificial

(and implausible) experiment which drops adjusted nominal GNP growth from
6 to 0 percent causes inflation to slow down 1.8 percentage points in the
first year, another 1.8 points in the second year, and 1.7 points in the
third year, for a total response of 5.3 points after only three years. IS
The change in the structure of expectation formation in the postwar
period also reminds us that the conclusions of many econometric studies may
be sensitive to extensions of sample period. I6

And it seems quite consistent

with a change in attitude in the first postwar decade toward recognition of

11
a fundamental change in the stabilizing role of government policy (initiatiyes
based more on the automatic stabilizers and new institutions like F.D.I.C.
than on countercyclical policy).

The shift also emphasizes the crucial role

of three-year staggered wage contracts, a uniq4e American institution that
dates back to the first postwar decade and that introduces positive serial
correlation in the wage-change data which in turn leads rational economic
agents to expect positive serial correlation in the price-change data.
Some proponents of the classical equilibrium approach to macroeconomics,
particularly Robert Barro, protest that because these wage-setting institutions
impose a high cost on some workers who experience employment fluctuations,
they must not exist, a position which ignores the fact that rational firms
and unions have chosen this bargaining pattern to minimize the real private
costs of negotiations and strikes.

The alternative classical equilibrium ex-

planation of business cycles, that output responds positively to price "surprises," seems an implausible description of the last two decades in terms
of the price equation developed in this paper, since the prolonged output
boom of 1965-69 followed five straight years (1963-67) when price change was
lower than the postwar equation can explain, while the "great recession" of
1974-75 occurred after six straight years (1970-75) when price change was

higher than the fitted va1ue. 17

FOOTNOTES

*Professor

of Economics, Northwestern University,. and Research Associate,

National Bureau of Economic Research.

The author is grateful. to Allan Meltzer

and Jeffrey Sachs for helpful discussions, and to Jon Frye and Ross Newman for
their skilled assistance.
1.

Meltzer provides a convincing demonstration of the importance of ROC

phenomena, and the unimportance of Phillips Curve variables, for a sample
period that includes 61 of the 87 years studied here.' R. A. Gordon shows the
importance of the change of the unemployment rate in wage equations and reviews
the 1958-72 literature, including several earlier articles that included the
change in unemployment.

My own previous research on postwar structural price

equations has always found strong effects of the rate of change of detrended
output or a similar demand variable.

For examples of such equations, and for

evidence that the ROC explanation is also important for postwar wage behavior,
see the author (1977, esp. pp. 269-70).

I discovered the importance of the

ROC explanation of interwar price behavior in writing a textbook case
study (1978, pp. 162-5) and with James Wilcox provided subsequent econometric
support.

Although they do not comment on the fact, the unemployment equation

estimated for 1930-65 by Robert Lucas and Leonard Rapping has such a large
coefficient on lagged unemployment that it amounts to a relation linking the
rates of change of unemployment, prices, and wages.
2.

The recent study of historical price behavior by Jeffrey Sachs

neither cites any of the papers listed in the previous footnote nor makes any
mention of ROC variables.

Edward Gramlich utilizes a so-called "mainline"

model for the explanation of postwar inflation in which neither the wage nor

15
price equations contain any ROC variables.
models
3.

Many other similar econometric

of the postwar inflation process could be cited.
Results for annual wage data are briefly discussed below.

Quarterly

data extending back to 1900 have also been prepared for most of the variables
and will be studied in a future paper.
4.

In addition to my evidence (1977) supporting a relation between the

price mark-up and de trended output, Richard Cooper and Robert Lawrence find
a significant relation between the prices of nonferrous metals, primary fibers,
and raw agricultural products, on the one hand, and detrended world industrial
output, on the other.
5.

Sachs rules out any relation between the inflation rate and the

change in the output ratio by assumption.

If the price-markup in his

equation (8) is allowed to be a function of the level of the output ratio,
then his model becomes underidentified.
6.

The starting date of 1890 is chosen because it marks the beginning

of the annual Kendrick GNP series, Rees cost-of-1iving and average hourly
earnings series, and the Lebergott unemployment series.

A data appendix is

available for interested readers [included for Atlanta discussants].

Equations

have been run with consumer prices as an alternative dependent variable and
with the unemployment gap replacing the output ratio, and there was no
important difference from the results presented in Table 1.
7.

The methodology is described in Gordon, 1978, Appendix C.

R. A. Gordon,

p. 275, stresses the importance of an adjustment for the declining secular
importance of the self-employed.
8.

Thus this paper recognizes Thomas Sargent's criticism that earlier

16
Phillips Curve work did not take account of the actual process by which
inflation is generated.
9.

If a short-frequency business cycle were expected, the effect of

Qt-l on expectations might be negative, raising the possibility that our
estimates of the coefficient on Qt-l might be biased toward zero.

This is

unlikely to occur in the postwar years, given the well-known positive serial
correlation of Qt.

The precise values of the dummy variables are chosen to provide a

measure of the timing impact of each program in annual data:

The "food-energy" variable in Table 1 is the difference for 1.947-

78 between the annual rates of change of the personal consumption deflator
and the deflator net of expenditures on food and energy.

12.

The importance for expectation formation of special events, like

wars and postwar adjustment periods, is stressed in Gordon (1973).

13.

Versions with lagged money perform better in the first subperiod

but substantially worse in 1929-53, reflecting the looseness of the moneyGNP relationship during the Great Depression emphasized by Gordon and Wilcox.

14.

To emphasize the contribution of the y variables in Table 1, the

four "special factor" variables are introduced into the Sachs specification
in addition to his dummy variable for World War I.

Sachs in Table 4 fits a

17
second EPC model, with only a constant term and the current and lagged output
ratio as right-hand variables, having respective sub-period standard errors
with our data of 5.25, 3.22, and 1.88.
15.

Of course the output ratio falls rapidly as well from 1.00 to .929

at the end of the third year.

Then a subsequent policy in the fourth through

sixth years of 3.0 percent adjusted nominal GNP will leave the' economy with
an inflation rate of only 1.3 percent and an output ratio of .993.
16.

The finding of Feige and Pearce that money contributes nothing

to the explanation of prices, when the influence of lagged prices is held
constant, is likely to be highly dependent on their 1953-71 sample period.
17.

The cumulative price error of -2.01 percentage points in 1963-67
~

can be contrasted with a swing in the output ratio (Q) of +8.8 percentage
points in 1961-66; the cumulative price error of +2.6 percentage points in
1970-75 can be contrasted with a swing in the output ratio of -7.8 percentage
points in 1973-75.

Real GNP, Natural.
1890-1955: A trend is extended between selected benchmark years when the
actual unemployment rate was close to the "natural" unemployment
rate, 1890, 1901, 1912, 1923, 1929, and 1950. In each benchmark
year the level of natural real GNP differs from actual real GNP by a
multiple of the difference between actual and natural unemployment,
with the exact method described in Gordon (1978, Appendix C, p. xxiii).
The choice of some benchmark years has been changed since the publication of that reference.

Unemployment Rate, Natural.
1890-1955: It was assumed that the natural rate of unemployment for "UA",
the unemployment rate calculated with the self-employed excluded
from the labor force, was equal to 5.0 percent, the value of UA
observed in late 1950. The natural rate for the official concept of
unemployment steadily drifts up during 1890-1955, reflecting the
falling share of the self-employed in the labor force.
1955-1978: The series developed in Perloff and Wachter (1978) was
supplied by Michael Wachter. Its 1977 value was extrapolated to 1978.
