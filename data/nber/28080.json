    "abstract": "\n\nWe collect detailed data on the technologies used in a comprehensive set of business functions in a representative sample of \ufb01rms in Vietnam, Senegal, and the Brazilian state of Cear\u00e1, and construct measures of technology sophistication at the business function and \ufb01rm levels. There is a large variance of sophistication across \ufb01rms, but we \ufb01nd that the variance of technology sophistication across the business functions of a \ufb01rm (within-\ufb01rm variance) is 2.8 times larger. We develop a model of technology adoption with heterogeneity in adoption costs across business functions and with non-homothetic production that induces heterogeneity in the marginal value of technology sophistication across functions. The model predicts a stable cross-\ufb01rm relationship between sophistication in the business function and \ufb01rm-level technology that we call the technology curve. We \ufb01nd that the slopes of technology curves di\ufb00er greatly across business functions and that curves account for one third of within-\ufb01rm variance in sophistication. A development accounting exercise shows that cross-\ufb01rm variation in sophistication measures accounts for thirty percent of cross-\ufb01rm di\ufb00erences in productivity.\n\n",
