    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper reports the results of an experiment evaluating the effects of incentives on individuals' willingness to participate in a survey.  By pairing the assessment with a natural field experiment, the analysis considers private versus public goods as incentives, and estimates respondents' willingness to support the oldest food bank in the U.S.\n\n",
