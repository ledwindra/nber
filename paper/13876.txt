International Evidence on Sticky Consumption Growth
Christopher D. Carroll, Jiri Slacalek, and Martin Sommer
NBER Working Paper No. 13876
March 2008
JEL No. E21,F41
ABSTRACT
We estimate the degree of 'stickiness' in aggregate consumption growth (sometimes interpreted as
reflecting consumption habits) for thirteen advanced economies. We find that, after controlling for
measurement error, consumption growth has a high degree of autocorrelation, with a stickiness parameter
of about 0.7 on average across countries. The sticky-consumption-growth model outperforms the random
walk model of Hall (1978), and typically fits the data better than the popular Campbell and Mankiw
(1989) model. In several countries, the sticky-consumption-growth and Campbell-Mankiw models
work about equally well.

Introduction

A large literature ranging across macroeconomics, finance, and international
economics has argued that ‘habit formation’ can explain many empirical facts
related to consumption dynamics, including stickiness in aggregate consumption growth.1 Other explanations for the persistence of aggregate spending
growth, or ‘excess smoothness’ (in Campbell and Deaton (1989)’s terminology), include imperfect attentiveness to macroeconomic news on the part of
consumers (Carroll and Slacalek (2006); Reis (2006)), or consumers’ inability
to distinguish micro- from macro-economic shocks (Pischke (1995)). Further
explanations could undoubtedly be imagined.
But a full consensus has not yet emerged on whether empirical data are
irreconcilable with Hall (1978)’s benchmark random walk model of consumption. Hall’s model implies that consumption growth is unpredictable (excess
smoothness is zero). However, standard extensions of the Hall model can generate some degree of stickiness in consumption growth. For example, excess
smoothness might merely reflect the fact that spending decisions are made
more frequently than consumption data are measured (Working (1960); this
viewpoint has recently been advocated in well known papers by Lettau and
Ludvigson (2001, 2004)). Also, in the presence of uncertainty, the precautionary saving motive slows down consumers’ response to shocks, which could
also explain part (though not all) of the excess smoothness (Ludvigson and
Michaelides (2001)). Another possibility, not often mentioned but nevertheless worth serious consideration, is that the smoothness of measured spending
reflects data construction methods (e.g. for components of spending for which
quarterly observations are imputed using annual data sources) rather than actual spending smoothness. Finally, many of the papers in the habit formation
literature have not carefully examined the possibility that their results might
reflect the presence of some ‘rule-of-thumb’ consumers, who simply set consumption equal to income in each period, as proposed in influential papers by
Campbell and Mankiw (1989, 1991).
Motivated by this debate and by the fact that much of the empirical evidence on excess smoothness has come from a single country (the U.S.), this
paper provides systematic estimates of three simple canonical models of con1

Facts that have been interpreted using habit formation models include the equity premium puzzle (Constantinides (1990) and Campbell and Cochrane (1999)), Granger causality
from growth rates to saving rates (Carroll, Overland, and Weil (2000)), the hump-shaped
response of consumption to income shocks (Fuhrer (2000)), the dynamic effects of fiscal policy (Ljungqvist and Uhlig (2000)), persistence in current account balances (Gruber (2004)),
and the home bias puzzle (Shore and White (2006)).

sumption dynamics using data for all advanced economies for which we were
able to construct appropriate datasets (thirteen countries in all). We compare
the random walk model of Hall (1978) with two alternatives: the Campbell
and Mankiw (1989) model, and a model that permits (but does not require)
excess smoothness. (We do not take a stand here on whether such smoothness
reflects habits, inattention, or other factors.)
Using both instrumental variables (IV) (section 3.1) and Kalman filter
structural (section 3.2) estimation methods, we find strong evidence of excess smoothness (‘stickiness’) in consumption growth in every country in our
sample.2 Although there is some variation across countries in the degree of
stickiness, in every country we can reject the hypothesis that the stickiness
coefficient is zero (the random walk theory), while in no country can we reject
the hypothesis that it is 0.7. Furthermore, wherever there is a clear distinction
between the two non-random-walk models, the consumption stickiness model
outperforms the rule-of-thumb model, usually by a decisive statistical margin. (In a few cases, the two non-random-walk models are not statistically
distinguishable from each other.)3
The large size of our estimated stickiness parameter may come as a surprise
to some readers, because the serial correlation coefficient for spending growth
in the raw data is much lower than 0.7 (for instance, it is about 0.35 in U.S.
data). The discrepancy reflects our use of econometric methods that are robust to the presence of measurement error. Consistent with Sommer (2007)’s
findings for the United States, our estimates suggest that in most countries at
least half of the quarterly variation in consumption growth reflects temporary
variation that can be interpreted either as measurement error or as truly transitory spending disturbances unrelated to the theoretical consumption model
(caused, for example, by unseasonal weather, which can have a nontrivial effect
2

Section 3.2.1 shows how our Kalman filter technique can be interpreted as a particularly
simple example of structural estimation of a DSGE model. Embedding our framework in a
larger macroeconomic structure would be relatively straightforward.
3
To our knowledge, the only comparable paper is Braun, Constantinides, and Ferson
(1993) (henceforth BCF), who estimate a habit formation model using data on total personal
consumption expenditures for six countries. BCF find evidence for stickiness in aggregate
consumption growth data in most countries. Their estimates of the habit persistence coefficient range between 0.57 and 0.93, but are often insignificant. Their paper also does not
test the assumption of habit formation against alternative models of consumption dynamics,
such as the Campbell–Mankiw model. Ferson and Constantinides (1991) report in a framework closely related to BCF that the evidence for habit formation seems stronger in the
U.S. data than in their international dataset. However, both papers use GMM to estimate
a nonlinear Euler equation, a method which is not robust to the presence of substantial
measurement error in consumption data.

at the quarterly frequency, cf. Sommer (2007)).4
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines two
theoretical frameworks that generate sticky consumption growth and provide
the conceptual framework for our estimation strategy. Section 3 presents the
main empirical results and Section 4 concludes.

Two Theories of Stickiness

This section sketches the two most popular theoretical frameworks—habit formation and sticky expectations—that can generate serial correlation in aggregate consumption growth. In the habit formation model, the serial correlation
coefficient χ reflects the strength of habits (if χ = 0, the model collapses
to the Hall random walk model); in the sticky information model, χ is the
fraction of aggregate expenditure by households that have not fully updated
their information set about the latest macroeconomic developments (again,
χ = 0 corresponds to the Hall model). Because the implications of the two
frameworks are indistinguishable in aggregate data, our empirical evidence is
consistent with either model.5

2.1

Habit Formation

Muellbauer (1988) proposed a simple model of habit persistence, in which the
representative consumer maximizes time-nonseparable utility

subject to the usual transversality condition and the dynamic budget constraint:
Bt+1 = (Bt − Ct )R + Yt+1 ,
(2)
where β is the discount factor, C is the consumption level, B is beginningof-period net assets, R is the constant interest factor, and Y is noncapital
income. Ct−1 in (1) represents the ‘habit stock,’ i.e., the reference level of
consumption to which the consumer compares the current consumption level.
The parameter χ captures the strength of habits. After rewriting the utility


function as u(Ct − χCt−1 ) = u (1 − χ)Ct + χ∆Ct , one can see that, for
χ ∈ (0, 1), the consumer derives utility from both the level and the change in
consumption.
Muellbauer (1988) and Dynan (2000) have shown that for a habit-forming
consumer with a Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) outer utility u(X) =
X 1−ρ /(1 − ρ) and Rβ = 1, optimal consumption growth approximately follows
an AR(1) process:
∆ log Ct = χ∆ log Ct−1 + t ,
(3)
where t denotes innovations to lifetime resources. Hence, in contrast to the
standard intertemporally separable utility specification, some of the period t
consumption growth is predetermined at time t − 1. The strength of habits χ
can be estimated as the autocorrelation coefficient in the equation for aggregate
consumption growth.

2.2

Sticky Expectations

Carroll and Slacalek (2006) present an alternative model of consumer behavior
that also generates sticky aggregate consumption growth, but without departing from the standard intertemporally separable utility specification. The key
assumption is that consumers are mildly inattentive to macro developments—
for example, they do not immediately and fully take into account information
contained in aggregate macroeconomic indicators such as productivity growth
or the unemployment rate.6
Assume for a moment that consumers P
maximize the discounted sum of
t−s
(Ct − C̄)2 subject to the
time separable quadratic utility streams − ∞

budget constraint (2). In the standard Hall (1978) model, in which households
use all available information, the optimal consumption level follows a random
walk and consumption growth is a white noise: ∆Ct = t .
Suppose now instead that the economy consists of a continuum of inattentive consumers, each of whom updates the information about his permanent
income with probability Π in each period. For each consumer, this probability
is assumed to be independent of the date when the consumer last updated his
information set and independent of his income or wealth. The model therefore is similar to the Calvo (1983) model of price setting frequently used in
the monetary economics literature. Carroll and Slacalek (2006) show that the
change in aggregate consumption, ∆Ct , approximately follows an AR(1) process, whose autocorrelation roughly equals the share of consumers (1 − Π) who

utility is of the CRRA form, consumption growth is well approximated by:7

In addition, in the spirit of Akerlof and Yellen (1985) and Cochrane (1991),
Carroll and Slacalek (2006) show that the utility loss from the infrequent
updating of expectations is very small.
As noted above, since the two theories of stickiness generate identical implications for aggregate consumption growth dynamics, evidence of a positive
serial correlation coefficient will be consistent with either theory. (The theories
can be distinguished in other ways, e.g. using microeconomic data; see Carroll
and Slacalek for details and evidence.)

Empirical Results

This section tests the model of sticky consumption growth (3) and (4) against
the alternatives of rule-of-thumb behavior and the random walk hypothesis.
The organizing framework for our empirical analysis is a specification for consumption growth adopted in the excess sensitivity literature,8 which has been
expanded here to include a term capturing stickiness of consumption growth:
∆ log Ct = ς + χ Et−2 [∆ log Ct−1 ] + η Et−2 [∆ log Yt ] + α Et−2 [At−1 ] + t , (5)
where Y denotes household income and A denotes household (net) assets. The
first two right-hand side regressors correspond to two of the tested theories of
consumption behavior: inattentiveness or habit formation (∆ log Ct−1 ) and
rule-of-thumb consumers (∆ log Yt ). Under the third tested theory—the random walk hypothesis—the coefficients χ and η should both be zero. The third
term in the equation above (At−1 ) is included as a control—any of the three
theories allow for some direct effect of asset holdings on consumption growth,
either due to effects related to uncertainty (which induces a precautionary
saving motive) or due to time variation in interest rates (which we assume is
captured by time variation in the capital-to-income ratio A).9
7

Similar dynamics of aggregate consumption growth are also implied by the ‘rational
inattention’ models of Reis (2006) and potentially also Sims (2003).
8
Early contributions include Flavin (1981), Campbell and Deaton (1989), and Campbell
and Mankiw (1989).
9
By including the assets in the estimated equation, we follow the literature on precautionary savings and liquidity constraints. Calibrated theoretical models imply that the

5

There are at least three reasons to expect the OLS estimates of coefficients in (5) to be biased and inconsistent. First, as argued by Wilcox (1992)
and Sommer (2007), quarterly consumption data may be contaminated with
substantial measurement error. Second is the undoubted existence of transitory spending disturbances such as those related to unseasonal weather (or
even, for some smaller countries, one-time events such as the hosting of the
Olympics). None of the theoretical models include these kinds of shocks, yet
back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest their effects could be substantial in
quarterly data. Our final reason for expecting OLS to be biased is the wellknown problem of time aggregation.10
We develop these points using the United States as an example. The clearest source of measurement error in quarterly aggregate consumption data is
the services sector, because many components of the quarterly services data
are calculated by interpolating from the underlying annual or biennial data
sources (Bureau of Economic Analysis (2006)). However, sampling and nonsampling errors introduce significant measurement error even into other categories of consumption data (see Sommer (2007) for details). Sommer also
argues that weather-related events can significantly influence aggregate consumption expenditures. For example, under some plausible assumptions, Hurricane Katrina may have reduced quarterly personal consumption expenditure
(PCE) growth by about 1 percentage point on an annualized basis in Q3:2005.
However, even a much more benign event such as mild winter can reduce annualized quarterly consumption growth significantly—for instance, by about
1/4 percentage point in the United States in Q1:2006—through lower outlays
on energy. All in all, Sommer estimates that measurement error and transitory consumption together account for about 50 percent of the quarterly U.S.
nondurables and services consumption volatility, consistent with his empirical
finding that the IV estimates of consumption persistence are about twice as
high as the OLS estimates.
To address these three estimation issues (measurement error, transitory
consumption, and time aggregation) in quarterly consumption data, we use
relationship between At and Et [Rt+1 ] is almost linear. However, empirical estimates of
Euler equations using macro data generally produce insignificant (or even implausible) coefficients on expected interest rates (see, e.g., Hall (1988) and table 3 of Campbell and
Mankiw (1991); and Vissing-Jørgensen (2002) for evidence in micro consumption data).
10
Working (1960)’s analysis shows that if consumers with time separable preferences make
purchase decisions more often than consumption data are observed, time aggregation generates an MA(1) process in observed consumption growth even when preferences are otherwise
standard as in Hall (1978). In a simple habit formation or sticky information model of the
type presented in this paper, time aggregation generates an MA(2) process in consumption
growth (Muellbauer (1988), Sommer (2007)), but the MA(2) coefficient is generally small.

two econometric methods developed in Sommer (2007). The first technique
attempts to correct for the estimation issues using instrumental variables regressions. As with any IV method, validity of the estimation results depends
on the ability to find suitable instruments. As an alternative, the second technique therefore uses the Kalman filter to separate ‘true’ consumption growth
from its transitory components and measurement error.11 In this case, the
usual caveat applies: The validity of this maximum likelihood method hinges
on the assumed structure of the stochastic processes for measurement error
and ‘true’ consumption dynamics.

3.1
3.1.1

Sticky Consumption Growth in IV Regressions
Dataset

Equation (5) is estimated using aggregate quarterly data from thirteen advanced economies ranging roughly over the past forty years (table 6 provides
data details). Our preferred measure of consumption is the sum of expenditures on nondurable goods and services. However, this measure is available
only for six countries in our sample (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the U.K.
and the U.S.); total personal consumption expenditures are therefore used for
the other sample countries.12 Finally, Y and A are measured as household
disposable income and the ratio of financial wealth to disposable income, respectively.
11

Aficionados of Bayesian estimation of DSGE models may wish to reinterpret our estimates as a maximum likelihood estimator of a particularly simple structural model with
measurement error and a weak prior. See Section 3.2 for details.
12
For the six countries for which nondurables and services data are readily available, regression results using total PCE are similar to those reported in the paper for nondurables
and services. Since durable consumption growth is generally mildly negatively autocorrelated (Mankiw (1982)), the estimates of consumption persistence χ for the other countries
for which we use data on the total PCE (see the bottom panel of table 1) may be biased downward, making our evidence in favor of strong consumption stickiness likely to
be conservative. Japan is not included in our sample as creating a quarterly dataset with
consumption data prior to 1980 would involve splicing consumption series based on three
very different methodologies. Adjustments to the Japanese national accounts methodology
in 2002 and 2004 have significantly improved the reliability of quarterly consumption series
but the current-methodology data are only available since Q1:1994 (International Monetary
Fund (2006)). For the U.S., it is possible to perform similar experiments using data on
purely nondurable goods spending and on retail sales spending, with results similar to those
reported here for PCE excluding durables.

3.1.2

Instruments

The main advantage of IV estimation is that with appropriate instruments,
there is no need to make assumptions about the stochastic structure of measurement error and other transitory fluctuations in quarterly consumption
growth. The only requirements are that the instruments are uncorrelated
with measurement error and temporary consumption fluctuations, but correlated with the instrumented variables.
Under habit formation or sticky expectations, Sommer (2007) shows that
time aggregation makes “true” consumption growth ∆ log Ct∗ (i.e., consumption growth without measurement error and transitory consumption) follow
an ARMA(1,2) process:
∗
∆ log Ct∗ = c0 + χ∆ log Ct−1
+ vt + λ1 (χ)vt−1 + λ2 (χ)vt−2 ,

(6)

where the λs are complicated functions of χ. In addition, Sommer verifies that
the MA(2) coefficient λ2 is close to zero for all reasonable values of χ ∈ (0, 1),
so that ∆ log Ct∗ is approximately ARMA(1,1). Given these considerations,
equation (5) can be estimated using the IV estimator with instruments lagged
at least twice (e.g., dated as of time t − 2 and earlier).13
The baseline instrument set for the IV regressions consists of variables that
are strongly correlated with consumption growth and yet unlikely to be correlated with measurement error: the unemployment rate, a long-term interest
rate, and an index of price volatility.14 Consumer sentiment is also used as an
instrument whenever available (the G-7 countries and Australia), as in Carroll,
Fuhrer, and Wilcox (1994) and others.
13

Ideally, it would be desirable to use instruments dated t − 3 or earlier, but for some
countries the t − 3 instruments did not have sufficient predictive power for the instrumented
variables.
14
Consumer price volatility is robustly negatively correlated with real consumption growth
in all sample countries—this relationship is known among business cycle forecasters as the
‘Katona Effect’; see, e.g., Okun (1981), p. 216. In economic terms, periods of above-average
price volatility tend to be associated with shocks that may also have an impact on permanent
income. This instrument is attractive because it can be readily calculated for any country
and it is unlikely to be correlated with measurement error in consumption growth. The
variable appears to be widely used in the professional forecasting community but is not as
common in academic work. Price volatility at time t, VtP, is calculated as the coefficient
P
P
of variation over the past four quarters: VtP = σt−4,t
/µP
t−4,t , where σt−4,t is the standard
deviation of price level between quarters t − 4 and t and µP
t−4,t denotes the mean of price
level between quarters t − 4 and t.

3.1.3

Estimation Results

Table 1 summarizes the baseline estimation results for four alternative econometric specifications nested in equation (5).15 The left panel reports the results
from univariate regressions in which each right-hand side variable enters the
estimated specification as the only regressor. The first column extends Sommer’s (2007) findings for the United States to the international data: the IV
estimates of consumption persistence χ are for all countries much higher than
would be the OLS estimates and are highly statistically significant. The IV
estimates of consumption persistence in table 1 are on average about 0.7—a
strong rejection of the random walk proposition which implies a coefficient of
zero.
The second column estimates the Campbell–Mankiw model. Our results
are broadly consistent with the evidence presented in Campbell and Mankiw
(1991): Rule-of-thumb consumers (for whom, by assumption, consumption
equals current income) are on average estimated to earn about η ≈ 0.4 of
aggregate income. Interestingly, the estimates of η in the left panel are often
less significant than those of consumption persistence χ and are in four cases
insignificant. This means that—aside from the question of how the Campbell–
Mankiw model stands up against the alternative of habit formation or sticky
expectations—rule-of-thumb spending behavior cannot be reliably detected in
about a third of our sample countries.
The third column investigates the relative importance of wealth (expressed
as the ratio of net financial assets to income) in aggregate consumption dynamics. The coefficient on the wealth–to–income ratio, α, turns out to be
statistically significant only in four countries, where, in addition, the coefficient α has the opposite sign to that predicted by either precautionary saving
theory or intertemporal substitution as channelled through the interest rate.
This is unsurprising for at least two reasons. First, the overwhelming significance of consumption (and also income) in the previous regressions implies
a severe omitted-variable bias problem with the univariate regression that
only includes wealth. Second, the previous literature generally finds little evidence of interest rate or precautionary saving effects in aggregate consumption
data.16
15

An advantage of our reduced-form estimates of the consumption function over the estimated dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models (DSGE, which started with the
influential work of Smets and Wouters (2003); see An and Schorfheide (2007) for a review)
is that we do not use informative priors. Our parameters could thus be used as an input for
prior distributions (as in Del Negro and Schorfheide (2004)).
16
Microeconomic evidence suggests that the precautionary saving motive may be an important determinant of household-level consumption decisions, see for example Carroll and

9

The fourth column displays the adjusted R2 s from the first-stage regressions
of consumption growth on instruments (denoted R̄c2 ). This measure of the
strength of instruments ranges between 0.1 and 0.2 for most countries.17,18
The right panel of table 1 reports estimation results when all three regressors are included in equation (5). The results strongly suggest that past
consumption growth is by far the strongest predictor of current consumption
growth. The average persistence parameter in the country regressions falls
only very slightly compared with the average estimates from univariate regressions reported in the left panel (from χ ≈ 0.7 to χ ≈ 0.6) and remains
statistically significant at the five percent level in ten of our thirteen countries.
The predicted income growth term dominates the lagged consumption term
only in one country, Germany.19 The last column of the right panel reports the
p-values of the Hansen’s overidentification test—results of which imply that
the null of instrument exogeneity cannot be rejected.
Table 2 averages the coefficient estimates from table 1 across various country groups. As in table 1, while the average consumption persistence χ falls
relatively little after income and wealth are added to the estimated equations
(compare the right and left panels of the table), the income and wealth coefficients become essentially zero. The result holds for all five groups of countries
reported in the table which suggests considerable homogeneity in χ among
advanced economies, a fact already apparent in the previous table with the
results for individual countries.
Table 3, whose format is identical to table 1, estimates aggregate consumption dynamics with an alternative instrument set, in which long-run interest
rates and price volatility have been replaced with income growth and the
interest-rate spread. The estimation results are broadly consistent with our
baseline: (i) the coefficient on lagged consumption growth in univariate reSamwick (1997), Gourinchas and Parker (2002), and Fuchs-Schündeln and Schündeln (2005).
17
Ideally, one would prefer first stage R̄c2 coefficients larger than those generated by our
instrument set for some countries. For each individual country it is possible to find a countryspecific instrument set that performs considerably better than our universal instrument set.
We preferred to run the well-understood risks of weak instruments (coefficients biased toward
the OLS value) rather than the much more difficult to quantify risks associated with cherry
picking a different instrument set for each country.
18
The adjusted R2 s from the first-stage regressions on income growth are comparable with
the R2 s from the first-stage regressions on consumption growth. The R2 s are much higher
for the wealth–to–income ratio, about 0.8.
19
Germany tends to be an outlier in all our IV regressions (reported and unreported). This
may reflect data difficulties associated with comparing pre- and post-reunification German
data, or the unpredictable movements in consumption growth during the years following
reunification.

10

gressions is large and significant for ten countries, (ii) in the regressions that
include all three regressors, the coefficients on instrumented income growth
and wealth tend to be small and less often statistically significant compared
with univariate regressions (iii) lagged consumption growth beats lagged income in nine horse-race regressions (but gets badly beaten in German data).

3.2

Kalman Filter/Maximum Likelihood Evidence on
Sticky Consumption Growth

As a more efficient alternative to IV, we also estimate the dynamics of consumption growth using the Kalman filter. To proceed, it is necessary to specify
an assumption about the stochastic process of measurement error. We follow
the methodology of Sommer (2007) and assume that measurement error in the
log-level of consumption follows an MA(1) process.20 Observed consumption
growth, ∆ log Ct , can be written as the sum of ‘true’ consumption growth,
∆ log Ct∗ , and a measurement error, ut , as follows:
∆ log Ct = ∆ log Ct∗ + ut + (θ − 1)ut−1 − θut−2 ,
∗
∆ log Ct∗ = c0 + χ∆ log Ct−1
+ vt + λ1 (χ)vt−1 + λ2 (χ)vt−2 .

(7)
(8)

As noted above, λs are not free parameters but are complicated functions
of χ. The Kalman filter jointly estimates the sticky expectations coefficient χ
and the degree of the first autocorrelation in measurement errors, θ. The filter
also generates separate estimates of ‘true’ consumption growth, ∆ log Ct∗ , and
the measurement error component, ut . For the purposes of this subsection, we
assume that the correlation structure of measurement error remains unchanged
over the sample period.
The model described in equations (7) and (8) has been rewritten in a statespace form (see appendix B) and estimated using consumption data for the
countries in our dataset (listed in table 6). Table 4 presents the estimation
results. As in the case of the IV estimation, the coefficient reflecting consumption growth stickiness, χ, is large and highly statistically significant in almost
all sample countries. The value of χ typically ranges between 0.6 and 0.8, with
only Denmark and the United Kingdom coefficients estimated below 0.4. For
the United States, the estimated consumption persistence is about 0.7, which
is consistent with previous studies.
20

Taking a classical approach with white noise measurement error in the level of consumption is a priori not justifiable because all three main measurement error types are likely to
be serially correlated. The measurement error is therefore allowed to be serially correlated
in our model but the impact of error on the serial correlation properties of the consumption
data is limited. See Sommer (2007) for a more detailed discussion.

11

It is encouraging that the Kalman filter estimates of consumption persistence tend to be close to the IV estimates. This indicates that even if
instruments such as the lags of consumer sentiment and interest rates happened to be contaminated with some measurement error from the published
consumption data, the practical impact on the IV estimates reported in the
previous subsection is likely not large. The estimation results also suggest
that measurement error in the level of consumption is positively and significantly autocorrelated in about half of our sample countries—a fact that is not
surprising given the interpolation techniques that are often used by statistical
agencies when constructing quarterly consumption data.
The Kalman filter’s estimate of “true” consumption growth, ∆ log Ct∗ , is
presented, along with the raw data, in figures 1 and 2. The Kalman filter estimation suggests that the share of transitory components in published quarterly consumption data is large (about 50 percent for the United States and
even more for some countries), as a result of the combination of measurement error and transitory components.21 The interesting question is whether
the Campbell–Mankiw predicted income term carries any information about
‘true’ consumption growth beyond the information already contained in consumption persistence. In other words, the question is whether the sticky expectations model is a better model of consumption growth than the rule-ofthumb model after measurement error and transitory consumption have been
Kalman-filtered from the data.22
Table 5 presents the second-stage IV regression results. “True” consumption growth (as measured by the Kalman smoother) displays little correlation
with predicted income, especially when the regressions include a term reflecting
sticky expectations (or habit formation). All point estimates are much smaller
than the 0.5 estimated by Campbell and Mankiw (1989) and other authors.
The estimates of η are mostly statistically insignificant, and none exceeds 0.15.
Interestingly, the coefficient on lagged consumption growth changes very little
after adding predicted income and wealth to the univariate regression with
only consumption growth (compare the left and right panels of the table).
21

There is an interesting link between the signal-to-noise ratio from the estimated Kalman
filter models, var(∆ log Ct∗ )/ var(∆ log Ct ), in Table 4 and the first-stage R2 for consumption
growth from the IV regressions in Table 1. The correlation between the two statistics is
about 80 percent across countries, confirming that consumption growth can be predicted
better in the countries with smaller measurement error and transitory fluctuations.
22
The figures are interesting in ways that are independent of our analysis in this paper;
measurement errors seem to be systematically much larger in some countries than in others,
and for several countries appear to have declined markedly over time. These would be
interesting topics for future research, but are beyond the scope of our analysis.

3.2.1

Relationship with the Structural Estimation Literature

The state-space representation (7)–(8) fits nicely into the structural DSGE
framework recently proposed by Ireland (2004), who estimates a small (threeequation) log-linearized model with the Kalman filter. Control variables ft in
his model can be solved in terms of state variables st and residuals ut :
ft = Cst + ut .

(9)

Ireland, p. 1210 views the disturbances ut as follows: “the residuals [ut ] may . . .
soak up both measurement errors, but they can be interpreted more liberally
as capturing all of the movements and co-movements in the data that the real
business cycle model, because of its elegance and simplicity, cannot explain.”
Once we plug our transition equation for consumption growth (8) into the
measurement equation (7) the Kalman filter model we estimate above has
∗
, ut = ut + (θ −
exactly the structure (9) with ft = ∆ log Ct , st = ∆ log Ct−1
1)ut−1 − θut−2 + vt + λ1 (χ)vt−1 + λ2 (χ)vt−2 and C = χ.
Thus the state-space representation (7)–(8) can be interpreted as a strippeddown version of Ireland’s model with consumption habits in which measured
consumption is affected by a combination of measurement errors ut and shocks
vt to “true” consumption Ct∗ . As our main goal is to estimate consumption
stickiness χ, we do not take a stand on where the consumption shocks vt
come from (be it news about income, wealth, interest rates, fiscal policy or
something else).
Our model is simple enough to be estimable using the classical techniques,
including the maximum likelihood estimator. From one point of view, this
approach allows the data to have a complete control over the estimates of χ.
From another perspective, our estimates of χ could be used as an extra (outof-sample) information to calibrate priors about consumption sluggishness (or
habit persistence) in larger-scale Bayesian DSGE models. In fact, our Kalman
filter estimation could also be seen as a special case of the Bayesian framework
with uninformative priors.

Conclusions

Hall (1978) provided macroeconomists with a clean theoretical benchmark
against which actual consumption data could be compared: Consumption
growth should be essentially unpredictable. In contrast with this benchmark,
we find that, when econometric techniques that account for measurement error
are used, consumption growth exhibits a high degree of persistence or “momentum.” The stickiness of aggregate consumption growth can be interpreted
13

as reflecting the behavior of fully informed households with a strong consumption habit, or the behavior of an aggregate economy in which households are
not always perfectly up to date in their knowledge of macroeconomic developments. Fitting the model to data from thirteen countries, we estimate that
consumption growth persistence is always significantly above the random-walk
benchmark of 0 and is never robustly different from about 0.7. Our analysis
also suggests that, on balance, the model of sticky consumption growth describes aggregate consumption data better than the rule-of-thumb model of
Campbell and Mankiw (1989), although our point estimates do typically indicate that a modest proportion of households (in the range of 10–20 percent)
may simply consume their current income every quarter.
Our findings imply that the large literature claiming to find evidence of
sticky consumption growth in the U.S. probably cannot be explained away
as reflecting time aggregation problems or other mistreatment of the data,
suggesting that many of the insights gleaned from that literature are likely
applicable to other countries as well. (However, it is worth bearing in mind
that analyses that rely heavily on the literal interpretation of the habits-in-theutility-function framework, such as calculations of the welfare cost of aggregate
fluctuations, may not hold up under alternative interpretations of consumption
growth stickiness.)
Our analysis also strengthens a key policy message about the sluggish average response of consumption to monetary and fiscal policy innovations highlighted earlier in the context of the habit formation literature—an important
policy consideration at the current cyclical juncture in many countries, including in the United States.

Appendix A: Description of Data
Data for the G-7 economies are from the Haver Analytics database. Data for other
countries are from the database of the NiGEM model of the NIESR Institute, London. The original sources for most of these data are OECD, Eurostat, national
statistical offices and central banks. Income is measured as personal disposable income. Wealth is approximated using data on the net financial wealth. All series
were deflated with consumption deflators and expressed in per capita terms. The
population series are from DRI International and were interpolated from annual
data to quarterly observations. Japan is not included in our sample as creating a
quarterly dataset with consumption data going prior to 1980 would involve splicing consumption series based on three very different methodologies. Adjustments to
the Japanese national accounts methodology in 2002 and 2004 have significantly improved the reliability of quarterly consumption series but the current-methodology
data are only available since Q1:1994 (International Monetary Fund (2006)).
We thank Roberto Golinelli for consumer sentiment series for G7 countries and
Australia used (and described in detail) in Golinelli and Parigi (2004). (We have not
used consumer sentiment series for the remaining countries, because the data are not
available before 1985.) We are grateful to Carol Bertaut and Nathalie Girouard for
providing us with the data used in Bertaut (2002) and Catte, Girouard, Price, and
Andre (2004), respectively. Ray Barrell, Amanda Choy and Robert Metz answered
our questions about the NiGEM’s database.

respectively.
The state-space form is estimated with the Kalman filter using the consumption
series described in table 6. The coefficients λ1 and λ2 are not free parameters
but instead depend on the consumption persistence coefficient χ: λ1 = f (χ), λ2 =
g(χ) as detailed in the appendix to Sommer (2007). Our Kalman filter estimation
incorporates this relationship between χ, λ1 , and λ2 .
Figures 1 and 2 display the measured consumption growth ∆ log Ct and true
consumption ∆ log Ct∗ estimated using the Kalman smoother based on the above
state-space model.
