International Borring to Finance Investrrent

ABSTRPCT

The motives of a small country for borrowing to purchase capital
equipment on international markets are studied. The country produces tradable
capital and a nontradable consumption good and borrows or lends capital to
achieve higher levels of welfare. A shift in time—preference favoring future
over current consumption has an ambiguous impact effect on foreign debt.
Whether the country lends or borrows immediately depends upon whether the
consumption goods sector is capital or labor iitensive. Thedytiam±hirav-io-r--of
the current accouxit for an initially capital—pocr country is also derived. Our
results contrast with those of previous studies of optimal indebtedness in which
consumables are borrowed directly.

Introduction

This paper investigates the motives of a small country for borrowing in

order to purchase capital equipment on international markets. The country
produces capital and a non-traded consumption good, hut may wish to borrow or

lend capital to achieve a higher level of welfare. This analysis can be
distinguished from most examinations of optimal international indebtedness,

which focus on a consumption motive for borrowing.1 Although ultimately our
country would like to enjoy high levels of consumption, it cannot borrow
consumption goods directly.

We are particularly interested in the change in borrowing patterns as the
time horizon of individuals in the small country changes, and find
paradoxically that in some cases as a country saves more, it borrows more

internationally. A move toward giving more weiqht to the future might be
interpreted as a desire to forego current felicity in order to develop and

achieve higher long—run levels of well-being. Under the assumptions in this
paper, such a shift would lead to higher steady—state consumption at the
expense of current consumption.

In a model where borrowing is for consumption

(e.g., Obstfeld (1982)) such a cut would lead immediately to less borrowing or

more international lending by the small—country. In our model, in order to
cut current consumption, the capital stock employed in the consumption goods

industry must be reduced. If the consumer goods industry is capital—intensive
the country would reduce its capital stock immediately by lending abroad.
However, if consumption goods are labor—intensive then the overall capital

stock of the country must rise, which requires international borrowing. This
latter case offers a possible explanation for why a country that becomes more
future-oriented and wants to increase its long—run wealth may wish to increase

—2its foreign inlebtedness.

A second issue deals with the literature on stages in the balance of

payment. Fischer and Frenkel (1974) discuss a traditional argument which
asserts that a capital—poor country will go through stages in its balance of

payments as it grows. Initially the country borrows from the rest of the
world, hut as it matures it becomes a lender. It may reach a stage where it
has accumulated claims on other countries and finances a trade balance deficit

with earnings from those claims. Fischer and Frenkel demonstrate such a
phenomenon in a two—sector model in which consumption goods only are traded.

They assume a saving function which depends only on wealth. Bazdarich (1978),
however, shows that in the same context, but with optimizing consumers, there

are no stages of borrowing. This conclusion is reversed when borrowing occurs
to obtain capital. We show that optimizing agents in a capital poor country
may indeed initially borrow to increase their capital stock, but then run down

their debts over time. They could eventually become net owners of claims on
the rest of the world.

The two industries, capital goods and consumption goods, have constant
returns to scale technology and use labor and capital in the production

process. Both factors are freely mobile between industries. Capital can be
borrowed internationally at a qiven interest rate. Identical individuals
maximize discounted utility of consumption. The discount rate is determined
endogenously, and is parameterized as in Uzawa (1968). The endogeneity of the
discount rate is essential in allowing this economy to achieve steady—state.
With a constant discount rate, a small country with an infinite time horizon
that borrows at a given world interest rate will not have a convergent

consumption path toward a steady state (see Bardhan (1967)). The type of
preferences described by Uzawa allow convergence. In the international

—3—

context, Findlay (1978) and Ohstfeld (1981, 1982) have successfully modelled
optimal foreign borrowing under these assumptions.

The availability of capital at an exogenously determined world interest

rate fixes the shadow wage and rate of return to capital. When time
preference changes and the country wants to cut current consumption, its

pattern of borrowing is determined by the Rybczynski theorem.2 If the
consumption goods industry is capital intensive, a reduction in the country's

capital stock will shrink consumption and expand capital output. If capital
goods production is capital intensive, an expansion of the capital stock

through borrowing will reduce consumption output and increase manufacture of
capital goods.

It is also interesting to examine how the steady state rate of capital

imports is affected by a shift in time preference. In the long run, new
production of investment goods is used to replace capital that is depreciating

in both industries. If new investment is not sufficient to cover
depreciation, capital must be imported from abroad. When the country moves to
a higher level of steady—state consumption, steady—state production of

investment goods falls. This tends to raise the rate of capital flows from
abroad. Furthermore, if the consumption goods industry is capital intensive,
its expansion requires an expansion in the country's steady-state capital

stock. This, in turn, increases the amount of new capital required in order
to offset the depreciation of the capital stock, thus reinforcing the need for

more inflows of capital. On the other hand, if the consumption goods industry
is labor
must

intensive, steady-state capital,

fall.

and hence steady-state depreciation,

This reduces the need for imports of capital but this effect will

not outweigh the effect of reduced production of new investment goods.

Capital imports in the steady state must rise.

-4The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the
model and derives conditions for optimality. Section 3 examines the steady
state. The dynamics of foreign borrowing and capital accumulation are studied
in Section 4. Concluding remarks are in Section 5.

2. The Model

Identical individuals maximize discounted infinite horizon utility.

Utility is derived from a consumption good which is produced domestically and

is not traded. Capital and consumption goods are produced domestically using
capital and labor as inputs. Both factors are freely mobile between
industries. Each good has a constant returns to scale production function.
Capital may be borrowed internationally. The country is small, so that it
takes

the interest rate as given.
An individual 's

utility Ut at

each moment in time is related to

consumption ct:

Ut =

u(ct)

We assume

u'(ct) > 0

uu(ct) < 0 •

and

To avoid corner solutions, we postulate

We also assume

as in Uzawa.

For simplicity the total labor force is 1, and v is the amount of labor

employed in the sector that produces capital goods. The total amount of
capital in the economy is k, and in each sector k1 and k2, where the subscript

1 is for the investment goods industry and 2 for the consumption good. So,

k1 + k2 = k

In this equation -r represents the rate at which capital is imported from

abroad. If the country lends abroad, it acquires an asset, b. The rate of
return on lending is assumed to be exogenously given to the small country as

r-n. Therefore, the path of b is determined by

b =

Equation (9) gives the current account for this country.

We must impose the constraints

c>0, k>0, k2>0, v<1, k1>0, v>0
Given assumption (2), the first four constraints are never binding. The last
two may be binding. There could be specialization of production in the
consumption good. This possibility will he ignored in the text, and taken up
in Appendix 2.

Individuals also face the lifetime constraint:3

(10)

This constraint says that the amount of the small country's debt (_bt) must be
less than or equal to the sum of the discounted amount the country plans to

pay back each period (_-r). Without such a constraint, with the infinite
horizon planning problem an arbitrarily high level of utility could be
achieved by borrowing an arbitrary amount each period and meeting interest

payments through further borrowing. Given (11) we have

So, the constraint (10) may be written as

It will be shown that along the optimal trajectory described in this section
and section 4, condition (11) is satisfied.
From (4) we have the fact that

Using (12) and (13) necessary conditions for an optimum can be found by

and of the values of the marginal product of labor between

industries is guaranteed by (18) and (19) respectively, where Xô/q1 represents
the implicit price of consumption goods relative to capital goods.

down the labor—capital ratios in both industries. As new capital is injected
into (or drained out of) the economy, labor adjusts between the two industries

In order to express r as a function of the state variables alone, k must be

solved for the state variables. The constancy of the marginal products of
labor and capital imply that the (shadow) price of capital goods relative to

consumption goods must remain constant. By equation (32) we have

Equation (39) says that the excess of the country's growth in capital stock
plus depreciation over its new production of capital must be made up by
borrowing from abroad.

It is now possible to obtain a value for the objective function that

depends only on kt and bt. Substituting (15), (28), (30), (31), (32) and (39)

(14) gives the Hamiltonian at time t as an expression in kt and bt:

The next section examines the steady state of the model. The effect on
the steady state of a change in time preference is studied. Section 4 looks
at the dynamic evolution of the system given by (9), (38) and (39).

In both

of those sections (as in this section) attention will be focussed on the
economy when there is incomplete specialization in production.

3. The Steady State

It will be shown in the next section that the economy converges to a

steady state in which k, b and q are all zero. It is useful to examine the
properties of the steady state because the economy will, in the absence of
shocks, spend only a finite time outside a neighborhood of the steady state.

The condition that the costate variables be stationary in the long run
tells us from (21):

ô(u(c*)) =

r

—

n

.

(40)

Given the monotonicity of ô and ii, there is a unique level of consumption

associated with each real interest rate in the long run. Since consumption is
a function only of the capital stock, equation (40) also pins down the long—

run total domestic capital. More specifically, we have from (40) and (30)
that

will assume that k* lies between 1/ and 1/12. The case when k* lies

outside these bounds is taken up in Appendix 2.

(If the consumption goods

sector is capital intensive it can be shown that k* < i/li and if the

consumption goods sector is labor intensive k* > i/1. This follows because
assumption (2) rules out specialization in the investment good.)

there are capital imports from abroad in the steady state, then we must

hold a positive stock of foreign assets. The interest payments on these bonds
equals the amount of capital imports.

- 16

-

In section 2 the values for the control variables and the shadow prices
were determined as functions of the state variables. Their long run values
are therefore determined as the values of the functions evaluated at the
steady state levels of b and k.

We can now ask how steady state levels of consumption and capital imports

change as time preferences change. We will consider a shift in the ô function
so that the instantaneous discount rate

is lower for every level of

consumption. This is a movement toward giving more weight to the future. For
example, if a planner changed his behavior so as to value future consumption

more relative to current consumption, his discount rate would have fallen. We
might then say that this shift in the 6 function represents a policy shift
toward "development" -

if

by development is meant higher long run levels of

well-being.

It follows immediately from (40) and the assumptions made on 6(u(c)) in
(6) that

dc*/dÔ < 0

where

is a shift parameter in the 6 function. A shift down in the discount

rate must lead to higher steady state levels of consumption if relation (40)
is to hold.

An increase in steady state consumption requires from (16) an increase in

k2 given the constancy of £2. However, an increase in the capital used in the
consumption goods industry may require either an increase or decrease in the

economy's total capital stock. Figure 1 illustrates this point. The graph
shows the determination of k1 and k2 as the intersection of the lines of

equations (7) and (27). The top figure, in which the consumption goods

is capital intensive, shows that an increase in the total capital

stock k yields an increase in k2. However, when the consumption goods
industry is labor intensive, as in the bottom figure, k2 can increase only if

k falls. This is simply Rybczynski's theorem. Formally, from (29) we have

Li

The steady state level of capital imports is determined by the size of
the total capital stock and by the amount of capital devoted to the investment

goods industry. The shift down in ô(u(c)) reduces the size of the investment
goods sector, and thus increases the need for imports of capital to maintain

the nation's capital stock. If, in addition, the consumption goods sector is
capital intensive, then, from above, the total steady-state capital stock will

he larger. This implies even more imports to maintain the depreciating
capital stock. Thus, if the capital goods sector is labor intensive,
increasing patience will unambiguously raise steady state capital imports. By
equation (43) it will also increase the holdings of foreign bonds required in
the long run to maintain a zero current account.
If the consumption goods sector is labor intensive, then the increase in
the weight given to future consumption lowers the steady-state capital

stock. While this tends to reduce proportionally the need for capital imports
(in order to offset depreciation), the output of the local investment goods

industry shrinks more than proportionally, by the Rybcznski theorem. So,
steady—state capital imports still increase. The change in steady—state
capital imports for a given change in k2 (which is monotonically related to
the change in the level of consumption) is given by

In this section we examine the dynamics of the system outside the steady—

the

system adjusts in response

to a shift towards more patience. We saw in section 2 that the system could
be solved in terms of the two state variables h and k.

We

know that the long—run effect of increasing patience is to raise the

steady state capital stock if consumption is capital intensive and lower the

steady state capital stock if consumption goods are labor intensive. To get
the effect on the initial changes in the capital stock (and hence the initial

borrowing) we simply differentiate (48) holding wt constant. Recognizing that

we have that

Thus the initial change in the capital stock is always in the opposite

direction of the eventual change in the steady state capital stock. This
implies that initially there is a drop in consumption.
If the consumption goods industry is labor intensive, there must be an

initial increase in the capital stock that expands investment goods production

and contracts consumption goods production. In this case, the shift down in
the discount function (increased concern for the future) leads to foreign

borrowing initially. In the case in which consumption is capital intensive,
there will be foreign lending on impact.

These results can be understood more completely with the help of the

phase diagrams. Figure 3(a) is for the case in which consumption goods are

capital intensive. Here, the w = 0 line must slope upwards, and the shift
down in ó(u(c)) must lead to a higher steady state capital stock. The initial

— 21 -

labor

intensive), bond holdings, b, decline so that for all non—negative

levels of wealth, production in the consumption goods sector is positive.5
This follows because the marginal felicity of consumption is unbounded as

consumption falls to zero. Integrating backwards in the opposite direction,
consumption rises until the entire labor force and capital stock are employed
in the consumption goods sector (k =

1/12).

Thereafter, the economy is

completely specialized in the production of the consumption good and both
consumption and the capital stock rise backwards along an optimal path for

complete specialization in the consumption goods sector. The equations of
motion for k and b under complete specialization are given in Appendix 2.

Sufficient conditions for a path of k and b to be optimal are given by6

lim e q1k =

0

,

lirn e q2b1 =

0

.

(49)

The path that leads to the steady state is an optimal path. Thus, we will
concentrate on the dynamics along the saddle path. Notice that along the path

the intertemporal budget constraint expressed in (11) is satisfied. If
initial conditions are given which are not on the saddle path, then there will
be a jump in the state variables b and k, such that wealth remains constant.7
We now consider the effects of a change in time preference on the capital
stock and foreign bond holdings from an initial position of steady-state

equilibrium. There will be a jump in the state variables b and k at the time
of the changes in the 5 function, but total wealth, w, cannot jump

immediately. There may be at first a trade of some capital for some foreign
bonds (leaving wealth unchanged) or vice—versa. After this, state variables
will adjust smoothly.

steady state was at a point such as a. The change in time preference moves
the economy up the w = 0 line to a new steady state at point h.
(The w = 0 line does not shift with the change in the 5 function.) In order

to get onto the new saddle path from position a, this country must lend abroad
the amount of capital given by the distance aa'.

It then accumulates capital

and foreign bonds along the path to the steady state.
When consumption goods are labor intensive Figure 3(b) applies.

The w = 0 line slopes down, and the change in tine preference leads to a lower
steady state capital. However, initially there must be some foreign borrowing
that allows the capital stock to jump from a to a'. This is the case in which
a more future oriented economy would resort at first to some international

borrowing. After the jump to a', capital stocks fall, hut foreign bonds and
wealth accumulate along the path to steady state.
Next, consider a capital—poor country which initially has no external

debt or foreign bond holdings and begins to exchange freely capital goods and

bonds with the rest of the world. The country should initially issue debt and
import capital until it is on the saddle path with wealth equal to its initial

capital stock. It will then have a capital stock which is greater (less) than
the steady-state capital stock if the investment goods sector is capital—

intensive (labor—intensive). Adjustment towards the steady—state occurs as
the country runs a current account surplus and reduces its debt. In the
steady—state, the country has a balanced current account and can be either a

net debtor or creditor. In the latter case, it will have a trade account
deficit and service account surplus. If the country were capital rich, the
dynamics would follow a pattern opposite to the one described above. However,
the country may completely specialize in the production of the consumption

good until its capital stock falls sufficiently through depreciation so that
the value of the marginal product of caital is equal across sectors.

Figure 4 depicts a sequence of events that is consistent with Fischer and
Frenkel 's description of stages of the balance of payments. The country is
initially at a point such as x when its markets open up to free trade.

It

immediately runs a current account deficit and acquires capital as it moves

from x to y. This stage would correpsond to the young debtor stage described
by Fischer and Frenkel. As the country moves from y to z, it reduces its debt

to the rest of the world. It is a mature debtor in this stage. From z to the
steady—state, the country is a young creditor. It is a net creditor and is
increasing its claims on the rest of the world. At the steady—state the
country finances a deficit on trade account with interest payments on its
holdings of foreign debt.

It is a mature creditor with a balanced current

account.

5. Conclusion

This paper builds a simple framework in which factors are mobile within a
country, and only capital can be traded abroad in return for promises to repay

more capital in the future. In this set-up we found that a shift in time
preference toward a more future orientation leads to a cut—back in current
consumption levels as a means of obtaining higher long—run levels of

consumption. In a model in which only consumption goods can be lent or
borrowed this would imply an increase in lending abroad. But in our model the
drop in the level of activity in the consumption sector is accompanied by an

increase in domestic production of investment goods. In the case in which the

amount of capital that can profitably be reallocated from the consumption
sector is insufficient (the case in which capital goods production is capital
intensive) borrowing of machines from abroad must occur.

This model makes several special assumptions which could be relaxed.
Neary (1978) has criticized the assumption of perfect inter—sectoral factor

mobility in this type of model. Short-run specificity of capital might lead
to an adjustment motive for borrowing. It might also be useful to test the
robustness of the results of this paper by considering models with richer
trading opportunities.

Here we study the behavior of the system when the economy completely
specializes in production of the consumption good in steady state.

first-order conditions differ from the case of non—specialized

production in that the marginal products of labor and capital in the
consumption goods industry exceed those in the (non—existent) investment goods
industry. The marginal products, the labor/capital ratios in each industry
and the relative shadow price of the goods were all constant in the nonspecialized case, but all vary over time here.

Steady—state consumption is determined by

r

— n

Steady—state capital is given by

c = k*g(1/k*)

Finally,

nk* =

(r

gives us steady-state bond holdings.

As in the non—specialized case, dynamics can be studied by focusing on

the equations for k and w. We have immediately

w = k + b

=

(r

—

n)w

—

rk

The equation for k will require more work. Much of the derivation parallels
that in Appendix 1. The definitions of some of the symbols used here, and
some missing steps in the derivation are supplied in Appendix 1.
First, note that

rq = X8(g —

g'Jk)

Therefore

q/q =

q/q =

So, we have from the first-order conditions that X6 can be solved as a

function of k and w. This means the time derivative of Xô is a function of
k, w, k and w. But, we have already seen that w is a function of k and w.
So, the equation

[d(Xo)/dt]/Xo

[d(g

w)

The coefficient on w - w is negative. Thus, the k and w equations yield a

phase diagram qualitatively identical to that of Figure 2(a) —

the case in

which the consumption good is capital intensive. Here, moving backwards in
time from the steady—state, there may he a period in which both the
consumption good and capital good are produced.

As in Figure 3(a), an increase in concern for the future (a shift down in
the 6 function) leads to an immediate drop in the domestic capital stock as
capital is lent abroad.

Footnotes

'See, for example, Bardhan (1967, 1970), Obstfeld (1981, 1982) or

Dornbusch (1983). There are many similarities between the model in this paper
and the one in Obstfeld (1982). Obstfeld considers an economy with a constant
flow of non—produced income. His model is equivalent to a model in which a
schmoo good (can be used as consumption or capital) is produced. If capital
can be traded freely, output is constant at the level where the marginal

product of capital equals the world interest rate. Borrowing only occurs for
consumption purposes once output is fixed.
A previous paper that has investigated international borrowing in a
context in which capital goods are traded is Fischer and Frenkel (1972).

They

point out that if the capital stock is costlessly adjustable, and there is
free trade in consumption, capital and securities, that a country's capital

stock is indeterminate. They introduce an investment function, which suffices

to determine the stock of capital at any time. Here, we avoid the
indeterminacy because the consumption good is non-traded. Fischer and Frenkel
study the dynamics of capital accumulation with the assumption of a constant

saving rate. This paper investigates international borrowing under the
assumption that agents maximize utility of consumption.
A recent paper by Nunes (1983) considers a model in which capital goods

can be traded and there is optimal borrowing. The paper assumes a constant
discount rate and that the knife-edge condition holds that the discount rate
equals the world interest rate, so that there are no dynamics in consumption
expenditure.

2Rybczynsi1s (1955) theorem states that at constant prices, an increase
in one factor endowment will increase the output of the good intensive in that
factor more than proportionally and will reduce the output of the other good.

3See Arrow and Kurz (1970) and Obstfeld (1981, 1982) for discussions of
similar conditions.

4See Arrow and Kurz (1970). Equation (17) follows from the Kuhn—Tucker
conditions if borrowing is finite.
