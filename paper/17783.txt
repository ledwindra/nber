Boundedly Rational Dynamic Programming: Some Preliminary Results

ABSTRACT
A key open question in economics is the practical, portable modeling of bounded rationality. In this
short note, I report ongoing progress that is more fully developed elsewhere. I present some results
from a new model in which the decision-maker builds a simplified representation of the world. The
model allows to model boundedly rational dynamic programming in a parsimonious and quite tractable
way. I illustrate the approach via a boundedly rational version of the consumption-saving life cycle
problem. The consumer can pay attention to the variables such as the interest rate and his income,
or replace them, in his mental model, by their average values. Endogenously, the consumer pays little
attention to interest rate but pays keen attention to his income. One consequence of this is that Euler
equations will be biased, and the intertemporal elasticity of substitution will be biased toward 0, in
a manner that is quantitatively important.

A key open question in economics is the practical, portable modeling of bounded rationality. In this short note, I report ongoing progress that is more fully developed elsewhere
(Gabaix 2011, 2012).
The approach has at its core a model with boundedly rational (BR) features in which the
decision-maker (DM) builds a simplified representation of the world. This representation is
“sparse,” i.e., uses few parameters that are non-zero, or diﬀer from the usual state of aﬀairs.1
The DM may imperfectly maximize, based again on a penalty related to sparsity. Sparsity
is formulated so as to lead to well-behaved, convex maximization problems.
The model is a tractable algorithm that can be used to inject bounded rationality into
the basic models of economics. For instance, it delivers a way to model boundedly rational
dynamic programming. Given its tractability, it can be embedded in equilibrium, e.g., in
market equilibria with rational firms and boundedly rational consumers, and in general equilibrium. To illustrate the sparse framework, this paper uses the model to solve a canonical
consumption-savings problem.

Bounded Rationality in a 2-Period Problem

Consider for concreteness the following decision problem with just two periods: the DM’s
value function is:
 ( b  b ) =  () +  ((1 +  + b ) ( − ) +  + b ) 

and he wishes to max  ( b  b ). That is, the consumer starts from an initial wealth , and

picks his consumption  in order to maximize his utility, given that next period’s consumption
will be next period’s income,  =  + b , plus today’s savings,  − , compounded by the

interest rate,  =  + b . Here  is the average value of the interest rate (I take the default

value to be the average), and b is the (mean-zero) deviation of the interest rate from its

average; the same holds for , the average income, and b , the deviation of income from its

average.

A rational consumer will do: max  ( b  b ). What will a BR consumer do? Using

The meaning of “sparse” is that of a sparse vector or matrix. For instance, a vector in  ∈ R10000 with
only a few non-zero elements is sparse.

Figure 1: The anchoring-and-adjustment function 
a mix of psychological and economic reasoning, I propose in Gabaix (2011) a reasonably
systematic way of handling that. The DM trades oﬀ the cost of having an imperfect decision
against the benefits of saving on “thinking costs.” This leads to an algorithm that boils down
to the following procedure in our consumption-investment case.
First, the consumer knows what to do under a “default model” where (b
  b ) = (0 0),

i.e., all variables are at their average values. Then, the consumer has cognitive access to
 = −  at the default model, i.e., by how much consumption should change if the
interest rate goes up by a small amount. It may seem a bit strange that the consumer might
know so much, but this assumption captures parsimoniously the fact that people do have a
sense that some quantities (e.g., their income) matter a lot, while others (e.g., the volatility
of the 1-year interest rate and, perhaps, that interest rate itself) do not matter very much.
Step 1. Replace the interest rate b (to be more precise, the deviation of the interest

rate from its average) by its truncated version: the interest rate perceived by a BR agent is
(very shortly I will motivate and explain this particular formula):
b = 

Step 2 is unproblematic: given the perceived interest rate and income, the DM optimizes

consumption. The nerve of the model is in Step 1. To interpret rule (1), note that it implies:

That means: on average, a one-standard-deviation change in the interest rate makes the

BR agent change his consumption by only

standard deviations of consumption. If that

ratio is small enough (I calibrate the model to  = 03, so that features which account for

The penalty for lack of sparsity, , is akin to an index of bounded rationality: if  = 0,
the agent is fully rational.

rate was the average interest rate  rather than the true interest rate  . We have the
picture of a sensible agent: he does not pay attention to the interest rate all the time, he
saves (so he is not “myopic” in the sense of heavily discounting the future), but he does not
obsess about smoothing his consumption given all wrinkles to the interest rate. This agent
is arguably more sensible and realistic than the traditional agent (below I will oﬀer some
empirical evidence for that intuition).
Here, we use the “average values” for the interest rate and income shocks. In a one-shot

the agent will not take the wrinkles of the interest rate into account, but will pay attention
to changes in the interest rate only when changes are very large (e.g., if there is a large,
one-time discount of, say, cars).
The truncation rule embodies the idea that a DM who seeks “sparsity” (uncluttering
his mind from lots of small things) should sensibly drop relatively unimportant features: if
they account for less than  standard deviations of the actions, they are dropped entirely.

In addition, if the features are larger than that cutoﬀ, they are still dampened: in Figure
1,  ( ) is below the 45 degree line (for positive ; in general, | ( )|  ||). This
reflects Kahneman and Tversky’s “anchoring-and-adjustment” process, in which there is an
anchor in the default model, and then a partial adjustment toward the truth. This feature
could be abandoned, using the “hard-thresholding” function   ( ) = 1|||| instead:
2

The main paper provides a microfoundation based on the welfare loss from a suboptimal answer.

4

if ||  , then this is the 45 degree line,   ( ) = . However, the above function 
has the advantage of yielding continuous demand curves, which are likely in practice. For
many cases, the smooth adjustment makes more empirical sense than the “all-or-nothing”
adjustment, which predicts discontinuities that we are unlikely to see empirically.
I hope that the reader got a sense of the intuition for the model in a (quasi-)static context.
Let us now see how to proceed in more dynamic contexts.

2

Bounded Rationality in an Infinite-Horizon Problem

One important payoﬀ from the framework is that it allows for boundedly rational dynamic
programming (BRDP). This is important because many models in macroeconomics and
finance take the form of dynamic programming (Ljungqvist and Sargent 2004). The outcome
will be a model that is often simpler than the traditional model, because agents pay attention
to fewer things and, in particular, do not react to all future variables.
In addition, it is well-known that an important conceptual and practical problem when
dealing with dynamic programming is the curse of dimensionality. Strictly speaking, there are
perhaps over 1,000 state variables that should matter in our decisions, but solving dynamicprogramming problems with more than a few state variables (let alone 1,000 state variables)
is extremely hard in practice because of the combinatorial explosion of the problem’s complexity. Even the most powerful computers cannot handle such complexity and solve the
problems exactly. Given that, how would a boundedly rational agent proceed?
I illustrate the approach in a canonical consumption-investment problem. The agent

=0  
simple model, where the interest rate is constant at  (for simplicity, assume here that

 ≡ 1 +  =  −1 ) and his income is constant at : his wealth  evolves according to
+1 = (1 + ) ( −  ) +  (that is, wealth at  + 1 is savings at ,  −  , invested at rate

, plus current income, ). Then, the optimal consumption is  ( ) = ( + ) , and

the value function is   ( ) =  ( + )1− for a constant .
Now, the agent is told that the world is more complicated: the interest rate is actually
 + b and his income is  + b , where b and b are deviations of the interest rate and income
from their trends, respectively, and follow AR(1)s: +1 =  b + +1 and +1 =  b + +1 ,
5

where ·+1 are mean-0 disturbances. Hence, wealth follows:
+1 = (1 +  + b ) ( −  ) +  + b 

What will be the consumption function  (  b  b ) of a BR agent? It is diﬃcult, because

this is a dynamic-programming problem with 3 state variables, and has no closed forms.

Under the previous approach, one might think that one should solve for the value function

 (  b  b ); but that would be a very diﬃcult task in general: DP with 3 or more (and in

practice perhaps 20) state variables is very diﬃcult. However, we obviate this diﬃculty by
using the following algorithm.

Step A (Taylor expansion around the simple, default model with just one
state variable). We observe that a rational agent would consume, for small disturbances
b and b :
ln Rat (  b  b ) = ln  ( ) +  b +  b
+ 2nd-order terms.

(2)

Importantly, the terms  ,  are easy to derive by a local expansion of the simple, onedimensional value function   ( ) (i.e., without solving for the full function  (  b  b )).
Indeed, by perturbation arguments, which would be too long to describe here but are of
methodological interest,3 one finds:

the interest rate is not a very important decision for his consumption (| | is small).
Step B (Simplification of the reaction function). The DM does a BR truncation
of (2), according to formula (1). Hence, we obtain the following.
Proposition 1 A BR agent has the following consumption policy:

Formula (4) shows a “feature-by-feature” truncation. It is useful because it embodies in
a compact way the policy of a BR agent in a quite complicated world. Note that the agent
can do that without solving the 3-dimensional (and potentially 21-dimensional, say, if there
are 20 state variables besides wealth) problem. Only local expansions and truncations are
necessary.
In this manner, we arrive at a quite simple way to do BRDP. There is just one continuouslytunable parameter, . When  = 0, the agent is (to the leading order) the traditional rational
agent. When  is large enough, the agent is fully BR, and does not react to any variable.
Hence, we have a simple, smooth way to parametrize the agent, from very BR to (essentially)
fully rational.

Application: Insensitivity to the Interest Rates and Low Measured Intertemporal Elasticity of Substitution

To get a feel for the eﬀects, consider a calibration with:  = 1,  = 5%,  = 2,  = 1,
 = 08%,  = 02,  = 095, ln  = 5%, and  = 07 with yearly units: as income
shocks are persistent, they are important to the consumer’s welfare. Then, Figure 2 shows
the impact of a change in the interest rate and income on consumption. Consider the left
panel, 
 . If the cost of rationality is  = 0, then the agent reacts like the rational agent: if
interest rates go up by 1%, then consumption falls by 28% (the agent saves more). However,
for a sparsity parameter  ' 045, the agent essentially does not respond to interest rates.
Psychologically, he thinks “the interest rate is too unimportant, so let me not take it into
account.” Hence, the agent does not react much to the interest rate, but will react more

to a change in income (right panel of Figure 2), which is more important: the sensitivity
of consumption to income remains high even for a high cognitive friction . Note that
this “feature-by-feature” selective attention could not be rationalized by just a fixed cost to
consumption, which is not feature-dependent.
The same reasoning holds in every period. The above describes a practical way to do BR
dynamic programming. In some cases, this is simpler than the rational way (as the agent
does not need to solve for the equilibrium), and this may also be more sensible.
Let us sketch a consequence. For many finance applications (e.g., Bansal and Yaron 2004,
Barro 2009, Gabaix forth.), a high intertemporal elasticity of substitution (IES, denoted
 = 1) is important (  1). However, micro studies point to an IES less than 1
(e.g., Hall 1988). I show how this may be due to the way econometricians proceed, by

fitting the Euler equation, which yields ln +1 − ln  =   + constant, where b is the


measured IES. If the consumer “underreacts to the interest rate,” the measured IES will be
biased towards 0. Using the above model, we can more precisely calculate that if consumers
are boundedly rational (in the sense laid out above), the estimated IES will be : b =

The above calibration yields Figure 3, which plots the measured IES b if the consumer

is BR with sparsity cost . If  = 0, the consumer is the traditional, frictionless rational

agent. We see that as  increases, the IES is more and more biased. Hence, BR may explain
why while macro-finance studies require a high IES, microeconomic studies find a low IES.4

2.2

Application: Source-dependent Marginal Propensity to Consume

The agent has initial wealth , future income , he can consume  at time 1, and invest
the savings at a rate . Hence, the problem is as follows. Given an initial wealth , solve
P
max  =  () + E [ ( +  ( − ))], where income is  = ∗ + =1  : there are  sources

of income  with mean 0. Let us study the solution of this problem with the algorithm. The
P
DM observes the income sources sparsely: he uses the model  () = ∗ + =1   , with
 to be determined. Applying the model, we obtain (assuming exponential utility with
absolute risk aversion  for simplicity)
Proposition 3 Time-1 consumption is:  =

). The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) at time 1 out of income source  is:
  =   ·  

4

(5)

This is in the spirit of Gabaix and Laibson (2002)’s analysis of the biases in the estimation of the
coeﬃcient of risk aversion with inattentive agents, in a diﬀerent context and a more tractable model. See
also Fuster, Laibson and Mendel (2010) for a model where agents’ use of simplified models leads to departures
from the standard aggregate model.

9

where   = ( ) is the MPC under the BR model, and   = ( )
is the MPC under the traditional rational-actor model. Hence, in the BR model, unlike in
the traditional model, the marginal propensity to consume is source-dependent.
Diﬀerent income sources have diﬀerent marginal propensities to consume — this is reminiscent of Thaler (1985)’s mental accounts. Equation (5) makes another prediction, namely
that consumers pay more attention to sources of income that usually have large consequences,
i.e., have a high  . Slightly extending the model, it is plausible that a shock to the stock
market does not aﬀect the agent’s disposable income much — hence, there will be little sensitivity to it: the MPC out of wage income will be higher than the MPC to consume out of
portfolio income.
This model shares similarities with models of inattention based on a fixed cost of observing
information. Those models are rich and relatively complex (they necessitate many periods,
or either many agents or complex, non-linear boundaries for the multidimensional   rules,
or signal extraction as in Sims 2003), whereas the present model is simpler and can be
applied with one or several periods. As a result, the present model, with an equation like
(5), lends itself more directly to empirical evaluation. Some interesting “low-complexity”
models include Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer (2011) and Koszegi and Szeidl (2011). A
distinctive feature of the model presented in this note is its ability to handle continuous
choices (e.g., a consumption level) rather than the discrete choice between distinct goods.

Conclusion

I sketched here a practical way to do boundedly rational dynamic programming. It is portable
and to the first order has just one free continuous parameter, , the penalty for lack of
sparsity, which can also be interpreted as a cost of complexity. The model is easy to solve,
and avoids the curse of dimensionality. In ongoing research, I further develop this framework
in order to extend it to contexts of agents playing games and paying attention to equilibrium
market prices, and to study how bounded rationality can sometimes materially aﬀect the
conclusions drawn from the traditional model. Hence, we may be one step closer to having
a tractable, parsimonious enrichment of the traditional rational model that allows us to
explore when bounded rationality matters in economic situations.
