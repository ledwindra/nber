Does Returning to Work After Childbirth Affect Breastfeeding Practices?

NBER Working Paper No. 9630
April 2003
JEL No. I1
ABSTRACT
Although the Surgeon General recently highlighted breastfeeding as “……one of the most important
contributors to infant health,” few health economics studies based in developed countries have
considered breastfeeding as an important health behavior that can be influenced by labor market
decisions and by public policies. This study examines the effect of the timing and intensity of
returning to work after childbirth on the probability of initiating breastfeeding and the number of
weeks of breastfeeding. Data come from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79).
Baseline probit models and family-level fixed effects models indicate that returning to work within
3 months is associated with a reduction in the probability that the mother will initiate breastfeeding
by 16-18%. Among those mothers who initiate breastfeeding, returning to work within 3 months is
associated with a reduction in the length of breastfeeding of 4-6 weeks. We find less consistent
evidence that working at least 35 hours per week (among mothers who return to work within 3
months) detracts from breastfeeding. Baseline and fixed effects models indicate that returning to
full-time work is associated with a reduction in the length of breastfeeding of 1-4 weeks; however,
we do not find consistent evidence regarding the association between returning to full-time work and
breastfeeding initiation. Overall, the findings suggest that maternal employment is negatively
associated with both breastfeeding initiation and breastfeeding duration.

INTRODUCTION
As of the year 2000, 51% of mothers of infants less than 12 months old worked

outside of the home [1]. The number of employed mothers with infants has grown dramatically
since 1976, when the government first started to collect these data. Many researchers have
studied the effects of maternal employment on child development. Recent studies suggest that
some forms of maternal employment during the child’s first year may have negative effects on
children’s cognitive development and behavior problems, although these effects may be
outweighed by later benefits of having an employed mother [2-4]. There is much less research,
however, on the effects of maternal employment during the first year on the physical health of
infants and on maternal investments in infant health.
In particular, there is only limited, conflicting information about how maternal
employment affects breastfeeding decisions. Although there is some evidence that maternal
employment is associated with a reduced duration of breastfeeding among mothers who have
initiated breastfeeding, this association may be confounded by unobserved factors that affect
both breastfeeding duration and maternal employment decisions, such as cultural beliefs about
breastfeeding and the level of family stress. Moreover, little is known about how decisions about
employment after childbirth affect breastfeeding initiation. Breastfeeding initiation is an
important outcome to study, as a sizeable proportion of mothers (32% in 2000) do not initiate
breastfeeding at all [5].
The Surgeon General, in a report on breastfeeding published by the Department of
Health and Human Services in 2000, stated that breastfeeding is “…one of the most important
contributors to infant health [6].” Breastfeeding is linked to reductions in respiratory illnesses,
gastrointestinal illnesses, ear infections, asthma and other allergies, Sudden Infant Death
Syndrome, and childhood acute leukemia [7-11]. However, breastfeeding also is a timeintensive activity that requires mothers either to be with their children at every feeding, or to
4

express and store breastmilk for later use. Although many working mothers do feed their
children breastmilk, returning to work, particularly full-time work, shortly after the birth of a
child may make establishing and continuing with breastfeeding difficult.
This study is based on the hypothesis that among mothers who were employed before the
child was born, returning to work before the child is 3 months old (1) reduces the probability of
initiating breastfeeding and, (2) among mothers who initiated breastfeeding, reduces the number
of weeks of breastfeeding. We also hypothesize that among mothers who return to work within
3 months after childbirth, working full-time rather than part-time is associated with lower rates
of initiating breastfeeding and shorter breastfeeding durations. Unlike previous researchers, we
are able to take advantage of data on siblings, which allow us to examine breastfeeding and
employment decisions within mothers over time. Although this method has its own limitations,
we avoid the problem of needing to find good identifying variables, such as valid instruments in
an instrumental variables context.
The findings suggest that maternal employment is negatively associated with both
breastfeeding initiation and breastfeeding duration. Baseline probit models and fixed effects
models indicate that returning to work within 3 months is associated with a reduction in the
probability that the mother will initiate breastfeeding by 16-18%. Among those mothers who
initiate breastfeeding, returning to work within 3 months is associated with a reduction in the
length of breastfeeding by 4-6 weeks. This reduction may have significant health effects since
the median number of weeks of breastfeeding among mothers who initiated breastfeeding in our
sample was only 12 weeks. We find less consistent evidence that working at least 35 hours per
week (among mothers who return to work within 3 months) detracts from breastfeeding.
Baseline and fixed effects models indicate that returning to full-time work is associated with a
reduction in the length of breastfeeding of 1-4 weeks. However, we do not find consistent

5

evidence regarding the association between returning to full-time work and breastfeeding
initiation.

BACKGROUND
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that mothers breastfeed exclusively

(without the use of infant formula or other liquids) for the first six months, and then continue
partial breastfeeding for at least a year [12]. In 2000, about 68 percent of mothers in the United
States initiated breastfeeding in the hospital, and 31 percent were still breastfeeding (exclusively
or partially) when their infants were six months old. These rates are much higher than they were
even ten years prior, when only 52 percent of mothers initiated breastfeeding and 18 percent
breastfed for at least 6 months [5]. However, breastfeeding rates among African-American
mothers and mothers who participate in WIC still lag far behind the Healthy People 2010
objectives of increasing the breastfeeding initiation rate to 75% and the rate of breastfeeding for
5-6 months to 50% [13]. In 2000, 51 percent of African-American mothers initiated
breastfeeding in the hospital and 12 percent were still breastfeeding at six months; these rates
were 57 percent and 20 percent respectively for WIC participants in 2000 [5].
There is some empirical evidence that maternal employment may interfere with
breastfeeding. Visness & Kennedy (1997), for example, use 1988 data from the National
Maternal and Infant Health Survey and find that although returning to work within a year of the
child’s birth is not associated with breastfeeding initiation, returning to work is associated with
shorter duration of breastfeeding among those who initiate breastfeeding [14]. Similarly,
Lindberg (1996), using Cycle IV of the National Survey of Family Growth, find that part-time
working mothers are more likely to initiate breastfeeding and have longer breastfeeding
durations compared to full-time working mothers [15]. Fein & Roe (1998) also report that
expectations of full-time work during pregnancy and full-time work three months after childbirth
are associated with reductions in breastfeeding initiation and duration, respectively. Their work
6

is based on the Infant Feeding Practices Study, conducted in 1993 [16]. As the authors of these
papers acknowledge, the observed negative relationship between returning to employment and
breastfeeding may be confounded by reverse causality (e.g. the mother returns to work because
she has stopped breastfeeding) or by other unobserved factors, such as mothers’ unobserved
desire to wean the child.
Roe et al. (1999), however, find the same result after using methods that account for the
simultaneity of the employment and breastfeeding decisions [17]. These authors estimate a
simultaneous model of maternal employment and infant feeding, using maternal occupation to
identify the breastfeeding equation. They limit the analysis to mothers who have initiated
breastfeeding, who were employed before the child’s birth, and who planned to return to work
before the child was a year old (although the analysis includes women who changed their plans).
The results suggest that the duration of maternal leave is positively associated with the duration
of breastfeeding, and working 8 hours per day reduces the number of daily breastfeeding
sessions.
These results are based on the identification assumption that maternal occupation affects
return to work decisions but does not have direct impact on breastfeeding decisions. Although
the authors find that maternal occupation is not a significant predictor of breastfeeding practices,
certain occupations, particularly professional occupations where personal space for expressing
milk is available and many mothers breastfeed, may encourage a new mother to initiate or
continue to breastfeed. Work environment is likely to affect the ability to continue breastfeeding
and possibly the decision to initiate breastfeeding. Visness & Kennedy, in fact, report that among
white women, occupational category is associated with breastfeeding duration after controlling
for the duration of maternity leave. It is difficult to provide a strong argument for any personal
or family characteristics being a clearly good predictor of return-to-work decisions, but not

7

associated with breastfeeding decisions. In this study, because we have data on siblings, we
avoid the problem of needing to find suitable identifying variables.

THEORETICAL MOTIVATION
After the child’s birth, mothers maximize the following multi-period, discrete time

objective function:
T

∑ U (H , h , α , β )
t

t =0

t

t

t

subject to the following constraints and identities
H t = H t −1+ f t ( γ t , δ t , ε t )

H0 = H *
h t = h t −1 + g t (δ t , φ t )
h0 = h *
Z = β t + γ t + δ t + ηt
T

T

t =0

t =0

∑ (Et + η t w) = ∑ ( pα t + qε t + rφt ) + K + M
The utility in each period is a function of the mother’s health (H), the child’s health (h), the
mother’s consumption (α), and the mother’s leisure (β). The mother’s health in a period is a
function of her health in the last period with adjustments for the time she invests in health
producing activities in a given period (γ), the time she invests in her child’s health in a given
period δ, and the health care expenditures she makes (ε). A mother has an initial health
endowment of H* at t = 0.
Three additional points are notable with respect to δ. First, we are characterizing the time
investment in the child’s health as only including breastfeeding, and breastfeeding can affect the
mother’s health [18]. Second, we view the time invested in child health (i.e., time spent
8

breastfeeding) as being time above and beyond the time it would take for the mother to use
formula to feed the child. Although breastfeeding is not necessarily more time-consuming than
formula-feeding, we assume that breastfeeding requires more maternal time than formulafeeding (e.g. time spent expressing milk, fewer opportunities for another caregiver to feed child).
Third, to simplify the model, we consider only exclusive breastfeeding.
The child’s health in a period is a function of the child’s health in the last period with
adjustments for the time that the mother invests in the child’s health in a given period (δ) and the
medical care expenditures for the child (φ). The initial health endowment for the child is h* at t
= 0. Both f and g are subscripted because the investment in the child’s health through
breastfeeding has a dose response relationship and the marginal impact of breastfeeding on the
mother’s and child’s health will change over time. The dose response relationship suggests an
increasing marginal impact of breastfeeding on infant health when the child is very young, but,
eventually, the marginal impact will diminish and the marginal benefits will be lower than the
marginal costs of continuing to breastfeed.
The fifth constraint indicates that the total time available in a period (Z) is the sum of four
choice variables: time spent investing in the mother’s health, time spent investing in the child’s
health, time spent in leisure, and time spent working (η). The final constraint is a lifetime budget
constraint with an interest rate of 0—having any other interest rate would complicate the
expression without adding significantly to the insight. This is not meant to disallow saving and
borrowing—only to simplify the expression. The left hand side represents resources available:
the sum of endowments (or non-labor income) plus the wage multiplied by the time spent
working in each period. The right hand side represents expenditures. The first three terms that
are included in the summation over time are straightforward. The price of consumption goods is

p, the price of medical care for the mother is q, and the price of medical care for the child is r. K
and M require additional explanation
9

The decision to breastfeed at all and the decision on how long to breastfeed include
discrete costs that are only incurred if the mother decides to breastfeed (K=0 if δt = 0 ∀ t) and
only if the mother decides to breastfeed while working (M=0 if (δt = 0 or ηt = 0) ∀ t). The
decision to initiate breastfeeding involves start-up costs (K) above and beyond start-up costs
associated with formula feeding, such as purchasing nursing clothing and spending time and
effort learning about breastfeeding. The decision to breastfeed while working requires additional
start-up costs (M) such as the purchase of a breast pump and finding appropriate time and space
to express milk. The “startup” costs of breastfeeding are described only as financial in this case,
but they could be both financial and psychological.
Without these two discrete costs, the mother would have six choice variables since ηt
(work time) is implied by the other choices and the expression can be rewritten without ηt. The
choices include the time to invest in the mother’s health (γ), the time to invest in the child’s
health (δ), the mother’s medical care (ε), the child’s medical care (φ), leisure (β), and
consumption (α). As with any economic optimization problem, the mother will choose to
breastfeed until the marginal costs (in terms of the opportunity cost of time when the expression
is rewritten without ηt) are just equal to the marginal benefits (in terms of the effects on the
mother’s health, the effect on the child’s health, and savings on formula expenditures).
The two discrete costs allow corner solutions. First, a mother might choose to stop
breastfeeding when she returns to work rather than continuing to breastfeed longer if the fixed
startup cost of trying to breastfeed and work (M) is higher than the net marginal utility from
continuing to breastfeed after returning to work. In that case, the mother evaluates whether or
not to initiate breastfeeding by comparing two constrained optimization problems: breastfeeding
until she returns to work (δt = 0 ∀ t where ηt > 0) with a cost of K for initiating breastfeeding and
no breastfeeding (δt = 0 ∀ t).
10

Thus, while returning to work is a decision that is a choice variable similar to the choices
to initiate and continue to breastfeed, the discrete cost of trying to work and breastfeed leads to a
potentially clear directional relationship between the decision to return to work and to breastfeed.
A decision to return to work may limit the time spent breastfeeding. Furthermore, if the
incremental net benefit of breastfeeding (excluding M) that would occur after the return to work
were necessary to offset some part of K to make it worthwhile to breastfeed at all, then the
decision to return to work could also affect the decision on whether or not to breastfeed at all.

METHODS
This paper is based on the hypothesis that among mothers who were employed before the

birth of a child, returning to work, particularly full-time work, shortly after birth reduces the
initiation and duration of breastfeeding. To test this hypothesis, the study focuses on estimating
the following equation:
1) BFij = b0 + b1Eij + b2Xi + b3Yj+ ui + eij.
This equation is specific to the ith child of mother j. Two dependent variables (BF) are used in
this analysis: (1) a dichotomous indicator of whether or not the mother initiated breastfeeding;
and (2) among mothers who initiated breastfeeding, the log of the number of weeks the child was
breastfed. We have complete information on all breastfeeding spells, which eliminates the
problem of censored information about the dependent variable.
The main independent variable of interest is maternal employment status after the birth of
a child (E). We are primarily interested in two aspects of employment status: (1) the age of the
child in weeks when the mother returned to work; and (2) among mothers who had returned to
work by the time the child was three months old, the number of hours worked per week. We
consider both the timing of return to work and the intensity of the work effort because previous
research suggests that both of these factors may interfere with breastfeeding. To measure
employment status after birth (Eij), we use a dummy variable indicating whether or not the
11

mother returned to work before the child was three months old. For mothers who returned to
work within three months, we consider a dummy variable indicating whether or not the mother
worked full-time (at least 35 hours per week).2, 3
The vector Xi includes observed child-specific factors that may determine breastfeeding,
such as the child's gender and health endowment at birth, as proxied by low birth-weight, as well
as the child's birth order and year of birth. The child's year of birth is included to capture secular
trends in infant feeding practices. The vector Yj includes observed mother-specific factors that
may determine breastfeeding initiation and duration. These factors were selected based on
previous literature and include education, age, family size, Armed Forces Qualification Test
(aptitude test) score, marital status, family income, region of residence and whether or not the
family participated in the Food Stamp program. These variables are measured during the year of
the child's birth.
The models also include a measure of maternal smoking during pregnancy. It is not
expected that maternal smoking will directly affect the decision to breastfeed. However,
smoking during pregnancy may proxy the mother’s unobserved motivation to make investments
in infant health, such as breastfeeding. Maternal smoking, along with low birth weight and some
other right hand side variables, may be endogenous in the model because they may be correlated
with unobserved factors that are associated with both breastfeeding and employment decisions.
For this reason, all of the models also were estimated with a parsimonious set of covariates
(child’s race, year of birth, and mother’s aptitude test score).
Even with a rich secondary data set, there may exist important, unobserved factors that
affect breastfeeding decisions and that are not adequately captured by the available data. This

2

Our results are not sensitive to changing the full-time work threshold to 40 hours per week.
We also estimate these models using a continuous measure of the child’s age in weeks when his/her mother
returned to work and a continuous measure of the number of hours the mother worked per week when she returned
to work. In the paper, we do not present results from these analyses. These results are qualitatively very similar to
those presented here and are available upon request.

possibility is particularly relevant to this paper because the data set used in the study is a labor
market survey, which was not intended to focus on the determinants of infant feeding decisions.
The vector ui represents time-invariant, unobserved maternal factors that affect breastfeeding.
These factors may include the mother's cultural beliefs about breastfeeding, her mental and
physical health, her knowledge and interest in child health, and her social support system.
It is possible that some of these unobserved maternal factors that affect breastfeeding also
are correlated with unobserved factors that determine maternal employment after the birth of a
child. It is also possible that the employment and breastfeeding decisions are made
simultaneously, with breastfeeding decisions affecting employment decisions and employment
decisions affecting breastfeeding decisions. For example, mothers who do not intend to
breastfeed their infants might be more likely than mothers who intend to breastfeed to
return to work shortly after the birth. Because intention to breastfeed is unobserved,
standard estimation of equation 1 would lead to a biased estimate of the impact of maternal
employment on breastfeeding, since, in this scenario, mothers who return to work shortly
after the birth are more likely than other mothers to not intend to breastfeed.
Initially, ordinary least squares (OLS), and standard probit models are used to
estimate equation 1. Estimating equation 1 by OLS or a standard probit, however, can lead
to biased and inconsistent estimates if these endogeneity problems exist. This study uses
two approaches to address this problem. First, observed data on maternal characteristics is
used to proxy uj to the fullest extent possible, and we use informal and formal tests to assess
whether or not the problem of unobserved heterogeneity is important. The informal test consists
of comparing results from parsimonious and more fully specified models of breastfeeding. If
controlling for observed heterogeneity affects the estimated impact of maternal employment on
breastfeeding, it seems likely (although we can never know for certain) that unobserved
heterogeneity also is important in this relationship. More formally, we also use the Breusch13

Pagan Lagrange Multiplier test to determine whether or not the disturbance term includes a
group-level component.
These tests suggest that unobserved heterogeneity may be important in the relationship
between maternal employment and breastfeeding. Therefore, we attempt to account for
unobserved mother-specific factors by estimating family-level fixed effects models. These
models take advantage of the fact that most mothers in the data have multiple children.
Consequently, we have repeated observations on employment and breastfeeding decisions for
much of the sample. Ideally, we would have used random effects models to account for a
random, unobserved mother-specific factor that affects breastfeeding and employment decisions.
However, a Hausman test rejected the null hypothesis that the right hand side variables in the
model were exogenous with respect to the error term, which indicates that the random effects
model would not lead to consistent estimates of the parameters.
Fixed effects models are robust to correlation between right-hand side variables and the
disturbance term. These models also address the problem of time-invariant, mother-specific
factors, such as the mother’s fixed, cultural beliefs about breastfeeding. However, because these
models are based on “within” variation only, we cannot estimate the impact of time-invariant
factors, such as race and aptitude test score, on breastfeeding. Moreover, we cannot account for
unobserved, mother-specific factors that might change between the birth of two children, such as
her level of family stress. It is possible that the causation runs the opposite way, with mothers
returning to work later because they are breastfeeding. Roe et al. find little empirical support for
this direction of causality, but it remains a possibility. The fixed effects models will not
eliminate this simultaneity problem if the unobserved factor that governs both decisions, such as
the intention to breastfeed, is time-varying. This issue suggests that these findings should be
interpreted and generalized with caution.
A Breusch-Pagan test based on a standard fixed effects model shows evidence of
14

heteroscedasticity in the random component of the error term. For this reason, a heteroscedastic
fixed effects model is estimated using feasible generalized least squares. This model allows for
family-specific variances, but not for cross-sectional correlation within panels. A standard fixed
effects model led to very similar results.
This study does not use the instrumental variables (IV) method or the bivariate probit
model to address the problem of unobserved heterogeneity. These methods do have certain
advantages over the fixed effects models, but practical implementation of these methods
requires that we have at least one exogenous variable that is a predictor of the maternal
employment decision after the birth but is not correlated with either breastfeeding or the
error term in the breastfeeding equation. Unfortunately, there are few, if any, characteristics of
the mother or family that would be appropriate as identifying instruments. Roe et al. (1999), in
their study of maternal employment and breastfeeding, identify their breastfeeding equation
using occupational category as an identifying instrument. It seems likely, however, that
occupational category also affects breastfeeding decisions since some occupations (e.g.
professional) offer more flexibility and personal space than other occupations (e.g. clerical).
Although no national survey of workplace attitudes towards breastfeeding exists, small-scale
surveys indicate that employers generally do not view providing breastfeeding support as a
priority and attitudes towards breastfeeding vary by employer characteristics such as firm size
[19-20].
State-level policies are more likely than individual-level characteristics to be exogenous.
However, state-level policies are likely to be very poor predictors of individual mothers’
decisions to return to work. Bound et al. (1995), Bollen et al. (1995), Nelson & Startz (1990),
Staiger & Stock (1994) and others all have noted that a low first stage F-statistic for the
identifying instrumental variables may suggest that the TSLS estimates are no better than biased
OLS estimates [21-24].

DATA
Data used in the study come from the 1998 releases of the National Longitudinal

Survey of Youth (NLSY79) and the Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth
(CoNLSY). NLSY79 is an annual, national survey that was initiated in 1979 with a sample of
12,686 young people who at that time were aged 14-21. The original sample includes a
nationally representative sample of civilian youth as well as over-samples of African-Americans,
Hispanics, indigent Whites, and Armed Forces personnel. Children of NLSY79 mothers
(CoNLSY respondents) are interviewed and/or assessed in a separate, linked survey. We limit
the sample to children born before 1997 in order to have data on completed breastfeeding spells
for all children. As of 1996, 7,103 CoNLSY respondents ranging in age from infant to over 21
years old were assessed and/or interviewed. Of these 7,103 respondents, 21% were Hispanic,
33% were African-American, and 46% were White/Other.
Two analysis samples are used in this study: (1) the full sample (N=5,804), which
includes children born between 1974 and 1996 to mothers who were employed full-time or part-

time at some point during the year that preceded the child’s birth; and (2) the sibling sample
(N=3,947) which limits the full sample to children who have at least one sibling in the sample.
The sibling sample is used to estimate family fixed effects models. We limit both samples to
children born to mothers who were employed before the birth of the child in order to focus on
how the timing and intensity of return to work affects breastfeeding decisions. When we focus
on the intensity of return to work, we limit the sample to children of mothers who returned to
work within three months after the birth of the child. When we analyze breastfeeding duration as
an outcome, we limit the sample to children whose mothers initiated breastfeeding.
Both samples exclude observations with missing data on breastfeeding or missing data on
the mother’s employment status during the year before or during the year after the child’s birth.
The samples include respondents with missing data on Food Stamps participation, birth weight,
16

education, family income, marital status, family size, AFQT score, and smoking during
pregnancy. For these respondents, missing variables are replaced by unconditional means. In
order to check the sensitivity of the results to this imputation, the models were re-estimated after
dropping respondents with missing information. The results were almost identical to those
presented here, and suggest that the results are not sensitive to the imputation method used to
deal with missing data.

DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
Table 1 presents means and standard deviations for the full and sibling samples. In both

samples, about 23% of the respondents are African-American and about 19% are Hispanic. The
average maternal age is 25, and the average number of years of education is 12.6. Most mothers
(about 70%) were married at the time of the birth, and about 31% reported smoking during
pregnancy. Employment after the birth of the child was common in both samples, with 55-59%
of mothers returning to employment within 3 months after the child’s birth, but only 34-36% of
the samples returned to full-time work before the child was 3 months old. Klerman & Leibowitz
using 1986-1988 data from the Current Population Survey find that about 40 percent of new
mothers return to work within three months, but their sample includes part-time workers and
mothers who were not working before the child’s birth [25]. (The mean year of birth in our
sample is 1986.) About 51% of each sample initiated breastfeeding, and, among those who
initiated, the mean duration of breastfeeding was 18-19 weeks.
Table 2 presents means and standard deviations by the mother’s employment status after
the child’s birth. Columns 1-2 compare maternal characteristics between mothers who returned
to work before the child was 3 months old and mothers who did not. Columns 3-4 compare
maternal characteristics between mothers who returned to work full-time within 3 months after
the birth and mother who had returned to work within 3 months, but not full-time.

17

The timing of return to work (Columns 1-2) appears to be associated with breastfeeding
duration, but not initiation. Mothers who returned to work within 3 months were just as likely to
initiate breastfeeding, but they breastfed for about 3.5 fewer weeks than mothers who did not
return to work within 3 months. There were other interesting differences between the two
groups. Mothers who returned to work within 3 months were older, more educated, more likely
to be married, had higher family income and were less likely to have smoked during pregnancy
compared to mothers who did not return to work within 3 months. These differences were
consistent, but less striking, when the comparison is made between full-time working mothers
and mothers who were working within 3 months, but were not working full-time (Columns 3-4).
Working full-time, however, appears to be associated with decreased likelihood of breastfeeding
initiation and a decline of about 5 weeks of breastfeeding. These findings suggest that the small
differences in breastfeeding between these groups of mothers may be confounded by the higher
socioeconomic status of mothers who return to work shortly after childbirth.
Table 3 displays a more detailed breakdown of breastfeeding patterns by return-to-work
status. As the top panel of Table 3 shows, mothers who return to work within a month after
childbirth are only slightly less likely to initiate breastfeeding than mothers who return later.
Mothers who return to work when the child was 1-3 months old, however, have lower rates of
breastfeeding initiation than mothers who did not return to work within 3 months. There was no
consistent pattern between the timing of return to work and breastfeeding duration. As the
bottom panel of Table 3 demonstrates, there is a much stronger relationship between hours
worked and breastfeeding among mothers who had returned to work within 3 months after
childbirth. The number of hours worked is inversely associated with both breastfeeding
initiation and duration. These results suggest that the timing of return to work may or may not
be important in breastfeeding decisions, but among mothers who return to work within 3 months,

18

working more hours detracts from breastfeeding. Clearly, other observable and unobservable
factors may confound these relationships.
Fixed effects models rely solely on within-family variation in employment and
breastfeeding practices since all other variation is eliminated from the model. Tables 4a and 4b
assess whether or not there is sufficient within-family variation in the data. For clear
presentation, the tables focus only on breastfeeding initiation and only on families with 2
children. We note, however, that there is much more scope for variation within larger families
(which essentially have more repeated observations) and when the number of weeks of
breastfeeding is considered as an outcome. Our assessment of within-family variation therefore
focuses on the scenario where within-family variation is likely to be the lowest. Approximately
67% of the children in the sibling sample lived in 2-child families.
Table 4a shows variation within 2 child families in returning to work within 3 months,
initiating breastfeeding, and returning to full-time work within 3 months. About 35% of mothers
returned to work within 3 months with one child, but did not return within 3 months with another
child. Approximately 31% of mothers worked full-time before one child was 3 months old, but
did not work full-time within 3 months with another child. Variation in breastfeeding initiation
within families was less common; only about 19% of mothers initiated breastfeeding with one
child but not with another child.
Table 4b limits the comparison to mothers who show variation between two children in
both breastfeeding initiation and work decisions after childbirth. These “switchers” actually
determine the estimate of maternal employment on breastfeeding in the fixed effects models.
Within 90 switcher families, about 41% of mothers initiated breastfeeding when the mother
returned to work within 3 months, while about 59% of mothers who did not return to work
within 3 months initiated breastfeeding. However, within switcher families, full-time work did
not appear to negatively affect breastfeeding decisions. The fixed effects models presented in
19

the next section enhance this simple comparison by controlling for time-varying and time
invariant covariates, such as the mother’s marital status and the birthweight of the child, that may
confound these relationships.
Regression diagnostics revealed that one of the dependent variables, the number of weeks
the child was breastfed, was highly right skewed. Once this variable was transformed to its
natural log form, several regression problems were solved at once, including a problem of nonnormal error distribution and several influential data points. For this reason, all weeks breastfed
models were estimated in semi-log form.

ESTIMATION RESULTS
Tables 5 and 6 show estimates of the timing of return to work (Table 5) and the intensity

of return to work (Table 6) on breastfeeding initiation and breastfeeding persistence. Columns 13 in each table focus on the initiation of breastfeeding as an outcome, while columns 4-6 in each
table show results from models in which the log of the number of weeks breastfed is the
dependent variable. The weeks breastfed models are limited to children whose mothers initiated
breastfeeding. All of the models in Table 6, which focuses on the intensity of work, are limited
to children whose mothers returned to employment before they were three months old.

Timing of Return to Work and Breastfeeding
Column 1 in Table 5 shows results from a parsimonious model of breastfeeding initiation.
This model includes as independent variables a dummy indicator of whether or not the mother
returned to work before the child was 3 months old, race, the year of the child’s birth, and the
mother’s aptitude test score. Column 2 expands this model to include a larger number of child
and maternal characteristics, some of which are potentially endogenous. In both the
parsimonious and fully specified models, returning to work within 3 months is associated with a
decrease in the probability of .08 -.09 in the probability of initiating breastfeeding. At the

20

sample means, this reduction translates into a 16-18 percent decrease in the probability of
initiating breastfeeding.
The inclusion of additional covariates (Column 2) has little impact on the magnitude of
the estimated impact of returning to work on breastfeeding initiation. Many of the additional
covariates, however, appear to be important predictors of breastfeeding initiation. Older, more
educated, and married mothers are more likely than others to initiate breastfeeding. AfricanAmerican and Hispanic mothers are less likely than mothers of other races and ethnicities to
initiate breastfeeding. Children who are first-born are more likely to be breastfed, and low
birthweight children are much less likely to be breastfed. Mothers who report smoking during
pregnancy are less likely to initiate breastfeeding. It appears that selection along unobserved
characteristics may not be particularly important because: (1) observed maternal and child
characteristics are good predictors of breastfeeding initiation; and (2) the inclusion of these
characteristics does not have much impact on the estimate of maternal employment on
breastfeeding initiation.
If selection on observed characteristics is not particularly important, it seems unlikely
that selection on unobserved characteristics is important [26]. This informal test suggests that
controlling for unobserved heterogeneity may not be important in this context, but it is by no
means a definite indication of the importance of unobservable factors. In this case, in fact, a
Breusch-Pagan Lagrange Mulitplier test for random effects suggested that the disturbance term
includes a mother-specific error component. This finding is consistent with breastfeeding
research, which suggests that mother-specific factors that are difficult to measure in a secondary
data set, such as a mother’s cultural beliefs about breastfeeding, are very important in the
decision to initiate breastfeeding. For this reason, we estimate a fixed effects model using a subsample of the data that only includes children of mothers with more than one child. This model

21

differences out the fixed, mother-specific component of the error term, leaving an unbiased
estimate of the impact of returning to work on breastfeeding initiation.
Column 3 of Table 5 shows fixed effects model results. The models ignore the fact that
the dependent variable is binary. A random effects probit would have accounted for the binary
dependent variable, but a Hausman test suggested the existence of correlation between right hand
side variables and the disturbance term. For this reason, a standard fixed effects model was
estimated. (It was not possible to test for heteroscedasticity because of the large number of
mothers in the sample.) The fixed effects model results are consistent with the baseline probit
results – returning to work within 3 months is associated with a reduction in the probability of
breastfeeding. It is difficult to interpret the magnitude of this estimate, however, since the binary
nature of the dependent variable was ignored.
Columns 4, 5 and 6 present results of models in which the log of the number of weeks
breastfed is the dependent variable. These models are limited to children whose mothers
initiated breastfeeding. Columns 4 and 5 present findings from a parsimonious OLS model and a
fully specified OLS model. As before, the inclusion of a full set of covariates does not change
the magnitude of the coefficient on maternal employment very much. In both models, returning
to work before the child is 3 months old is associated with a 33-34% decrease in the number of
weeks of breastfeeding, among children whose mothers initiated breastfeeding. At the sample
means, this percentage decrease translates into 6 fewer weeks of breastfeeding.
Older, more educated, married mothers breastfed their infants longer than younger, less
educated, unmarried mothers. First-born children actually were breastfed for fewer weeks than
later-born children, even though previous results showed that mothers were more likely to
initiate breastfeeding with first-born children. Mothers who smoked during pregnancy breastfed
their infants for fewer weeks compared to mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy. As in

22

the breastfeeding initiation models, maternal smoking during pregnancy may represent a
mother’s lack of knowledge or interest in child health.
As before, a Breusch-Pagan Lagrange Multiplier test supported the existence of a fixed,
mother-specific component in the disturbance term, and a Hausman test suggested that fixed
effects models rather than random effects models are appropriate in this case. In the
breastfeeding duration models, however, the sample size was reduced because the models were
limited to children whose mother initiated breastfeeding. The smaller sample size allowed us to
perform a Breusch-Pagan test for heteroscedasticity in the standard fixed effects model. Because
we did find evidence of heteroscedasticity, we estimated a heteroscedastic fixed effects model,
which allows for mother-specific variances.
Findings from the heteroscedastic fixed effects model support the baseline results.
Returning to work within 3 months is associated with a 22% decrease in the number of weeks of
breastfeeding, among mothers who initiated breastfeeding. At sample means, this percentage
decrease represents a reduction in breastfeeding of about 4 weeks. In summary, then, all of the
models support the idea that returning to work within 3 months of childbirth is associated with a
reduced probability of initiating breastfeeding and, among mothers who initiate breastfeeding, a
reduction of 4-6 weeks in the duration of breastfeeding.

Intensity of Return to Work and Breastfeeding
It is assumed that returning to work interferes with breastfeeding because both activities
are time-intensive. Because working full-time is clearly more time-intensive than working parttime, it is possible that among mothers who return to work within 3 months, working more hours
may have more detrimental effects on breastfeeding than working fewer hours. The descriptive
statistics presented in Table 3 show that full-time, working mothers are less likely to breastfeed
than part-time working mothers. However, in Table 4b, there does not appear to be a clear trend

23

in the rate of breastfeeding within mothers who had different working intensity between 2
children.
Table 6 presents results from models that are limited to mothers who returned to work
within 3 months after childbirth. Columns 1-3 show findings from models of breastfeeding
initiation, while columns 4-6 show results from models with log of the number of weeks of
breastfeeding as the dependent variable. All of the baseline results (columns 1-2 and 4-5)
suggest that among mothers who returned to work within 3 months, working full-time reduces
the probability of breastfeeding by about 18% and reduces the number of weeks of breastfeeding
by about 4 weeks (among those who initiated breastfeeding). The comparison group includes all
mothers who returned to work within 3 months, but were working less than 40 hours a week.
The median hours worked in the comparison group was 25 hours per week.
The fixed effects models (Table 6, columns 3 and 6) do not completely support these
results. The models suggest that working full-time may have a negative impact on the number of
weeks of breastfeeding of about 1 week among mothers who initiate breastfeeding (column 6).
This result is consistent with our previous findings. However, after differencing out an
unobserved, mother-specific effect, working full-time appears to have a positive association
(rather than a negative association) with breastfeeding initiation (column 3). This positive result
is inconsistent with both the theoretical motivation and all of the other empirical results in this
paper.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Breastfeeding is one of the most important maternal investments in infant health during

the first year of life, but very few health economics studies focused on the United States consider
breastfeeding as a health behavior that can be influenced by labor market decisions and by public
policy. This study provides evidence that return to work decisions after childbirth can have
important effects on breastfeeding. Therefore, policies that affect return to work decisions after
24

childbirth, through their effects on breastfeeding, have considerable potential to improve infant
health. We find that returning to work within the first three months of the infant’s life is
associated with a reduction in the probability of initiating breastfeeding by 16-18 percent, and a
reduction in the duration of breastfeeding by 4-6 weeks among mother who initiate
breastfeeding. Full-time work among mothers who return to work within 3 months has no
consistent effect on breastfeeding initiation, but it is associated with a reduction in the duration
of breastfeeding of about 1-4 weeks.
Our results are novel and policy-relevant for several reasons. First, we use data on
siblings, which allows us to build on previous literature on employment and breastfeeding by
addressing the problem of unobserved heterogeneity without relying on potentially weak
identifying variables. Past studies, with the exception of Roe et al., ignore the problem of
unobserved heterogeneity. Our results on the effects of return to work decisions on
breastfeeding duration are consistent with previous work, which suggests that the length of
maternity leave and the number of hours worked are positively associated with breastfeeding
duration.
We also consider the effect of return-to-work decisions on breastfeeding initiation. This
outcome is important to address because: (1) a sizable proportion of mothers do not initiate
breastfeeding; (2) as we describe, theory suggests that returning to work can affect initiation; and
(3) most previous research focuses on the effect of employment on breastfeeding duration among
mothers who have already initiated breastfeeding. We find that returning to work within 3
months detracts from breastfeeding initiation. Because the decision to breastfeed is made
immediately after childbirth, we interpret this association as a mother’s plans to return to work
within 3 months (which we cannot measure directly) having a negative association with
breastfeeding initiation. Plans to return to full-time work rather than part-time work do not
appear to have a consistent association with breastfeeding initiation.
25

Finally, the magnitude of the associations we find are large and important from a public
health perspective. A reduction in breastfeeding duration of six weeks implies that, at the mean,
a mother would stop breastfeeding her child when he is between two and three months old
instead of when he is about four months old. Clinical literature suggests a dose response
relationship between the length of breastfeeding and health benefits for infants such as decreased
otitis media, acute respiratory infection, diarrhea, gastroenteritits, and allergic disease [27-30],
although these findings are not universal [31]. Our results suggest, therefore, that decisions
about employment after childbirth, through their impact on breastfeeding, may have important
ramifications for infant health.
