ABSTRACT
The Melitz model highlights the importance of the extensive margin (the number of firms
exporting) for trade flows. Using the World Bank's Exporter Dynamics Database (EDD)
featuring firm-level exports from 50 countries, we find that around 50% of variation in exports is
along the extensive margin --- a quantitative victory for the Melitz framework. The remaining
50% on the intensive margin (exports per exporting firm) contradicts a special case of Melitz with
Pareto-distributed firm productivity, which has become a tractable benchmark. This benchmark
model predicts that, conditional on the fixed costs of exporting, all variation in exports across
trading partners should occur on the extensive margin. We find that moving from a Pareto to a
lognormal distribution allows the Melitz model to match the role of the intensive margin in the
EDD. We use likelihood methods and the EDD to estimate a generalized Melitz model with a
joint lognormal distribution for firm-level productivity, fixed costs and demand shifters, and use
"exact hat algebra" to quantify the effects of a decline in trade costs on trade flows and welfare in
the estimated model. The welfare effects turn out to be quite close to those in the standard MelitzPareto model when we choose the Pareto shape parameter to fit the average trade elasticity
implied by our estimated Melitz-lognormal model, although there are significant differences
regarding the effects on trade flows.

THE INTENSIVE MARGIN IN TRADE

1.

Introduction

Across trading partners, exports can vary along the extensive margin (number of exporting firms)
and along the intensive margin (average exports per exporting firm). The classic Krugman (1980)
model predicts all export variation will be on the intensive margin because all firms export to every destination. Melitz (2003) brings the extensive margin to life with fixed costs of exporting,
and emphasizes the importance of selection of firms into exporting.
In this paper we document the importance of the two margins empirically and then study
the implications of our findings for quantitative trade theory. Exploiting data on a much larger
set of exporting countries than in the existing literature,1 we find that the intensive margin is
at least as important as the extensive margin in driving bilateral trade flows. The importance
of the intensive margin is at odds with the Melitz model if one assumes that firm productivity is distributed Pareto, as is customary in the quantitative trade literature. In the benchmark
Melitz-Pareto model, the extensive margin is dominant. In contrast, a lognormal distribution of
productivities allows the Melitz model to successfully match the empirical prominence of the
intensive margin. We finish by examining whether moving from a Pareto to a lognormal firm
productivity distribution alters how trade costs affect trade flows and welfare.
To elaborate, we use the World Bank’s Exporter Dynamics Database (hereafter EDD) to systematically examine the importance of the extensive and intensive margins. The EDD covers
firm-level exports from 59 (mostly developing) countries to all destination countries in most
years from 2003 to 2013. For 49 of the countries, every exporting firm’s exports to each destination in a given year can be broken down into HS 6-digit products.2 We add China to the 49
EDD countries to arrive at 50 countries for our analysis. Having many origin and destination
countries enables us to study the role of the intensive and extensive margins while allowing for
origin-year and destination-year fixed effects that control for differences in population, wages,
and other country characteristics that affect firm entry into exporting and exports per firm.
We find that between 40 and 60 percent of the variation in overall exports across origindestination pairs is accounted for by the intensive margin, with the rest accounted for by the
extensive margin. For reasons that will become clear in Section 2, we refer to these two shares
as the intensive margin and extensive margin elasticities. This breakdown into the intensive and
extensive margin elasticities is robust to using different country samples or sets of fixed effects,

Most firm-level empirical trade studies have only one or at most a few exporting countries. Bernard, Jensen,
Redding and Schott (2007) decompose exports from the U.S. to other countries. Eaton, Eslava, Kugler and Tybout
(2008) analyze firm-level exports for Colombia, Eaton, Kortum and Kramarz (2011) do so for France, Eaton et al.
(2012a) for Denmark and France, Manova and Zhang (2012) for China, and Arkolakis and Muendler (2013) for Brazil,
Chile, Denmark and Norway.

excluding country pairs with few exporters or tiny exporters, and looking within industries.
We interpret the finding that up to 60 percent of the variation in bilateral trade flows are explained by the extensive margin as providing support for the Melitz (2003) model. But the finding
that at least 40 percent of that variation is explained by the intensive margin — even while allowing for origin-year and destination-year fixed effects — contradicts an important special case of
the Melitz model, namely the one with Pareto-distributed firm productivity and fixed trade costs
that vary only because of separate origin and destination components. In this case all variation
in exports across trading partners should occur through the number of exporters (the extensive
margin). Lower variable trade costs should stimulate sales of a given exporting firm, but draw in
marginal exporting firms to the point that average exports per exporter (the intensive margin) is
unchanged. This exact offset is a special property of the Pareto distribution.3
We explore several potential explanations for the prominent intensive margin in the EDD
data while retaining a Melitz-Pareto core. We do this because Melitz-Pareto has become an
important benchmark model in international trade. It is consistent with many firm-level facts
(Eaton et al., 2011), generates a gravity equation (Chaney, 2008), and yields a simple summary
statistic for the welfare gains from trade (Arkolakis, Costinot and Rodrı́guez-Clare, 2012). We
want to make sure our empirical finding cannot be made compatible with Melitz-Pareto before
exploring an alternative productivity distribution.
First, we consider the possibility that fixed trade costs vary by origin-destination pair. Higher
fixed trade costs raise average exports per exporter, but lower total exports. For average exports
to be increasing in total exports, therefore, one needs variable trade costs to be very negatively
correlated with fixed trade costs. A corollary is that, whereas variable trade costs rise decisively
with distance between trade partners, fixed trade costs would need to fall with distance. We find
this rather implausible. More importantly, this model would imply that the intensive margin
elasticity should be equally important among the smallest and largest exporting firms; in the
data, the intensive margin elasticity rises steadily with exporting firm size when we put exporting
firms into size percentiles.
Second, we explore the role of multi-product firms. If the typical firm exports a higher number of products to destinations with larger overall exports, this could account for the importance
of the intensive margin for exports. We find that the number of HS 6-digit products per exporting firm does indeed account for about 12 percent of the variation in overall exports, or about
3
This property of the Melitz-Pareto model extends to environments with demand and fixed costs that are idiosyncratic to firm-destinations (Eaton et al., 2011); convex marketing costs (Arkolakis, 2010); non-CES preferences (Arkolakis, Costinot, Donaldson and Rodrı́guez-Clare, 2015); non-monopolistic competition (Bernard, Eaton, Jensen and
Kortum, 2003), and multinational production (Arkolakis, Ramondo, Rodrı́guez-Clare and Yeaple, 2014).

one-fourth of the intensive margin elasticity we estimate. In the context of the multi-product
Melitz-Pareto model developed by Bernard, Redding and Schott (2011), however, this explanation still requires firm-level fixed costs to fall with the distance between trading partners. And
the intensive margin elasticity per firm-product requires that fixed costs of exporting per product
also fall with distance.
A third hypothesis we investigate is granularity. With a finite number of firms, the intensive
margin (and overall exports) can be high because of favorable productivity draws from the Pareto
distribution within a country. We develop an estimator for the elasticity of fixed trade costs to
distance that is valid under granularity as in Eaton, Kortum and Sotelo (2012a), and continue to
find that fixed trade costs must fall with distance to explain a positive intensive margin elasticity.
Using simulations of finite draws from a Pareto distribution, we find that granularity generates
only a modest intensive margin elasticity, and — in contrast to the data — almost entirely in the
right tail of the exporter size distribution.
After these attempts to rescue the Melitz-Pareto special case, we entertain a lognormal distribution of firm productivity. Head, Mayer and Thoenig (2014) analyze how the welfare gains from
trade in the Melitz model differ with a lognormal instead of a Pareto distribution. Bas, Mayer and
Thoenig (2015) show how the trade elasticity varies with a lognormal distribution. Both papers
marshal evidence from firms in France and China pointing to the empirical relevance of the
lognormal distribution.
We consider a Melitz model with demand and fixed trade cost shocks that are specific to each
firm-destination, as in Eaton et al. (2011), but with a firm productivity distribution that is lognormal rather than Pareto. In particular, we assume that each firm is characterized by a productivity
parameter as well as an idiosyncratic demand shifter and fixed cost for each destination market,
all drawn from a multivariate lognormal distribution. We allow for a non-zero covariance between the demand shifter and the fixed cost in each destination, but set all other covariances to
zero. One appealing feature of this setup is that it is amenable to likelihood estimation methods.
As the likelihood is potentially not concave as a function of the parameters, and since we have a
large number of parameters to estimate (means, variances, covariance, and trade costs), we rely
on the estimation methodology proposed by Chernozhukov and Hong (2003).
Our estimation shows that a lognormal distribution for firm productivity can indeed generate a sizable intensive margin elasticity. When variable trade costs fall and fixed costs are constant, the productivity cutoff falls and the ratio of mean to minimum exports per firm increases
under the lognormal distribution (while being constant under Pareto).4 Shifting to lognormal
4

The result holds under other thin-tailed productivity distributions, such as bounded Pareto as in Feenstra (2014).

4

productivity also changes our inference about fixed trade costs, so that now they are rising with
distance. As in the data, the intensive margin elasticity rises steadily with the size percentile of
exporters under a lognormal productivity distribution.
We finish by studying the implications of our empirical findings for the quantitative impact
of changes in trade costs. We show how to extend the “exact hat algebra” used in Dekle, Eaton
and Kortum (2008) to a Melitz model with a general distribution of firm-level productivity, fixed
export costs and destination-specific demand shifters. We then compute the effects of counterfactual changes in trade costs on trade flows and welfare in our estimated full Melitz-lognormal
model. We compare these effects to those that obtain in the standard Melitz-Pareto model with
the Pareto shape parameter estimated to fit the average trade elasticity implied by our estimated
Melitz-lognormal model. The welfare effects in this Melitz-Pareto approximation are very close
to those in the Melitz-lognormal model, although there are significant differences regarding the
effects on trade flows.5
Our findings for the intensive margin and the importance of assuming a particular productivity distribution have implications beyond those from these counterfactual exercises. The Melitz
model has no frictions to reallocating inputs across firms, and takes firm productivities as exogenous. In the presence of reallocation frictions, whether the adjustment takes place along
the intensive or extensive margin could alter how trade liberalization impacts trade flows and
welfare. The distribution of firm productivity, meanwhile, affects technology diffusion through
trade in studies such as Buera and Oberfield (2015) and Perla, Tonetti and Waugh (2015), which
assume fat-tailed productivity distributions such as Pareto. In Perla et al. (2015), the gains from
trade are larger when trade liberalization raises average firm size relative to cutoff firm size —
which is closely tied to the intensive margin elasticity.
Our counterfactual analysis is related to Head et al. (2014) and Melitz and Redding (2015).
Using lognormal and bounded Pareto distributions, respectively, they show that the trade elasticity is not constant across countries or time. They then draw implications for the welfare effects
of trade in calibrated symmetric two-country models. Our conclusion — that the Melitz-Pareto
model offers a good approximation to the welfare effects if the data generating process is our
estimated full Melitz-lognormal model — is consistent with the finding in Head et al. (2014)
that their “macro-data approach” to calibration leads to similar results across the lognormal
A bounded Pareto distribution loses the analytical convenience of the unbounded Pareto while lacking the estimation
convenience of the lognormal distribution.
5
Our approach and findings bear some resemblance to those in contemporaneous work by Head and Mayer
(2018). They consider a model with rich patterns of substitutability across varieties and variable markups as the
true data generating process and explore the extent to which counterfactual implications are different if one wrongly
estimates and applies a simple CES-monopolistic competition model on the generated data. They find that the CES
model serves as a very good approximation.

and Pareto models. In contrast, Melitz and Redding (2015) show that the formula proposed in
Arkolakis et al. (2012) to compute welfare changes given changes in trade shares (their formula
for “ex-post welfare evaluation”) is no longer accurate if the Pareto productivity distribution is
bounded from above. We find Melitz-Pareto a good approximation because variation in the trade
elasticity is much smaller in our full Melitz-lognormal model estimated on the EDD data than
in their symmetric Melitz model with a truncated Pareto distribution calibrated to match the
relative size of exporting and non-exporting U.S. firms.
To recap, this paper makes several contributions to the literature. First, we use the EDD to
establish a new stylized fact, namely that between 40% and 60% of the variation in exports across
country pairs takes place along the intensive margin, with this margin being important all along
the firm-size distribution. Second, we show that the Melitz-Pareto model cannot match this
fact, even allowing for ad hoc fixed trade costs, multi-product firms and granularity. Third, we
show that a lognormal firm productivity distribution generates a positive role for the intensive
margin as required by the data. Fourth, we use likelihood methods and the EDD to estimate a
Melitz model with a lognormal distribution for productivity plus idiosyncratic demand shocks
and fixed costs. Finally, we extend the exact hat algebra approach to a generalized Melitz model
and use it with the estimated Melitz-lognormal model to explore counterfactual trade flow and
welfare implications relative to those of the Melitz-Pareto model.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the EDD data and document
the importance of the extensive and intensive margins in accounting for cross-country variation
in exports. Section 3 contrasts the predictions of the Melitz-Pareto model (with a continuum of
single product firms, multi-product firms or a finite number of firms) to the EDD facts. Section
4 shows how the implications of the Melitz model change when we drop the Pareto assumption
and instead assume that the firm productivity distribution is lognormal. Section 5 describes
the quantitative impact of trade cost shocks estimated based on “exact hat algebra.” Section 6
concludes.

The Intensive Margin in the Data

The Exporter Dynamics Database
We use the Exporter Dynamics Database (EDD) described in Fernandes et al. (2016) to study
the intensive and extensive margins of trade. The EDD is based on firm-level customs data covering the universe of export transactions provided by customs agencies from 59 countries (53
developing and 6 developed countries). For each country, the raw firm-level customs data con-

tains annual export flows (in current values) disaggregated by firm, destination and Harmonized
System (HS) 6-digit product. Oil exports are excluded from the customs data due to lack of accurate firm-level data for many of the oil-exporting countries. For most countries total non-oil
exports in the EDD are close to total non-oil exports reported in COMTRADE/WITS. More than
100 statistics from the EDD are publicly available at the origin-year, origin-product-year, origindestination-year, or origin-product-destination-year levels. These include average exports per
firm as well as the number of exporting firms.
For the descriptive analysis in this section as well as for the regression and simulation work in
the sections that follow we focus on a core sample that consists of 50 countries (49 from the EDD
and China) for which we have the firm-level data.6 However, to use the most comprehensive
sample of countries available we rely for the motivating plots below on an extended sample that
includes the 59 origin countries from the EDD plus China. Both samples cover a subset of years
from 2003 and 2013 — see Table 1 and Table I1 in the Online Appendix.
We focus on EDD statistics based on products belonging only to the manufacturing sector.
Specifically, relying on a concordance across the ISIC rev. 3 classification and the HS 6-digit
classification, we consider only exports of HS 6-digit products that correspond to ISIC manufacturing sub-sectors 15-37. Using these data we calculate variants of average exports per firm,
number of exporting firms, and total exports at the origin-destination-year level or at the originproduct-destination-year level. The product disaggregations that we use are HS 2-digit for the
extended sample and HS 2-digit, HS 4-digit, or HS 6-digit for the core sample.

Importance of the intensive margin
Let Xij , Nij and xij ≡ Xij /Nij denote total exports, total number of exporting firms, and average
exports per firm from country i to country j, respectively.7 In Figure 1 we plot the intensive
margin (ln xij ) and extensive margin (ln Nij ) vs. total exports (ln Xij ) for the extended sample of
countries. We restrict the sample to the origin-destination pairs with more than 100 exporting
firms (i.e., ij pairs for which Nij > 100) to reduce noise associated with country pairs with few
exporting firms.8 All variables plotted are demeaned of origin-year and destination-year fixed
effects. Each dot corresponds to (ln xij , ln Xij ) (Panel A) or (ln Nij , ln Xij ) (Panel B). The lines can
be ignored for now.
6

China is not included in the EDD due to confidentiality concerns.
There is also variation in our data over time, so in principle we should add a time subscript as well, as in Xijt . For
simplicity, we suppress the time subscript.
8
The core sample includes 1,305 unique country pairs with Nij > 100 while the extended sample includes 2,087
unique country pairs with Nij > 100. The total number of unique country-pairs is 8,401 in the core and 10,663 in the
extended sample.

A key statistic that we use to summarize the pattern observed in Figure 1 is the intensive
margin elasticity (IME), which is the slope of the (not shown) regression line in Panel A. In a
given year, the IME can be obtained from an OLS regression of ln xij on ln Xij with origin and
destination fixed effects:
ln xij = F Eio + F Ejd + α ln Xij + εij .

The IME is the estimated regression coefficient

cov(ln x̃ij , ln X̃ij )

var ln X̃ij

(2)

where we write ln z̃ij to denote variable ln zij demeaned by origin-year and destination-year
fixed effects. The complement of the IME is the extensive margin elasticity, defined as EME ≡
cov(ln Ñij ,ln X̃ij )
.
var(ln X̃ij )

The EME corresponds to the slope of the (not shown) regression line in Panel B

of Figure 1 and satisfies EME = 1 − IME.
Figure 1 demonstrates that both the IME and the EME are positive and large. As shown in
Panel A of Table 2, depending on the type of fixed effects included, the IME ranges from 0.4 to
0.46 in the core sample that we will use for the analysis in the next two sections. Our preferred
estimate of the IME is 0.4 based on the inclusion of origin-year and destination-year fixed effects (as in Figure 1).9 In this estimate, the intensive margin accounts for approximately 40% of
the variation in total exports across country pairs, while 60% is accounted for by the extensive
margin. As the focus has so far been on accounting for the variation in bilateral trade flows while
controlling for origin-year and destination-year fixed effects, it is natural to wonder how much
of that variation is absorbed by the fixed effects alone. The results in Table 2 show that this is
never more than 59 percent, implying that a large share of the variation in bilateral trade flows
comes from the forces behind the estimated IME.10

Robustness
The finding of a positive and large IME is robust to considering different samples. In Panel B
of Table 2 we estimate the IME including all country pairs — even those with less than 100 exporting firms. The IME in this case reaches 0.58 when origin-year and destination-year fixed
effects are included. In the Online Appendix Table I2 we reproduce the regressions in Table 2

To be specific, the equation estimated in this case is ln xijt = F Eit
+ F Ejt
+ α ln Xijt + εijt using all years of
available data for the country pairs included in the core sample.
10
This percentage comes from the R-squared of an OLS regression of bilateral total exports in logs (ln Xijt ) on
origin-year and destination-year fixed effects.

8

but now for the extended sample of countries. In the preferred specification with origin-year
and destination-year fixed effects, the IME is 0.38 among origin-destination pairs with at least
100 exporting firms and 0.52 among all origin-destination pairs.11 To make sure the IME is not
driven by small exporting firms, we re-estimate it after excluding firms whose annual exports fell
below $1,000 in any year. The corresponding IME estimates in Table 3 (core sample) and Online
Appendix Table I4 (extended sample) change only slightly.
A separate concern is measurement error. Since total exports is the sum of firm-level exports,
classical measurement error in exports per exporter x would bias the IME upward, but classical
measurement error in the number of exporters N would bias the IME downward. Depending
on their relative importance compared to the true IME, classical measurement error could bias
the IME upward or downward. If the measurement error is serially uncorrelated, then instrumenting total exports with its leads and/or lags should yield an unbiased estimate of the IME. As
shown in Online Appendix Table I5, the instrumented IMEs are very close to the OLS IME, both
economically and statistically.
Our results for the IME could be coming from country differences in industry composition
of exports combined with industry differences in average exports per firm. In Figure 2 we plot
the (demeaned) intensive and extensive margins against total exports at the origin-industrydestination-year level using HS 2-digit industries. The pattern here is similar to that in Figure
1. Table 4 shows that the IME actually increases when moving to industry-level data. At the
lowest level of aggregation available (HS 6-digit), for the core sample of countries the IME is
0.51 with origin-year-industry and destination-year-industry fixed effects. The results also hold
in the extended sample, for which we calculated IME disaggregated at HS2 product level. As
reported in the Online Appendix Table I6, this IME is also close to 0.52.12

IME by percentiles
A positive IME could be due to the presence of export superstars that increase both average
exports per firm and total exports for some country pairs, as discussed in Freund and Pierola
(2015). We study this possibility by considering separate IME regressions for each exporter size
percentile. For each origin-destination-year combination we distribute the exporting firms into
percentiles based on the value of their exports. Denoting average exports per firm in percentile
11

When we allow the IME to differ across origin countries depending on their GDP per capita, we find that IME
estimates are close to or larger than 0.4 for any group of countries, as shown in Online Appendix Table I3.
12
The presence of large trading firms could lead to both high exports per firm and high total exports and explain
our IME estimates. While we are unable to identify large trading firms in the EDD data, we estimate the IME based
on a sample including only HS 2-digit industries with low shares of firms exporting via intermediaries, as defined in
Chan (2017). The results in Online Appendix Table I7 show an almost unchanged IME at 0.53.

ln Xij + ij .
ij = F E i + F E j + α

We define the IME for each percentile as IMEpct ≡ α̂pct .
We plot the IMEpct for each percentile (with confidence intervals) in Figure 3 along with the
horizontal line at the overall IME of 0.4.13 The IME is 0.5 for the highest percentile. But the positive overall IME is not coming exclusively from the export superstars: the IMEpct rises steadily
from 0.2 at the 50th percentile to 0.3 at the 80th percentile.

IME for multi-product firms
We can dig deeper and study whether average exports per firm can be explained by the number
of products exported per firm or by exports per product per firm. Let mij be the average number
of products exported from i to j by firms exporting from i to j, and let xpij ≡ xij /mij be the
average exports per product per firm exporting from i to j. We define the IME at the product
level as IMEp ≡ cov(ln x̃pij , ln X̃ij )/var(ln X̃ij ). Since xij = xpij mij , the IME is equal to the IMEp
plus the extensive product margin elasticity,
IME = IMEp +

cov(ln m̃ij , ln X̃ij )
.
var(ln X̃ij )

Table 5 reports the results for the IMEp for the core sample.14 Most of the IME is explained by the
systematic variation in average exports per product per firm, rather than in the average number
of products exported by firm.

Taking stock: the IME in the EDD
Summarizing the results so far, we find the intensive margin elasticity to be positive and significant, both statistically and economically. This finding is robust to the inclusion of a variety
of fixed effects, various samples, exclusion of small firms, and disaggregation by industry. The
IME is positive and monotonically increasing across the whole distribution of exporter size. The
systematic cross-country-pair variation of average exports per firm comes primarily from the
behavior of average exports per product per firm.

14

For exporter percentiles to be well-defined we focus on country pairs for which Nij > 100.
Bernard et al. (2009) present a similar decomposition for U.S. exports. We compare their results to ours below.

Correlation between intensive and extensive margin, and relation with distance
We now move beyond the intensive margin elasticities and report additional stylized facts on the
correlations between the intensive margin, the extensive margin, and distance. There is a positive and significant correlation between average exports per firm and the number of exporting
firms (0.25, standard error 0.01) after taking out origin-year and destination-year effects. Table 6
shows how these margins vary with log distance with alternative sets of fixed effects. The elasticities are all negative and significant when controlling for origin-year and destination-year fixed
effects: average exports per firm, the number of firms, average number of products exported per
firm, and average exports per product per firm all decline with distance between trade partners.

Relation to previous empirical results
We finish this section by relating our stylized facts to those of EKK, EKS, Bernard et al. (2007) and
Bernard et al. (2009). EKK use firm-level export data for a single origin (France) and show that
average exports per firm increase with market size of the destination (measured as manufacturing absorption) with an elasticity of 1/3. In Figure 4 we plot market size (horizontal axis) against
our estimated destination fixed effects (vertical axis) from a regression of average exports per
firm on origin, destination and year fixed effects based on the core sample and country pairs for
which Nij > 100. A regression line (not shown) through the points in the plot implies that average exports per firm increase with destination market size with an elasticity of 0.19, a bit lower
than the result in EKK.15
EKK also show that firms exporting to more destinations exhibit higher sales in the domestic
(French) market. Our data does not include domestic sales, but we can instead look at sales in
the most popular destination market for each origin. Let xil|j denote average exports to destination l computed across firms from i that sell in markets l and j and let l∗ (i) ≡ arg maxk Nik
be the most popular destination market for each origin country i (e.g., the United States (U.S.)
for Mexico). In Figure 5 we plot log x

remains valid for our data with many origin countries: firms that sell in more markets are more
productive as proxied by their sales in their origin country’s most popular destination market.
15

Similar findings are obtained in unreported plots where the destination fixed effects are based on the extended
sample and all country pairs or based on the core sample and either country pairs for which Nij > 100 or all country
pairs.
16
The EKK estimating sample includes only firms with sales in France. To implement an approach comparable to
theirs, we drop all firms from country i that do not sell to l∗ (i), so the sample includes only Nil∗ (i) firms for country i.
This implies that all firms that make up Nij are also selling to l∗ (i).

EKS find that average exports per firm are very similar across four origin countries (Brazil,
Denmark, France and Uruguay) for which they have customs data. They regress average exports
per firm on origin and destination fixed effects and find that the origin fixed effects differ little across their four origins. Running the same regression in our dataset (but pooling across
years and including year fixed effects), we find that origin fixed effects do vary significantly
across countries (the coefficient of variation in the estimated origin fixed effects ranges from
0.81 to 2.56, depending on the sample used) and are higher for countries with higher GDP per
capita and higher total exports.17 Moreover, origin-year and destination-year fixed effects are
not enough to capture the variation in ln xij : a regression of ln xij on origin-year and destinationyear fixed effects yields an R-squared of 0.65 when only country pairs with Nij > 100 are considered and only 0.37 when all country pairs are considered.
Using firm-level export data for the U.S., Bernard et al. (2009) present a similar decomposition to the one we present above for multi-product firms, except that they cannot allow for
destination fixed effects because their data is for a single origin. They find that IMEp is around
0.23, which is not far from our finding of around 0.29. On the other hand, contrary to our results,
Bernard et al. (2007) find that average exports per product per firm increase with distance. We
believe that the difference arises from the fact that, by having data for multiple origins, we are
able to control for destination fixed effects. In fact, Table 6 shows that regressing ln xpij on ln distij
with only origin and year fixed effects but without destination fixed effects yields a positive and
significant coefficient as in Bernard et al. (2007), whereas the coefficient becomes negative and
significant when destination fixed effects are added. The same happens when regressing ln xij
on ln distij .

The Intensive Margin in the Melitz-Pareto Model

In this section we ask how the Melitz model with Pareto distributed firm productivity stacks up
relative to the findings of the previous section. We focus on the implications of this model for
the intensive margin elasticity. We start with the simplest model, which entails a continuum of
single-product firms with a Pareto distribution for productivity as in Chaney (2008) and Arkolakis et al. (2008). We derive a series of properties of this model, and then explore their robustness to allowing for destination-specific demand and fixed trade cost shocks at the firm level as
in EKK, for multi-product firms, and for granularity.

17

For this purpose, we run regressions of the estimated origin fixed effects on population, GDP, GDP per capita,
and total exports, jointly and separately.

The Basic Melitz-Pareto Model

Theory
As this is a well-known model, we will be brief in the presentation of the main assumptions.
There are many countries indexed by i, j. Labor is the only factor of production available in
fixed supply Li in country i and the wage is wi . Preferences are constant elasticity of substitution (CES) with elasticity of substitution across varieties σ > 1. Each firm produces one variety
under monopolistic competition. In each country i there is a large pool of firms of measure Ni
with productivity ϕ distributed Pareto with shape parameter θ > σ − 1 and scale parameter bi ,
Pr (ϕ ≤ ϕ0 ) = Gi (ϕ0 ) = 1 − (ϕ0 /bi )−θ . Firms from country i also incur fixed trade costs Fij as
well as iceberg trade costs τij to sell in country j.18

These are the two key equations that we use to derive the results in the rest of

this section.
Combining the definition of the intensive margin elasticity given in the previous section (i.e.,
IME =

cov(ln x̃ij ,ln X̃ij )
)
var(ln X̃ij )

with equations (9) and (10), the model implies that

(11)

This result can be used to extract several implications of the model, which we present in the
form of four observations in the rest of this section.
Our first observation says that if all variation in fixed trade costs comes from origin and destination fixed effects with no country-pair component, for example because Fij ∝ wiγ wj1−γ (as in
Arkolakis (2010)), then the model implies that the intensive margin elasticity is zero.


Observation 1: If var ln Feij = 0 then IME = 0.
Since this is a key result, it is worth understanding it in more detail. Using Equation (3) together with the definition of xij , taking logs and differentiating w.r.t. ln τij we get

The first term is the direct effect on incumbent firms, while the second term captures selecd ln(1−Gi (ϕ∗ij ))
tion. In turn, selection is the product of −

xij (ϕ∗ )
1 − xijij , which captures how much less firms export at the cutoff relative to the average.

14

Obviously, if xij = xij (ϕ∗ij ) then there is no selection, while the effect of selection is maximized
d ln(1−Gi (ϕ∗ij ))
if xij (ϕ∗ij )/xij = 0. With a Pareto distribution for productivity we have −

Combined with the assumption that θ̄ > 1, the result in equation (11) also implies that if
the intensive margin elasticity is positive then there must be a negative correlation between the
variable and fixed trade costs (ignoring origin and destination fixed costs).
Observation 2: If IME > 0 then corr(ln Feij , ln τeij ) < 0.
Ignoring origin and destination fixed effects, equation (10) implies that
g ij ) = cov(ln x
g ij ).
cov(ln Feij , ln dist

Thus, if average exports per firm fall with distance then fixed trade costs must also fall with
distance. This is captured formally by our third observation which is related to the fixed trade
costs elasticity with respect to distance.

Combining equations (9) and (10) to solve for ln Feij and ln τeij in terms of ln xij and ln Nij yields
ln Feij = δiF,o + δjF,d + ln xij

θ ln τeij = δiτ,o + δjτ,d − θ̄ ln xij − ln Nij .

(13)

and

Model-implied values for ln Feij are (ignoring origin and destination fixed effects) directly given
by ln xij , but for ln τeij a value for θ̄ is required to go from ln xij and ln Nij in the data to modelimplied values for θ ln τ̃ij .

This implies that the intensive margin elasticity calculated separately for each exporter size percentile is the same as the overall intensive margin elasticity.
Observation 4: IMEpct = IME, for all pct.

THE INTENSIVE MARGIN IN TRADE

Data
We now use Observations 1 – 4 above to relate the simple Melitz-Pareto model to the data as
described in Section 2.
Observation 1 indicates that if fixed trade costs vary by origin and destination but not across
country pairs, i.e., var(Feij ) = 0, then the IME should be equal to zero while the EME should be
equal to one. This is captured in Figures 1 and 2 by the horizontal line for the model-implied
intensive margin (panel a) and the line with unit slope for the model-implied extensive margin
(panel b). These implications of the model stand in sharp contrast to what is seen in the data,
both in Figures 1 and 2 and in Tables 2, 3, and 4, which reveal an IME of 0.4 or higher.
For the simple Melitz-Pareto model to be consistent with the data, we need to move away
from var(Feij ) = 0. As per Observation 2, however, the positive IME seen in the data implies a
negative correlation between model-implied fixed and variable trade costs. Moreover, Observation 3 combined with the result in Table 6 of a negative distance elasticity of average exports per
firm implies that model-implied fixed trade costs fall with distance.
We explore these results further by using equations (12) and (13) to compute model-implied
fixed and variable trade costs.19 The correlation between the resulting fixed and variable trade
costs is −0.786 (with a standard error of 0.007). Figure 6 plots these trade costs against distance. The Figure shows that model-implied fixed trade costs are decreasing with distance, while
model-implied variable trade costs are increasing with distance.20 The distance elasticities corresponding to Figure 6 are reported in Table 7. For fixed trade costs this elasticity is −0.28 (as
per Observation 3, this is equal to the distance elasticity of average exports reported in Table 6)
while for variable trade costs the distance elasticity is 0.272, both statistically significant.
Finally, according to Observation 4, the simple Melitz-Pareto model implies that IMEpct =
IME for all pct. This theoretical prediction of a common elasticity across percentiles is captured
by the horizontal line red in Figure 3. This is at odds with the data.
To conclude, the simple version of the Melitz-Pareto model with fixed trade costs varying
only because of origin and destination fixed effects is clearly at odds with the data. One can of
course allow a richer pattern of variation in fixed trade costs across country pairs to make the
model perfectly consistent with the data, but then the positive IME has further puzzling implications for fixed trade costs, which should fall with distance and be very negatively correlated with
variable trade costs. To the best of our knowledge, there are no models that would microfound
19
To compute model-implied variable trade costs as in equation (13), values for θ and θ̄ are required. We set θ = 5
from Head and Mayer (2014) and σ = 5 from Bas et al. (2015), which jointly imply θ̄ = 1.25.
20
Variable trade costs must increase with distance so that total exports fall with distance, as implied by the results
in Table 6.

16

FERNANDES-KLENOW-MELESHCHUK-PIEROLA-RODRı́GUEZ-CLARE

such a strong and negative correlation between the two types of trade costs and a negative fixed
trade costs elasticity with respect to distance.21 The data is also at odds with the implication
from the Melitz-Pareto model of a constant IME across exporter size percentiles.

3.2.

Multi-Product Extension of Melitz-Pareto

In this section we explore whether the puzzling implications for trade costs arising from the
Melitz-Pareto model can be avoided by extending the model to multi-product firms. The idea
would be that average exports per firm may fall along with total exports (thereby creating a positive IME) as firms facing higher product-level fixed trade costs export fewer products (even
though they export more per product). Roughly speaking, allowing for multi-product firms implies that part of the extensive margin in the basic Melitz-Pareto model now operates inside the
firm and appears as an intensive margin. We will see, however, that under the Pareto assumption
the effect of higher product-level fixed trade costs on the number of products exported per firm
is exactly offset by higher average exports per product, so that Observation 1 in the basic model
will remain valid in this extension.

Theory
We consider an extension of the Melitz-Pareto model due to Bernard, Redding and Schott (2011).
Each firm can produce a differentiated variety of each of a continuum of products in the interval
[0,1] with productivity ϕλ, where ϕ is common across products and λ is product-specific. The
firm component ϕ is drawn from a Pareto distribution Gf (ϕ) with shape parameter θf , while the
firm-product component λ is drawn from a Pareto distribution Gp (λ) with shape parameter θp .
To have well-defined terms given a continuum of firms, we impose θf > θp > σ − 1. To sell any
products in market j, firms from country i have to pay a fixed cost Fij , and to sell each individual
product requires an additional fixed cost of fij . Variable trade costs are still τij .
The cutoff λ for a firm from country i with productivity ϕ that wants to export to market j,
λ∗ij (ϕ), is given implicitly by
Aj

(14)

Allowing for tariffs in addition to iceberg trade costs would naturally lead to a positive correlation between modelimplied variable and fixed trade costs. This is because a tariff affects trade flows both by increasing the price of the
affected good, as with iceberg trade costs, and by decreasing the net profits conditional on the quantity sold, as
with fixed trade costs. See the online appendix of Costinot and Rodrı́guez-Clare (2014), Felbermayr et al. (2015), and
Caliendo et al. (2015).

It is easy to verify that if fij = 0 for all i, j then this model collapses to the canonical model with
single-product firms.
Recalling our definition of the intensive margin elasticity at the firm and product level introduced in Section 2 and letting θ̄ ≡ θf / (σ − 1) and χ ≡ θf /θp , then from equations (16) to (18) we
have
IME = −

Observation 1 in the single-product firm model remains valid in the multi-product firm model,
while we now have an analogous observation for the product-level intensive margin elasticity:

Observation 5: If var ln feij = 0 then IMEp = 0.
The assumption θf > θp > σ − 1 implies that χ > 1 and θ̄ > χ > 1 and in turn this leads to
the following extensions of observation 2:
Observation 6: If IME > 0 then either cov(ln feij , ln Feij ) < 0 or cov(ln Feij , ln τeij ) < 0 (or both).
Observation 7: If IMEp > 0 then either cov(ln feij , ln Feij ) < 0 or cov(ln feij , ln τeij ) < 0 (or both).
Observation 3 remains valid in the multi-product firm model, and we now also have an analogous observation for product-level fixed trade costs:

As in the single-product case, we can use the model to back out the implied trade costs.
Equation (18) can be used to obtain a model-implied Feij (which would be the same as the one
derived in the single-product model) while Equation (17) can be used to obtain a model-implied
feij , and Equation (16) can then be used to obtain a model-implied τeij .
Data
Since Observations 1 and 3 remain valid when the basic model is extended to allow for multiproduct firms, the conclusions regarding the necessity of having fixed trade costs decrease with
distance remain valid. Turning to the implications for product-level fixed trade costs, the finding
in Section 2 of a positive IME at the product level, IMEp > 0 in Table 5, combined with Observation 5 implies that, to be consistent with the data, the multi-product version of the Melitz-Pareto


model presented above requires var ln feij > 0. However, observations 6 and 7 imply that the
two types of fixed trade costs would need to be negatively correlated, or that the covariances
between those fixed trade costs and variable trade costs would have to be negative. Moreover,
Observation 8 combined with the results in Table 6 implies that model-implied product-level
fixed trade costs decrease with distance with an elasticity of −0.071, as shown in the third column of Table 7 and illustrated in Figure 7. We conclude that the puzzling implications of the
Melitz-Pareto model remain valid when the model is extended to allow for multi-product firms.

3.3.

Firm-Level Demand and Fixed-Cost Shocks

EKK extend the basic Melitz-Pareto model presented in Section 3.1 to allow for (log-normally
distributed) firm-level destination-specific demand and fixed-cost shocks. Except for constants
that capture the net effects of these shocks, our equations (7) and (8) remain valid in the EKK
environment, and hence so do observations 1-3.22
It is important to note, however, that if productivity is distributed Pareto then the presence
of log-normally distributed demand or fixed-cost shocks would imply that equations (7) and (8)
no longer hold. The critical assumption in EKK that allows their model to be consistent with our
equations (7) and (8) is that, loosely speaking, they consider the limit as the scale parameter of
the Pareto distribution converges to zero.23
22

This can be confirmed by simple manipulation of equations (20) and (28) in EKK.
More exactly, EKK specify a function for the measure of firms with productivity above some level, with that measure going to infinity as productivity goes to zero. This is equivalent to taking a limit with the (exogenous) measure
of firms going to infinity and the scale parameter of the Pareto distribution going to zero. Although equations (7) and
(8) do not hold anywhere in this sequence, they do hold in the limit.
23

THE INTENSIVE MARGIN IN TRADE

To formally establish this result, recall that to get equations (7) and (8) we assumed that ϕ∗ij >

bi . If instead ϕ∗ij ≤ bi then Nij = Ni and xij = θ−(σ−1)
. In the extreme, if ϕ∗ij ≤ bi
bi
holds for all i, j pairs, then we would have IME = 1 rather than IME = 0. Now think about
the case with firm-specific demand and fixed-cost shocks. Specifically, assume that each firm is
characterized by a productivity level ϕ as well as a demand shock αj and a fixed cost shock fj in
each destination j, with ϕ drawn from a Pareto distribution (with scale parameter bi and shape
parameter θ) and αj and fj drawn iid from some distribution. Let xij (ϕ, αj ) ≡ Aj αj (σ̄

wi τij (1−σ)
ϕ )

and let ϕ∗ij (αj , fj ) be implicitly defined by xij (ϕ∗ij , αj ) = σfj . By the same argument we used in
Section 3.1, if for all i, j and all possible (αj , fj ) we have ϕ∗ij (αj , fj ) > bi , we can easily show that
we still have IME = 0.24 However, if αj and fj are lognormally distributed, then for bi > 0 for all i
there must be a positive mass of firms for which ϕ∗ij (αj , fj ) < bi , and for those firms there would
be a positive intensive margin elasticity. EKK essentially avoid this by taking the limit with bi → 0
for all i.
In principle, one could use this result to argue that a Melitz model with Pareto distributed
productivity but extended to allow for log-normally distributed demand and fixed-cost shocks
could match the positive IME that we see in the data. However, such a model would not exhibit
any of the convenient features of the canonical Melitz-Pareto model: the sales distribution is
not distributed Pareto, the trade elasticity is not common across country pairs and fixed, and
the gains from trade are not given by the ACR formula. Given that, our approach in this paper
is to move all the way to a model where productivity as well as destination-specific demand and
fixed-cost shocks are lognormally distributed. Such a model has at least the advantage that it
is computationally tractable, and amenable to likelihood estimation methods, as we show in
Section 4.

3.4.

Granularity

The previous sections have considered a model with a continuum of firms. With a discrete and
finite number of firms it may be possible to generate a positive covariance between the intensive
margin and total exports that could in principle explain our empirical findings. To state this
formally, we rely on the extension of the Melitz-Pareto model to allow for granularity in Eaton et
24
Consider the group of firms from country i that have some given draw {(αj , fj ), j = 1, ..., n}. The exact same
argument used in Section 3.1 can be used to show that the sample of firms obtained by combining such firms across
all origins i satisfies IME = 0. One can then simply integrate across all possible draws {(αj , fj ), j = 1, ..., n} to show
that IME = 0 for the whole set of firms.



this could explain IME > 0 even with cov ln Feij , ln τeij > 0. Thus, in theory, granularity could
explain the positive intensive margin elasticity that we find in the data without relying on implausible patterns for fixed trade costs.
To check whether granularity is a plausible explanation for the positive IME in the data we
conduct two tests, whose details are show in the Online Appendix B. First, we estimate the elasticities of model-implied firm-level and product-level fixed trade costs with respect to distance
taking into account granularity. The results shown in Table 8 imply that although the distance
elasticities are significantly lower than those estimated ignoring granularity in Table 7, they
remain negative, implying that model-implied fixed trade costs are decreasing with distance.
Hence granularity does not help to eliminate one of the puzzles emerging from the comparison
between the Melitz-Pareto model and the data.
Second, to assess how well granularity can explain a positive IME, we simulate exports of Nij
firms for each of the country pairs in the sample. To study the IME generated by granularity by
 
itself, we assume that there is no country-pair variation in fixed-trade costs, var Feij = 0. In
addition to the standard Melitz model, where firm sales are perfectly correlated across destination markets, we also allow for a case in which all heterogeneity comes from destination specific
demand shocks, so that sales are independent across destinations. Finally, we simulate productivities for 3 values of θ̄: an estimate of θ using the procedure in Eaton et al. (2011), as outlined
in the Online Appendix, A, which yields θ̄ = 2.4; the value that can be inferred from standard estimates of θ and σ in the literature (i.e., θ = 5, the central estimate of the trade elasticity in Head

θ̄ = 1 (as in Zipf’s Law).
Table 9 reports the results of this simulation exercise. Two broad patterns emerge from the
table. First, the simulated IME decreases with θ̄. This is because the effect of granularity on the
IME is stronger when there is more dispersion in productivity levels. Second, the simulated IME
is highest when productivity is less correlated across destinations, again because this gives granularity more room to generate a covariance between average exports per firm and total exports.
For our estimate of θ̄ (θ̄ = 2.4) and with no demand shocks (so there is perfect correlation in
firm-level productivity across destinations), the simulated IME of 0.001 is quite low. The highest simulated IME occurs for the case in which θ̄ = 1 and there is no correlation between the
product of demand shocks and productivity across destinations. In this case the simulated IME
is 0.33, not too far from our preferred estimate based on the data of 0.4. But we think of this as
an extreme case because θ̄ = 1 is far from the estimates that come out of trade data, and because of the implausible assumption that firm-level exports are completely uncorrelated across
destinations. A low θ̄ also implies that, in contrast to the data, virtually all of the action behind a
positive IME comes from the superstar firms. To see that, we calculate average simulated exports
per firm in each percentile and use those to estimate an IME per percentile. We plot the resulting
100 IME estimates in Figure 8 along with the corresponding IME estimates based on the actual
data. The IME based on the actual data is increasing with a spike at the top percentile. Granularity and the Pareto distribution fail to reproduce this pattern in the simulated data, since the
corresponding IME is much smaller than in the data for most percentiles. The IME in the simulated data is almost zero for small percentiles and is relatively high for a small number of top
percentiles. We conclude that granularity does not offer a plausible explanation for the positive
estimated IME in the data.

The Intensive Margin in the Melitz-Lognormal Model

In this section we depart from the assumption of a common Pareto distribution of firm-level productivity and instead assume a lognormal distribution.25 In the theory section we start by showing how this can lead to a positive IME in a simple Melitz model, and then propose a maximum25

One could consider combining a lognormal distribution with a Pareto distribution on the right tail, as in Nigai
(2017). We have used Nigai’s Matblab code on our data to estimate the point of truncation (percentile) where the
lognormal ends and the Pareto begins. We find that for 75% of country pairs with more than a hundred exporters the
point of truncation occurs after the 99th percentile, and for the median country pair the truncation point is at the
99.9%. In light of these results, in the rest of the paper we focus on the case in which productivity is described by a
fully lognormal distribution.

likelihood estimation procedure for a richer Melitz model with heterogeneous fixed costs and
demand shocks. The data section presents the results from the estimation and the implications
for the IME as well as for the model-implied trade costs.
We also develop a flexible methodology to calculate counterfactual changes in trade flows in
response to a change in trade costs. We improve Dekle et al. (2008) “exact hat algebra” approach
that can accommodate any distribution of productivity, demand, and fixed cost shocks. Using
this approach we emphasize important differences in counterfactual trade flows responses in
the Melitz-Pareto and lognormal models.

4.1.

Theory

Melitz model with a lognormal distribution
Consider a model as that presented in Section 2 but with general CDF and PDF Gi (ϕ) and gi (ϕ).
The ratio of average to minimum exports per firm for each country pair can be written as
ϕ̃i (ϕ∗ij )
ϕ∗ij

If firm productivity is distributed Pareto with parameter θ > σ − 1 (as in Section 2) then

ϕ̃(ϕ∗ij )
ϕ∗ij

=

for all ϕ∗ij , (see equation 8), so that the average to minimum ratio does not depend on

selection. This property only holds with a Pareto distribution of productivity.
As argued in footnote 15 of Melitz (2003),

ϕ̃(ϕ∗ij )
ϕ∗ij

is decreasing in the productivity cutoff if the

distribution gi (ϕ) “belongs to one of several common families of distributions: lognormal, exponential, gamma, Weibul, or truncations on (0, +∞) of the normal, logistic, extreme value, or
Laplace distributions. (A sufficient condition is that gi (ϕ)ϕ/(1 − Gi (ϕ)) be increasing to infinity
on (0, +∞).)” To understand the implication of this property, consider a decline in τij , so that ϕ∗ij
decreases with no effect on minimum sales (which remain at σFij ). The decline in τij leads to
an increase in exports of incumbent firms (which increases average exports per firm) and entry
of low productivity firms (which decreases average exports per firm). Under Pareto these two effects exactly offset each other so there is no change in average exports per firm. If productivity is
distributed in such a way that

ϕ̃(ϕ∗ij )
ϕ∗ij

is decreasing then the second effect does not fully offset the

23

first, and hence average exports per firm increase with a decline in τij . Since this also increases
the number of firms that export (and hence total exports), the result is a positive IME.
We now explore the magnitude of the implied IME in the case where gi (ϕ) is lognormal for
every origin country i. Assuming that gi (ϕ) is lognormal with location parameter µϕ,i and scale
parameter σϕ , and letting Φ(·) be the CDF of the standard normal distribution, then

Gi (ϕ) = Φ

Letting h(x) ≡ Φ0 (x)/Φ(x) be the ratio of the PDF to the CDF of the standard normal, Bas et al.

Thus, the average to minimum ratio of exports per firm for country pair ij only depends on the
share of total firms in i that export to j, with the relationship given by the function Ω(·). As argued
by BMT, Ω(·) is an increasing function, which is consistent with the observation by Melitz (2003)
above that

ϕ̃(ϕ∗ij )
ϕ∗ij

is decreasing in ϕ∗ij since Nij /Ni is decreasing in ϕ∗ij .

Given values of σ̄ϕ as well as Ni for every country, we can use our data on Nij to compute
Ω (Nij /Ni ) for all country pairs. Combined with xij (ϕ∗ij ) = σFij and imposing Fij = Fio Fjd , we
can use equation (27) to get the model-implied average exports per firm (in logs),

ln xij = µx,o
i + µj + ln Ω (Nij /Ni ) .

(28)

In contrast to Observation 1 for the Melitz-Pareto model, under under lognormality we will have
a positive IME even with var(F̃ij ) = 0.
We can also compute model-implied fixed and variable trade costs similarly to what we did
under the assumption of Pareto-distributed productivity. First, we obtain F̃ij from
ln Feij = δiF,o + δjF,d + ln xij − ln Ω

defined fixed effects)

Armed with estimates of Feij and (σ − 1)e
τij , we can compute their correlation and check whether
Feij increases or decreases with distance (demeaned by origin and destination fixed effects).
These empirical exercises require estimates for σ̄ϕ as well as Ni for every country. We use
Bento and Restuccia (2015) (henceforth BR) data to estimate a value for Ni for all the countries
in our sample.26 We acknowledge slippage between theory and data in that we obviously do not
have a measure of the entry level Ni , but (at best) only for the number of existing firms, which
in theory would correspond to (1 − Gi (ϕ∗ii )) Ni (our approach in the next subsection avoids this
problem). We use the QQ-estimation proposed by Head et al. (2014) (henceforth HMT) to obtain
estimates of σϕ and µϕ,i for every i (see Online Appendix C for a detailed description).

Full Melitz-lognormal model
The previous section has shown that a model with a lognormal distribution of firm productivity
is capable of generating a positive intensive margin elasticity conditional on fixed costs. However, the model we considered had two very stark predictions. First, fixed trade costs that are
common across firms lead to the prediction that sales of the least productive exporter from i to
j are equal to σFij . In the data we observe many firms with very small export sales (sometimes
as low as $1) which implies unrealistic fixed trade costs. Second, as shown by Eaton et al. (2011),
the model implies a perfect hierarchy of destination markets (i.e., destinations can be ranked
according to profitability, with all firms that sell to a destination also selling to more profitable
destinations) and perfect correlation of sales across firms that sell to multiple markets from one
origin. None of these predictions holds in the data.
In this section we consider a richer model with firm-specific fixed trade costs and demand
shocks that vary by destination. This is similar to the setup in Eaton et al. (2011). We assume
that firm productivity, demand shocks (denoted by αj ) and fixed trade costs (denoted by fj ) are
26

Using census data as well as numerous surveys and registry data, BR compiled a dataset with the number of
manufacturing firms for a set of countries. Unfortunately, the sample in BR has missing observations for a number
of countries in the EDD. We impute missing values projecting the log number of firms on log population. There is
a tight positive relationship between log number of firms in the BR dataset and log population with an elasticity of
0.945, as reported in Table 10 and in Figure 9.

Note that we allow mean log productivity to be origin-specific while imposing that the mean
of demand shocks be the same across origin-destination pairs (however, we cannot separately
identify these parameters). Mean fixed costs are allowed to vary across origin-destination pairs
and can be correlated with demand shocks within destinations. In our empirical estimation we
will not be able to separately identify mean productivity from wages and variable trade costs –
they will all be absorbed into an origin-destination fixed effect. Also, we allow the dispersion
of log productivity, log demand shocks and log fixed trade costs to differ across all origins. We
restrict the dispersion of log demand shocks and log fixed trade costs to be the same across
destinations within a given origin.
Without risk of confusion, we change notation in this section and use Xi ≡ (Xi1 , ..., XiJ ) to
denote the random variable representing log sales of a firm from i in each of the J destinations,
with xi ≡ (xi1 , ..., xiJ ) being a realization of Xi , and gXi (xi ) being the associated probability
density function. According to the model, a firm does not export to destination j if it has a large
fixed trade cost draw fj relative to its productivity and its demand shock for that destination. Let

Using firm-level data from the EDD and China across different origins and destinations, we
can estimate the parameters in (32) as well as mean log fixed trade costs (up to a constant) and
their dispersion using maximum likelihood methods. The Online Appendix D shows how to
derive the density function gXi1 ,..,XiJ (x1i , ..., xiJ ) for the case when we observe sales to J destinations. We simplify the analysis by considering only data for fifteen destinations (USA, Germany,
Japan, France and the 11 largest destinations by exports value for each origin), which we label
j = 1, ..., 15 for the year 2007 for each of 39 origins. We compute gXi1 ,...,XiJ (x1i , ..., xiJ ) for each
observation in our dataset (which is a realization of {Xi1 , ..., XiJ } that we observe). Since all random variables are independent across firms, we can compute the log-likelihood function as a
sum of log-densities,

As the likelihood is potentially not concave in θi and

because there are 34 parameters per origin to estimate, we rely on the estimation methodology
proposed by Chernozhukov and Hong (2003).27 We use the Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algo(n)

rithm to construct a chain of estimates Θi
27

for each origin country. Chernozhukov and Hong

Roughly speaking, this methodology uses the likelihood function as a probability distribution of the set of parameters to be estimated, and then via simulation finds the expectation of this distribution. This expectation is used
as the estimator for the parameters. Note that this is not maximum likelihood estimation, since we are not selecting
the point where the density is maximized. A detailed description of the estimation procedure can be found in the
Online Appendix E.

explore whether the different parameters in θi converged to the same values across different
chains and discuss the convergence of the chains in the Online Appendix F.
Loosely speaking, identification works as follows. First, data on export flows and the number
of exporters across country pairs helps in identifying dij and µ̄f,ij . Second, the variance of firm
sales within each ij pair helps in identifying the sum of the dispersion parameters for productivity and demand shocks, σ̄ϕ,i + σα,i . Third, the extent of correlation of firm sales from a particular
origin across different destinations helps in identifying σϕ,i separately from σα,i : the more correlated firm sales are across destinations, the larger is σϕ,i relative to σα,i . Fourth, the correlation
between fixed costs and demand shocks can be inferred from the distribution of sales of small
firms. Intuitively, if correlation is negative, then a firm with a bad demand shock would also
likely draw a high fixed cost shock and thus will not export, hence, we would not see a lot of
small firms in the data. Finally, to understand how σf,i is identified, imagine for simplicity that
there is only one destination. We then have
gXi1 (xi1 ) =

gZi1 (xi1 ) × Pr {ln σ + ln fi1 ≤ xi1 |Zi1 = xi1 }
Ci

where Ci ≡ Pr{ln σ + ln fi1 ≤ Zi1 } and gZi1 () is the probability density function of the latent sales
Zi1 . This implies that we can get the density of Xi1 by applying weights

Pr{ln σ+ln fi1 ≤xi1 |Zi1 =xi1 }
Ci

to the density of Zi1 . The parameter σf,i regulates how these weights behave with xi1 . In the
extreme case in which σf,i = 0 then the weights are 0 for xi1 ≤ µfi1 and 1/C for xi1 > µfi1 , while
in the other extreme with σf,i = ∞ the weights are all equal to 1. For intermediate cases the
density of Xi1 will be somewhere in the middle, with the left tail becoming fatter and the right
tail becoming thinner as σf,i increases. This suggests that we can identify σf,i from the shape of
the density of sales.
We will use the results of the estimation to conduct exercises similar to those in the previous
sections. First, we will compute the IME for all firms and for each percentile using the estimated
model. Second, after removing origin and destination fixed effects, we will compute the correlation across the estimated values of dij and µ̄f,ij , and between them and distance.

4.2.

Data

28

FERNANDES-KLENOW-MELESHCHUK-PIEROLA-RODRı́GUEZ-CLARE

Simple Melitz model with lognormal distribution
Online Appendix Table I9 reports the QQ-estimate of σ̄ϕ . We report three sets of estimates: for
the full sample, the largest 50% of firms and the largest 25% of firms for each origin-destination
pair in each year. These estimates are on the high side relative to the estimate obtained by HMT,
so we will use the minimum among them, σ̄ϕ = 4.02, which corresponds to the subsample with
the largest 25% of firms.28 We highlight three findings. First, a lognormal distribution allows the
intensive margin elasticity to be positive even under the assumption of a continuum of firms.
Second, for our estimate of the shape parameter (σ̄ϕ = 4.02), the implied IME is 0.28, which is
close to that from the data.29 Third, most of the action comes from the right tail of the exporter
size distribution, as seen in Figure 10.
We use equations (29) and (30) to compute the model-implied fixed and variable trade costs.
The correlations between those costs and distance are reported in Table 11 and plotted in Figure 11. In contrast to our results under Pareto, now under lognormal both the model-implied
variable and fixed trade costs are increasing with distance.
Overall, the model does much better in fitting the data when we assume that firm productivity is distributed lognormal than when we assume that it is distributed Pareto. However, the
IME for each percentile is not a perfect match to the data, and there is still a negative correlation
between the model implied variable and fixed trade costs, although it is much closer to zero than
with Pareto (-0.3 rather than -0.8). In any case, this is just a ”proof of concept” that lognormallydistributed productivity can by itself improve the performance of the model relative to the data.
In the next subsection we present the results obtained with the estimated full Melitz-lognormal
model.
Full Melitz-lognormal model
To estimate the parameters of the full Melitz-lognormal model we use firm-level data from the
EDD and China for the year 2007.30 This entails 39 different origins, but we had to drop 2 origins
from our analysis due to convergence issues discussed in the Online Appendix F. As mentioned
above, we consider 15 destinations: USA, Germany, France, Japan, and the 11 largest destinations by export value for each origin. Finally, we use the estimates of Bas et al. (2015) and set
σ = 5.
Before presenting the results of the estimation and discussing their implications for the IME,
28
See the section in the Appendix titled QQ-Estimation of σ̄ϕ for a discussion of these estimates and their relation
to the estimate in HMT.
29
Using Head et al. (2014) estimate of σ̄ϕ = 2.4 we get IME of around 0.12.
30
For computational reasons, for China we considered only a random sample consisting of 5% of exporters.

THE INTENSIVE MARGIN IN TRADE

we show three figures revealing the fit of the estimated model with the data. Figure 12 shows a
plot of the density function for standardized firm-level log sales pooled across multiple origin
and destinations.31 We see that the model generates a distribution that closely fits the one in the
data.
We next look at deviations from the strict hierarchy of firms sales across destinations (for
each origin) in the data and in the estimated model. If there were no demand and fixed cost
shocks across firms, then all firms from a given origin that export to less popular destinations
would also export to the most popular destination. The share of firms that only sell in the less
popular destinations is then a measure of the extent to which this strict hierarchy predicted by
the simplest model is violated. According to Figure 13, the share predicted by the estimated
model is quite close to the one in the data.
Finally, Figure 14 shows, for each origin and any two destinations among the three most popular ones, the correlation in export value across all firms that sell in those two destinations. The
estimated model mostly implies positive correlation driven by firm-level productivity shocks,
while in the data this correlation exhibits more dispersion.
We now turn to our estimates of the variance-covariance parameters (σ̄ϕ,i , σα,i , σf,i , ρi ). These
are shown in Table 12. The median estimated values for σ̄ϕ,i and σα,i across 37 origins are 3.18
and 2.67 respectively, while the median estimates for σf,i and ρi are 2.39 and 0.50. Even though
the variance-covariance parameters were precisely estimated for each of the origins, the parameters vary quite a bit across different origins.32 In general, there is a positive correlation between
demand and fixed costs shocks, but some origins exhibit a negative correlation.
Table 13 and Figure 15 show the implications of the estimated model for the IME. We compute the IME implied by the estimated model by drawing one million firms for each origin (this
implies one million latent log sales and log fixed costs for each destination), computing average sales (taking into account selection), and then multiplying average sales by Nij in the data
to compute total exports.33 The IME implied by the model is 0.63. This is actually higher than
our preferred IME estimate of 0.4 in Section 2, but the gap comes in large part from the different sample of origin-destination pairs used here. Using the same sample of 37 origins and 4
destinations for the year 2007 we estimate IME of 0.67 (with a standard error of 0.03) that is statistically indistinguishable from the one implied by our estimated lognormal model.34 We plot
31

Standardized firm-level log sales are obtained by, for each origin-destination cell, subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.
32
The estimates and confidence bands for each of the parameters are reported in the Online Appendix F.
33
We pick one million because at this point we are not interested in granularity – this is just a numerical approximation to the case with a continuum of firms.
34
The confidence interval in Table (13) comes 1000 random realizations of the parameters in our Markov chains.

the associated IME for each percentile in Figure 15 – the pattern of the IME across percentiles is
remarkably close to what we see in the data.
Table 14 shows the elasticity of variable and fixed trade costs with respect to distance (controlling for origin and destination fixed effects). Now both types of trade costs are strongly increasing in distance. Surprisingly, however, we still get a negative correlation between fixed and
variable trade costs.
Overall, our estimated full lognormal-Melitz model does a very good job in fitting the EDD
data and in solving the puzzles associated with the Pareto model. The lognormal model generates an IME that is close to the one we see in the EDD and implies fixed trade costs that decrease
with distance. The implied pattern for the IME across different percentiles is also very similar to
what we see in the data.

Counterfactual Analysis

In this section we study whether the counterfactual implications of the Melitz-lognormal model
estimated as in the previous section differ from those of the Melitz-Pareto model estimated as
described below. To conduct counterfactual analysis, we need to close the model. We do so
in standard fashion by assuming that labor is the only factor of production, with wage wi and
perfectly inelastic labor supply Li in country i, by assuming that entry costs are in terms of labor,
and that fixed exporting costs are in terms of labor of the exporting country. To make the model
be perfectly consistent with the data, we allow for trade imbalances via exogenous international
P
transfers, as in Dekle et al. (2008). Formally, letting Xi = l Xli denote total sales by country i
P
and Yi = j Xij denote total expenditure, trade imbalances are equal to international transfers
∆i – that is, ∆i = Xi − Yi .

Exact Hat Algebra in the Generalized Melitz Model

Here we show how to extend the “exact hat algebra” for counterfactual analysis in Dekle et al.
(2008) to the Melitz model with a general productivity distribution (not necessarily lognormal)
and allowing for firm-level demand and fixed-cost shocks.
We start by introducing some notation. Let µϕ,i , µα and µf,ij denote the mean of ln ϕi , ln α,
and ln fij , respectively, and let f˜ij ≡ ln fij − µf,ij , ϕ̃ij ≡ (σ − 1)(ln ϕi − µϕ,i ) + ln α − µα and
Aij ≡ ln

+ (σ − 1)µϕ,i + µα − µf,ij .

Using this notation, firms from i export to j if and only if f˜ij ≤ Aij + ϕ̃ij . The fraction of
country i firms that export to country j is then

where gij is the joint pdf of f˜ij and ϕ̃ij . The previous equation implicitly defines a function

Counterfactual Analysis in the Estimated Full-Lognormal Melitz Model

For our counterfactual analysis we need a set of countries for which we have λij , hij , Xj and Yi , as
well as gij for all i and j in that set. Since we assume (see Section 4) that the variances of ϕi and fij
differ by origin but not by destination, then gij = gi for all i and j. We have estimated gi for a set
of 37 EDD countries, and we can infer the implied Ni for all those countries, so we can include
any subset of those countries in our analysis.35 We then construct hij using data for Nij and
hij ≡ Hij (Nij /Ni ). Finally, we also need Xij and Nij for i = j. Following the approach proposed
by Ossa (2012), we construct Xii as manufacturing value-added in country i from the World
Development Indicators divided by 0.25, which is close to the average share of manufacturing
value-added in gross production from the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) for the set of
covered EDD countries in 2007. We set Nii = Ni , which would be true if there are no fixed costs
for domestic sales.
We conduct our counterfactual analysis for a world composed of the 12 Latin American
countries and China, for which we have estimated the full lognormal model.36 We do not consider the whole EDD dataset for computational reasons. This is because some of the country
pairs in the whole EDD dataset trade very little and this makes our welfare calculations imprecise (since we need to use numerical approximation to compute some of the integrals).
We are interested in comparing the counterfactual implications of the full Melitz-lognormal
model with those of the Melitz-Pareto model. We proceed in three steps. First, we allow for some
change in trade costs and compute the counterfactual implications using the estimated full
Melitz-lognormal model. We consider four different trade costs shocks: a 1%, a 5%, a 10%, and a
25% uniform reduction in international trade costs – formally, τ̂ij = τ̂ ∈ {0.99, 0.95, 0.9, 0.75} if i 6=
j, while τ̂ii = 1. Second, we use these results to estimate the trade elasticity by running the OLS
regression
ln X̂ij = γio + γjd − θ ln τ̂ij + ζij .

(49)

This leads to four values of the trade elasticity, one for each τ̂ . Following ACR, we use these
values as estimates of the shape parameter of the Pareto distribution in the Melitz-Pareto model,
which we denote by θτ̂ for τ̂ ∈ {0.99, 0.95, 0.9, 0.75}.37 Finally, for each trade cost shock τ̂ we
35

To see how we get Ni , note that the estimated model provides us with a probability that a random firm from some
origin is selling to at least one of the 15 destinations we consider. Since we observe the total number of exporters to
those destinations, we can infer the total number of firms from which they are drawn. The more detailed procedure
is described in the Online Appendix D.
36
Our procedure implicitly assigns trade flows between these countries and countries outside of this group to domestic transactions.
37
We get θ0.99 = 4.5; θ0.95 = 4.49; θ0.9 = 4.47; θ0.75 = 4.43.

34

FERNANDES-KLENOW-MELESHCHUK-PIEROLA-RODRı́GUEZ-CLARE

compute the counterfactual implications in the Melitz-Pareto model using both θ0.99 (a local
approximation) and θτ̂ (an average trade elasticity computed for the actual trade cost shock).
We expect θ0.99 to differ from θτ̂ because in the true model (i.e., the full Melitz-lognormal model)
the trade elasticty is not a constant, as emphasized by Melitz and Redding (2015).
We show the results of this exercise in Figures 16 and 17. We use Ŵim ≡ ŵim /P̂im and X̂ijm to
denote the hat changes in welfare and trade flows for the lognormal model (m = LN ) and the
Pareto model (m = P ). Figure 16 plots ŴiLN − 1 (horizontal axis) versus ŴiP − 1 (vertical axis) in
response to the four different trade costs shocks, in each case reporting ŴiP − 1 computed with
both θ0.99 and θτ̂ . It is evident that both models yield very similar results even when we only use
the local approximation θ0.99 for the trade elasticity in the Melitz-Pareto model. As is well known
from Arkolakis et al. (2012) and Melitz and Redding (2015), the welfare effects of trade liberalization depend critically on the behavior of the trade elasticity, which is qualitatively different
across the two models: while the trade elasticity in the Melitz-Pareto model is common across
country pairs and invariant to shocks, this is no longer true in the Melitz-lognormal. However,
it turns out that the (average) trade elasticity (as implied by the regression in 49) does not vary
much in the estimated Melitz-lognormal model as we move from one equilibrium to the other,
as can be seen by noting that θ̂0.99 = 4.5 while θ̂0.75 = 4.43. We explore this further by using our
estimated gi and nij to compute the local trade elasticity for each country pair using the formula
derived by Bas et al. (2015) for the Melitz-lognormal model. The resulting elasticity ranges from
4 to 6.9 with a standard deviation of 0.59, with the higher values occurring for country pairs with
a low nij , as shown in the Online Appendix G. However, this variation in trade elasticities across
country pairs matters little for the gains from a uniform decline in trade costs, because the larger
gains obtained with partners for which the trade elasticity is higher is compensated by the lower
gains with partners for which the trade elasticity is lower. Loosely speaking, for a uniform trade
cost shock, what matters is the average trade elasticity, and so the Pareto model yields a good
approximation for the gains from uniform trade liberalization, and this holds even when using
the local trade elasticity θ0.99 .
Even though gains from trade liberalization are very close across the two models, the Pareto
and the lognormal models differ in their implications for the counterfactual changes in bilateral
trade flows. Figure 17 plots the ratio of the difference between the counterfactual changes in
trade flows in the lognormal model, X̂ijLN , and in the Pareto model, X̂ijP , against the trade elasticity implied by the lognormal model. We can see that Melitz-Pareto model can significantly
over- or underpredict changes in trade flows depending on the actual trade elasticity. Naturally,
the higher trade elasticity in the lognormal model leads to larger changes in trade flows relative

THE INTENSIVE MARGIN IN TRADE

35

to the Melitz-Pareto model.
What happens if trade liberalization is asymmetric? We consider an extreme case in which,
for each origin, trade costs decrease only for exports to the destination with the highest number
of exporters – formally, we consider 13 separate shocks, one for each Latin American country
and China as an origin, with the shock for origin i being that τ̂ij = 0.25 if j = arg maxl Nil and
τ̂ij = 1 otherwise. Since the trade elasticity should be low for the affected pairs, we expect the
Melitz-lognormal model to deliver smaller welfare gains than the Melitz-Pareto model. This is
confirmed in Figure 18. However, the differences in welfare gains between the two models are
small. Again, as in the analysis with symmetric trade cost declines, we see bigger differences
regarding the effects on trade flows, as shown on Figure 19.
It is interesting to compare our results to those in Melitz and Redding (2015). They find that
the ACR ex-post formula for welfare evaluation does a poor job of capturing the true welfare
changes from a decline in trade costs in a symmetric Melitz model with a truncated Pareto distribution. In contrast, we find that the ACR formula does a good job in approximating welfare
changes in the estimated Melitz-lognormal model. The difference comes from how much the
trade elasticity varies in the two models: whereas it falls from 15 to 5 as trade costs decline in
the Melitz-Redding exercise, the trade elasticity shows little variation in our Melitz-lognormal
model. In particular, three quarters of bilateral trade elasticities lie between 4 and 4.8. Note
that after trade liberalization, elasticities can never fall below 4, and thus the local trade elasticities are a good approximation to the average trade elasticities during the liberalization episodes.
We discuss this further in Appendix H, in which we show that we can reproduce the Melitz and
Redding (2015) results but only by setting parameters to values far from those we estimate.

Conclusion

The canonical Melitz model of trade with Pareto-distributed firm productivities has a stark prediction: conditional on the fixed costs of exporting, all variation in exports across partners should
be due to the number of exporting firms (the extensive margin). There should be no variation
along the intensive margin (exports per exporting firm), again conditional on fixed costs.
We use the World Bank’s Exporter Dynamics Database plus China to test this prediction.
Compared to existing studies, this data allows us to look for systematic variation in the intensive and extensive margins of trade — allowing for year, origin, and destination components of
fixed trading costs.
We find that at least 40% of the variation in exports occurs along the intensive margin. That is,

36

FERNANDES-KLENOW-MELESHCHUK-PIEROLA-RODRı́GUEZ-CLARE

when exports from a given origin to a given destination are high, exports per firm are responsible
for, on average, at least 40% of the high exports. This finding is robust to looking at all destinations or only the largest destinations, including all firms or ignoring very small firms, including
all country pairs or only ones for which more than 100 firms export, and to disaggregating across
industries. When we look at average exports by percentile of exporting firms (rather than average
exports per firm), we find the intensive margin is more important the higher the percentile.
Although variation in fixed trade costs across country pairs can make the Melitz-Pareto model
fit the intensive margin in the data, such fixed trade costs would need to be negatively correlated with distance. Moreover, variation in fixed trade costs does not reproduce the pattern of
a steadily rising intensive margin across exporter percentiles. Allowing firms to export multiple
products or taking into account granularity does not reverse these implications.
In contrast, moving away from a Pareto distribution and assuming that the productivity distribution is lognormal resolves the puzzles. Specifically, we estimate a Melitz model with lognormally distributed firm productivity and idiosyncratic firm-destination demand shifters and
fixed costs. We estimate this model using likelihood methods on the EDD firm-level data. Our
estimated Melitz-lognormal model is consistent with the positive intensive margin overall and
with the intensive margin rising by exporting firm percentile. This specification also implies
fixed trade costs that increase with distance.
Since the trade elasticity is no longer a constant in the full Melitz-lognormal model, one
would expect from the analysis in Arkolakis et al. (2012) that the welfare effects of a trade cost
reduction would be different from those in the Melitz-Pareto model (see Melitz and Redding,
2015). However, extending exact the hat algebra approach popularized by Dekle et al. (2008)
to our estimated full Melitz-lognormal model, we find that the Melitz-Pareto model provides a
remarkably good approximation for the welfare effects of trade liberalization.
Looking ahead, moving from Pareto to lognormal firm productivity may matter more when
taking into account how domestic firms can learn from firms selling or producing in the domestic market. In Alvarez et al. (2014), Buera and Oberfield (2015), and Perla et al. (2015), trade liberalization boosts the level or growth rate of technology through such learning spillovers. The size
of this dynamic gain should depend on whether the distribution of firm productivity is Pareto vs.
lognormal, as it interacts with how trade alters the distribution of producer and seller productivity. For example, trade liberalization induces more entry of marginal exporters under Pareto
than under lognormal — as illustrated by the unchanging exports per exporter under Pareto
(zero intensive margin elasticity, unit extensive margin elasticity) versus the sizable intensive
margin and weaker extensive margin under lognormal.
