Competition and Intervention in Sovereign Debt Markets

ABSTRACT
We investigate markets for defaultable sovereign debt in which even though there are many
identical lenders and symmetric information (including no hidden actions), perfect competition does not
obtain. When a private lender allows a sovereign country to increase its level of indebtedness, that lender
implicitly imposes a default externality on others who have lent to that sovereign. That is, in the case
where the borrower would be able to pay back the first loan in the absence of a second loan, the borrower
may have a strong incentive to take both loans and default on both loans. When a lender has no control
over the actions of other lenders, they must anticipate this behavior and devise a lending strategy that is
consistent with the strategies not only of the sovereign borrower, but also of other lenders. We develop
a model of this strategic lending behavior in the presence of default, and show that even though there are
many competing lenders, the perfectly competitive outcome does not necessarily obtain. Moreover, the
equilibrium can result in monopoly-like outcomes in prices and quantities. We also study the
consequences of intervention in these markets by a seemingly benevolent international financial
institution, and find that these interventions, though well-intentioned, can in some cases be welfare
reducing for sovereign countries and welfare improving for private lenders.

Introduction

Discussions about the behavior of international credit markets, and markets
for sovereign debt in particular, are often predicated on one of two very
different assumptions about the structure of the markets. If we assume that
markets for sovereign debt are competitive and, if left to their own devices,
borrowers and lenders would organize their activities in an efficient manner
(as they presumably do in many other markets), any intervention by an
institution like the IMF is distortionary and necessarily welfare reducing. On
the other hand, if lenders are assumed to be unable to closely monitor the
behavior of sovereign borrowers and are unable to enforce international debt
contracts, these markets are subject to severe moral hazard problems which
can lead to severe market failures. In this case the IMF’s role is to enhance
private loan markets to reduce fears of market failure and improve the welfare
of both borrowers and lenders. Clearly then, the proper role of intervention
by an institution like the IMF is strongly influenced by assumptions about
the structure of the market for defaultable sovereign debt.
There is a large literature dealing with a variety of aspects of sovereign
debt markets (see, for example, Eaton and Fernandez (1995), Eichengreen
(1991), Eaton and Gersovitz (1981), Bulow and Rogoff (1989), and Gibson
and Sundareson (2001), among many others). The foundation for virtually
all of this work, however, is competitive equilibria (with or without frictions).
In this paper, we adopt a different perspective on these markets. We maintain
the assumptions that there are many competing lenders and there is symmetric information — assumptions that are typically associated with first-best
competitive outcomes. However, we show that the competitive outcome need
not obtain. The ability of a sovereign to retain some of their income in the
case of default induces a “default externality” that lenders must account for
when offering defaultable bond contracts to a sovereign borrower. In other
words, lenders must behave strategically even though they have no competitive or informational advantage.
Our model is one of strategic interactions between lenders and the sovereign
borrower, rather than more abstract bond-market participants. Hence, it is
more likely to apply in situations in which a country doesn’t have access to
liquid international bond markets, but rather must rely on loans from international banks. This is common for small countries. For example, throughout
1

the 1980’s and 1990’s, Ghana issued no long-term bonds to private creditors,
but borrowed significant amounts from commercial banks and other private
lenders. On the other hand, of the $87.5 billion of Mexico’s long-term public debt outstanding in 1999, only $9.7 billion came from commercial banks
and private lenders. Our model may also apply when a sovereign’s likelihood of default is very high, hence, it is excluded from further borrowing
in international bond markets, e.g., Argentina in 2001. Overall, banks play
a significant role in sovereign debt markets. Banks held 97 percent of all
emerging markets debt at the end of the 1980s. This number fell to roughly
two-thirds by the mid-1990s as the volume of debt grew enormously (see
Eichengreen and Mody (1998) and Bernstein and Penicook (1998)), however, it is still the dominant form of credit when one excludes the largest
of emerging-market economies e.g., Mexico and Brazil (see Chanda et al
(2001)). Moreover, two necessary assumptions of our model, first that loan
contracts are non-exclusive, and second, that sovereign borrowers can shelter
some of their income from creditors in the event of default, seem to apply in
many situations involving private institutions lending to sovereign countries.
Empirical work on sovereign loan markets suggest that standard competitive models of sovereign loan markets do not provide a sufficient explanation
for much of what we observe. Edwards (1984) shows that spreads on loans
to sovereign LDCs in the late 1970’s exhibit a lot of variation that cannot
be explained with standard economic factors. (Edwards (1986) demonstrates
that this applies for sovereign bonds as well as loans.) Others have found that
interest-rate spreads on sovereign debt seem puzzling from the perspective
of standard competitive models. Eichengreen and Mody (1998) have documented that in the early 1990s, much of the variability in interest rate spreads
on emerging market debt is accounted for by a country-specific fixed effect,
and that the explanatory power of economic fundamentals is much less than
standard theory would suggest. In addition, a recent IMF report (Chadha et
al. (2001)) finds that emerging-market interest-rates do not have a clear relationship with default episodes. They also find that emerging market debt
outperforms other comparably risky investments including corporate debt
and even the S&P500 index. Generally, therefore, it is difficult to explain
either the high level or the co-movements with standard economic fundamentals for interest rates observed in sovereign debt contracts. Understanding
these data, therefore, would seem to require a different approach.

2

Our analysis of sovereign debt markets applies recent work by Parlour
and Rajan (2000) on unsecured personal credit markets. We extend their
model to include random productivity shocks which allows default to be an
observable outcome, as it is in the international debt markets in which the
IMF involves itself. In addition, we introduce an IMF-like institution into
the analysis in a number of different ways. We are thereby able to obtain
both positive predictions about the role of IMF activity in the industrial organization of these debt markets, and also normative predictions about the
welfare consequences of the IMF. Both the Parlour and Rajan (2000) analysis
of unsecured personal credit and our analysis of sovereign debt are related to
earlier applications of asymmetric information and moral hazard to similar
problems. Pauly (1974) has explored equilibria in insurance markets when
existing contracts are unobservable, which is analogous to our non-exclusivity
requirement. Kletzer (1984) explores the existence of competitive Nash equilibria in sovereign debt markets in a multi-period model with non-observable
contracts, however, he does not analyze the non-competitive equilibria implied by the non-exclusive contracts in our model. Bizer and DeMarzo (1992)
show that a default externality can arise in a sequential borrowing problem
with moral hazard and seniority. They explore the consequences of this for
interest rates and indebtedness and compare these outcomes to a model with
full commitment.
We show that a range of symmetric, subgame-perfect-Nash equilibria are
supportable in the markets we model. Of particular interest is the case where
in spite of the large number of lenders with symmetric information, the equilibrium is equivalent (in terms of the equilibrium interest rate and aggregate
loan size), to that of a single monopoly lender. We show that the existence of
this equilibrium depends critically on the fraction of income/output that the
sovereign retains upon default. When this fraction is relatively high, lenders
responding strategically to the default externality will be able to extract
monopoly rents from borrowers. Counter-intuitively, lenders would be made
ex ante worse off (and conversely, borrowers made better off) if all of the
sovereign’s income was lost in the case of default. In other words, removing
the default externality would induce competition to the market and eliminate
the monopoly rents. We extend these basic results to contracts with statecontingent interest rates and find that comparable symmetric equilibria with
monopoly-like behavior can be sustained. We also derived conditions under
which these equilibria still exist when debt contracts can be renegotiated ex
3

post.
Output volatility plays a key role in our model, both in providing an
environment conducive to non-competitive outcomes, and also in weakening
the link between the terms of loan contracts and competitive fundamentals
like default probabilities. As output becomes more volatile, monopoly-like
equilibria become more likely, and interest rates can be much larger than
would be justified by default probabilities alone.
From this new perspective, the potential roles for intervention by an institution like the IMF that have been traditionally advocated, have very different consequences than in both standard competitive models and marketfailure models. We introduce an IMF-like institution into this setting and
explore the consequences of different assumptions about its incentives. We
show that if the IMF competes with private lenders for loans but, rather than
maximizing profits, they lend to maximize the utility of the sovereign, the
IMF becomes the “lender of first resort” and drives out all private lenders
from a non-competitive equilibrium. If, however, in a monopoly-like equilibrium, the institution can only lend a fraction of what private lenders would
provide, the country’s total borrowing and total borrowing costs are unaffected, and the institutions surplus is extracted by private lenders. On the
other hand, if the IMF-like institution operates as a provider of insurance
to sovereign borrowers and lends only in states where the sovereign defaults
(i.e., a “lender of last resort”), a country that is already facing monopoly-like
pricing will receive an increase in welfare. However, this insurance can have
different consequences for different countries. We show that this insurance
mechanism can push a country that would otherwise face competitive pricing
into a situation where positive-profit equilibria can be sustained.
Section 2 of the paper introduces the theoretical framework for the model.
Section 3 derives a variety of results on existence of equilibria and the competitive and welfare implications of various equilibria. Section 4 introduces a
benchmark model in which analytical results are much clearer, and Section 5
introduces an IMF-like institution into this benchmark model and studies the
positive and normative implications of different incentives for this institution.
Section 6 returns to the general specification and explores some numerical
examples of the model. In section 7, we show how the monopoly-like equilibria might be affected by changes in the economic environment by allowing
4

state-contingent debt contracts and renegotiation. Section 8 concludes the
paper.

The market for defaultable sovereign loans

In this section we describe the basic framework for our analysis of competition in sovereign loan markets. There are potentially many identical
lenders and one sovereign borrower. All information is symmetric and complete. In other words, there is no adverse selection or moral hazard in this
model. There are two time periods. In the initial period, the lenders and
the sovereign borrower agree upon a set of debt contracts such that the debt
market clears. In the second period, the stochastic output is realized, debts
are repaid (or not), and consumption takes place. All agents, both borrowers
and lenders, are risk neutral and have rational expectations. Therefore, they
each seek to maximize (at least initially) the expected value of second-period
consumption. The sovereign country, however, has the ability to abandon
its commitment to pay back its loans in the second period, and will do so
whenever its ex post consumption is larger in default than under the terms
of the loan contracts. Lenders can anticipate these strategic defaults and
will adjust contract offerings accordingly. This strategic behavior generates
complex interactions between borrowers and lenders, and the potential for
non-competitive market outcomes in what would appear to be an otherwise
simple and transparent setting.
Before exploring these possibilities in detail, we first specify the economic
environment. Lenders, denoted i = 1, 2, . . . , M , compete by offering a oneperiod debt contract to the sovereign country. Each contract specifies the
loan’s principal, di , and interest rate, ri . The sovereign uses these loans to
produce output using a production function given by
f (x, θ̃) = θ̃Axβ ,

(1)

where 0 < β < 1, A > 0, and θ̃ is a stochastic productivity shock. The
ex post value of the shock is public knowledge. For simplicity, we assume
that there are two possible realizations for this shock, {θL , θH }, such that
θH > θL ≥ 0. (We will often assume that θH = 1, and θL = 0, to simplify
the analysis even further.) The probability of the high state is denoted as p.
5

An important assumption of this model is the sovereign’s potential to
both default and maintain positive consumption while in default. To capture
this, we assume that in the case of default, the sovereign can shield a fraction
γ of output from their creditors, where 0 ≤ γ ≤ 1. That is, the most that a
sovereign can be punished for defaulting is a fraction (1 − γ) of second-period
output. Therefore, when γ = 1, the sovereign pays nothing back to lenders
and consumes all of their output, and when γ = 0, the sovereign consumes
nothing in the case of default. Given this assumption, the sovereign will
default on all of its creditors whenever ex post consumption in default is
greater than consumption under the terms of the contracts:
M
X

γf (

i=1

M
X

di , θ) −

i=1

M
X

(1 + ri )di ,

(2)

i=1

where we assume that the only input to production comes from sovereign
P
debt, and that M
i=1 (1 + ri )di is the principal and interest owed on all loans.
It is obvious from the expression in equation (2) that a lender acting in
anticipation of a potential default, must be concerned not only with that
lender’s own loans, but also the loans of all other lenders.
A second key assumption of this model is that a lender cannot force
the sovereign to commit to accepting only one loan contract and, similarly, a
lender cannot preclude others from lending to the same sovereign. Therefore,
each additional loan contract increases the likelihood of default on all loan
contracts. Each loan contract increases the likelihood of default. In other
words, if the total amount offered by all lenders is large enough, the sovereign
country can choose to accept all loans and default on all loans, independently
of the interest rates charged on these loans. Therefore, by offering a loan
contract, each lender creates a negative externality for every other lender,
since each loan increases the incentive of the sovereign to default on all loans.
As with most externality problems, there can be multiple equilibria in this
economy. We will restrict our attention to symmetric pure-strategy subgameperfect Nash equilibria in which every lender offers a positive amount and the
country accepts all debt contracts. Although these assumptions may rule out
some interesting behavior, this approach is relatively tractable analytically,
yet yields a sufficiently rich set of equilibria to generate interesting noncompetitive outcomes which we can use to frame both positive and normative
6

issues in sovereign debt markets. We make these equilibrium assumptions
more specific in the next section.

3

Loan market equilibria

A lender chooses a contract {di , ri } to maximize the expected value of profits:
q[(1 + ri )di ] + (1 − q)d¯ − di ,

(3)

where q is the probability that they will be repaid by the sovereign borrower,
d¯ is the amount that the lender receives in the case of default, and the riskfree interest rate is assumed to be zero. (This is without loss of generality,
since we could define ri to be the excess return on sovereign lending.) We
also assume for simplicity that the lenders receive nothing from the sovereign
in the case of default. Hence, d¯ = 0, will be maintained from now on. The
fraction (1 − γ) of output is simply a deadweight loss to the economy.
Given that there are two states of the world, lenders face two alternatives.
They can lend an amount such that the sovereign country decides to default
in the low state but pays back in the high state, or they can offer contracts
such that the sovereign is better off paying back in both states of the world.
Given the default externality described above, the probability of repayment,
q, depends on the lender’s own actions, di and ri , the set of contracts offered
by other lenders, {d−i , r−i } (in obvious notation), the stochastic production
process with parameters θ, p, A, and β, and also on the default-consumption
parameter, γ:
q(di , ri , {d−i , r−i }, θ, A, β, p, γ) ∈ {0, p, 1} ,

(4)

The probability of repayment will be equal to 1 if the sovereign country
repays the loans in both states of the world, it will equal p if the country
pays back only in the high state, and it will equal 0 if the country never
repays the loans. Note that if q is equal to 0 the lender’s expected profits are
maximized at 0, , i.e., the optimal contract is to set di equal to 0.
Given the set of contracts offered by all lenders, the sovereign country
decides which contracts to accept in the first period, and whether to repay
or default in the second period.
7

Definition: A symmetric subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium is a set of contracts, {d, r}, such that
1. for each lender i
{d, r} = arg max q(di , ri , {d, r}; θ, p, A, β, γ)(1 + ri )di − di ,
di ,ri

2. the country accepts all contracts offered, and
3. q ∈ {0, p, 1} is consistent with the sovereign country’s decision to default.
Finding an equilibrium, therefore, requires further characterization of the
repayment probability, q, which is contingent on the country’s default decision. The country will evaluate default contingency by contingency, and
form an expected value accordingly. For an arbitrary interest rate r and loan
d, the country’s expected utility equals:
n

o

p max f (d, θH ) − (1 + r)d, γf (d, θH )
n

o

+ (1 − p) max f (d, θL ) − (1 + r)d, γf (d, θL )

.

(5)

Note that when θL is greater than zero, the country might be willing to repay
even in the low state.
If the country does not default in either state of the world, debt contracts
are completely riskless. If, in addition, markets are competitive, then the
equilibrium interest rate must be equal to the risk-free rate, which is assumed
to be equal to zero. Expected utility, therefore, is given by
f (d, E[θ̃]) − d .
The country’s optimal loan size in this no-default case is denoted as dˆN D ,
and is the solution to
arg max f (d, E[θ̃]) − d .
d

The largest loan consistent with repayment in both states, denoted as d¯L , is
not necessarily equal to dˆN D . Rather, it is determined by the lowest state
alone (since if default is not optimal in the low state, it cannot be optimal
8

in the high state), and results in indifference between default and repayment
in that state:
γf (d¯L , θL ) = f (d¯L , θL ) − (1 + r)d¯L .

Definition: A riskless competitive debt contract is defined as {dC

Note that for γ high enough and a concave production function,2 the loan
amount that maximizes the country’s surplus, dˆN D , will be larger than the
amount that induces repayment in both states of the world, d¯L . For our
particular production function we get

Theorem 1 There are no riskless competitive equilibria when γ > γN D .
(The proof of this theorem is a straightforward extension of the proof of
Theorem 3, below.)
The intuition for this result is straightforward. If dˆN D is greater than
d , the marginal lender can always offer a contract with a lower principal
amount and a higher interest rate instead of the competitive contract. Since
accepting this new contract will increase the country’s utility, the competitive
contract cannot be sustained as an equilibrium.
¯L

Equilibria with default

For the competitive contract to make sense in this risky environment, we require that
L
β > θθH , which we assume throughout.

9

If the country chooses to default in the low state, but repays in the high
state, the debt contracts become risky. Since p is the probability of default
in this case, the marginal cost of funds to any lender is 1/p, which would also
be the interest rate in a competitive environment. The country’s expected
utility in this case is given by
pf (d, θH ) + (1 − p)γf (d, θL ) − d .

(6)

Analagous to the no-default case, we can define a contract size, d¯H , such that
the country is just indifferent to defaulting or repaying in the high state:

As before, for γ high enough the loan amount that maximizes the country’s surplus will be larger than the amount that induces repayment in the

and

Hence we have a second theorem that again rules out competitive equilibria
when γ is sufficiently high. We first find the value of γ for which dˆD = d¯H :
γD =

pθH
(1 − β) .
pθH + (1 − p)θL β

Theorem 2 There are no risky competitive equilibria when γ > γD .

10

The intuition behind this result is directly analagous to Theorem 1. The
main implication of these two theorems is that in a setting where γ is relatively large, we cannot rely on the predictions of competitive equilibria even
when the number of symmetric lenders is extremely large. There are many
non-competitive equilibria that one might consider at this point. We will focus our attention primarily on a monopoly equilibrium. That is, we explore
whether an equilibrium in this sovereign debt market with many lenders can
exhibit the same interest rate and loan size as a market dominated by a single
monopolist. To develop intuition for this result, we first simplify the stochastic process which, in turn, simplifies the analytical expressions that define
the equilibria without affecting the basic qualitative results of the model.

4

A benchmark case

In this section, we simplify the model by assuming θH = 1, θL = 0. This
guarantees that there is no equilibrium were the country does not default in
the low state, since they have no output in that case, f (d, θL = 0) = 0. We
also write f (d, θH = 1) as simply f (d).
Competitive equilibria
We will begin by defining the competitive contract for this case. Given
that investors are risk neutral and that the country will only be able to repay
in the high state, in a competitive market the interest rate will be equal to
1/p. If the country had the ability to choose how much debt to borrow at
the competitive market rate it would solve:

Monopoly equilibria
We can say more about the non-competitive equilibria in this debt market.
We now show that for γ sufficiently large, a symmetric monopoly contract can
be sustained as an equilibrium. Moreover, this result will hold independently
of the number of lenders. Increasing the number of lenders, therefore, does
not result in a competitive outcome.
If this market was dominated by a single lender, the monopolist would
solve:
maxr,d p(1 + r)d − d
s.t.
(1 − γ)f (d) ≥ (1 + r)d ,
and the optimal contract would satisfy

dM = [p(1 − γ)Aβ] 1−β .

rM =
−1.
pβ
Note that the size of the loan decreases with γ. In fact, if γ = 1, i.e., the
country can consume all of its output in the case of default, then dM = 0.
The interest rate is independent of the value of γ, but it does depend on the
value of β. That is, the greater the curvature in the production function,
i.e., the smaller the value of β, the larger the monopoly interest rate. This
interest rate compounds a compensation for risk, p1 , and a monopoly mark-up
1
.
β
Lenders who adopt this monopoly-price strategy run the risk of being undercut by a lender who can earn higher expected profits by making a larger
loan at a lower interest rate. We will examine these strategies further in
section 6 and the Appendix, however, it is worth spending a bit of time
developing some intuition for the unprofitability of defection from this symmetric monopoly equilibrium. Imagine first a market dominated by a single
13

monopolist. Another lender considers the possibility of finding a profitable
entry strategy. The lender might think of offering an additional loan at a
lower rate. Note that the borrower is still credit constrained at the monopoly
equilibrium, hence, the country will readily accept this new loan offer. However, note in addition, that the monopolist has extracted all of the possible
rents in the good productivity state, so that repayment would be possible
only if the new loan was offered below cost. Otherwise, the acceptance of the
new loan would push the country to default even in the good state. In either
case, this new loan is unprofitable. The lender’s only hope is to try to take
over the monopolist’s position. That is, to offer a large loan at a lower rate
that the country will accept instead of the monopolist’s contract. However,
for γ sufficiently large, and given the non-exclusivity of loan contracts, the
country will be better off taking both the monopolist’s loan and the entrant’s
large loan and defaulting on both. Once again, the potential entrant is left
without a profitable strategy.
In the case with many lenders, the intuition is very similar. For a lender
to offer a bigger loan, without inducing the country to reduce their borrowing
from one of the other lenders, simply induces default for the same reason as
with the single monopolist. On the other hand, offering a larger loan that
is attractive to the borrower and that will displace one of the other lenders
is confronted with the same default problem as before. For γ sufficiently
large, the country will not substitute the new larger loan for an old one, but
will prefer to take all loans offered and default on all loans. Lenders will
see that there is no scope for a profitable departure from the monopoly-price
equilibrium, and the equilibrium will be sustainable. Note in both cases,
however, that the sustainability of this equilibrium depends critically on the
value of γ. For small values of γ, rather than defaulting, the country could
be better off simply replacing expensive loans with cheaper ones which would
result in standard Bertand competition.
In this monopoly default equilibrium, lenders’ expected profits are given

function is close to linear, i.e., β close to 1. Nevertheless, even though
profits are potentially large, the monopoly outcome cannot be sustained as
an equilibrium for small values of γ.
The main conclusion of this section is that in an environment where
sovereign countries are able shelter a large fraction of their income when
they default, i.e., γ high, interest rates are higher than the cost of capital,
and a country will be able to borrow less than it could in a competitive
market.

Policies of a benevolent lending institution

In this section we analyze how an international organization such as the IMF
could influence equilibrium outcomes in the market for sovereign debt. For
simplicity we will continue with the assumption in the benchmark model of
the last section: θL = 0 and θH = 1. We analyze two possible cases. In
the first case we consider an IMF-like lender who enters this sovereign debt
market and makes loans at competitive interest rates. We ask whether this
activity could alter the structure of the market equilibrium and, in particular,
whether it would induce competition or promote monopoly-like outcomes.
In the second case, we assume that the IMF-like institution acts like an
insurance provider for the sovereign country. That is, the sovereign country
buys insurance from the institution against the prospect of the low state and
potential default. Again we ask whether this activity deters or promotes
competition in these markets.
A Lender of “First Resort”
Suppose the international institution is both able and willing to offer
a loan as large as the sovereign country needs at the competitive interest
rate. In a fairly obvious way, any private lenders not offering competitive
loans would be driven out of the market, and all profits would be driven to
zero. Therefore, if the IMF-like institution seeks to maximize a sovereign
country’s welfare by becoming an alternative source of competitively-priced
loans, then there is an equilibrium where this institution becomes the “lender
of first resort”, i.e., the only lender.
16

Perhaps more realistically we assume that the institution lacks the resources to do this on a large scale. In particular, let the maximum amount
that the institution can lend be equal to
dI = φdM ,
where φ is a number between zero and one, and dM denotes the amount that
a monopolistic lender would choose, i.e.,
1

dM = [p(1 − γ)Aβ] 1−β .
Note that provided that the institution does not lend enough to drive out
private lenders, the theorems above will still hold. That is, for γ sufficiently
large, there will be no zero-profit equilibria in the market for private loans
to sovereign countries. This activity may lead to both increases in the country’s utility and decreases in the profits of private lenders, however, it is not
sufficient to bring about a competitive equilibrium.
To illustrate the effects that this limited lending at competitive rates
can have on a monopolistic equilibrium, we will analyze how the symmetric
monopolistic outcome changes with this institutional intervention.
In this case lenders solve:

(both private and institutional) is equal to

+ (1 + ri )di =
,
p
pβ
i=1

which is independent of the value of φ. The cost to the country is the same
when the IMF-like institution does a lot of low-cost lending or very little.
All benefits of these low-interest loans are extracted by the strategic private
lenders who implement the monopoly strategy.
An implication of this equilibrium is that as φ → 1 the interest rate
charged by the international lenders goes to infinity and the amount they
lend goes to zero. Therefore, if the symmetric monopolistic outcome obtains,
limited institutional lending at competitive rates does not change either the
total amount lent to the country or the cost to the country of servicing their
debt.
Figure 3 depicts the increase in the value of γ necessary to sustain the
monopoly outcome as the size of the IMF loan increases. What this shows
is that even when the size of the loan offered by the institution is relatively
small, since this loan reduces the scope for monopoly-like equilibria (i.e., such
equilibria can only be sustained for larger values of γ), it could ultimately be
welfare enhancing for the country.
An Insurance Provider
Suppose the sovereign country can buy insurance against the low state
from the IMF-like institution. In particular, assume that if the low state
occurs then the institution pays the country’s debts to private lenders. In
exchange for this insurance, the sovereign country pays a premium, π, when
the high state is realized. The insurance is contracted before the private
credit market opens. In addition, we assume that the institution pays off
the country’s creditors in the low state only if the contracts are written such
that the country is able to repay both the premium and its debts in the high
state. Since there is symmetric information in this economy, ruling out moral
hazard in the high state seems reasonable.
The payment of the insurance premium has a consequence on the resulting
equilibrium. Recall that whenever dˆ > d¯ (that is, whenever the amount that

the country would like to borrow is greater than the amount that they can
credibly commit to repay), competitive equilibria cannot exist. In addition,
recall that with complete insurance, the competitive interest rate will be
driven down to the risk-free interest rate, assumed to be zero. The effect of
this lower rate is to increase both the country’s demand, i.e., dˆ increases,
¯
¯ however,
and its ability to credibly repay, i.e., dincreases.
This effect on d,
is mitigated since the country has to pay the insurance premium in the good
state, which lowers the amount of resources available to repay its debts. The
¯ which will rule out
net effect is to increase the distance between dˆ and d,
competitive contracts for even small values of γ. In other words, the benefits
of this type of intervention must be weighed against its negative consequences
for competition.
To see the potential benefits of intervention in the case of a symmetric
monopoly equilibrium, (i.e., γ sufficiently large), consider the objective of a
lender operating in the presence of this institutional insurance mechanism.
In this case, the typical lender solves:

When default is insured by the institution, we can obtain lenders’ expected profits for the monopoly default equilibrium:

20

Recall that profits in the comparable equilibrium without insurance are given
in equation (7). Note that profits in the insured case differ from the uninsured
case in two ways. Profits rise as a result of the increase in the total amount
lent to the country (this amount is higher since it no longer depends on p).
But profits also fall by the amount of the premium paid by the country to the
institution. Therefore, even though the structure of the insurance mechanism
would lead one to believe that the country is paying for the insurance, in
equilibrium, the insurance premium is actually funded through lower profits.
The expected profits of private lenders depend in a fairly obvious way on
the insurance pricing. Assuming γ is high, if the insurance is cheap bankers
will be better off since the insurance mechanism will allow them to increase
the loan amounts and they will still obtain positive profits. On the other
hand, if the premium is large, the rents that bankers can extract from the
country will drop and they will be worse off.
As a benchmark, consider the situation in which the institution charges
the sovereign country an actuarially fair price for this insurance. The premium in this case would be given by
π=

which are smaller than the profits lenders earn without the insurance mechanism. In other words, to make lenders better off under this insurance scheme,
the institution would have to subsidize insurance, and charge a lower premium than would be actuarily fair.
21

The country’s expected utility in this monopoly equilibrium with insurance is strictly larger than the comparable uninsured case. Since the
monopoly equilibrium will result in equality in the constraint given in equation (9), we know that expected utility in the insured case is given by
pγf (dIM ), compared to the uninsured case, pγf (dM ). Since the country is
able to borrow more when their loans are insured, i.e., dIM > dM , utility for
the country is strictly larger with insurance.
This welfare improvement is somewhat offset by the affect that insurance may have on competition. Since the lending institution is extracting
resources from the country in the good state whenever π > 0, the amount
that the country can credibly commit to repay in the good state will be lower.
Therefore, the default externality can rule out competitive equilibria for even
smaller values of γ. Overall, this insurance mechanism can have very different effects for different countries since the presence of the insurance decreases
the value of γ above which the competitive equilibrium cannot be sustained.
That is, the insurance mechanism can push a country that faces competitive
pricing into an equilibrium in which foreign investors gain positive profits,
which can have a substantial negative impact on the country’s welfare. On
the other hand, if a country is already facing monopoly pricing, then the
insurance will increase its welfare. In general, countries with large values of
γ will tend to benefit from the insurance, whereas countries with low values
of γ may be better off without it.

The general model revisited

The simple benchmark model allowed us to study in a relatively clear way,
the implications of an intervention in this sovereign debt market by an international financial institution. Given the restrictive assumption made on
the stochastic productivity shock, however, the benchmark model does not
allow us to study the consequences of different stochastic processes for the
equilibrium in this market. We now return to the general specification to
explore these cases in more detail, with special emphasis on the monopolistic
equilibria that might obtain.

22

Recall that there are two types of monopolistic equilibria. There is a
monopoly-like equilibrium with default in the low state and another where
the country never defaults. Given that we do in fact observe defaults in
sovereign debt markets, and since the monopoly-like equilibrium without default can only be sustained when the productivity shock has a very small
variance, we will restrict our analysis to the equilibria where the country
defaults in the low state. Given the need to explore all forms of profitable
defections from the symmetric monopoly equilibrium, and the complexity of
these possible strategies for the more general stochastic productivity shock,
we are unable to find simple closed-form expressions for the restrictions on
the structure of the economy that admit monopoly equilibria. We summarize these conditions in the Appendix and show that they correspond to a
relatively simple constrained optimization problem. For specific examples of
the theoretical economy. These problems are easy to solve numerically. We
now analyze these equilibria for a variety of numerical examples.
To study the effects of volatility on equilibrium outcomes, we parameterize the states using the mean, variance and probability:

Therefore, E[θ̃] = µ and V ar(θ̃) = σ 2 . The following graphs show the (γ, σ)
pairs for which the symmetric monopolistic outcome obtains in equilibrium.
Figures 4, 5, and 6 depict the threshold values of γ that will support the
monopoly equilibrium for large values of M .
A number of patterns in the relationship between the productivity-shock
parameters and sustainability of a monopoly-price equilibrium emerge from
these numerical results. The value of γ that would support a monopoly-price
equilibrium decreases as:
1. the mean decreases
2. volatility increases, and

3. the probability of the high state increases.
The lenders’ strategy in case of the monopoly-price equilibrium involves a
tradeoff between the cost of default when the low state occurs and the profits
earned when the high state occurs. Therefore, to interpret these patterns,
it is helpful to think in terms of the debt capacity of the country in the low
state and the interest rate charged by lenders who adopt the monopoly-price
strategy. In general, when σ is relatively small, the debt burden that the
country can repay in both states of the world will also be relatively large,
since θL is close to θH . In a monopoly-price equilibrium a large fraction
of this debt burden will be interest rather than principal since the interest
rate charged by the typical lender following the monopoly strategy will be
very high. To see that monopoly-price equilibria can only be sustained for
countries with high values of γ when σ is small (or θL is relatively large),
consider the incentives of the marginal lender to offer a contract such that
the country will repay in the low state. If all other lenders are following
the monopoly-price strategy, the marginal lender may have an incentive to

deviate and offer a larger contract at a lower interest rate. (For example, if
this interest rate is sufficiently low and θL is sufficiently high that the debt
burden is small enough that it can be repaid even in the low state, then
the marginal lender may increase profits by deviating from the monopoly
strategy.) If this deviation is attempted for a country with a large value of
γ, i.e., a country for which there is little penalty associated with default,
the country would be willing to accept but not repay a contract at a lower
interest rate. In that case, a lender would have no incentive to deviate from
the monopoly strategy. Therefore, when σ is relatively small, the monopolyprice strategy will only be an equilibrium for countries with relatively high
values of γ.
Note that the other patterns displayed in these figures, i.e., mean increase,
and high-state probability decrease, result in an increase in θL . Their effects
on the sustainability of a monopoly equilibrium are all very similar to the
decrease in σ described in detail above. As θL increases, the monopoly equilibrium can only be sustained for countries with increasingly higher values of
γ.

Another way to see these effects is to look at the condition that allows
profitable deviation. Profitable deviation will be possible only if:
(1 − γ)θL f (dM + di ) −

1 M
d > di ,
pβ

where the dM is the total amount of loans offered under the monopoly-price
contract, and di is the size of the defector’s loan.3 Note that the three
parameter changes discussed above all act to decrease the left-hand side of
this inequality, hence, making deviation impossible.
Instead of analyzing the symmetric monopolistic outcome, one could ask
whether a single monopolist could corner the market in such a way that it
is optimal for other lenders not to offer any loans. One can show that a
single monopolist can indeed corner the market, provided γ and σ are high
enough, as shown in Figures 4, 5, and 6. The intuition is basically the same.
3

This restriction assumes that the country accepts all contracts. The appendix deals
with the more general case where the country is allowed to accept only a fraction of the
contracts offered.

26

For σ high enough, offering contracts such that the country repays in both
states of the world is not possible because there is just not enough output
produced in the low state. Furthermore, for γ high enough, the country will
be able to consume a large fraction of the total output in default, and hence
any contract offered with an interest rate higher than p1 will induce default.
Given that the monopoly contract is being offered, there is no possibility to
enter the market and generate a positive profit. Therefore, the other lenders
will optimally offer the contract d = 0, r = 0.4

7

Extensions

In this section we examine three important extensions to the basic model
presented above. First we consider the case of state-contingent debt contracts. We allow lenders to index the interest rate to the realization of the
productivity shock. Given the assumption of full and symmetric information, this seems like a natural contract for lenders to offer. In this context,
we also extend the model to allow a more general multiple-state (i.e., more
than 2-states) stochastic process. Finally, we allow for renegotiation in the
case of default. Working in the context of a relatively static model, our specification of renegotiation is necessarily simple, however, it yields results that
are suggestive for the likely consequence of allowing renegotiation in a more
dynamic setting.

7.1

Contingent Contracts and Multiple States

In the previous sections we have assumed that lenders offer standard debt
contracts. Here we show that if state-contingent contracts are offered instead, the monopoly-like equilibrium can still be sustained for sufficiently
large values of γ. Furthermore, we show that in this case the monopoly profits increase relative to non-contingent contracting, since the monopoly rents
can be extracted from the country in all states by charging different rates in

Numerical examples have also shown that this monopoly approach may also provide
a simpler numerical algorithm for finding the symmetric Nash equilibrium, relative to the
method detailed in section 6.

the different states of the world. Generalization to a multiple-state stochastic
process is straightforward.
Consider the case where there is a single monopolist lender.5 This lender
offers a contract {dM , rM (θi )}i=1,...K . The state θi occurs with probability
P
p(θi ). Denote the mean of the productivity shock as θ̄ = i p(θi )θi . The
risk-neutral monopolist will choose a state-contingent contract to maximize
expected profits:

The following theorem establishes that this monopoly equilibrium can be
sustained provided γ is sufficiently large.
Theorem 4 There exists a value of γ for which the monopoly contract can
be sustained as an equilibrium.
Proof: Suppose there is a lender offering the monopoly contract and the rest
are offering the zero contract. If lender j deviates and offers another contract,
say {dj , rj (θi )}, for i = 1, ...K, then the country has two options. If it accepts
both contracts, then the maximum that the deviating lender can obtain is

accepts only the contract offered by lender j then its utility equals

Now, for γ large and dj > 0, we have that

profits are larger with state-contingent contracts than with a non-contingent

7.2

Renegotiation

Up until now, we have assumed that if the country defaults, lenders loose
the entire principal of their loan and the country consumes only a fraction of
their output. Therefore, default represents a deadweight loss to the economy.
In this section, we would ask how sensitive the results are to this assumption. In particular, we could like to know how an ex post renegotiation in
which the lender can potentially recapture some of their capital would affect
the equilibrium. Clearly this will depend on how renegotiation is modeled.
For example, assume that lending is dominated by a single monopolist and
another lender, say lender j, offers a contract that pushes the country into
default. If lender j is able to extract a large fraction of the output through a
renegotiation then it might indeed be profitable for him to enter the market
even though it induces the country to default. The logic of this example will
also translate to the symmetric monopoly problem
To further illustrate this point, consider a deterministic economy. That is,
θ = θL = 1. Assume
is a monopolist lender offering a debt contract
³ there
´
0
M
such that (1 − γ)f d
= 1. We’ve shown that if γ is large, this is an
equilibrium. Assume that lender j enters the market and offers a contract
such that the country decides to default. Furthermore, assume that³lender j ´is
able to extract a fraction δ(dj , dM ) of the deadweight loss, (1−γ)f dM + dj ,
during the renegotiation.6 Lender j will enter the market if and only if
H

³

´

δ(1 − γ)f dM + dj − dj > 0 .
Alternatively, lender j will enter the market provided its marginal revenue is
larger than its marginal cost:
³
´
³
´
∂δ(dj , dM )
(1 − γ)f dM + dj + δ(1 − γ)f 0 dM + dj ≥ 1 .
∂dj

The second term on the right-hand side of this inequality is less than one
by concavity of f . The first term is positive, but its magnitude depends on
6

The fraction δ could conceivably also depend on rj . We abstract from that case to rule
out a strategy in which lender j could offer a contract with rj = ∞ when δ is increasing
in rj , and get all the surplus from the renegotiation.

30

∂δ(dj ,dM )
.
∂dj

Therefore, the entry decision for lender j depends critically on the
rate at which the amount recovered during the renegotiation increases with
loan size. For example, if δ was a constant that was sufficiently smaller than
1, i.e., there is still a significant dead-weight loss associated with default, the
symmetric monopoly equilibrium would be preserved even with the prospect
of a renegotiation ex post. Note that this logic extends quite naturally to the
case of a random productivity shock.

Conclusion

We have shown how non-competitive outcomes can be sustained in sovereign
credit markets even though there are many lenders and complete and symmetric information. By extending the model of Parlour and Rajan (2000)
to include stochastic productivity shocks and equilibrium default, we derive
conditions under which perfectly competitive equilibria can be ruled out.
Moreover, we show that given a sufficiently large incentive for a sovereign
country to default, i.e., the sovereign can consume a relatively large share of
their output in the case of default, monopoly-like outcomes for interest rates
and loan size can be sustained as equilibria. The existence of monopolylike equilibria in these types of markets depends critically on the fraction of
income that the sovereign can retain in the case of default, and on the distribution of random productivity shocks that governs default probabilities. We,
therefore, solve for threshold values of this fraction that change with the production technology and the properties of the stochastic productivity shock.
Counter-intuitively, given the possibility of a non-competitive equilibrium,
the sovereign country would be better off if it were unable to consume any
of its income in the case of default. Lenders, on the other hand, can benefit
greatly in equilibrium from a sovereign country’s ability to consume in default. In addition, our model has the property that output volatility plays
a key role both in providing an environment conducive to non-competitive
outcomes, and also to breaking the link between the terms of loan contracts
and competitive fundamentals like default probabilities. As output becomes
more volatile, monopoly-like equilibria become more likely, and interest rates
can be much larger than would be justified by default probabilities alone.
We also explore how a benevolent institution like the IMF can affect
31

equilibrium outcomes in these markets. Depending on the incentives of the
institution, the outcomes can be somewhat surprising. We show that if in a
monopoly equilibrium the IMF offers loans at competitive interest rates, it
drives out all private lenders, thereby becoming the “lender of first resort.” If
the IMF can only lend a fraction of the loans that private lenders would provide, the country’s total borrowing and total borrowing costs are unaffected,
and the institution’s surplus is extracted by private lenders.
Alternatively, if we model the IMF as an insurance mechanism for sovereign
borrowers that lends only in states where the sovereign defaults (i.e., a
“lender of last resort”), a country that is already facing monopoly-like pricing
will receive an increase in welfare. However, this type of insurance mechanism can push a country that might otherwise face competitive pricing into
a situation where positive-profit equilibria, or even monopoly-like equilibria,
can be sustained.
Finally, we show how the monopoly-like equilibria might be affected by
changes in the economic environment. In particular, we show that most of
our results will hold even when lenders are allowed to offer state-contingent
debt contracts in an environment with many states, and when we allow for
the possibility of renegotiation.

Appendix
In this appendix we summarize a set of necessary conditions for the existence
of the symmetric monopoly equilibrium when the stochastic productivity
shock has a more general distribution than that of the benchmark case of
section 4.
A monopolistic lender in the general model would solve:
max p(1 + r)d − d
d,r

subject to
pf (d, θH )) + (1 − p)γf (d, θL ) − p(1 + r)d ≥ γf (d, E[θ̃]) .
This constraint is identical to the one obtained when θL = 0. Therefore, as
in that case, the equilibrium interest rate is given by
D
rM
=

1
−1,
pβ

and the equilibrium loan size is given by
1

H
1−β .
dD
M = [pθ (1 − γ)Aβ]

Relaxing the assumption that θL = 0 complicates things substantially
because there are now more deviation possibilities for the marginal lender.
For example, the marginal lender could have an incentive to deviate and offer
a contract such that the country is better off repaying in both states of the
world. This can happen when θL and θH are very close, i.e., when volatility
is low. Nevertheless relaxing the assumption that θL = 0 allows us to analyze
how increases in volatility affect the equilibria. It is in general not possible
to characterize the region where the symmetric monopolistic type outcome
obtains analytically. Therefore, we will explore these equilibria numerically.
We now determine conditions for the symmetric monopolistic default contracts to be sustainable as an equilibrium. As in the case of the competitive
equilibrium analyzed above, we will start by defining loan amounts that
35

are of particular interest. As before, the threshold loan size ³for the ´low

D
state, d¯L (rM
), is defined implicitly by the equation (1 − γ)θL f d¯L (rM

D ¯L D
(1 + rM )d (rM ). For our particular production function we get

Note that dˆH > dˆL .
For the symmetric monopolistic contracts to be an equilibrium we need
to find conditions such that if all lenders offer the monopolistic contract, the
country will accept all contracts. That is, the country’s demand for loans at
the monopolistic interest rate is at least as big as the total amount offered.
This will be the case when the following conditions are satisfied:

The first condition indicates that, for the monopolistic outcome to hold, the
country has to be rationed. This is the analog to the condition in Theorem
1. The last two conditions guarantee that the country won’t be better off
accepting only a fraction of the contracts offered and repaying in both states
of the world.
Given the contracts offered by all other lenders the marginal lender has
three basic options:
1. He can offer the same contract as the others. This needs to be the case
for the symmetric equilibrium to obtain.
2. The marginal lender could offer a contract such that the country is
better off accepting his contract and a fraction of the contracts offered
by the other lenders. There are two possibilities that we need to check
in this case, since the fraction accepted plus the marginal loan could
be such that the country defaults or not in the low state.
3. Finally, the lender could offer a contract such that the country decides
to take only that contract and reject all the other contracts offered. As
before, this marginal contract could be such that the country decides
to default or not in the low state.
The usual intuition that by offering a lower rate and a larger loan the
marginal lender can make a profit doesn’t necessarily hold in this model,
because the country may have an incentive to take all contracts and default.
For the country to be willing to accept only a fraction of the contracts offered at higher rates, the loan with the lower rate has to be relatively large.
But, for large values of γ, the country will tend to be better off defaulting
than repaying when the loan amounts are large due to the concavity of the
production function.
Given that all other lenders are offering the same monopolistic type contract, the marginal lender, i, will seek to maximize its expected profits subject
37

to the best response of the country to the contracts offered. Recall that the
country can choose which contracts to accept and whether to default or not.
This implies two possible strategies for the country which the marginal lender
must consider. The country could default in the low state but repay in the
high state, or it could repay in both states. If the marginal lender decides to
offer a contract such that the country defaults in the low state but repays in
the high state, then the following two conditions need to be satisfied:

and
D
θH f (di + φH D−i )−(1+ri )di −(1+rM
)D−i φH ≥ γθH f (di + φH D−i ) , (15)

where φH is the fraction of the loans offered by the other lenders that the
country chooses to accept.
The first constraint guarantees that the country prefers accepting a fraction φH of the other loans and repaying in the high state, to taking all loans
and defaulting in both states. The second constraint guarantees repayment in
the high state. It is straightforward to show that the first constraint implies
the second.
The country will choose φH to maximize its expected utility. Given that
the contracts offered are such that the country defaults in the low state and
repays in the high state, its expected utility equals:

The optimal fraction of loans, φH , will therefore satisfy:

Therefore, the marginal lender will have an incentive to deviate if and only
if:

vHi >
(p(1 + rM

To solve for vHi we will split the problem into three different maximization problems. We will find the marginal lender’s value function for
ˆ
i
φH = 1, φH = dHD−d
and φH = 0. Denote these value functions as vH1,i , vH2,i
−i
and vH3,i , respectively. Note that a monopolistic equilibrium requires vH1,i >
vH2,i , vH1,i > vH3,i .
In an analogous way, we can solve for the case where the country repays
in both states, which would yield expected utility for the country denoted by
vLi . Solving the optimization problem analogous to equation (16), implies
the optimal fraction of loans:

As before, to solve for vL i we will split the problem into three different
maximizations, and find the marginal lender’s value function for φL = 1, φL =
D )−d
dˆL (rM
I
and φL = 0. For the monopolistic outcome to be an equilibrium
D−i
we need vH1,i > vL1,i , vH1,i > vL2,i and vH1,i > vL3,i .
Note that although solving these optimization problems that define the
equilibria is difficult analytically, it is a relatively standard set of constrained
optimization problems that can be easily solved numerically.
