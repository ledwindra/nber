ABSTRACT
The mandate of the Federal Reserve has evolved considerably over its hundred-year history. From
an initial focus in 1913 on financial stability, to fiscal financing in World War II and its aftermath,
to a strong anti-inflation focus from the late 1970s, and then back to greater emphasis on financial
stability since the Great Contraction. Yet, as the Fed’s mandate has expanded in recent years, its range
of instruments has narrowed, partly based on a misguided belief in the inherent stability of financial
markets. We briefly discuss the active use in an earlier era of multiple instruments, including reserve
requirements, credit controls and interest rate ceilings.

An Act To provide for the establishment of Federal Reserve banks, to furnish an elastic currency,
to afford means of rediscounting commercial paper, to establish a more effective supervision of
banking in the United States, and for other purposes. Federal Reserve Act, December 23, 1913.
After recurring bouts of financial panics and banking crises, and a particularly severe one
in 1907, a clamor arose among policy circles and the business community that the United States
was in need of serious banking and currency reform. Part of this reform would be the creation of
an institution that would, when the system was threatened with periodic regional or national
financial crises, provide the necessary liquidity to support the banks that were in duress—the socalled provision of an elastic currency. As the opening line of the Federal Reserve Act clearly
articulates, financial stability took center stage in the initial mandate of the United States’ central
bank. While the Federal Reserve Act defined the supervisory duties of the Fed, there is no
mention of a price stability mandate in the original version of the legislation. Indeed, the word
inflation does not appear at all in the document. A full employment macroeconomic goal is not
even remotely alluded to.
It is probable that in 1913, while financial panics were not uncommon, high inflation was
still largely seen by the founders of the Fed as a relatively rare phenomenon associated with wars
and their immediate aftermath. Figure 1 plots the US price level from 1775 (set equal to one)
until 2012. In 1913 prices were only about 20 percent higher than in 1775 and around 40 percent
lower than in 1813, during the War of 1812. Whatever the mandates of the Federal Reserve, it is
clear that the evolution of the price level in the United States is dominated by the abandonment
of the gold standard in 1933 and the adoption of fiat money subsequently. One hundred years
after its creation, consumer prices are about 30 times higher than what they were in 1913. This
pattern, in varying orders of magnitudes, repeats itself across nearly all countries.

In the next section, we sketch how the mandates of the Fed have morphed over time from
a predominantly financial stability goal at its outset in 1913, to facilitating fiscal financing during
WWII and its aftermath, to a higher emphasis on inflation stabilization and price stability from
the late 1970s until the 2007 subprime crisis. Now, possibly, the pendulum is swinging back to
place a greater weight on its initial mandate of financial stability, which policymakers and
financial markets had come to take for granted during the post-war era.
In Section II we present evidence to suggest that across all these regimes, whether the
mandate was financial stability, low inflation and full employment, or public debt monetization,
short-term policy interest rates (prices) are usually not a sufficient statistic to characterize
monetary or liquidity conditions at a point in time. As recently stressed in Schularick and Taylor
(2012), we emphasize credit developments (quantities) to supplement interest rates and provide a
comprehensive view of financial conditions.

Central banks in the US and elsewhere have multiple goals the likelihood of achieving
these may be enhanced by having multiple instruments at their disposal. Policies, such as
changes in reserve and margin requirements and a variety of credit measures that have been
discarded as antiquated may find renewed favor in the post-crisis environment as part of the
toolkit of the central bank in the US and other advanced economies. These instruments have
continued to play a central role in defining monetary policy in many emerging markets to the
present day. In principle, of course, other regulators can and should play a role, but the
experience of overly narrowing the central bank’s purview has not proved an entirely successful
one.
I. Targets and Instruments: A 100-Year Timeline
At the risk of a gross simplification, the Federal Reserve’s first centennial can be roughly
divided into three subperiods. From its creation in 1913 until the 1930s its primary mandate was
financial stability. The second phase was an era of “fiscal dominance” from the outset of World
War II until the late 1970s (the 1951 Fed–Treasury accord notwithstanding), when the Fed
facilitated fiscal financing in varying degrees, albeit often in the name of employment. From
1979, beginning with an aggressive inflation stabilization plan until the crisis of 2007, the third
phase, (an independent Fed) was guided by a mandate of price stability and macroeconomic
stabilization. It is premature to characterize the fourth phase ushered in by the 2007– crisis.
Table 1, which shades the eras, provides highlights of this timeline and guides our discussion.
Our aim is not merely to recap the past but to draw some lessons for the future and better
understand the present. With a cumulative output collapse of 31 percent from 1929 until 1933
and the number of banks operating cut roughly in half over 1925–1933, it is safe to conclude that
4

the early Federal Reserve failed miserably at meeting its initial mandate of financial stability.
This failure led to the establishment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and

its supervision mandate. During the course of the 1930s a relatively laissez faire approach to
financial markets (both domestically and internationally) gave way to a significant increase in
the regulation of the financial industry and erected barriers to the international flow of financial
capital that was the hallmark of the now-defunct gold standard. This wave of financial deglobalization, while somewhat more extreme, is not unlike the trends that have been set in
motion by the recent crisis, especially in Europe. During this first era, the Fed did have multiple
instruments at its disposal apart from setting interest rates. Unfortunately, some of these
instruments of policy were employed procyclically. For example, reserve requirements were

5

doubled (from 13 to 26 percent) between 1935 and 1937 in the midst of the Depression (see
Table 1).
While substantial public debts were accumulated during the 1930s (see Reinhart and
Rogoff, 2009), there is nothing in US history to match the debt build up that would accompany
WWII. For about four decades (1939–1978) the Fed would remain largely subservient to the
Treasury. Interest rates were capped, credit ceilings remained in place through the early 1950s,
and financial repression domestically and abroad ruled the day. Whatever distortions these
policies may have led to in terms of the misallocation of resources, it is important to note that
from 1945 until the late 1970s there were no systemic banking crises in the United States or
elsewhere. Such a long uninterrupted period of tranquility was a new phenomenon in the history
of finance. Ultimately, the sustained monetary policy accommodation combined with adverse
supply shocks gave way to persistent inflation (see Figure 1) and ushered in the more recent era
of an independent Fed with the restoration of price stability as its main mandate.1
To understand the shift in mandate and focus of the Federal Reserve during 1979–2007, it
is necessary to briefly review key features of its prior incarnations. The fact that the experience
of the 1930s gave rise to other institutions that took on supervisory responsibilities helped pave
the way, in principle, for the Fed to focus more of its energy on the goal of inflation and
countercyclical macroeconomic stabilization in the modern era. It is notable that post WWII, the
highly regulated financial markets with their intense home bias gave rise to only a few crises in
advanced economies (especially in comparison to the panic-ridden pre-war era). This quietus
facilitated the view in both academic and policy circles that advanced economies had outgrown

It has to be noted that what was achieved in the era of the “great moderation” was inflation

severe financial crises, and that these were a phenomenon confined to the emerging markets. In
an environment where other supervisory institutions and financial markets were thought to be
monitoring risk, the Fed mandate eventually narrowed to emphasize inflation and
unemployment. As the mandate became more focused, older instruments of monetary policy
were discarded as distortionary and obsolete. Reserve and margin requirements as well as other
policies designed to curb credit growth and leverage were relegated to history. Interest rate
policy and communications strategies became the sole instruments of monetary policy.
In the next section, we suggest that irrespective of the changes in the Fed’s mandates,
credit aggregates merit a larger role in setting policy and gauging financial conditions—
especially if financial stability regains a more prominent role in policy design.
II. Interest Rates and Credit
In the past three decades, the behavior and evolution of private credit has received
comparatively little attention as an indicator of aggregate demand, inflationary pressures, or as a
potential early warning of financial vulnerability. On the latter score, the key role of credit
booms in anticipating financial crises in advanced economies since the late 19th century is
extensively documented by Schularick and Taylor (2012). The evidence for emerging markets
presented in Mendoza and Terrones (2012) is equally compelling; as they observe, not every
credit boom ends in crisis but nearly all crises are preceded by credit booms.
Here we present evidence that across time and regimes ranging from the relatively
globalized and laissez faire financial system of the “roaring 1920s” and pre-2007 crisis to the
post-WWII financial repression era, the behavior of credit has provided valuable and
complementary information about the “de facto” stance of monetary policy (or, more accurately,
monetary or liquidity conditions) to that incorporated in the short-term policy interest rate. To
7

clarify, we follow the widely accepted convention that the intent to tighten/ease monetary policy
is signaled primarily through an increase/decrease in policy interest rate(s) and that this intent
defines “de jure” policy. Along those lines, Romer and Romer (1989) are more concerned with
defining policy intent. Here we suggest that credit conditions may re-enforce the changes in the
policy interest rate at a given point in time or they may counteract those changes. Thus de facto
monetary or liquidity conditions may on occasion substantially differ from what might be
perceived based on interest rates alone.
A. An illustration for consumer credit: 1919–2012
Given the depth of its equity, corporate bond, and commercial paper markets, the United
States is considered to be the least bank-dependent economy in the world, at least when it comes
to corporate finance. For households, however, banks play a dominant role in the US as they do
in other countries. Hence, our focus on consumer credit here.2 With a secular shift to an urban
society since the early 20th century, household credit as a share of disposable income has risen
steadily year after year, as part of what is often called financial deepening. As Figure 2 shows,
since 1919 the nominal stock of consumer credit outstanding has shown substantial annual
declines during only three episodes: the collapse of the banking system during the Great
Depression, the credit rationing during World War II, and in 2009 at the height of the Subprime
Crisis. While the most recent credit contraction is not as severe as the wartime or Depression
credit collapses, a 4.3 percent decline in nominal consumer credit in 2009 is far removed from
the 8.2 average yearly percent increase recorded over 1919–2012.

2

Consumer credit was also the main target of the credit ceiling policies of the 1940s–1980.
8

Since, as shown in Figure 2, only 9 of the 93 annual observations show a contraction in
consumer credit (and these 9 observations are clustered in three episodes), it will be more
informative to describe credit conditions in terms of whether credit growth is accelerating or
decelerating in a particular year. In addition, to describe whether monetary policy is tighter or
more accommodative, we focus on the basis point change in interest rates in a given year. Since
1955 we use the federal funds rate, while the discount rate fills that role over 1913–1954.

Our aim is to assess year by year whether the signals coming from credit tend to reenforce or offset the signals coming from interest rates. A year when the policy rate is declining
and credit growth is accelerating is counted as an observation of unambiguous easing as both
indicators of monetary conditions re-enforce. With interest rates being the primary instrument, a
9

year in which rates are falling but credit growth is unchanged or decelerating is counted as mixed
easing. A neutral to easier observation comes from a year where the policy interest rate is
unchanged but credit growth is accelerating. Symmetric definitions apply for tightening.
The results of this accounting exercise for 1921–2012 (92 years) are presented in Table 2.
Prior to examining the results, it is important to highlight some of the limitations of the
exercise. First, whether credit is accelerating or decelerating, the data point reflects a final
outcome; further analysis would be required to sort out whether the observed outcome primarily
owes to supply or demand shifts. Second, we look at credit momentum and interest rate changes
to characterize a particular year; their dynamic relationship is not explored. It is to be expected
that sometimes rising interest rates will show up only in a deceleration in credit and only in the
following year. Similarly, a credit boom in an overheated economy may lead to a deliberate
policy tightening and rising policy interest rates that do not immediately gain traction in credit
markets. Third, while interest rates are taken to be the primary instrument (really the only
instrument in the post-1980s financial liberalization period), this was not always the case.
Reserve requirement changes were also a part of the policy toolkit in an earlier era. Even more
explicitly impacting credit was the past use of credit controls, as highlighted in Table 1. Credit
controls were used during World War II, also in its immediate aftermath, and most recently in
1980 under President Carter.3
With these caveats in mind, we turn to the results presented in Table 2, which distributes
the 92 annual observations into the seven buckets that range from unambiguously tight to

motivated by inflation stabilization efforts rather that by concerns about rising leverage and its
impact on financial stability.

unambiguously easy monetary or liquidity conditions. Note that less than a fourth (23 percent)
of the observations fall into the two extreme unambiguous categories, where interest rates and
credit both send the same signal. Furthermore, this pattern does not vary across regimes,
whether the regime is defined by the primary goal of the Federal Reserve at the time or by the
degree of international capital mobility and/or domestic financial regulation.
Over a quarter of the time, when declining interest rates were signaling a more
accommodative monetary policy stance, credit was decelerating. This situation characterizes
most of the post-2007 crisis years. In both 2008 and 2009 interest rates fell sharply, yet,
quantitative easing notwithstanding, consumer credit growth decelerated sharply. As noted
earlier, one cannot definitely apportion the observed deceleration in credit between, for example,
a tightening of lending standards versus weak demand due to weak consumer balance sheets and
recession.

More than 23 percent of the time, rising policy interest rates are not accompanied by
slowing credit (i.e., mixed tightening category). Several observations from the high inflation
years of the 1970s fall in this bucket. Perhaps it owes to interest rate increases that were
insufficient, only following or accommodating the rapid rise of inflation at that time. By contrast,
Table 3, which lists the years where credit and the policy rate gave re-enforcing signals, flags the
famous Volcker anti-inflation tightening that began in October 1979. The double signal also
captures the now notorious procyclical tightening in 1931 that involved a 150 basis point
increase in the discount rate alongside a 17 percent deceleration in credit growth, which also
makes the list. Notably, all the dates of unambiguous tightening map well onto the NBER’s
dating of recessions, as these followed the policy change within one or two years. Years of
unambiguous easing include 1933 and 1934 after the abandonment of the gold standard, 1983
(the Fed actually began lowering rates in August 1982), and the early 1990s. Recent years do
not figure in this list.

III. Policy Implications: Back to the Future
In the post-crisis environment, the Federal Reserve is likely to attach a greater weight to a
financial stability objective than it had prior to the crisis—at least for some time. Since the price
stability and full employment goals have not been set aside, we call attention to the fact that
multiple policy goals usually call for multiple instruments. Yet over the past three decades both
the academic literature and the policy practice have increasingly drifted to a world view where
the short-term policy rate is a sufficient policy instrument. The theoretical underpinnings
12

supporting that view usually assume complete markets, an assumption that is particularly at odds
with a post-crisis environment riddled with a broad assortment of frictions arising from both
market failures and a steady stream of complex regulatory changes set in motion by the crisis. In
that environment, policies such as changes in reserve and margin requirements and a variety of
credit measures that have been discarded as antiquated may possibly re-emerge in some form as
part of the toolkit of central banks in the US and other advanced economies, at least until a far
more robust and effective regulatory superstructure is firmly in place. As just one example, if
the Federal Reserve had greater capacity to impose reserve requirements, today’s quantitative
easing policies would hold less exit risks, and correspondingly could be employed more
aggressively.
