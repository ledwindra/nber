    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper examines in detail the factors that influence the probability of new entrants leaving their first job after completing school, including the differential effects of company provided training, apprenticeships, and training received off-the-job from for profit proprietary institutions. Particular attention is paid to how training effects vary by race, gender and educational attainment. In the paper it is shown that the majority of company provided training spells begin after an employee has been with an employer for at least one year while the majority of off-the-job training spells begin during the first year with an employer. Overall there is no significant difference in the probability of leaving the first employer by gender. Company provided training results in a lower probability of leaving an employer while off-the-job training increases the probability of leaving the first employer. Both of these effects are especially strong for women.\n\n",
