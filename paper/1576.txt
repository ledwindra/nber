Exchange Rate and Current Account
Dynamics Under Rational Expectations:
An Econometric Analysis

ABSTRACT

An econometric portfolio balance model of an open economy, incorporating
exchange rate, price, and current account dynamics, is derived and estimated.
The usual stability conditions do not guarantee a unique rational expectations
solution, and several proposals for resolving this situation are considered.
Using constrained maximum likelihood methods, the model is estimated for Japan.

The estimation results indicate that the model is quite successful in explaining

the patterns found in the data. The model is estimated using several methods of
resolving the question of non—uniqueness, and the results are compared.

tntroduction

Continued experience with flexible exchange rates for industrialized
countries has stimulated a considerable amount of research on the relationship

between the exchange rate, price level, and current account. Dornbusch (1976)

and Mussa (1982) highlight the role of rational expectations and the
relationship between the money supply, slow price adjustment, and exchange rate

determination. Kouri (1976), Calvo and Rodriguez (1977), Dornbusch and Fischer

(1980), Rodriguez (1980), and Mussa (1980) extend the rational expectations
approach into a more general portfolio balance framewok to emphasize the effects

of current account imbalances on the exchange rate. Recent work by Branson and

Buiter (1983) considers both types of models while Eaton and Turnovsky (1983)
and Buiter and Miller (1983) combine slow price and slow asset adjustment in a
single model.

While this research has been motivated by empirical phenomena, there has
been very little explicit econometric work on these models suitable for testing
alternative hypotheses, estimating parameters, or conducting quantitative policy
experiments.

In this paper, an econometric portfolio balance model with

rational expectations is constructed in the spirit of the theoretical research

mentioned above.

The model extends this earlier work by incorporating a

stochastic structure within a framework that includes both portfolio balance and

slow price adjustment, tracing Out how the structure influences the dynamics of

exchange rate expectations, and deriving the constraints between the portfolio

balance, current account, and price level equations. By incorporating Mussa's

(1982) price adjustment formulation into the portfolio balance framework, a

—2—

model is derived which, while encompassing exchange rate, price, and current
account dynamics, can be solved analytically.
accounting

The model is

capable

of

for various patterns of correlation between the exchange rate and the

current account.

A major focus of the paper is on the uniqueness of the rational
expectations

solution.

Even after the imposition of the usual stability

condition, non—uniqueness emerges in this model, not as an aberration, hut as a

quite plausible outcome. The methods for achieving a unique solution proposed

by Taylor (1977) and McCallum (1983) are considered,

It is shown that they

coincide in this model.

The model is then estimated for Japan, using quarterly data since the
advent of generalized floating in 1973. The estimation results accord well with
the theory, with most of the structural and policy coefficients of the expected
sign and significant. The estimates, which incorporate the constraints proposed
by Taylor and McCallum to achieve a unique solution, are contrasted with a less

restrictive set of estimates of a type proposed by Chow (1983). These do not
constrain the model to any particular solution, but instead allow the solution

to be determined by the data. We find that the two sets of estimates provide
very similar results.

The effects of various disturbances on the dynamics of

the exchange rate, current account, and domestic price level are illustrated by

the moving average representation.

The model is estimated by constrained

maximum likelihood methods recently used by Sargent (1978) and Taylor (1980) for
closed economy rational expectations models.

The paper is organized as follows:

Section 2 describes the model.

Section 3 derives the rational expectations solution and considers various

—3—

methods to achieve uniqueness. In Section 4, an estimatable form of the model

is derived, the cross equation restrictions are imposed, and the model is
estimated.

The results from implementing McCallum and Taylor's and Chow's

techniques are compared, and the dynamics of the model are illustrated by the
moving average representation. Conclusions are presented in Section 5.

The Model

In this section, we construct a portfolio balance model of an open economy

which incorporates a number of simplifying assumptions that enable us to focus
on exchange rate, price, and current account dynamics. The country is small in

world markets and produces a single (traded) good. Purchasing power parity is
assumed to hold in the long run but, since demand for the good is not perfectly

elastic, not instantaneously. Domestic residents hold two assets, domestic and
1

foreign currencies, while foreigners hold only the foreign asset.

Equilibrium in the asset market is expressed by equating the supply of
money with its demand, which depends on domestic income, domestic wealth, and

expected rate of depreciation is

e.

The disturbance term (as well as
3

the ri's below) is a random variable, which may be serially correlated.

The consumer price index is a weighted average of the price of the domestic

good and the price of the foreign good expressed in terms of domestic currency

(e + pt).

domestic consumption,

The demand for domestic assets is assumed to increase with income and
wealth and to decrease with the expected rate of depreciation. The asset market

equilibrium equation incorporates current realizations of variables which, as

will be shown below, include current shocks.

The two traditional perspectives are that higher income, by

imports,

causes a deficit, and that higher income, by raising

absorption less than proportionately, causes a surplus.

Recent work on the

current account in a utility maximizing framework, such as Sachs (1981) and
Obstfeld (1983), does not give us a determinate answer because, as will be seen

below, output will depend on relative prices.
foreign

Analogously, the effect of

income on the current account is also indeterminate. An increase in

domestic wealth is

assumed

to decrease savings and to cause a deficit.

The specification of the current account equation assumes that export and
import decisions are made at the beginning of the period, based on the values of

domestic income, foreign income, and wealth at the end of the previous period.

Since trade does not take place instantaneously, the current account evolves
during the period.

Thus the stock of foreign assets is pre—determined in the

sense that it is not affected by the current realizations of other variables.
It is affected, however, by the current realization of the disturbance term E2t

the expected rate of change of the equilibrium price level plus some proportion

is the expectation of the (exchange rate, foreign price level)

for period t, conditional on information available at the end of period t — 1.

The equilibrium price level is postulated to be the price level at which
purchasing power parity is satisfied, and thus equals e + p. Domestic prices,
like the stock of foreign assets, are predetermined in the sense that they are

unaffected by current realizations of other variables, although they are
affected by the realization of E3t.
Domestic output is assumed to depend on the relative price of foreign goods

(et + p —

(6)

and the level of foreign output,

y = a8e + a9p — a10p + a11y + fl5

While an increase in the relative price of foreign goods would normally be
expected to increase output, this effect may depend on whether relative price
changes reflect movements in price levels or in the exchange rate.

Since the

exchange rate is determined in auction markets, changes in relative prices
caused by exchange rate movements may not be a good signal of future relative

prices, and thus output may he unresponsive to such changes.

Changes in

relative prices caused by price level movements should, since prices are

—7--

determined

in contract markets, be a better signal of future relative prices,

and thus output should be responsive to these changes.

For this reason, we

place separate coefficients on the three terms comprising relative prices. The

sign of a8 is ambiguous: a9 and a10 are assumed to be positive. As with the
current account, the effect of an increase in foreign income on domestic output
is ambiguous.

of constraints. We allow the money supply to respond to the stock of foreign

assets to incorporate the possibility that the monetary authorities will

balance. It is assumed that a15 > 0.

The Rational Expectations Solution

3.

We now proceed to solve the model and consider the implications of the
rational expectations assumption.

Most research on exchange rate dynamics,

cited above, incorporates either slow price or slow asset adjustment, but not
both.

This produces models with two first order differential (or difference)

equations, involving one predetermined and one non—predetermined variable, which

can always be solved analytically.

Incorporating slow price and slow asset

adjustment produces a third order system, which in general cannot be solved
analytically. Buiter and Miller (1983) use numerical simulation while Eaton and

Turnovsky (1983) are able to determine the signs of the characteristic roots,

although not their values.

The essential difference between Eaton and

Turnovsky's paper and ours is that, following Dornbusch (1976), they assume that
7

prices adjust in response to the relative price of foreign and domestic goods.
Although Mussa's rule, which we adopt, is seemingly more complicated, it allows

us to determine the characteristic roots exactly. While this is necessary for
estimation, the theoretical implications of the two models are very similar.

The first step towards a solution is to write the structural equations in

the form of five first order stochastic difference equations. Using (2), (3),
(6), and (7), the portfolio balance equation (1) can be written,

The equations for the exogenous variables (8) are unchanged.

A rational expectations solution for the model involves finding distri—

technique used is a multivariate version of the method of undetermined
coefficients used by Muth (1961) and described in detail by Taylor (1985). It

involves representing the variables in general infinite moving average form,
substituting these general forms into the structural equations, and then solving
the resultant identities for the coefficients.

The representations of all of the variables incorporate current disturbances.
The exchange rate is determined in asset markets and is assumed to reflect all

will also be stable.

If

> 1, the usual assumption, that the conditionally expected time paths of the

variables be stable, is imposed by setting C1, the coefficient of the unstable

root in (15), equal to zero.

This allows all of the il's to be uniquely

9

determined.

There is no reason, however, to presume that A1 > 1 in this model.

If

< 1, the requirement that the conditionally expected time paths of the
variables be stable does not imply any additional conditions, and thus does not

provide a unique solution. Procedures for achieving a unique solution have been

suggested by Taylor (1977) and McCallum (1983). The first part of McCallum's

procedure is to require that a minimal set of state variables be employed in
agents forecasting rules.

This can be implemented by setting either C1 or C2

equal to zero, and thus does not yield a unique solution. The second part of

his procedure is to require that the solution be valid for all admissable
parameter values.

Consider the case where the determinant of Q1 is equal to

zero. Then x =

so that A1 =

+ 3 + 12 while A = 0.

The minimal set of

state variables criterion implies that zero is the appropriate root in this
case, thus it is necessary to set C1

0, and a unique solution can be derived.

Taylor's procedure provides the same answer.

If a solution to the model is

defined as setting either C1 or C2 equal to zero, then Taylor's condition, that
the asymptotic variance of the variables be minimized, is implemented by setting

C1, the coefficient on the largest of the two roots, equal to zero.

It should

be noted that these two procedures do not always coincide. In particular, both

McCallum (1983) and Taylor (1985) discuss how they differ when applied to
Taylor's (1977) model.

—14—

An alternative method for estimating models of this type has been proposed
by Chow (1983). He suggests that, instead of constraining the model to achieve
a unique solution, the parameter C1 be estimated along with the other parameters

of the model. Thus the "solution" of the model will be based on whatever value

of C1 maximizes the likelihood function.

Evans and Honkapohja (1984) also

discuss estimators of this type.

We conclude
this

model.

this section by considering the causes of non—uniqueness in

One possible factor is if a depreciation of the exchange rate

reduces output (a8 < 0). Calvo (1983) considers the implications of this for
non—uniqueness. A second factor that operates through its effect on domestic
output is if an increase in the domestic price level reduces domestic output

(a10 > 0), which is the expected case.

Monetary policy which accommodates

either exchange rate and/or domestic price movements (a12 and/or a13 > 0) also

contributes towards non—uniqueness. This is also plausible. It can be produced

by, for example, monetary policy which accommodates the consumer price index.
Thus non—uniqueness of the rational expectations solution can be the result of
reasonable parameter values.

Estimation of the Model

We now examine the extent to which the model developed above can explain

phenomena in the current flexible exchange rate period.

The cross equation

restrictions imposed by the theory constrain the exchange rate, stock of foreign

assets, and price level to follow a unique path after a shock, Estimation of
the model subject to these constraints provides a joint test of the portfolio

—15—

balance approach with slow price adjustment arid the rational expectations
as sunip t ion.

The model is estimated for Japan, using quarterly data from 1973 (II) to
1983 (IV).

The various configurations of the exchange rate and the current

account experienced by Japan in the 1970's and the 1980's seem to be amenable to

explanation by the portfolio balance approach.

Japan also appears to fit the

model's assumptions (that foreign residents do not hold domestic assets and that

In addition, the assumption that

assets do not pay interest makes estimation of the model inappropriate for
countries where high capital mobility makes interest rate differentials an
important determinant of exchange rates.

The exchange rates used are weighted average exchange rates, with the
weights derived from the International Monetary Fund's Multilateral Exchange
Rate Model (MERN).

The weights represent the effect on the country's trade

balance (calculated from the MERN) of a 1 percent change in the value of each
foreign currency in terms of the home currency. The data for stocks of foreign

assets are computed by taking a base figure for the middle of the period and
then adding quarterly current account balances forwards and backwards. To the
extent that current account balances cannot be exactly identified with changes
in domestic holdings of foreign assets, the model will account for the former at

the expense of the latter.

The price level used is the GNP deflator, real

income is real GNP, and the money supply is Ml.

Foreign variables are

constructed by taking weighted averages, with the weights corresponding to the

—16—

weights.

The share of domestic goods in domestic consumption for Japan

(b1) is .86, while the share of domestic assets in domestic wealth is .76.

To

remove nonstationarity in the variables, all data (after taking logarithms) are

Estimation of the model requires deriving the reduced form, which in turn
necessitates making some assumptions about the structure of the error terms. We

This produces a first order autoregressive fourth order

Assuming, as above, that expectations are determined

rationally and solving by the method of undetermined coefficients, the reduced
form of (8)—(11) is derived,

where z =

and

A and B are 5x5 matrices. The elements of A and B are non—linear combinations

of the ES's, s, and T's (which in turn are combinations of the a's), and the
a's,

The V's are combinations of the 's, written so as to make the zero lag

coefficient matrix the identity matrix. The constraints on the parameters are
generated by the form of the structural equations, the assumption of rational
expectations, and the imposition of the uniqueness conditions.

—17-

The model to be estimated consists of equations (6), (7), and (16). These

are estimated jointly in accordance with the Lucas critique. We make the same

assumptions with regard to the structure of the disturbance terms for output
and the money supply

as we do for the others.

(a6 is the serial

correlation term for output, a7 for the money supply.) There are 98 constrained

parameters in the complete model, 14 autoregressive, 76 moving average, and 8
simultaneous, which are combinations of 24 fundamental parameters, 17 structural
(a's) and 7 serial correlation (a's).

Using maximum likelihood techniques, we can estimate the structural
coefficients, the serial correlation coefficients, and the covariance matrix of

the shocks. The reduced form (16) is a vector ARMA (1,4) model with nonlinear

constraints on the parameters. Under the assumption that

is a multivariate

normal vector with EVtVt_ = 2, maximum likelihood estimates (conditional on the

initial disturbances being set to zero) under the restrictions imposed by the
model are obtained by maximizing,

L() = (211)_T -T/2 exp(-1/2

minimization routines can he used to find the minimum even though the
determinant is a highly nonlinear function of the parameters. The technique

—18-

The maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters are given in Table 1
along with their asymptotic "t—ratios', the ratio of these coefficients to their
standard errors computed from the inverse of the second derivative matrix of the

likelihood function. The results of the estimation are very successful. Most

of the structural coefficients have the expected sign, are of reasonable
magnitude, and are significant.

In the portfolio balance equation, the

coefficients on income (a1), wealth (a2), and the expected rate of depreciation

(a3) are all positive, plausible, and significant.

For the current account

equation, the coefficient on domestic income (a4) is positive and insignificant,

while for foreign income (a5) it is negative and insignificant. Both of these
parameters, however, are theoretically ambiguous.

The coefficient on wealth

(a6) is, as expected, positive and significant.

Mussa's price adjustment

equation appears to fit well, with the coefficient on the difference between
equilibrium and actual prices (a7) positive and significant.

Foreign (a9) and domestic (a10) prices have the expected affects on
domestic output, with both coefficients positive and a10 significant.

The

coefficient on the exchange rate (a8) is negative and significant, while foreign

output (a11) has no affect on domestic output at all.

The money supply is

accommodative with respect to the exchange rate (a12), the domestic price level

(a13), the foreign price level (a14), and the stock of foreign assets (a15),
with all four coefficients being positive and significant. The signs of these

coefficients are not consistent with the hypothesis that the money supply
responds to the real exchange rate.

While the signs are consistent with the

money supply accommodating the consumer price index, the magnitudes are not.

—19—

The response of the money supply to the exchange rate and the stock of foreign
assets indicates that intervention is important.

The autoregressive parameter on foreign prices (a16) is positive and
significant while the coefficient for foreign output (a17) is positive and
insignificant.

Only the serial correlation coefficient for the exchange rate

(a1) is positive while only the coefficients for domestic (a3) and foreign (ct4)

prices are significant.

In summary, the estimated values of all of the

coefficients for which the theory predicts a determinate sign are of that sign,
15

are significant, and are plausible.

We now examine the parameter values implied by the estimates, which are
also given in Table 1. Both

and

and C1, the coefficient

of X1, is set to zero by the arguments of McCallum and Taylor described above to

provide a unique solution.

All four possible factors contribute to the

A depreciation of the exchange rate and an increase in the

domestic price level both reduce domestic output, while monetary policy is
accommodative with respect to both the exchange rate and the domestic price
level.

Estimates of the model using Chow's technique are presented in Table 2.
The value of C1 is —.19 (—1.54) which, while not significant, has a large enough
value and a small enough standard error so that the possibility that C1 does not

equal zero should be taken seriously.

The structural parameters, however, do

not change very much and the parameter values implied by the estimates (the 6's,
l's, i's, and A's) are very similar. In summary, the less restrictive estimates

using Chow's technique indicate that the constraints imposed above to achieve a
unique solution are not seriously at odds with the data.

—20—

One illustrative method of examining the results of the estimation is to
consider the moving average representations for the constrained model.

These

give the response over time of the exchange rate, stock of foreign assets, and

domestic price level to disturbances of the exchange rate, stock of foreign
assets, domestic price level, foreign price level, and foreign output, and are

presented in Table 3.

The representations for the less constrained model

(Chow's method) are very similar and are not presented. These representations
are conditional on the assumption that the correlations between the disturbances

are zero, so that an innovation in one variable can be considered independently

of movements in the others. While some of the correlations are low, some are
16

high enough to suggest that these representations be interpreted with caution.

Sims (1979), Sargent (1978) and Taylor (1980) have used the moving average
representation in other contexts.

A disturbance that depreciates the exchange rate causes a deficit.

Over

increases slightly.

The domestic price level

A surplus shock to the current account produces

appreciation of the exchange rate and a small decrease in the domestic price
level.

The responses to current account and to exchange rate shocks are of

comparable magnitude. An increase in the domestic price level depreciates the
exchange 'rate and causes cycles of current account surplus and deficits.

An

increase in the foreign price level first causes depreciation and deficits, but

the deficits continue after the depreciation is reversed.

Shocks to foreign

output do not have strong affects.

The correlation between the exchange rate

and the current account is positive (deficits associated with depreciation and

vice versa) in response to shocks of the exchange rate and stock of foreign

assets, and mixed in response to shocks of the domestic and foreign price
levels.

Conclusions

This paper has shown that, by incorporating rational

expectations

explicitly into the portfolio balance framework, a model of an open economy can

he constructed that is capable of accounting for the dynamics of the exchange

rate and the current account.

By deriving the cross equation constraints

implied by the rational expectations solution and then estimating the model
subject to these constraints, the paper provides a rigorous joint test of the
portfolio balance approach and the rational expectations assumption.

The estimation results for Japan are quite successful.

They accord well

with the theory and are capable of explaining various patterns of correlation
between the exchange rate and the current account.

One noteworthy result is

that the usual stability condition does not provide a unique solution to the
model. Several methods for resolving this problem are implemented and compared.

The results provide strong econometric evidence of the

importance of

simultaneous determination of the exchange rate, the price level, the current
account, and expectations in open economy macroeconomic models.

1. The assumption that foreigners hold only the foreign asset is common in
portfolio balance models.

If

relaxed, a two—country model would be needed.

If, in that context, the assumption were made that each country's residents

preferred their own asset, the results would be similar to the present
model.

2. Allowing foreign assets to pay an exogenously determined rate of interest,

as in Dornbusch and Fischer (1980), does not affect the theoretical
results.

Since the model contains no interest bearing assets, it can be

considered a currency substitution model in the sense used by Calvo and

Rodriguez (1977). We call it a portfolio balance model becuase the term
"currency substitution" has come to imply trade in currencies in addition
to other assets.

It is assumed that the n's are not contemporaneously correlated.

4. This log—linear approximation for wealth has been used by Driskill (1980)
and by Eaton and Turnovsky (1983).

5. An alternative specification would be to have domestic income and wealth
denominated in terms of foreign currency.

The model with this equation

cannot be distinguished, either theoretically or empirically, from the
specification in the text.

It is not possible to have both the current

account and domestic output (specified below) depend on relative prices and

still econometrically identify the parameters.

6. Mussa argues that his formulation has a better microec000mic rationale and
more sensible steady state properties than Dornbusch's.

7. Dornbusch assumes that prices adjust in response to excess demand in the
goods market.

tn his model, although not in Eaton and Turnovsky's nor in

ours, that is equivalent to having prices adjust in response to the
relative price of foreign and domestic goods.

8. If the disturbances were modeled as moving average processes, equation (13)

would contain terms up to the order of the moving average. Equation (14)
would begin with the next term and the remainder of the solution, including
the characteristic roots and the uniqueness criteria, would be unchanged.

9. This criterion is also known as the "no speculative bubbles" or "finite
variance" condition.

10. While it is certainly not true that no Japanese currency is held by
foreigners, the yen is not an international currency in the sense that the

dollar or sterling is.

Relaxing this assumption is discussed in

footnote 1.

11. The data is taken from International Financial Statistics.

All data is

seasonally adjusted except for the exchange rate (which does not exhibit a

strong seasonal pattern).

The countries used to construct the foreign

variables (weights in parentheses) are:

Canada (.04), France (10),

Germany (.16), Italy (.05), United Kingdom (.05), and United States (.60).

12. These weights are averages oier

the

sample period.

Theoretically, b1

should represent the share of importable goods in domestic consumption,

rather than imported goods, and should therefore be estimated.

It is

impossible, however, to econometrically identify the parameters in equation
(1) if h1 is also estimated.

13. In addition, the constants were removed from the first—differenced data so
that the variables would have zero means. We also estimated the model with

the data detrended by regression on a constant, linear time tread, and
trend squared.

The results of this estimation indicated that the

detrending was not sufficient to remove nonstationarity for the exchange
rate.

14. The disturbances need to be written as finite order moving averages for the

model to be estimated. We generate these from first order autoregressive
processes in order to limit the number of parameters to be estimated. The
moving average representation for u1 is truncated one order lower than the

others so as not to impose arbitrary zero restrictions on u24, ...,

u54.

The ARMA (1,4) model was chosen because it eliminated most of the serial
correlation among the residuals.

15. While it would be desirable to test the cross equation restrictions by

using a likelihood ratio test, the lack of degrees of freedom in the
unrestricted system makes this impossible.
