Understanding the Correlation between Alzheimer’s Disease Polygenic Risk, Wealth, and
the Composition of Wealth Holdings
Su H. Shin, Dean R. Lillard, and Jay Bhattacharya
NBER Working Paper No. 25526
February 2019
JEL No. D1,D8,I12
ABSTRACT
We investigate how the genetic risk of developing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) relates to saving
behavior. Using nationally representative data from the 1992-2014 Health and Retirement Study
(HRS), we find that genetic predisposition for AD correlates with, but is not causally related to
older individuals’ wealth holdings. People with higher Alzheimer’s Disease polygenic risk score
(PGS) hold roughly 9 percent more wealth in CDs (hands-off assets) and around 11 percent, 15
percent, and 7 percent less wealth in stocks, IRAs, and other financial assets (hands-on assets)
respectively. We explore three hypotheses that could explain these correlations. We hypothesize
that people with high risk of AD choose different portfolios because: (i) they know their
polygenic risk of developing Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementia, (ii) they have lower
cognitive capacity, and (iii) the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) process that generated
the Alzheimer’s Disease PGS failed to fully account for the aging process. Our extended model
results do not support the first two hypotheses. Consistent with the third hypothesis, the
interaction between age and the Alzheimer’s Disease PGS explains the correlation between
genetic traits and asset holdings.

I. Introduction
We explore whether people save differently when they have a greater or smaller polygenic risk
of developing Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We take advantage of developments in genetics that
have opened up new opportunities for social scientists to better understand and explain how
people manage life before ADRD develops. Through large-scale genome-wide association
studies (GWAS), researchers have discovered a number of genetic variants (single nucleotide
polymorphisms, or SNPs) that exhibit credible and robust associations with the onset of
Alzheimer’s Disease (Lambert et al. 2013). These genetic markers – present from birth – predict
early onset of AD, even before any overt signs of the condition are observable.
The availability of such data has shifted researchers’ focus away from the previous
method that relied on twin studies. That literature found that genetic traits explain a significant
portion of observed variation in active portfolio management (Cesarini et al. 2010), stock market
participation and asset allocation (Barnea, Cronqvist, and Siegel 2010), and behavioral biases in
investment (Cronqvist and Siegel 2014). The major shortcoming of those studies is that their
conclusions may not extend to the non-twin population. With polygenic scores, researchers can
identify particular genetic markers associated with various financial decision and explore
possible pathways through which such correlations might arise in the general population.
There are good reasons to take advantage of the new polygenic data that are correlated
with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (hereafter ADRD). The Baby Boomers
generation is entering into an age range at which people develop ADRD at high rates. Further, a
growing number of social scientists have begun to use genetic data to explain social and
economic behavior. There is a tendency to assume that genetic risk scores represent random
shocks that can be exploited to explain social and economic outcomes. We explore the validity of
this assumption.
We study differences in the amount and type of financial assets people hold. 1 We first
show that a person's Alzheimer’s Disease polygenic score (PGS) is statistically correlated with
(the log of) the value of assets a person holds in six separate asset categories. These include:
Certificates of Deposit (CDs), government savings bonds, and treasury bills; publicly traded
stocks and stocks held in mutual funds or investment trusts; Individual Retirement Accounts and
1

We find no correlation between Alzheimer’s Disease polygenic risk score and net worth, housing assets and
nonfinancial assets. Results are available upon request.

2

Keogh accounts (IRAs); and other financial assets. We characterize assets in these categories
according to how actively an investor must manage them. To realize maximum returns available
in each category, CD and government-issued securities category require less active management,
while stocks and the IRAs require more active management (that is more frequent and
complicated portfolio allocation decisions). We label these categories as “hands-off” and “handson” assets respectively. Using data from the 1992-2014 Health and Retirement Study (HRS), we
find that people with higher AD polygenic risk hold 9 percent more wealth in “hands-off” assets
and around 11 percent, 15 percent, and 7 percent less wealth in “hands-on” assets (see Table 3).
We test three hypotheses that might explain these observed correlations. We hypothesize
that persons with a different PGS save/allocate wealth in different ways because…
H1: …they know their polygenic risk of developing ADRD;
H2: …they have different levels of cognitive capacity (and their PGS for general
cognition is correlated with the Alzheimer’s Disease PGS);
H3: …the GWAS process that generated the Alzheimer’s Disease PGS fails to
fully account for the aging process.
We motivate H1 by the idea that foreknowledge of AD risk will alter optimal allocation
of investments since a positive AD PGS increases the risk of higher health care and caregiving
needs late in life, and reduces expected healthy life years. There is evidence, for instance, that
people alter their long run financial plans in response to pertinent new information (Goda,
Manchester, and Sojourner 2014; Liebman and Luttmer 2015; Mastrobuoni 2011). Information
affects behavior across generations. Among a sample of young Germans, initially unwilling to
purchase long-term care insurance for their parents, 30 percent became willing to buy after they
were informed of the percentage of old individuals who are currently receiving care; and the
means of monthly nursing home costs; length of nursing home stay; and weekly hours of
informal caregiving (Zhou-Richter, Browne, and Grundl 2010). Information about at least one of
family members’ diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease may affect people’s retirement planning
decisions. Using sample collected from the University of Utah’s Retirement Planning Survey,
researchers find that individuals who had a parental history of Alzheimer’s Disease are 86
percent more likely to have consulted with a financial advisor and 40 percent less likely to plan
to retire before age 65 (Zick, Smith, and Mayer 2016). Information about individuals’ genetic
risk of developing Alzheimer’s Disease may shift demand for long-term care insurance.
3

Participants of the Risk Evaluation and Education for Alzheimer’s Disease (REVEAL) Study
(who were qualified for the program only if they have at least one parent suffering from the
disease) were more likely to purchase long-term care insurance when they receive information
that they have at least one e4 trait from an APOE test compared to those who discovered to have
two e3 traits (Talyor Jr. et al. 2010) and those who did not receive any information (Zick et al.
2005). Thus, if a person knows (or learns) that she faces a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s
Disease, she may either hire an agent or allocate more savings to the “hands-off” asset category.
To test the first hypothesis we use data on whether a person knows that her parents or her
spouse's parents currently have or ever had a memory-related disease.
We motivate H2 by theory and evidence which suggests that cognitive ability may affect
an individuals’ decision about how much to earn, save, and allocate savings. Extant literature has
documented the relation between cognitive ability and behavioral biases (Benjamin, Brown, and
Shaprio 2013; Dohmen et al. 2010; Frederick 2005), and financial decisions and outcomes
(Agarwal and Mazumder 2013; Christelis, Jappelli, and Padual 2010; Grinblatt, Keloharju, and
Linnainmaa 2011; McArdle, Smith, and Willis 2009). Individuals with better cognitive ability
make fewer mistakes when they invest (Agarwal and Mazumder 2013), are more likely to hold
any stocks (Christelis et al. 2010; Cole, Paulson, and Shastry 2014; Grinblatt et al. 2011),
allocate more assets in stocks (Browning and Finke 2015), and earn greater risk-adjusted returns
(Grinblatt, Keloharju, and Linnainmaa 2012).
Evidence also suggests that differences in genetic factors associated with educational
attainment explain differences in wealth and financial behavior. Barth, Papageorge and Thom
(2017) find that, after controlling for education, labor market earnings, and other factors, retired
persons whose educational attainment PGS is one standard deviation higher than the mean
education PGS hold 23 percent more wealth than those with the average education PGS. They
also show that people with different educational attainment PGS take financial and investment
decisions that statistically differ from each other. They find that people with a higher education
PGS are more likely to own stocks, know more basics of financial investing, know more about
macroeconomics events and stock market returns, and adopt a longer financial planning horizon.
Thus, the AD PGS may simply capture variation in other genetic polygenic scores known
to be associated with wealth. GWAS identified thirteen SNPs to be associated with
neuropsychiatric phenotypes (Davies et al. 2015). If some of these SNPs also lie along the causal
4

pathway that leads to AD or otherwise promotes its ultimate occurrence, then our observed
correlation between the AD PGS and portfolio allocation may be due to differences in cognitive
ability or other neuropsychiatric phenotypes, rather than due to AD risk itself. To test the second
hypothesis we use general cognition PGS and total cognition scores of the respondent and
spouse and the interaction of those scores with the AD PGS.
Our third hypothesis explores an implicit assumption – that people do not know their
Alzheimer’s Disease PGS. This assumption is equivalent to assuming that the Alzheimer’s PGS
is randomly distributed across people and, more specifically, over people of different ages. We
conjecture that, as people advance to old age, they are able to (more precisely) estimate their risk
of developing ADRD. When people are younger, there is more variance in the signals of
advancing ADRD so some people may choose to ignore the signals. As a person learns that she
will grow more forgetful, she will rationally allocate a greater share of her savings into financial
instruments that require less active management. 2 Therefore, as ADRD develops, it will become
increasingly apparent that she will develop ADRD. If the GWAS fails to incorporate this agespecific learning process then the AD PGS will not be orthogonal with age. To test this
hypothesis, we add to the model the interaction between an individual’s AD PGS and his/her
age.
Our evidence supports the third hypothesis. Once one accounts for the correlation
between age and the AD PGS, the Alzheimer’s Disease PGS is uncorrelated with amount of
assets a person holds in every category. The results have two implications. First, researchers
should think carefully before they assume since an individual’s genetic endowment (e.g.
polygenic risk score) is outside the control of the individual; i.e. that the PGS can be treated as if
were randomly assigned in an analysis of the causal pathway between genotype and a complex
outcome that depends on behavior (e.g. asset allocation). Second, when people save, they clearly
look forward. Our results are consistent with the idea that when people save in different asset
categories, they anticipate that they may grow forgetful or incapable of managing their assets.
The results also suggest that consumer welfare might be improved if people took advantage of

2

Our approach is slightly different from that of Korniotis and Kumar (2011), who hypothesized that aging impacts
investment behavior through the accumulation of greater investment knowledge from experience but also through
cognitive deterioration.

5

the recently available genetic tests for the genetic factors associated with Alzheimer’s Disease,
even though no effective medical intervention is available to treat or prevent AD (Galvin 2017).
We next briefly motivate the study of wealth allocation across people with different
genetic risks of developing Alzheimer’s Disease. In Section III, we describe the data and
variables we construct. In section IV, we specify our baseline and extended asset holding
models. In the extended models we add variables that are potentially correlated with the AD PGS
and we interact them with the AD PGS. We present results in Section V. In section VI we report
results from models that explore even more competing explanations. Section VII concludes.
II. Motivation
There are good reasons to study whether and how social and economic behavior varies
systematically with polygenic risk of various diseases or behaviors in general and with respect to
ADRD in particular. Individuals, their families, and Federal and state governments spend quite a
bit of money to provide informal and formal care for people with ADRD. These expenditures
will grow as the population of people with ADRD grows.
The rightward shift of the demographic bulge implies that the absolute number of older
adults with ADRD is increasing. Best available estimates suggest that, in 2017, 5.5 million U.S.
residents suffered from ADRD (estimates suggest that 10 percent of Americans age 65 or older
suffer from ADRD) (Alzheimer’s Association 2017). Because ADRD tends to be
underdiagnosed and underreported, researchers have likely underestimated how many Americans
suffer or will suffer with ADRD. The Alzheimer’s Association (2017) also projects that, by
2025, the number of people 65 and older with ADRD will increase to 7.1 million. This figure
represents about a 35 percent increase in the 2017 ADRD population.
The federal government spends relatively more, through Medicare and Medicaid, on
people with ADRD versus those without ADRD. In 2016, Medicare spent three times as much to
provide health care for ADRD victims than similarly aged beneficiaries without ADRD ($23,497
vs $7,223 respectively) (Alzheimer’s Association 2016). In 2016, average annual Medicaid
payments for ADRD victims were 23 times larger than the average payment for those without
ADRD ($8,182 versus $349 respectively) (Alzheimer’s Association 2016).

6

Despite this government spending, ADRD victims, families and friends pay substantial
economic, social, emotional and psychological costs. ADRD makes it increasingly difficult for
victims to perform normal life activities as it becomes increasingly difficult to follow routines or
remember tasks they need to perform in daily activities. The loss of normal routines imposes
psychic and emotional costs that may include the trauma involved in leaving one’s home to enter
a less personalized institutional care facility. Such moves degrade quality of life. Although
victims may delay this reduction in quality of life, they do so either by paying directly for a
person to provide them with long-term care (LTC) or by getting LTC from a family member.
Long-term care is not cheap. In 2017, the median rates for a semi-private room in a
nursing home and for assisted-living facilities were $7,148 per month and $3,750 per month
(Genworth 2017). ADRD victims may pay less out-of-pocket for long-term care from family
members but they and family members still pay both money and non-monetary costs.
Researchers estimate that, in 2016, informal caregivers devoted 18.2 billion hours without pay to
care for ADRD victims. Using a median wage as an estimate of the cost of each hour, this time
represents an estimated economic value of $230.1 billion (Wolff et al. 2016).
Further, recent cohorts of adult children of ADRD victims face higher costs to provide
informal care because they have fewer siblings with whom to share the burden and because of
competing demands for their time. Higher divorce rates in younger cohorts implies that a given
adult child is more likely to be a single parent. Even if a person is married, women now routinely
participate in the labor market so both partners have less time available to provide care (and there
is less flexibility about when that time falls in the day). People who choose to provide informal
care likely suffer greater stress as they juggle the competing demands.
Finally, end-of-life health care costs and the costs of LTC for ADRD victims
significantly exceed costs of people with other conditions. Kelley et al. (2015) estimate that total
end-of-life and LTC costs in the last 5 years of life were $341,651 per person for ADRD victims
and $217,820 per person for non-ADRD victims.
The availability of genetic tests for ADRD has created a dilemma for policy makers and
for clinicians providing advice to patients. Genetic tests for ADRD do not help clinicians
because there is no effective treatment for ADRD. Therefore, it is irrelevant to a clinician if
he/she knows whether a person is likely to develop ADRD. If he/she knows, the recommended
7

treatment does not change. On the other hand, genetic tests may improve individual and social
welfare because a positive ADRD screen might induce patients to alter their behavior in welfareenhancing ways. For example, on learning one’s ADRD risk, a person may start saving earlier to
finance the costs of the care he/she will want later in life. The private savings improves social
welfare because it reduces the amount governments need to tax. Finally, some evidence suggests
that people adopt more future oriented health behaviors (less smoking, drinking, more exercise)
when they have a clearer idea of their ADRD risk. To the extent these behaviors yield higher
lifetime utility, private welfare improves.
III. Data
We use data from the 1992-2014 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). The HRS is
a biennial longitudinal panel survey that collects a rich set of information about American adults
age 50 and older and their spouses. The information includes individuals’ demographics,
physical and mental health status, disability, financial status such as income, net worth, and
housing, insurance, work history and current employment status, retirement status and planning,
and family structure (Servais 2004).
Dependent variables
The HRS collects detailed information on household financial assets. We use data from
the RAND HRS wealth file. That file includes household level data on any money or assets held
in stocks (publicly held corporations, mutual funds, or investment trusts), cash-equivalent
(checking, savings, and money market accounts), retirement accounts (Individual Retirement
Account (IRA), Keogh account), certificates of deposit (CDs) (government savings bonds, or
treasury bills), bonds (corporate, municipal, government, foreign bonds, or any bond funds), and
other financial assets (any other savings or other assets such as jewelry, money owed, a
collection for investment purposes, rights in a trust or estate, or an annuity). The data measure
the value of each asset. We use the all-items consumer price index to express all values in 2014
dollars.
Polygenic scores for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias and General Cognition
In 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012 the HRS collected saliva samples from respondents and
their spouses in randomly selected households (Ware, Schmitz, and Faul 2018). The HRS
8

constructed polygenic risk scores (PGSs) for a large set of phenotypes. To do this, they used a
genome-wide association study (GWAS) in which they correlated genetic variants in individuals
with a given trait (Faul and Smith 2017). Ware et al. (2018) publish detailed descriptions on how
the HRS generated polygenic scores for various traits such as educational attainment, height,
Body Mass Index, blood pressure, smoking initiation, subjective wellbeing, depressive
symptoms, etc. The HRS provides scores including all available SNPs that overlap between the
GWAS and the HRS genetic data. The PGSs consist of the weighted sum of the genotype (the
number of reference alleles for individuals at each SNP – zero, one, or two). The HRS chose
weights of the odds ratio or beta estimates corresponding to the phenotype of interest obtained
from GWAS.
Our primary independent variable is the PGS for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related
Dementias. The HRS’s most recent version of the data includes two polygenic scores for
Alzheimer’s Disease; one version includes the two SNP variants known to be associated with
apolipoprotein E (APOE) status (rs7412, and rs429358); the other version of the AD PGS omits
those two variants. Both scores include 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated
with Alzheimer’s Disease. Because the two excluded SNPs account for very little of the overall
correlation with AD, the two PGSs are almost perfectly correlated (r=0.99992) (Ware et al.
2018). In our main analyses, figure and tables, we report the estimates from models using
Alzheimer’s Disease PGS that includes the ApoE status variants. We report results from models
that use the PGS without the ApoE status variants in appendix Tables A12-A18. The results from
the two measures are virtually identical.
Figure 1 plots the kernel density estimates for the Alzheimer’s Disease PGS that includes
the ApoE status variants. The distribution of the Alzheimer’s Disease PGS variables is
approximately normal. As is typical, we normalize the Alzheimer’s Disease PGS variable, so that
the coefficient on the PGS in multivariate regressions represents the percentage change in the
asset of interest in response to a one standard deviation change in the Alzheimer’s Disease PGS.
The HRS created the PGS for general cognition based on thirteen SNPs in three separate
regions associated with general cognitive function phenotypes (Davies et al. 2015). The HRS
used the weights provided by the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic
Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium and adjusted for age, sex, population stratification, and
9

cohort-specific covariates such as familiar relationship (Ware et al. 2018). The PGS for general
cognition is also standardized with mean of zero and standard deviation of one.
To explore mechanisms, we draw respondent’s and his/her spouse’s parents’ history of
memory disease/problems, scores from HRS administered cognition tests, self-reported memory,
tolerance for risk, and financial planning horizon. We estimate models that include these
variables and sometimes their interaction with the AD PGS. We briefly describe them next.
Parental history of memory problems/diagnosis (MRD): The 1998-2008 HRS surveys
asked respondents about their parent’s history of memory problems. HRS only asked the
question of respondents with at least one living parent. HRS asked those respondents whether a
doctor has ever told their mother (father) that she (he) has a memory-related disease. The 20102014 surveys ask respondents if a doctor has ever diagnosed the respondent’s mother and father
with Alzheimer’s or Dementia. We ignore the wording differences and use these data to create a
time-invariant variable that equals one if a respondent had at least one parent who has ever had a
memory-related problem/disease. We create the same dummy variable for his/her spouse. Note
that the respondent’s parent had to be alive to answer the question. We use all of the available
data so we create this indicator for respondents whose parents subsequently died. Respondents
reported that approximately 11 percent of their mothers and 4 percent of their fathers suffered a
memory-related disease/problem.
In Table A10 of the Appendix we investigate whether the Alzheimer’s disease PGS vary
systematically across the sample of respondents (spouses) who had a parent with a history of
memory-related disease. We find that that parental history of memory-related disease is not
statistically significantly related to the degree of genetic risk of developing Alzheimer’s Disease.
Cognition scores: The total cognition score measures memory and knowledge, language, and
orientation skills (Fisher et al. 2017). To construct cognition scores the HRS administers two
word-recall exercises with each respondent and his spouse and a test of a person’s mental status.
The word recall exercises are just what the name implies – respondents read a list of words and
then must recall as many as they can - immediately and after some delay. For the mental status
test respondents must add up a series of 7s, count backwards from 20, and identify who is the
President and/or Vice-President of the United States. Ofstedal, Fisher, and Herzog (2005)
describe these measures in more detail.
10

We use the RAND HRS version of the cognition scores. RAND imputed cognition scores
for people who failed to take the tests. They did not impute values for people who did not
participate at all in a given survey wave or for people whose data were reported by a proxy
respondent. To impute the scores, RAND uses a multivariate regression model that includes
time-invariant baseline demographic characteristics, wave-specific demographics, other timevarying factors associated with cognitive functioning, and past and current wave cognition
scores. Fisher et al. (2017) describe more details of the imputation procedure. In our model of
savings, we standardized the total cognition score variable, setting its mean to zero and standard
deviation to one.
Self-rated memory: The HRS asks respondents, “How would you rate your memory at the
present time? Would you say it excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?” The responses range
from one (excellent) to five (poor). We reverse the scores, so that higher scores indicate better
perception of memory. We standardize the variable so we can interpret the corresponding
coefficient as the effect of a one-standard deviation increase in self-assessed memory.
In Table A11 of the Appendix we examine whether self-rated memory varies
systematically with the two Alzheimer’s disease PGS. In general, we find that that the AD PGS
is statistically significantly and negatively related to the level of self-assessed memory capacity.
Risk tolerance: To measure a respondent’s risk aversion, the HRS asks respondents a set of
income gamble questions. They ask him/her to choose between pairs of jobs where one
guarantee current family income and the other offers a chance to increase income but also carries
the risk of loss of income. The second job would double income with even chances (50-50) or
cut it by X. The income loss scenarios provided in the HRS are: “10 percent, 20 percent, a third,
half, and 75 percent.” HRS asked the questions in only five survey waves (1992 and 1998-2006).
We create a dummy variable of whether a respondent is risk averse by coding the variable as one
if he/she choose to take a job that guarantees current income over the second job that may double
income or cut it by 10 percent and as zero otherwise. Approximately 61 percent and 62 percent
of the respondents and spouses exhibit risk averse preferences (Table 1). When risk aversion data
were missing but available in the previous wave, we use those data.
Planning horizon: Another possible mechanism that might explain the correlation between the
Alzheimer’s Disease PGS and savings is the planning horizon. If a person with high polygenic
11

risk of developing Alzheimer’s Disease has a systematically shorter or longer time horizon, it
may affect his/her portfolio allocation. In order to measure a person’s financial planning horizon,
the HRS asks the question, “In planning your family’s saving and spending, which time period is
more important to you?” The percent of the respondents and spouses in the sample reporting in
each category were, respectively: “next few months (10.7 & 11.3),” “next year (12.0 & 12.1),”
“next few years (29.6 & 29.5),” “next 5-10 years (35.9 & 34.9),” and “longer than 10 years”
(11.9 & 12.3).
Sample selection
Following the literature, we restrict our sample to HRS respondents who are from
European ancestry because the sample researchers used to derive the SNP weights was almost
exclusively of European ancestry. It is well-known that when one generates PGS for individuals
from other ancestry groups, the PGS predict poorly (sometimes absurdly) (Martin et al. 2017;
Ware et al. 2018). We further restrict our sample to couples with non-missing values on genetic,
age, education, health status, medical conditions, difficulties with performing activities of daily
livings (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily livings (IADLs), self-rated memory,
employment status, and number of years of work of respondents and spouses, number of living
children, household income, and financial assets. Our analytic sample includes 8,787 individuals
(45,245 person-year observations).
Table 1 presents summary statistics on the sample’s basic characteristics. Because we
include both respondents and spouses in our analyses, summary statistics on household
characteristics of respondent and spouses are almost identical. The majority of our sample earned
at least a high school degree (89%), had at least good health (83%), and was either retired or not
working (69%). The mean age of our average sample member was 66. The average respondent
worked for 36 years. The average total cognition scores of the respondents and spouses are 23.36
(S.D.= 3.60) and 23.00 (S.D.= 4.06, respectively.
Table 2 shows the mean, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of total financial assets
and each financial instruments. The mean value (2014$) of assets held in financial assets, stocks,
cash equivalent, IRAs, CDs, bonds, other financial assets is $350,390, $119,446, $42,734,
$120,755, $25,115, $19,278, and $23,063, respectively. Unsurprisingly, the distribution of each
type of assets is highly skewed. The median household holds much less of each asset. In these
12

same asset categories, the median household holds $118,565, $0, $12,530, $16,496, $0, $0, and
$0, respectively. For some financial instruments, ownership is less common (e.g., only 11
percent of individuals own bonds). A majority of our sample holds at least one type of financial
asset (96.79%) and cash-equivalents (93.36%).
IV. Empirical model
We adopt a simple method. We first specify a model of each household’s (log) assets of
several different types. These include all financial assets, stocks, cash, IRAs, CDs, bonds, and
other financial assets. Each model includes the respondent’s and his/her spouse’s Alzheimer’s
Disease PGS and a set of standard control variables as follows:
log(𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) = 𝛼𝛼0 + 𝛼𝛼1 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (1)

𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 denotes Alzheimer’s Disease PGS with ApoE status variants. 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 includes: the

first ten principal components of the genetic data, 3 age, age-squared, education, self-reported

health status, number of medical conditions diagnosed by a doctor, number of difficulties with
performing ADLs and IALDs, self-rated memory, employment status, birth cohort, and total
number of years worked of both respondents and spouses, household income, number of living
children, and year dummies. We control for spouses’ characteristics because the HRS collects
detailed information about asset holdings at the household-level rather than individual-level. We
use random-effect regression models for all specifications, and cluster standard errors by
households. As robustness tests, we also estimate the baseline models (1) using random-effect
tobit models, and the significance of the main variables do not change. We report the results in
Table A12A and A12B in Appendix. Unless otherwise indicated, we always include the same set
of control variables.
We then extend the models to explore possible ways the correlations arise. These include
the potential that the AD PGS captures variation from omitted variables. In separate models we
add the reference person and his spouse’s: 1) parents memory problem indicator (Table 4); 2)
general cognition PGS and total cognition scores (Table 5); 3) AD PGS interacted with age

Researchers recommended controlling for the ten principal components of the genetic data to account for a
potential association between genetic factors and ancestry groups and population stratification in GWAS (Price et
al., 2006; Benjamin et al., 2012; Barth et al., 2017).

(Table 6); 4) self-rated memory (Table 7); 5) risk aversion (Table 8); and 6) financial planning
horizon (Table 9). Generically these models take the form:
log(𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) = 𝛼𝛼0 + 𝛼𝛼1 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 + 𝛼𝛼2 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 + 𝛼𝛼3 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (2)

where 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 is the potentially omitted variable. We add the interaction between 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 and the

respondent’s (spouse’s) AD PGS for all but the risk aversion and financial planning horizon
variables. We do not interact those variables with the AD PGS.
We include risk aversion in our extended model as one of the potentially omitted

variables because some researchers argue that individuals differ in their savings and savings
behavior because they differ in their person’s willingness take financial risk (Cohn et al. 1975;
Friend and Blume 1975; Guiso, Haliassos, and Bertaut 2002; Morin and Suarez 1983; Pålsson
1996; Palme, Sundén, and Söderlind 2007). Researchers have found evidence that cognitive
abilities partly explain variations in a person’s willingness to take risks (Bonsang and Dohmen
2015; Dohmen et al. 2010), and thus her portfolio choices.
IV. Results
In our basic specification, if it is true that the genetic endowment is exogenous to
economic and financial outcomes, a respondent’s and her spouse’s Alzheimer’s Disease PGS
should not be related to the amount and type of assets she holds. In contrast, Table 3 suggest that
Alzheimer’s Disease PGS is significantly associated with asset holdings in total financial assets,
stocks, IRA, other financial assets, and CDs. Respondents and spouses whose Alzheimer’s
Disease PGS is one standard deviation above the mean hold approximately 5, 11, 15 and 7
percent less in total financial assets, stocks, IRAs, and other financial assets, respectively. If she
has an Alzheimer’s Disease PGS that is one standard deviation above the mean then she holds
roughly 9 percent more wealth in CDs.
Table 4 presents coefficient estimates from the extended model that controls for a
parental history of memory problems and the interaction of that indicator with the AD PGS.
Parental history of memory problems explains variation in asset holding but not the association
between asset holding and the AD PGS. People save more in financial assets, cash-equivalent,
IRAs, and other financial assets when they have parents who have been diagnosed with memory
problems. In particular, if a person has a parental history of memory problems, she saves
14

statistically significantly more in total financial assets by 19 percent, in cash-equivalent by 19
percent, and other financial assets by 39 percent while his/her spouse’s parental history of
memory-related disease is associated with increases in total financial assets by 30 percent, cashequivalent by 24 percent, IRAs by 29 percent, and other financial assets by 36 percent. However,
our basic result remains even after allowing the association between asset holding and the AD
PGS to vary across people with/without a parental history of memory-related disease. A person
with higher genetic risk of Alzheimer’s Disease saves less in stocks (13 percent) and IRAs (17
percent) and saves more in CDs (9 percent); these associations remain statistically significant.
Thus, the first hypothesis does not fully explain the association between savings and the
Alzheimer’s Disease PGS.
Table 5 presents coefficient estimates from the extended model that controls for the
respondent and spouses’ cognition PGS, the HRS total cognition score, and the interaction of
both variables with the AD PGS. Across all categories of assets, the PGS for general cognition is
uncorrelated with savings and there is no statistically significant different in the general
cognition PGS across people with higher/lower AD PGS.
While Table 5 results show that respondents and spouses with higher total cognition
scores hold more of almost all asset types, the interaction of the cognition and Alzheimer’s
polygenic sores does not explain our basic finding. The first result comports with previously
reported findings that cognitive ability is correlated with financial decisions, especially stock
market participation (Christelis et al. 2010; Grinblatt et al. 2011). Her spouse’s cognition score is
positively correlated with asset holdings in most of the financial instruments except for CDs.
Controlling for the interaction between the total cognition score and the Alzheimer’s Disease
PGS, a person with higher genetic risk of developing Alzheimer’s Disease still saves 7, 16, and 8
percent less in financial assets, IRAs, and other financial assets respectively. A person with a
higher AD PGS holds 13 percent more in CDs. The effect size of Alzheimer’s Disease PGS on
savings in these financial instruments is slightly greater than that presented in Table 3. Thus, the
second hypothesis does not explain the correlation between the Alzheimer’s Disease PGS and
saving decisions.
Table 6 reports results from the extended model that interacts the Alzheimer’s Disease
PGS with age and age-squared (divided by 1000). We do this to test the hypothesis that the AD
15

PGS of a given individual varies systematically with his/her age. We also report the chi-squared
statistics on the test of the joint significance of the coefficients on every variable involving the
respondent/spouse AD PGS.
The AD PGS interaction terms capture differences in the AD PGS-asset holding
association across people of different ages. Holding those differences constant, the coefficient on
the AD PGS measures the variation in holdings of each asset type across people with different
AD PGS.
Table 6 presents three main results. First, there is evidence that the AD PGS-asset
holding correlation differs with age for stocks. Second, holding constant age-related differences
in the AD PGS-asset holdings correlation, people with higher AD PGS hold substantially fewer
assets in stocks. Third, in the other asset categories, accounting the age-related differences in the
AD PGS-asset holding correlation explains the basic finding. After controlling for the
interaction, people with different Alzheimer’s Disease PGS do not save more or less overall or in
IRAs, CDs, and other financial assets. We find supporting evidence for the third hypothesis: if
we account for the interplay between age and Alzheimer’s Disease PGS, the Alzheimer’s
Disease PGS can be considered to be an exogenous assignment.
V. Extended model results
In Table 7, Table 8 and Table 9 we considered additional variables omitted from the basic model
that might account for the baseline findings we report in Table 3.
Table 7 reports results when we add a measure of a person’s self-reported memory
problems and interact it with the AD PGS. Results are almost identical to results in our Table 3
baseline models. Even after controlling for the interaction term, a one-standard deviation
increase in a person’s Alzheimer’s PGS is associated with decreases in asset holdings in total
financial assets, stocks, IRAs, and other financial assets and with an increase in savings in CDs.
Therefore, individuals’ perception about their memory does not fully account for the correlation
between the Alzheimer’s Disease PGS and savings. This seems to suggest that individuals’
learning process through aging is not fully reflected in their self-rated perception of memory, but
it is rather a more complex process.

16

Table 8 presents results from the model that adds a measure of risk aversion. The results
suggest that differences in an individual’s risk aversion may explain some of the correlation
between the Alzheimer’s Disease PGS and savings in a particular type of assets. The effect of the
Alzheimer’s Disease PGS on the amount savings in total financial assets, stocks, and CDs is no
longer statistically significant and the size of the effect decreases compared to the baseline model
presented in Table 3. However, the effect of a person’s Alzheimer’s Disease PGS on the amount
saved in IRAs and other financial assets remains statistically different from zero (p< 0.05).
Specifically, the person’s Alzheimer’s Disease PGS is associated with decreases in asset
holdings in IRAs and other financial assets by 13 percent and 8 percent, respectively. The result
indicates that a person’s willingness to take risk may account for the correlation between the
Alzheimer’s Disease PGS and savings in total financial assets, stocks, and CDs but not savings
in IRAs and other financial assets, and thus the third hypothesis (the learning by aging process)
might be a better explanation for the association.
Table 9 reports results from the models that include the variables that flag a respondent’s
planning horizon. Results show that people with longer planning horizons allocate more wealth
in total financial assets, stocks, cash-equivalent, IRAs, CDs, and other financial assets. This
result is similar to results presented in Barth et al. (2017). We find a similar pattern for the
relation between her spouse’s time horizon and household savings. After adding these variables,
the correlation between the Alzheimer’s Disease PGS and savings in other financial assets is no
longer statistically significant. The coefficient on the respondent’s Alzheimer’s Disease PGS
remains statistically significant in the model of savings in total financial assets, stocks, IRAs and
CDs. Thus, we conclude that the planning horizon does not fully account for the correlation
between the Alzheimer’s Disease PGS and savings.
V. Conclusion
We start with a basic result that suggests that one observes different savings behavior
between people with lower and higher genetic risk of developing Alzheimer’s Disease. In our
basic models, we find that people with higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s Disease save more
in assets that require less active management and less in assets that need to be managed more.
This pattern is not consistent with the assumption that people do not know their genetic risk of
developing ADRD. This pattern seems consistent with several possible mechanisms that we
17

explore. We explored whether people might know their potential for developing Alzheimer’s
disease from their family histories; whether they were cognitively limited; and whether they
might begin to realize with more precision their risk of developing ADRD as they age.
Our results suggest that the latter explanation accounts for the observed correlation
between savings (of a given type) and the genetic risk of developing Alzheimer’s Disease. We
find that once one controls for the correlation between age and the Alzheimer’s PGS, the direct
association between savings of a particular type and the Alzheimer’s PGS disappears.
This finding suggests that, as people age, those with higher Alzheimer’s Disease PGS
alter their savings type and amounts. Such changes in behavior may simply reflect a person’s
recognition of accumulating forgetfulness or it may reflect a more complicated process that
involves adult children more actively intervening. The results suggest that people might adjust
their savings behavior if doctors would use genetic tests to inform them whether they face a
higher risk of developing ADRD later in life. A second and important implication of our results
is that genomics researchers should explore whether or not it makes sense to assume people do
not know their genetic risk of any given behavior.
