    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper has two goals: first to describe a theoretical model which derives relationships among migration decisions explicitly from utility maximization under uncertainty; and second, to examine why nations vary in their internal migration.  To explain variation in internal migration, we hypothesize that the degree of monetization and industrialization of an economy is inversely related to the family cohesiveness; hence, a given percentage increase in relative income will have higher migratory effect in a relatively more monetized economy.  The availability of higher initial information and better transportation systems in these economies strongly complement this effect.  These hypothesis are confirmed by the estimates based on the U.S. and Italian data.\n\n",
