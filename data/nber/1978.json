    "abstract": "\n\nWe present a methodology for estimating the welfare gains from a product\nwith new characteristics, and apply it to Japanese and American compact\ntrucks. Our approach can be used on any products for which a hedonic\nregression can be estimated. For 1979-80 we find average welfare gains of\n$500-600 per Japanese truck. In later years the benefit to consumers is\nreduced by the tariff on imports and the introduction of American compact\nmodels. American compacts have consumer gains which are much less than the\naverage for Japanese models, since for each American compact there is an\nimport with very similar characteristics.\n\n",
