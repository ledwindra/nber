    "abstract": "\n\nPublic recognition is frequently used to motivate desirable behavior, yet its welfare effects\u2014such as costs of shame or gains from pride\u2014are rarely measured. We develop a portable empirical methodology for measuring and monetizing social image utility, and we deploy it in experiments on exercise and charitable behavior. In all experiments, public recognition motivates desirable behavior but creates highly unequal image payo\ufb00s. High-performing individuals enjoy signi\ufb01cant utility gains, while low-performing individuals incur signi\ufb01cant utility losses. We estimate structural models of social signaling, and we use the models to explore the social e\ufb03ciency of public recognition policies.\n\n",
