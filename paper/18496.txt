ABSTRACT
What is the best way to incorporate a risk premium into the discount rate schedule for a real investment
project with uncertain payoffs? The standard CAPM formula suggests a beta-weighted average of
the return on a safe investment and the mean return on an economy-wide representative risky investment.
Suppose, though, that the project constitutes a tail-hedged investment, meaning that it is expected
to yield positive payoffs in catastrophic states of nature. Then the model of this paper suggests that
what should be combined in a weighted average are not the two discount rates, but rather the corresponding
two discount factors. This implies an effective discount rate schedule that declines over time from
the standard CAPM formula down to the riskfree rate alone. Some simple numerical examples are
given. Implications are noted for discounting long-term public investments and calculating the social
cost of carbon in climate change.

Risk-Adjusted Discount Rates

Abstract
What is the best way to incorporate a risk premium into the discount rate schedule
for a real investment project with uncertain payo¤s?

The standard CAPM formula

suggests a beta-weighted average of the return on a safe investment and the mean
return on an economy-wide representative risky investment.

Suppose, though, that

the project constitutes a tail-hedged investment, meaning that it is expected to yield
positive payo¤s in catastrophic states of nature. Then the model of this paper suggests
that what should be combined in a weighted average are not the two discount rates,
but rather the corresponding two discount factors.

This implies an e¤ective discount

rate schedule that declines over time from the standard CAPM formula down to the
riskfree rate alone.

Some simple numerical examples are given.

Iimplications are

noted for discounting long-term public investments and calculating the social cost of
carbon in climate change.

Introduction via Climate Change

Consider a long-term public-investment thought experiment used to calculate the social cost
of carbon. Start with some actual path of carbon dioxide emissions, representing some
given climate-change policy, along with the corresponding uncertain future trajectory of the
economy. Consider a simple variation of climate policy whereby one less ton of carbon

dioxide is emitted now. This variation will result in a displaced trajectory of uncertain
future outcomes. Waving away index number problems, suppose that “comprehensive consumption” is the universal numeraire of bene…ts or payo¤s.
The displaced trajectory
translates, ultimately, into uncertain payo¤s as measured for each period in terms of uncertain comprehensive-consumption increments. Suppose that, for each period, some known
fraction of payo¤s has the risk pro…le of the macroeconomy as a whole, while the remaining fraction constitutes independent diversi…able risk. The decision maker wants a simple
capital budgeting rule expressed in terms of expected payo¤s. At what project-speci…c
risk-adjusted rates should expected future payo¤s be discounted? This is a central question
for calculating the social cost of carbon, and it is taken as the central question of this paper.
The problem of choosing a discount rate has long bedeviled cost-bene…t analysis (CBA),
but its relevance has been greatly magni…ed lately because economists are increasingly being
asked to analyze projects or activities whose e¤ects will be felt very far out into the future.
Many examples concern environmental activities, including nuclear waste management, loss
of biodiversity, groundwater alterations, minerals depletion, and so forth. The most prominent example is the economics of climate change, which will be used throughout this paper
as a motivating example.
The e¤ects of climate change will be spread out over what might be called the “distant
future” – up to centuries and even millennia from now. The logic of compound interest
forces us to say that what one might conceptualize as monumental events do not much matter
when they occur in the distant future. Perhaps even more disconcerting, when exponential
discounting is extended over very long time periods there is a notoriously hypersensitive
dependence of CBA on the choice of a discount rate. Seemingly insigni…cant di¤erences in
discount rates can make an enormous di¤erence in the present discounted value of distantfuture payo¤s. In many long-run situations, including climate change, it may not be too
much of an exaggeration to say that almost any answer to a CBA question can be defended
by one particular choice or another of a discount rate.
What is the appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate schedule for a given public investment?
Realistically, probably the most we can hope for is a theory that will frame a
conceptual answer to this critically important question clearly in terms of more fundamental
constructs. Here two prototype discount rates stand out. One is the economy-wide average return on all investments. The other is the so-called riskfree rate on safe investments.
Unfortunately, the numerical di¤erence between these two focal rates of return is enormous,
leading to much debate and confusion about what risk-adjusted discount rates should be
used for a particular project. The consequences can be spectacularly important for very
long term CBA applications, like investments in climate change.

The average return on all investments in a country is often proxied by the mean real historical return on a comprehensive index of equities traded on that country’s stock exchanges.
For the U.S., whose stock markets are relatively large in representing the private economy
and which have a long uninterrupted historical record, this number is approximately seven
percent per year.1 The U.S. O¢ ce of Management and Budget uses 7% as “an estimate
of the average pretax real rate of return on private capital in the U.S. economy.”2 Without
further ado, for the purposes of this paper I identify the economy-wide average return on all
investments as being re = 7%.
The riskfree rate on a safe investment is typically proxied by the average real return on
very short term U.S. treasury bills. This number is about one percent per year.3 Once
again proceeding without further ado, for the purposes of this paper I identify the relevant
riskfree rate on safe investments (real and …nancial) as being rf = 1%.
Needless to say, it can make a stunning di¤erence for long-term CBA outcomes whether
distant-future payo¤s are discounted at re = 7% or at rf = 1%. If a payo¤ a century and
a half from now is discounted at rf = 1% per year, its present discounted value is over eight
thousand times greater than if the same payo¤ were discounted at re = 7% per year!
There is some consensus that when the future payo¤s on an uncertain public investment
will be essentially proportional to the future level of the macroeconomy, then the appropriate discount rate for the project should be more or less the average rate of return on all
investments in the economy, here re = 7%. And there is also some consensus that when
the future payo¤s on an uncertain public investment will be essentially independent of the
future level of the macroeconomy, then the appropriate discount rate for the project should
be more or less the riskfree rate on a safe investment, here rf = 1%. Furthermore, there
is a widespread if somewhat more vague sense that “in between” cases should involve “in
between”discount rates, where the “in between”relative importance of each of the two prototype components re‡ects, in some way or another, the degree of correlation of their payo¤s
with the payo¤s of the particular public investment being considered. The central issue for
this paper concerns the appropriate value of these “in between”discount rates, in particular
their time pro…le or term structure.
In practical capital budgeting, a single constant discount rate is typically applied to all
future cash ‡ows. A standard default interpretation is that “the”appropriate project-speci…c
discount rate is of the famous CAPM (capital asset pricing model) form r = (1
) rf + re .
But suppose that the project constitutes a tail-hedged investment, meaning that it is expected

to yield positive payo¤s in catastrophic states of the world. (Climate change mitigation is
a prime example of a tail-hedged investment because payo¤s in terms of comprehensive
consumption net of climate damages are larger for high-damage outcomes.) Then the
model of this paper argues that what should more plausibly be combined in a beta-weighted
average at time t are not the two discount rates re and rf , but rather the corresponding two
discount factors exp( re t) and exp( rf t), in the form exp( rt t) = (1
) exp( rf t) +
exp( re t). Such a combination implies an e¤ective discount rate schedule that declines
over time beginning from the CAPM formula r 0 = (1
) rf + re (corresponding to t ! 0)
and monotonically decreasing towards the asymptotic value r 1 = rf (as t ! 1). The
tail-hedged model of this paper provides a new and di¤erent story justifying a declining term
structure of discount rates. The theory applies to capital budgeting more generally, but its
strongest empirical implications are probably for public investments in tail-hedged projects
having very long term payo¤s, like climate change mitigation.
The next section presents succinctly the key background formulas and applications that
are required for the paper, as derived from the simplest standard speci…cation of consumptionbased macroeconomic asset pricing. Using this background, a model of risk-adjusted discount rates is then developed and analyzed. Following presentation of the basic theory, the
paper gives a few simple numerical examples of risk-adjusted discount rate schedules. I also
make a few brief remarks about possible implications, in particular for calculating the social
cost of carbon.

Consumption-Based Asset Pricing With Fat Tails

The formulation used in this paper is the simplest fruit-tree model of i.i.d. (independent
identically distributed) consumption growth combined with an isoelastic utility function. In
this pure exchange model of a dynamic competitive general equilibrium, asset markets are
like phantom entities because no one actually ends up taking a net position in any of them.
Gross returns on an asset are payo¤s divided by asset price, with consumption as numeraire.
This model is absolutely standard in the macroeconomic …nance literature, so I just sketch
the main results here very brie‡y.4
The major di¤erence here with the standard presentation is that at the …nal stage in
4

The famous fruit-tree model of asset prices in a growing economy traces back to two seminal articles:
Lucas (1978) and Mehra and Prescott (1985). For applications, see the survey articles of Campbell (2003) or
Mehra and Prescott (2003), both of which also give due historical credit to the other pioneering originators
of the important set of ideas and the stylized empirical facts used throughout this paper. Citations for
the many sources of these (and related) seminal asset-pricing ideas are omitted here only to save space and
because they are readily available in the above two review articles. The presentation here follows most
closely my own formulation in Weitzman (2007).

this speci…cation I do not end the story by plugging into the formulas a normal distribution,
which, with the usual calibrations, would yield the equity-premium and riskfree rate puzzles.
Instead, I use a generic probability distribution that might resemble the calibrated normal
probability density function arbitrarily closely but di¤ers in having fatter tails. This implies
that large-sigma small-consumption outcomes have relatively higher (but still vanishingly
small) probabilities than the super-thin-tailed normal distribution.5 In putting a higher
probability weight on very bad outcomes, tail fattening reduces the magnitude of both puzzles
by simultaneously raising the equity premium and lowering the riskfree rate.
It should be emphasized at the outset that the notion of “consumption”used throughout
this paper is intended to be much more inclusive than the ordinary conventional de…nition.
Here consumption is comprehensive in the sense that it is ideally adjusted for externalities,
environmental amenities, and so forth. For example, in the presence of climate change net
consumption has already been adjusted here by the subtraction of climate-change damages
from gross consumption. Such an all-inclusive comprehensive net measure of consumption
will sometimes be called “e¤ective”consumption for special emphasis. E¤ective consumption here is an all-encompassing measure of overall well being that characterizes the state
of the economy. Essentially, e¤ective consumption, denoted C, is that scalar index number
which gives rise to utility U , and the utility function U (C) is a function only of e¤ective consumption C. E¤ective consumption is an abstraction, for which conventional consumption
may, or may not, be a decent proxy, depending on the application. I assume heroically that
conventional consumption and “e¤ective” consumption have been similar in the past, but I
allow them to possibly diverge in the presence of future climate change.
Let t denote the time period. The present period is t = 0. E¤ective consumption Ct in
future period t 1 is uncertain. The evolution of e¤ective consumption is described by the
stochastic process
Ct = Ct 1 Gt ;
(1)
where Gt in (1) represents the gross growth of e¤ective consumption in period t. It is
assumed that the random variables fGt g are i.i.d. positive.
The representative agent’s utility function is U (C). Let be the non-negative instantaneous rate of pure time preference or utility discount rate. The multiplicative factor for
discounting utility of period t into current utility is exp( t).
The representative agent’s
5
I call the normal probability distribution “super thin tailed” because it is exponential quadratic, as opposed to exponential linear (the usual characterization of a thin-tailed distribution). The normal probability
of a three-sigma event is .001, which drops to .00003 for a four-sigma event. These probabilities seem to me
to be much too small for analyzing seriously many situations of tail-sensitive disastrous impacts.

It is critical to realize that the above formulas hold for any assumed probability distribution of the random variable G. In what follows next I take a temporary detour to consider
calibration of ln G to a normal probability distribution, but the paper is ultimately interested
in fatter-tailed distributions than the super-thin-tailed normal.
Without loss of generality consider a transformation of random variable from G to Z,
where Z = ln G, or
G = exp(Z):
(18)
Following the standard literature, assume, here temporarily and as an aside, that Z is
normally distributed
ZsN ; 2 ;
(19)
which means that G is lognormally distributed.
Plugging (19), (18) into (7), (8) and taking the expectation of a lognormal distribution
obtains the well-known augmented Ramsey formula for the riskfree rate

where g ln EG = + 2 =2.
Next plug (19), (18) into (15), (16) and take the expectation of the resulting lognormal
distribution. Combine the result with (20) and (17) to obtain the well-known formula for
the equity premium
2
=
:
(21)
As an example of calibration, without further ado I pick the following representative
worldwide values: = 2:5, g = 2% annually, = 4% annually, = :5% annually. Using
these chosen values the riskfree rate calculated from formula (20) is rf = 4:8% (instead of
rf = 1%), which discrepancy is the so-called riskfree rate puzzle. With the chosen calibration
values the equity premium calculated from formula (21) is = 0:4% (instead of = 6%),
which discrepancy is the so-called equity premium puzzle.
It is critical to realize fully that both of these empirical puzzles arise here under the
assumption of a super-thin-tailed normal distribution of Z. A mean-preserving spread of G
will simultaneously reduce the magnitude of both puzzles. (Note from (20) that the riskfree
rate rf decreases in 2 , while from (21) the equity premium increases in 2 , which is a
speci…c instance of this more general result applied to the particular lognormal family of
probability distributions.) The generic argument goes as follows.
8

The function G is convex. It follows immediately from equations (7), (8) that a
mean-preserving spread of G will decrease the riskfree rate rf .
Using (16), (15), and (8), (7), formula (17) can be rewritten as
exp( ) =

E (G=EG)
E (G=EG)1

:

(22)

Here and throughout the rest of the paper, assume > 1. The convex function (G=EG)
has everywhere a higher relative curvature than the convex function (G=EG)1 , while both
functions are equal to one at G=EG = 1. It follows that a mean preserving spread of G
increases E (G=EG) proportionately more than it increases E (G=EG)1 . The implication
from (22) is that a mean-preserving spread of G will increase the equity premium .
Consider what would happen if a Student-t probability distribution were assumed for Z
in place of the normal. The Student-t distribution is a su¢ cient statistic for a normal distribution with unknown parameters when drawn from a …nite sample. The size of the sample
corresponds to the number of degrees of freedom of the Student-t distribution. With enough
degrees of freedom (i.e., a large enough sample size), the Student-t probability distribution
appears indistinguishable from the normal. But the Student-t has a fat polynomial tail,
instead of the normal’s super-thin exponential-quadratic tail, and a CRRA utility function is
very sensitive to the possibility of disastrously low levels of e¤ective consumption. It is readily shown by going to the limit of (7), (8) that for a Student-t distribution rf ! 1. When
the inde…nite integrals containing the Student-t distribution are simultaneously taken to the
limit in the numerator and denominator of formula (22), it can be shown that ! +1
(essentially because E (G=EG) in the numerator of (22) approaches in…nity faster than
E (G=EG)1 in the denominator of (22)).7
At this point I rely on an intuitive continuity argument that there is a way to reverseengineer a probability distribution whose tail properties are somewhere between a normal
and a Student-t, which, with the above calibration, would yield rf = 1% and re rf =
6%. This hybrid between a normal and a Student-t would look almost indistinguishable
from the calibrated normal, but would not give rise to the two asset pricing puzzles. A
di¤erent but related route to tail fattening was taken by Robert Barro (2006), who appended
an empirically plausible point distribution of a consumption disaster to the usual normal
distribution and was thereby able to diminish signi…cantly the magnitude of the two puzzles.
I am thus adopting an approach here that “explains”8 the equity-premium and riskfree-rate
7
These extreme results re‡ect the fact that the moment generating function of a Student-t distribution is
in…nite. More details about this entire set of issues are contained in Weitzman (2007), including attribution
of the basic ideas.
8
Many hundreds of articles with scores of di¤erent approaches have been used to “explain” the equity-

9

puzzles by a fatter-than-normal probability distribution of Z = ln G.
However it is accomplished, I henceforth assume that the probability distribution of
G has been implicitly chosen (along with implicitly chosen reasonable values of the …rst
two moments of the probability distribution of G and implicitly chosen reasonable values
of the key parameters and ) so that formulas (7), (8) imply rf = 1% and formulas
(15), (16) imply re = 7%. Technically G can have any probability distribution that is
consistent with the desired results rf = 1% and re = 7%, but is otherwise arbitrary. It
is not necessary to explicitly specify the details, but I am implicitly …tting the tails of the
probability distribution of Z = ln G to be fatter than the normal in such a way that the
underlying model of this paper is puzzle free. This model is such an over-simpli…ed version
of reality that it strains credulity, but at least the fatter-tailed version does not technically
carry the stigma of questionable legitimacy that comes from generating the equity-premium
and riskfree-rate puzzles.

A Model of Cost-Bene…t Analysis

Consider a marginal investment project proposed at the present time zero. The project
promises small payo¤s of uncertain net bene…ts during future periods t, which are represented
by the random variable Bt (expressed in units of future e¤ective consumption Ct ). Suppose
that the project costs the equivalent of a small sure reduction of e¤ective consumption in
the present period (expressed in units of present e¤ective consumption C0 ). Should the
proposed project be undertaken?
We seek a project-speci…c discount rate schedule, denoted frt g, such that undertaking
the proposed investment will improve welfare if and only if the project’s present cost is
less than its expected present discounted bene…ts

We cannot make further progress on deriving and understanding the appropriate riskadjusted discount rate schedule without specifying in more detail the risk properties of the
uncertain future bene…ts. We seek to decompose Bt into familiar and analytically-tractable
components. We are looking for some simple guideline conceptualization that would allow
premium and riskfree-rate puzzles. See Mehra (2008) for a critical discussion of the various proposals that
have been put forth. My favored explanation, which the model of this paper follows, belongs to a subset
of explanations that are based on fat-tailed probabilities of outlier catastrophic events. More details are
described in Weitzman (2007), including attribution of the basic ideas.

a plausible extension of the “beta” decomposition of …nancial returns, which is familiar
from the CAPM theory of …nance, into the domain of real-project payo¤s. It turns out
that this is not a trivial task because …nancial returns are di¤erent entities from project
payo¤s, having di¤erent units of measurement and requiring some kind of normalization
to make them comparable. A …nancial investment beta is expressed in terms of the risk
properties of …nancial returns (which is natural for …nancial asset pricing), whereas realproject bene…ts come expressed in terms of the risk properties of real payo¤s (which is natural
for cost-bene…t analysis). Financial returns come in a form that is already endogenously
normalized via dividing payo¤s by their asset prices, whereas real-project payo¤s must be
exogenously normalized to get them expressed in a form that highlights the decomposition
of their essential risk characteristics.
For speci…city, the investigation of this paper is focused sharply on CBA of small investments that only incrementally impact distant-future events. However, many climate
change investments may themselves be big and involve large impacts. Yet even after some
of these big investments have been made, the issue of choosing the appropriate risk-adjusted
discount rate for additional marginal investments remains important and is emblematic of
a whole series of thorny issues concerning how to conceptualize and how to evaluate risky
actions spanning across many generations. The discount rate represents the current price of
future bene…ts or costs, and as such its risk adjustment is a convenient shorthand vehicle
for studying the general nature of how investment tradeo¤s depend upon underlying risk
relationships between the investment and the rest of the economy.
The derivation of the values of rt to be used in (23) can begin as follows. Start by
examining a hypothetical point-input point-output investment project whose single payo¤
at time t is given by Bt . Let h be the hypothetical loss of e¤ective consumption at time zero
which would leave the representative agent exactly indi¤erent between accepting or rejecting
this hypothetical project. Then h must satisfy the condition
U 0 (C0 ) h = e

E[U 0 (Ct ) Bt ]:

(24)

By de…nition, the corresponding discount rate rt appropriate to (23) obeys the equation
h = exp( rt t) EBt :

Combining (26) with (25) and eliminating h gives the basic equation
exp( rt t) =

I now make a fundamental distinction between two di¤erent types or classes of investments. A “tail-hedged” investment is expected to pay positive bene…ts in catastrophic
states of nature. A “tail-exposed” investment is not expected to pay positive bene…ts in
catastrophic states of nature. It turns out that there is a fundamental di¤erence in the
behavior of risk-adjusted discount rates for tail-hedged as opposed to tail-exposed investments. This paper is mainly interested in tail-hedged investments, with the prototype being
projects that mitigate future climate damages via lower current emissions of GHGs. However, to appreciate the distinction between risk-adjusted discount rates for the two types of
investments, I …rst analyze brie‡y the case of a tail-exposed investment.

Discounting a Tail-Exposed Investment

Let Bt j Ct be a random variable representing bene…t payo¤s Bt conditional on e¤ective
consumption being Ct .
I will say that a project constitutes a tail-exposed investment if, for all future t,
lim E[Bt j Ct ] = 0:

(27)

Ct !0

The terminology “tail-exposed” investment comes from the fact that the project is not
expected to pay any insurance against catastrophic states of nature. Although it is possible
to analyze tail-exposed investments in greater generality, I restrict myself to payo¤ bene…ts

To summarize this section, when the functional form (28) is imposed, then the riskadjusted discount rate is constant for all periods. Thus, the main thrust of this paper
that the term structure of the risk-adjusted discount rate schedule can decline over time
towards the riskfree rate is very much dependent on the assumption that the project is not
tail-exposed. The rest of the paper concerns how and why risk-adjusted discount rates for
tail-hedged investments exhibit a declining term structure.

This is a well-known result in the literature. See, e.g., Mehra (2008). I don’t fully trust conclusions
based on the lognormality assumption because they give rise to the riskfree rate and equity premium puzzles.

Discounting a Tail-Hedged Investment

I will say that a project constitutes a tail-hedged investment if
lim E[Bt j Ct ] > 0

Ct !0

(35)

for all future t. Notice that a project described by (35) is not actually required to deliver
positive bene…ts to satisfy (35); it is merely expected to deliver positive bene…ts. In the
remainder of the paper I assume that the project under consideration constitutes a tailhedged investment.
The terminology “tail-hedged investment” should be obvious.
I would argue that
climate-change projects that lower GHG emissions should plausibly be treated as tail-hedged
investments. When (35) holds, then at least some protection is a¤orded against terrible
states of the world by investing in mitigation. Even for dismal states of very low net e¤ective
consumption and very high marginal utility caused by catastrophic climate damages, the
project is at least expected to deliver a positive bene…t payo¤.
The story that accompanies (35) is that if disastrous future states of extremely low
net e¤ective consumption and extremely high marginal utility occur, then they will likely
be caused by huge damages from catastrophic climate change being subtracted from gross
consumption. In this scenario, future states of very high marginal utility and very low
net e¤ective consumption are identi…ed with strictly positive expected bene…ts from current
curtailment of GHGs, which will reduce future climate-change damages.10
From the above logic, investments in climate mitigation will pay o¤ in states of nature
for which the economy will be severely damaged and utility will be severely diminished
by a catastrophic climate-caused disaster. I will model this kind of situation by having
a strictly positive ‡oor at , below which expected bene…ts from mitigation may not fall no
matter how disastrously low is e¤ective consumption. Although it is possible to analyze
tail-hedged investments in greater generality, I restrict myself to payo¤ bene…ts being of a
highly-tractable “prototype”additive form.
In what follows, I try to parallel the standard CAPM model, only with real-bene…t payo¤s
in place of …nancial returns. By rough analogy with CAPM theory, de…ne

discount rates should be low. If bt
0, then this argument is very easy to make, almost
too easy, because the relevant project beta is then less than or equal to zero, implying that
the relevant discount rate is not higher than rf . I want to show that the discount rate
rt declines towards rf over time even when the covariance between Bt and Ct is strictly
positive.
With bt de…ned by (36), we can then express the relationship between Bt (representing
real bene…t payo¤s at time t) and Ct (representing the systematic non-diversi…able risk of
the uncertain macro-economy itself at time t) in the linear regression format
Bt = at + bt Ct + "t ;

(37)

with E"t = 0 and cov("t ; Ct ) = 0. Thus, bt de…ned by (36) can be interpreted as the
coe¢ cient from a hypothetical OLS regression of Bt on Ct of the form (37). The regression
here is largely hypothetical because in most cost-bene…t situations we don’t typically observe
more than one realization of a payo¤ at any given time. This scarcity of data makes it
very di¢ cult to estimate bt or at for public projects having no good analogue in the private
sector. Such kind of generic problem seems intrinsic to unique or nearly-unique projects and
bedevils empirical attempts to actually quantify a value for real-project betas.
The realproject model of this paper therefore constitutes more of a CAPM-like organizing principle
or conceptual framework than an actual usable structure ready to be taken to the data, as
is much more characteristic of the …nancial version of CAPM theory.
Condition (35) translates into at > 0. The random variable
At

is independent of Ct and can be interpreted as representing idiosyncratic project-speci…c
risk. Using (38), equation (37) can be re-expressed as

The coe¢ cient t is called the real-project beta here because it plays a role in cost-bene…t
analysis akin to a …nancial investment beta in the standard linear version of CAPM. As will
be shown later, …nancial investment betas and real-project betas are identical for two-period
short-run situations, but otherwise they may di¤er.
Formula (42) emphasizes that the variation of Bt can be conceptualized as if it is a kind
of imaginary portfolio with the fraction 1
t being contributed by a component having
the variation properties of At while the fraction t is contributed by a component having
the variation properties of Ct . On average, the fraction t of the project-payo¤ portfolio
at time t replicates the non-diversi…able risk characteristics of the system-wide aggregate
economy at that time, while the fraction (1
t ) of the project-payo¤ portfolio replicates
risk characteristics that are idiosyncratically independent of the performance of the aggregate
economy.

Equation (47) is the fundamental result of this paper. Given the linear decomposition
of risk factors (42), equation (47) provides a rigorous welfare basis for using expression (23)
as the theoretically correct formula for calculating expected present discounted payo¤s in
cost-bene…t analysis. When rt is de…ned by (47), a proposed marginal investment project
will improve welfare if and only if the project’s present discounted expected bene…ts (23) are
greater than its present costs.
We could proceed with a general analysis of frt g in terms of f t g using formula (47),
but I think it is more instructive to highlight primarily the benchmark case of a constant
real-project beta.

The Benchmark of a Constant Real-Project Beta

Henceforth I assume as a benchmark default simpli…cation that t = is constant for all
future periods t 1. This is de…nitely an assumption, but one that seems like a natural point
of departure for further analysis because could always be conceptualized as an “average”
future value of t serving as a prototype example for understanding the basic properties of
risk-adjusted discount rates more generally. Or, might be conceptualized as the limiting
value of t with the analysis of this section holding rigorously for large t, which is the case of
most interest here anyway. It is di¢ cult enough to assign a real-world value to even if it
were constant, let alone to impose some time-dependent structure t on top of . To be clear,
there is no problem with allowing the real-project beta to be time dependent except for the
more cumbersome notation and less facile interpretation that goes along with substituting
in derived formulas.
t for
The case of a constant real-project beta should therefore be viewed as a benchmark
speci…cation that will allow us to focus more sharply on essentials. Without further ado, I
therefore make an assumption of constant proportions of payo¤ risk, meaning that the riskvariation characteristics of the payo¤s Bt are decomposed into a constant proportion 1
of independent idiosyncratic project-speci…c risk and a constant proportion of systematic
non-diversi…able risk representing the uncertain macro-economy itself. For all future periods
t 1, then,

Equation (49) has a su¢ ciently simple form that the properties of rt are easily analyzed.

What is the economic story behind the basic result of this paper that the risk-adjusted
discount rate schedule declines over time (from an initial weighted average given by the
standard CAPM formula (51) down to approaching asymptotically the riskfree rate (52))?
The story goes along the following lines. Investing in the independent payo¤ component
At =EAt (relative to investing in the macro-economy component Ct =ECt ) is like buying an
insurance policy against the low-consumption bad states of the world that are inherent in
taking a gamble on an investment in Ct =ECt . The price of having an extra unit of At =EAt
relative to the price of having an extra unit of Ct =ECt is Ptf =Pte = exp( rf t)= exp( re t) =
exp( t), where is the equity premium. This relative price represents a measure of the
value of insurance that hedges against low values of Ct =ECt .
Having an insurance policy in the form of having an investment in At =EAt as part of
a portfolio of payo¤s is relatively more valuable over time than having an investment in
Ct =ECt (and this insurance value grows at the strong exponential rate ). Why? Because
the uncertain future consumption Ct =ECt is more variable over time and the agent is therefore increasingly fearful of catastrophic risks. Thus, it turns out, a declining risk-adjusted
discount rate schedule is intimately tied to the increasing value of tail-hedged insurance
against the increasingly likely possibility of bad tail outcomes. This insight about the increasingly critical role of disastrous tail risks in discounting is su¢ ciently important to merit
elaborating its economic content somewhat further.
The variance of the product of independent random variables equals the product of their
expected squared values minus the square of the product of their expected values. Applied

(54)

when expressed in terms of the coe¢ cient of variation (41).
From (54), the coe¢ cient of variation [Ct ] increases monotonically in t at an exponential rate, which signi…es that uncertain future consumption Ct =ECt is becoming ever more
variable over time. It turns out mathematically that the random variable Ct =ECt ! 0
with probability approaching one as t ! 1.12 Because E[Ct =ECt ] = 1, the tendency
of Ct =ECt ! 0 along sample paths must be counterbalanced in the other direction by
ever-higher explosions of Ct =ECt occurring with ever-lower probabilities as t ! 1. Thus,
although Ct =ECt has an expected value of one for all horizons t, it tends to zero almost
surely as t ! 1. In this sense, the aversion to Ct =ECt in the payo¤ portfolio (42) is increasingly driven over time by the increasing likelihood of an aggregate catastrophe.13 In
a nutshell, the declining term structure of risk-adjusted discount rates (50), (51), (52) re‡ects the ever-growing importance of having some tail-hedged catastrophe insurance against
relying on ever-more-variable Ct =ECt in the portfolio of long term payo¤s.
Most of the literature on time-declining discount rates is concerned with safe investments
whose payo¤s are independent of consumption and whose term structure describes the behavior over time of the riskfree rate alone. In this literature the declining term structure
of the riskfree discount rate depends, ultimately, on the persistence over time of underlying
growth rates (or, more directly if more mechanically, on the persistence of interest rates
themselves).14 The explanation in this paper is fundamentally di¤erent. There is no persistence in the model of this paper because the random variables fGt g are assumed to be
i.i.d.. Declining discount rates emerge here from the fundamental interaction over time of
an investment component whose payo¤s are essentially independent of consumption with an
investment component whose payo¤s are essentially consumption.
The above comments notwithstanding, there is a useful way of conceptualizing (49) as if
12

This result is a special case of what is called in the literature “Kakutani’s theorem on product martingales.” See Martin (2012) for more details.
13
This is a particular example of the general theory developed recently in an important paper by Ian
Martin to explain why the valuation of long-dated assets is dominated by the possibility of catastrophic
outcomes. See Martin [2012] for details and numerous other examples.
14
This literature is elegantly synthesized in the forthcoming book by Christian Gollier (2012a). An
exception to the persistence explanation is an argument that over time the terms of trade turn in favor of
environmental amenities when they enter the utility function separately and have less than unit elasticity
of substitution with conventional consumption. This important insight was presented most strikingly in
Sterner and Persson (2008). Their model bears a familial reduced-form resemblance to the model of this
paper, where over time the terms of trade turn in favor of the independent component of a project’s payo¤.

one of two in…nitely persistent discount-rate possibilities materializes overnight. In this as-if
interpretation, can be conceptualized heuristically as if representing the probability that
some given higher discount rate re will persistently apply over all future time, while 1
represents the as-if probability that some given lower discount rate rf will persistently apply
over all future time. Suppose that an investment decision must be made today, exactly
one day before it is revealed whether the future discount rate will, for tomorrow and forever
after, be re (with probability ) or whether it will be rf (with probability 1
). Then,
heuristically, the e¤ective rate that should be used today to discount payo¤s at time t is the
value rt satisfying (49) and having the properties (50), (51), (52). The key intuitive insight
here is that what should be probability-averaged over states of the world is not discount rates
(re with probability and rf with probability 1
) at various times, but discount factors
(exp( re t) with probability and exp( rf t) with probability 1 ).15 In the limit as t ! 1,
the properly-averaged discount factor corresponds to the minimum possible discount rate,
here rf . Intuitively or heuristically, the impact of the higher discount rate re in formula (49)
diminishes over time because the higher rate re e¤ectively discounts itself out of existence,
leaving the …eld to the lower discount rate rf . There is no pretending that this analogy is
rigorous, but it does present a vivid image of what is occurring.

Real-Project Betas and Discount-Rate Schedules

In practical terms, what is perhaps the most di¢ cult stumbling block for applications of the
discount rate schedule (49) to public investments in the real world is the estimation of actual
project-speci…c values of the real-project beta coe¢ cient . This is a very tricky subject
worthy of further research.16 My own feeling is that in many cases it may be di¢ cult to
go much beyond general considerations. However, even if is in practice knowable only
as a rough approximation to an average value, it is still useful to understand how its riskadjustment role might be properly conceptualized. The attitude of this paper is that it is
better to use the theoretically correct risk-adjustment formula for constant , augmented
by sensitivity analysis of , than to do nothing about risk adjustment. In any event, this
section explores the consequences for the term structure of discount rates of the linearity
assumption (42) coupled with the assumption (48) of a constant real-project beta.
The following comments are not much more than speculative ruminations.
If the
public investment is essentially “privatizable” then I would say that there is a fair default
15

A rigorous argument is presented in Gollier and Weitzman (2010), which also explains the background
of this idea and the relevant literature pertaining to it.

Some relevant thoughts on this subject are expressed in Ewijk and Tang (2003).

assumption that the project- is close to one. Perhaps a nationalized transportation sector
or a nationalized energy sector belong to this category. If the public investment is in things
that are very di¤erent from, and not readily substitutable for, material wealth, then, in the
absence of any private-sector analogue, I might say that there is a fair default assumption
that the project- is close to zero. Perhaps investments in repairing the ozone layer or
improving universal public health belong to this category. For unique one-o¤ projects, like
investments in mitigating climate change, it is going to be extremely di¢ cult to estimate
real-project betas because there is no close real-world substitute and no historical record
from which data could be assembled. For singular public investments that seem strongly
“non-privatizable”a constructive rule of thumb might be to begin with the default position
of the project- being set at about .5, which is midway between zero and one. This would
at least get a conversation going and could always be changed after more serious discussions.
In any event, there is no evading the need to specify a value of for any given investment
and there is no question that this can be more of an art than a science for one-of-a-kind
projects. With unique one-o¤ public investments, like climate change, I personally …nd it
somewhat easier to work backwards from some postulated near-term CAPM discount rate
r0 , which people have been observed to use in practice and for which I have some feel, to
the CAPM-implied value of . The basic motivating idea is that when people are using
a short term risk-adjusted CAPM discount rate of r0 in practice, then they are implicitly
revealing their preferred value of . Presuming constant proportions of payo¤ risks, this
implicitly revealed value of determines the corresponding term structure of discount rates
by formula (49).

discount rate as high as r0 =6%, which corresponds to a real-project beta as high as =5/6,
the century discount rate of 2.8% is closer to rf =1% than to re =7%. All of this is a
consequence of the enormous discrepancy between rf = 1% and re = 7%, which makes the
term structure of risk-adjusted discount rates decline steeply over time in approaching the
asymptotic limit of rf =1%.
While there is no getting around the fact that the time schedule of risk-adjusted discount
rates depends upon the assumed value of the real-project beta, the results of Table 1 suggest
a strong downward pull over time. This is the basic message of the paper. In the linear
case (42) corresponding to the standard CAPM speci…cation, the large equity premium of
re rf = 6% tends to cause the time pro…le of risk-adjusted discount rates to tilt steeply
downwards. The standard practice is to use the constant beta-averaged CAPM discount
rates r0 = (1
) rf + re (given by the column t=0 in Table 1) instead of the beta-averaged
discount factors exp( rt t) = (1
) exp( rf t) + exp( re t) (which give rise to the riskadjusted discount rate schedules displayed in Table 1). The message conveyed by Table 1 is
that this standard practice (of conceptualizing risk adjustments by modifying via CAPM the
discount rate while otherwise allowing it to be constant) could possibly have the potential
for signi…cantly biasing CBA against long-term investments whose real-project beta is less
than one.

Some Brief Remarks on the Social Cost of Carbon

In this section I attempt to apply the preceding framework and results to the discounting
issues that lie behind calculating the social cost of carbon. This application is not very
23

“pure”because what has actually been done so far in practice does not …t snugly within the
framework of this paper. Nevertheless, to the extent that long-term discounting is such a
central part of computing the social cost of carbon (and the estimates depend so critically
on the discount rate that is used), the results of this paper may shed some new light on the
key role of risk adjustment. The issues associated with determining a real-project beta for
investments in climate change mitigation are quite subjective and very tricky. I can o¤er
little more than some crude re‡ections here.
The “social cost of carbon”(hereafter SCC) is a useful economic concept that has come
to the fore in recent analysis of climate change. For the purposes of this paper, the SCC is
the marginal cost in‡icted on the future economy by emitting an extra ton of carbon dioxide
(CO2 ) now. It should be fairly obvious that such a number might be useful in a wide variety
of contexts for analyzing various policies that directly or indirectly a¤ect emissions of carbon
dioxide, of which there is potentially a very large number. My description of how the SCC
is estimated is a highly stylized interpretation of the procedure that was employed by the
U.S. Government Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Carbon, hereafter the
USGI working group.17 My remarks are focused mainly on the assumed discount rates and
the assumed speci…cation of damages.
In the very loosest of terms, what the USGI working group did can be described roughly
as follows. Start with a so-called “integrated assessment model” (IAM).18 An IAM is a
computational model with dozens of equations that combines a very basic model of economic
growth with a very basic model of climate change. The IAM is …rst run on the computer for
some base case of climate change policy that speci…es some actual path of CO2 emissions.
This will produce a series of outcomes, including a baseline time series of future e¤ective
consumption levels. If the IAM has key uncertain elements built into it, which it should
for the model to to be credible, the baseline e¤ective consumption levels will be uncertain.
Tweak the IAM baseline emissions policy by forcing it to emit one less ton of CO2 now,
but otherwise leave climate change policy the same as the base case. This will produce
a series of altered outcomes, including an altered time series of uncertain future e¤ective
consumption levels. The bene…t payo¤ in any period is the change in consumption between
the tweaked and baseline scenarios for that period. Compute by simulations the average
bene…t payo¤ (equals average e¤ective consumption change) in each period. Pick some
discount rate schedule and calculate the present discounted value of average bene…t payo¤s.
This is the SCC.
17

See US Working Group (2010). Also relevant is the discussion in Greenstone, Kopits, and Wolverton
(2011). Nordhaus (2011) provides an interpretation, some criticisms, and some alternative estimates.
18
The USGI working group actually used an average from three IAMs, whose acronyms are DICE, FUND,
and PAGE. This detail does not seem important for the general purposes of this paper.

24

At the heart of an IAM is a series of equations describing the relationship between
changes in CO2 emissions, subsequent changes in global mean temperatures, and corresponding changes in welfare-equivalent as-if damages to e¤ective consumption caused by
increased global mean temperatures. A majority of IAMs make damages apply to production of output, as opposed to damages applying directly to consumption, but I am not sure
this detail is critical and here slide over the distinction.19
IAMs tend to express damages as if there has been a welfare-equivalent loss of some
fraction of output (here interpreted as a fraction of ordinary consumption), where the size
of the fractional loss increases with the mean global temperature change. But why is it
so standard to express damages as a fraction of output? The answer is simple: because
it is so very di¢ cult to conceptualize damages in any other terms. (If we could imagine
that future damages a century from now were somehow given to us in the form of absolute
values, then the very …rst thing we would want to do for conceptualization is to convert this
absolute value into the welfare-equivalent fractional loss of output or consumption at that
time.) What tends to get obscured is the as if aspect of this arti…cial construct. Climate
damages act as if some fraction of welfare-equivalent consumption has been lost –they do
not typically cause a literal evaporation of consumption.
Now comes an important question. Should the fraction of as-if lost future consumption
from temperature damages be conceptualized as a fraction of expected future consumption or
the same fraction of actual future realizations of stochastic consumption, or some weighted
average of the two, and if so what should the weights be? In a deterministic setting it
makes no di¤erence. But in an uncertain setting this distinction amounts to choosing the
real-project beta. Without much thought or discussion, the IAMs presume that temperature
damages are proportional to actual stochastic consumption. Thus, more by default than by
conscious premeditation, the IAMs have inadvertently preempted the discounting issue by
choosing in practice a project beta of one. But then consistency might require discounting
the expected consumption changes at a high rate of re =7%, while what is chosen in practice
as a rate to discount reduced consumption damages in SCC calculations is typically in a
lower range of 3-4%.20 So the approach that is taken in practice is not directly cognizant
of real-project betas. This may be no small matter because the choice of a discount rate
can make an enormous di¤erence in calculating the SCC.
This paper seems to be suggesting the following loose thoughts about computing the SCC.
19

If the distinction matters, a cynic might say so much the worse for the IAM, since with climate change
it is di¢ cult to provide a good story why the one as-if damages speci…cation rather than the other as-if
damages speci…cation should be used.
20
The USGI working group (2010) used as a central estimate a discount rate of 3%. Nordhaus (2011)
e¤ectively uses 4% in his calculations.

25

No one is saying that it is easy to estimate the relevant real-project beta for abating one ton
of carbon dioxide, but attempts to measure the SCC might try various values of within a
framework of time-declining discount rates. The stochastic nature of future consumption
might be modeled more carefully and explicitly.
In the speci…cation of damages it could
be made more explicit what are the proportions in which the postulated fractional loss of
consumption is intended to apply to expected consumption as opposed to actual stochastic
consumption. The rate used to discount expected future changes in consumption might
be made consistent with the real-project beta implicit in the form of the assumed damages
function, so that there is overall consistency.
What is the appropriate real-project beta for an investment that reduces by one ton
the present emissions of CO2 ? This is the key question, the answer to which I don’t think
anyone knows. About the best we can do here, I fear, may be to tell stories. One insurancelike story would argue for a lower beta on the grounds that climate change itself is part of
“e¤ective” consumption, especially for very bad climate outcomes. In this scenario, states
of lower future e¤ective consumption and higher marginal utility (from bad climate change)
will be correlated with higher future bene…ts from current curtailment of CO2 .21 This story
treats mitigation as a low-beta hedge asset helping to insure against climate disasters. In
the standard story, which is told by the IAMs more by default than premeditation, higher
conventional future consumption is associated with larger absolute damages from climate
change (either because damages are assumed to be multiplicative in stochastic consumption
realizations or because higher growth is assumed to be associated with higher emissions). In
this case, states of higher future consumption and lower marginal utility will be associated
with higher absolute future bene…ts from current curtailment of CO2 , thereby implying a
higher beta.22
In any event, postulating =1 seems to me like a somewhat extreme assumption on the
intuitive presumption that climate change investment payo¤s seem so very di¤erent from
the average payo¤s of private-sector investments. The e¤ects of climate change will impact
extremely unevenly among di¤erent regions of the world and di¤erent sectors of human or
natural activity. “Outdoor” activities (like agriculture, recreation, natural landscapes, the
existence value of ecosystems, and so forth) will be much more a¤ected than the “indoor”
activities that constitute the bulk of a conventional economy. Besides, some component
of mitigation payo¤s plausibly represents insurance against fat-tailed catastrophic future
outcomes due to extreme climate change itself.
If =1/2, then the highlighted row of Table 1 suggests a corresponding risk-adjusted

discount rate that declines from 4% in the immediate future down to 1.7% a century from
now and down further to 1.2% three centuries from now. If the CAPM discount rate is
r0 =3%, which might be interpreted as corresponding to the constant value of 3% chosen by
the USGI working group, the implied value of beta is 1/3, in which case Table 1 suggests a
corresponding risk-adjusted discount rate that declines down to 1.4% a century from now and
down further to 1.1% three centuries from now. The most serious climate change damages
will be incurred over the course of centuries. Lowering the (constant) discount rate from 3%
to 2.5% increased the SCC value in the USGI working group estimates from $21 to $35 per
ton, so there is quite a bit of sensitivity. It might be interesting to calculate the SCC using
the risk-adjusted discount rate schedules from Table 1 that correspond to the short-term
CAPM discount rates of r0 3-4% that have been used in practice.
The determination of the appropriate real project beta for calculating the SCC is a very
di¢ cult issue. As yet there is no easy answer to the question of what is the appropriate
value of beta in a climate-change context.23 At the end of the day, I think the most we can
hope for is to be aware of the basic issues and to try out various values of in practice.

Concluding Comments on Tail-Hedged Discount Rates

This paper suggests several themes.
The paper reinforces the idea that adjusting the discount rate to incorporate project
risk represents a signi…cant unsettled issue for CBA of long-term public investments. An
economic analysis of climate-change investment policies, for example, depends enormously
on what discount rate is chosen. This in turn requires resolution of the issues raised about
how best to incorporate project uncertainty into a risk-adjusted discount rate.
The default conceptualization of risk-adjusted discounting has mostly envisioned using a
constant discount rate given by the CAPM formula r0 = (1
) rf + re . (In principle
it might be acknowledged that t should be allowed to depend on time, but in practice
the discussion rarely gets this far because it is di¢ cult enough to determine an average
for long-term public projects, much less to specify its time dependence.)
The model
of this paper is primitive and has a lot of simplistic assumptions built into it, many of
which might legitimately be challenged. For what is is worth, the model suggests that,
when a project is a tail-hedged investment, what might better be combined in a betaweighted average at time t are not the two focal discount rates re and rf , but rather their
23

Gollier (2012b) attempts some rough calculations but I am not sure I agree with the results because the
procedure is based on the implicit premise that damages are multiplicative in actual realizations of stochastic
consumption, which practically guarantees a high value of .

two corresponding discount factors exp( re t) and exp( rf t), via the formula exp( rt t) =
(1 ) exp( rf t)+ exp( re t). This implies a time-dependent discount rate rt that declines
over time from the initial CAPM value r0 = (1
) rf + re down to the asymptotic value
r1 = rf . Even if is not known exactly, it is still useful to understand how its riskadjustment role might be conceptualized.
The paper explains how the declining schedule of risk-adjusted discount rates re‡ects the
increasing relative value of having insurance against the increasingly likely possibility over
time of disastrous outcomes.
Because there is such a signi…cant equity-premium di¤erence between discount rates of
re =7% and rf =1% per year, there is an enormous discrepancy between the corresponding
discount factors for time spans of a century or more. Other things being equal, this implies
a relatively rapid decline of rt and leads to the main empirical implication of the paper.
The standard practice of incorporating risk adjustments by modifying a constant discount
rate may have the potential for signi…cantly biasing CBA against long-term tail-hedged
investments whose real-project beta is less than one.
Finally, this paper is suggesting the importance of a research agenda that might put
more e¤ort into determining – if only very roughly and “on average” – the real projectspeci…c betas for long-term public investments. Climate change in general, and the SCC in
particular, leap to mind as obvious applications wanting further attention.
