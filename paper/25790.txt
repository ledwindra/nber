ABSTRACT
Are financial crises a negative shock to demand or a negative shock to supply? This is a
fundamental question for both macroeconomics researchers and those involved in real-time
policymaking, and in both cases the question has become much more urgent in the aftermath of
the recent financial crisis. Arguments for monetary and fiscal stimulus usually interpret such
events as demand-side shortfalls. Conversely, arguments for tax cuts and structural reform often
proceed from supply-side frictions. Resolving the question requires models capable of admitting
both mechanisms, and empirical tests that can tell them apart. We develop a simple small open
economy model, where a country is subject to deleveraging shocks that impose binding credit
constraints on households and/or firms. These financial crisis events leave distinct statistical
signatures in the empirical time series record, and they divide sharply between each type of
shock. Household deleveraging shocks are mainly demand shocks, contract imports, leave
exports largely unchanged, and depreciate the real exchange rate. Firm deleveraging shocks are
mainly supply shocks, contract exports, leave imports largely unchanged, and appreciate the real
exchange rate. To test these predictions, we compile the largest possible crossed dataset of 200+
years of trade flow data and event dates for almost 200 financial crises in a wide sample of
countries. Empirical analysis reveals a clear picture: after a financial crisis event we find the
dominant pattern to be that imports contract, exports hold steady or even rise, and the real
exchange rate depreciates. History shows that, on average, financial crises are very clearly a
negative shock to demand.

Introduction

What is the link between financial crises and trade collapses, and what can macroeconomists
learn from it? In this paper we look to the past, exploring evidence from up to 200 years of
international trade and price data to answer this question. Our historical long-run approach
is unique, differs from existing studies, and opens up potential new avenues for research.
In particular, we want to ask a very general question: are financial crises, on average,
associated with a negative shock to demand or a negative shock to supply? This is an
important question to answer, because it can help guide better policy responses to future
financial crises. Arguably, had we known more in 2008, it might have made for a clearer
answer as to what was to blame for the Great Recession, and, thus, helped in the search
for effective policy responses. In real time, clarity was lacking: many economists and
policymakers sided with a demand shock explanation, but others argued the problem was
on the supply side. Yet there were few evidence-based arguments based on similar events
in the past. We show that the historical record might have cast some light and cut through
the intellectual and political fog.
In the first part of our paper we develop a simple small open economy model, where
the home country is subject to deleveraging shocks. The new theoretical contribution is
that these shocks can impose binding credit constraints either on households or on firms,
or both. Our model builds on the work of Eggertsson and Krugman (2012)—in which
households adjust to sudden deleveraging shocks—by adding an analogous shock to firms
and by extending the framework to an open economy setting including a nontradable sector
and an endogenous real exchange rate. In the simulations of the model, we treat financial
crisis events as household or firm deleveraging shocks, and ask what kind of statistical
signatures each kind of event would leave in the empirical time series record.
The answers are very clear, and divide sharply between each type of shock. Household
deleveraging shocks, setting aside second order equilibrium effects, are pure demand
shocks; these will tend to contract imports, leave exports largely unchanged, and depreciate
the real exchange rate. Firm deleveraging shocks, setting aside second order equilibrium
effects, are pure supply shocks; these will tend to contract exports, leave imports largely
unchanged, and appreciate the real exchange rate. These clear contrasts in the model
predictions help us take the theory to the data.
In the second part of our paper we present our empirical evidence. The rationale for a
long time frame is that financial crises are relatively rare events. To say anything meaningful
from a statistical standpoint, we must expand our data across countries, and back in time,
as recent research has shown (Reinhart and Rogoff, 2009, 2011; Schularick and Taylor, 2012).

Our analysis centers on a substantial effort to assemble a new large historical dataset.
In particular we extend and then match two types of datasets, historical bilateral data on
trade flows, and country-specific data on macroeconomic aggregates and financial crisis
dates. With that done, we can look over a universe of almost 200 financial crises, and use
empirical methods to get a clearer picture of how financial distress typically affects trade.
What does history show? When we look at the long-run trade and price data, match
them with established financial crisis timings, and trace out the high frequency responses,
do we find that financial crises exhibit the symptoms of demand shocks or supply shocks?
The answer will turn out to be strikingly unambiguous.
Very clearly, after a financial crisis event we see statistical evidence strongly in favor of
the demand-side view: on impact, imports contract, exports hold steady or even rise, and
the real exchange rate depreciates. All effects are statistically significant, and especially so
in the bilateral data where the sample size exceeds 150,000 country pair-year observations
for trade flows and real exchange rates. The effects persist out to a five year horizon.
Our results form part of an emerging view that household debt and deleveraging cycles
play a highly influential role in economic fluctuations (Jorda, Schularick, and Taylor, 2013;
Mian, Sufi, and Verner, 2017), but one novel contribution here is to bring evidence on
international adjustment into the debate as an extra tool for validation.
We also dig deeper than just a single aggregate response. In both theory and empirics,
rather than study only the effects on final goods, we further distinguish between trade
in final goods and trade in intermediate inputs. In our model, household deleveraging
shocks reduce the demand for imported final goods. In addition, households demand
fewer non-traded goods, which causes firms to import fewer intermediate inputs. In the
case of firm deleveraging shocks, which limit production, imports of intermediate inputs
fall, whereas imports of final goods are largely stable. We construct data on trade flows by
product type for the post-WW2 period, and find that financial crises depress imports of
both final and intermediate goods, providing further empirical evidence consistent with
the demand-side view of crises.
Our empirical results are quite stable across developed and developing countries, with
the difference that the decline in imports is deeper following financial crises in the latter.
Since our data spans two centuries, we also ask whether financial crises in different eras
have had different consequences over time. The answer is no; while we lose some precision
in our pre-WW2 estimates, in part due to a smaller sample size, qualitatively the response
of trade flows and prices is fairly stable across different eras.
In addition, though we initially treat financial crises as exogenous events, we later allow
for the possibility that these are endogenous to macroeconomic conditions. Following Jordà,

2

Schularick, and Taylor (2011) and Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2016) we use the method of
inverse propensity-score weighting to address the problem of bias arising from selection on
observables. Following Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2011) we use pre-crisis credit growth
as a predictor of financial crises in our first stage. Reassuringly, all of our results remain
valid when we model crises as endogenous events in this way.
We also acknowledge that economies are exposed to various types of crises in addition
to financial ones. Consequently, we extend our dataset with the dates of currency and
inflation crises, stock market crises, and external and domestic sovereign debt crises, relying
on the benchmark timings provided by Reinhart and Rogoff (2011). Our results are robust
to jointly controlling for all these other kinds of crises.
Gaps in our knowledge exposed by the recent crisis have encouraged a return to
economic history to evaluate broad questions using a larger universe of data, allowing us to
accumulate better evidence on how crises affect the macroeconomy. In this paper, we find
that clearly, over the long sweep of history, the dominant effects of a financial crisis event
have corresponded to the theoretical predictions of a demand shock, not a supply shock, as
judged by the evidence left in the time series data for trade flows and real exchange rates.

1.1.

Contribution to the Literature

Our focus on trade takes off from an emerging literature following the 2008 financial crisis.
A wave of studies attests to the interest in the study of the repercussion of financial crises
for exports and imports in an open economy. Most of this work seeks to establish the
reasons behind the observed collapse of international trade. Some have focused on direct
financial effects on certain sectors or firms (Chor and Manova, 2012; Amiti and Weinstein,
2011; Iacovone and Zavacka, 2009; Abiad, Mishra, and Topalova, 2014).1
Another suggestion is that international trade in inputs is subject to greater fixed
costs of shipments; fixed costs induce periodic ordering, but wait-and-see might postpone
trades when a supply shock hits the input importer (Alessandria, Kaboski, and Midrigan,
2010). Part of the trade collapse could be a composition effect, since international trade is
dominated so much by durable goods and intermediate inputs, and these are much more
1 Two

papers examine the response of trade flows to crises over the past recent decades. Iacovone and
Zavacka (2009) study the response of exports to credit conditions in 23 crises episodes during 1980–2006.
Abiad, Mishra, and Topalova (2014) study the impact of both financial and sovereign debt crises during
1970–2009 on imports and exports, finding that crises primarily depress imports. Our approach builds on
but differs substantially from this work. The main difference is in our goal. Our empirical findings and our
model work together to answer the key question in our paper: are financial crises demand or supply shocks?
Second, we expand the time horizon fivefold. As argued earlier, we study only large financial crises which
are rare events. In addition, we focus not only on international trade flows but also on prices to distinguish
the demand versus supply shock explanations.

cyclical than GDP itself (Levchenko, Lewis, and Tesar, 2010; Eaton, Kortum, Neiman, and
Romalis, 2016; Behrens, Corcos, and Mion, 2013; Bussière, Callegari, Ghironi, Sestieri, and
Yamano, 2013). Finally, increases in uncertainty, often associated with financial crisis events,
may trigger a disproportionate decline in imports relative to domestic non-traded activity
due to the interplay between the fixed costs of trade and the option value of waiting to
place an order for shipment (Novy and Taylor, 2014).2
These and other explanations may or may not be shown to be mutually exclusive in
the end. Our contribution to this literature is to develop a simple model that admits both
demand and supply shocks and provides very clear, distinct predictions for the responses
of international trade flows and prices under each type of shock. Our theory departs from
standard trade models by adapting recent intertemporal models of deleveraging shocks
to an open economy setting. Our model’s predictions can be told apart very cleanly upon
examining the data. Our interest is not in the response of the economy to a single crisis
episode but in the average response to nearly 200 episodes over the past two centuries.
This paper also contributes to a literature documenting the causes and consequences
of financial crises (Reinhart, 2010; Reinhart and Rogoff, 2011; Schularick and Taylor, 2012;
Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor, 2011). In the same spirit that motivates our paper, this
work has looked at the past, gathering evidence from many financial crisis episodes over
several decades or centuries. These papers have examined the impact of crises on several
macroeconomic outcomes, such as GDP and unemployment, but not on international trade
flows and prices. Much of this literature focuses on documenting the consequences, not the
causes, of financial crises. Work that does ask for causes (such as Schularick and Taylor,
2012) points to the role of credit, but does not seek to answer whether these events should
be understood as demand or supply shocks.
Finally, our work contributes to the recent and growing literature that examines, from
various perspectives, the causes of the recent Great Recession. In particular, Mian, Rao, and
Sufi (2013) find a large contraction in household spending in the U.S. as a consequence
of declining housing net worth; Mian and Sufi (2014) establish that this led in turn to a
large decline in employment; Mian, Sufi, and Verner (2017) provide global evidence of
the same character. These and other findings based on recent data are consistent with the
demand-side view that our long-run historical evidence strongly support.
2 These

and other explanations are gathered in Baldwin (2009). Further empirical work on crises and trade
includes Freund (2009) who examines the response of trade to global downturns; and Bems, Johnson, and Yi
(2011) who study the role of vertical linkages in amplifying the trade collapse.

A Crisis-Deleveraging Model: Demand, Supply, and Trade Shocks

2.

We study a small open economy and introduce borrowing limits into both the firm and
household side of the economy. This is guided by our desire to understand whether the
macroeconomic effects of financial crises can be best understood as demand or supply
shocks. In the case of households, this apparatus exactly mirrors the approach of Eggertsson
and Krugman (2012).3 We add the same apparatus to the firm side of the model to make
our modeling of the two shocks conceptually as simple and symmetric as possible.
Formally, we will describe an economy populated by patient and impatient households.
These households derive utility from the consumption of an import good and a non-traded
good. Firms in the economy produce a non-traded good sold locally and an export good
sold abroad. They produce using labor and imported inputs and must borrow to finance
a share of their production cost in advance. Both impatient households and firms face
exogenous, binding borrowing limits, and we study the impact on the economy of sudden
declines in the amount that households or firms can borrow.

i a household’s
and time preference parameters such that βs > βb . We denote by CiM and CN

consumption of the import good and the non-traded good, respectively. The household
budget constraint supposes that they receive income as a wage for labor supplied to local
firms in the non-traded and export sectors. In addition, patient households (only) own and
receive firm profits.4
The economy faces an exogenous world price of the import good, PM , and an endogenously determined price of the non-traded good, PN . Households borrow from, or lend to,
the rest of the world at an exogenous real interest rate r, subject to limits.
3 In

related work Benigno and Romei (2014) study how debt deleveraging in one country spreads to the
rest of the world economy.
4 The assumption that only patient households receive firm profits is for analytical simplicity and follows
Martinez and Philippon (2014).

2.2.

Production

We assume that in both the export and the non-traded sectors there is a continuum of
firms of measure one that produce output using labor and imported inputs. Firms in the
export sector sell their goods to the rest of the world at the exogenous world price PX ,
while firms in the non-traded sector sell their good domestically at a price PN determined
in equilibrium. Inputs are traded at the exogenous world price PI .
In each sector, firms must borrow a fraction λ of their cost to finance production. Firms
borrow from the rest of the world at an exogenous real interest rate r, subject to limits.
We assume that in each sector S e { N, X } the firms’ budget constraint is given by
bS t + δS t = δS t−1 · (1 + rt−1 ) + πS t ,
π
where δS t is the amount borrowed in period t, πS t denotes profits paid to households, and
bS t denotes profits excluding the financing cost (revenue minus production cost). When
π
simulating a firm deleveraging shock, we impose a binding limit δS on the amount firms
can borrow and that will be tightened suddenly by the shock.
Firms have the following generalized CES production function:

with e < 1, which implies decreasing returns to scale.5

decreasing returns to scale in the production function will allow both quantities and prices to

Equilibrium

In equilibrium the non-traded goods market clears, determining its price PN , where the
condition for demand equals supply is given by
χ · csN t + (1 − χ) · cbN t = q N t .
Finally, we assume wages evolve according to the following Phillips curve,
wt = wt−1 · (1 + κ · ( Nt − Nss )) .
This assumption follows Martinez and Philippon (2014). We denote by Nss the steady state
level of aggregate hours. The parameter κ regulates the speed of adjustment of wages,
which is proportional to the deviation of aggregate hours from steady state. Wages are
sticky, but in the limit κ → ∞ the economy converges to one with flexible wages. Under
sticky wages, shocks can lead to an excess supply of labor (unemployment) in which the
equilibrium is demand-determined. Following Martinez and Philippon (2014) we ration
the labor market uniformly between the patient and impatient households.

2.4.

Calibration

A first set of parameters is chosen directly based on the literature. Following Eggertsson
and Krugman (2012) and Martin and Philippon (2017) we assume half the households are
constrained (χ = 0.5). We assign a value 0.04 to the real interest rate, and set the discount
factor of patient households such that βs = 1/(1 + r ). We set the slope of the Phillips curve
κ = 0.1 and the inverse elasticity of labor supply φ is set to 1 as in Monacelli (2009). We
assume the fraction of firms’ cost that must be financed before production takes place λ is
set to 1/3. We assume values for the parameters of the production function ρ = 0.5, θ = 0.7,
7

·

and e = 0.5, and we verify that simulation results do not change significantly as these
parameters vary.
The remaining parameters are the price of the export good (PX ), the price of the import
good (PM ), the price of the imported input (PI ), the relative weight of the nontraded good
in the utility function (α N ), and the borrowing limit for impatient households (D). These
parameters are set to target the following conditions in the initial steady-state. First, we
set the trade balance equal to zero, the share of inputs in total imports equal to either 10%
or 40%, and the price of the import good and the export good equal.6 Second, we set the
employment share of the nontraded sector to either 60% or 80% of employment.7 Third, we
set the debt to income ratio of impatient households equal to one, an assumption which
follows Eggertsson and Krugman (2012).
Finally, in each sector the borrowing limit for firms (δS ) is set to be just below the
optimal amount borrowed in the unrestricted steady state.

2.5.

Simulations

The goal of the model is to permit us to simulate the responses of the economy to deleveraging shocks to households and firms.
Demand shock We interpret a decline in the borrowing limit for impatient households as
a demand shock.8 All else equal, such households are forced to spend less on consumption,
given their reduced ability to borrow. On impact, they reduce their consumption as they
borrow a now lower amount but still repay a higher amount borrowed in the previous
period. This reduces demand for both the imported final good and the non-traded good,
leading to lower aggregate demand. In response, the price of the non-traded good falls.
Firms in the non-traded sector adjust their production, lowering their demand for the
intermediate input. Lower demand for both the imported final good and the intermediate
input leads to lower imports. Exports vary only due to general equilibrium effects, as
world demand is unchanged. We simulate the response to two types of shocks to impatient
households’ borrowing limit.
Figure 1 graphs the adjustment of exports, imports of the final good, the intermediate
input, and total imports, the trade balance, and the price of the non-traded good in response
to each of these shocks. The first shock, shown in panel A, is an unanticipated permanent
6 While

we do not have accurate historical data informing an average value of the share of imported inputs
in total imports over our sample period, we believe these two values represent a reasonable range.
7 Again, we do not have historical data describing the size of the nontradable sector, so we use a reasonable
range of parameters.
8 When simulating this household deleveraging shock, we allow firms to borrow freely.

decline in the borrowing limit. Given the fall in GDP, the ratio of exports to GDP rises while
imports to GDP fall, as imports fall further than GDP. Imports of both the final good and
the intermediate input fall. The trade balance rises in response to the decline in imports.
The price of the non-traded good falls.
The second shock, in panel B of Figure 1, is an unanticipated gradual decline and subsequent recovery in the borrowing limit, representing a more realistic multi-year financial
crisis. This generates similar paths for exports, imports and the price of the non-traded
good during the decline in the borrowing limit. All these series, however, recover and
“overshoot” beyond the initial level as the borrowing limit returns to the original. The
reason is that as the borrowing limit falls, constrained households are re-paying higher
levels of past (one-period) debt than they can currently borrow (i.e., refinance), which
reduces their consumption. But as the borrowing limit increases, the opposite happens,
leading to an increase in their consumption.
Supply shock In turn, we interpret a decline in the borrowing limit for firms as a supply
shock. All else equal, every firm is forced to produce less output from less input, given their
reduced ability to borrow.
The immediate impact is to reduce the production of both the export good and the
non-traded good, as firms in both sectors face a tighter borrowing constraint. Exports fall
directly due to the shock. Further, the price of the non-traded good rises due to a decline in
supply. A lower amount of credit to produce leads to a lower demand for the imported
input by both the export and the non-traded sectors. The shock also lowers wages and
firm profits in both sectors. This leads to lower income to both patient and impatient
households. Patient households are able to smooth the impact of the shock over time, with
a minor decline in demand, but impatient households cannot borrow and translate their
lower income fully into lower consumption. The ratio of imports of final goods to GDP
rises as the fall in GDP is larger than the fall in imports. Total imports to GDP rise, as the
rise in final goods to GDP dominates the decline in imported inputs to GDP.
Figure 2 illustrates the adjustment in response to this type of shock. As before, we
simulate the economy’s adjustment to both an unanticipated permanent decline in the
firms’ borrowing limit (in panel A) and an unanticipated gradual decline and subsequent
recovery in the borrowing limit (in panel B). As with the shock to households, the gradual
firm deleveraging shock in panel B generates an “overshooting” in all outcomes.
Robustness We analyze these simulations varying two important steady-state ratios used
to calibrate the model’s parameters: the share of imported intermediate inputs in total
imports and the size (employment share) of the nontradable sector. As we show and
11

discuss in detail in Appendix B, our results are robust to using a wide range of calibrated
parameters.

Data: Trade and Financial Crises over Two Centuries

The dataset used in this paper includes 69 developed and developing countries and covers
the period 1816–2014. We combine bilateral trade flows between all country pairs with data
on financial crises, GDP, and bilateral real exchange rates. We have also included in the
dataset information on bilateral trade barriers as used in typical gravity models of trade.
Our dataset is assembled gathering several data sources which we describe below.

3.1.

Financial Crisis Dates

We rely on data on the dates of financial (i.e., banking) crises compiled by Reinhart and
Rogoff (2011). They define banking crises as episodes where bank runs lead to the public
sector assuming control of financial institutions, and/or episodes of large-scale financial
assistance from the govermnment to financial institutions. These data are available for 70
countries.9,10 Reinhart and Rogoff (2011) mark financial crisis dates using dummy variables
at an annual frequency. We identify the first year of a crisis as the relevant shock event. We
exclude crises adjacent to major world wars, or around which we lack trade data. We thus
can analyze a maximum of 195 crisis episodes in our historical window. In this sample, 77
crises take place in advanced countries and 118 in developing economies; 108 crises occur
in the post-WW2 period and 87 in the pre-WW2 era.11 The distribution of the number of
crisis episodes by country is such that the median country faces 3 crisis episodes during
the full sample window 1816–2014. At the extremes, the country at the 10th percentile faces
a single financial crisis episode, while the country at the 90th percentile faces 6 crises over
the two centuries. Figure A.1 in the Appendix illustrates the frequency of financial crises
by year.

Bilateral and Total Trade Flows

Bilateral trade data were obtained from the newly available CEPII TRADHIST database
for the pre-WW2 period and entirely from the IMF’s Direction of Trade Statistics for the

Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United
Kingdom and the United States.

using the U.S. GDP deflator.
We also assemble a second dataset on country-level total exports, total imports, GDP,
and financial crises over the same period and sample of countries to provide more aggregate
evidence on the response of trade following crises.
Trade in Final Goods and Intermediate Inputs We also construct a dataset of bilateral
trade flows by product type spanning the period 1962–2014. These data are restricted
to the post-WW2 period as product-level data are not systematically available for earlier
decades. Broadly, our procedure involves obtaining data by product, by year, and by
exporter-importer pair from the United Nations’ COMTRADE database and assigning each
individual product into final goods, intermediate inputs, or capital goods categories. The
coding of products into these aggregate groups is standard and follows Hummels, Ishii,
and Yi (2001).13 We exclude from our data fuels, which at times represent a relevant share
of world trade, and a small set of unmatched products.

3.3.

GDP and Real Exchange Rates

Our historical GDP series are assembled from various sources. Whenever possible we
obtain real GDP series from Glick and Taylor (2010) and from Maddison (1995, 2001). In
recent years, we use the World Bank’s World Development Indicators database. To fill in gaps
in the early years in our sample we also use Barro and Ursua (2008) and Mitchell (1992,
1993, 1995).
We also construct measures of bilateral real exchange rates. We obtain nominal exchange
rates from the IMF’s International Financial Statistics for the post-1950 period and from Global
Financial Data for the pre-WW2 period. We obtain series on price levels from Reinhart and
Rogoff (2011) for most of our sample, and from the IMF’s World Economic Outlook for very
recent years.

3.4.

World Trade and Major Crises

To motivate our analysis, we note that what was witnessed after the global financial crisis
in 2008 was nothing new, especially not the so-called Great Trade Collapse, meaning the
12 The

CEPII TRADHIST project has extended substantially the amount of pre-WW2 data available in earlier
datasets, adding years further into the past and filling in many gaps. Existing research examining historical
trade flows typically have a starting point of 1870. For details on the construction of see CEPII TRADHIST
database see Fouquin and Hugot (2016).
13 We match SITC revision 1 product codes in COMTRADE to BEC codes used by Hummels, Ishii, and Yi
(2001) using a concordance obtained from the United Nations’ Statistics Division.

fall in trade volumes relative to GDP.
Figure 3 shows the trajectory of world exports/GDP after all the major global financial
crises between 1827 and the present. We aggregate total exports and GDP over this period
for a constant set of countries. This limits our world-trade figure to 10 countries with
continuously available trade and GDP data over the 1827–2014 period. We exclude years of
world wars in which trade or GDP data are missing for many countries. Figure A.8 in the
Appendix shows the results are very similar based on a broader group of 20 countries over
the period 1868–2014.
From this graph, the trade collapse following the recent 2008–2009 financial crisis is
unsurprising. Our figure also shows, with vertical dashed lines, the starting dates of the
Panic of 1873 episode, the 1930s Great Depression episode, the 1980s LDC SovereignFinancial Crises episode, and the 2008 Great Recession episode. Similar declines in world
trade can be seen to have occurred after each of these crisis events. Two years following
16

the start of the Great Recession in 2008, world exports to GDP in our data had fallen by
0.93 percentage points. This is a similar decline to that in the early 1980s, when the trade to
GDP fell ratio fell by 0.86 percentage points. The impact of the Great Depression, however,
was almost twice as large, with a 1.45 percentage point fall in world trade to GDP.
However, the recovery of trade after the recent “trade collapse” was faster — compared
to output — than that seen in previous episodes. Five years following the start of the Great
Recession the exports-to-GDP ratio was 0.1 percentage points higher than in the year prior
to the start of the crisis, while in the 1980s debt crisis and the Panic of 1873 it was still one
percentage point lower. The Great Depression stands out in this regard. Due perhaps to
rising protectionist measures adopted by the U.S. and other countries during this period
(and other rising frictions, such as the collapse of the gold standard) exports-to-GDP were
still more than 3 percentage points lower than in the year prior to the start of the crisis.
This figure nicely motivates our study by revealing an enduring link between crisis
events and trade outcomes. What is obscured in this figure, however, is the uneven impact
of financial crises on imports and exports, and the correlation between those shocks and
the location of the underlying financial frictions. The next sections focus on those issues
with a granular empirical analysis.

4.

Response of Total Trade Flows to Financial Crises

Our first empirical exercise examines the evolution of countries’ aggregate exports and
imports following financial crises in our historical 1816–2014 panel. We count 172 such
crisis episodes, a third of which occur in the developed countries in our sample. Reinhart
and Rogoff (2009) and Jorda, Schularick, and Taylor (2013), and others, have documented
the deep impact of crisis episodes on various outcomes such as output, unemployment,
and government debt, and the pace of recovery. With the same historical perspective, we
will focus on international trade.
Formally, let ln Tit denote a trade flow, which will be either total exports (Xit ) or total
imports (Mit ) for country i in year t, measured in real constant dollars. In the same
units we also measure GDP, denoted Yit . Imposing a benchmark unit trade elasticity (i.e.,
homotheticity, as in standard gravity models) with respect to country GDP, we study the
size-normalized trade flow ln( Tit /Yit ). We are interested in the dynamic response of this
object, in the aftermath of a financial crisis event in country i. Thus, we denote by Crisisit
the dummy variable which indicates the start of a financial crisis event. We then trace out
the response of the normalized trade flow from time t to time t + h across all episodes,
using the local projection method of Jordà (2005) and estimating the series of regression for

17

each horizon h
ln( Ti,t+h /Yi,t+h ) − ln( Tit /Yit ) = αih + βht + γh Crisisit + eit ,

(1)

where αih are country fixed effects and βht are year fixed effects. The coefficient of interest is
γh which denotes the response at horizon h to a financial crisis. These coefficients show how,
controlling for pure GDP scaling effects, the financial crisis shock affects trade volumes. The
estimation is by OLS with standard errors clustered by pair and year, and all time-invariant
country characteristics (e.g., certain geographical factors) are absorbed in the fixed effects.
Figure 4 and Table 1 show our estimates for the full sample. We find that on impact a
financial crisis is associated with a decrease in GDP-normalized imports (−4.9% change).14
But we find that on impact a financial crisis is associated with a (not statistically significant)
increase in normalized exports. The effects on imports remain of a similar magnitude and
statistically significant even out to the horizon h = 5 years (−6.0% change), while the effect
on exports remain not statistically different from zero.
Studies of the “trade collapse” during the recent Great Recession document similar
patterns and are motivated by the very large fall in trade in comparison to output. Because
the 2008 event was a global crisis hitting many countries simultaneously, and because a
country’s exports are other countries’ imports, it is difficult to tell apart in this recent episode
whether the crisis depressed imports, exports, or both. Our empirical strategy can make this
distinction, and the results show clearly that crises lower imports. A second message that
emerges is that large decline in imports relative to GDP are the norm historically. Finally,
the historical record indicates that financial crises disrupt trade flows for many years.
We now turn to robstness. If we exclude the Great Recession, as in Figure 5a, the results
are similar to those for the full sample. In the post-WW2 sample (shown in 5b), which
includes 55% of the crisis episodes, the decline in imports relative to GDP is even larger
than in the full sample. On impact, the normalized trade flow declines −5.9% at a two-year
horizon in the full sample and −8.9% in the post-WW2 era. In both cases, normalized
exports rise but the impact is not statistically significant. Our estimates for the pre-WW2
period (in Figure 5c) are blurrier. Imports still fall relative to GDP (−4.1% change) on
impact, but recover faster than in the full sample baseline. Normalized exports climb
susbtantially over time. In both cases, standard errors are wider, due perhaps primarily to
the smaller sample size.15
We also examine the response of exports and imports in developed and developing
14 Strictly,

the units of the estimated coefficients are log points, but for simplicity we refer to them using the
% sign from here onwards as this is a close approximation.

countries separately, as shown in Figures 6a and 6b, respectively.16 We denominate 14
countries in our sample as developed and the remaining 55 as developing. Out of the 195
crisis episodes considered, 39% occur in the developed group, and the remaining 61% in
developing countries. While our main messages outlined earlier largely remain valid for
both samples, we do find some differences. In the developing-country sample, normalized
imports decline more than in the full sample, reaching the largest decline at a two year
horizon (−8.2% change, compared to −5.9% for the full sample). In the developed-country
sample we loose precision, perhaps due to the small number of countries, but the main
message—that imports tend to fall, and exports tend to stay stay constant or rise, relative to

The results above appear inconsistent with the supply-side view of financial crises,
and consistent with the demand-side view of financial crises. However, up to now our
examination of total trade flows does not take into account events in countries’ trading
partners. In the next section we extend this approach to consider bilateral trade flows,
sharpening our identification.

5.

Response of Bilateral Trade Flows to Financial Crises

In this section we take our empirical work to the most granular level possible. We now
consider all country pairs, in all years, and look at the post-crisis response of exports,
imports, and also the real exchange rate, for every given pair-year observation. Not only
will this greatly expand the number of observations, it will also allow us to more exactly
control for the incidence of financial crises potentially affecting one or both trading partners
in any given observation.
As a starting point, we treat crises as exogenous events. Later we will address reverse
causality, that is, the concern that financial crisis episodes might be a “nonrandom treatment”
which is endogenous to macroeconomic conditions.
In new notation for this setting, we now denote by Teit the trade flow from exporter
country e to importer country i in year t, and we denote by Yet and Yit the GDP level in
each country, all measured in real constant dollars. We construct the size-normalized trade
21

5

flow given by ln( Teit /[Yet Yit ]), imposing a unit trade elasticity (homotheticity) with respect
to exporter and importer GDP (again, as in standard gravity models).
We are interested in studying the response of this normalized trade flow following a
financial crisis event in either country e or country i, or both. We denote by Crisiset and
Crisisit the dummy variables indicating the start of a financial crisis event in countries e
and i. We estimate the response of the normalized trade flow from time t to time t + h
across all episodes.
As before, we use the local projection method of Jordà (2005), where now we are
estimating the series of regression for each horizon h

h are country-pair fixed effects and β h are year fixed effects. We also allow for
where αei

additional controls Xeit . Here, the coefficients of interest γeh and γih denote the responses
at horizon h to a financial crisis in the exporter and importer country, respectively. These
coefficients will show how, controlling for GDP scaling effects, the financial crisis shock
impacts trade flows between country pairs. We once again estimate these series of equations
by OLS with standard errors clustered by pair and year. Time-invariant pair characteristics
(e.g., distance or other geographical factors) are absorbed in the fixed effects.
The full sample estimates are shown in Table 2 and in panel (a) of Figure 7. In our
preferred specification we include as additional controls Xeit two lags of the dependent
variable and the change between t + h and t in the real exchange rate (ln RERei,t+h −
ln RERei,t ). In the Appendix (see Table A.4 and panel (a) of Figure A.9) we show that very
similar results are obtained when we ignore these additional controls.17 With about 200,000
observations we can obtain fairly good precision in the estimates. We find that on impact
a financial crisis is associated with a increase in the normalized trade flow, +2.2% change,
when the financial crisis event takes place in the exporter country. But we find that on
impact a financial crisis is associated with a decrease in the normalized trade flow, −6.1%
change, when the financial crisis event takes place in the importer country. The effects
remain of a similar magnitude and are statistically significant even out to the horizon h = 5
years, where the effects are +3.2% and −4.6%.
Like our previous results, these patterns are clearly inconsistent with the supply-side
view of financial crises, but quite consistent with the demand-side view of financial crises.
Next we turn to our model’s predictions for the response of the real exchange rate in
17 Further,

a version of all the results in this section without these additional controls is reported in Appendix

Section E.

The full sample estimates are shown in Table 3 and in panel (b) of Figure 7. In our
preferred specification we include two lags of the dependent variable but omitting these
controls results in similar results as we show in the Appendix (see Table A.5 and panel
(b) of Figure A.9). On impact a financial crisis is associated with an appreciation in the real
exchange rate, +3.3% change, when the financial crisis event takes place in the exporter
country. But on impact a financial crisis is associated with a depreciation in the real exchange

rate, −3.1% change, when the financial crisis event takes place in the importer country.
Even at horizon h = 4 years, the effects are +0.9% and −1.0% and statistically significant.
Again, based on our model, the patterns are clearly inconsistent with the supply-side
view, but quite consistent with the demand-side view of financial crises.
The Post-WW2 Era versus The Pre-WW2 Era. Our dataset spans two centuries, a period
over which there have been many changes in economic regimes and institutions. We wonder,
then, whether the financial-crisis-as-demand-shocks view that emerges from our analysis
so far is valid throughout this long period, or whether different eras are systematically
different in this regard. It seems natural to split our sample into before and after World
War 2, leaving a similar number of crisis episodes in both subsamples. These results
are illustrated by Figure 8.18 In the post-WW2 era, the results are very similar to those
documented earlier for the entire two centuries. During the pre-WW2 period, however, our
estimates for the impact of crises on trade flows lack precision. The results for the RER, on
the other hand, are much the same as those reported earlier.
Advanced versus Developing Economies. We also divide the sample between advanced
and developing economies, with 14 countries in the former group and 55 in the latter.
We report four sets of results, corresponding to: advanced exporter, advanced importer,
developing exporter, and developing importer. Figure 9 shows that the patterns seen earlier
do not differ much across these groups.19 The main difference is a more pronounced
decline in normalized imports when the importer is a developing country instead of an
advanced economy.
Trade in Final Goods versus Trade in Intermediate Inputs. Our model predicts sharply
different responses for both trade in final goods and trade in intermediate inputs depending
on whether a financial crisis is a deleveraging shock to households or firms. Recall our
model predicts a decline in imports of final goods to GDP and imports of intermediate
goods to GDP following a household deleveraging shock. In contrast, a firm deleveraging
shock induces an increase in imports of final goods to GDP and a fall in imports of
intermediate inputs to GDP.
We have assembled data on bilateral trade flows by product type for the post-1962
period, which is described in detail in section 3. We estimate equation 2 using each
component of bilateral trade flows (trade in final goods and trade in intermediate inputs)

have declined by −6.7% compared to −2.6% for trade in inputs, and at a 5-year horizon the decline is −7.6%

Controlling for All Other Types of Crises. The possible coincidence of financial crises
with other types of crisis constitutes a potential challenge to our empirical strategy. We first
ask, then, what is the degree of overlap between financial crises and various other types of
crises. Secondly and more important, we show that extending our regressions to control for
the occurrence of crisis episodes of a different nature leaves our earlier results unscathed.
We obtain data on the dates of various crises types from Reinhart and Rogoff (2011).
This is also the source of our data on financial crises dates used in our analysis so far.
Reinhart and Rogoff (2011) have created a comprehensive historical record coding dates for
currency and inflation crises, stock market crises, and external and domestic sovereign debt
crises. With this data as a starting point, we define the first year of a crisis as the relevant

shock event, in the same way we have defined financial crisis episodes.
How much of an overlap of various crises types within a country is there? One fifth
of our financial crisis events coincide with other crisis events. One half of our financial
crises fall within a 5-year window of other crisis events. This degree of overlap merits
controlling for coincident crisis events in our regressions. We augment our local projections
method that estimates the impact of financial crises on bilateral trade flows or bilateral real
exchange rates, with dummy variables marking the various other types of crises described
above occuring in either the exporting or the importing country.
The results in Figure 11 show our main message remains true.23 Financial crises in
the exporting country increase trade flows, while financial crises in the importing country
decrease trade flows. Bilateral real exchange rates appreciate in response to crises in the
exporter, and depreciate in response to crises in the importer. While we have significantly

expanded the number of regressors, we loose little precision in our estimates.
Controlling for Multilateral Resistance Terms. In standard gravity equations, exclusion
of multilateral resistance terms biases estimates of the elasticity of trade flows to trade
costs (typically captured by distance). While this is not the case here, and we include
exporter-importer fixed effects, it could be possible that changes over time in trade from
flows e to i could depend on changes in GDP in other countries, which could be correlated
with the ocurrence of crises in e or i.
While these effects are probably very small, we control for changes in multilateral
resistance terms of e and i. These multilateral resistance terms can be proxied by countries’
remoteness (Wei (1996), Baldwin and Harrigan (2011)). Following Baldwin and Harrigan
(2011) we define country e’s remoteness as the inverse of the sum of all other countries’

and choose ν = 1. We then estimate equation 2 for bilateral trade including the change over
time in the remoteness of the exporter (Re,t+h − Ret ) and the importer (Ri,t+h − Rit ). The
results, shown in Figure 12, are very similar to our baseline results. For the same reason,
we include these terms in equation 3 for bilateral real exchange rates. Again, results are

Crisis Endogeneity and Inverse Probability Weighting

We address the concern that financial crisis episodes might be endogenous using the method
of inverse probability weighting. This procedure assigns less weight in our bilateral trade
and RER regressions to observations that more likely to occur based on prior macroeconomic
conditions. This correction for selection bias has been discussed in a time series context by
Angrist, Jordà, and Kuersteiner (2018) and applied to the study of financial crises (Jordà,
Schularick, and Taylor, 2011, 2016) and to the study of fiscal policy (Jordà and Taylor, 2016).
To start, we construct a first-stage estimator of the probability that country c has a
financial crisis at time t. As a predictor of crises, we use credit growth over the five-year
period leading to each crisis (between years t − 6 and t − 1). This choice follows Schularick
and Taylor (2012) who show that credit growth is a powerful predictor of financial crises.25
We fit logit models for the probability of experiencing a financial crisis including either
country or country and year fixed effects. A successful predictor will maximize the rate of
true positives and minimize the rate of false positives. A Receiver Operating Characteristic
(ROC) curve reflects the trade-off between these two goals. The AUROC (Area under
the ROC curve) statistic summarizes the predictor’s quality in this regard.26 This statistic
ranges from 0.5 (for a predictor not different than a random guess) to 1 (for a perfect
predictor), and is independent of the cutoff value used to predict an outcome.
We report the first-stage results in Table 4. Column 1 corresponds to the benchmark case
with only country fixed effects, against which we assess the usefulness of credit growth as
a crisis predictor. In column 2 we add credit growth, and in column 3 we add year fixed
effects.
As shown by Schularick and Taylor (2012), positive credit growth has a statistically
significant impact on the probability of experiencing a financial crisis. Further, the AUC
statistic in columns 2 and 3 is higher—and statistically different—than in our benchmark
case in column 1, showing the contribution for credit growth as a financial crisis predictor.
Let us denote by p̂ct the predicted probability that country c experiences a crisis at time
t, and 1 − p̂ct the probability it does not. We construct weights for our bilateral trade and
RER regressions based on these predicted probabilities as follows. We weight observations

25 Credit is measured as domestic credit to GDP from the World Bank’s WDI dataset. Credit data is only
available for our wide sample of developed and developing countries for the post-WW2 period.
26 See Jordà and Taylor (2011) for a detailed explanation of these concepts.

31

We then re-estimate our bilateral trade regression using these weights. As shown in
Table 5, the results are largely unchanged and our main message still holds. For example,
we find (in panel (b)) a similar decrease by −5.1% in the normalized trade flow when the
financial crisis event takes place in the importer country, while we had found a −6.1%
change in the initial, unweighted results. As before, this impact is highly persistent.
Finally, we also repeat the estimation of the bilateral RER equation using IPW in table 6,
also finding results similar to the baseline ones. The weighted results in panel (b) of table 6
show a +2.6% change when the financial crisis event takes place in the exporter country and
a −2.5% change when it hits the importer country, where these impacts are very similar to
the baseline unweighted results of table 3 (a +3.3% change on impact following crises in
the exporter and a −3.1% change on impact following crises in the importer).

Conclusions

We have developed a simple small open economy model, where a country is subject to
“financial crisis” deleveraging shocks that impose tighter borrowing limits on households
and/or firms. These shocks leave distinct statistical signatures in the empirical time series
record, and they divide sharply between each type of shock.
Household deleveraging shocks are mainly demand shocks, contract imports, leave
exports largely unchanged, and depreciate the real exchange rate. Firm deleveraging
shocks are mainly supply shocks, contract exports, leave imports largely unchanged, and
appreciate the real exchange rate. We conjecture that these patterns will hold in a variety
of models with households and/or firms subject to financial frictions of this kind, so the
lesson is more general.
Taking this model to the data, we compiled a crossed dataset of 200+ years of trade data
and dates of almost 200 financial crises in a large sample of countries. We use empirical
methods to get a clearer picture of how financial distress affects trade and relative prices.
Very clearly in the data, we see after a financial crisis event, on impact, that imports
contract, exports hold steady or even rise, and the real exchange rate depreciate, with effects
persisting for five years. The effects are statistically significant: this pattern is the rule, not
the exception.
Based on both price and quantity evidence from the very long run, a robust interpretation
emerges. History shows that on average financial crises are not, for the most part, a supply
shock. Rather, they are very clearly a negative shock to demand.

Simulations: Additional Results

We analyze the following additional simulations varying two important steady-state ratios
used to calibrate the model’s parameters: the share of imported intermediate inputs in total
imports and the size (employment share) of the nontradable sector.
1. Figures 1 and 2 in Main Text:
• Share of Imported Intermediate Inputs in Total Imports = 0.1
• Employment Share of the Nontradable Sector = 0.6
2. Figures A.2 and A.3:
• Share of Imported Intermediate Inputs in Total Imports = 0.1
• Employment Share of the Nontradable Sector = 0.8
3. Figures A.4 and A.5:
• Share of Imported Intermediate Inputs in Total Imports = 0.4
• Employment Share of the Nontradable Sector = 0.6
4. Figures A.6 and A.7:
• Share of Imported Intermediate Inputs in Total Imports = 0.4
• Employment Share of the Nontradable Sector = 0.8

B.1.

Discussion:

Consider first the case of the permanent shocks. When the size of the nontradable sector
increases relative to the benchmark level in the main text (see Figures A.2 and A.3) there
are no changes in the patterns observed.When the share of imported intermediate inputs
in total imports increases relative to the benchmark level (see Figures A.4 and A.5) the
response to the household deleveraging shock is very similar. In the case of the response
to the firm deleveraging shock we see one difference: the ratio of imports to GDP falls in
response to the shock (while it increases in the baseline case in the main text). It is still
the case under both parametrizations that the ratio of imports of final goods to GDP rises,
while the ratio of imports of intermediate inputs to GDP falls. The larger calibrated steady
state share of imports of intermediate inputs to GDP leads to the decline in total imports to
GDP. Importantly, this decline in imports to GDP is substantially smaller than the decline in
exports to GDP. In consequences, in all scenarios, the trade balance to GDP ratio declines in
response to the firm deleveraging shock.
In the case of the temporary shocks, again we find no relevant differences between
the baseline case in the main text and the simulations with alternative parameters in the
response to the household deleveraging shock. In the case of the firm deleveraging shock,
increasing the steady-state share of imported intermediate inputs in total imports or the
share of the nontradable sector leads to a decline in the ratio of imports to GDP during
A-4

the period when the borrowing limit falls. Once again, a key point is that in all cases the
decline in imports to GDP is smaller than the decline in exports to GDP and consequently
the trade balance to GDP ratio declines in response to the firm deleveraging shock in all
scenarios.

Data: Trade and Financial Crises: Additional Figures

Figure 3 in the main text plots the ratio of world exports to GDP based on a constant sample
of 10 countries over the period 1827–2014. Figure A.8 shows that using a larger set of 20
countries for the shorter period 1868–2014, the result is very similar.

This figure is constructed aggregating exports and GDP for a constant sample of the following 20 countries:
Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Denmark, Spain, Finland, France, the United
Kingdom, Greece, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, and the United States. Vertical dashed
lines indicate the starting year of four major world financial crises: the Panic of 1873 episode, the 1930s Great
Depression episode, the 1980s LDC Sovereign-Financial Crises episode, and the 2008 Great Recession episode.

Response of Bilateral Trade Flows to Financial Crises:
Alternative Specification

The preferred specification for equation 2 in the main text includes two lags of the dependent
variable and controls for changes in the real exchange rate, ln RERei,t+h − ln RERei,t . We
show in Table A.4 and the left panel in Figure A.9 the results of estimating this equation
without these controls.
In addition, the preferred specification for equation 3 in the main text includes two
lags of the dependent variable. Table A.5 and the right panel in Figure A.9 the results of
estimating this equation without any controls.
Figures A.10, A.11, A.12, A.13, A.14, and A.15, A.16 replicate all other figures in the
main text without including these controls.
Table A.4: Local projections: response of bilateral trade to financial crisis in exporter or importer
This table shows the response of the level of bilateral GDP-normalized trade ln Tei − ln Ye − ln Yi to financial
crisis in either exporter country e or importer country i. This measures deviations in trade relative to the
scaled economic size of home and foreign, as in the gravity model. See text.
