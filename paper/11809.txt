ABSTRACT
Consumers often benefit from increased competition in differentiated product settings. In this paper
we consider consumer benefits from increased competition in a differentiated product setting: the
spread of non-traditional retail outlets. In this paper we estimate consumer benefits from supercenter
entry and expansion into markets for food. We estimate a discrete choice model for household
shopping choice of supercenters and traditional outlets for food. We have panel data for households
so we can follow their shopping patterns over time and allow for a fixed effect in their shopping
behavior. We find the benefits to be substantial, both in terms of food expenditure and in terms of
overall consumer expenditure. Low income households benefit the most.

Consumer Benefits from Increased Competition in Shopping Outlets:
Measuring the Effect of Wal-Mart
Jerry Hausman and Ephraim Leibtag1

Revised Draft, October 20052
I. Introduction
Consumers often benefit from increased competition in differentiated product
settings. In previous research Hausman (1997a, 1997b, 1999, 2002) has estimated the
increased consumer welfare from the introduction of new brand, e.g. Apple Cinnamon
Cheerios, and new products, e.g. mobile telephones. In this paper we consider consumer
benefits from increased competition in a differentiated product setting: the spread of nontraditional retail outlets. Non-traditional outlets, including supercenters, warehouse club
stores, and mass merchandisers have grown in popularity and nearly doubled their share
of consumer food-at-home expenditures from 1998 to 20033. Within this non-traditional
retail group, supercenters have experienced the largest increase over this time period, but
warehouse club stores and dollar stores have also experienced significant increases in
their share of the consumer food dollar as U.S. consumers attempt to find the best
combination of prices and services at their retailer of choice.
Supercenters are extremely large stores that sell a wide variety of products. They
are differentiated from more traditional shopping outlets that often specialize in a specific
category: supermarkets specialize in selling food, although they carry other products,
while a supercenter will sell food, clothing, prescription drugs, clothing, home office
supplies, and electronic equipment.
These supercenters are new outlets within a given geographic market defined by
household shopping patterns. They originally began in the southern and southwestern
areas of the US.4 Over the past few years they have spread to the central U.S. and they

are now attempting to move into the northeast and west coast areas of the U.S. However,
they have encountered problems in entering markets in these areas, with the restrictions
often created by zoning ordinances.
By far the largest and most controversial of these supercenter outlets is Wal-Mart.
Wal-Mart typically encounters significant opposition from competing outlets and from
labor unions, who often represent workers in these competing outlets.5 Wal-Mart charges
significantly lower prices than traditional outlets. The traditional outlets typically
respond to Wal-Mart entry by decreasing their prices and attempting to reduce wages and
benefits to their unionized workforce. Thus, neither competitive outlets nor their
unionized workforces favor Wal-Mart entry. Indeed, from late 2003 to early 2004, a
protracted work stoppage took place in Los Angeles area supermarkets prior to expected
Wal-Mart entry into the market.
In this paper we estimate consumer benefits from supercenter entry and expansion
into markets for food. We estimate a discrete choice model for household shopping
choice of supercenters and traditional outlets for food. We have panel data for households
so we can follow their shopping patterns over time and allow for a fixed effect in their
shopping behavior. Most households shop at both supercenters and traditional outlets
during the period. Given a model of shopping behavior we estimate the compensating
variation of household from the presence of supercenters. We find the benefits to be
substantial. Thus, while we do not estimate the costs to workers who may receive lower
wages and benefits, we find the effects of supercenter entry and expansion to be
sufficiently large so that overall we find it to be extremely unlikely that the expansion of
supercenters does not confer a significant overall benefit to consumers.

II. Market Description
Over the past decade, non-traditional shopping formats have captured significant
share from traditional grocery stores and conventional supermarkets. P. Little (2004)
describes the two categories of alternative retail outlets as “high-spend” outlets, which are
low price, one-stop shopping destinations, and “low and medium-spend” stores which are

5

Wal-Mart has no unions in the US. It has recently permitted unions in China. A Wal-Mart store in Quebec,
Canada has been involved in a controversy over whether its workers will form a union.

2

mostly convenience stores that serve a “fill-in” role in between trips to the “high-spend”
outlets He includes supercenters (Wal-Mart, Kmart, Meijer, etc.), warehouse clubs
(Sam’s Club, Costco and BJ’s), and mass merchants (Wal-Mart, Kmart, Target, etc.) as
the primary outlets for these “high-spend” expenditures. 6 Using 2003 data, he estimates
that these outlets have 24.8% of food expenditures, with supercenters having 45.6% of the
category. Over the past few years Wal-Mart has become the largest supermarket chain in
the U.S. Wal-Mart, excluding its Sam’s Club, now has supermarket- related revenues
approximately 51% larger than the runner-up Kroger, and larger than Albertsons and
Safeway, the third and fourth largest supermarket chains, combined. Nationwide WalMart has a 14% market share (in 2003), despite not being in a number of regional
markets, and an 18% share when Sam’s Clubs are included. Within the “medium-low
spend” category, Little estimates convenience stores that also sell gasoline as the fastest
growing store type with 85.5% of the 12.4% total share for the category. Little calculates
that total traditional grocery outlets, including conventional supermarkets and superstores
(a larger version of the conventional supermarket), have decreased to a 56.3% dollar share
in 2003. He also forecasts that in 5 years, the “high-spend category” will grow from
24.8% to 31%, with supercenters comprising 54.8% of the total while traditional grocery
outlets decrease from 56.3% to 48.3%. Thus, he expects Wal-Mart to become
increasingly important over the next few years, continuing the trend of change over the
past decade.
Wal-Mart began selling food in 1988 and in 2002 became the largest grocery chain
in the U.S, now larger than Kroger, Albertsons, and Safeway, which are the next largest
supermarket chains. Significant consolidation has occurred in the supermarket industry,
but Wal-Mart continues to grow at a significantly faster rate than these supermarket
chains. The majority of Wal-Mart’s grocery sales arise from its over 1400 (as of April
2004) supercenters which average 180,000 square feet per store and contain both discount
and grocery store items, although it also has some “Neighborhood Market” stores that are
about the size (40,000 sq. feet) of an average supermarket.4 While most of the stores are

Sam’s Club is owned by Wal-Mart.
Wal-Mart management has given guidance that it expects to open between 230-240 new supercenters in 2005 for
an increase of about 16%. See Dow Jones, “Factiva,” April 19, 2004. Morgan Stanley reports that Wal-Mart is
seeking 16%-17% growth in supermarket sales compared with 3% industry growth. See M. Wiltamuth and R.

in the South and Southwest, Wal-Mart is increasingly moving into urban centers with
openings expected in Los Angeles and Chicago, along with other urban areas.7
One possible explanation for the increases in food sales from non-traditional
outlets can be seen in a comparison of CPI and PPI numbers for these food categories.
Over the 10-year period from 1991-2001 margins increased in supermarkets as the price
of food sold at supermarkets grew at approximately twice the rate of the PPI for food.
Over this period the PPI for finished food increased by 13.9% while the CPI for food at
home increased by 27.7% as demonstrated in Figure 1.

The CPI for food at home is the portion of the consumer price index that measures price
change for food items primarily consumed at home most of which is purchased at

Fariborz, “Food Retail,” June 2004. Wal-Mart has grown at a 16% rate over the past three years.

Wal-Mart has sometimes had difficulty in receiving planning approval for its stores. Currently, Wal-Mart has
either no presence or an extremely limited presence in New England, the New York metro area, California, and the
Pacific Northwest. However, its expansion into new areas has proceeded over the past few years.

index which approximates wholesale prices for the majority of supermarket food sales.
While other cost components, e.g. labor costs, enter the cost function of supermarkets,
wage and other inflation was sufficiently lower during the 1991-2001 period that it is very
likely that gross margins (price minus average variable cost) increased significantly
during the 1990s. Indeed, the operating profit margins of the large supermarket chains
demonstrate that gross margins increased.

Note: Source: SEC 10-K filings. Safeway Operating Profit is defined as Sales less Operating and Administrative Expenses. Kroger Operating
Profit is defined as Sales less Costs and Expenses, excluding Net Interest Expense. The strike in Southern California also contributed to the
decline in Safeway's Operating Profit in 2003 and 2004.

Over the period from 1991 to 2001 Kroger’s operating profit margin increased from
3.3% to 4.7%. Over the same period Safeway’s profit margin increased from 3.6% to
7.9%. This increased gross margin presented supercenters, and especially Wal-Mart, an
invitation to enter markets and to expand with their lower than supermarket prices.
8

Because of an incorrect “linking procedure” used by the BLS in computing the CPI, the prices from Wal-Mart and
other supercenters do not affect the CPI when these stores enter new market or expand in existing markets. For a
discussion see Hausman (2003), and Hausman and Leibtag (2004).

5

Despite significant recent research on competition among supermarkets, the importance
of this factor does not seem to have been recognized.
Various studies have demonstrated that food prices at Wal-Mart are 8%-27%
lower than at the large supermarket chains, even after discounts for loyalty card and other
specials are taken into account.9 After entry by Wal-Mart, conventional supermarkets
typically decrease their prices (or do not increase them as much as in non-Wal-Mart
markets) because of the increased competition. Basker (2004) explored the decreased
prices in a market with Wal-Mart present for drug stores, convenience stores, and clothing
stores, but did not discuss the dynamics of entry and expansion nor the consumer benefits
from these market outcomes.
Some previous studies and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics have posited a
“compensating service effect” explanation whereby consumers do not receive benefits
because of inferior service from supercenters. However, this explanation is inconsistent
with the “indirect price effect” that we estimate subsequently, where we find that as
expenditure at supercenters increases in a given market, the prices at traditional
supermarkets decrease. For example, after two Wal-Mart supercenters opened in
Houston, a nearby Kroger’s sales dropped 10%, the Kroger store reduced worker hours
by 30%-40%, and it decreased its prices.10 Presumably this price decrease is caused by
greater competition. We would expect this indirect price effect in a model of
differentiated shopping outlet competition. For a related problem see Hausman and
Leonard (2002) which finds an indirect price effect and test for its consistency with a
Nash-Bertrand model of competition among competing differentiated bath tissue
products.
Thus, consumers demonstrate with their expenditure choices that they prefer lower
priced outlets, and the higher priced supermarket must respond in a competitive manner.
Consumers benefit both from the “direct price effect” of lower prices at supercenters and

A December 2003 study by UBS Investment Research found a price gap of 17.3% to 26.2%, “Price Gap Tightens,
Competition Looks Hot Hot Hot.” The previous year UBS found a price gap of 20.8% to 39.1%. For example for a
specified identical market basket UBS finds Wal-Mart supercenters to have an average price 19.1% less expensive
in Tampa and 22.8% less expensive in Las Vegas. In 2002, Salomon Smith Barney estimated the price gap to be
between 5% and 25%. See L. Cartwright, “Empty Baskets, September 12, 2002.

made us look at ourselves and reinvent ourselves.”

the “indirect price effect” of lower prices at competing outlets due to the entry and
expansion of supercenters. We measure the consumer welfare effects of both the direct
price effect and indirect price effect in our empirical results.

III. A Utility-Consistent Economic Model of Shopping Destination
Households choose among differentiated shopping outlets by trading off prices
and other shopping costs with quality and convenience. While the goods purchased are
often physically the same, e.g. a 12 ounce box of Cheerios, prices are typically lower at
supercenters but the service quality may be lower and the checkout lines may be longer.11
However, the assumption of a totally offsetting compensating service differential is
inconsistent with real world market behavior that finds when Wal-Mart opens a store in a
new geographic market, it rapidly gains share while conventional supermarkets lose
share.12 Some consumers find the choice to be superior while others continue to shop at
conventional supermarkets.13 Thus, the arrival of Wal-Mart in a given geographic market
is similar to the introduction of a new differentiated good into the geographic market.
The effect on consumers is similar to previous research by Hausman (1997a, 1997b,
1999) and Hausman and Leonard (2002) since consumers now have increased choice in
their shopping trip destinations.
For our economic model we consider the conditional choice of consumers to shop
at either a conventional supermarket or at a lower price, and perhaps lower service
quality, supercenter. For ease of exposition, we use a two-stage choice model in which at
the lower stage the consumer considers his or her shopping behavior conditional on type
of store. The consumer calculates a price index for shopping at either type of store, takes
account of service and other quality differences, and then at the upper stage decides
11

Personal experiences are often a dangerous guide to market outcomes. Nevertheless, in my limited experience in
supermarkets and supercenters I have not found the service better or the checkout lines shorter in supermarkets on
average.
12
Supermarket chains sometimes exit a geographic market after Wal-Mart enters. Albertsons exited the Houston
market after Wal-Mart entry. However, in our model we assume that consumers continue to have access to
traditional supermarkets, even if a given chain exits the market.
13
As we discussed above, these conventional supermarkets typically decrease price because of the increased
competition from Wal-Mart. If the BLS consistently applied its “quality adjustment” procedure it would ignore
these price decreases at conventional supermarkets because presumably they arise from reduced service quality.
However, the BLS fully incorporates these price decreases, demonstrating that its approach is based on no correct
economic assumptions.

which type of store to shop at. Because of the stochastic term in the choice decision,
many consumers can be expected to shop at both types of stores during a period. We use
the two-stage approach of Hausman (1985) and Hausman, Leonard and McFadden
(1995), although neither of the models was designed precisely for the situation of
shopping destination choice.
We allow for consumers choice of shopping at either a conventional supermarket,
j=1, or at a supercenter, j=2. Conditional on choosing to shop at one of these two types of
stores the consumer has a conditional expenditure function
y = e( p0, p1 , p 2 ,..., p n ; u ) = e( p, u ) solves min ∑ p i xi such that u ( x) = u

denoted by the superscript j, and u is the utility level of the consumer.14 The conditional

(3.2)

where the indirect utility function v(p,y) is derived from the duality relationship with the
expenditure function. Using duality corresponding to any level of utility in equation (3.1)
and any vector of prices, a price index exists that corresponds to the minimum
expenditure required to achieve a given level of utility u . Indeed, the utility consistent
price index is the level of expenditure needed to achieve the utility level:

Π ( p j , u ) = e( p j , u ) = y j ( p j , u ) = y j = ∑ p i x i

As written, equation (3.1) assumes that both types of stores carry all goods. To the extent that supermarkets carry
a wider variety of products that supercenters, the prices for supercenters can be entered as virtual prices that set
demand to zero. See Hausman (1997) for an explanation of virtual prices.

8

An “average price” p j can then be calculated by dividing y j by a quantity index x j so
that y j = p j x j . 15
We now move to the top level where the consumer decides whether to shop at the
conventional supermarket or at the supercenter outlet. We expect y 1 > y 2 because most
prices in supermarkets exceed the prices in supercenters. Consider the use of a binomial
choice model for choice between traditional supermarkets and supercenters.16 We specify
the model with a household fixed effect that controls for household characteristics. The
probability of household i in choosing the traditional supermarket is:
pr ( j = 1) = pr (U i1 > U i 2 ) = α i + ( X i1 − X i 2 ) β + ε i1 − ε i 2

(3.4)

where α i is the household fixed effect, Xij are the attributes of choice j for household i,
and ε ij are the stochastic disturbances. Letting the stochastic disturbances be extreme
value, we derive the binomial logit model with fixed effects used by Andersen (1973) and
Cox (1978):

pr ( j = 1) =

1
1 + exp(α i + β 1 ( p 1 − p 2 ))

(3.5)

where a log price index or other type of price index (e.g. a Stone price index) can also be
used depending on the precise form of the underlying expenditure (utility) and demand
functions in equation (3.1) and (3.2).17
IV. Data Description

This study uses a customized subset of the ACNielsen Homescan scanner panel
data for the four years 1998-2001. The ACNielsen Homescan data is a consumer panel
15

Instead of the average price we can also divide expenditure by utility to get a “cost of utils” index.
Because of only two choices, the independence of irrelevant alternative assumption does not create a problem
here. With more than two choices a nested logit or multinomial probit model could be used. See Hausman et. al.
(1995) for a derivation with the nested logit model.

consisting of approximately 61,500 randomly selected households across the U.S. and
includes purchase as well as demographic information for all households in the sample.
Homescan households are randomly recruited to join the panel using sampling techniques
to ensure household representation for demographic variables such as household income,
family composition, education, and household location. Each household is equipped with
an electronic home-scanning unit, and household members record every UPC-coded food
purchase they make by scanning in the UPC of the food products that they buy from all
retail outlets that sell food for home consumption.
The panel is recruited on a permanent basis, subject to turnover from normal
attrition or adjustments to demographic targets necessitated by Census revisions.18 The
Homescan panel is considered by many in the food industry as the most reliable
household based panel data due to its long-standing reputation in the marketplace and its
utilization of hand-held technology that minimizes the recording burden for participants.
The ACNielsen Homescan consumer panel collects consumer shopping and purchase
data from all outlet channels, including grocery, drug, mass and convenience stores. The
panel is geographically dispersed and is demographically balanced so the sample profile
matches the US population as closely as possible. The panel data is also projected to
census estimates that are updated regularly to reflect population changes.
Household panel data allows for observation of the ongoing purchase habits and
practices of household and demographic groups. Tracking and analyzing this
information over time can reveal the dynamics of consumer behavior such as who is
buying what products, what different products are purchased during a given shopping
trip, and how often a product is purchased. Panel data quantifies the composition of
category or brand volume which can be used to measure the impact of store choice on the
purchase level of product quantities and prices. Data are collected after each panelist
shopping trip. Members of the panel record their purchases, capturing not only what is
purchased, but also where the purchase was made, and whether the purchase was a
promotional, sale, or coupon item.

17
18

An exact aggregation approach when using a Gorman generalized polar form appears in Hausman et. al. (1995).
Households lost through attrition are replaced with others having similar key characteristics.

10

These data are useful in price analysis since we are able to observe actual
purchase choices by consumers. However, in terms of food purchase behavior, the key
missing information is consumer purchases of food away from home (primarily
restaurant meals) so one needs to assume that the unknown levels of food away from
home purchases do not somehow bias the average prices paid by an individual household
for their food at home purchases. Once this assumption is made these data are useful for
analysis of the impact of store choice on average prices paid for food at home items.
Consumer panel information can be used to measure the average prices paid by a
representative group of households over time. This measurement of average price paid
can be aggregated across households and/or across time to measure price change for
different categories of products.
Along with the description of each product, the price and quantity that was
purchased is recorded on a daily basis. National and regional level aggregates can be
calculated using transaction data from households located in 50 local U.S. markets as
well as households in non-metro/rural areas that are included in this data set. For 21 of
these 50 markets, a large enough number of panelists are included to enable comparisons
across markets for all UPC-coded products. 19
The Economic Research Service (ERS) of the USDA purchased a sub-sample of
transaction level data from the Fresh Foods Homescan Panel20 comprised of households
that not only recorded their UPC-coded transactions, but also recorded their randomweight (non-UPC coded) food purchases over the year(s) that they participated in the
panel. This sub-sample is used for this study in order to be able measure the entire
market basket of household purchases of food for at-home consumption21. Of this group

20
The Fresh Foods Homescan Panel contained 12,000 households in 1998 and 1999 and was expanded to 15,000
households in 2000 and 2001.
21
If only UPC-coded products were used to measure food-at-home expenditures, many fruit, vegetable, meat, and
poultry purchases would not be recorded in the data and food-at-home expenditure shares by store type would not
accurately measure true household and market expenditure shares. This is especially true in this situation when
alternative channel stores sell less random weight items than conventional retailers. Leaving out random weight
items would then tend to overstate the shares of food expenditures of alternative retail outlets.

11

of 15,000 households per year, the sample was restricted to households that participated
in the panel for at least 10 out of 12 months per year22.
Standard demographic information is collected on an annual basis from each
household and each household’s home market/city and census region is identified for
stratification purposes (see below). Each household is then assigned a projection factor
(weight) based on its demographics in order to aggregate the data to be representative at
the market, regional, and national level. 23
These data were constructed based on a stratified random sample with households
as the primary sampling unit. A stratified random sample is used to ensure that the
sample of households matches Census-based demographic and geographic targets. One
function of the design is to allow description of 8 major markets for cross-market
comparisons. 24
The strata for 1998 and 1999 are based on six cities (Atlanta,
Baltimore/Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and San Antonio) and four
census regions, East, Central, South, and West, for all other households.
ACNielsen augmented their stratification scheme in 2000, selecting 2 additional major
markets (San Antonio and San Francisco), but all other strata remained the same.
There was no known or intentional clustering in the sample construction. The projection
factor (weight) reflects the sample design and demographic distribution within the strata.
The information that is captured on a transaction level basis includes: date of
purchase, store name and channel type identifier25, store department identifier26, item
description, brand name, number of units purchased, price paid,

22

In total, there were 9,501 unique households in the data with some subset participating each year creating a total
of 28,996 household by year observations. In 1998 there were 7,624 households, 7,124 households in 1999, 7,523
households in 2000, and 8,216 households in 2001. Some households participated in the panel for more than one
year. Of the 9,501 households in the data, 5,247 households participated for all four years, 1,877 households
participated for three years, and 2,377 households were one year participants.

promotions/sales/coupons used (if any). For retail stores that ACNielsen tracks with their
store-level scanner data27, prices are verified through store-level price and promotion
checks.
Warehouse shipment data are used to supplement scanner-generated data
collected from households or provided to ACNielsen through their store-level scanner
data. Warehouse shipment data is used to estimate the balance of sales moving through
other food retailers. This information is Census data (i.e., non-projected, actual shipment
data) supplied to ACNielsen by wholesale co-operators.
Some question the quality of household panel data when they try to reconcile it
with store-level scanner data. There is the perception that the volumetric data from each
source should be the same. However, panel data and store data are not always equal
because measurement methodologies differ. Store-level data records millions of
shopping transactions while panel data records a specific group of shoppers. In addition,
panel data only represents household-based purchases, so there are no small businesses or
other institutional purchases included in the panel.
Both types of information have their uses, and by combining the two, one can
quantify the composition of volume, understand the reasons behind consumer behavior
changes, and measure the impact of store choice on average prices. Store-level scanning
data may show that sales were down in a particular store for some group of products in a
given time period. Panel data provide insight into whether the lost volume is due to
fewer buyers or if the existing buyers purchased less at the given store or chain of stores.
Panel data also provide information on which competitors gained the lost expenditures of
the store in question.

V.

Effects on Prices

Our empirical approach first investigates the effect of supercenters, mass
merchandisers, and club stores, (hereafter SMC) on prices paid by households. Two
effects are present. The overall effect is that as more of these superstores operate in a
given geographic market, the average prices paid by households will decrease. Prices for

13

food categories in superstores are typically 5%-48% less than prices for the same product
in supermarkets and other conventional retail outlets. Thus, as a high proportion of
households buy their food at non-traditional retail outlets, the average price paid in a
market will decrease.

A. Price Difference between Supermarkets and Superstores
In Table 5.1 we calculate the ratios of average prices across different types of
outlets for 20 food categories. Column 2 compares the prices for the food categories in
traditional supermarkets compared to prices for these same categories in SMCs (nontraditional stores).

The largest difference in average price was for lettuce where SMC prices were about
50% lower than traditional supermarkets over the 48 month period. Bottled water was
universe are reflected in the sample.
28
We consider products that are mainly “branded” products, e.g. apple juice, cereal, cookies, ice cream, and yogurt
as well as “non-branded” products, e.g. apples, ground beef, lettuce, and tomatoes. We did not find a significant

14

the lowest price difference with SMC prices about 5% less expensive. Soda was the only
item with a lower price in traditional supermarkets than in SMCs. When we take an
average across all of the food categories we find that SMCs have prices that are 27%
lower than traditional supermarkets. We find this difference to be quite large.29
In column 3 of Table 5.1 we compare the price in all non-SMC outlets, including
traditional supermarkets, to the price of these food categories in superstores. We find the
results to be quite similar with the main differences occurring in soda and bottled water.
We find the same overall results that SMC stores offer significantly lower prices than
other retail outlets.
We do not find any indication that SMC stores change (increase) their prices at a
greater or lower rate than traditional supermarkets and other retail outlets. However, we
cannot do the comparison of price changes in equilibrium because as the presence of
SMC stores increases, traditional retail outlets, and most importantly traditional
supermarkets, decrease their prices as a competitive response.

B. Indirect Effects on Prices from Superstores
Another important effect exists from the expansion of SMC stores. Their
increasing presence also increases competition among traditional food retailers. These
supermarkets must decrease prices to remain competitive. The well-publicized strike in
the Los Angeles area in late 2003 through early 2004 when traditional supermarkets
wanted to decrease health benefit for their employees demonstrates the effect that
potential entry of supercenters can have on competition. We call this SMC effect on
traditional supermarkets the indirect price effect. The indirect price effect is consistent
with a Nash-Bertrand model of differentiated shopping outlet with increased competition
arising from entry or expansion of SMCs. Both the overall and indirect price effects lead
to lower average prices for households.
To investigate both the overall and indirect effects on average prices, we do an
econometric analysis using the ACNielsen Homescan data. These data are particularly
useful since they provide household data and allow for a stratified random sample of all
difference in the price ratios between the two categories of products.
29
The estimated difference is in line with stock analyst reports who have previously sampled the difference in prices

15

households. Importantly they provide both price and quantity data across all stores.
Since Wal-Mart and some other large superstores no longer participate in the IRI or
ACNielsen store level data collection, household data collection provide a source of price
and quantity data that are not available elsewhere.
We analyze data at the market level using a fixed effects specification with 48
monthly observations for each market during the period 1998-2001:
pit = α i + δ t + βeit + ε it

i = 1, 34 t = 1, 48

(5.1)

where pit is the average log price paid for a given product, α i is a fixed effect for a
market, δ t is a monthly fixed effect, eit is percentage expenditure for a given product in
superstores, and β is the elasticity coefficient that we estimate. We use market fixed
effects rather than random effects because expenditure in SMC stores is unlikely to be
uncorrelated with the stochastic disturbance, e.g. Hausman (1978). In this situation a
fixed effects estimator yields the efficient estimator. However, we make two further
econometric adjustments. First, expenditure in superstores on a given product may well
not be econometrically pre-determined. Thus, we use instrumental variable estimation
(2SLS) where as the instrument we use the overall proportion of food expenditure in
SMC stores in a given market as the instrumental variable. Since the left hand side
variable in equation (5.1) is expenditure on a given product while the instrumental
variable is expenditure across all products, so that a given product is an extremely low
percentage of overall expenditure, the instrumental variable should not be correlated with
the stochastic disturbance, especially after fixed effects are taken into account. Also, we
use an autoregressive model for the stochastic disturbance (AR1) to capture the time
series aspect of the data and to achieve more efficient estimates. However, least squares
with robust standard errors leads to quite similar results.

over a very few markets.

16

For our econometric investigation of 20 food products we use 34 markets30, each
with over 12,000 food transactions per year. For each of these markets we standardized
purchases on a physical unit measure and estimated the effect of increasing purchases in
SMC stores. Since we have fixed effects for each market, persistent cost and price
differences should be take account of as well as seasonal effects given the presence of
monthly fixed effects. We give the econometric estimates for these 20 food categories
across the 34 markets in Table 5.2:

All of the estimated elasticity coefficients are negative as expected. Thus as households
spend increasing amounts of expenditure at SMCs, the average prices paid for food items
decrease. While the effects are estimated with varying amount of precision, overall the
results are highly significantly different from zero. No obvious pattern of coefficient size
seems to exist: we find the largest effects for ham, lettuce, butter/margarine, tomatoes,
potatoes, and coffee, which are a mix of branded and unbranded products. Yet, we find
relatively small effects for ground beef, apples and bananas, which are typically
unbranded products, but we also find relatively small effects for cereal and yogurt, which
typically are branded products. Overall, we find a statistically negative effect on
average prices as shopping in superstores increases. Thus, we find the “direct effect”
operates as household shift their expenditure from traditional supermarkets to lower
priced superstore outlets.
In Graph 5.1 we depict the difference in average prices paid by households due to
the spread of SMC stores over the period. During the sample period from January 1998
to December 2001 the expenditure share of SMC stores increased from 10.9% to 16.9%,
a 55.3% increase over the 48 months or 11.6% per year. We take the econometric
18

estimates from Table 5.2 and use them to estimate the decrease in average price for each
food category. We then average across food categories and plot the results in Graph 5.1,
which demonstrates the increasing effect on average food prices as SMCs become more
available and households increase their expenditures at these retail outlets. We find that
food prices are 3.0% lower than otherwise, or an effect of about 0.75% year.

We estimate 18 of the 20 coefficients to be negative, with the only exceptions being
bread and cereal, neither of which is statistically significant.31 As would be expected
from economic theory, the effects of increased SMC expenditures are smaller for most of
the products. Thus, the “overall effect” on average prices paid by household arising
from substitution to lower priced SMCs typically exceeds the “indirect effect” of
decreased prices in supermarkets. Nevertheless, we do find some quite large indirect
effects as in lettuce, butter/margarine, coffee, ice cream, potatoes, tomatoes, and bottled
water. The spread of supercenters leads to lower prices both for households that shift
their food shopping from supermarket to SMC stores but also for households who
continue to shop at supermarkets because of lower prices caused by the increased
competition from expanding food offerings at SMCs.
In terms of one of the questions we posed at the beginning of the paper, the spread
of supercenters does significantly affect prices paid by households. Holding prices fixed
as households shift their expenditures to non-traditional retail outlets, we find the average
prices they pay decrease. However, prices also change because as households shift their
purchasing behavior, the increased competition forces supermarkets to lower their prices.
Both of these effects, the overall effect and indirect effect, lead to lower average prices
paid by households for food items.

VI.

Effects on Consumer Welfare

We now use the binomial choice model of Section III to estimate the changes in
consumer welfare that arise from the entry and expansion of supercenters. We use the
“virtual price approach” of Hausman (1997) and Hausman and Leonard (2002). The total
effect on consumers of the introduction of a new shopping outlet, i.e., the compensating
31

We find very similar results if we group the remaining Nielsen categories with supermarket: drug stores,
convenience, and “other”. These other outlet categories have relatively low expenditure levels compared to
traditional supermarkets.

21

variation, can be written as the difference in the consumers’ expenditure function before
and after the introduction, holding utility constant at the post-introduction level:

CV = e( p1 , p N ,r,u1 ) - e( p0 , p*N ( p0 ) ,r,u1 )

(6.1)

where p1 is the price index of post-introduction prices of the competing shopping
outlets, pN is the post-introduction price of the new supercenter, r is a vector of prices of
products outside the market (which are assumed to be unaffected by the introduction),
and u1 is the post-introduction utility level. The pre-introduction utility level could also
be used which would yield an equivalent variation measure. The function p*N ( p0 )
defines the “virtual” price index for the new outlet, i.e., the reservation price at which
demand for the new outlet would be zero given the prices of the other products.
This total benefit to consumers can be broken into two parts,

CV = ⎡⎣e( p 1, p N ,r,u1 ) - e( p 1, p*N ( p1 ) ,r,u 1 )⎤⎦ +
⎡⎣e( p 1, p*N ( p1 ) ,r,u 1 ) - e( p 0 , p*N ( p1 ) ,r,u 1 )⎤⎦

(6.2)

and written as CV = VE + IPE. The first term (“VE”—the “variety effect”) represents
the increase in consumer welfare due to the availability of the new outlet, holding the
prices of the existing brands constant at their post-introduction level.
The second term (“IPE”--the “indirect price effect”) represents the change in
consumer welfare due to the change in the prices of existing outlets after the introduction.
By changing the competitive structure of the industry, the new outlet introduction will
lead to a decrease in the prices at existing outlets. The more closely the new outlet
competes with the existing outlets, the greater the downward effect on prices. Thus, in
addition to providing additional variety, the introduction of a new outlet can change
consumer welfare through an effect on the prices of existing outlets.

22

A. Estimation of the Fixed Effects Logit Model
We now estimate the fixed effects binomial logit model of equation (3.5). Given
that we have multiple monthly observations across households, we can estimate a fixed
effects model. We find the fixed effects to be quite important in explaining household
shopping behavior. We also find that fixed effects are required or otherwise a random
effects (or regular) binomial choice model fails a Hausman (1978) specification test
because unobserved household components are correlated with shopping behavior. We
estimate the coefficient of the log of the price index ratio in equation (3.5) to be -0.040
with an asymptotic standard error of (0.014). We also include the market ratio of
supercenter expenditure as another variable (which may be jointly endogenous), but we
find our estimate of β to remain nearly the same with an estimate of -0.035 (0.014),
which is not statistically different from our first estimate. We find a coefficient of log
income to be estimated at 0.024 (0.010).32 Thus, we find both the price index and income
to significantly effect outlet shopping choice.
We now use these parameter estimates to estimate the gain in consumer welfare
from the entry and expansion of Wal-Mart and other non-traditional retail outlets.
Because food expenditure is a significant amount of total expenditure, about 12%, and we
find that income plays a role in destination choice we estimate the exact competing
variation of equations (6.1) and (6.2) using the approach and numerical methods
developed in Hausman (1981), Hausman and Newey (1995), and Small and Rosen
(1981). These methods integrate the compensated choice function of equation (3.5), thus
evaluating the expenditure function, from the current price to the “virtual” price at which
demand for shopping at supercenters would be zero.
We estimate the compensating variation for each household for each period and
each month and aggregate over each market. Average food expenditure across markets
and periods is approximately $151 per month. The average variety affect across market
and period is substantial at an estimated exact compensating variation 20.2% of food
expenditure. Thus consumers benefit from the availability of supercenters. The effect
varies significantly across markets and periods as supercenters enter and expand during
32

Note that this coefficient is estimated from changes in household income over the sample period. It may suffer
from an errors in variables problem because it is self-reported. For a further discussion of errors in variables in panel

23

our sample period: the minimum estimated compensating variation from the variety effect
is estimated to be 9.6% of household expenditure on food and the maximum
compensating variation is estimated to be 32.7% of household expenditure on food.
We now estimate the exact compensating variation from the indirect price effect.
Note that this estimate will be less than the amount that traditional outlets decrease their
prices when supercenters enter or expand in a market, because only savings on actual
expenditures are estimated. We estimate the average exact compensating variation from
the indirect price effect to be 4.8% of food expenditure across markets and time periods.
Again we find significant variation across markets and across time with the range of our
estimates 1.3% to 7.3%.
We now add the two sets of estimates together using equations (6.1) and (6.2) and
the fact that our approach uses integrable estimates of compensating variation since we
have used the compensated demand functions. We find the overall average increase in
the ratio of exact compensating variation to overall food expenditure to be 25.0%.
Considering the minimum and maximum estimates over markets and time periods we find
an estimated range of 14.9% to 36.6% of household expenditure. We give the results in
Table 6.1:

Thus, we find a substantial and significant effect of increased compensating variation for

traditional food outlets. Our estimates take account of price and service differentials
across stores as well as household attributes.
We consider the distributional effects of our compensating variation estimates.
The ACNielsen Homescan data groups the income response into categories and in Graph
6.1 we plot the compensating variation in terms of these categories:

CV

Note that the compensation variation differs by income category. For household
income below $10,000 we estimate compensation variation in the range of 29% of
household food expenditure. Thus, these less well-off households benefit greatly by
shopping at supercenters. Indeed, they benefit by approximately 50% more than the
average effect we estimate in Table 6.1. As income increases we estimate decreased
proportions of compensating variation as a percentage of food expenditure. Thus, we
conclude that less well-off households benefit the most by the spread of supercenters.33

33

While we do not explore the issue, since less well-off households have a higher marginal utility of income the
benefit to these households would be even greater than our estimates find if this factor were taken into account.

25

We further explore demographic effects by using weighted least squares to
estimate a model where the estimate of household compensating variation is regressed on
demographic factors. The results are given in Table 6.2:

As we found in Graph 6.1, lower household income has a significant effect on estimated
household compensating variation. Minorities also gain a significantly higher amount of
consumer surplus. Education level does not have a significant effect on compensating
variation. The spread of supercenters has the greatest impact on poorer households and
minority households. Thus, the spread of supercenters has favorable distribution effects
across the population.

B. Estimation of an Individual Household Logit Model
Our estimates above arise from a fixed effects logit model where the elasticities
differ across households in part because we allow for an individual household effect. We
find these individual household effects to be quite important in explaining household
shopping behavior. Consequently, they also have an important effect on the estimates of
compensating variation. In estimating the fixed effects model we account for the

26

“incidental parameters” problem that arises as the number of households becomes large
relative to the number of time periods.
Since we have 48 monthly observations for most households, we return to the
estimation of equation (3.5) and explore estimation with both a separate household fixed
effect and a separate slope coefficient for each household.34 Thus, we estimate an
individual set of parameters {α i , β 1i } for each household. Whether 48 observations are
sufficient to obtain reasonable results is an empirical question, given the non-linear form
of equation (3.5).35 We explored estimation of a “log-odds” model of the Berkson-Theil
form for each household where the log (pit/(1-pit)) is regressed on a household constant
and the difference in (log) prices from equation (3.5). The model specification becomes
linear after the transformation of the left-hand side variable. We found similar results so
that our inference is that 48 observations may be enough to estimate individual household
parameters in this situation.
We now explore how these estimates differ from the fixed effects logit model
with a common slope parameter across households but different household fixed effects.36
We now find an average surplus proportion of expenditure from the variety effect of
17.0% compared to our earlier estimate of 20.2% in Table 6.1. If we symmetrically trim
the estimates using a 5% trimming factor we estimate the average variety effect to be
17.3%; with a 10% trimming factor we estimate the average variety effect to be 17.7%.
Thus, we find somewhat smaller estimates of the compensating variation when we allow
for a model with different household parameters both for the fixed effect and for the slope
parameter. When we include the indirect price effect of Table 6.1 we find compensating
variation exceeding 21% of overall food expenditure, which remain a quite significant
amount.
Estimating separate slope coefficients leads to a significant amount of variation in
the estimated coefficients. Indeed, approximately 6% of the coefficients are estimated to

34

For some households we have fewer than 48 observations. Our results are not sensitive to inclusion of these
households.
35
Beggs, Cardell, and Hausman (1981) estimated individual parameter models in a logit context for ordered choice
data.

We base these results only on household with negative estimates of

parameters were significant and positive.

We found about 5.6% of the estimated

the individual household coefficient toward the overall coefficient estimate we estimated
in the previous section:

the fixed effect estimate of -0.0403 from the last section.37 Rather than attempting to
choose an “optimal” value of λ using a statistical criterion such as cross-validation, we
provide the estimates of the average β i and the average compensating variation for
various values of λ in Table 6.3:

Interestingly, we do not find the compensating variation estimates to be monotonic in λ .
They initially decrease and then begin to increase reaching a maximum of approximately
0.41. They then decrease monotonically until they become essentially equal to the
compensating variation estimate we found using the fixed effects model we estimated
above. The results do lead us to conclude that a significant increase in compensating
variation arises from the spread of supercenters.
37

For a discussion of penalized least squares, see e.g. G. Robinson (1991) and R. Beran (2001). Interestingly,
Robinson fails to recognize the need for fixed effects when right hand variables are not orthogonal to the individual
effects as Hausman (1978) and Hausman-Taylor (1981) discuss.

VII. Conclusion

Over the past 15 years the largest development in food retailing has been the
introduction of Wal-Mart supercenters that compete most closely with traditional
supermarkets. Wal-Mart has expanded greatly, mostly in the South and Southwest, and
become the largest supermarket chain in the U.S. Wal-Mart is now expanding into
additional geographic markets in California and the upper Midwest, so its effects will
become even more important.38 Wal-Mart offers many identical food items at an average
price about 15%-25% lower than traditional supermarkets. Wal-Mart’s entry into a new
geographic market creates a direct price effect by offering a lower price option to
consumers and an indirect price effect by causing traditional supermarkets to lower their
prices because of the increased competition. This paper estimates the effect on consumer
welfare of the entry and expansion of Wal-Mart and other supercenters into geographic
markets.
We find that an appropriate approach to the analysis is to let the choice to shop at
Wal-Mart be considered as a “new good” to consumers when Wal-Mart enters a
geographic market. Some consumers continue to shop at traditional supermarkets while
other consumers choose to shop at Wal-Mart. Many consumers shop at both types of
stores. Thus, we specify a utility consistent two level model of choice among types of
shopping destinations. We then estimate a fixed effects binomial logit choice model to
estimate the parameters of the utility model that differs across households. We use the
estimated parameters to calculate the exact compensating variation that arises from the
direct variety effect of the entry and expansion of supercenters and find the average
estimate to be 20.2% of average food expenditure. We similarly estimate the exact
compensating variation from the indirect price effect that arises from the increased
competition that supercenters create. We find this average effect to be 4.8%. Thus, we
estimate the average effect of the total the compensating variation to be 25% of food
expenditure, a sizeable estimate.
Since we find that lower income households tend to shop more at these low priced
outlets and their compensating variation is higher from supercenters than higher income
households, a significant decrease in consumer surplus arises from zoning regulations

Wal-Mart has announced plans to open 40 supercenters in California in the next 3-5 years, Wiltamuth op. cit.

particular geographic markets.
