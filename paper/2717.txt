Our results suggest that the decision-making model appropriate for
situations involving potential gains is different from the model
appropriate for situations with potential losses.

This is, of course, a

major contention of Kahneman and Tversky (1979) who suggest that the
outcome transform will be different in the two settings.

Contrary to

Kahneman and Tveraky's suggestion, we find that it is differences in the
way in which probabilities are transformed, not differences in the way
outcomes are transformed, that usually distinguishes the model for gains
from the model for losses.

The Models Considered
Consider a simple prospect

Under an expected utility model, the decision

maker is assumed to maximize expected utility which is defined as

Attitudes

toward risk are reflected in the

shape of the utility function.
Since the 1950s some researchers have been uncomfortable with this
model because they feel that decision makers do not use objective
that are
probabilities, but rather develop subjective probabilities, s(p),
used to weight outcomes. These subjective probabilities are asawned to
follow standard probability rules, but they need not be equal to objecttve
probabilities. For example,

Savage (1954) suggests that the individual

seeks to maximize subjective expected utility which is defined as

a(p)u(x1)

+

s(l-p)u(x2).

Like the expected utility model this subjective expected utility model
assumes

that attitudes toward risk are reflected in the utility function.

Edwards

toward
(1955) develops a similar model but suggests that attitudes

risk are embedded in the probability transform not in the utility or value
function.

More recently a n.unber of economists have developed axiomatic decision
models which embed risk attitudes in the probability transform and assume
no transformation of outcomes.

As far as we are aware, Handa (1977) developed the first

such axiomatic model.

Under his model the individual is assumed to

maximize

x1h(p)

We refer to such models as probability-

+ x2h(l-p).

4
The function h transforms objective into subjective probabilities and risk
attitudes are reflected in the shape of the probability transform. For
prospects with more than two outcomes, Fishburn (1978) has shown that
Hands's model implies maximization of expected returns if violations of
stochastic dominance are to be avoided.
Quite recently Ysari (1987) has developed a theory dual to the
expected utility model that transforms probabilities but not outcomes,
embeds risk attitudes

in the probability transform and avoids diffirulties

with previous models of this type (e.g., Hands, 1977; Quiggina,

Yaari

1982)L

sees the transform on probabilities as indicating how "perceived risk

is processed into choice"

(p.108).

Note that Yaari's transform of

probabilities is quite different than the transform proposed in subjertive
expected utility models or Hands's model.
Kshnemsn and Tversky (1979) propose an inductively developed theory.

The value function is
Kahneman and Tveraky suggest

that the value function is concave above and convex below the reference
point and that the function is steeper for losses than for gains.

The

decision weights are not required to obey the mathematical rules of
probability. They measure "the impact of events on the desirability of the
prospects and not merely the perceived likelihood of these events"

S

(Kahneman and Tversky, 1979, p.285).

Conceptually these decision weights

are more like Yaari's probability trsnsform than the probability transforms
of the other models we have considered.

The decision weights are assumed

to have the following properties:

1.

subadditivity,

2.

subcertainty,

3.

ir(rp)
Thr(p.)

> rm(p) for O<r<l,
C 1 and

subproportionality,
ir(pr)/r(p) C ir(pqr)/ir(pq) for O<p,q,r<l
which implies that the ratio of the weights of small
probabilities is closer to 1 than those of large probabilities.

In Kahnemsn and Tversky's model, attitudes

toward risk are embedded in both

the value transform and the decision weighting function.

III.

The Empirical Model

Consider the following model for a two outcome prospect:
V(Y) =

f(p)v(x1)

+

f(l-p)v(x2)

where V(Y) is a preference function over the risky prospect,

The Data
Our data were obtained from two groups of young adult North

Carolinians. The first group of 47 was selected at random from the
undergraduate student body at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill.

These students were part of a computer administered panel study and,

thus, were familiar with the type of interattive

computer program that we

use to sdminister the decision-making scenarios.

Students are the most

commonly used subjects for laboratory experiments.
To broaden the socioeconomic representstion of participants, we
selected a second group of 23 subjects at random from a set of
incarcerated,

young (18-22) male property offenders.

These offenders had

been randomly assigned to participate in an innovative job training/
reintegration program.
Each group was presented with two types of risky decisions. The first
was a set of standard money gambles (over gains and losses) of the kind
generally used in this type of laboratory experiment.

The second involved

a criminal choice (gain) scenario and a plea bargain (loss) scenario.
Responses to the latter type of decisions appeared to be subject to fewer

9

attention lapses and judgement errors, perhaps because the scenarios
appeared more concrete.

We present results only for the second type of

risky decisions although our general conclusion would be similar if we used
data for the standard money gambles.
Because the amount of time with students was limited, we developed an
interactive computer program that contained instructions and presented the
decision-making scenarios.

Students were paid for their participation in

the study.

We provided the offenders

in our study with verbal instructions and

a set of "practice" risky decisions on the computer because of their lqver
level of education and lack of experience with interactive
programs.

computer

Their responses to the practice decisions were observed.

Misunderstandings were cleared up and questions

answered.

The offenders

were then presented with scenarios by the same interactive computer progrsis
ss used with the students.
To obtain certsinty equivalents (CEs) for gains we presented subjects
with

scenarios

like the following:

Suppose that you had decided to break into one of two markets -or Harry's.
Further, suppose that you knew that it would take
the same skill to break into either market and that the risk of
capture waa the same. Further, suppose that you know that Jack has
$900 in his register half of the time and $100 the other half, while
Harry always has some cash in his register.

Jack's

The options available to the subject were then presented in tabular form
and the subject was asked "what is the smallest number of dollars there
would have to be in Harry's register before you would choose to break into
Harry's rather than Jack's?".

This is the certainty equivalent value we

use when estimating our model.5

Further,

Inmates provided certainty equivalents for 34 gain and 34 loss
scenarios.

Due to the limitation on student time noted above, students

provided responses to only 29 gain and 29 loss scenarios. Thus, student
models are estimated with 29 data points and inmate models with 34.

V.

Method of Estimation
We use an iteratively reweighted nonlinesr least squares technique to

estimate our model.

This procedure is robust to outliers because it gives

11

less weight to such observations than would a standard least squares
procedure. The method of reweighting observations is due to Beaton and
Tukey (1974)

.

VII. Conclusions

We believe that our work makes both a methodological and substantive
contribution.

From a methodological perspective,

implemented a procedure that allows researchers

to more systematically use

laboratory evidence to evaluate alternative models of risky decision
making.

To date, both economists and psychologists have generally

laboratory data are generally obtained from readily available subjects such
as college undergraduate volunteers or students in particular classes.

The

patterns observed in these data are then used either to infer a model
(e.g.

1979) or to corroborate a deductively

developed model (e.g., Handa, 1977; Yaari, 1987).

models of risky decision making and assess the relative merits of the
alternative models using scandard statistical tests.

More specifically,

our dats are for a group that is representative of the undergraduate
population of a large state university and a group representative of the
young, male property offenders. While these samples are certainly not
ideal, they are representative of identifiable populations and come from a

broader range of socioeconomic backgrounds than has usually been the case.
The mathematical form we use will, under various parametric restrictions,
yield a prospect theory, a subjective expected utility, a probability
transform and an expected utility model.

We estimate the parameters of

this model using a robust, nonlinear least squares procedure and use

standard statistical tests to distinguish among the alternative models.

Under this type of model, risk attitudes are reflected in the

function that transforms probabilities and outcomes are not transformed.
Such models have been developed quite recently (e.g., Handa, 1977; Yaeri,
1987) and have not, as far as we are aware, been used in applied settings.

However, Yasri ties such models to more widely used models by showing that
there is a probability transform model dual to the expected utility model.

It is interesting that of the four models we consider, we find least

Our results

suggest that the major difference in decision making for gain and loss

For surveys of the litersture,

see Schoemaker (1982), Sugden (1986) or

Machins (1987).
2.

In both Quiggins'

(1982) snd Yasri's model the transform is not over

the simple probability of an outcome but rather over all (Quiggins)

or part

of the distribution (Yaari, 1987).
3.

Work by Kahnenman and Tversky (1979) and Fishburn and Kochenberger

(1979) suggests that the reference point is near the current asset level
and, thus,

separate assessments over gains and losses should capture this

aspect of Kshneninan and Tversky's model for the young adult subjects we
use.

We treat losses as positive numbers as we must if we are to use this

outcome

transform.

This,

of course, means that under an expected utility

or subjective expected utility model, risk aversion is implied by convexity
and risk-seeking behavior by concavity when the model is estimated for
losses.

The careful reader will note thst this is only a very close

approximation to s true certainty equivslent.

However, this method of

presentation greatly simplified the subjects'

task and increased their

understanding of the decision making problem. Given rounding this
"threshold equivalent" should be virtually identical to the certainty
equivalent.

For gain scenarios seven subjects provided unreasonable responses and

parameter estimates

for six subjects failed to converge.

For loss

scenarios, eleven subjects provided unreasonable responses and parameter
estimates for two subjects failed to converge.
