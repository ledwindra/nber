    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper presents empirical evidence against the standard dichotomy in macroeconomics that separates growth from the volatility of economic fluctuations.  In a sample of 92 countries as well as a sample of OECD countries, we find that countries with higher volatility have lower growth.  The addition of standard control variables strengthens the negative relationship.  We also find that government spending-induced volatility is negatively associated with growth even after controlling for both time- and country-fixed effects.\n\n",
