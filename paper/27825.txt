ABSTRACT
Institutional leaders have long championed interdisciplinary research; however, researchers have
paid relatively little attention to the people responding to such calls and their subsequent career
outcomes. With the benefit of two large datasets spanning from 1986 through 2016, we show that
interdisciplinary dissertations have become consistently more common in recent years as
institutional leaders have highlighted the value of boundary-spanning research for solving
important and emergent problems. With the benefit of survey data from a near-complete
population of all dissertators in the US starting in 2001 through 2016, we observe a consistent
upward trend in interdisciplinary dissertations. Unfortunately, we show that these
interdisciplinary dissertators have experienced a comparably persistent penalty when considering
salaries for their first year after earning the PhD. We also show that among interdisciplinary
dissertators, individuals in lower-paying fields tend to earn more when choosing distantly related
topic-combinations whereas researchers in higher-paying fields tend to be most rewarded for
staying within relatively narrow disciplinary silos.

Dissertators with Distantly Related Foci
Face Divergent Near-Term Outcomes
1. Introduction
Institutional leaders in academia, government, and industry often celebrate
interdisciplinary research that spans traditional disciplinary boundaries – and benefits from
unconventional recombinations of perspectives – as critical for solving new, emergent, and very
important problems (e.g., National Research Council, 2014; Roco & Bainbridge, 2013; Sharp,
Jacks, & Hockfield, 2016). The call for people to conduct interdisciplinary research, though, runs
against the grain of academic disciplines that provide “recipes” for addressing various sets of
focal problems (Hackett & Rhoten, 2009). The tension between these tendencies to champion
interdisciplinary work while acknowledging the power of specialized academic disciplines is
visible in numerous bibliometric studies that have tended (with exceptions) to show relatively
less impact generated by interdisciplinary research (Leahey, Beckman, Stanko, 2017; Millar,
2013; Rafols et al., 2012; Seibert et al., 2017). Among the groups of people who need to navigate
these countervailing pressures that differentially affect people across career stages (Rhoten &
Parker, 2004), the population of graduate students warrants particular attention since all
dissertators work within academia and, consequently, actively engage in institutions that
paradoxically champion interdisciplinary research while concurrently rewarding
monodisciplinary activities. Graduate students are also important to study since doctoral training
is a formative career stage with long-term consequences that extend beyond the dissertation.
In contrast with the bibliometric studies that measure the performance of interdisciplinary
research through publications, citations, and/or patents, this paper focuses on understanding the
career-level paths that graduate students encounter when they do or do not conduct
interdisciplinary dissertation research. More specifically, we focus on the population of graduate
students in the United States and examine (i) whether there has been a trend over time with
respect to the percentage of dissertations that are interdisciplinary; (ii) the extent to which there
are demographic factors that appear to influence whether a person conducts interdisciplinary
research as a graduate student; and, (iii) the degree to which interdisciplinary dissertators are
either rewarded or penalized in terms of their initial career outcomes.
Our analyses show that there has been a substantial increase in the percentage and
number of interdisciplinary dissertations; there are not overwhelming demographic differences
when comparing interdisciplinarians and monodisciplinarians; and, despite the increase in

Dissertators with Distantly Related Foci

interdisciplinarity, there appears to be a persistent penalty incurred by interdisciplinary
dissertators over time, even when controlling for demographic and disciplinary variables.
Further, when we consider the distance between topics that interdisciplinarians integrate in their
work, there is a tendency for individiduals in lower-paying fields (Life Sciences, Math, and
Humanities) who combine distantly related topics to enjoy near-term advantages; however,
individuals in higher-paying fields (Engineering and Business) tend to enjoy higher starting
salaries if they avoid interdisciplinary pursuits, especially with more distant fields.
The Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) sponsored by the National Science Foundation
(NSF) has long been a part of the graduation process for everyone earning a PhD in the United
States. The survey started tracking interdisciplinary dissertations in 2001
<https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvydoctorates/> and began measuring salaries for the year after
earning a PhD in 2008. With the restricted-access microdata that is generated through the SED,
our analyses utilize the dissertation field data and demographic information provided by doctoral
graduates as well as several measures of near-term employment outcomes (e.g., salaries). Our
analyses draw on responses from slightly more than 688,000 people who earned doctoral degrees
in the US between 2001 and 2016. As a complement to the SED microdata, we also utilized
dissertation data available from ProQuest in order to assess trends in interdisciplinarity over a
longer period of time (1986-2015) with the benefit of data from 1,009,954 dissertations. Our
work was approved by Ohio State University and Cornell University institutional review boards.

2. Data and Empirics
To measure interdisciplinarity trends over time, we rely on two sets of data that provide
dissertation fields for PhD recipients: a) the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) and b) ProQuest
Dissertations and Theses. The National Science Foundation’s (NSF) National Center for Science
and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) oversees the SED and relies on individual responses for
most of the data and then uses information from commencement programs and university
websites for the remaining individuals. SED respondents specify their dissertation field by
selecting from a list of over 300 fields. Each individual field also exists within a broader, more
general, area. In 2001, NCSES included a question asking whether PhD recipients had a
secondary field for their dissertation. Upon answering yes, respondents could then enter the code
for the secondary field. Since then, NCSES has slightly modified this question to allow

Dissertators with Distantly Related Foci

5

respondents to enter more fields and to ask if the research is interdisciplinary. These
modifications do not influence overall trends in interdisciplinarity.
The ProQuest Dissertation & Theses data is the world’s largest curated collection of
dissertations and theses and the official offsite dissertation repository for the U.S. Library of
Congress. It contains dissertations published from 1861 and documents the comprehensive
information of each dissertation, including a unique publication identifier, research subject,
institution information (a school identifier and name), and the degree information of the recipient
(the degree and date). In this study about interdisciplinary dissertations, we focus on Ph.D.
recipients who graduated from US institutions after 1985, when multiple fields on one
dissertation started to be recorded in the Subject variable of by ProQuest. Therefore, we analyze
1,009,954 dissertations from Ph.D. recipients between 1986 and 2015 and parse the fields listed
for each dissertation (i.e., our sample stops with 2015 due to incomplete information for 2016).
Similar to the SED, each individual field in ProQuest can be classified into a broader and more
general area. To be consistent with the SED, we categorize them into 11 major areas: life
sciences, engineering, computer and information science, mathematics and statistics, physical
sciences, psychology, social sciences, humanities, education, business, and communication.

2.1 Measures of Interdisciplinarity
In this work, we use three measures of interdisciplinarity. For the first “General”
measure, we classify someone as interdisciplinary if they indicate a second dissertation field
(SED) or indicate a second field (ProQuest). We separate this measure into Global and Local
interdisciplinarian subsets. We characterize Global interdisciplinarians as those who select a
secondary field outside of their primary top-level field. Conversely, we label respondents as
Local interdisciplinarians if their secondary field falls within the same primary top-level field.
For example, we would classify an individual with a primary field of Civil Engineering and a
secondary field of Mechanical Engineering as a Local interdisciplinarian since both fields fall
under the top-level field of Engineering. Moreover, we would classify an individual with a
primary field of Organic Chemistry and a Secondary Field of Biotechnology as Globally
interdisciplinary since Organic Chemistry falls under the top-level field of Physical Sciences
while Biotechnology falls under the top-level field of Life Sciences. Interested readers can view

<https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvydoctorates/>.
2.2. Measures of Outcomes
Our interest is to understand the prevalence of interdisciplinarity over time as well as the
near-term success of interdisciplinary PhDs recipients in the job market. Consequently, our
outcome measurements include the three different interdisciplinarity variables we construct from
the SED data. In addition to these outcomes, we also use a variable that indicates whether the
individual accepted a postdoctoral research position, or a position in academia, industry, or
government. Lastly, since 2008, the SED has collected data on self-reported salary and we use
this information to study whether interdisciplinary dissertators receive a salary premium or face a
salary penalty.
2.3. Covariates
In our empirical models, we control for a variety of individual and institutional
characteristics to reduce the possibility that patterns we observe in interdisciplinarity over time
and associations between interdisciplinarity and our other outcomes are driven by individual
and/or institutional characteristics. For individual characteristics, we include the respondent’s
age, sex, marital status (married or not), US citizenship status, race, and level of parental
education. We also include characteristics of the respondent’s educational experience including
whether the degree granting institution is public or private, the degree granting institution’s
Carnegie Classification for research activity (R1, R2, R3, or R4), and whether the respondent
worked as a research assistant during graduate school. To capture year-by-year variation, we also
include yearly indicator variables.

3. Empirical Models
We estimate several regressions to track the prevalence of interdisciplinary dissertators
over time, the degree to which covariates correlate with interdisciplinary research, and how
interdisciplinary dissertators fare in the job market. In each regression, we include our set of
covariates. To account for the non-independence of observations within universities, we also
cluster our standard errors by field. While we do not use hierarchical linear models, clustering
standard errors addresses the fact that our observations, PhD recipients, are nested within
universities. In the regressions where we use job placement (postdoc, academia, industry, or

Dissertators with Distantly Related Foci

7

government) as outcomes, we also include an interdisciplinarity measure. As a result, for each of
these outcomes, we have three different regressions corresponding to the three measures of
interdisciplinarity.

4. Results
Figure 1A shows a robust uptrend from 2001-2016 in the percentage of interdisciplinary
dissertations. While there are some year-to-year fluctuations, the uptrend is visible for all 3
measures of interdisciplinarity that we computed: “Interdisciplinary: General”,
“Interdisciplinary: Local”, and “Interdisciplinary: Global”. Following the convention established
in prior work (Barringer, Leahey, & Salazar, 2020; Kniffin & Hanks, 2017; Millar, 2013),
“Interdisciplinary General” classifies all dissertations with a secondary field as interdisciplinary
and is the sum of the “local” and “global” measures. Our identification of local and global
interdisciplinarity relies upon the two levels of field-categories – aggregated (or top-level) and
fine (or bottom-level) – established through the field list available in the SED. As a result, we
classify dissertations with primary and secondary fields (e.g., Evolutionary Biology and
Horticulture Science) in the same top-level category (e.g., Life Sciences) as “locally”
interdisciplinary while dissertations with fields in different top-level categories (e.g., Robotics in
Engineering and Economics in Social Sciences) as “globally” interdisciplinary. Complementary
to the uptrend in interdisciplinarity, Figure 1A also shows the downtrend (but still predominance)
of monodisciplinary dissertations (overall rate of 73.1% across 2001-2005 to 59.5% across 201116).
-----------------------Insert Figure 1 here
-----------------------To identify which disciplines tend to foster interdisciplinary dissertations and how those
propensities have evolved, Figure 1B shows how the uptrend in interdisciplinarity has occurred
across each of the aggregate or top-level field categories. As a share of total PhD recipients
within each top-level category, the Physical Sciences, Humanities, and Communications
generate the highest percentages of interdisciplinary dissertators. Figure 1C indicates – for the
full sample of dissertations that list more than one dissertation field – the frequency of
secondary-field pairings (on the right side) associated with each primary field (on the left side).

The thickness of the bands that stay within a given top-level category reflect “locally”
interdisciplinary dissertations whereas the bands that start in one top-level category and mix with
another top-level category reflect the relative frequency and nature of “globally”
interdisciplinary dissertations. Within the top-level field categories, the proportion of
dissertations that are generally interdisciplinary ranges from 23% (Math) to 39% (Life Sciences)
and 43% (Communication). Appendix Figure 1 illustrates a similar patterns in terms of trends
over time, differences across fields, and patterns of field pairings using ProQuest data spanning
1986 through 2015.
Figure 2A shows, based on sample means, that general interdisciplinarians – and within
that group, Local interdisciplinarians – appear, consistently across the span of 2008-2016, to be
paid less than others in the year after earning a PhD. It is equally remarkable and intriguing in
Figure 2A that Global interdisciplinarians appear to have earnings that are approximately
equivalent to monodisciplinarians.
-----------------------Insert Figure 2 here
-----------------------One important consideration regarding salaries is recognition that salaries tend to be
substantially higher for those working in industry compared with other sectors (e.g., Hanks &
Kniffin, 2014). As is visible in Figure 2B, there is variation in employment sector across (inter)disciplinary categories. 17.4% of monodisciplinarians tend to go to industry compared with
14.8% of the interdisciplinarians; however, it is equally notable that 16.1% of the global
interdisciplinarians went to work in industry compared with 13.9% of the local
interdisciplinarians. Similarly, it is helpful to recognize that – while local interdisciplinarians
more commonly become postdocs than monodisciplinarians – the global interdisciplinarians are
more like the monodisciplinarians in that regard. Specifically, 51.9% of the local
interdisciplinarians choose to take postdoc positions compared with 41.8% of the global
interdisciplinarians and 41.4% of the monodisciplinarians. We report full descriptive statistics in
Table 1.
-----------------------Insert Table 1 here
------------------------

Dissertators with Distantly Related Foci

Figure 2C, which includes the full SED sample from 2001-2016, shows that there exists
minimal variation across the demographic categories in the percentages of interdisciplinary
dissertators. Notably, the percentages of and interdisciplinary dissertators are basically
equivalent for men and women and whether someone was a first-generation college graduate or
completed their doctoral studies at a research-intensive (R1) university. We include the
descriptive statistics for these variables in Table 2.
-----------------------Insert Table 2 here
-----------------------While individual demographic characteristics do not differ dramatically with respect to
(inter-)disciplinarity, there are a few meaningful differences. For instance, with respect to
citizenship, fewer US citizens complete interdisciplinary dissertations compared with noncitizens (63% of interdisciplinarians are US citizens while 66% of monodisciplinarians are US
citizens), but there are no meaningful differences in terms of global versus local
interdisciplinarity by citizenship. With respect to race, we find that White doctoral graduates are
more likely to have completed monodisciplinary dissertations (i.e., 64% of interdisciplinarians
are White while almost 68% of monodisciplinarians are White). While there is a substantial
positive correlation between White and US citizen (r = .55, p < .01), the models that we report
below take into account demographic characteristics when assessing the existence and size of
differences between interdisciplinarians and monodisciplinarians. Such consideration of
demographic variables for understanding innovative research is visible in recent findings
(Hofstra et al., 2020) showing that individuals from historically under-represented groups
disproportionately produce such work. Our analyses, though, importantly consider citizenship as
a covariate given well-established findings (Hunt & Gauthier-Loiselle, 2010; Stephan & Levin,
2001) that immigrants (compared with non-immigrants) are more likely to be innovative.

4.1 Upward Trend in Interdisciplinary Dissertations
It is clear from our analyses of the SED as well as ProQuest dissertation data that there
are uptrends in interdisciplinarity in recent decades. On the one hand, the uptrend in
interdisciplinary dissertations should not be surprising given the frequency of institutional

Dissertators with Distantly Related Foci

10

leaders calling for more boundary spanning work as well as prior research charting attitudes
towards interdisciplinary research (Klein, 1990). On the other hand, beyond the disciplines
providing “recipes” for individuals to succeed (Hackett & Rhoten, 2009), it is also true that –
among academics at least – there tend to be suspicions cast on those who breach a given
discipline’s bounds (Abbott, 2010; Campbell, 1969). For example, at the same time that
institutional leaders might include interdisciplinary programs as part of their strategic plans
(Barringer et al., 2020), there also exist researchers who take care – often for good reasons – to
guard against “epistemic trespassing” (Ballantyne, 2019).
We can use our classification of dissertations as locally or globally interdisciplinary to
understand the degree to which PhD students diversify their training. Specifically, local
interdisciplinarians choose secondary fields closely related to their primary field. Consequently
they diversify their skill set less relative to global interdisciplinarians who select more distantly
related fields. Notably, we observe that between these two groups of interdisciplinarians, global
interdisciplinarians have become more frequent – and with relatively greater speed (from 7.8%
of all PhD recipients in 2001 to 19.6% in 2016) – compared to the percentage of PhD recipients
completing a locally interdisicplinary dissertation (16.2% in 2001, escalating to 25.1% in 2016).
Job placement outcomes also highlight differences between local and global
interdisciplinarians. Most notably, global interdisciplinarians track placements of
monodisciplinarians very closely. In both categories, 25% accept positions in Education and both
are very close in Postdoctoral and Industry placements. Figure 2B makes it clear, though, that a
higher percentage of local interdisciplinarians select Postdoc positions and that they account for
the greater share of general interdisciplinarians compared to monodisciplinarians taking Postdoc
positions. If interdisciplinarians entered postdoc positions because successful interdisciplinary
work required more training, in contrast to what we find, one might have expected more global
interdisicplinarians to take postdocs. As with our consideration of demographic characteristics,
these placement findings are interesting on their surface since they speak to the risks and rewards
of interdisciplinary work, and they are key for the analysis below.

4.2 Stable Penalty Incurred by Interdisciplinary Dissertators
If the labor market for people earning a PhD truly valued interdisciplinary research, then
we would expect to see interdisciplinarians earn higher wages across most, at least, top-level

Dissertators with Distantly Related Foci

11

fields. The patterns we observe in Figure 1A and Figure 2A suggest just the opposite:
interdisciplinarians have experienced a persistent and stable near-term penalty. Among the
possible reasons for this stable penalty, which persists even with the overall drop in salaries that
occurred in the wake of the 2008-9 financial crisis in the United States, a lack of information
among market participants may be important. Standard labor economics would predict that in the
absence of other factors, such as a preference for doing interdisciplinary work, people in a given
market should gain awareness of various penalties associated with a given activity and, in turn,
people should start avoiding whatever activity incurs a penalty.
In this case, the stability of the penalty suggests at least two possible explanations: 1) that
a substantial percentage of dissertators in the United States are taking on interdisciplinary
dissertations with either “naive optimism” (Golde & Dore, 2001) whereby they do not have an
understanding of the likely penalty, or 2) perhaps willful optimism whereby they are sufficiently
motivated by personal preference to study the topic of their choice and the relative penalty does
not deter them. With respect to willful optimism and preferences, one would expect that
dissertators from more privileged backgrounds may be more able and willing to accept a salary
penalty but we see in Figure 2C (and Table 3) that proxies for students’ family background
(parental education levels) do not show a strong difference when comparing interdisciplinarians
and monodisciplinarians.
-----------------------Insert Table 3 here
-----------------------Considering Figure 2A more closely, it is interesting to recognize that while “local”
interdisciplinarians (e.g., people indicating expertise in two subfields within the Life Sciences,
for example) are closer to being monodisciplinary in terms of field proximity, they are also the
main reason why there is an apparent penalty for conducting interdisciplinary research. In other
words, there is an apparent tension because the people who bridge distantly related fields and
might be perceived to be overly ambitious tend to have better near-term outcomes, at least, than
those who mix closely related fields. It is interesting in this context that the global
interdisciplinarians also tend to take slightly longer to complete their degree programs (see Table
1) – a pattern that makes sense given the lower amounts of redundant or overlapping content that
would be found in globally interdisciplinary dissertations. Separate from other potential

Dissertators with Distantly Related Foci

12

explanations for the persistent penalty incurred by (local) interdisciplinarians, another intriguing
possibility relates to the dynamic nature of how fields are related to each other and how fields
form. As Brint et al. (2009) note, there are reasons to expect that interdisciplinary combinations
that become common and successful enough will tend to become institutionalized and emerge as
distinct fields of their own over time. Indeed, the SED field listing does periodically update its
categorization of dissertations so it is reflective of the subjects that dissertators examine.
Consequently, if it were the case that there was significant and relatively rapid shifting of fields,
then the pattern that we see of a persistent penalty for interdisciplinary dissertations could be
reflected in a steady stream of new interdisciplinary combinations. As is visible in SI Appendix
Figure 2, we do not see evidence of such rapid shifting; consequently, the persistent penalty
faced by interdisciplinarians does not appear to be an artifact of newly emergent fields.
As previewed in prior sections, closer consideration of the role of placement offers
additional insight into the salary penalty that is visible in Figure 2A. As is visible in SI Appendix
Figure 3, we used linear regression methods to study how much of the interdisciplinary salary
penalty observed in Figure 2A is influenced by demographic and institutional characteristics.
Our analyses show that after we control for demographics and institutional characteristics, we
observe a very similar pattern as Figure 2A; however, when we control for top-level field
categories as well as placement (i.e., sector or type of employment after earning the PhD), there
is a tightening or minimizing of the differences that we see in Figure 2A. A benefit of the
contrasting models that we visualize in SI Appendix Figure 3 is that the differences indicate that
further nuance is needed to make sense of the patterns visible in Figures 1 and 2.

4.3 Distantly Related Combinations are More Valued than Closely Related Combinations
in Higher-Paying Fields
Figure 3 integrates our analyses and illustrates model-estimated means for each top-level
field for the near-term salaries earned by general, global, and local interdisciplinarians alongside
monodisciplinarians. In these analyses we control for individual and institutional demographics
and job placement. With the benefit of this fine-grained approach, we can see that in lowerpaying fields (Life Sciences, Math, and Humanities), global interdisciplinarians tend to have
earnings that are higher than monodisciplinarians while Monodisciplinarians tend to have

Dissertators with Distantly Related Foci

13

earnings that are higher than others in higher-paying fields (Engineering and Business). These
patterns are interesting for several reasons.
-----------------------Insert Figure 3 here
-----------------------First, it seems sensible in hindsight, at least, that people whose fields tend to command
relatively lower earnings may derive financial benefits by commingling their work with aspects
of more highly compensated fields. In other words, while decisions relating to graduate
education are a multifaceted product of preferences as well as earnings (e.g., earnings are low in
the Humanities given the length of training), people in lower paying fields can increase earnings
by becoming global interdisciplinarians. Indeed, this pattern complements prior research among
undergraduates examining which double-major combinations are more likely to associated with
higher returns after graduation (Del Rossi, Alison, & Hersch, 2016).
Second, to consider our findings in relation to more conventional or popular treatments of
people who are “too spread out,” our findings suggest that there are parts of the post-PhD labor
market that tend to reward wide-ranging generalists while other parts tend to guard against
would-be interlopers. It is an interesting sociological puzzle – outside of our scope – to consider
why and how such differences across disciplines exist and operate; however, our findings
suggest that there may be variations across disciplines with respect to the relative degree of
ethnocentrism and/or transdisciplinary orientation (Misra, Stokols, & Cheng, 2015). More
specifically, prior research examining how different fields treat interdisciplinary products (e.g.,
based on citation count) does not consider the substantial variation that exists among categories
of fields. Our work brigdes this gap and shows that there appear to be incentives for wideranging work, especially in lower-paying fields along with incentives for narrow work in higherpaying fields. In other words, Figure 3 makes it clear that financial incentives for “optimal
distinctiveness” (Leonardelli, Pickett, & Brewer, 2010) are not uniform across top fieldgroupings and that different fields clearly reward wide-ranging research differently.
Third, we know from preliminary analysis that the inverse relationship between near-term
salaries and global interdisciplinarity at the level of aggregate fields also appears to have some
analogues among finer-grained fields. For example, within the top-level category of Psychology,
the specific field of Industrial and Organization Psychology is the highest paying field and has

Dissertators with Distantly Related Foci

14

the lowest percentage of dissertators who combine their work with topics outside of Psychology.
We observe similar patterns for the specific field of Information Science and Systems within the
top-level category of Computer Science and the specific field of Veterinary Sciences within the
aggregated Life Sciences.

5. Limitations and Future Directions
Our focus on the individual-level career experiences is responsive to calls from
researchers studying institutional and bibliometric patterns related to interdisciplinarity (e.g.,
Carr, Loucks, & Blöschl, 2018; Solomon et al., 2019) to understand more closely “who” is
conducting the work and how do their careers tend to unfold. Limitations of the current research
relate to potential endogeneity associated with individual decisions to conduct interdisciplinary
dissertation research. We emphasize, though, that our objective is to establish annual trends and
provide an overall picture of demographic characteristics of interdisciplinarians compared to
mono-disciplinarians, the institutions where interdisciplinarians tend to receive PhDs, and nearterm outcomes as available in the SED data. We recognize that this approach overlooks
important statistical considerations, such as endogeneity, and we expect future researchers will
find appropriate ways to handle the endogeneity concerns and provide greater clarity to these
important questions. We do, though, emphasize that in the absence of available instrumental
variables that would allow for causal analysis, we control for a wide range of potential
confounding factors that could be plausibly related to wage effects associated with
interdisciplinary research.
Future research should also more closely examine the origins and mechanisms of the
divergent incentive-related patterns that we see among categories of fields. For example, the
concept of “social closure” (Weeden, 2002) seems to align with the findings whereby higherpaying fields effectively penalize members of the field for commingling their work with distantly
related fields. Recent work by Haeussler and Sauermann (2020) showing a positive association
between interdisciplinarity and division of labor within scientific teams also warrants closer
attention as a mechanism given that there also exists evidence that STEM doctoral graduates who
participate in teamwork (i.e., dividing up labor) tend to earn significantly higher wages (Kniffin
& Hanks, 2018). In other words, the relatively low rates of teamwork in certain fields (e.g.,

Dissertators with Distantly Related Foci

Humanities) (Wuchty, Jones, & Uzzi, 2007) is a potential factor that future research should
consider.
For empirical extensions of our findings, researchers should examine a broader array of
individual-level outcomes (e.g., health [Levecque et al., 2017]) alongside salary and placement.
In addition, a longer series of data that permit consideration of longitudinal patterns that might
accrue to people who conduct monodisciplinary or various kinds of interdisciplinary dissertation
research would be valuable. In that respect, a better understanding of who conducts
interdisciplinary research in mid- or late-career stages (D’Este et al., 2019) would also be
informative since it is very plausible that people who conducted monodisciplinary dissertations
as graduate students become interdisciplinarians later in their careers.

6. Conclusion
Interdisciplinary research is often celebrated at high administrative levels; however,
research on the products of interdisciplinary work (e.g., publications) have shown mixed
outcomes while studies of the individuals who take on the challenge of interdisciplinarity have
shown inferior outcomes. Our analyses focus on understanding the dissertators and new doctoral
graduates in the United States during a substantial span of recent years and we see that there is an
apparent, persistent salary penalty paid across fields for writing interdisciplinary dissertations;
however, there are more specific patterns whereby dissertators who bridge relatively large
distances are rewarded in lower-paying fields and penalized in higher-paying fields.

Figure 1: Trends in (inter-)disciplinarity of dissertations overall, by field and field-combinations. A shows the relative and consistent
decline in monodisciplinary dissertations and accompanying increase in local, global, and general interdisciplinary work. B shows the
proportion of interdisciplinarians within each each top-level field and how the uptrend in interdisciplinary work is common across toplevel dissertation (aggregated) fields. C illustrates – for interdisciplinary dissertators – which secondary top-level fields (right side)
accompany the primary top-level fields (left side). Interdisciplinary dissertators more commonly combine “local” subfields, direct
connection from left to right, that are part of the same top-level category. The chart also shows the relative frequency of “global”
combinations, connection from one top-level field to another, across top-level categories. The numbers in parentheses give the share
of dissertations in each field that are interdisciplinary generally. Data represent dissertations completed in the United States between
2001 and 2016 based on the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED).

Figure 2: Sample means and proportions for outcomes and characteristics of PhD recipients. A
shows how “local” interdisciplinarians have consistently earned salaries markedly lower than
others across the sample period while “global” interdisciplinarians and monodisciplinarians earn
salaries above the baseline of the overall population. B shows how placement varies depending
on the (inter)disciplinary status of a person’s dissertation with notable differences in,
respectively, lower- and higher-paying postdoc and industry positions. C shows relatively little
variation with respect to the background characteristics of doctoral graduates in relation to their
dissertations (inter)disciplinary status. Data are for earned doctorates in the United States and
span 2001-20016 for placements and 2008-2016 for salary. All data are from the Survey of
Earned Doctorates (SED).

the United States between 2008 through 2016.
