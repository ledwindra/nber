    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper analyzes the impact of \ufb01scal spending shocks in a dynamic, multi-country model with international production networks. We \ufb01rst derive a decomposition of the e\ufb00ects of a \ufb01scal spending shock on the GDP of any country. This decomposition de\ufb01nes the response as the sum of a Direct, Income, and Price e\ufb00ect. The Direct E\ufb00ect depends only on structural parameters and is independent of assumptions about monetary policy, wage setting, or capital mobility, while the Price E\ufb00ect is zero in the aggregate across countries. We apply this decomposition to an analysis of \ufb01scal spillovers in the Eurozone, using the production network structure from the World Input Output Database (WIOD). We \ufb01nd that \ufb01scal spillovers from Germany and some other large Eurozone countries may be large, and within the range of empirical estimates. Without international production network linkages, spillovers would be only a third as large as predicted by the baseline model. Finally, we explore the di\ufb00usion of identi\ufb01ed government spending shocks at the sectoral level, both within and across countries, using an empirical measure of the response, based on the theoretical decomposition. The empirical estimates are strongly consistent with the theoretical model.\n\n",
