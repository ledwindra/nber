Forecasting Stock Market Returns: The Sum of the Parts is More than the Whole
Miguel A. Ferreira and Pedro Santa-Clara
NBER Working Paper No. 14571
December 2008
JEL No. G1,G17
ABSTRACT
We propose forecasting separately the three components of stock market returns: dividend yield, earnings
growth, and price-earnings ratio growth. We obtain out-of-sample R-square coefficients (relative to
the historical mean) of nearly 1.6% with monthly data and 16.7% with yearly data using the most common
predictors suggested in the literature. This compares with typically negative R-squares obtained in
a similar experiment by Goyal and Welch (2008). An investor who timed the market with our approach
would have had a certainty equivalent gain of as much as 2.3% per year and a Sharpe ratio 77% higher
relative to the historical mean. We conclude that there is substantial predictability in equity returns
and that it would have been possible to time the market in real time.

Prediction is very diﬃcult, especially about the future. – Niels Bohr

1. Introduction
There is a long literature on forecasting stock market returns. Predictive variables that have
been proposed include price multiples, macro variables, corporate actions, and measures of
risk. Dow (1920), Campbell (1987), Fama and French (1988), Hodrick (1992), Ang and
Bekaert (2007), Cochrane (2008), and many others use the dividend yield; Campbell and
Shiller (1988) and Lamont (1998) use the earnings-price ratio; and Kothari and Shanken
(1997) and Pontiﬀ and Schall (1998) use the book-to-market ratio. Fama and Schwert
(1977), Campbell (1987), Breen, Glosten, and Jagannathan (1989), Ang and Bekaert (2007)
use the short-term interest rate; Nelson (1976), Fama and Schwert (1977), Campbell and
Vuolteenaho (2004) use inflation; Campbell (1987) and Fama and French (1988) use the
term and default yield spreads; and Lettau and Ludvigson (2001) use the consumptionwealth ratio. Baker and Wurgler (2000) and Boudoukh, Michaely, Richardson, and Roberts
(2007)) use corporate issuing activity. French, Schwert, and Stambaugh (1987), Ghysels,
Santa-Clara, and Valkanov (2005), and Guo (2006) use stock market volatility and Goyal
and Santa-Clara (2003) use idiosyncratic volatility. All these studies find evidence in favor
of return predictability in sample.1
These findings, however, have been questioned by several authors on the grounds that
the persistence of the forecasting variables and the correlation of their innovations with
returns might bias the regression coeﬃcients and aﬀect t-statistics (Nelson and Kim (1993),
Cavanagh, Elliott, and Stock (1995), Stambaugh (1999), Lewellen (2004), Torous, Valkanov,
and Yan (2004)). A further problem is the possibility of data mining (Foster, Smith, and
Whaley (1997), Ferson, Sarkissian, and Simin (2003)) illustrated by a long list of spurious
predictive variables that regularly show up in the press, including hem lines, football results,
and butter production in Bangladesh. The predictability of stock market returns is therefore
still an open question.
In an important recent paper, Goyal and Welch (2008) examine the out-of-sample performance of a long list of predictors. They compare forecasts of returns at time t + 1 from
a predictive regression estimated using data up to time t with forecasts based on the historical mean in the same period. They find that the historical mean actually has a better
out-of-sample performance than the traditional predictive regressions of stock returns. They
conclude that “these models would not have helped an investor with access to available information to profitably time the market.” (See also Bossaerts and Hillion (1999).) Several
authors have argued that this is not evidence against predictability per se but only evidence
1

Several authors consider the implications of return predictability for portfolio choice: Brennan, Lagnado,
and Schwartz (1997), Balduzzi and Lynch (1999), Brandt (1999), Campbell and Viceira (1999), Barberis
(2000), Brandt and Santa-Clara (2006), among others.

of the diﬃculty in exploiting predictability with trading strategies (Inoue and Kilian (2004),
Cochrane (2008)). But the Goyal and Welch (2008) challenge remains largely unanswered.
In this paper, we oﬀer an alternative method to predict stock market returns – the
sum-of-the-parts method. We decompose the stock market return into three components
– the dividend yield, the earnings growth rate, and the growth rate in the price-earnings
ratio – and forecast each of these components separately. We forecast the dividend yield
using the currently observed dividend yield. The earnings growth rate is forecasted with
its twenty-year moving average. We use two alternatives to predict the growth rate in the
price-earnings ratio. In the first alternative, we use predictive regressions for the growth rate
in the price-earnings ratio. In the second alternative, we regress the price-earnings ratio on
macro variables and calculate the growth rate that would take the currently observed ratio to
the fitted value. In both cases we use shrinkage to improve the robustness of the predictions.
(Parenthetically, we also show that shrinkage also improves significantly the out-of-sample
performance of traditional predictive regressions.)
We apply the sum-of-the-parts method to the same data as Goyal and Welch (2008) for
the 1927-2007 period.2 The performance of our approach clearly beats both the historical
mean and the traditional predictive regressions. We obtain out-of-sample R-squares (relative
to the historical mean) that range from 0.68% to 1.55% with monthly data and from 4.65%
to 16.72% with yearly data (and non-overlapping observations). This contrasts with outof-sample R-squares ranging from -1.78% to 0.69% (monthly) and from -17.57% to 7.54%
(yearly) obtained on the same data set with the predictive regression approach used by Goyal
and Welch (2008). The results are robust in subsamples.
The economic gains from a trading strategy that uses the sum-of-the-parts method are
substantial. The certainty equivalent gains of applying the sum-of-the-parts method (relative
to a trading strategy based on the historical mean) are always positive and more than 2%
per year for some of the predictive variables. Sharpe ratios are always larger (more than
75% in some cases) than the Sharpe ratio of a strategy based on the historical mean. In
contrast, trading strategies based on predictive regressions would have generated significant
economic losses. We conclude that there is substantial predictability in equity returns and
that it would have been possible to time the market in real time.
The papers closest to ours is Campbell and Thompson (2008). They show that imposing
restrictions on the signs of the coeﬃcients of the predictive regressions modestly improves
out-of-sample performance in both statistical and economic terms. More importantly, they
suggest an alternative decomposition of expected stock returns based on the Gordon growth
model coupled with the assumption that earnings growth is financed from retained earnings.
In our framework, this corresponds to assuming that the price-earnings multiple growth is
expected to be zero and forecasting the earnings growth rate with the product of the return
on equity and the plowback ratio (both estimated with long-term averages). The out-ofsample R-square obtained in our sample period with the Campbell and Thompson (2008)

The sample period in Goyal and Welch (2008) is 1927-2004. We obtain in general slightly better out-ofsample performance using the 1927-2004 period.

method is 0.54% with monthly frequency and 3.24% with yearly frequency. Our out-ofsample forecasting results are substantially better than those in Campbell and Thompson
(2008) for two reasons: our forecast of earnings growth works better and our forecast of the
price-earnings multiple growth has incremental explanatory power.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the methodology.
Section 3 describes the data and presents the results. Section 4 concludes.

2. Methodology
In this section we first describe the traditional predictive regression methodology to forecast
stock market returns. We then describe a simple decomposition of stock returns and how
we forecast each of the components of stock returns.

2.1. Forecasting Returns with Predictive Regressions
The traditional predictive regression methodology regresses stock returns on lagged predictors:3
rt+1 = α + βxt + t+1 .
(1)
In this study, we generate out-of-sample forecasts of the stock market return using a sequence
of expanding windows. Specifically, we take a subsample of the first s observations t = 1, ..., s
of the entire sample of T observations and estimate regression (1). We then use the estimated
coeﬃcients (denoted with hats) together with the value of the predictive variable at time s
to predict the return at time s + 1:
Es (rs+1 ) = α̂ + β̂xs ,

(2)

where Es (·) is the expectation operator conditional on the information available at time s.4
We follow this process for s = s0 , ..., T − 1, thereby generating a sequence of out-of-sample
return forecasts Es (rs+1 ). To start the procedure, we require an initial sample of size s0 (20
years in the empirical application). This process simulates what a forecaster could have done
in real time.
We evaluate the performance of the forecasting exercise with an out-of-sample R-square
similar to the one proposed by Goyal and Welch (2008).5 This measure compares the pre3

Alternatives to predictive regressions based on Bayesian methods, latent variables, analyst forecasts, and
surveys have been suggested by several authors, including Welch (2000), Claus and Thomas (2001), Brandt
and Kang (2004), Pastor and Stambaugh (2008), and Binsbergen and Koijen (2008).

dictive ability of the regression with the historical sample mean (which implicitly assumes
that expected returns are constant):
R2 = 1 −

MSER

MSEM

(3)

MSER is the mean squared error of the out-of-sample predictions from the model:
T −1

MSER =
(rs+1 − Es (rs+1 ))2 ,
T − s0 s=s

and MSEM is the mean squared error of the historical sample mean:
MSEM =

T −1
1 X
(rs+1 − rs )2 ,
T − s0 s=s

(5)

0

where rs is the historical mean of stock market returns up to time s.6 The out-of-sample
R-square will take negative values when the historical sample mean predicts returns better
than the model. Goyal and Welch (2008) oﬀer evidence (that we replicate below) that
predictive regressions using most variables proposed in the literature have poor out-of-sample
performance.
The fitted value from a regression is a noisy estimate of the conditional expectation of
the left-hand side variable. This noise arises from the sampling error inherent in estimating
model parameters using a finite (and often quite limited) sample. Since a regression tries
to minimize squared errors, it tends to overfit in sample. That is, the regression coeﬃcients
are calculated to minimize the sum of squared errors that arise both from the fundamental
relation between the variables and from the sampling noise in the data. Needless to say, the
second component is unlikely to hold robustly out of sample. Ashley (2006) shows that the
unbiased forecast is no longer squared-error optimal in this setting. Instead, the minimumMSE forecast is shown to be a shrinkage of the unbiased forecast toward zero. This process
squares nicely with a prior of no predictability in returns.
We apply a simple shrinkage approach to the predictive regression suggested by Connor
(1997).7 We transform the estimated coeﬃcients of equation (2) by:
s
β̂,
s+i
= rs − β ∗ xs ,

β∗ =

α∗

Goyal and Welch (2008) include a degree-of-freedom adjustment in their R-squared measure which we
do not use. The purpose of adjusting a measure of goodness of fit for the degrees of freedom is to penalize
in-sample overfit which would likely decrease out-of-sample performance. Since the measure we use is already
fully out of sample, there is no need for such adjustment. In any case, for the sample sizes and the number
of explanatory variables used in this study, the degree-of-freedom adjustment would be minimal.
7
Interestingly, shrinkage has been widely used in finance for portfolio optimization problems but not for
return forecasting. See Brandt (2004) and the references therein for portfolio optimization applications of
shrinkage.

where xs is the historical mean of the predictor up to time s. In this way, the slope coeﬃcient
is shrunk towards zero and the intercept changes to preserve the unconditional mean return.
The shrinkage intensity i can be intuitively thought of as the weight given to the prior of no
predictability. It is measured in units of time periods. Thus, if i is set equal to the number
of data periods in the data set s, the slope coeﬃcient is shrunk by half. Connor (1997) shows
that it is optimal to choose i = 1/ρ, where ρ is the expectation of a function of the regression
R-square:
µ
¶
R2
ρ=E
≈ E(R2 ).
(8)
1 − R2

This is the expected explanatory power of the model. We use i = 100 with annual data and
i = 1, 200 with monthly data. This corresponds to giving a weight of 100 years of data to
the prior of no predictability. Alternatively, we can interpret this as an expected R-square
of approximately 1% for predictive regressions with annual data and less than 0.1% with
monthly data which seems reasonable in light of the extant literature. This means that if
we run the predictive regression with 30 years of data, the slope coeﬃcient is shrunk to 23%
(= 30/(100 + 30)) of its estimated magnitude.
Finally, we use these coeﬃcients to forecast the stock market return r as:
Es (rs+1 ) = α∗ + β ∗ xs .

(9)

2.2. Return Components
We decompose the total return of the stock market index into dividend yield and capital
gains:
Pt+1 Dt+1
+
,
(10)
1 + Rt+1 = 1 + CGt+1 + DYt+1 =
Pt
Pt
where Rt+1 is the return obtained from time t to time t + 1; CGt+1 is the capital gain; DYt+1
is the dividend yield; Pt+1 is the stock price at time t + 1; and Dt+1 is the dividend paid
during the return period.8
The capital gain component can be written as follows:
Pt+1
Pt
Pt+1 /Et+1 Et+1
=
Pt /Et
Et
Mt+1 Et+1
=
Mt Et
= (1 + GMt+1 )(1 + GEt+1 ),

1 + CGt+1 =

(11)

8
Fama and French (1998), Arnott and Bernstein (2002), and Ibbotson and Chen (2003) oﬀer alternative
decompositions of returns.

5

where Et+1 denotes earnings per share at time t+1; Mt+1 is the price-earnings ratio; GMt+1 is
the price-earnings ratio growth rate; and GEt+1 is the earnings growth. In this decomposition
we use earnings and the price-earnings ratio but could alternatively use any other price
multiple such as the price-dividend ratio or the price-to-book ratio. Under these alternatives,
we should replace the growth in earnings by the growth rate of the denominator in the
multiple.
The dividend yield can in turn be decomposed as follows:
Dt+1
Pt
Dt+1 Pt+1
=
Pt+1 Pt
= DPt+1 (1 + GMt+1 )(1 + GEt+1 ),

DYt+1 =

(12)

where DPt+1 is the dividend-price ratio (which is distinct from the dividend yield in the
timing of the dividend relative to the price).
Replacing the capital gain and the dividend yield in equation (10), we can write the total
return as the product of the dividend-price ratio and the growth rates of the price-earnings
ratio and of earnings:
1 + Rt+1 = (1 + GMt+1 )(1 + GEt+1 ) + DPt+1 (1 + GMt+1 )(1 + GEt+1 )
= (1 + GMt+1 )(1 + GEt+1 )(1 + DPt+1 ).

(13)

Finally, we can make this expression additive by taking logs:
rt+1 = log(1 + Rt+1 )
= gmt+1 + get+1 + dpt+1 ,

(14)

where lower case variables denote log rates. Thus, log returns can be written as the sum
of the log dividend-price ratio, the growth in earnings, and the growth in the price-earnings
ratio.

2.3. The Sum-of-the-Parts Method
As an alternative to the predictive regressions, we propose forecasting separately the components of the stock market return from expression (14):
Es (rs+1 ) = Es (gms+1 ) + Es (ges+1 ) + Es (dps+1 ) .

(15)

We estimate the expected earnings growth Es (ges+1 ) using a 20-year moving average
of the growth in earnings per share up to time t. This is consistent with the view that
earnings growth is nearly unforecastable (Campbell and Shiller (1988), Fama and French
6

(2002), Cochrane (2008)). The expected dividend-price ratio Es (dps+1 ) is estimated with
the current dividend-price ratio dps . This implicitly assumes that the dividend-price ratio
follows a random walk as Campbell (2008) proposes. We use two alternative methods to
forecast the growth in the price-earnings ratio.
In the first approach, we run a traditional predictive regression – multiple growth regression – with the multiple growth gm (instead of the stock market return r) as the dependent
variable:
(16)
gmt+1 = α + βxt + t+1 ,
to obtain a forecast of the price-multiple growth. We generate out-of-sample forecasts of the
multiple growth using a sequence of expanding windows. We again apply shrinkage to the
estimated coeﬃcients as explained above. We then add the expected earnings growth and
expected dividend-price ratio to obtain the stock market return forecast.
The second approach – multiple reversion – assumes that the price multiple reverts to
its expectation conditional on the state of the economy. We first run a time series regression
of the valuation ratio mt = log Mt = log (Pt /Et ) on the explanatory variable xt :
mt = a + bxt + ut .

(17)

Note that this is a contemporaneous regression since both sides of the equation are known
at the same time. The fitted value of the regression gives us the multiple that historically prevailed, on average, during economic periods characterized by the same level of the
explanatory variable x. The expected value of the multiple at time s is:
Es (ms ) = â + b̂xs .

(18)

If the observed multiple ms is above this expectation, we anticipate a negative growth for the
multiple and vice versa. For example, suppose that the current price-earnings ratio is 10 and
the regression indicates that the expected value of the multiple is 12 given the current value
of the explanatory variable. We would expect a return from this component of 20%. The
estimated regression residual gives an estimate of the expected growth in the price multiple:
−ûs = Es (ms ) − ms
= Es (gms+1 ) .

(19)

In practice, the reversion of the multiple to its expectation is quite slow, and does not
take place in a single period. To take this into account, we run a second regression of the
realized multiple growth on the expected multiple growth using the estimated residuals from
regression equation (18):
gmt+1 = c + db
ut + vt .
(20)

7

We again apply shrinkage to the estimated coeﬃcients as follows:
s b
d,
s+i
= −d∗ gms ,

d∗ =

(21)

c∗

(22)

where gms is the sample mean of the price multiple growth up to time s. This assumes
that the unconditional expectation of the multiple growth is equal to zero. That is, with
no information about the state of the economy, we do not expect the multiple to change.
Finally, we use these coeﬃcients to forecast gm as:
bs .
Es (gms+1 ) = c∗ + d∗ u

(23)

We generate out-of-sample forecasts of the multiple growth using a sequence of expanding
windows.

3. Empirical Analysis
3.1. Data
We use the data set constructed by Goyal and Welch (2008).9 We use monthly data to predict
the monthly stock market return and annual data (non-overlapping) to predict the annual
stock market return.10 The market return is proxied by the S&P 500 index continuously
compounded return including dividends. The sample period is from December 1927 to
December 2007 (or 1927 to 2007 with annual data). Table 1 presents summary statistics of
sock market return (r) and its components (gm, ge, and dp) at monthly and yearly frequency.
The mean monthly stock market return is 9.48% (annualized) and the standard deviation
(annualized) is 19.23% over the whole sample period. Figure 1 plots the monthly cumulative
realized components of stock market return over time.
The predictors of stock returns x are:
Stock variance (SVAR): sum of squared daily stock market returns on S&P 500.
Default return spread (DFR): diﬀerence between long-term corporate bond and long-term
bond returns.
Long-term yield (LTY): long-term government bond yield.
9

The data are drawn from Goyal’s website: http://www.bus.emory.edu/AGoyal. See Goyal and Welch
(2008) for a complete description of the variables and their sources.
10
Goyal and Welch (2008) forecast the equity premium, i.e., the stock market return minus the short-term
riskless interest rate. We obtain qualitatively similar results when we apply our approach to the equity
premium.

8

Long-term return (LTR): long-term government bond return.
Inflation (INFL): growth in the Consumer Price Index with a 1-month lag.
Term spread (TMS): diﬀerence between the long-term government bond yield and the Tbill.
Treasury bill rate (TBL): 3-month Treasury bill rate.
Default yield spread (DFY): diﬀerence between BAA and AAA-rated corporate bond yields.
Net equity expansion (NTIS): ratio of 12-month moving sums of net issues by NYSE listed
stocks to NYSE market capitalization.
Return on equity (ROE): ratio of 12-month moving sums of earnings to book value of equity
for the S&P 500.
Dividend payout ratio (DE): diﬀerence between the log of dividends (12-month moving
sums of dividends paid on S&P 500) and the log of earnings (12-month moving sums
of earnings on S&P 500).
Earnings price ratio (EP): diﬀerence between the log of earnings (12-month moving sums
of earnings on S&P 500) and the log of prices (S&P 500 index price).
Smooth earnings price ratio (SEP): 10-year moving average of earnings price ratio.
Dividend price ratio (DP): diﬀerence between the log of dividends (12-month moving sums
of dividends paid on S&P 500) and the log of prices (S&P 500 index price).
Dividend yield (DY): diﬀerence between the log of dividends (12-month moving sums of
dividends paid on S&P 500) and the log of lagged prices (S&P 500 index price).
Book-to-market (BM): ratio of book value to market value for the Dow Jones Industrial
Average.
We use the same variables to forecast the multiple growth gm in the multiple growth
regression approach, with the exception of the predictors that depend on the stock index
price (EP, SEP, DP, DY, and BM).

3.2. Base Case
In this section we perform an out-of-sample forecasting exercise along the lines of Goyal and
Welch (2008). Table 2 report the results for the whole sample period from December 1927
to December 2007 for monthly frequency (1927 to 2007 for annual frequency). The forecast
period starts 20 years after the beginning of the sample, i.e., in January 1948 (1948 for
annual frequency) and ends in December 2007 (2007 for annual frequency). Panel A reports
9

results for monthly return forecasts and Panel B reports results for annual return forecasts.
Each row of the table considers a diﬀerent forecasting variable, which is identified in the first
and second columns.
The third column of the table reports the in-sample R-square of the full-sample regression.
In panel A, it is clear that most of the variables have modest predictive power for monthly
stock returns over the long sample period considered here. The most successful variable is net
equity expansion with an R-square of 1.07%. All other variables have in-sample R-squares
below 1%.
The remaining columns evaluate the out-of-sample performance of the alternative forecasts using the out-sample R-square relative to the historical mean. The fourth column
reports the out-of-sample R-squares from the traditional predictive regression approach as
in Goyal and Welch (2008). The fifth column reports the out-of-sample R-squares from the
predictive regression with shrinkage. The sixth and seventh columns present out-of-sample
R-squares of forecasting separately the components of the stock market return (the sum-ofthe-parts method). In the sixth column we use the multiple growth regression approach,
while in the seventh column we forecast the price-earning ratio growth using the multiple
reversion approach.
Several conclusions stand out from panel A for monthly return forecasts. First, consistent
with Goyal and Welch (2008), the traditional predictive regression out-of-sample R-squares
are in general negative ranging from -1.78% to -0.05%. The only exception is the net equity
expansion variable that presents an out-of-sample R-square of 0.69%.
Second, shrinkage improves the out-of-sample performance of most predictors. There are
now 8 variables with positive R-squares out of 16 variables. The R-squares, however, are
still modest, with a maximum of 0.53%.
Third, there is a very significant improvement in the out-of-sample forecasting performance when we model separately the components of the stock market return. A considerable
part of the improvement comes from the dividend yield and earnings growth components
alone. We present in the last row of each panel, the out-of-sample R-square of using only
the dividend yield and earnings growth components to forecast stock market returns (i.e.,
ignoring the multiple growth component). We obtain an out-of-sample R-square of 1.32%,
which is much better than the performance of the traditional predictive regressions. Furthermore, we obtain positive out-of-sample R-squares for every variable. The R-squares from
the multiple growth regression (and the dividend-price and earnings growth forecasts) range
from 0.76% (dividend yield) to 1.55% (net equity expansion). Several variables present a
good performance with R-squares above 1.3%, such as the term spread, inflation, T-bill rate,
and the default yield spread.
Finally, there is similar good performance when we forecast the price-earnings growth
using the multiple reversion approach. We present R-squares for only those variables that do
not depend on the stock index price.11 The last column shows that 3 (out 11 variables) have
11

We do not use EP, SEP, DP, DY, and BM in the multiple reversion approach since running a contem-

10

higher R-squares than in the multiple growth regression approach. The R-square coeﬃcients
of the multiple reversion approach range from 0.68% to 1.40%. The last figure in the last
column gives the R-square of just using the historical mean of the price-earnings growth as a
forecast of this component (and separately forecasting dividend-price and earnings growth).
We obtain a remarkable R-square of 1.35%.
Figure 2 shows the realized price-earnings ratio and the fitted value from regression
equation (17) of the price earnings on three diﬀerent explanatory variables: SVAR, TMS,
and TBL. It is remarkable how little of the time variation of the price-earnings ratio is
captured by these explanatory variables. It seems that the changes in the market multiple
over time have little to do with the state of the economy. Importantly for our approach, we
see that the realized multiple reverts to the fitted value. Note that this is not automatically
guaranteed since the forecasted price-earnings ratio is not the fitted value of a regression
estimated ex post but is constructed from a series of regressions estimated with data up to
each point in time. However, the reversion is quite slow and at times takes almost 10 years.
The second regression (20) captures this speed of adjustment. The expected return coming
from multiple reversion varies substantially over time and takes both positive and negative
values.
Figure 3 shows the diﬀerent components of the expected stock market return for the
same three predictive variables. We see substantial time variation of expected stock market
returns over time, from zero (actually slightly negative) around the year 2000 to almost
1.5% per month in the 1950s and the 1970s. All three components of expected returns show
time variation. The dividend-price ratio and expected earnings growth display low-frequency
movements, each of the order of 0.2% to 0.3% per month. The expected multiple changes
more with values between -0.3% and 0.3% per month at times.
Figure 4 compares the expected return from the sum-of-the-parts method (with multiple
reversion) with traditional predictive regressions for the same three predictors and with the
historical mean. We see that there are large diﬀerences between the three forecasts. The
expected returns using predictive regressions change drastically depending on the predictor
used whereas there is very little change in the sum-of-the-parts method estimates.
Figure 5 shows cumulative out-of-sample R-squares for both the sum-of-parts method
and predictive regressions. The sum-of-parts method dominates over most of the sample
with good fit, although there has been a drop in predictability over time.
We now turn to the annual stock market return forecasts results in panel B of Table 2.
We use non-overlapping returns to avoid the concerns with the measurement of R-squares
with overlapping returns pointed out by Valkanov (2003) and Boudoukh, Richardson, and
Whitelaw (2008). Our findings for monthly return forecasts are also valid for annual return
forecasts: forecasting separately the components of stock market returns delivers out-ofsample R-squares significantly higher than traditional predictive regressions. The improvement is even more striking at the annual frequency. Additionally, with annual return foreporaneous regression of the price-earnings ratio on other multiples does not make sense.

11

casts, the multiple reversion approach presents the best performance (relative to the multiple
growth regression) in a significant number of cases. This finding is not entirely surprising as
the speed of the multiple mean reversion is quite low.
The traditional predictive regression R-squares are in general negative at the annual
frequency (13 out of 16 variables) consistent with Goyal and Welch (2008). The R-squares
range from -17.57% to 7.54%. Using shrinkage with the traditional prediction regression
gives eleven variables with positive R-squares. Forecasting separately the components of
stock market returns dramatically improves the performance. We obtain an R-square of
13.43% (last row in table) when we use only the dividends and earnings growth components
to forecast stock market returns. When we add the forecast of the price-earnings growth
from a predictive regression, we obtain an even higher R-square for some variables: 14.31%
(earnings price) and 14.40% (default return spread). When we alternatively add the forecast
of the price-earnings growth from the multiple reversion approach, the R-squares reach values
of 16.72% (long-term bond return) and 15.04% (term spread).
It is instructive to compare our results with Campbell and Thompson (2008). We
can describe their method using our equation (15) with Et (gmt+1 ) = 0 and Et (get+1 ) =
[1 − Et (Dt+1 /Et+1 )] Et (ROEt+1 ). The last component assumes that earnings growth corresponds to retained earnings times the return on equity and implicitly assumes that there are
no external financing flows and that the marginal investment opportunities earn the same
as the average return on equity. Campbell and Thompson (2008) use historical averages to
forecast the payout ratio and the return on equity. We implement their method in our sample and the out-of-sample R-square is 0.54% with monthly frequency and 3.24% with yearly
frequency.12 Our method using only the dividend yield and earnings growth components
gives significantly higher R-squares: 1.32% with monthly frequency and 13.43% with yearly
frequency. When we include the multiple growth component, the R-squares are even higher
as shown in Table 2.
An alternative forecast of earnings is obtained from analyst estimates drawn from I/B/E/S
and aggregated across all S&P 500 stocks. We use this forecast to calculate both the price
earnings ratio and the earnings growth. Panel A of Table 3 reports the results for the sample period from January 1982 (when I/B/E/S data starts) to December 2007 with monthly
frequency. In this exercise we begin forecasts 5 years after the sample start, rather than 20
years as we did before, due to the shorter sample. Panel B replicates the analysis of Table
2 for the same sample period for comparison. We find that analyst forecasts work quite
well with out-of-sample R-squares between 1.67% and 3.09%. However, using our previous
approach works even better in this sample period, with out-of-sample R-squares between
2.81% and 4.66%.
12

Campbell and Thompson (2008) use a longer sample period from 1891 to 2005 (with forecasts begining in
1927) and obtain out-of-sample R-squares of 0.63% with monthly frequency and 4.35% with yearly frequency.
We thank John Campbell for letting us use the data and programs used in their study for this comparison.

3.3. Subperiods
We have examined so far the out-of-sample performance of the alternative approaches to
forecast stock market returns using the full-sample period from December 1927 to December
2007. Goyal and Welch (2008) find that predictive regressions have a particularly poor
performance in the last decades. In this section, we repeat the performance analysis using two
subsamples that divide the full-sample period in halves: from December 1927 to December
1976 and from December 1956 to December 2007. As in the previous analysis, forecasts begin
20 years after the subsample start, i.e., January 1948 in the first subsample and January 1977
in the second subsample. Table 4 presents the results. Panels A.1 and A.2 present the results
using monthly returns and Panels B.1 and B.2 using annual returns (non-overlapping).
The out-of-sample performance of the alternative approaches is better in the first subsample (that includes the Great Depression and World War II) than in the second subsample
(that includes the oil shock of the 1970s and the internet bubble of the end of the 20th
Century). Consistent with Goyal and Welch (2008), there is a decline over time in the
out-of-sample performance meaning that the variables are not outperforming the historical
mean as significantly as in the earlier years of the sample. We find that the sum-of-the-parts
method dominates the traditional predictive regressions in both subsamples.
Using monthly data, the out-of-sample R-squares of the traditional predictive regression
are in general negative, ranging from -2.20% to 0.37% in the first subperiod and from -2.09%
to 0.53% in the second subperiod. Net equity expansion has the best performance in both
subperiods.
In both subperiods, there is a very significant improvement in the out-of-sample forecasting performance when we model separately the components of the stock market return. As
before, a considerable part of the improvement comes from the dividend yield and earnings
growth components alone: out-of-sample R-square of 1.80% in the first subperiod and 0.98%
in the second subperiod. This is much better than the performance of the traditional predictive regressions. The maximum R-squares using the multiple growth regression are 2.29%
in the first subperiod and 1.44% in the second subperiod.
There is similar performance when we forecast the price-earnings growth using the multiple reversion approach. The maximum R-squares are roughly 2% (9 out of 11 variables in
the first subperiod) and 1% (in the second subperiod).
At the annual frequency, we find that most variables have worse performance in the
most recent subperiod, but the sum-of-the-parts method dominates the traditional predictive
regressions in both subsamples. Using annual data, the out-of-sample R-squares of the
traditional predictive regressions are in general negative in both subperiods. In contrast,
forecasting separately the components of stock market returns delivers positive out-of-sample
R-squares in both subperiods. As before, a considerable part of the improvement comes
from the dividend yield and earnings growth components alone. We obtain out-of-sample Rsquares of 14.66% in the first subperiod and 12.10% in the second subperiod. The maximum
13

R-squares using the multiple growth regression are more than 20% in the first subperiod and
15% in the second subperiod. This is much better than the performance of the traditional
predictive regressions.
Overall, the result that the sum-of-the-parts method beats the predictive regression (and
the historical mean) to forecast stock market returns is robust in subsamples.

3.4. Trading Strategies
To assess the economic importance of the diﬀerent approaches to forecast returns, we run
out-of-sample trading strategies. Each period, we use the various estimates of expected
returns to calculate the Markowitz optimal weight on the stock market:
ws =

Es (rs+1 ) − rfs+1
γσ2s

(24)

where rfs+1 denotes the risk-free return from time s to s + 1 (which is known at time s); γ is
the risk-aversion coeﬃcient that we assume to be 2; and σ 2s is the variance of the stock market
returns that we estimate using all the available data up to each forecasting period.13 The
only thing that varies across portfolio policies are the estimates of the expected returns from
predictive regressions and the sum-of-the-parts method. Note that these portfolio policies
could have been implemented in real time with data available at the time of the decision.14
We then calculate the portfolio return at the end of each period as:
rps+1 = ws rs+1 + (1 − ws )rfs+1 .

(25)

We iterate this process until the end of the sample T , thereby obtaining a time series of
returns for each trading strategy.
To evaluate the performance of the strategies, we calculate their certainty equivalent
return:
γ
ce = rp − σ 2 (rp).
(26)
2
where rp is the sample mean portfolio return and σ 2 (rp) is the sample variance portfolio
return. This is the risk-free return that a mean-variance investor with risk-aversion γ (= 2)
would consider equivalent to investing in the strategy. The certainty equivalent can also be
interpreted as the fee that the investor would be willing to pay to exploit the information in
each forecast model. We also calculate the Sharpe ratio (annualized) for each strategy.
13

Given the average stock market excess return and variance, a mean-variance investor with risk-aversion
coeﬃcient of 2 would allocate the entire wealth to the stock market. This is therefore consistent with
equilibrium with this representative investor. We obtain qualitatively similar results using other values for
the risk-aversion coeﬃcient.
14
In unreported results, we obtain in general slightly better certainty equivalents and Shape ratio gains if
we impose portfolio constraints preventing investors from shorting stocks (ws ≥ 0%) and taking more than
50% of leverage (ws ≤ 150%).

14

Table 5 reports the certainty equivalent gains (in percentage) relative to investing based
on the historical mean forecast. Using the historical mean, the certainty equivalents are
7.4% and 6.4% per year at the monthly and annual frequency. Using traditional predictive
regressions leads to losses relative to the historical mean in most cases. Applying shrinkage
to the traditional predictive regression slightly improves the performance of the trading
strategies. The sum-of-the-parts method always leads to economic gains in both the multiple
growth regression and multiple reversion approaches. In fact, using only the dividend yield
and earnings growth components we obtain an economic gain of 1.79% per year. The largest
gains in the multiple growth regression and multiple reversion approaches are 2.33% and
1.72% per year. We obtain similar economic gains using annual (and non-overlapping)
returns.
Table 6 reports the gains in Sharpe ratio (annualized) relative to investing with the
historical mean. Using the historical mean, the Sharpe ratios are 0.45% and 0.30% at the
monthly and annual frequency. We find once again that using the traditional predictive
regressions leads to losses relative to the historical mean in most cases. Applying shrinkage
to the traditional predictive regression significantly improves the performance of the trading
strategies. Most important, the sum-of-the-parts method always leads to Sharpe ratio gains
in both the multiple growth regression and multiple reversion alternatives. In fact, using only
the dividend yield and earnings growth components, we obtain a Sharpe ratio gain of 67%.
The maximum gains in the multiple growth regression and multiple reversion approaches
are 73% and 53%. We obtain similar Sharpe ratio gains using annual (and non-overlapping)
returns.
Finally, our gains in terms of certainty equivalent and Sharpe ratio are higher than the
gains obtained using the Campbell and Thompson (2008) approach in our sample: 1.5% gain
in certainty equivalent and 27% gain in Sharpe ratio.

4. Conclusion
We abandon predictive regressions of total stock returns in favor of separately forecasting
the capital gains and dividend yield components of market returns – the sum-of-the-parts
method. We apply our method to forecast stock markets returns out-of-sample in the 19272007 period. Our method leads to statistically and economically significant gains for investors. These findings contrast with Goyal and Welch (2008) and revive the long literature
on market predictability. The out-of-sample performance of the sum-of-the-parts method
is better than the performance of the historical mean and of predictive regressions. Predictive regressions perform poorly because estimated parameters are unstable over time as
shown by Campbell and Thompson (2008). Most of the gains in performance in our method
comes from combining a steady-state forecast for earnings growth with the market’s current valuation. We get a further improvement in predictive power from the multiple growth
forecast.

15

Our results have important consequences for corporate finance and investments. Our
forecasts of the equity premium can be used for cost-of-capital calculations in project and
firm valuation. The results presented suggest that discount rates and corporate decisions
should be more closely dependent on market conditions. In the investments world, we show
that there are important gains from timing the market. Of course, to the extent that we are
capturing excessive predictability rather than risk premia, the very success of our analysis
will eventually destroy its usefulness. Once a suﬃciently large number of investors follow
our approach to predict returns, they will impact market prices and again make returns
unpredictable.

Table 3

Forecasts of Stock Market Returns: Analysts Earnings Forecasts
This table presents in-sample and out-of-sample R-square (in percentage) for stock market returns forecasts at
the monthly (non-overlapping) frequency. The in-sample R-square is estimated over the full sample period. The
out-of-sample R-square compares the forecast error versus the forecast error of the historical mean. Panel A uses
analyst earnings forecasts to calculate gm and ge. Panel B uses actual earnings to calculate ge and gm. The sample
period is from January 1982 to December 2007. Forecasts begin 5 years after the sample start.

This table presents out-of-sample portfolio choice results at the monthly and annual (non-overlapping) frequency.
The numbers are the certainty equivalent gains (in percentage) relative to the historical mean. The utility function
is E(Rp ) − (γ/2)V ar(Rp ) with a risk-aversion coeﬃcient of γ = 2. All numbers are annualized (monthly certainty
equivalents gains are multiplied by 12). The sample period is from December 1927 to December 2007. Forecasts
begin 20 years after the sample start.
