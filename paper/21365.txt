Accounting for Adaptation in the Economics of Happiness
Miles Kimball, Ryan Nunn, and Dan Silverman
NBER Working Paper No. 21365
July 2015
JEL No. C1,D6,I31
ABSTRACT
Reported happiness provides a potentially useful way to evaluate unpriced goods and events; but measures
of subjective well-being (SWB) often revert to the mean after responding to events, and this hedonic
adaptation creates challenges for interpretation. Previous work tends to estimate time-invariant effects
of events on happiness. In the presence of hedonic adaptation, this restriction can lead to biases, especially
when comparing events to which people adapt at different rates. Our paper provides a flexible, extensible
econometric framework that accommodates adaptation and permits the comparison of happiness-relevant
life events with dissimilar hedonic adaptation paths. We present a method that is robust to individual
fixed effects, imprecisely-dated data, and permanent consequences. The method is used to analyze
a variety of events in the Health and Retirement Study panel. Many of the variables studied have substantial
consequences for subjective well-being - consequences that differ greatly in their time profiles.

Introduction

In recent years, researchers have increasingly turned to survey data on subjective well-being (happiness) to investigate a wide range of economic questions. Happiness data have been used to study
preferences over inflation and unemployment (Di Tella et al., 2001), the consequences of excise taxes
(Gruber and Mullainathan, 2005), the externalities of neighbors’ higher earnings (Luttmer, 2005),
the progress of women (Stevenson and Wolfers, 2009), and the effect of health on preferences for
consumption (Finkelstein et al., 2008), to take just a few examples. While the use of happiness data
is often controversial, measures of an individual’s recent mood or life-satisfaction have important
potential for social science. Taken simply as an outcome, an individual’s emotional state or level
of satisfaction may be an important aspect of their well-being. Interpreted as information about
utility, happiness data provide an opportunity to infer an individual’s preferences under circumstances, such as the presence of externalities, non-market goods, or cognitive biases, where choices
and prices alone will typically be inadequate. The potential value of these measures motivates the
development of tools for rigorous economic analysis of happiness data.
This paper provides analytic tools to account for “hedonic adaptation,” a feature of happiness
data that makes their economic interpretation more difficult. Hedonic adaptation refers to an aspect
of the dynamic response of happiness to changes in life-circumstances; the magnitude of the response
decreases as the change fades into the past. In a variety of studies, there is evidence that happiness
responds in expected ways to the arrival of both good and bad events, but individuals return to
their prior levels of mood with surprising thoroughness and speed.1 In a canonical example, people
are much less happy upon the arrival of a serious health problem (paraplegia, renal failure) but
eventually appear to adapt and reveal measured happiness at or near normal levels (Riis et al., 2005).
The idea that happiness quickly adapts to changes in income has been central to investigations of
the Easterlin Paradox, but it is common for economic analyses of happiness data to leave hedonic
adaptation unmodeled.
We develop and estimate, using panel data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS),
a parsimonious model of hedonic adaptation that allows life events to have both transitory and
permanent effects on subjective well-being (SWB). The model is based on a theory of happiness,
1

Frederick and Loewenstein (1999) offer a review of this evidence. Diener et al. (2006) review evidence on the
limits of hedonic adaptation.

2

Kimball and Willis (2006), that interprets the impulse response of SWB to an event as indicating
the importance of that event for lifetime utility. That theory suggests that the rate of hedonic
adaptation should depend on the particular type of event, so we estimate an event-specific rate
at which the transitory effect decays. While the formulation is flexible, it provides a single, interpretable statistic by which to compare the overall SWB effects of life events with very different
paths of hedonic adaptation.
The estimates show that the model fits the HRS data well and that accounting for hedonic
adaptation can have qualitative effects on the inference drawn from happiness data. We find, for
example, that estimates of the relative rank of important life events change substantially depending
on whether adaptation affects are modeled. For instance, a commonly-used regression specification
implies that unemployment is worse for SWB than either a heart attack or cancer. By contrast,
when adaptation is taken into account, both health events are revealed to be more serious than
unemployment. Likewise, accounting for adaptation downgrades the significance of life insurance
for happiness in the aftermath of widowhood.
The methods presented here also reveal important differences across events in the paths of SWB
that follow them. As an example, we investigate parental death, which has negligible, statistically
insignificant SWB effects when estimated using a common method that does not account for adaptation. This masks a very large, but short-lived, initial drop in happiness after a parent’s death.
More generally, existing work that characterizes events as having only a single, permanent effect
on SWB (what we term a “pooled regression” approach) does not fully exploit the panel nature of
available data. This is especially relevant in light of our finding that life events have widely differing hedonic consequences, both in magnitude and in composition (e.g., temporary vs. permanent
effects).
The figures below preview how the method characterizes the dynamics of SWB, and how it
allows inference about the transitory effects of life events. Proceeding clockwise from the top left,
the figure shows the estimated dynamics of SWB in response to widowing when the deceased had
life insurance, widowing when the deceased did not, death of a child, and death of a mother. In
these figures, the method quantifies how events differ in the size and persistence of their effects on
SWB. It also allows inference about the ability of financial resources to ease the SWB effects of
widowing (seemingly little) and about how well-being recovers from the loss of a parent (quickly

As in the rest of the SWB literature, the interpretation of these figures will depend on whether
happiness data are viewed as providing information about utility or as representing outcomes of
intrinsic interest analogous to health or income. In either case, we offer a convenient and tractable
econometric method for making use of these data in the presence of hedonic adaptation.
The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. First, in the next section, we discuss the
related literature in greater detail, with special emphasis on the econometric approach taken in
previous work. Section 3, presents the model and multiple variants of the baseline specification.
That section also develops a procedure for comparing our results to previous work. In Section 4
and Section 5, we discuss data and results, with a discussion and conclusion following.

Related Literature

The SWB literature was advanced by early papers like Andrews and Withey (1976), Bradburn
(1969), Campbell et al. (1976) that explored the potential usefulness of survey questions on happiness. As the literature matured, some of challenges of interpreting SWB data became evident.
Schwarz and Strack (1999) and Schwarz (1987), for example describe some of the difficulties of
interpreting reported happiness data, including the temporary and context-dependent nature of
the reports. Subsequent research has also argued that SWB is not always best conceived of as a
straightforward proxy for utility; Benjamin et al. (2012) show evidence for systematic discrepancies
between SWB and revealed preference utility. Kimball and Willis (2006) develop a theory that
reconciles the two.
Within the literature on SWB, hedonic adaptation has been the focus of substantial recent
work.2 If adaptation and relative income are important in the determination of SWB, a number
of implications follow for cross-sectional individual and national data, as well as optimal taxation,
consumption, and other topics (Clark et al., 2008b). Concerns about “set points” (SWB levels
to which individuals eventually return after a disturbance) and the measurement of happiness are
explored in Diener et al. (2006). Clark et al. (2008a) looks for permanent SWB responses to
various events, generally not finding significant effects; Lucas (2007), by contrast, finds evidence of
incomplete adaptation. Bottan and Truglia (2011) present evidence indicating that happiness itself
is positively autocorrelated. Oswald and Powdthavee (2008) and Powdthavee (2009) investigate
adaptation in the wake of disability and widowing. They acknowledge the importance of hedonic
adaptation but emphasize the mutability and heterogeneity of set points.
Furthermore, data on adaptation is likely to be more useful than data on SWB levels because
levels are multi-dimensional (incorporating both life evaluation and temporary mood, for example)
and difficult to compare across individuals. Dolan and Kahneman (2008) and Kimball and Willis
(2006) offer theories attentive to dynamics and consistent with hedonic adaptation that can further
structure the analysis. In Kimball and Willis (2006), intra-person variation in affect, as opposed
to life evaluation, provides comprehensive information about the reaction to life events. Our data
permit analysis consistent with this theory, facilitating the comparison of various life events. Unlike

many other sources of SWB data, the Health and Retirement Study panel allows for examination of
intra-person changes in affect, abstracting from reporting idiosyncrasies and differences in baseline
mood.
The choice of SWB measure may matter as well. The German Socioeconomic Panel, for instance,
provides information on life satisfaction (e.g., Headey et al., 2010, Lucas et al., 2004) rather than
the affect measure we use from the Health and Retirement Study. Benjamin et al. (2014) provide
evidence that individuals value a variety of SWB dimensions, including autonomy, health, social
status, etc. The authors point to the difficulty of aggregating across these dimensions and across
individuals. Luhmann et al. (2012) conduct a meta-analysis of SWB studies, finding that adaptation
and effect sizes differ across both life events and the SWB measure used. Specifically, “cognitive
well-being” (overall life evaluation) is generally more affected by life events than ”affective wellbeing” (mood).

2.1

Leading Econometric Models

Several authors estimate the impact of life events on happiness using a cross-sectional regression
that includes indicator variables for various events. In particular, Deaton et al. (2008) use the
following specification with individual-level data from the Gallup World Poll:

Hit = αc + Xit βX + Yit βY + 1it β1 + it ,

(1)

where H is a SWB measure, αc is a vector of country fixed effects, X is a vector of demographic
variables, Y is log income, and 1 is a vector of dummies for the death of a family member from
a given disease in the last twelve months. Without the possibility of individual fixed effects, the
authors rely on the assumption that “baseline mood” (i.e., the SWB level reported before an event)
is not systematically different across respondents in a way that is endogenous to the specification.
Other papers exploit country-level data. As mentioned previously, Di Tella et al. (2001) run
regressions of the following form.

LSct = αc + Uct βX + Πct βI + ct ,
where LS is a modified life satisfaction measure, U is the unemployment rate, Π is the inflation
6

rate, and αc is a vector of country fixed effects. Finkelstein et al. (2008) utilize individual panel
data and estimate the following equation, among others:

Hit = αi + Xit βX + Yit βY + 1it β1 + (1it ∗ Yit )βint + it ,

(2)

where H is a SWB measure, αc is a vector of country fixed effects, X is a vector of demographic
variables, Y is log income, and 1 is a vector of dummies for whether a respondent has ever had a
particular disease. The effect of the interaction between income and health events is given by βint .
However, this panel approach still fails to distinguish immediate consequences from enduring effects.
Because there is evidence that adaptation occurs, we prefer a method that allows for dynamic
happiness responses. Further, we find that life events vary significantly in the ratio of temporary
to permanent happiness effects and dynamic methods are necessary to properly compare them.

Model

The model formulated here is based on a theory of happiness, Kimball and Willis (2006), that
interprets the impulse response of SWB to an event as indicating the importance of that event
for lifetime utility. Kimball and Willis (2006) are skeptical about the level of happiness as a
contemporaneous indicator of utility; feeling happy is only one of many commodities that people
care about. In this view, the transitory response of happiness to events is something of interest in
its own right, not just a nuisance.
The specific formulation of the model aims to capture the dynamic response of happiness to
events in a flexible, tractable, and parsimonious way. This motivates modeling hedonic adaptation
by exponential decay – which will prove to fit the HRS data well.3 The decay rate is estimated
simultaneously with the intensity of the initial response of happiness.

3.1

Baseline specification

The simplest form of our dynamic equation is given below. It decomposes the cumulative happiness
response into an immediate, temporary effect that decays, and a permanent effect that persists
3
A nonparametric approach makes excessive demands on the (often sparse and incomplete) data, but a pooled
cross-sectional or fixed effects regression fails to recognize the substantial and nonlinear adaptation characteristic of
the data. Our specification is nonlinear but quick to estimate.

indefinitely. The temporary effect is assumed to vanish exponentially at rate δ.4 Since many life
events have important consequences for income and wealth or are related to income and wealth
levels, we include the log levels of household income and wealth as covariates. The estimating
equation is given by

temporary effect

where H is a SWB measure ranging 0 − 100, χ is a dummy for respondents who have experienced
a given event, t is the time that happiness is observed, t0 is the time the event occurs, βY is the
income effect, βW is the wealth effect, βP is the permanent effect, βT is the temporary effect, αi
is the person fixed effect, and δ is the rate of decay of the shock.5 Since δ enters the equation
nonlinearly, we use nonlinear least squares (NLS) estimation. The NLS estimator is given by

θ̂ = arg min
θ

N
X

[yi − f (xi ; θ)]2 ,

i=1

where f (xt ; θ) is the nonlinear model, y is the endogenous variable, N is the number of observations,
and θ is the parameter vector.
With some SWB-relevant events, it may be the case that the likelihood of occurrence is related
to baseline mood. This may be the case even if the event is unanticipated by the respondent. For
instance, health problems such as heart attacks may be induced by stress, which could itself imply
lower baseline mood. Since the healthy respondents report higher SWB, the effect of a heart attack
will be over-estimated with a specification that fails to account for the already-lower baseline mood
of respondents who are about to have heart attacks. To account for these differences in baseline
mood, we include individual-specific fixed effects.

3.2

Comparability with previous estimates

For some purposes, it may be interesting to consider the cumulative impact of an event. In particular, some of the estimates in previous work (along the lines of equations 1 and 2) have an
interpretation as the cumulative SWB consequence of an event. For comparability with these re4

We experimented with less restrictive specifications but found no evidence of non-exponential decay.
All specifications also contains a quadratic in respondent age, not shown.

8

sults, we adapt our baseline specification, equation 3, by integrating to find the total effect. For an
individual with d annual mortality risk and interest rate r, the “area under the curve” will have
the following form:
Z

∞

(βP e−(d+r)(s−t0 ) + βT e−(δ+d+r)(s−t0 ) )ds =

t0

βP
βT
+
d+r d+r+δ

(4)

This formulation gives a single statistic that can be used to rank events by their hedonic
importance. It also allows for comparison of our dynamic results with the previous literature’s
static estimates, since both are measures of a cumulative hedonic effect. Following previous work,
the fixed effects regression

Hit = αi + Yit βY + 1it β1 + it ,

(5)

is conducted to make this comparison of our results with the usual linear specification. 1it is an
“absorbing state” indicator, which means that it is set to 1 for all observations after the initial event
occurrence. This is consistent with some of the previous SWB literature (e.g., Finkelstein et al.,
2008) and aims to capture a cumulative SWB effect. Were 1it to equal 1 only in the initial event
occurrence observation, β1 would capture only a portion of the temporary SWB consequences, and
would not be comparable to our cumulative results.
The chief virtue of our baseline specification is its ability to separately identify temporary
and permanent SWB effects. While important in its own right, mean reversion also complicates
estimation of the cumulative happiness effect. In equation 5, β1 is only identical to βP in equation 3
if βT = 0. For βT > 0, equation 5 may imply a different estimate of the cumulative SWB effect than
equation 3. Consider the ordinal ranking of SWB-relevant events by β1 . Since the specification of
equation 5 makes no use of time since occurrence, this parameter will depend on the probability
that a respondent subsequently leaves the sample, which may differ across events. For example, an
event that is substantially mean-reverting may be associated with subsequent SWB observations
over many years. Another event, with the same balance of temporary and permanent effects, may
have relatively few subsequent SWB observations. Assume, for specificity, that both temporary
and permanent effects are negative in sign. For the event with few post-occurrence observations,
β1 will be estimated to be larger in magnitude, because the temporarily depressed SWB values
9

just after event occurrence will dominate the data. By contrast, βT , βP , and by implication
βcumulative =

βT
d+r+δ

+

βP
d+r

do not depend on these factors, but are estimated consistently if the

underlying model is correct. Rankings of SWB-relevant events based on the latter expression will
then be different, in general, than a ranking based on β1 .
When there is a permanent component to the change in happiness after an event, two different
interpretations of these results correspond to two different views on happiness. If happiness is a
contemporaneous indicator of utility, then the total area under the curve relative to the initial
baseline is of interest. By contrast, in the Kimball-Willis (2006) theory, the extra lifetime utility
from the permanent component is already accounted for in the magnitude and duration of the
transitory component. So, to avoid double-counting, only the area under the transitory component
should be counted in gauging the importance of an event. We report both measures.

3.3

Allows for various sorts of decompositions

One interesting extension of this method involves subjective life expectancy. Some life events, in
particular health events like heart attacks and strokes, will in general have important consequences
for life expectancy. The original dynamic specification, equation 3, can be modified to examine
the role of subjective life expectancy changes in creating the observed hedonic effects. A particular
implementation is given below:

Hit = αi + Yit βY + χi 1(t >= t0 )[βP + (βT + η∆SLE)e−δ(t−t0 ) ] + it ,

(6)

where SLE is a constructed measure of subjective life expectancy, denominated in years, and η is
the temporary effect of changes in subjective life expectancy.

3.4

Anticipation

In order for our interpretation of the baseline specification to be correct, it must be the case that
the “news” component of event happiness consequences does not occur prior to the event itself. In
other words, respondents must not learn of and (in terms of subjective well-being) react to an event
that has yet to occur. Since this assumption is likely violated in a number of cases, we include as
a control a dummy for SWB in the six-month period prior to an event. This is done for all the

10

events that are precisely dated. If news about the event generates a change in SWB prior to the
event date, our modified specification will correctly capture the consequences of the event itself (as
opposed to news of the event) in the parameters βP , βT , δ.

3.5

Sparse data

Another advantage of our method is that it can be easily modified to handle infrequently-measured
data. With all the HRS data, we posit an underlying continuous-time data generating process, with
the happiness data only observed periodically (every two years in the core of the HRS). Some of the
SWB-relevant events are dated precisely to the month in which they occur, others are known only to
the calendar year in which they occurred (with extra information for same-year events coming from
the fact that they must be before the survey date), while still others can only be dated as occurring
sometime between waves of survey data. To deal with this, we assume a uniform distribution of
the logically possible interval of time in which an event could have occurred given the data. We
time-aggregate the equations for the continuous-time data generating process to obtain a nonlinear
estimating equation. The key identifying assumption is that there are no important transitory
movements in baseline mood after an event that are correlated with the event itself.
For instance, events that are dated only to the year are estimated by the following equation.
m

Hit = αi +Yit βY +χi 1(y >= y0 )[βP +βT e

where y is the year happiness is measured, y0 is the year an event occurred, and m is the interview
month in which happiness is measured.6 The “post-year” component isolates the possibility that
happiness is observed in a year that follows the year in which the event occurred, integrating over
the entire distribution of possible months, while the “same-year” component integrates over the
distribution that is possible given that an event must have occurred prior to the interview month
in which happiness was recorded.
For events that are dated only to the wave,
6
By contrast to the precisely-dated case, t0 is now constructed with the assumption that the event occurred in
January of a given year. The subsequent “post-year” and “same-year” components make adjustments consistent with
an underlying assumption of a uniform distribution of the possible event occurence interval.

Data

We use data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), which conducts a biennial representative
survey of Americans over the age of 50. The resulting panel data spanning the years 1992 through
2012 includes detailed happiness reports and information on a rich set of important life events.
Although there are important panel data sets for subjective well-being for other countries (most
notably the German Socioeconomic Panel and the British Household Panel Study), for the U.S.,
the HRS is the only survey with a long panel of repeated observations on subjective well-being. In
addition to the core HRS waves, we use the Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old
(AHEAD), the Children of the Depression Age (CODA), and the War Babies cohorts7 . For some
of the variables, we use a version of this data provided by the RAND Center for the Study of Aging
that includes some additional imputations.
Each wave of the HRS asks respondents the following questions: “Now think about the past
week and the feelings you have experienced. Please tell me if each of the following was true for
you much of the time this past week: a) You felt you were happy b) You felt sad c) You enjoyed
life d) You felt depressed.” We treat the binary variables “happy” and “enjoylife”, along with the
reverse-coded “notsad” and “notdepressed”, as four indicators of the underlying latent value of
happiness at the time of the interview. Thus, we treat the probability of answering in the positive
direction for each of these variables as an increasing function of latent happiness.
HRS respondents are questioned about many health and other important life events in each
wave of the survey. Some of these events are precisely dated to the month but some are only
known to have occurred at some point between waves. Examples of the latter include episodes of
incontinence, congestive heart failure, hip fractures, cataract surgery, births of grandchildren, and
7

The AHEAD cohort was initially part of a distinct study and includes respondents born before 1924. CODA and
the War Babies cohorts were added in 1998 and includes respondents born 1924-1930, and 1942-1947, respectively.

12

changes in social isolation. Widowing, heart attacks, strokes, cancer, retirement, unemployment,
and entry into nursing homes are dated to the precise month. The Psychosocial Leave-Behind
(PLB) component of the HRS provides retrospective information on a number of other events with
dating only to the year: death of a child, serious illness of a family member, drug and alcohol
addiction of family members, physical assault, labor market discrimination, police discrimination,
job search, changes in neighborhood safety, and others.
Measures of household income and wealth are available for all waves, which we include as controls
throughout. The HRS includes life insurance status, allowing us to partition the hedonic response to
widowing. Interestingly, there are also questions about life expectancy for many of the respondents.
We use these to construct a measure of subjective life expectancy, then decompose the temporary
response to an event into a component related to changes in subjective life expectancy and a
residual, which becomes the standard βT coefficient. The subjective life expectancy (SLE) measure
is constructed in the following way. For certain waves, respondents are asked what probability
they assign to their living to a particular age, where said age depends on the current age of the
respondent. We linearly interpolate the survival probability for all future years, then calculate SLE
as the expectation of years remaining.

Results

Because the HRS is a panel, we are able to conduct fixed effects estimation. Without individual
fixed effects, any heterogeneity in baseline happiness might bias estimation. For example, if heart
attacks tend to happen to people with lower baseline happiness, our approach (modified to exclude
fixed effects) would recover an exaggerated estimate of the permanent effect. With fixed effects,
variation in baseline happiness is not confounded with the enduring consequence of a life event.
As discussed in Section 4, the HRS provides four closely-related variables pertaining to a respondent’s mood at the time of interview. Our preferred approach uses the sum of the (appropriatelycoded) variables as the dependent variable in all our specifications. In preliminary work, we compared multiple approaches to the use of HRS subjective well-being variables. We obtained broadly
similar results when conducting probit estimation with individual SWB variables.
Table 1 gives estimates for βP , βT , and δ using our dynamic method for events dated to the

13

month (widowing, heart attack, stroke, cancer, unemployment, nursing home entry, and retirement).
Standard errors are all heteroskedasticity-robust. Figure 2a-3c illustrates the results graphically,
showing the predicted values of both a non-parametric regression and an “impulse response” corresponding to our baseline specification for events dated to the month.8 The impulse responses are

effects. Interestingly, strokes have both the largest permanent effect, relative to temporary (as well
as the largest permanent effect in absolute value), which is plausibly consistent with the enduring
disability often suffered by stroke victims. The temporary effect of cancer is less than one-third as
large as the temporary effect of widowing.
Regressions concerning the other events for which we have precise timing information - unemployment, nursing home entry, and retirement - yield reasonable estimates. Unemployment has a
negative temporary and effect that is roughly in line with the magnitude of the aforementioned
health problems. Entry into a nursing home produces even larger temporary and permanent reduction in SWB. Involuntary retirement produces a smaller negative SWB effect that dissipates
almost entirely. Both nursing home entry and retirement are perhaps less plausibly exogenous than

Familial death and dissolution are also quite relevant to happiness, especially in the short-term.
More generally, it is notable how short-lived the happiness consequences of some events appear: half
the temporary effect of a parent’s death has disappeared by two months, while widowing requires
about a year for the same recovery. The estimated depreciation rates are themselves of interest.
For all the precisely-dated events, estimated depreciation rates are such that the half-life of an
event ranges from about 2 to 13 months. That is, half of the temporary shock associated with an
event has disappeared by this time.

Widowing is of particular interest, as widows experience an unusually large reduction in SWB,
all of which appears to be temporary. Individuals with life insurance experience roughly 80% of
the temporary drop in SWB suffered by those without insurance, though the latter are estimated
to recover slightly more quickly from their (larger) fall. This is depicted, both parametrically and

Table 2 compares results from equation 5 and our dynamic method. The first three columns
show estimates (identical to Table 1) for βT, βP, and δ, respectively. The fourth, fifth, and sixth
columns give the cumulative temporary, permanent, and total effects, whose construction was
described previously. The mortality rate d is projected using Social Security actuarial tables and
the age-sex composition of our HRS sample. It is 0.057, while the interest rate stipulated is 0.05.
The “Lost Area” columns, 4, 5, and 6 (so-called because they show the “area under the curve”
associated with the hedonic response to an event), condense the information provided in the baseline
specification, giving measures of cumulative SWB consequences. A high depreciation rate renders
the cumulative temporary effect of cancer relatively small in magnitude, while magnifying the
permanent effect by comparison. Strokes have a roughly similar cumulative effect compared to
widowing, while heart attacks and cancer are substantially less damaging.
We also implement equation 5, the linear regression described in Section 2.1. The final column
displays β1 from that regression. These results are generally signed consistently with the Total
Lost Area quantities, but relative magnitudes differ. Recall that 1 is an indicator that toggles on

17

permanently after an event. β1 registers larger magnitude effects for widowing than for most health
events, with the most negative result coming from nursing home entry at −5.9.
Table 3 presents results that utilize data on subjective life expectancy for the same life events.
This is an example of the flexibility of our approach, which facilitates any decomposition of SWB
effects permitted by the data. The first four columns provide the usual parameter estimates plus
η, the effect of a one-year increase in subjective life expectancy on the temporary hedonic effect.
The final three columns give estimates from the previous specification for comparison. In all cases
where we find a statistically significant result, the effect of η is as expected: an event that increases
life expectancy will increase SWB through this channel. The magnitude of these life expectancy
effects is small, however, and the available HRS variables pertaining to life expectancy are crude.
Respondents are asked for their subjective probability of living to a given age, which gives only
limited information about the distribution of longevity expectations.
Table 4 gives estimates of βP , βT , and δ for events that are dated relatively imprecisely: either
to the year or to the wave. In the former case, these are retrospective data from the Psychosocial
Leave-Behind survey. Because there are often long gaps between event occurrence and recollection,
the estimates produced from this data are somewhat less reliable, which is reflected in the occasional
inability of the NLS procedure to identify a δ significantly above zero. In these cases, the data does
not permit the separation of temporary and permanent SWB effects, and consequently βT and βP
values should likely be disregarded.

Discussion and Conclusion

In Section 3.2, conditions were described that may produce discrepancies in the SWB ranking (i.e.,
the ordering by magnitude of the “Total” cumulative effect) based on our baseline specification,
and on a regression that does not incorporate SWB mean reversion. Table 2 suggests some concrete
examples. Interestingly, within the three major health events we consider (heart attacks, strokes,
and cancer), our cumulative SWB ranking mirrors the ranking generated by equation 5. However,
some discrepancies exist for other events: for example, according to the conventional approach, the
SWB effect of unemployment is larger than that of cancer or heart attacks. With our approach,
the total cumulative effect of unemployment is smaller.

18

The time path of happiness can be informative in other ways. Applied to parental death, the
pooled specification yields negligible effects. Our decomposition provides some insight into what
is likely driving this result: in the pooled regression, large but very fleeting negative temporary
effects are obscured by slightly positive permanent effects. Without such a decomposition, it would
appear that parental death has negligible or even positive consequences for respondent happiness a result that does not appear particularly plausible. Similarly, the large, but quite fleeting, negative
temporary effect of divorce is concealed (in a pooled regression) by the positive permanent effect.
Our decomposition shows that divorce is not unambiguously positive for SWB.
This illustrates that the temporary/permanent decomposition of SWB data is sometimes a firstorder concern. The overall utility consequence of an event, good, or experience is quite sensitive to
this decomposition, since temporary effects are generally fairly quick to decay. Without arbitrarilyfrequent and indefinitely-extended panels of SWB measurements, a regression specification that
is not sensitive to hedonic dynamics will typically generate errors, particularly when comparing
events of dissimilar dynamic profiles. If one of the aims of happiness economics is to inform public
policy about relative valuations of events and non-market goods, insensitivity to dynamic effects
will compromise that project.
The approach presented here will be useful in a variety of ways. Work that aims at pricing nonmarket goods, many of which take on characteristics of durable goods and produce a changing flow
of utility, will benefit from the explicit treatment of dynamic effects. When data is infrequentlycollected, retrospective, or otherwise limited, our approach will facilitate the extraction of usable
information. Since SWB variables have only recently been added to some datasets, the ability to
handle retrospective data is likely to be useful.
