    "abstract": "\n\nWe experimentally evaluate group-based financial education, savings account access, or both for members of Ugandan youth groups. We measure both short- and long-run impacts with one- and five- year endline household surveys. Education, but not account access, increases measured financial knowledge and trust at one-year. At five-years, knowledge effects essentially disappear, and trust effects weaken. However, savings and income increase for each treatment at both endlines, which is noteworthy given the interventions\u2019 low cost and the long time horizon of our second endline. Exploring potential mechanisms, we find evidence consistent with multiple pathways to behavior change and outcome improvement.\n\n",

Evidence from Ugandan Youth Clubs\u201d reported on the same experiment but with only one-year results and a different focus, and (2) NBER Working Paper No. 28011, \u201cDoes Lasting Behavior Change Require Knowledge Change? Evidence From Savings Interventions for Young Adults\u201d reported on the five-year results but with more of a focus on the role of knowledge change.
