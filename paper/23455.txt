Asset Pricing in the Quest for the New El Dorado
Daniel Andrei and Bruce I. Carlin
NBER Working Paper No. 23455
May 2017
JEL No. G12,L13
ABSTRACT
Creative destruction not only involves bringing new technology to market, it imposes higher risk
on the future of existing assets. We characterize the asset pricing implications of creative
destruction when investors compete for market share. Compared to the social optimum, the quest
for oligopoly rents leads to over-investment in uncertain projects, spikes in asset prices and risk
premia, and an aftermath in which prices fall steeply as uncertainty resolves. These pricing
patterns resemble a bubble ex post, but arise solely from competitive behavior and do not require
information asymmetry, behavioral biases, or financial frictions. Our analysis yields novel
empirical predictions and we discuss how financial innovation might be used to predict bubbles
ex ante.

“There is much more to a bubble than a mere security price increase.
There is innovation, displacement of existing firms, creation of new ones,
and more generally a paradigm shift as entrepreneurs and investors rush
toward a new Eldorado.”

Introduction

According to Schumpeter (1934), invention and entrepreneurship are two distinct
activities. And it is the entrepreneur who is tasked with bringing advancements to
market. Naturally, the incentive to innovate depends on the rents available for extraction and creative destruction is often associated with wealth transfer. Much of the
existing literature that has followed has further developed and tested Schumpeter’s
hypotheses, with a focus on competitive industry analysis (e.g., Williamson, 1965;
Reinganum, 1983; Aghion, Bloom, Blundell, Griffith, and Howitt, 2005)1 and quantifying whether creative destruction indeed increases social welfare (e.g., Witt, 1996;
Aghion, Akcigit, Bergeaud, Blundell, and Hémous, 2015; Komlos, 2014).2
Yet, there is an unsung hero in this story, the financier, who has been largely neglected, but plays an important role. The comparative advantage of the financier is to
assess risk and allocate scarce resources efficiently in the market. Within Schumpeter’s
framework, the financier’s responsibility would be to govern how much entrepreneurship comes to market, based on the risk of new projects and the uncertainty that
creative destruction imposes on existing assets. This activity drives the evolution of
asset prices in the market and in turn the ability to bear risk. This is the focus of
this paper.
Creative destruction and entrepreneurship are different from simply adding new
assets to a well-diversified portfolio because innovation potentially makes the future of
existing assets more risky (Kung and Schmid, 2015) and may endogenously change the
variance-covariance matrix. Gârleanu, Kogan, and Panageas (2012) refer to this as
“displacement risk” and show that it can rationalize both the existence of the growthvalue factor in returns, as well as the equity premium. Because creative destruction
may divert scarce resources away from existing assets or alter their growth options and

capabilities, it is not surprising that there appears to be a risk premium associated
with it (Grammig and Jank, 2015).
Moreover, creative destruction involves learning by doing and has an observer
effect, which is quite different than what has been explored to date in the asset
pricing literature. When capital gets allocated to a new opportunity, learning occurs
via experimentation (e.g., Arrow, 1962; Grossman, Kihlstrom, and Mirman, 1977;
Aghion, Bolton, Harris, and Jullien, 1991; Rob, 1991), which affects expectations
about existing assets in the rest of the market. This “perturbs” the system of asset
prices and expectations, so learning has feedback effects to the rest of the market
and is costly through its effect on risk. Such learning by doing contrasts with the
standard learning processes that are typically analyzed, whereby agents update their
beliefs from a time-series of signals that they receive for free.3
In this paper, we characterize the equilibria and asset pricing implications that
arise with creative destruction. We study an exchange economy in which investment
in creative destruction has two effects on the consumption stream: it changes the
growth rate of consumption—hopefully for the better—and it amplifies the magnitude of the diffusion. The former captures the fact that new technologies have uncertain benefits for economic growth; the latter captures the fact that new technologies
have unintended consequences and make the future of existing assets more uncertain.
We contrast a socially optimal benchmark with a setting in which non-cooperative
investors compete for a share of the rents created by the new technology. We model
the strategic interaction as an aggregative game (i.e., Cournot competition) in which
competitors make simultaneous choices about how much to experiment with the new
technology and the payoffs are a function of each investor’s claim to an endogenous
dividend stream.4
We find that when competitors fight for market share, this leads to overinvestment
compared to what is socially optimal, and that aggregate experimentation grows with
the number of investors. In turn, with socially excessive experimentation, both the
volatility of future consumption and the uncertainty about the expected growth rate
of the economy are magnified. In equilibrium, this results in a spike in the price3

The incomplete information literature starts with Williams (1977), Detemple (1986), Dothan
and Feldman (1986), and Gennotte (1986). A comprehensive survey is provided in Ziegler (2003).

In the aggregative game, the payoff to each player is a function of the sum of their own choice
and that of all competitors. This not only affects each player’s consumption share, but affects the
nature of the consumption stream they get to enjoy.

dividend ratio because of Jensen’s inequality effects—loosely speaking, the asset has
a convex, option-like payoff and becomes more valuable with over-experimentation.
As uncertainty resolves over time, there is an aftermath in which prices reverse and
return to normal. Higher experimentation leads to faster learning and resolution of
uncertainty, which causes prices to fall quickly after the run up.
As such, competition among rent-seeking agents in markets for new technologies
generates price patterns that resemble a “bubble”. However, the price paths generated by creative destruction can be identified as a bubble only ex post. Ex ante,
agents do not expect prices to fall, but learning by doing decreases uncertainty over
time and stock prices adjust endogenously. Bayesian uncertainty (i.e., posterior variance) decays faster with over-experimentation, which accelerates the eventual decline
in asset prices. Therefore, our model predicts that markets characterized by fierce
competition for new technologies are not only prone to asset price inflation but also
to steeper subsequent declines through learning by doing and faster resolution of
uncertainty.
For decades, most researchers have defined a bubble to be a setting in which
the price of an asset exceeds its fundamental value. This has spawned an extensive
literature to characterize this distortion and its associated price process. With this
definition in mind, bubbles may arise when investors have heterogeneous beliefs and
traders have the option to resell the asset to more optimistic agents in the future
(Harrison and Kreps, 1978; Morris, 1996; Scheinkman and Xiong, 2003) or when
there are short-sale constraints that prevent pessimists in the market from countering
the demand from optimists (Miller, 1977; Ofek and Richardson, 2003). Bubbles may
also arise when some investors have overconfidence or excessive optimism, and may
grow when arbitrageurs are differentially informed about the presence of the bubble
and face financial constraints (Abreu and Brunnermeier, 2003). Brunnermeier and
Oehmke (2013) provide an excellent review.
More recently, however, Pastor and Veronesi (2009) have shown that the price
patterns associated with what we call bubbles do not require a (possibly irrational)
wedge between fundamentals and prices. In their model, if a new technology becomes
sufficiently promising, its expected cash flows rise, which initially pushes up the stock
price. However, because the risk of the technology gradually shifts from idiosyncratic
to systematic, the discount rate rises, ultimately leading to a drop in the valuation of
the asset. We share their view that irational behavior is not a prerequisite for bubbles.
3

Our model is distinct, however, because over-valuation of the asset is generated by
increased competition and over-investment in new technologies, and risk is systematic
at all times. Moreover, it is the learning by doing feature of our model, coupled with
excessive experimentation, that leads to steep subsequent declines in asset prices as
uncertainty resolves over time.
DeMarzo, Kaniel, and Kremer (2007) also provide an explanation of bubbles that
does not require a wedge between prices and fundamentals. In their model with
multiple agents, a “keep up with the Joneses” concern endogenously arises as no agent
wants to be left behind. This leads to over-investment that is predictably unprofitable,
which they argue is consistent with a bubble. Such over-investment arises in our
paper as well. But the focus of our paper is on the asset pricing implications of
socially excessive experimentation. We show that competition magnifies uncertainty
in the market and leads to over-valuation of asset prices, followed by an aftermath
characterized by gradual resolution of uncertainty and price reversals. It is likely that
a “keep up with the Joneses” concern would magnify the competitive forces in our
model, and thus we see the two papers as complementary.
The pricing patterns that we generate arise from rational competitive behavior, without requiring information asymmetry, behavioral biases (e.g., optimism or
overconfidence), or financial markets frictions. Marrying considerations from the industrial organization literature with those in asset pricing accomplishes this, and
seems natural given the level of competition that typically occurs during technological change. Inded, many bubbles arise when investors race to market during eras
of technological change (e.g., the Tronics boom, 1959-1962; the Biotech bubble of
the 1980’s; the Dotcom era, 1995-2001).5 However, while we provide a rational explanation for the evolution of bubbles, we do not take the position that irrational
exuberance does not contribute to price fluctuations. Quite the opposite. It would
be easy to envision how irrationality might exacerbate the boom-bust price patterns
that we demonstrate.
Our model generates a unique prediction on how financial innovation might be
used to detect bubbles. As Greenwood et al. (2017) document, sharp price increases
predict a substantially heightened probability of an ensuing crash and attributes of the
price run-up such as price volatility and asset turnover can help forecast the eventual
aftermath. In our model, high price-dividend ratios may arise not only as a result of
5

See Section 1 of Xiong (2013) for a thorough review of historical bubbles.

4

agents’ expectations about future growth, but also as a result of uncertainty. But, it
is not possible to infer from the price-dividend ratio alone both the expected growth
and the degree of uncertainty. However, in our analysis expected growth enters in the
price-dividend valuation as a linear function of the maturity of the dividend stream,
while parameter uncertainty enters as a quadratic function. This suggests that if a
market for dividend strips were to exist, as proposed by Brennan (1998b), bubbles
might be detectable by plotting log values for a horizon of dividends. As we show
in the paper, without competitive behavior, this plot is almost linear, whereas with
competition and over-experimentation, it is non-linear.
Last, a testable prediction of our model is that, in markets characterized by intense
creative destruction or by heightened uncertainty about the expected growth of new
technologies, investors demand a higher premium per quantity of risk. Consistent
with this prediction, recent empirical research by Grammig and Jank (2015) show
that indeed invention activity creates risk which has to be compensated, and that it
can account for the size and value premia observed in financial markets.
The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 poses the model, characterizes learning and optimal experimentation, and contrasts the equilibrium behavior of
competitive agents to what is socially optimal. Section 3 characterizes the asset pricing implications of creative destruction. Section 4 returns to a one agent setting in
which the investor maximizes social welfare and characterizes an extension in which
the agent may exercise an option to expand or abandon experimentation at every
instant in time. Section 5 concludes. All proofs are relegated to the Appendix.

Experimentation and Learning

Consider an exchange economy defined over a continuous-time finite horizon [0, T ].
In the status quo, the aggregate output is
dδtS
= f¯dt + σdWt ,
δtS

(1)

where the parameters f¯ and σ are known. The economy is populated by an active
investor who consumes a share θ of the output and a passive investor who consumes
fraction 1 − θ. For now, we fix θ exogenously so that the active investor cannot
modify her consumption share. Later, we endogenize θ, which will reflect rent seeking
5

behavior and strategic considerations among competitive active investors.
At time t = 0, the active investor has the choice to re-allocate existing capital x0 ≥ 0 to an experimental asset in the market (e.g., a new technology). This new
technology is sufficiently important to affect the entire economy. It affects the aggregate consumption stream in two ways. First, the new asset has an unknown effect
on the drift, which becomes (f¯ + βx0 ). The parameter β is unknown and captures
both the adverse effect that creative destruction imposes on other assets and a possible benefit in higher future consumption. Thus, innovation can both fuel economic
growth (Aghion and Howitt, 1992; Romer, 1990) and be destructive (e.g., Acemoglu
and Restrepo, 2017), and β is similar to a Schumpeter “creativity ratio” as defined
in Komlos (2014). We assume that the active investor has initial beliefs such that
β ∼ N (βb0 , ν0 ),

(2)

where βb0 > 0, so that the active investor starts with an initial prior that investing in
the experimental asset is a good idea.
Second, investment in the experimental asset amplifies the magnitude of the diffusion term to (1 + kx0 )σ, which captures the increased economic risk that creative
destruction introduces into the economy (Kung and Schmid, 2015). Taken together,
for any x0 , the dynamics for the aggregate output stream in the new economy is
dδt
= (f¯ + βx0 )dt + (1 + kx0 )σdWt .

Johnson (2007) provides a discrete-time microfoundation in a production economy, which is

that experimentation affects the uncertainty regarding the interaction between the new technology

the agents’ expected utility is higher under complete information than under incomplete information.7 Furthermore, this is consistent with empirical evidence8 , and is
frequently used in analyses like these (e.g., Pastor and Veronesi, 2009).
Only the active investor can choose x0 . At t = 0, the active investor commits to an
experimentation level x0 that remains constant from time 0 to T . As such, the active
investor chooses how far to open Pandora’s box at t = 0 and then both investors live
with the consequences.9 Because θ is fixed and investors are otherwise identical, the
choice of the active investor is the socially optimal choice (it simultaneously maximizes
the lifetime utility of both investors—see Proposition 2).
If the active investor chooses x0 = 0, then the economy remains in the status quo.
Once the active investor chooses x0 > 0, both investors observe the total output δt
and learn over time how the new asset impacts future expected growth. But the
experiment comes at a cost: it disturbs the process by increasing the magnitude of
the diffusion. This implies that there is an observer effect, which is distinct from
what is typically modeled in the asset pricing literature with incomplete information.
Usually, agents update their beliefs by observing signals about the drift of the dividend
process for free. Instead, in our case learning occurs by doing, as in Arrow (1962),
Grossman et al. (1977), and Rob (1991). However, unlike these papers, the cost of
experimentation is the added disturbance introduced into the diffusion term through
the parameter k > 0 and the added uncertainty about the true expected growth of
the experimental asset.
Both investors observe the aggregate output stream δt , whose changes are informative about the unknown parameter β. Since the choice of x0 is common knowledge,
both investors form expectations under the same probability measure.
Proposition 1 (Learning) From investors’ viewpoint, this partially observed econ7

More precisely, for any time-additive utility function which is increasing and concave in current
consumption, better information will increase expected utility whenever the second derivative of the
utility with respect to the natural logarithm of consumption is negative. In the case of power utility,
this condition is satisfied when γ > 1. See Chapter 2 in Ziegler (2003) for a discussion.

Friend and Blume (1975) estimate an average coefficient of relative risk aversion well in excess
of one and perhaps in excess of two. Dreze (1981) finds even higher values using an analysis of
deductibles in insurance contracts. See also Mehra and Prescott (1985, p. 154).

The posterior variance starts at ν0 but then decays to zero as t goes to infinity. One
benefit of experimentation is that investors can learn about the new technology and
lower the future Bayesian uncertainty. Moreover, uncertainty decreases faster when x0
is high. However, when k > 0, experimentation also has a negative effect on learning
because it disturbs the economy. In fact, consider the limit of the speed of learning
(the term multiplying time t in the denominator of (8)) as x0 → ∞:

For any k > 0, the speed of learning cannot go above (9) in any finite time. Because
experimentation disturbs the economy, it indeed applies a brake to learning.

2.1

Socially Optimal Experimentation

The active investor’s problem is to choose a level of experimentation that balances
between information gains coupled with the chance of a good experiment and higher
disturbance to future consumption coupled with the chance of a bad experiment. This
tradeoff affects the expected value of future dividends (i.e., E0 [δt ]) and the future
volatility of dividends (i.e., Var0 [ln δt ]), which we derive in Appendix A.1.3. There,
we show that both E0 [δt ] and Var0 [ln δt ], for any t > 0, unambiguously increase with
experimentation, consistent with the idea that creative destruction increases expected
growth but also makes the future more uncertain.
The above tradeoff affects the active investor’s lifetime expected utility of consumption at time t, which is defined as

where F (βbt , νt , t) is the price-dividend ratio in this economy (to be defined and fully
characterized in Proposition 5). We further show that the value function unambiguously increases with E0 [δt ] and unambiguously decreases with Var0 [ln δt ], for any t > 0.
This tradeoff implies a socially optimal level of experimentation.
Proposition 2 (Socially Optimal Experimentation) At t = 0, the active investor chooses an optimal level of experimentation that maximizes social welfare. This
level is

discounted cash-flows).10
10

These positive quantities, defined in Appendix A.1.5, are omitted here for ease of exposition.

9

The optimal level of experimentation in (12) resembles a mean-variance portfolio.
The expression (12) is implicit in x∗0 , however, because the duration and convexity of the cash flows are functions of x∗0 . Experimentation has more impact when the
duration of cash-flows is higher (both in terms of higher growth and higher future consumption volatility) because the active investor’s choice has a longer-lasting impact
on the economy. When the margin between the expected benefit of experimentation
and the penalty from disturbing the economy is higher, the active investor’s incentive to experiment increases further with the duration of cash flows. On the other
hand, uncertainty lowers the active investor’s incentive to experiment. This effect is
stronger when the convexity of future cash flows is high.
Going forward, we assume that the socially optimal level of experimentation x∗S
is strictly positive, i.e., the condition βb0 − γkσ 2 > 0 is satisfied.

2.2

Experimentation with Rent Seeking Behavior

Schumpeterian innovation is typically associated with a wealth transfer from the
owners of existing assets to people who innovate, and arises most commonly when
(potential) monopoly rents are high. Investors who engage in creative destruction
often tradeoff between the wealth gains they enjoy from new knowledge and the
losses they endure because the existing assets they own will be rendered obsolete.
This mirrors Schumpeter’s idea that creative destruction, “incessantly revolutionizes
the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly
creating a new one” (Schumpeter, 1942, p. 83).11 In what follows, we analyze the
amount of entrepreneurship that arises based on these considerations.
Suppose that N ≥ 1 active investors compete for market share and simultaneously
choose experimentation levels xi ≥ 0, for i ∈ {1, ..., N } at t = 0 to maximize (4).
Each active investor i’s consumption share depends not only on her experimentation
decision but also on the aggregate level of experimentation in the economy

11

See also Aghion and Howitt (1992), where this tradeoff is made explicit by showing that more
future research discourages current research by threatening to make it obsolete.

10

By construction, the fraction of the dividend stream claimed by agent i is increasing in wxi , which is meant to capture the increase in the share of aggregate wealth
that agent i can claim (monopoly rents) from the new technology.12 Going forward,
we assume that
w>

2(βb0 − kσ 2 )
> 0,
k2σ2

(14)

so that this incentive is sufficiently large. Indeed, we are interested in the eras with
technology booms, in which investors do in fact race to the “new El Dorado.” However, the wealth share is also decreasing in the product xi x̃C , which captures how
much wealth is lost to competition and also because agent i’s existing assets are
cannibalized or rendered obsolete (Reinganum, 1983; Aghion and Howitt, 1992). As
such, this is an aggregative game that resembles Cournot competition: the market
share for each investor is growing in their own experimentation, but is decreasing in
the sum.
Based on this, the dynamics of consumption are driven by the aggregate level of
experimentation:
dδt
ct .
= (f¯ + βbt x̃C )dt + σ(1 + kx̃C )dW

(15)

Each agent experiments less when their competitors experiment and disturb the economy, which increases the output volatility that everyone faces. Competition also
lowers the share of consumption that each agent earns by experimenting. Last, experimentation by competitors increases the overall uncertainty in the economy. Given
this, each agent chooses an optimal level of experimentation, taking into account the
simultaneous choices of the other players.
Proposition 3 (Cournot Experimentation) There exists a unique Nash equilibrium in which the aggregate level of experimentation under competition among N

Innovation and top income inequality in the US and other developed countries tend to follow a
parallel evolution. According to Aghion et al. (2015), 11 out of the 50 wealthiest individuals across
US states in 2015 “are listed as inventors in a US patent and many more manage or own firms that

(16)

where each active agent experiments at a symmetric level x∗i = x̃∗C /N . The quantity x̃∗C
is strictly increasing in N and x̃∗C > x∗S ∀N .
Proposition 3 also shows that rent seeking increases experimentation in the economy, and that competition exacerbates this. As competition intensifies, the aggregate
level of experimentation moves further away from the socially optimal level x∗S , reaching a maximum when N → ∞.
Such creative destruction and competition for rents causes the lifetime utility from
the future consumption stream to deteriorate and lowers the welfare for the passive

This is because rent seeking by active investors not only reduces the passive investors’
consumption share, it exposes them to too much risk and lowers the expected utility
which they derive from the future consumption stream. Further, higher competition
exacerbates this because experimentation rises and hurts residual claimants in the
economy.
We illustrate the effect of rent seeking behavior and creative destruction on the
aggregate level of experimentation in Figure 1. The parameters that we choose for
this numerical example (provided in the caption of the Figure) are economically plausible and will be the same when we explore the implications for asset prices. The plot
depicts three equilibria (Monopoly, Duopoly, and Perfect Competition). These equilibria are the fixed-point solutions of Eq. (16) for three different values of N . We add
the socially optimal level of experimentation (point S) for comparison. Confirming
the results of Proposition 3, there is higher experimentation as competition rises in
the market.

The equilibrium risk-free rate increases with the expected growth rate of consumption and decreases with the volatility of aggregate consumption. The level of
experimentation amplifies both of these well-known asset pricing effects. Furthermore, experimentation increases the market price of risk. This arises because the

(24)

A key result of Proposition 5 is that the equilibrium price-dividend ratio increases
with the uncertainty about β. This effect arises because, as uncertainty about the
true expected growth of the new technology increases, the expected value of future
income streams rises. To see this, suppose that β were known. Then, an application
of Leibniz’ integral rule confirms that the price-dividend ratio is convex in β:

Since β is a random variable, Jensen’s inequality implies that that the price-dividend
ratio under incomplete information must be greater than the one under complete
information in the presence of uncertainty about growth rates (and not about levels).13
More important, in our setup experimentation amplifies this over-valuation effect
in two ways. First, higher experimentation brings more uncertainty to the economy.
Second, experimentation amplifies the convexity of the price-dividend ratio (as shown
in Eq. 25), which causes over-valuation of the risky asset.

Experimentation has two effects on the volatility of stock returns. First, it increases volatility by disturbing the economy and amplifying macroeconomic fluctuations. Second, experimentation decreases the volatility of stock returns as long as
there is uncertainty about the expected growth of the new technology. This arises
from investors’ learning and can be understood as follows. Consider a positive output surprise. Through learning, this generates a higher expected output growth. The
stock price increases because it pays off more consumption into the future. However,
the hedging properties of the stock deteriorate, because it generates high consumption
when needed less. This second effect dominates when investors are more risk averse
than log-utility, lowering the volatility of asset returns.
The risk premium admits a similar interpretation. It increases due to the disturbance effect of experimentation, but decreases due to the uncertainty about the new
technology.
Figure 2 provides an example that illustrates the effect of experimentation on the
price-dividend ratio, the risk premium, and the volatility of stock returns. Panel (a)
shows that the price-dividend ratio reaches a minimum at the socially optimal level
of experimentation of Proposition 2 (the dot labeled S on the graph). To understand
why this is the case, re-write Eq. (11) under the following form:
F (βb0 , ν0 , 0) = (1 − γ)(θδ0 )γ−1 Ja (δ0 , βb0 , ν0 , 0),

(26)

This shows that the price-dividend ratio is directly related to the value function of the
active investor, with a negative sign when the coefficient of risk aversion is higher than
one. Because the active investor chooses an experimentation level that maximizes the
value function, it follows that the equilibrium price-dividend ratio reaches a minimum
when experimentation is socially optimal.
The direct implication of this inverse relationship is that any level of experimentation that deviates from the optimum always increases the price-dividend ratio.
Panel (a) shows that the price-dividend ratio increases under monopoly (Proposition 3, N = 1, dot labeled M), further increases under duopoly (N = 2, dot labeled
D), and reaches a maximum under perfect competition (N → ∞, dot labeled PC).
Panels (b) and (c) of Figure 2 show that the risk premium and the volatility are
hump-shaped in experimentation. The initial increase is driven by the first terms
in (23)-(24), whereas the subsequent decrease is driven by the second, uncertainty

terms.
Based on our analysis, there appears to be a higher risk premium associated with
creative destruction, but this admittedly does depend on the parameters specified in
the model. For most reasonable specifications, however, this will indeed be the case.
To explore this further, we define the normalized risk premium (i.e., risk premium
per unit of variance) in the economy as14

This expression conveniently isolates in the denominator the impact of experimentation x0 and uncertainty νt . Experimentation leads to an increase in the equilibrium
normalized risk premium above the value γ that would prevail in the market without
experimentation. Thus, comparing a market characterized by innovation and creative
destruction with a market without creative destruction yields a higher risk premium
per unit of risk for the former. This is consistent with the fact that agents with
risk-aversion γ > 1 require a risk premium when more uncertainty is present in the
economy (see Footnote 7). Furthermore, Eq. (27) suggests a testable prediction of

The normalized risk premium, divided by the risk aversion, represents the tangency portfolio in
a portfolio choice problem with random investment opportunities (Merton, 1973; Brennan, 1998a).

our model, in that sectors characterized by stronger invention activity are riskier.15
Experimentation has further implications for the term structure of risk. To see
this, in Corollary 5.1 we decompose the asset into dividend strips (i.e., assets that
pay the aggregate consumption only at time s > t).
Corollary 5.1 For any experimentation level x0 , the price of a dividend strip with
maturity s > t is

Experimentation has two effects on the term structure of risk premia and volatilities. First, by increasing the disturbance associated with the introduction of new
technologies, experimentation increases the risk premia and volatilities at all maturities. This can be seen from the first terms in (29)-(30). Second, experimentation
introduces uncertainty about the expected growth of the new technology. This dampens the risk premia and volatilities (as elaborated above). Corollary 5.1 shows that
the dampening effect positively depends on maturity. The volatility of dividend strips
with longer maturities is lowered through learning, which also induces lower risk premia. As a result, the term structures of risk premia and volatilities become downward
sloping with experimentation.
The effect of experimentation on the term structure of risk is shown in Figure 3.
Without experimentation (solid lines), the term structure of risk premia and volatilities is flat. Then, consistent with Corollary 5.1, experimentation generates downward
sloping term structures. First, by amplifying the volatility of the consumption output, more experimentation produces a level increase in risk premia and volatilities
at all maturities. Second, uncertainty dampens this increase, more so in the far future. Competition among active investors amplifies this steepening effect. The slopes

This prediction has been tested empirically by Grammig and Jank (2015), who show that crosssectional differences across size and book-to-market sorted portfolios can be explained as premia for
bearing creative destruction risk.

economy equals x0 = x∗P C .

3.1

The Aftermath of Experimentation

We now consider the consequences on asset prices in the aftermath of the decision to
experiment. We illustrate how the rent seeking behavior of active investors engaged in
creative destruction amplifies the effect that competition has on stock price valuations
and generates patterns that ex post can be identified as booms and busts.
To this end, we consider an economy with perfect competition (N → ∞) and
assume a relatively high value for the rent seeking parameter, w = 5. The reason
for this choice is twofold. First, it implies an equilibrium price-dividend ratio well
above 30, which is often considered as a warning sign that stock markets are in a bubble (Shiller, 2015). Second, it implies an aggregate consumption share of roughly 5%
for the mass of active investors, who initially start from a share of 0.1%. This large
increase in consumption share highlights the power of rent-seeking behavior for wealth
redistribution and is also in line with widely acknowledged facts about top income

inequality worldwide (e.g., Aghion et al., 2015).
Panel (a) in Figure 4 depicts the price-dividend ratio in this economy as a function
of the aggregate experimentation (solid line). The dot labeled ED (“El Dorado”)
represents the equilibrium price-dividend ratio with perfect competition. In the same
plot, the dashed line depicts the price-dividend ratio when uncertainty about β is
fixed at ν0 = 0. The gap between the two lines provides a measure of the overvaluation due to uncertainty (see Proposition 5 and its discussion). We also show
on the plot the point S, which corresponds to the socially optimal experimentation
level (Proposition 2). Rent seeking behavior and intense competition lead to overexperimentation. In turn, this adds uncertainty to the economy and increases the
the gap between the two lines. This gap grows from being almost negligible at S to
roughly 100% at ED.
It is instructive to compare the dynamics of the price-dividend ratio once the
points ED and S have been reached. To do so, let us assume that the prior βb0 is
exactly equal to the true value of β. That is, we are assuming that agents are initially
19

right—but still uncertain—about the expected growth of the new technology, and thus
we are not imposing any optimistic/pessimistic bias in the future paths of prices. As it
turns out, this assumption is extremely convenient, because it ensures that simulations
of the economy over time will result in an average βbt which is equal to the true
value of β.16 Furthermore, because the remaining state variable which enters in the
valuation of the price-dividend ratio, the uncertainty νt , decreases deterministically
over time, we can directly plot the average price-dividend ratio over time by simply
using Eq. (8) for the dynamics of νt , without resorting to simulations.
Panel (b) in Figure 4 depicts these dynamics. The solid line corresponds to the
average path of the price-dividend ratio starting from ED, whereas the dashed line
shows the average path of the price-dividend ratio starting from S. Because the remaining life of the asset diminishes, we also add to the plot the dotted line, which
isolates the effect of the decrease in uncertainty by holding the remaining asset life
constant at T = 100 years (this adjustment is unnecessary in the S case, where the
decrease in the price-dividend ratio is almost imperceptible). The panel shows that,
after reaching the point ED, asset prices have the tendency to decrease as uncertainty about the new technology resolves. In contrast, after experimentation at the
socially optimal level (point S), the average decrease in asset price due to resolution
of uncertainty is negligible.
As such, competition among rent-seeking agents in markets for new technologies
generates price patterns that resemble a “bubble.” It is important to mention that
the situation depicted in panel (b) can be identified as a bubble only ex post; ex ante,
agents do not expect prices to fall. But, because learning by doing decreases the
uncertainty about β over time, stock prices adjust endogenously. The pace of this adjustment process depends on the rate at which uncertainty about the new technology
is resolved. More specifically, Eq. (8) shows that the posterior variance decays faster
with over-experimentation,17 which accelerates the eventual decline in asset prices.
Our model therefore predicts that markets characterized by fierce competition for new
technologies are not only prone to stronger asset price inflation but also to steeper

Technically, at time t = 0 the filter β is a martingale. This ensures that the average of its future
simulated values one step ahead, βb0+dt , is exactly β. Then apply the same reasoning at time

In Eq. (8), the coefficient multiplying time in the denominator can be interpreted as the speed of
learning. It is a matter of algebra to show that the speed of learning increases with experimentation.

subsequent declines through learning by doing and faster resolution of uncertainty.
Finally, we highlight here the importance of learning for the evolution of bubbles.
The aftermath depicted in Panel (b) of Figure 4 can only take place through learning.
If no uncertainty (and thus learning) about the true expected growth of the new
technology were present, then prices would never fall and we would not observe an
aftermath.

3.2

A Possible Ex Ante Diagnosis of “Bubbles”

Bubble peaks are notoriously hard to identify (Fama, 2014; Greenwood et al., 2017).
In this section, we try to address this issue by proposing a plausible test for bubbles,
that depends on future financial innovation.
In our model, high stock valuations and price-dividend ratios may arise not only
because of agents’ expectations about future growth, but also because of uncertainty
coupled with rent seeking behavior and intensified competition. According to Proposition 5, the price-dividend ratio in this economy depends on both βbt and νt :

(31)

It is therefore not possible to infer both the expected growth and the degree of
uncertainty from the price-dividend ratio alone. However, notice that the expected
growth enters this valuation equation as a linear function of the maturity (s − t),
whereas parameter uncertainty enters as a quadratic function. This suggests that if
a market for dividend strips were established (Brennan, 1998b), defined as claims to
each year’s dividend on an index, this might help detect bubbles ex ante by identifying
when high stock price valuations are primarily driven by uncertainty and competition.
To illustrate this, consider Figure 5, where we use Corollary 5.1 to plot the log
values of dividend strips for the remaining life of the asset. We consider two situations.
The solid line shows the log values of dividend strips when the price-dividend ratio
is at the point ED (“El Dorado”). The dashed line pertains to the socially optimal
experimentation case (point S in Figure 4).
The solid line shows a clear non-linear pattern, which arises from the quadratic
term in Eq. (31). This effect is almost nil with the dashed line, which is indistinguishable from a straight line. If a market for dividend strips were present, a statistical

test could be devised to help reject the null hypothesis of linear dependence on maturity. We emphasize that this test is different than a standard test of the no-bubble
condition (Giglio, Maggiori, and Stroebel, 2016). In our case, prices of strips at all
maturities offer a “term-structure” pattern whose shape becomes non-linear if asset
prices are overvalued due to uncertainty.

Dynamic Experimentation

So far, we have assumed that the decision to experiment is made only once, at t = 0.
In reality, however, innovation is not a one-time decision, but often occurs in waves
(Gort and Klepper, 1982). Now, we return to the socially optimal case of Section 2.1
and consider that the active agent can choose the experimentation level xt at any
time t, in order to maximize her expected lifetime utility. Thus, she can alter the
level of experimentation dynamically and retains the option to expand or abandon
her investment at every instant.18
The active agent’s expected lifetime utility of consumption Ja satisfies the follow18

See also Rob (1991) for a sequential model of entry in which uncertainty gradually resolves over
time. In our case, the decision to alter the experimentation level is made by a single agent.

The solution (34) constitutes an implicit form since the control xt appears on the
right hand side of the equation. Nevertheless, it highlights two main components of
the optimal level of experimentation. The first is a “mean-variance” component which
increases when the active agent expects a higher growth for the new technology βbt
and decreases with the risk aversion coefficient and the disturbance parameter k. The
second is a “hedging” component, which vanishes when there is no uncertainty about
the new technology. This term results from agent’s desire to hedge variations in the
filter βbt but also from agent’s ability to exert control through her experimentation
choice on the evolution of both βbt and νt .

4.1

Asset Prices with Dynamic Experimentation

Proposition 6 shows that in the dynamic case the optimal experimentation level fluctuates as new information becomes available and affects the agent’s expectations.
This has further impact on asset prices in the economy, which we characterize below.

23

Proposition 7 (Asset Prices with Dynamic Experimentation) In an economy with dynamic experimentation, the risk-free rate and the market price of risk are
given by

(38)

Expressions (35)-(38) have a similar structure with the ones in the static case
(Section 3), with two main differences. First, the market price of risk now fluctuates
and increases with the level of experimentation. Second, in (37)-(38), the equity
duration from the static case has been adjusted to account for time variation in
xt . We define this adjusted duration in Appendix A.3.2 . The intuition from the
static case applies here as well: by increasing the volatility of aggregate consumption,
experimentation magnifies both the equity risk premium and the volatility of asset
returns; however, too much experimentation can lower risk premia and volatility
through the learning channel, which dampens asset price fluctuations. Therefore, in
the dynamic case as in the static case, both the risk premium and the volatility will
feature a hump-shaped pattern in experimentation.
We compare the optimal level of experimentation, the risk premium and the
volatility in the static versus the dynamic case in Figure 6, first as a function of
the filter βbt in the upper panels, and then as a function of the uncertainty νt in
the lower panels.19 The static experimentation case is depicted with blue solid lines,
whereas the dynamic experimentation case is depicted with red dashed lines.
When the filter βb0 is sufficiently low, neither the “static” or the “dynamic” agent
decide to experiment, as shown in panel (a). When experimentation is positive,
the “dynamic” experimenter allocates more capital to the new technology than the
“static” experimenter for any level of βbt . This is because the dynamic experimenter

always has the option to stop or decrease later on. In contrast, the static experimenter
is more cautious when fixing an initial experimentation level.
Because of this, the risk premium and the volatility are generally higher with
dynamic experimentation than with static experimentation, as shown in panels (b)
and (c). Indeed, the option to abandon lowers risk for the dynamic experimenter. But,
internalizing this she experiments more, which raises the risk premium and volatility.
In the lower panels of Figure 6, the risk premium and the volatility are plotted
for different values of the uncertainty νt . In the static case, the risk premium and the
volatility decrease with uncertainty. The static experimenter always chooses a lower
level of experimentation if uncertainty is high, which decreases the risk premium and
the volatility. In the dynamic case, however, both the risk premium and the volatility
25

remain more or less constant in νt (eventually, they decrease once the last terms in
(37)-(38) dominate). We can understand this by analyzing two extreme cases. First, if
uncertainty is negligible, then both the static and dynamic agent know the parameter
β and thus their choices over x0 are the same. Second, if uncertainty is unusually
high, both the “static” and “dynamic” agent give up experimenting. Consequently,
only intermediate values of ν0 are beneficial for the “dynamic experimenter”: because
she has the flexibility to stop experimenting later, she experiments more aggressively
initially and thus both the risk premium and the volatility remain high with dynamic
experimentation and for intermediate values of uncertainty.

Conclusion

This paper proposes a financial markets perspective on Schumpeter (1934)’s evolutionary economics ideas, according to which introduction of new technologies disturbs
the flow of economic life and forces existing means of production to lose their position
within the economy. It is then the task of the financier to decide how much of the
new technology the economy should be willing to take.
From the financier’s viewpoint, an optimum exists. This optimum balances the
gains of economic development associated with new productive technologies against
the disturbance imposed on the status quo. The process of reaching such an optimum
involves learning by doing (i.e., experimentation), which has an observer effect and
creates uncertainty in financial markets. Rent-seeking behavior and intensified competition for new markets leads to socially excessive experimentation, inflating asset
prices and generating high risk premia and high volatility. In hindsight, asset prices
exhibit familiar boom and bust patterns observed during technological revolutions.
Rent seeking behavior by active investors has welfare consequences. It reduces the
passive investors’ (those who are not involved in entrepreneurial activity) consumption share, exposes them to too much risk and lowers the expected utility of their
consumption stream. Higher competition exacerbates this because experimentation
rises, which hurts the residual claimants in the economy.
A worthwhile direction for future research would be to link a proxy for experimentation (i.e., x∗t in our model) with dynamic patterns in asset prices. Greenwood
et al. (2017) find that, in conjunction with an sharp price increase, economies characterized by high stock issuance have a heightened probability of a subsequent crash.
26

Our model offers a justification for their finding and a theoretical argument in favor
of using more information in order to identify bubbles.
We have assumed throughout this paper that investors share the same beliefs
about the expected growth of a new technology. In reality, these markets might
very well be characterized by strong divergence of opinion about the promise of new
innovations. It might be an interesting exercise to study the interaction between
competition and difference of beliefs. Our guess is that active agents will decide to
experiment more in order to preempt entry of optimistic competitors, in this way
exacerbating the effect of over-experimentation on asset prices.
Finally, it is important to further explore the implications of dynamic experimentation on asset prices. Because dynamic experimentation provides the agent an
additional option to abandon a new technology at any point in the future, it can have
adverse consequences for the valuation of firms involved in entrepreneurial activity.
Coupled with lack of perfect knowledge, dynamic experimentation might lead the
financier to conclude that a particular new technology is not productive and abandon
it prematurely. This “abandonment risk” has consequences for asset prices.

Experimentation and Learning
Microfoundation

Consider two intermediate goods, a “status-quo” good and an “experimental” good:

δtS


k2 σ2
dδtE
= Γ−
x0 dt + kσdWt .

δtE

(39)
(40)

The parameter Γ, which enters in the expected growth of the experimental good, is an
unknown constant. The expected growth for the experimental good exhibits decreasing
returns to scale: a higher initial level of experimentation x0 decreases its expected growth
by a term proportional to the instantaneous variance of δtE , k 2 σ 2 . Define the consumption
basket in the economy as20
x0
δt = δtS δtE
.
(41)
If x0 = 0, the economy remains in the status-quo and only the good δtS is consumed. When
x0 > 0, the experimental good becomes a new variety in the consumption basket, with a
weight given by x0 /(1 + x0 ). Aplying Itô’s lemma on δt yields:

dδt
= f¯ + βx0 dt + σ(1 + kx0 )dWt ,
δt

(42)

where β ≡ Γ + 12 (2 − k)kσ 2 is an unknown constant. This provides a microfoundation of
Eq. (3) in the text.

A.1.2

Proof of Proposition 1 (Learning)

The proof of Proposition 1 follows from direct application of this standard result in filtering
theory:
Theorem 8 (Liptser and Shiryayev, 1977) Consider an unobservable process ut and
an observable process st with dynamics
dut = [a0 (t, st ) + a1 (t, st )ut ] dt + b1 (t, st )dZtu + b2 (t, st )dZts
dst = [A0 (t, st ) + A1 (t, st )ut ] dt +

B1 (t, st )dZtu

+

B2 (t, st )dZts .

(43)
(44)

All the parameters can be functions of time and of the observable process. Then, the filter
evolves according to (we drop the dependence of coefficients on t and st for notational

In the present setup, the unobservable variable is the constant β. Hence,
a0 = a1 = b1 = b2 = 0.

(50)

Furthermore, the observable process is δt . Applying Itô’s lemma on ln δt yields
1
A0 = f¯ − σ 2 (1 + kx0 )2 ,

A1 = x0 ,

B1 = 0,

B2 = σ(1 + kx0 ).

Direct application of Theorem 8 yields Proposition 1.

We prove the following proposition using the theory of affine processes (Duffie, Filipović,

tedious.

F (βt , νt , t).
Jp (δt , βbt , νt , t) =

(88)

Because the consumption share θ is constant, the choice of the active investor also maximizes
the expected lifetime utility of the passive investor and is therefore socially optimal (in
other words, different values of the parameter θ ∈ [0, 1] will always yield the same amount
of optimal experimentation). The first order condition for the active investor writes

Z

T

y(x̃C , s)ds.

It can be quickly verified that y(x̃C , s) is log-convex in xi . This implies that the pricedividend ratio F (βb0 , ν0 , 0) is log-convex in xi (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004, p. 105). It
then follows that the term B(xi ) in (103) is convex. Thus, ln z(xi ) is strictly convex and
therefore the function z(xi ) admits a unique minimum. This implies that Ji (δt , βbt , νt , t)
admits a unique maximum. 
Starting from (99), write the first order condition for agent i at time t = 0:

After dividing by (1 − γ)f (xi )F (βb0 , ν0 , 0), the first order condition for agent i at time t = 0
becomes:

b
(109)
0 = (w − xi − x̃C ) + β0 − γkσ (1 + kx̃C ) D0 + x̃C (1 − γ)C0 .
The first term on the right hand side is the marginal benefit of experimentation arising from
an increased consumption share. In the case of a monopolist, this term becomes (w − 2xi ).
Therefore, if w > 2x∗S , then we are guaranteed that a monpolist will invest more than
in the socially optimal case. Furthermore, it can be verified from Proposition 2 that the
highest level of socially optimal experimentation is obtained in the log-utility case and equals
22

Although both functions are convex, this does not guarantee that their product is convex.

35

(βb0 − kσ 2 )/(k 2 σ 2 ). Thus, a sufficient condition necessary to obtain more experimentation
in the monopolistic case is Eq. (14) in the text:

Solving for xi in Eq. (109) yields

xi = βb0 − γkσ 2 (1 + kx̃C ) D0 + (w − x̃C ) − x̃C (γ − 1)ν0 C0 ,

This shows that agents’ best response functions are symmetric. Aggregating across agents
and dividing by N yields an equation in the total experimentation in the economy, x̃C :

This is a fixed point problem (D0 and C0 depend on x̃∗C ). The function on the right hand
side is continuous and starts from a strictly positive value at x̃C = 0. The solution is
obtained when this function crosses the 45-degree line. The fixed point is unique, since we
have proven in Proposition 12 that the function Ji (δt , βbt , νt , t) admits a unique maximum
and xi is unique ∀i = 1, ..., N . To prove that x̃∗C is strictly increasing in N , consider two
consecutive cases, N and N + 1:
x̃∗C (N ) =
x̃∗C (N + 1) =

βb0 D0 − γkσ 2 D0 + w

(115)

The two expressions on the right hand side in (114)-(115) are both functions of the experimentation level x. Naming these functions g(x) and and h(x) respectively, it is clear that,
for any given experimentation level x ≥ 0:
g(x) < h(x).

(116)

This inequality is easily verified, since for a given experimentation level x the duration D0
and the convexity C0 are the same in both functions. It then follows that the point at which
the function h(·) crosses the 45-degree line is strictly higher than the point at which the
function g(·) crosses the 45-degree line (see Figure 1). Since the equilibrium is unique, the
quantity x̃∗C is strictly increasing in N . This completes the proof of Proposition 3.

Implications for Asset Prices
Proof of Proposition 4 (Stochastic Discount Factor)

The proof follows standard results in asset pricing (Duffie, 2010). Assuming time-additive
expected utility, we can define a stochastic discount factor from the optimal consumption
plan of any individual as
ξt = e−ρt

u0 (δt )
.
u0 (δ0 )

(117)

Note that in our case agents consume fixed shares of the aggregate output and observe the
economy under the same probability measure. Given the CRRA assumption, the dynamics
of the stochastic discount factor can then be expressed as

discount factor, whereas the market price of risk process is the negative of the diffusion of
the stochastic discount factor. This yields (19) and (20) in Proposition 4.

Recall that the state variables in this economy evolve according to (5)-(7). The equilibrium
price of the risky asset is

Using Proposition 11, we obtain

(120)

which proves that indeed F (βbt , νt , t) is the price-dividend ratio. We then obtain Ft , Fβ , Fν ,
and Fββ , where F (βbt , νt , t) is defined in (81) and κ(x0 , βbt ) is defined in (82):
∂F (βbt , νt , t)

To obtain the risk premium as in (24), multiply the market price of risk, θt = γσ(1 + kx0 )
(Proposition 4, Eq. 20), with the diffusion of stock returns.

Dynamic Experimentation

The dynamics of consumption with experimentation at time t now depend on xt :

Note that now the active agent can choose the experimentation level xt at any time t in
order to maximize her expected lifetime utility. Thus, the active agent’s expected lifetime
utility of consumption Ja satisfies the partial differential equation

and thus the risk-free rate and the market price of risk from (35)-(36) follow. The stock price
at time t is Pt = δt F (βbt , νt , t). The main change in this case with respect to the static case
is that the dynamics of all state variables depend on the optimal level of experimentation
at time t, x∗t . The dynamics of the stock price can be written
