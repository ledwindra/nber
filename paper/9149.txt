The New York School vs. the School of Paris:
Who Really Made the Most Important Art After World War II?
David W. Galenson
NBER Working Paper No. 9149
September 2002
ABSTRACT
American historians of modern art routinely assume that after World War II New York replaced
Paris as the center of the western art world. An analysis of the illustrations in French textbooks shows
that French art scholars disagree: they rate Jean Dubuffet as the most important painter of the era, ahead
of Jackson Pollock, and they consider Yves Klein’s anthropometries of 1960 as the greatest contribution
of a single year, in front of Andy Warhol’s innovations in Pop Art. Yet the French texts also show that
the French artists’ practices and conceptions of art paralleled those of the Americans. Thus while French
and American scholars disagree over the relative importance of their nations’ artists, there is no
disagreement that the most important art of the 1950s was produced by experimental seekers, and that
of the ‘60s by conceptual finders.

The idea that judgments of aesthetic merit can be affected by the nationality of the
observer would not come as a great surprise to even casual followers of international figure
skating competitions. Even more narrowly, that French and American judgments can differ
considerably is witnessed by the relative esteem of film critics from the two countries for Jerry
Lewis movies, or of their wine experts for California vintages. This investigation tests for
national differences between these countries in a very different aesthetic domain, that of modern
painting after World War II. The issue considered here is an intriguing one: is the canon of
modern art significantly different in different countries, or is there an international consensus on
the relative merit of modern artists?
The Triumph of American Painting?
In 1983, an art historian named Serge Guilbaut began his book on the history of Abstract
Expressionism with the declaration that “After the Second World War, the art world witnessed
the birth and development of an American avant-garde, which in the space of a few years
succeeded in shifting the cultural center of the West from Paris to New York.”1
The proposition stated by Guilbaut was hardly a new one. Perhaps its earliest and most
dramatic announcement had been made by the American critic Clement Greenberg. In 1946,
writing in The Nation, Greenberg had confidently and conventionally asserted that
“The School of Paris remains still the creative fountainhead of modern art, and its every move is
decisive for advanced artists everywhere.”2 Just two years later, however, Greenberg had
emphatically changed his mind. In an article in Partisan Review titled “The Decline of Cubism,”
he proclaimed the fall of Paris and the rise of New York:
If artists as great as Picasso, Braque, and Léger have declined so
grievously, it can only be because the general social premises that

4
used to guarantee their functioning have disappeared in Europe.
And when one sees, on the other hand, how much the level of
American art has risen in the last five years, with the emergence of
new talents so full of energy and content as Arshile Gorky,
Jackson Pollock, David Smith - and also when one realizes how
consistently John Marin has maintained a high standard, whatever
the narrowness of his art - then the conclusion forces itself, much
to our own surprise, that the main premises of Western art have at
last migrated to the United States, along with the center of gravity
of industrial production and political power.3
Although Greenberg’s claim initially shocked many people, this position gained currency
over time. In 1956, when William Seitz completed his Princeton dissertation on Abstract
Expressionism, the first large-scale academic study of the new movement, he would conclude
that “It was with a sense of the importance of what was taking place in American art during the
postwar decade that this study of its values was undertaken.” In discussing the issues of
influence and priority, Seitz noted that:
The topic of American influence on European style is a touchy
one, and statements concerning it should not be made without
careful study. On the basis of the present evidence we do know,
however, that the uniting features of the style which can now be
found in England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and even Japan
... were well established here, due to the war situation, two years
earlier [than in France].4
In 1970, Irving Sandler gave his history of Abstract Expressionism the title The Triumph
of American Painting.5 This view of the era had by then become commonplace among American
art scholars, and it has remained their standard and virtually unquestioned judgment to the
present.6
Unlike Greenberg, Seitz, and Sandler, Serge Guilbaut is French. His concurrence with
the belief of the American scholars in the dominance of postwar American art might therefore be
taken to indicate that there is no dispute along national lines over this proposition. This

5
conclusion might be too hasty, however. Guilbaut is an unusual Frenchman, having studied at an
American university, and taught at a Canadian one; perhaps his views are not representative of
French scholars in general. American historian Anna Chave suggests as much:
The reality that the center of the art market moved to New York
after World War II has never been open to question, but the notion
that the New York School artists precipitated that move by proving
themselves the most path-breaking or originative and influential
artists of their time has never had the currency among European
critics that it has with their American counterparts.7
A recent example of the attitude to which Chave refers was given by Bernard Blistène, Deputy
Director and Chief Curator of France’s Musée national d’art moderne, on the occasion of a joint
exhibition of French and American art in 1998:
No one can deny that Paris and New York were the two centers of
art directly after the [second world] war, even if New York has
tried to proclaim itself the sole art capital of that time ... So, the
choice of some key works by Antonin Artaud, Henri Michaux,
Fautrier, Wols - without speaking, of course, of a younger
generation - must now be considered by the American audience in
a discussion of postwar art.8
The preeminence of American art in the decades after World War II is simply assumed
by American art scholars. The comments of Chave and Blistène raise the possibility that this
assumption is not shared by French scholars. Yet Chave’s remark is a casual comment presented
without documentation, while Blistène’s might simply be a politically correct statement by a
highly placed employee of the French government. Do French and American art scholars really
disagree on the relative merits of the New York School and the Ecole de Paris? The interest of
the question is heightened by the universality of the assumption of American preeminence
among American scholars. If an assumption this uncontroversial in the United States is in fact
not accepted in France, it would make a powerful statement about potential national differences

6
in the assessment of modern art.
This study will present systematic quantitative evidence aimed at answering this
question. As in a series of earlier studies that have measured the consensus of art scholars on the
relative importance of particular painters, and paintings, the study will be based on the tabulation
of illustrations in published surveys of art history.9 In order to compare the views of French and
American art scholars, two separate inventories of illustrations of the work of a selected group of
artists will be made, one drawn from books by French scholars, the other using books by
Americans.
The Artists and the Evidence
The goal in choosing the artists to be studied here was to select the most important
painters who lived and worked in the United States and France in the decades after World War
II. The selection of the American artists was based on an earlier study. That study used a survey
of textbook illustrations to rank the 35 leading painters born during 1900-40 who worked in the
United States.10 This study will consider the 15 of those painters who were found to have the
largest number of illustrations; they are listed in Table 1. Eleven were born in the US, while four
were immigrants who spent their adult lives in the US.11
The French painters were selected by using four French textbooks on the history of
modern art published since 1982.12 The first step was to list all artists who had at least one work
illustrated in at least three of these books. The eleven artists on this list who were born in France
between 1900 and 1940 were placed in the sample, as were another five artists on the list who
were born elsewhere but spent most of their careers in France. In addition, the requirement of
being born in 1900 or after was relaxed to include three other distinguished French artists who

7
were born during 1896-99. The resulting sample of 19 artists is listed in Table 2.
While the definition of an American or French artist is necessarily somewhat subjective,
the goal of this study is to consider the most important artists who worked in New York and
Paris during the two generations following World War II. Rather than possibly excluding
important artists on the narrow grounds of national origin, the intent here was to err, if at all, on
the side of inclusiveness, in recognition of the powerful pull of New York and Paris on artists
from many nations during the decades after World War II. Artists are consequently classified
not simply by place of birth, but by where they made their professional contributions.
The evidence for this study was drawn from textbooks, or other illustrated surveys of art
history, including reference works and monographs. The books were divided into two groups:
those written by Americans, and those by French authors.13 Apart from being the product of
American or French authors, the only other requirements for the books were that they had to be
published after 1980, and that they had to cover all of the relevant history of art. Thus specific
artists might or might not have their work reproduced in a given book, according to the judgment
of the author, but the key selection criterion was that no artist in the sample for this study could
be excluded from a book on the basis of the time period, place, or type of art treated by the book.
A total of 23 books by Americans, and 29 books by French authors, were found that
satisfied these criteria.14 The data set for this study was created by listing every reproduction of
every work of art shown in these two sets of books by all of the 34 artists in the sample.

Cross-Cultural Canon Comparisons
The most basic summary measure of scholars’ judgments of the importance of the artists

8
is presented in Tables 3 and 4, which rank the artists by the total number of illustrations of their
work contained in the American and French textbooks, respectively. The two tables show a
striking contrast.
The American ranking of Table 3 is dominated by American artists. Americans hold the
top 7 positions; Jean Dubuffet, tied for 8th, is the only French artist ranked in the top 10. Only
one other French artist is ranked above any of the Americans, as Yves Klein ranks 15th. The
other 17 French artists hold the lowest 17 positions in the ranking. Four of these fail to have a
single illustration in the American textbooks.
In contrast, a French artist holds the top position in the French ranking of Table 4, as
Dubuffet leads Jackson Pollock by a narrow margin, and Robert Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol,
and Jasper Johns by a wider one. Klein ranks 6th, and Pierre Soulages 7th, giving French artists 3
of the highest 7 positions. French artists furthermore hold 10 of the top 20 positions. French
artists do rank in 5 of the lowest 7 positions, but the American Philip Guston holds the very
lowest ranking.
French artists thus fare dramatically better in the judgments of French scholars than in
those of Americans. In view of this, it is not surprising that French scholars also hold the
individual works of French artists in higher esteem than do their American counterparts. For the
same artists, Tables 5 and 6 rank individual works according to the total number of illustrations
of them that appear in the American and French books, respectively.
The American ranking of Table 5 is dominated by American paintings. No French
painting is ranked among the top 19, and only 3 French paintings are ranked in the highest 29.
In this ranking, each of 5 Americans has as many paintings listed as do all the French artists

9
combined, and Jasper Johns by himself has more paintings than do all the French artists.
The French ranking of Table 6 yields very different results. Yves Klein’s Monochrome
(IKB3) ties Barnett Newman’s Adam for the third position. And another painting by Klein is
joined by works by Arman, Dubuffet, Fautrier, Hantaï, and Raysse in a 13-way tie for the fifth
position, so that no less than 7 works by French artists rank among the total of 17 listed in the
table. The two ranked paintings by Klein give him as many works in Table 6 as any artist in the
sample, and his total is equaled only by two Americans, Johns and Rauschenberg.
One other interesting measure of the importance of artists’ contributions is the number of
illustrations that appear in the textbooks that represent works done by an artist in a single year.
This measure can capture the significance of important and sudden innovations that are not
embodied in a single painting, but instead appear in a group of works, perhaps created for a
single exhibition.15 Using this measure, Tables 7 and 8 rank the most productive single years of
the artists in the sample again as judged by the American and French texts, respectively.
Americans again dominate the ranking of Table 7. Andy Warhol is ranked first, for his
early contributions to Pop Art in 1962. Americans hold the top 7 positions in the table, and 12 of
the top 13. Of the total of 29 individual years ranked, only 3 represent French artists.
The French ranking of Table 8 presents a very different assessment. The single most
important year, by a wide margin, is judged to be Yves Klein’s work of 1960. A second French
entry in the top 10 positions is for Martial Raysse’s work of 1963, which ties for fifth place. In
total, French scholars judge that 11 of the most important 25 individual years of artistic
contributions by sample members are attributable to French artists.
Age and Achievement: Generational Differences

10
Table 8 includes intriguing evidence on artists’ ages. If we examine the French entries,
this tabulation of important years represents a very wide range of ages. Thus Martial Raysse’s
entry in the table is for work he did at just 27, whereas one of Jean Dubuffet’s 3 entries is for
work he did at the advanced age of 83. The difference of 56 years is obviously dramatic, but a
comparison of just two entries might have no substantive significance. The possibility that it
might not be due to chance, however, is suggested by a further comparison. The 11 French
entries in Table 8 are associated with 7 different artists. Four of these artists - Dubuffet, Fautrier,
Soulages, and de Staël - were born before 1920. Their mean age at the time of their entries in
Table 8 was 46. The other three artists - Arman, Klein, and Raysse - were born after 1920.
Their mean age at the time of their entries in Table 8 was just 31.
This difference for the French artists is particularly suggestive because of its parallel to
the results of an earlier study of the leading American artists of this period. That study found
that there was a marked difference in the timing of the careers of the major American painters
born before and after 1920, as the artists born prior to 1920 tended to produce their most
important work substantially later in their careers than was the case for their successors.16
The earlier study was based on the analysis of textbooks published in English.
Interestingly, the evidence of the French textbooks surveyed for the present study both confirms
the earlier results for the American artists and extends them to the French artists. Thus Table 9
shows the ages of artists in the year (or years, in case of ties) from which the French books
reproduced the largest number of their works. The table is restricted to artists who had at least
one year with a minimum of 3 illustrations. The median age of the American artists born before
1920 in their best years was 47.5, well above the median age of 32 for the Americans born after

11
1920. Similarly, the median age of the earlier French artists in their best years, of 44 years, was
well above the median age of 33 for their successors.
The earlier study found that the later generation of Americans not only made their major
contributions at younger ages than did their predecessors, but also that they made them more
suddenly, within shorter periods of time. The French textbooks provide evidence that this
relationship also holds for the French artists. Thus whereas Table 5 showed that French scholars
considered Dubuffet’s overall contribution to be greater than that of any other French artist in the
sample, Table 8 showed that the same evidence revealed that four other French artists ranked
ahead of Dubuffet in the importance of individual years of their careers. Three of these fourincluding Klein, who ranked first in Table 8 - were born after 1920. Table 10 provides
additional evidence for all the French artists, presenting the share of each artist’s total
illustrations in the French texts accounted for by his single best year. The mean of this value for
the 7 artists of the younger generation, of 48%, is double the mean of 24% for the older
generation. The lowest value in the sample occurs for Dubuffet, for whom no more than 10% of
his total illustrations are of works done in a single year, while the highest values occur for Klein
and Raysse, for whom more than 70% of their total illustrations represent work done in just one
year.
Experimental and Conceptual Innovators
The differing career patterns of the American artists appeared to have been a result of a
difference in the way they produced their major contributions. Pollock, de Kooning, and the
other Abstract Expressionists innovated experimentally, using a process of trial and error. Their
innovations took long periods to develop, and emerged gradually over time. In contrast Johns,

12
Warhol, and their contemporaries innovated conceptually, by incorporating new ideas into their
work. Their innovations emerged suddenly, usually early in their artistic careers.17
The same explanation appears to account for the differing career patterns of the French
artists. Interestingly, the same timing emerges for the leading French artists, as the major artists
born before 1920 generally worked experimentally, while the major artists born after that date
innovated conceptually.
Jean Dubuffet emerges from this study as the most important French artist of the birth
cohorts considered: as seen in Tables 3 and 4, the American art scholars place him clearly above
the other French artists, and the French scholars also place him above all the Americans of his
time. American respect for Dubuffet’s work is not a recent phenomenon: in 1946 Clement
Greenberg stated his opinion that “Dubuffet seems the most original painter to have come out of
the School of Paris since Miró,” and in 1968 William Rubin of New York’s Museum of Modern
Art declared that Dubuffet was “in my estimation the only major painter to emerge in Europe
after World War II.”18 American painters had also long been familiar with Dubuffet’s work,
from a series of exhibits of his paintings at Pierre Matisse’s New York gallery beginning in
1947. In 1951, for example, Jackson Pollock reported to a friend that, to his surprise, “I was
really excited about Dubuffet’s [recent] show.”19
The principal source of Dubuffet’s art lay in what he named Art Brut (Raw Art). He was
inspired by the art of the self-taught or untrained - predominantly the art of the mentally ill, but
also children’s drawings, the graffiti of Paris’ slums, and the cave paintings of Lascaux. He
admired this art for its simplicity, its power, and its expressiveness, and he sought to match these
qualities in his own work. He rejected cultural refinement and traditional concepts of artistic

13
beauty, and his goal was to create art that represented the viewpoint of the common man.
Dubuffet’s art was figurative, with recognizable subjects presented as two-dimensional
outlines; he once wrote that his intent was to “seek ingenious ways to flatten objects on the
surface.”20 He devoted considerable effort to devising new technical procedures, including the
use of accidental effects, that would help him eliminate traditional values from his art. He chose
objects that were banal and mundane, and he drew them crudely, often with exaggeration. He
consistently looked for unconventional materials that he could use to produce unconventional
images. When he used oil paint he often thickened it with sand or glue, to give his works a
rough surface, and at times he instead used tar, plaster, asphalt, and even mud. During the 1950s
he made one series of collages composed entirely of butterfly wings, and another of dried leaves,
tree bark, flowers, and roots; he also made sculptures of crumpled newspapers, lumps of coal,
sponges, and other found objects. In telling a friend of the collages made with botanical
elements, Dubuffet wrote that “They aim also (like all my work, I believe) to provide a slight
upset in the mind in recourse to the absurd and delirious.”21
Dubuffet studied art as a young man, but abandoned it because of his dislike for existing
values. After working as a wine merchant for nearly two decades he returned to art in 1942, at
the age of 41. His methods were those of an experimental artist, as he proceeded by trial and
error, without preconceived results. During the 1950s, for example, he produced works he called
assemblages by cutting up and reassembling painted surfaces. He wrote about these later:
This assemblage technique, so rich in unexpected effects,
and with the possibilities it offers of very quickly changing the
effects obtained through modifying the disposition of the
haphazard pieces scattered on a table, and thus of making
numerous experiments, seemed to me an incomparable laboratory
and an efficacious means of invention. This said, I admit that I am

14
often satisfied with imperfect realizations, in a hurry to go on to
other experiments, and so put off to a later date developing them
with greater application.
It is true that what I have just said about these assemblages
in ink applies equally to most of my paintings (perhaps all of
them), for they are usually done in the same spirit of research and
experimentation, with the idea of developing them more carefully
later. This I often fail to do, impatient as I am to go on to other
experiments. Besides, I really believe that the hasty and
unfinished character of a painting adds to the pleasure it gives me,
and I seldom feel that the effects I have sketched need a more
meticulous execution.
He later returned to the point to emphasize that his concern was more with the development of
processes for making paintings than with actually producing finished results:
Whatever the relative success of these Tableaux d’Assemblages
looked at from the point of view of realization, I can say with
complete assurance that for anyone who might consider this
method as at least a factor of improvisation and experimentation,
as a spur to imagination, as a gymnastic exercise to free painting
from inherited conventions and inhibiting prejudices, as a
stimulant to inventiveness in every domain (subject, composition,
drawing, coloring) or at least as a preliminary means toward the
realization of future paintings that would not even resort to this
method - it is extremely exciting and fruitful.22
Dubuffet produced an enormous amount of art between 1942 and his death in 1985. He
is not known particularly for any individual masterpiece, or for the work of any single period;
the critic John Russell observed of his situation in the late 1950s that “the level of his work to
date was uncommonly even,” and the evidence of the textbooks suggests that this assessment can
be extended further.23 Thus Table 11 shows that no less than 25 different years of his career are
represented in the French texts, including 1984, the last full year of his life, when he was 83. As
noted above, there are no pronounced peaks in Dubuffet’s career, as no single year accounts for
more than one-tenth of his total illustrations, and Table 11 shows that over a career span of 40

15
years there is no period of more than 3 years that is not represented by any illustrations.
Dubuffet worked independently, he did not found a school or movement, and he did not
have a group of direct followers. He is not recognized primarily for any one specific
contribution, but his materials, techniques, and images influenced a variety of younger artists.
Thus artists as diverse as Anthony Caro, David Hockney, Claes Oldenburg, and Cy Twombly all
specifically acknowledged debts to Dubuffet’s work.24 More generally, Dubuffet’s rejection of
beauty in art and his use of crude materials have been credited with helping to create the
conditions for Pop Art and other movements of the 1960s.25
After Dubuffet, the most highly placed French artist of the older generation in the French
rankings is Pierre Soulages. His art was a type of gestural abstraction often referred to as
Tachisme, from the French word for blot or splash, or more broadly as Art Informel (art without
form). Soulages’ black-and-white paintings are often compared to those of Franz Kline, and
Soulages’ accounts of his work closely resemble the experimental attitudes of the American
Abstract Expressionists. Thus he spoke of the uncertainty of his goals, and how he learned in the
course of working:
What I do tells me what I am seeking, but at the time I discover it
only vaguely or partially. A retrospective exhibition, in leading
me to examine the past, is always an experience that helps me to
see more clearly what I have pursued.
He painted by instinct:
Often I decide to do something, to intervene in a certain way and I
don’t know why, and I don’t seek to know why. It’s obvious to me
that I have to do that, but I don’t study it.
For Soulages the process of making a painting was one of discovery:
It’s a kind of dialogue between what I think is being born on the

16
canvas, and what I feel, and step by step, I advance and it
transforms itself and develops, becomes clearer and more intense
in a way that interests me or not. Sometimes it surprises me; those
aren’t the worst times, when I lose my way and another appears,
unexpectedly.
The decision that one of his paintings was finished was made on visual grounds, over a period of
time:
When I see that I can’t add much without changing everything, I
stop and consider that the picture is finished for the moment, that
for now it should remain as it is. Then I turn the picture to the wall
and I don’t look at it for several days, several weeks, sometimes
several months. And then when I look at it again, if it still seems
to accomplish something, if it seems alive, then it can leave the
studio.26
Soulages’ birthdate of 1919 placed him at the end of the cohort of experimental artists,
and in consequence his most influential work was done in the 1950s, the last decade dominated
by that cohort before the conceptual revolutions of the 1960s. Yet the continuing evolution of
his work thereafter accounts for the fact that the textbooks also contain illustrations of work he
did through the 1960s, ‘70s, ‘80s, and even the ‘90s, when he had passed the age of 70.
Yves Klein is the second highest-ranked French artist overall in both the American and
French rankings of Tables 3 and 4. That Klein could make a substantial contribution in spite of
his premature death in 1962, at the age of just 32, is a direct consequence of his conceptual
approach to art. This approach is reflected in both sets of textbooks, for the American authors
judge Klein’s work of 1960 to constitute the most important contribution made in a single year
by any French artist in this sample, while the French texts go farther, judging it the greatest
contribution of a single year by any artist in the sample.
All of Klein’s work was motivated by his fascination with the void. His trademark

17
monochrome paintings were intended to avoid technical and aesthetic concerns and lead viewers
to what the critic Pierre Restany called a meditative “moment of truth.”27 Most of the
monochromes were made in the ultramarine blue that Klein patented in 1960 under the name
IKB, or International Klein Blue. His choice of blue was prompted by its lack of association
with the material or tangible: “blue, at the very most, recalls the sea and sky, which are the most
abstract aspects of tangible and visible nature.”28
Klein initially became known for his monochromes. Yet although the monochromes are
recognized by the textbooks, they are not presented as his primary achievements. In both sets of
books, the majority of illustrations for his peak year of 1960 are of a different series of works,
which he introduced in that year. Klein had long dreamt of flying, and in 1960 he arrived at a
new means of producing images of weightless human bodies in space. Under his direction, nude
models would apply IKB to their bodies, then press themselves against large sheets of paper
tacked to the wall or spread on the floor. These paintings were initially made before audiences first in front of friends at Klein’s apartment, then a few weeks later at a Paris art gallery, before
100 invited guests. At the first of these sessions, Pierre Restany gave the works the name Klein
subsequently adopted, calling them anthropometries.29 For Klein, the use of “living brushes”
that recorded images under his direction allowed him to create visual representations of human
energy that were more natural and universal than any product of an artist’s hand: “By
maintaining myself at a specific and obligatory distance from the surface to be painted, I am able
to resolve the problem of detachment.”30 The desirability of this detachment followed from
Klein’s belief that the essence of art was immaterial, and consequently that the artist should
conceive works of art but not produce physical objects: “True ‘painters and poets’ don’t paint

18
and don’t write poems.”31
The eventual importance of the anthropometries stemmed not only from their visual
images of levitating figures, but also from the manner, and the initial setting, of their execution.
Since Klein was not directly involved in the application of paint to the paper on which the
models made their imprints, the anthropometries were an early example of the concept of the
executive artist that would later be used extensively by Warhol, Stella, and other artists of the
‘60s. And the public production of the first anthropometries made them an early instance of
performance art, which also rose to great prominence later in the decade.
The significance of Klein’s work of 1960 thus stems from his role as one of the
conceptual innovators who ushered in the decade of the ‘60s , that would come to be dominated
by conceptual art.32 The sudden and discrete nature of his contribution is indicated by the timing
of the textbook treatments: of Klein’s total of 29 illustrations in the French texts, only 2 are of
work done before 1960, and only 6 are from the two years of his life that remained after 1960,
while 21 date from that single peak year.
The one other French artist whose work of a single year places him within the top 10
positions in the French ranking of Table 8 is Martial Raysse, for his work of 1963. Since Raysse
was just 27 in that year - the only artist with a younger entry in the table is Jasper Johns - it is not
surprising that his art was conceptual.
Raysse was among the founding members of a French group (that also included Klein)
that established itself in 1960 under the name of Nouveau Réalistes (New Realists). Raysse’s
work at the time consisted primarily of sculptures assembled from consumer goods purchased at
variety stores: he presented these objects just as he bought them because he felt they expressed

19
modern society.33 During the next few years, Raysse’s work moved closed to American Pop art,
and Raysse settled in the US in 1962.34 His paintings of 1963 typically used photographic
images of beautiful women, transformed by the use of gaudy colors, with artificial flowers and
other objects attached to the canvas, to produce images that were often considered a variant of
American Pop art.
Raysse’s artistic career has continued to the present, but his work after 1963 receives
little attention from the textbooks: the French books follow the 8 illustrations of his work of
1963 with only 2 more, from the mid-‘60s. The texts therefore imply that - like other minor Pop
artists of the early ‘60s who are not included in this study - Raysse made a single significant
conceptual contribution at an early age.
Conclusion
This comparison of American and French assessments of the relative importance of the
two countries’ leading painters of the two generations after World War II does hold some
surprises for Americans, though perhaps not for French scholars. Whereas Americans have a
simple view of this competition, the French view is more complex.
American scholars clearly subscribe to a belief in the superiority of the American artists.
By the metric of illustrations in textbooks written by Americans, all the leading artists of both
generations were Americans, as Pollock, de Kooning, and Rothko of the first generation, and
Johns, Rauschenberg, Warhol, and Stella of the second, all rank ahead of any French artist.
Dubuffet follows this group, and is the only French artist to rank ahead of more than 2
Americans; 17 of the 19 French artists rank below all the 15 Americans in the sample.
French textbooks present a more complicated ranking. The French authors concede that

20
the major movements of the ‘50s and ‘60s were led by Americans: thus Pollock’s Abstract
Expressionism places him above any of France’s Tachistes, Warhol’s Pop Art places him above
any of the Nouveau Réalistes, and Johns and Rauschenberg rank above any French artists of the
‘60s for their role in the transition to the conceptual art of that decade. But the French don’t
concede that the other Americans in these movements dominated French artists, as Soulages
ranks above de Kooning, Rothko, and the other Abstract Expressionists, and Klein stands above
Stella, Lichtenstein, and the other Americans of the ‘60s. And perhaps most striking of all is the
French scholars’ ranking of Dubuffet as the most important artist in this entire sample - only
narrowly ahead of Pollock, but well above all the other Americans.
Dubuffet’s position as an important artist is unusual in the history of modern art, for he
did not work closely with other artists, and he was not a member of a larger movement.
Nonetheless, he was a transitional figure who broke with the French fine art tradition, and his
work foreshadowed, even if it did not directly inspire, many of the radical artistic developments
of the ‘60s. Although American art scholars have long respected Dubuffet, most would probably
be surprised at the consensus of French scholars revealed here, which places him above Pollock,
Johns, Warhol, and the other Americans of his time as the key figure of these cohorts.
A few simple quantitative measures emphasize the disagreements between American and
French scholars. This survey of French texts found that 4 Americans and 2 French painters were
represented by an average of at least one illustration per book. In contrast, in the American texts
12 Americans and only one French artist had an average of one or more illustrations per book.
Similarly, French texts included an average of at least one-half illustration per book for 10
Americans, and 10 French artists; American texts gave this number to 15 Americans, and only 3

21
French artists. Perhaps most telling of all is a single comparison. The 34 artists in the sample
considered here collected a total of 671 illustrations in the American texts, and 610 in the French
texts. In the American texts, 552 of these illustrations, or 82%, were of work by Americans,
whereas in the French texts only 312, or 51%, were of the work of Americans. The American
texts’ ratio of American to French illustrations was thus a remarkable 4.6:1, while this ratio for
the illustrations in the French texts was just 1.05:1.35
These comparisons leave little doubt that there is a sharp contrast in French and
American perceptions of the relative importance of the two countries’ leading artists of the
decades after World War II. Yet beyond the measurement of scholars’ judgments of the relative
importance of these artists, this study has revealed the similarity of the artists’ careers across
national boundaries. Thus both the French and American artists born before 1920 tended to
produce their best work later in their careers than did artists of both nationalities of the next
generation. The similarity of these career patterns was in turn due to common approaches and
conceptions of art, as both in France and the US the leading artists of the 1950s were
experimental innovators, whereas in both countries the leading artists of the next generation were
conceptual innovators. Just as convergence of prices reflects the integration of a market for
commodities, the convergence of career patterns observed here reflects the convergence of a
market for ideas. In the decades after World War II, artists in France and the US were
influenced by the same artistic traditions, and shared the same artistic conceptions and methods.
While French and American scholars may disagree over the relative merit of their nations’
artists, there is no disagreement that the most important art of the ‘50s was produced by
experimental seekers, and that of the ‘60s by conceptual finders.36

In an earlier era, the dominance of large group exhibitions in the art world had given
painters a strong incentive to embody their innovations in impressive individual works
that could attract attention even when hung among large numbers of paintings by many
painters. By the time considered in this study, however, one-man shows in private
galleries had become the principal format for exhibitions, and the incentive fir artists was
consequently to produce a group of paintings that would together make up an impressive
show. The measure of Tables 7 and 8 recognizes this incentive. For discussion of the
change in exhibition formats and its impact on artists’ practices, see David W. Galenson,

American Artists,” Historical Methods, forthcoming.

The rankings of Tables 7 and 8 demonstrate that art historians consider Klein’s work to
have been influential in contemporary art. Yet in 1967 critic John Canaday reacted to a
Klein retrospective by denouncing his art as “stuntsmanship” that consisted of no more
than “a series of tricks,” and the exhibition itself as an “exaltation of nonsense;” Culture
Gulch (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1969), pp. 84-87. These accusations of
artistic insincerity and incompetence have become increasingly common charges against
conceptual innovators since Marcel Duchamp, but they date back farther, at least to the
conceptual innovations of the late 19th and early 20th centuries; Galenson, Painting
outside the Lines, Chapter 8.

E.g. see David Britt, ed., Modern Art (New York: Thames and Hudson, 1999), p. 353.

35.

If we drop 4 French artists to equalize the number of artists by country, the ratio of
illustrations of American to French artists in the French texts rises only to 1.15:1.

36.

For a discussion of the generational predominance of experimental and conceptual
innovation in modern art, see Galenson, Painting outside the Lines, Chaps. 8-9.
