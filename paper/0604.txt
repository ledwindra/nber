Inflation, Taxation and Corporate Investment:
A Q Theory Approach

ABSTRACT

This paper examines the role of taxation and inflation in determining
the market valuation of corporate capital and the level of investment.

It

extends previous work on the q theory of investment by incorporating the
effects of taxes levied at the individual level and by focusing on the
impact of inflation.

The q theoretic approach makes it possible to study

the effect of policy announcements and of temporary policies.

The

resulting model of the investment process is immune from the "Lucas
critique".

The estimated relationships are technological and independent

of the choice of policy rule.
The empirical results indicate that tax policy and inflation have
potent effects on both the stock market and investment.

These effects

depend critically on whether or not policy is announced in advance.
Simulations based on q investment equations indicate that an increase in
the rate of inflation from 0 to 8 percent would cause an immediate 23
percent decline in the stock market, and a 35 percent increase in the
capital stock.

Changes in tax policy also have a large effect.

The

estimated speed of adjustment of the capital stock is surprisingly slow,
with less than half the adjustment occurring within 10 years following
typical shocks.

INTRODUCTION

The last decade has witnessed a striking decline
in the market valuation of corporate capital.

In 1967,

the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 1600 expressed
in today's dollars compared to 800 as this is written.

As

theory would predict, the reduction in the valuation of
existing corporate assets .has retarded investment.

Indeed,

the rate of growth of the non-financial corporate capital
stock has fallen considerably from 4.8 percent during the
19.60."5 to 3.9. pe+:cent during the 1970's.

This paper ex-

amines the extent to which the interaction of inflation
and taxation can account for these phenomena.

It also

provides an alternative to the traditional econometric
framework for estimating the effects on investment and
the stock. market of changes in corporate and individual
tax rules.
The dependence of aggregate investment on the level
of the stock market has been widely recognized.

As Tobin

argued, increases in the return to capital will raise the
market value of existing capital signaling the profitability
of additional investment.

Additional investment will drive

down the marginal product of capital, reducing the asset

-2-

price of capital goods until equilibrium is restored.

While

models linking the stock market to investment have been
estimated, they have not been used to examine the impact
of economic policies on investment.

This paper develops

a method of using investment equations based on stock market
valuation to evaluate the effects of changes in capital
income taxes.

The model relies on the assumption that the

stock market valuation of corporate capital represents the
present value of its future profit stream.

By calculating

the effects of tax changes on future profits their impact
on the stock market is estimated.

This is used as a basis

for estimates of their effect on corporate capital accumulation.
This approach has several advantages when compared
to previous empirical approaches to modelling investment.
Almost all previous evaluations of tax policy's impact on
investment have relied on single equation models linking
investment to its proximate determinants, usually output and
the cost of capital.

For the most part, individual taxes

have been ignored and the process of adjustment has been
handled in an ad hoc fashion.

Most critically, existing

approaches to modelling investment decisions are subject
to the "Lucas criticism".

The estimated parameters are not

likely to be invariant to the choice of policy

rules~

The

equations thus do not provide a busis for estimating the

-3-

true effects of changes in policy rules.

This failing is

seen by considering the effect on investment of a tax change
announced in year 1, which will take effect in year 2.
Standard "backward looking" investment equations imply that
such announcements have no immediate impact on investment.
The general theoretical approach developed here makes use
of the fact that stock market valuation reflects expectation
of future policies as well as the effects of taxes levied
at the individual level.

It can be used to assess a richer

variety of tax changes than are normally considered.
The results suggesi that changes in inflation and
tax rules have very important effects on capital accumulation
and asset prices.

However, because adjustment costs appear

to be substantial, the effects of tax policy on investment
are slow to manifest themselves.

For example, the results

suggest that the elimination of capital gains taxes would
raise the ultimate capital stock by 29 percent, but raise the
capital stock by only 4 percent within five years.

It appears,

however, that the interaction of inflation and taxation can account
for a significant fraction of the decline in the stock market
and capital formation which has occurred during the 1970's.
The second section of the paper

outlines a "q" model

of investment and uses it to examine the dynamics of market

-4-

valuation and capital accumulation.

The effects of intro-

ducing a simple tax system are considered.
The third section of the paper considers explicitly
the optimization problem of a value maximizing firm in the
presence of taxation and adjustment costs.

It is shown that

the optimal investment decision at any point in time can be
written as a simple function of the firm's market value,
its capital stock and the tax parameters.

The results of

estimating this "tax adjusted q" investment equation are
reported in section four.

This section also discusses the

estimation of the other parameters of the model.

The fifth

section of the paper uses the estimates developed in the
previous section to examine the effect of increases in inflation on capital accumulation and taxation.

It is shown that

the non-indexed character of the tax system can account for
a large part of the decline in the stock market and investment
which has taken place over the last decade.

The likely effects

of continued inflation on capital accumulation are also
examined, along with the effects of indexing the tax system.
Estimates of the effects of tax reforms on the stock market
and investment are presented in the sixth section of the
paper.

Reforms considered include changes in

the

investment tax credit, corporat.e tax integration, corporate tax rate

-5-

reduction, and the abolition of capital gains taxation.
The dynamics of the response to announced changes in future
tax rates are also examined.

The seventh and final section

of the paper discusses some implications of the results and
suggests directions ,for future research.

II.

THE STOCK MARKET AND CAPITAL ACCUMULATION

This section examines the dynamics of investment
and market valuation in a simplified model where all investment is financed through retained earnings and the only tax
is a proportional levy on corporate income.

In this setting

it is reasonable to assume that investment depends on the
ratio of the market value of existing capital to its replacement cost.

Unless the market value of the firm will be

increased by more than one dollar

by

a one dollar invest-

ment, there is no reason for it to be undertaken.
costs of adjustments and

lags

Given

in recognition and implementa-

tion, there is no reason to expect that all investments which
will raise market value by more than their cost will be made
immediately.

As Tobin (1969) has argued, these considerations

lead to an investment equation of the form:

-6-

I

I(l)

=

( 1)

=a

I' >

where I represents gross investment and V/K is the "q"
ratio of market value to replacement cost.
that i t is IlK which depen:1s

The assumption _

on q insures that the growth

rate of the capital stock does not depend upon the scale
of the economy.
It is assumed that equity owners require a fixed
real rate of return p to induce them to hold the existing
stock of equity.

This return comes in the form of dividends,

equal to after tax profits less retentions for new investment, and capital gains.

Hence we have the condition:

(2 )

which implies:

v = pV

(l-T)

F' (K) K
,

where

t

+

I

(~) K +

is the corporate tax rate, and F(K)

oK

(3 )

is the production

function for net output.

(.ll

A rigorous foundation for an investment equation of this
type is provided in the next section. The analysis in
this section is only intended to be illustrative since
adjustment costs are neglected. An important implicit
assumption of this .approach is the homogeneity of capital.
If capital is heterogeneous, shocks may reduce the market
value of existing capital but raise the return on new investment. The recent energy shock illustrates this phenomenon.

-7-

It will be most convenient to examine the dynamics in
terms of K and q

= R.

Equations (I) and (3) imply that

the system's equations of motion are:

K = I{q)K
q = [p -

(4)

- 15K

I{q) + oJq + I{q) -

(l-T)F' (K)

-

(5)

0

where 0 is the rate of depreciation.
The steady state properties of the model are easily found
by imposing the conditions

K=

0 and

q=

O.

These imply:

(6)

(l-L)F'

(K)

=

pq

( 7)

The former equation indicates that the steady state value
of q must be greater than 1 by an amount just large enough
to induce sufficient investment to cover depreciation.

The

latter equation holds that firms equate their net marginal
product of capital to the cost of capital.

Inspection of

(6) and (7) makes it clear that a change in the corporate
tax rate affects the steady state capital stock but has no
effect on steady state q.

This is a consequence of the

assumption that it is investment relative to the capital
stock which varies with q.

-8-

The phase diagram of the system (4) and (5) is
displayed in Figure 1.

It is readily verified that the

pair of equations is saddle point stable (2) .

The arrows

indicate the directions of motion and the heavy line
represents the saddle point path along which the system
will converge.

A change in the corporate tax rate is

depicted in Figure 2 ( 3 ) •

If the expectations about pre-

tax profits were static, the value of q would Jump from E
to A

when

the tax chan:Je took place. This expectations assumption

has been used in previous work on the effects of taxation on the
stock market,

(Feldstein (1979), Hendershott (1979).

It

neglects the effect of the induced changes in investment
on the present value of future profits.

With perfect fore-

sight, as assumed here, the value of q will jump only to B.
The magnitude of the jump will depend upon the speed of
adjustment of the capital stock to the shock.
The system of equations (4) and (5) can be solved
numerically to estimate the impact of any type of shock
on the path of q and the capital stock.

This is a common feature of models with asset prices.
Abel (1979) was the first to use an approach of this
type to analyze investment incentives.
It is assumed that the market selects the unique stable

tax changes on the level of the stock market can then
be easily calculated.

This is the approach taken below

to estimating the effects of tax changes.

In the next

section the firm's optimization problem is considered
explicitly, and the tax structure is enriched.

The dynamics

parallel those described above.

III.

THE FIRM'S OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM

In what follows the behavior of a representative,
competitive firm seeking to maximize the market value of
its equity is considered.

We begin by examining how

individuals value corporate stock, and then turn to the
firm's decision problem.

Throughout, it is assumed that

firms neither issue new equity, nor repurchase existing
shares (4) .

Hence share prices are proportional to the

outstanding value of a firm's equity.

We continue to

assume that equity holders require a fixed real after tax
return P in order to induce them to hold the outstanding
equity.

The value of

p

is not affected by either changes

(4 )

Under the conditions described below firms would
never want to issue new equity.
Legal restrictions
severely limit firms' ability to repurchase their
own shares. A discussion of these restrictions and
the limitations of other mechanisms which might seem
to be functionally equivalent to repurchasing shares
is contained in Auerbach (1979 a ).

-11-

in the tax rules

or the quantity of equity.

While this

assumption may seem extreme, Summers (1980a) shows that in
plausible general equilibrium models, tax changes are
unlikely to have a large impact on the real after tax
return required by equity holders.
p

The required return

is the sum of capital gains and dividends net of tax.

It follows that:

(8)

where c

represents the effective. accrual rate of taxation on capital
gains(S), and eD the tax rate on dividends, and ~ is
the rate of inflation.

Differences in the tax rates faced

by different investors are ignored.

To solve this

differential equation it is necessary to impose a transversality condition.

We do this by requiring that
_

lim V . e

S-+CO

Jl(tS

(

at time t;

P+Tr)du
= 0

This condition precludes the possibility of an explosive
solution to (1).
With the transversality condition satisfied and the
assumption of perfect foresight, the solution to (1)
becomes:

(S) This corresponds to the statutory rate adjusted for
deferral, and the lack of constructive realization at
death.

(10)

In the steady state where taxes, the price level and
dividends are held constant, this expression reduces to:

(11)

In this case capital gains taxes do not matter because
there are no capital gains.

More generally, as in (10)

capital gains taxes raise the discount rate on future
dividends, as well as affecting the valuation of current
dividends.

Note that equation (10) implies that because

of dividend taxes an extra dollar of promised dividends
D
raises share valuation by only (l-e ).
The firm seeks to choose an investment and financial
policy to maximize (10) subject to the constraints it faces.
It is constrained by its initial capital stock and by a
sources equal uses of funds requirement.

It will also be

necessary to assume that credit market constraints do not
permit the firm to finance more than a fraction(6) of its

(6)

This is a crude way of modelling the effects of bankruptcy
costs on the firm's choice of a debt equity ratio. As
noted below, the ~ssumption of a constant debt-capital
ratio is a fairly good representation of the recent
American experience. McDonald (1980) treats the choice
of financial pOlicy in more detail.

-13-

investment through debt finance.

In the model presented

below, this constraint will always be binding, so we
assume that a share b of all new investment comes from
debt issues and the remainder is financed through retained
earnings.

Finally, the firm cannot change its capital

stock costlessly.

The cost of installing extra capital

is assumed to rise with rate of capital accumulation.

For con-

venience, it is assumed that the cost function is convex and homogeneous in investment and capital.

Under these conditions dividends

(7)

The assumption here is that all marginal equity finance
comes from retained earnings. This'follows from the
assumption of a constant number of shares made earlier.
It accounts for some of the apparently parad0xical results
described below. The last term reflects the net receipts
from new debt issues (wi thdravla19) necessary to maintain the
debt-capital ratio as the capital stock depreciates and the
price level rises.

~

is the adjustment cost function which is assumed to be con-

vex, I represents investment, oR is the real rate of depreciation,
and D represents the value of currently allowable depreciation
allowances.

It has been assumed that adjustment costs are ex-

pensed and ineligible for the investment tax credit. (8)
The tax law is assumed to allow for exponential depreciation
at rate oT that may differ from oR, but to be based on historical
cost.

(14)

(8)

Assuming that adjustment expenses were treated as investment
under the tax law would not importantly alter the results.
If these costs are taken to represent managerial effort, or
as interference with concurrent production, the assumption
in the text is appropriate.

In maximizing (14) the firm can ignore Bt

The

The first order conditions for optimality are(9):

if the shadow price of new capital goods is less than 1.
This is because taxes and debt finance reduce the effective
price of new capital goods.

Equation (17b) is of no operational significance
as a theory of investment unless an observable counterpart
to the shadow price Alp can be developed.

has shown in a similar model with a less elaborate tax
system how the shadow price is linked to the market valuation
of existing capital.

It also implies an equation of motion for

These expressions are equivalent to those derived
by Auerbach (1979a, 1979b).

Assuming all equity finance and

ignoring the investment tax credit, equation (26) yields his
formula for steady state q.

The value of steady state q

is less than one because of the difference between dividend
and capital gains tax rates.

Firms find it optimal to invest

past the point where a dollar's expenditure raises market value
by a dollar, since the alternative is to payout heavily taxed
dividends.

The latter expression holds that the cost of

capital is a weighted average of the costs of debt and equity
capital.

Note that cost of equity capital

depends only on the

capital gains tax rate and not on the dividend rate.

That is

to say permanent dividend taxation has no distortionary effects.
Permanent increases in the dividend tax rate are the cause of an
immediate fall in the stock market, exactly offsetting the
reduced opportunity cost to shareowners of investment funds.

capital ratio.
In
Auerbach's work it refers to the debt-market value ratio.
The results here would not be importantly altered but the
calculations would become much more complex if a constant

For given tax parameters, the phase diagram for the
system (22) and (23) looks just like that one depicted in
Figure 1.

It also exhibits saddle point stability.

There

is again a unique path, indicated by the heavy arrows, along which
the system can converge to equilibrium.

On this perfect

foresight path, investment is just sufficient to actualize
the market's expectations about future dividends.

changes, market valuation and investment.
Consider for example an increase in the investment
tax credit as shown in Figure 3.
stock unambiguously increases.

The steady state capital
In the long run the value

of q falls since the credit reduces the "effective" replacement cost of capital goods.

The short run impact on stock

market valuation is ambiguous, depending on the rapidity of
adjustment.

It is possible for q to jump to any point

between A, corresponding to no capital stock adjustment,
and B, corresponding to an instantaneous adjustment of the
capital stock.

It is thus possible that the stock market

may decline even though investment has been encouraged.
Exactly parallel results hold for a decline in the capital
gains tax rate, or acceleration of tax depreciation.

An

increase in the corporate tax rate, as shown in Figure 4,
has an ambiguous effect on long run capital accumulation.

of adjustment costs and the increased value of untaxed

Hence the value of the market will

unambiguously decline in the short run, but the short run
impact on investment and the long run impact on the capital
stock are indeterminate.
A substantial virtue of the approach to modelling
investment decisions developed here is that it can easily
be used to analyze the effects of announced but not yet
implemented tax changes, and temporary tax measures.

This

can be illustrated by considering the effects of an announcement that at some point in the future, the dividend tax rate

There is no immediate effect on either schedule.

At time t,

when the tax increase takes effect, both schedules shift downwards as shown by the dashed lines.

As already noted, a

dividend tax change has no impact on long run capital intensity.
But the change does alter the timing of investment decisions.
Firms have an incentive to pay

extra dividends before the

dividend tax increase takes effect, and to pay lower subsequent dividends.

Note that the announce-

ment of the tax reduces investment but that investment rises
sharply at the moment when it takes effect.
All these examples illustrate cases where tax changes
can have opposite effects on the stock market and investment.
This demonstrates the importance of taking tax factors into
account in estimating relations between market valuation and
investment.

This is done in the next section which describes

the estimation of the model outlined above.

Several authors including Von Furstenberg (1977),

With the exception of

(1977), no account was taken of tax effects.

Cicco-

lo's tax adjustments differ from. those used here because he
takes no account of individual taxes, and implicitly makes
different assumptions about the tax treatment of adjustment
costs. Theee studies have all related components of business
fixed investment to q, which may not be appropriate for noncorporate investment.

They have all been confined to the post-

Korean War period during which tax changes have been relatively
minor.
In order to focus on tax effects, the work reported here
examined the determinants of non-financial corporate investment over the entire 1932-1978 period. The extension of the
sample period allows the substantial variation in tax parameters.
.58

The dividend tax rate has varied between .15

and

during the period while the corporate rate has varied

between

.18 and .70.

Extending the equation back this far

necessitates some crudeness in the calcualtion of Q, and forces
the use of annual data.

Since the focus here is on long

run issues, this is probably not too serious a problem.
The calculation of the various components of Q is described below.

A full listing of all the series is included

C --- It is difficult to measure the effective capital
gains tax rate because of the problems inherent in estimating
the effects of deferral and the absence of constructive rea1ization at death.

Following Bailey (1969) we assume that each

of these factors halves the effective rate.

From 1932-1969,

the statutory rate on capital gains was half the rate on dividends.

Hence for this period the capital gains rate' was

estimated at 12.5% of the average marginal dividend tax rate.:{.13}
For the 1969-1978 period, the effect of the 1969 capital gains
reforms is proxied by assuming that the capital gains rate
is 50% higher or 18.75% of the dividend rate. (14)

is fitted to the previous 20 years'data. Expected
inflation is then a 10 year disoounted average of the forecasts
of the future inflation rates. The discount rate is .08.
The calculation is performed using the consumer price
index.
(12) This procedure would only be strictly appropriate if all
bonds were conso1s. Comparing the resu1ts~ with those
of Von Furstenberg's (1977) more careful adjustment
suggests that the error is not likely to be large.
(13) The construction of this series is discussed below.
(14) These reforms included the minimum tax, maximum tax,
and special provisions relating to preference income.
The estimate that these reforms raised effective rates
by about 50 percent is derived from the NBER TAXSIM
model.

The marginal tax rate on dividends is estimated

is the statutory rate, as adjusted by ORI to reflect the
effects of eligibility rules, times the share of investment

The estimated values of Q are shown in Table 1 along
with estimated values of q as normally calculated.

The most

striking feature of the table is the pronounced drop in q
over the fifty year period.

The value of q actually peaked

in 1937.

Tax factors can account for a large part of this

decline.

Rising dividend and corporate tax rates have

reduced equilibrium market values.

Indeed, such factors

would lead one to predict a drop of about 30 percent in q

Taxes also account for another

apparent anomaly in the data.

Despite the fact that many

assets of firms, such as intangibles, are excluded from
the denominator of the q ratio, it appears that q averages
sUbstantially less than 1, and positive investment takes
place.

In contrast, the tax adjusted variable Q is greater

than the investment threshold of zero in every year except
1932. (16)

Indeed, viewed in terms of Q it appears that on

average, the market if anything overvalues corporate assets.
Table 2 presents estimates of simple investment
functions using Q and q as explanatory variables.

The

dependent variable is defined as the change in the net capital
stock plus depreciation divided by the value of the beginning
of year capital stock.

Before examining the results, it is

necessary to make several comments on the estimation.
First, the estimates here are not intended to provide
the best possible fit of actual investment behavior during
the sample period.

justified by the theory, lagged Q's are included in the investment equations to take account of delivery lags and the
inevitable arbitrariness in the time when investment projects
show up in the national income accounts.
The results provide mild evidence that tax adjustments
enhance the power of movements in market valuation in explaining investment.

Using ordinary least squares, q has the

wrong sign, while Q is marginally significant

with the right

sign. (19)
These equations exhibit extreme serial correlation.
When an autocorrelation correction is made as in the third
and fourth equations, there is little to choose between the
two specifications.

The Q equation provides a marginally

better fit and exhibits somewhat less autocorrelation.

(18) This point is amplified in Sims (1972) . It is a variant
in the frequently made observation that autocorrelation
corrections exacerbate the errors in variables problems.
(19) Since OLS gives inconsistent estimates of the standard
errors, not too much can be made of this observation.

-36-

Including lagged values raised the explanatory power of both
equations but does not alter their relative perfonnance.

When

both concepts are entered together, the Q variable completely
dominates the unadjusted variable which becomes statistically
significant with the wrong sign.

Alternative specifications

not shown here suggest that these results are not significantly affected by the inclusion of additional lags, time
trends, or the exclusion of the War years from the sample.
Estimates for the 1954-1978 period yield quite similar
results, though for this shorter period there is no basis
at all for choosing between the q and Q specifications.
The parameter estimates are comparable to those suggested
by previous work.

B. The Production Function
It is assumed that production in the non-financial

This assumption is borne

out by the approximate constancy of factor shares, and appears
to be consistent with the available empirical evidence. (21)
The share of capital in the output of the non-financial
corporate sector averaged .16 during the period 1970-1978.
This is taken to be the share of capital in the production

In the simulations, one additional complication is introduced.
Inflation raises the effective tax rate on corporate capital
by taxing nominal inventory profits of firms using FIFO
accounting.

In 1978 when the rate of inflation was 7.4,

these profits

!represented 24.3 billion or.33 percent of

non-financial corporate output per point of inflation.

It

is assumed in the simulations that each point of inflation
raises the corporate tax base by this fraction of corporate
output.
At this point, the effects of tax and inflation changes
can be studied.

The system of equations (22) and (23) can be

solved numerica1ly(23) to find the path of investment and
the stock market.

This is done in the next section.

This steady state appears

to afford a reasonable benchmark for studying tax changes.

is .134.

While this number is somewhat higher than standard

estimates of the rate of profit, this reflects the fact that
land is omitted from consideration here.

Adjustment costs

are estimated to comprise 9 percent of gross profit. It
is difficult to evaluate this assumption since adjustment
costs are not directly observable. (24)

If adjustment costs

are neglected, estimates of the effects of tax changes are
altered only slightly.

The effective tax rate on corporate

source income is fairly close to the value that was observed
prior to the period of rapid inflation.

Finally, the earnings

price ratio and dividend yield appear to be reasonable.

In

any event experimentation suggested that the estimated impacts of tax changes were not very sensitive to the initial
choice of parameters.

(24) The· level of investment does enter with a significant
negative sign in standard cyclical profit equations
of the type estimated by Feldstein and Summers (1977).

INFLATION EFFECTS

In this section, the model of investment and
market valuation described in the preceeding section is
used to evaluate the impact of inflation on the non-financial
corporate sector.

Four separate non-neutralities of the

tax system lead to real effects of inflation.

25

First,

historical cost depreciation causes inflation to raise the
effective corporate tax rate.

It is important to note

that the understatement of depreciation for tax purposes
depends on the entire history of the inflation rate not just
on its current level.

In 1977, historic cost depreciation

raised corporate tax liabilities by $19.1 billion or 32.4
percent of actual tax liabilities.

Second, firms which use

FIFO inventory accounting incur extra tax liabilities an their
nominal inventory profits.

(26)

The size of this effect varies

In 1977, tax liabilities were

These non-neutralities are discussed in more detail in
Summers (1980b). Evidence of their aggregate importance
can be found in Feldstein und Summers (1979).
Although the extra taxes due to FIFO accounting are in a
sense voluntary, managements presumably pay these taxes
because they believe that there would be greater costs of
some other kind if they used LIFO and reported lower
profits. As long as firms pay higher taxes based on FIFO
accountin~ these taxes do affect investment decisions.

or 27

percent

Third, firms are permitted to deduct

nominal rather than real interest payments for tax purposes.
Equivalently stated, they are not taxed on the capital gain which
they realize as inflation erodes the value of their outstanding debt.

This offsets the effects of historic cost deprecia-

tion and nominal inventory accounting and reduces. the tax
burden on corporate capital by 26.4 percent in 1977!27) Fourth,

corporate capital stock totalled

$112 billion in 1977, implying an extra tax liability of about
$10 billion. (28)
On balance, these effects imply that inflation
substantially increases the effective tax rate on corporate
equity.

(27)

(28)

Feldstein (1979a) has suggested that this could

This discussion and calcualtion ignore the one-time capital
gains firms realize on the revaluation of their long term
debt when the inflation rate rises. Summers (1980b) shows
that this effect can be very substantial for some firms.
This effect is masked by the downwards recapitalization
of the market caused by unexpected increases in the rate
of inflation.

provide an explanation for the observed decline in the stock
market.

This conclusion has been challenged by Hendershott

(1979), Fama (1979) and Modigliani and Cohn (1974).

these analyses have taken account of the endogneity of capital
accumulation and its impact on market valuation.

implications of his
corporate sector.

Only Feldstein considers the

analysis for the long run growth of the
He does not however consider the nature of

the adjustment path after an inflation shock.
Before turning to the results one qualification must
be stressed.

The assumption is maintained throughout that

inflation has no impact on the rate of return required by
equity owners.

This assumption is open to question. (29)

Many

observers have argued that inflation reduces real after tax
interest rates and so should also be assumed to reduce requirec
after tax returns on equity.

( 29)

.This argument presumes that

The arguments of Hendershott (1979), Gordon and Malkie1
(1979), and Modig1ian and Cohn (1979) that inflation
should not discourage investment are based on the assumption that it reduces the real return on other assets
particularly bonds.

-44-

inflation has no effect on the equity risk premium and that
bonds are the relevant alternative asset.

If the alternatives

to holding equity, include tax sheltered fonns
as owner

of saving such

occupied housing, this assumption is inappropriate.

Further, there is theoretical reason to believe that in the
very long run inflation should raise real interest rates. (30)
The effect of inflation on market valuation and
investment is gauged by simulating the effects of an unexpected
permanent increase from 0 to 8 percent in the rate of inflation.
The paths of the variables of interest are shown in Table 4.
All variables are measured as percentage changes from the
benchmark

steady state values displayed in Table 3.

The

results indicate that inflation can have very large effects on
capital accumulation in the corporate sector.

The immediate

effect of the 8 percent inflation shock is to reduce the value
of the stock market by 22.7 percent.

This is associated with

a 16.8 percent reduction in the rate of investment.
As the capital output ratio declines, raising the
pre-tax marginal product of capital, the stock market tends to
rise relative to the replacement cost of the capital stock.

(30)

Summers (1980) suggests that this will take place in
almost any plausible model with non-indexed taxes on
capit;al income.

In the long run the 8 percent rate of inflation reduces the
capital stock by 34.4 percent and the value of the stock
market by 36 percent.

The transition is quite slow.as only

three quarters of the ultimate adjustment of the capital
stock takes place within 20 years.

The impact of inflation

on the rate of investment actually increases over time
reflecting the reduced need for replacement investment as
the capital stock contracts.
These results suggests that inflation can account for
a large part of the decline in the stock market and investment
which has occurred during the last decade.

After 10 years of

8 percent inflation, the stock market is almost 30 percent
lower in real terms than it would have been in the absence
of inflation.

The 22 percent decline in gross investment

indicated by the simulation is somewhat larger than the decline
which has actually occurred.

This probably reflects the

increases in the investment tax credit, and the acceleration
of tax depreciation which have

~

place during the 1970's!3l)

As shown in the next section, these measures are a significant
spur

to investment, but are not likely to significantly increase

stock market values.

(31)

The investment tax credit was suspended at the beginning
of the decade and applied at a 9 percent rate in 1979.
The ADR system introduced in 1971 has shortened depreciation lifetimes by about 20 percent.

-47-

The results in Table 4 suggest that 8 percent inflation slows the rate of growth of the capital stock by about
1.1 percent a year for the first decade.

The production

function used here implied that this leads to a decline of
about.2 percent a year in the rate of growth of productivity.
The long run impact of inflation according to these calculations
is to reduce corporate sector output and wages by about 6
percent below the level that would have been reached in the
absence of inflation.

This is a quite substantial effect.

It

implies that if inflation continues at current ratio until the
year 2000, per-capita output of the corporate sector in that year will
be reduced by $420 a year below its no inflation level.
These results suggest that inflation has substantial
effects on market valuation and investments.

It is frequently

proposed that these non-neutralities be remedied through
indexation of the tax system.

The effects of inflation on

the stock market and investment under various partial indexing
schemes

is shown in Table S.

As well as illustrating the

effects of indexing, the Table make it possible to examine the
relative importance of the various distortions associated
with inflation.

Full indexing leaves the tax system completely

neutral, so it is not shown in the Table.
Indexing depreciation allowances and inventory accounting
while doing nothing about the profits firms realize on their

-48-

outstanding debt would lead to a situation where inflation
significantly encouraged investment.

Under such indexing

rules, an 8percent increase in the expected rate of inflation
would raise the stock market by 10 percent.
the non-neutrality

This is because

associated with the deduction of nominal

interest payments is greater than the distortion due to the
taxation of capital gains.

These results imply that indexing

depreciation allowances would reduce the equilibrium ratio of
the stock market values to the replacement cost of the capital
stock.

This is because indexation raises the value of

reducing the effective price of new capital goods.
The effects of full indexing at the corporate level are
shown in column (2).

The remaining distortion, the taxation

of nominal capital gains, leads a reduction in the stock market
and capital formation.

The

capital gains distortion alone is

sufficient to cause 8 percent inflation to reduce the steady
state capital, stock by over 11 percent.

Thus the taxation of

nominal capital gains is responsible for about one-third of
the total reduction in capital accumulation caused by inflation.
Indexation at the individual level but not at the corporate
level is considered in the third column of the Table.

The

results show that corporate tax non-neutralities are responsible
for a large fraction of inflation's impact on capital formation.
They show clearly that contrary to assertions made by some

-49-

authors, the effect of inflation on inventory profits and
depreciation allowances more than offsets the deductibility
of nominal interest payments.

This is because the analysis

here takes explicit account of the growth in the understatement
of depreciation allowances which accompanies prolonged inflation.
Space does not permit a detailed discussion of the robustness of these results to changes in the assumptions about the
underlying parameters.

The qualitative results and long run

estimates are almost completely unaffected by plausible changes
in the parameters.

Reductions in the assumed elasticity of

substittltion reduce the sensitivity of tre steady state capital
stock to inflation.

Plausible changes in the adjustment cost

function alter the size of the initial jump in the stock
market and the speed of adjustment, but the effects are not
very large.

VI. ALTERNATIVE TAX REFORMS

This section begins by considering the impact of the
investment tax credit, since this issue has been a focus of
previous work.

Standard single equation approaches to the

investment function have yielded divergent results.

In perhaps

the most widely cited study, Hall and Jorgenson (1971) conclude
that the investment tax credit has a potent impact, which
reaches its peak after about 3 years.

They estimated that the

7 percent creditonequiptment enacted in 1962 raised the 1970
capital stock by about 4 percent above the level it would have
reached in the absence of the credit.

Other estimates

typically suggest much smaller estimates of the effect of the
credit.

None of the estimates takes explicit account of the

possibly temporary nature of changes in the level of the credit.
In Table 6 the effects of
policies are considered.

alternative tax credit

The first column considers the effects

of a correctly perceived permanent removal of the credit.

The

results indicate that the credit has potent effects on investment, even though it has only a small impact on market valuation
in the short run. (32)

Its immediate effect is to reduce

investment by about 6 percent, and it decreases the capital stock
by 8.9 percent in the long run.

The estimated response is

(32) This illustrates the point made in Section III, that changes
in unadjusted q may be a poor guide to investment incentives.

much more gradual than that predicted by standard investment
equations.

The effect on invesment declines between the

first and second years and then rises steadily as the reduced
capital stock requires less replacement investment.
Since the change considered here is the removal of 9 percent
investment credit, these results indicate a slightly larger
effect than those of Hall and Jorgenson, and a much larger
effect than that found in most other studies.
The right-hand half of the table considers the impact
of a temporary removal of the ITC.

Such a measure leads to

a sharp decrease in investment during the suspension period.
This leads to an increase in net investment after the suspension
is removed.

Gross investment does not increase because the

lower capital stock requires less replacement investment.
Note that the catch up following the restoration of the credit
is very slow.

Two thirds of the gap caused by the suspension

in the capital stock remains 15 years later.
show the importance of adjustment costs.

These results

In the absence of

any adjustment costs, one would expect to see substantial
disinvestment
the

during the period of the suspension.

Because

adjustment costs of returning to the steady state capital

stock would be high, this does not take place.

These sim-

ulations suggest that a countercyclical investment credit
might not be destabilizing.

Adjustment costs are sufficiently

large to negate substantial anticipatory effects.

-54-

The effects of reductions in the corporate tax rate
are examined in Table 7.

An immediate rate reduction from

.48 to .40 is contrasted with an announcement that in year 4,
such a tax cut will take place.

Both measures are equivalent

in the long run, and raise the steady state capital stock by
15.7 percent.

They increase the long run value of the stock

market significantly more because the reduced corporate tax
raises the effective price of new capital goods by diminishing
the value of accelerated depreciation and the expanding
of adjustment costs.
The simulations show that the announcement policy has
a significantly greater short run impact on investment than
the immediate implementation policy.

The former raises the

capital stock by 3 percent after 3 years compared with 2 percent
for the latter.

This occurs even though the immediate implemen-

tation policy has a greater immediate impact on the capital
stock.
tion

The reason again is the effects of accelerated depreciaand the expanding of adjustment costs.

Firms find it

optimal to accelerate their investment plans to take account
of the lower effective price of capital goods which prevails
before the tax reduction actually takes place.

This implies

that if the goal of the corporate rate reduction is to increase
capital formation, the measure should be announced
advance of its enactment.

well in

Similar considerations suggest

that a temporary increase in the corporate tax rate would
actually spur investment.

The effects of reforms in the individual tax system are
considered in Table 8.

Eliminating capital gains taxes would

raise the stock market by 7.3 percent in the short run.
Because it would increase the advantages to the firm of
retaining earnings, the impact on investment is substantially
greater.

Its long run effect would be to raise the capital

stock by 29.5 percent.

The transition is however very

gradual with only half the adjustment occurring within the
first decade.

Comparison of Table 8 with Table 5 suggests

that a significant part of the effect of capital gains taxes
takes place because of inflation.
The second reform considered is an announcem"ent that
in year 4, the dividend tax will be eliminated.

This corres-

ponds to an extreme form of partial integration of the corporate
income tax.

As explained in Section III, changes in the dividend

tax rate have no effect on steady state capital intensity.
The announcement that a dividend tax reduction will occur
however gives firms a very large incentive to defer paying of
dividends.

This is done by accelerating investment.

The

simulations suggest that the announcement effect raises investment by 40.5 percent.

VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

This paper has developed and applied a market
valuation approach to evaluating investment incentives.

The

results demonstrate that tax and monetary policies have
large effects on the stock market and investment.

The non-

indexed character of our tax system causes inflation to have
strong impact on market valuation and investment.

Indeed, it

appears that inflation can account for a large fraction of the
decline in the stock market and investment which occurred
during the 1970's.

Reducing the rate of inflation would do

more to increase capital formation than even quite substantial
changes in the tax law.

However the results do strongly

suggest that tax policies have quite significant effects on
capital formation.

The market valuation approach implies

that the lagged response of investment to tax changes is quite
pronounced.

Only half of the response to shocks takes place

within a decade.

This may explain why the estimates

reported

here imply much larger long run effects of tax policies than
previous studies which have focused on a shorter horizon.
There are several directions in which the analysis in
this paper could be usefully extended.

Probably the most

-59-

important would be placing the model of investment developed
here in a general equilibrium context.

Since the corporate

sector represents a substantial fraction of the economy,
measures which affect it will impact on investors' required
rate of return.

Feldstein and Summers (1977) estimate that

tax changes which raise the interest rate firms can afford
to pay on given investment projects 1 percent, increase the
actual interest rate by ,25 percent.

Summers (1980c) examines

the steady state properties of a general equilibrium model
with three assests, corporate
and land.

capita~

owner occupied housing

The findings suggest that taking account of general

equilibrium effects would reduce somewhat the partial equilibrium estimates of tax effects reported here.

Appropriate

government monetary polic ies could be directed at keeping
the required real return constant if it were considered desirable to achieve the full partial equilibrium effect of tax changes.
A second important direction for future research is
the implications of uncertainty.

A more satisfactory treat-

ment of uncertainty would make it possible to model the determinants of corporate financial policy and the required risk
premium

.

on equity.

By introducing a diversification motive,

an explicit treatment of uncertainty would make it possible
to meaningfully model the heterogeneo.us tax rates faced by different
investors.

It is difficult to predict how the introduction

of uncertainty would alter the conclusions reached here.

The

-60-

principal new feature would be a risk sharing effect of
taxation which might tend to encourage investment.
The empirical approach described here is potentially
applicable to a wide variety of problems.

Poterba (1980)

has used a similar model to evaluate the impact of inflation
on the market for

~eroccupied

housing.

The approach could

also be applied to modelling the effects of shocks on investment in different industries for a different regions. (33)
With some adaptation the market valuation approach could be
used to evaluate a wide variety of shocks, including regulatory

Industry "qlt investment equations of the type estimated
by von Furstenberg, Malkiel, and Watson (1980) could
be utilized for this purpose. Summers (1980b) shows
that inflation shocks are likely to have divergent effects
on industry "q"s.
This apprach is being used by Poterba and Summers (1980)
to evaluate the effects of local property tax changes.
