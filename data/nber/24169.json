    "abstract": "\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has become a cornerstone of modern business practice, developing from a \u201cwhy\u201d in the 1960s to a \u201cmust\u201d today. Early empirical evidence on both the demand and supply sides has largely confirmed CSR's efficacy. This paper combines theory with a large-scale natural field experiment to connect CSR to an important but often neglected behavior: employee misconduct and shirking. Through employing more than 3000 workers, we find that our usage of CSR increases employee misbehavior - 20% more employees act detrimentally toward our firm by shirking on their primary job duty when we introduce CSR. Complementary treatments suggest that \u201cmoral licensing\u201d is at work, in that the \u201cdoing good\u201d nature of CSR induces workers to misbehave on another dimension that hurts the firm. In this way, our data highlight a potential dark cloud of CSR, and serve to forewarn that such business practices should not be blindly applied.\n\n",
