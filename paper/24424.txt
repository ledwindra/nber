NAFTA and the Wages of Married Women
Shushanik Hakobyan and John McLaren
NBER Working Paper No. 24424
March 2018
JEL No. F13,F16,J31
ABSTRACT
Using US Census data for 1990-2000, we estimate effects of NAFTA on US wages, focusing on
differences by gender. We find that NAFTA tariff reductions are associated with substantially
reduced wage growth for married blue-collar women, much larger than the effect for other
demographic groups. We investigate several possible explanations for this finding. It is not
explained by differential sensitivity of female-dominated occupations to trade shocks, or by
household bargaining that makes married women workers less able to change their industry of
employment than other workers. We find some support for an explanation based on an
equilibrium theory of selective non-participation in the labor market, whereby some of the
higher-wage married women workers in their industry drop out of the labor market in response to
their industry's loss of tariff. However, this does not fully explain the findings so we are left with
a puzzle.

Introduction

The effect of trade on gender inequality has not ever been a prime focus of trade economists,
but gender gaps in income and labor-force participation are of intense policy and political
interest, and can potentially be greatly affected by trade policy. This paper explores the
impact of a major trade shock – the launch of NAFTA – on the wages of male and female
workers in the US in the 1990s.
NAFTA, the most important trade policy change in the US over the last three decades,
was launched on January 1, 1994 and featured a 10-year schedule of tariff phase-out between
the US, Canada and Mexico. Hakobyan and McLaren (2016) examine the effect of US tariff
reductions against imports from Mexico due to NAFTA on US workers’ wage growth in
the 1990s. The findings suggest very heterogeneous effects across US workers of different
educational class that also vary across locations and industries. In particular, NAFTA
is associated with slower wage growth for less skilled workers employed in industries and
residing in locations that were more vulnerable to imports from Mexico. But the paper did
not consider the gender dimension of NAFTA’s potential impact.
Much of the existing literature focuses on trade and the gender wage gap in developing
countries (see Aguayo-Tellez (2012) and Papyrakis et al. (2012) for an extensive survey),
but a number of studies look at the relationship in advanced economies. Black and Brainerd
(2004) study the effects of increased import competition on the gender wage gap across industries and metropolitan areas in the US using the Current Population Survey (CPS) from
1977 to 1994 and the 1980 and 1990 Censuses. They find that the residual (after controlling for individual characteristics) gender wage gap narrowed more rapidly in concentrated
industries that experienced a trade shock than in competitive industries, lending support to
Becker’s (1957) model of discrimination according to which increased market competition
reduces employer discrimination in the long run.
Using US data from 1990-91 and 2006-07, Sauré and Zoabi (2014) examine the effects
of a higher exposure to trade with Mexico on female employment shares and female relative
2

wages across US states, and find that trade expansion had a negative impact on female
employment relative to male in states with greater exports to Mexico. The results remain
robust for married female workers, for female workers of all educational categories (less than
high school, high school graduate and advanced education), and for workers in manufacturing
only. They do not find a significant difference in female relative wage due to higher trade
exposure, attributing it to a selection bias whereby the measured average wages of working
women do not change, while the unmeasured potential wages of nonworking women decrease
(as they leave labor force). Autor et al. (2013) examine the impact of rising Chinese import
competition on U.S. labor market outcomes over the period of 1990-2007 and find that
both male and female employment and the corresponding wages decreased but that these
changes were more pronounced for women. Brussevitch (2016) shows that some portion of
the declining gender wage gap in the US can be explained by differential labor adjustment
costs. She estimates a structural econometric model of dynamic labor adjustment and finds
that, although men tend to have overall lower adjustment costs than women, women have
an advantage in moving into service-sector jobs following a shock to traded-sector labor
demand. None of these papers however addresses the differences in income distribution
by gender, marital status, education, industry of employment and location simultaneously,
which is the focus of this paper.
Studies of trade and the gender wage gap in developing countries are more common
and tend to conclude that trade liberalization improved labor market outcomes of women.
Aguayo-Tellez et al. (2010) document increased female employment rates and female relative
wages in Mexico during the 1990s due to NAFTA, and using establishment-level data for
the Mexican manufacturing sector, show that female wage bill shares increased in response
to reductions in US tariffs on Mexican goods, particularly for skilled blue-collar female
workers. Using the same data from Mexico, Juhn et al. (2014) show that tariff reductions
due to NAFTA increased the ratio of female blue-collar workers to male blue-collar workers
as well as the relative wage of female blue-collar workers, with little evidence for white-collar

3

women’s share and relative wages. Gaddis and Pieters (2014) find that trade liberalization
in Brazil reduced male and female labor force participation and employment rates, but
the effects on men were significantly larger, leading to gender convergence in labor force
participation and employment rates.
This paper borrows from several advances in the literature and builds on the methodological framework developed in Hakobyan and McLaren (2016) to study the differential
impact of tariff reductions on men’s and women’s wage growth and labor force participation
decisions over the 1990s by exploiting the exogenous nature of the NAFTA shock. We use
publicly available US Census data from 1990 and 2000, taken from the IPUMS project at
the Minnesota Population Center (www.ipums.org; see Ruggles et al. (2015)). The richness
of our data allows us to estimate the differential impact of a trade shock within a location,
industry, occupation and educational class.
To anticipate results, we find that reductions in blue-collar wage growth from NAFTA
tariff reductions were much larger for women than for men, and much larger for married
women than for single women, a finding that we refer to as a married-woman differential. We
investigate four possible explanations for this finding: differential sensitivity to shocks across
occupations; household bargaining within a marriage; non-linear preferences interacted with
household bargaining; and selective non-participation in the labor market on the part of
married women. We are able to reject the first three with the data; the fourth appears to
be plausibly a portion of the explanation, but it is unable to explain the full effect. We
therefore conclude with a puzzle.
The rest of the paper proceeds in the following way. Section 2 briefly explains the
methodological framework developed in Hakobyan and McLaren (2016) and presents the
basic results for the wage growth over 1990s for six groups of workers: married men and
women with an employed spouse, married men and women with a spouse who is unemployed
or not in the labor force (NILF) and single men and women. Section 2 concludes by laying
out three stylized facts. Section 3 proposes four possible explanations for our basic findings

4

in Section 2 and develops a simple theoretical model for each explanation followed by further
empirical tests of the proposed theory. Section 4 considers a model of endogenous marriage
to help explain the married-woman differential. Finally, Section 5 summarizes.

Empirical approach and basic results

Our analysis of local labor markets requires a time-invariant definition of local labor markets in the US. We take advantage of consistently defined Public Use Microdata Areas
(conspumas) constructed by and available from IPUMS-USA (Ruggles et al., 2015). There
are 543 conspumas covering both urban and rural areas in the US. Following the empirical specification in Hakobyan and McLaren (2016), we construct a measure of conspuma’s
exposure to NAFTA as 1990 employment share weighted US tariff rate (against Mexican
imports) in 1990, adjusted for Mexico’s relative comparative advantage. We refer to this
measure as average local tariff or local vulnerability.

The variation in this measure comes from three sources: differential concentration of
employment across industries in each conspuma; specialization in industries in which Mexico has comparative (dis)advantage relative to the rest of the world; and the US imposed
differential tariff rates. Analogously, we define industry tariff rates, adjusted for Mexico’s
relative comparative advantage.
The use of the Census data collected in 1990 and 2000 dictates our empirical approach
5

to identifying the effect of NAFTA which went into effect in 1994. The agreement was
framed as a gradual phase-out of tariffs between the three countries, starting in 1994 and
continuing for 10 years (with a few tariffs continuing to 15 years). We focus on exposure to
Mexican imports at the time of NAFTA’s launch because the reduction of tariffs between
the US and Canada had began much earlier with signing of a free trade agreement between
the two countries in 1989. The negotiated schedule of liberalization was different for each
sector of the economy. As a result, for some industries, the period from 1990 to 2000 was
the period of an announcement of tariff reductions, most of which occurred after 2000. For
other industries, the same period saw rapid elimination of tariffs. As a result, we deal with
variation in the timing of liberalization by controlling separately for both the initial tariff
rates in 1990 which capture the potential vulnerability of a location or an industry to imports
from Mexico and actual change in tariffs between 1990 and 2000.
In addition to the differential responses of men and women to a trade shock, we acknowledge that married and single individuals are likely to respond differentially as well.
A married worker may be more constrained in responding to a trade shock, because some
forms of response, such as relocation, require agreement from all members of the household.
Furthermore, the response of a married couple with both husband and wife being employed
may well differ from those couples that have an unemployed spouse or a spouse not in labor
force.
These considerations prompt us to consider the labor market outcomes of exposure to
import competition from Mexico for six groups of workers separately: married men or women
with an employed spouse, married men or women with a spouse who is unemployed or not in
labor force, single men and single women. We focus initially on wage growth between 1990
and 2000. Our rich empirical specification allows for dynamic response of wages for each
group of workers to vary by industry, location and education level (high school dropout, high
school graduate, some college or associate degree, and college graduate). We also allow for
a different rate of wage growth for locations on the US-Mexico border.

resides in conspuma c, works in industry j and has an occupation n, respectively; c(i) is the
index of worker i’s conspuma, and 4τ j(i) and loc4τ c(i) are the changes in tariff for industry
j and location c, as defined at the beginning of this section.
The parameters of primary interest here are δ2,k and δ4,k , which measure the initial-tariff
effect and the impact effect, respectively, for the local average tariff; and θ2,k and θ4,k , which
measure the initial-tariff effect and the impact effect, respectively, for the industry tariff. If
it is easy for workers to move geographically, so that local wage premiums are arbitraged
away, but difficult for workers to switch industry, we will observe δ1,k , . . . , δ4,k = 0 while
θ1,k , . . . , θ4,k 6= 0. In that case, industry matters, but location does not. On the other hand,
if it is difficult for workers to move geographically but easy to switch industries within one
location, we will see the opposite: δ1,k , . . . , δ4,k 6= 0 while θ1,k , . . . , θ4,k = 0. In reporting our
results, we focus on the case when a location or an industry loses all of its protection within
the sample period, thus the effect on wages within the sample period is equal to δ2,k − δ4,k
in a given location and θ2,k − θ4,k in a given industry.
In the regressions below, we use a 5% sample from the US Census for 1990 and 2000,

terms and conspuma, industry and occupation fixed effects, we include the following personal characteristics: age, whether or not the worker speaks English, race, home ownership,
presence of a school-aged child and educational attainment.
Table 1 shows descriptive statistics for the personal characteristics for the six groups of
workers based on gender, marital status and employment status of the spouse. In our sample,
single workers (both male and female) are on average younger (38 and 40 years old), more
racially diverse (76 and 73 percent white), less likely to own a home (55 percent), and less
likely to have a child (19 percent of men and 34 percent of women). Although high-school
dropouts are 11% of the total, this fraction is considerably higher among men and women
with unemployed/NILF spouse and considerably lower among both men and women with
employed spouse. The remainder of the sample is about evenly split between high-school

spouse, while for other groups the fraction of college graduates is smaller than that of high
school graduates and those with some college.
Table 2 summarizes our measures of industry and location vulnerability. The 1990 RCAadjusted industry tariff across 89 traded-goods industries ranges from 0 to 9%, with a mean
of 1%. The initial local average tariff across 543 conspumas ranges from approximately 0.09
to 4.74%, with a mean just above one percent. It is worth pointing out that when computing
local average tariff we omit agriculture by setting its tariff equal to zero because a coarse
aggregation of industries in Census data applies the same tariff to all agricultural crops.2
Table 3 shows the difference between the initial-tariff effect and the change-in-tariff effect
for the main specification in equation (2.2) with all right-hand-side variables and industry,

Standard errors are clustered by conspuma, industry, and year, following Cameron, Gelbach

all groups of workers and are not reported here. There is a concave age curve; white English

spouse); workers who own a home earn higher wages; and workers with more education earn
higher wages, ceteris paribus. Male workers with a child at home earn higher wages, whereas
female workers with a child earn lower wages, ceteris paribus.
First examining the location variables, Table 3 shows that among conspumas that lost
their protection quickly under NAFTA, those that appeared to be very vulnerable had substantially lower wage growth for married female high-school dropout workers than those with
low initial tariffs. In particular, married female workers with less than high school education
and an employed spouse, living in the most vulnerable conspuma with an initial local average
tariff of 4.74 percent, would see a substantial drop in wage growth over 1990s of around 18
percentage points. However, we do not find a similarly strong effect for married male workers with less than high school education, nor for workers with higher level of educational
attainment. Furthermore, among single workers of all educational attainment the effect on
wage growth is smaller and statistically insignificant, with no significant difference between
male and female workers.
Turning now to the industry effects, Table 3 shows a similarly asymmetric response of

10

wages of married female workers with less than high school education, with the effect for
married male workers being of smaller magnitude and imprecisely estimated. In particular,
married female high-school dropout workers with an employed spouse, working in the most
highly-protected industry with an initial tariff of 8.8 percent, would see wage growth 33
percentage points lower if it lost its protection right away than similar workers in an industry
that had no protection. Unlike the location effects, the effect of industry tariffs is statistically
significant for high-school dropout single workers. Again, the effect is much smaller for highschool graduates and those with some college, and negligible (and at times positive) for
college graduates.
To sum up the results so far, we find that: (1) There is no real difference between the
wage response of unmarried men and women. (2) There is a much more negative effect
on married women’s wages than married men’s wages, particularly for blue-collar workers
(in fact, most of the effect of NAFTA on blue-collar wages seems to be driven by married
women). (3) These effects hold true whether the worker’s spouse is working or not. Taken
together, we can call these results the finding of a married-woman differential. Explaining
this differential is our main goal.
To be sure that our results are not driven by the way we measure our dependent variable,
or how we select the sample of workers, we estimate the same regression replacing the
dependent variable with self-employment income for those with no wage income; replacing
the dependent variable with weekly wage; excluding workers over 55 years old; and excluding
workers with spouses younger than 25 and older than 64. The results reported in Appendix
Tables A1-A4 continue to be in line with the earlier findings in Table 3. We conclude that
our basic results are not driven by measurement error in dependent variable, or by sample
selection.3
3

We also take a closer look at possible fertility effects that could bias our basic estimates for women. To
address this, we split the sample of all female workers into those under 35 and over 35, and estimate separate
regressions for each group of workers (married with employed spouse, married with unemployed/NILF spouse,
and single). As reported in Appendix Table A5, we find similar wage responses among married women below
and over 35, with some differential responses among single women below and over 35. We conclude that the
fertility effects do not drive our basic results.

11

Before proceeding, we should underline some limitations in our exercise. First, since we
do not have panel data, but only two cross sections, we are unable to measure precisely
the effect of the tariff changes on the wage growth for a given worker, holding constant
the worker’s time-invariant unobservable characteristics. Some portion of the changes in
average wage reported in Table 3 may be due to changes in1 individual wages while some
portion results from changes in the composition of the demographic group in question due
to selection effects. In investigating possible explanations, these competing mechanisms will
be at the forefront of the discussion. Second, in order not to lose focus on our main agenda
of explaining the married-woman differential we are staying away from the related question
of measuring the effect of tariff changes on male-female wage gap.

3

Search for explanations

Below we investigate four different possible explanations for the results presented in previous
section.
(i) Heterogeneous occupations. It could be that different occupations have different levels
of sensitivity to industry-level trade shocks, for example because the cost of inter-industry
mobility differs across occupations. If women are over-represented in the more sensitive
occupations, that can lead to a larger wage effect on average for women workers than for
men.
(ii) Household bargaining. It could be that married women are less mobile than other
workers because switching industries sometimes requires switching city of residence, which
is a joint decision with her spouse. We investigate the possibility that if a husband has more
bargaining power than a wife, this can result in asymmetries in moving frictions that result
in larger wage impacts for married women than for single workers or married men. We will
show that simply assuming more bargaining power for husbands is inadequate to explain the
phenomena in the data, because asymmetric bargaining power within the household on its

12

own does not lead to asymmetries in worker mobility.
(iii) Household bargaining with non-linear preferences. We add to the household-bargaining
model to allow for non-linear interactions between consumption and locational preference,
so that the marginal utility of consumption is affected by the city in which the household
resides. We show that this can lead to effects of asymmetric bargaining power on worker
mobility, but it still is not sufficient to explain the correlations in the data.
(iv) Selective non-participation. It is possible that when an industry shrinks due to a
trade shock that a certain fraction of workers choose to leave the labor force. If those
leavers are disproportionally married women, and disproportionally the higher-paid workers
in their industry, the selection effect can result in a larger drop for average wage for the
remaining married women workers in the industry, compared to other groups. We present
an equilibrium model in which exactly this prediction emerges.

3.1
3.1.1

Heterogeneous occupations
Theory

Occupations vary greatly in the gender composition of their workers, with some occupations
dominated by woman workers and others by men. As one example, ‘textile sewing machine
operators,’ an occupation with more than a million workers in our dataset, has 10 female
workers for every male worker. If occupations also differ in the portability of skills across
industry, with some occupations very mobile across industries and others immobile, then it
could be that female-dominated occupations happen to be, on average, less mobile across
industries. This would imply a larger wage response to a trade shock for women workers on
average even if all genders are treated equally.
A simple example can illustrate the point. Suppose that there are two industries indexed
i = 1, 2 and two occupations indexed j = 1, 2. Production in each industry requires labor
input from both occupations, so output of industry i is given by a concave linear homogeneous
production function f i (Li1 , Li2 ), where Lij is the number of workers in occupation j employed
13

by industry i. Suppose that each worker is attached to an occupation and cannot change it.
To capture the idea that different occupations can have different degrees of mobility in a
simple way, suppose that workers in occupation 2 cannot change their industry of employment, but workers in occupation 1 can change their industry freely. Perhaps occupation 2
requires mastering a particular part of a production process with particular machines that
differ from one industry to another and so the skills required for it are not portable across
industries (sewing machines, for example, are not useful outside of the apparel industry);
while occupation 1 requires general production-floor activities that are similar across industries. Suppose that the price of output from both industries is given on world markets (for
simplicity, assume that the economy in question is a small open economy), but the domestic
price can differ from the world price due to trade policy. Letting good 2 be the numeraire,
suppose that industry 1 is import-competing, and its domestic price, p, is equal to the world
price plus an import tariff. All agents take all prices as given.4
Since occupation 1 is mobile, the wage w1 paid to it must be the same in both industries.
Since this will be equal to the marginal value product of labor, we have:

pf11 (L11 , L12 ) = w1 = f12 (L21 , L22 ) = f12 (L1 − L11 , L22 ),

(3.1)

where subscripts on a function indicate partial derivatives and L1 is the exogenous and fixed
supply of workers in occupation 1. This determines the allocation of occupation-1 workers
across the two industries, and also w1 . Further, the occupation-2 wages in the two industries
must adjust to yield zero profits in both industries:

4

c1 (w1 , w21 ) = p, and

(3.2)

c2 (w1 , w22 ) = 1,

(3.3)

This simple structure gives the model the same form as the Ricardo-Viner model of trade (Jones, 1971).

14

where ci (·) denotes the unit cost function for industry i and w2i is the occupation-2 wage in
industry i.
Differentiating (3.1) with respect to p, allowing L11 to adjust, shows that

dL11
dp

> 0, so a

reduction in the tariff on industry 1 will move labor from industry 1 to 2. This will reduce w1
(from the industry 2 first-order condition) and increase

w1
p

(from the industry-2 first-order

condition). If we write the elasticity of a variable X with respect to Y as XY , then this
implies:
0 < w1 p < 1.

(3.4)

Differentiating the two zero-profit conditions then implies that a drop in the tariff will
require a more-than-proportional drop in w21 to restore industry-1 zero profits, and an increase
in w22 to restore industry-2 zero profits:

w22 p < 0 < 1 < w21 p .

(3.5)

Conditions (3.4) and (3.5) together imply that the wage response for the immobile occupation in the import-competing industry will be much larger than for the mobile occupation.
If it so happens that women are concentrated in occupation 2 and men in occupation 1, then
a larger wage effect will be measured for women workers whose industry tariff is reduced
than for men. This is true even with industry and occupation fixed effects, because the fixed
effects will control for differences in the level of wage, not differences in the elasticity of wage
with respect to the tariff change. We can now ask whether or not this story is consistent
with the evidence.

3.1.2

Empirical test

To test whether the findings are driven by differential response of female-dominated occupations, we construct a dummy for female-dominated occupations and interact it with the
industry and local tariff variables. To identify female-dominated occupations, we compute

the ratio of women to men in each occupation in 1990. The ratio ranges from 0.01 (Bus, truck,
and stationary engine mechanics – a highly male-dominated occupation) to 101 (Secretaries
– a highly female-dominated occupation). Our dummy for female-dominated occupations
takes the value of 1 if this ratio is greater than five, in other words the number of women in
a given occupation is five times that of men in 1990, and zero otherwise.5 Table 4 lists all
such female-dominated occupations.
We add the dummy for female-dominated occupations to our main specification in equation (4) by interacting it with our industry and local tariff measures and year-2000 dummy.
The summary results are reported in Table 5 analogous to Table 3. It is clear that the results
are not affected in any substantive way after controlling for female-dominated occupations.
We conclude that the differential effects of NAFTA by gender are not caused by the different
occupational mixes shown by male and female workers.6

3.2
3.2.1

Household bargaining
Theory

We now consider the possibility that household bargaining, with asymmetric bargaining
power within the household, may be driving the results.
For illustration of the main points in the simplest way possible, consider a model with
two periods, two industries, and two towns. Suppose that industry 2 is the numeraire and
produces an export good, and industry 1 produces an import-competing good, whose world
price is P w , which is taken as given, while the domestic price is P = P w + t, where t is
an import tariff. All economic agents have the same homothetic utility function, which
5

The ranking of occupations by female-to-male ratio barely changes when we use our entire sample or
only 2000 Census.
6
In a separate set of regressions, in addition to female-dominated occupations we control for marriedwomen-dominated occupations. We construct a similar binary variable for occupations where the share
of married women exceeds 70 percent (in total number of women reporting a given occupation). This
share ranges from 40% (Baggage porters) to 87% (Farmers (owners and tenants)). The results reported in
Appendix Table A6 are qualitatively similar to those in Table 5, with one exception: net local tariff effect
for college graduate married women (with an employed spouse) is negative and statistically significant, and
of the same magnitude as that for high school dropouts.

the tariff. Each worker can produce either good i = 1, 2 in either town j = 1, 2; no other
factor than labor is required.7
Each worker z has an inherent ability az,i,j in industry i in town j. The worker’s ability
in a given industry is allowed to differ from one town to the next, which could occur because
the worker has social networks or previous business associates in particular locations that
allow him/her to find a more productive business arrangement than in other locations, even
within the same industry (there is strong evidence for the importance of local social networks
in finding employment; see Topa (2001)). We could think of the az,i,j as representing worker
z’s local “opportunities” in industry i in town j. Worker z’s real wage is then wz,i,j = pi az,i,j
7
This structure is of the type known as an ‘assignment model’ (Costinot and Vogel, 2015). It would be
much more realistic to assume that each industry produces with labor and at least one other factor, for
example, a specific factor which is in fixed and exogenous supply in each town. Specifically, each industry i
in each town j ∈ {1, 2} could have an endowment of a specific factor denoted K i,j . This would allow for the
two towns to have different employment patterns. Those features create complications that are not germane
to the point being made here, however, so we omit them.

18

if he or she works in industry i in town j.
In addition to the wage, each worker z expects a utility benefit z,j from being in city
j. This could be due to idiosyncratic tastes for climate, amenities, friends or enemies who
happen to live in each town. Both a worker’s ability in each industry and town, and that
worker’s preference for each town, are fixed for that worker’s lifetime, and the distribution of
these two traits across workers is independent. Suppose that the utility the worker receives
is a function v of consumption cz and amenity preferences z,j . For now, we assume a linear
relationship: v(cz , z,j ) = cz + z,j .
Now, suppose that during period 1, it is announced that the tariff t will be reduced,
lowering real price of output in industry 1, and hence lowering the real wage for every
worker employed in that industry. Workers in each industry have the option of switching
to the other industry and/or town at the end of period 1. If a worker switches, he/she will
receive the period-2 wage and idiosyncratic town utility benefit in the new industry/town
combination.8
Assume that the workers are composed in equal numbers of male and female, and that
some fraction are paired up in heterosexual marriages. The distribution of abilities and town
preferences is the same for each gender and also for married and single workers. We first
discuss the behavior of single workers, then married ones.
(i) Single workers. A worker with no family attachments will simply choose the industry
and city combination (i, j) in each period to maximize v(wz,i,j , z,j ), since for such a worker
consumption cz will be equal to the real wage.
When the tariff is reduced, some workers will leave industry 1. The workers who switch
industries will be those who, relative to the pool of incumbent industry-1 workers, ceteris
paribus have a relatively low comparative advantage in industry 1 (az,1,j − az,2,j ) and a taste
for a town in which their industry-2 opportunities are good (high z,j for a j with az,2,j big
8
The idiosyncratic abilities and town benefits will imply that only a fraction of workers will switch
industries or move following the trade shock. In this way, they act like switching costs or moving costs. A
full model would need to include direct costs of moving and switching industries, such as retraining and the
like. We omit those here for simplicity of exposition.

19

relative to az,1,j ). Some workers will change towns in order to switch industries; for example,
an industry-1 worker in town 1 might have az,2,2 much bigger than az,2,1 , and if z,2 is not too
much lower than z,1 , it will then be optimal to move to town 2 in order to switch industries.
We can characterize the adjustment as follows.
Proposition 1. The drop in the tariff causes a net movement of single workers out of
industry 1. In addition, the average productivity az,i,j of workers in industry 1 will rise.
As a result of the movements of workers out of industry 1, the drop in wages to industry-1
workers caused by the tariff reduction will be mitigated by a selection effect: The workers
who leave the industry are on average those who are less productive in industry 1 than the
average worker in the industry. This selection effect means that the average wage for single
workers in industry 1 will fall by less than the output price p1 .9
(ii) Married workers.
For simplicity, we assume that both partners in a marriage must live and work in the
same town; that all workers are employed in equilibrium, regardless of gender or marital
status; and that marriages do not either form or break up. Within each marriage, intrahousehold allocation issues are dealt with by bargaining, as for example in Browning et
al. (1994). Suppose that at the beginning of Period 1, each couple finds itself exogenously
located in one of the two towns,10 and must bargain to choose the town in which to live
and work in Period 1, and again bargain at the beginning of Period 2 after the policy
has been revealed.11 The threat point takes the form of continuing to live in the initial
town and each partner in the marriage consuming his/her real wage. Within a marriage
where in period 1 the husband worked in industry ih and the wife in iw , while both lived
9

If we had a richer model with a fixed factor in each industry, there would be a second mitigating effect:
The reduction in the labor supply to industry 1 would push up the marginal physical product of labor in that
industry, increasing the price of effective labor there, and so increasing the wage received by any industry-1
worker conditional on ability.
10
In a fuller model of dynamic adjustment, such as in Artuç and McLaren (2015), this initial allocation
would be determined endogenously as the pre-shock steady state.
11
We assume that the change in tariff at the start of Period 2 is a surprise, so does not factor into Period-1
bargaining.

20

in town j, the period-2 industry of employment of each spouse, i0h for the husband and
i0w for the wife; the consumption, c0h and c0w , and the city of residence, j 0 (which we recall
is the same for both partners in the marriage), are chosen to maximize the generalized

In an egalitarian marriage, µ = 21 .
Now, recalling that we are focused for the moment on the special case in which v(c, ) =
c + , the case of linear preferences, maximizing the Nash maximand can be broken into
two pieces: Choosing a common value for the town, j, together with an industry for each
spouse; and then choosing an allocation of consumption between the two subject to the
budget constraint created by that choice. The second choice amounts to choosing a pair of

values for the utility of the two spouses, (c0h + h,j , c0w + w,j ), which is a point on a straight

Any increase in wh,ih ,j + ww,iw ,j + h,j + w,j will shift this line upward, allowing for higher

Proposition 2. In each period, bargaining within a marriage results in a common value of
j 0 and an industry pair i0h and i0w that maximizes:

(3.6)

It is worth pointing out that we can see here why it matters that the idiosyncratic
abilities az,i,j in general vary by town and not only by industry. In the special case in which
a worker’s productivity in a given industry does not depend on the town in which he/she is
employed, so that az,i,j ≡ az,i , maximization of (3.6) is separable in the town and industry
0

decisions. The couple can choose the town that maximizes the sum of their z,j preference
terms, and within that town choose the industries that maximize their incomes. Since this

21

choice of industry is no different from what a single worker would do, we conclude that there
would be no difference in the response of industry employment shares or in the behavior of
average productivities in either industry, or therefore, in wages, as a result of the trade shock,
between married and single workers, or between workers of either gender. Our data reject
that possibility, so we proceed with the assumption that workers’ abilities across industries
are not perfectly correlated across towns.
A full analysis of the equilibrium response to a reduction in the tariff is beyond our
scope, but it is easy to see how marriage can make a worker less responsive to trade shocks
that affect her industry. Consider a single worker who is initially in industry-town cell (1, 1)
and who following the tariff reduction would switch to (2, 2). If that same worker had been
married to a worker with a strong enough preference for town 1, the couple would remain
in that location and the worker in question would choose between industry 1 and 2 in that
town. If her ability in industry 2 in town 1 happens to be weak, it will be optimal to
remain in (1, 1). Put differently, a single worker will choose industry and town to maximize

h,j + w,j . A change in a worker’s wage matters half as much at the margin

for the decision in a marriage compared to the decision for a single worker.
Consider the implications for equilibrium wages, as determined by the labor-supply effect
and the selection effect discussed above. If it is true that fewer married women leave industry
1 following the trade shock than single women do, the selection effect analyzed in Proposition
1 will be weaker for married women than for single one. In that case, the industry-1 wage
will fall more for married women than for single women in industry 1.
However, because the criterion for moving is simply the sum of the two spouses’ payoffs,
the selection effect will be exactly the same for husbands as for wives. Consequently, this
specification for the bargaining model is rejected by the data: It can rationalize a larger wage
effect of the tariff reduction for married industry-2 workers than for unmarried workers, but
it cannot rationalize the much larger effect for married women than for married men. We

22

should also note that in this special case, the bargaining parameter µ has no effect on worker
mobility or on wages at all. It affects the within-household allocation of consumption, but
it does not affect decisions on switching industries or moving from one town to another.
We now investigate whether or not this theory is consistent with the data.

3.2.2

Empirical test

A key point to note is that in our simple model, no matter how strong the asymmetry in
bargaining power within a marriage, the effect of tariff changes on wages of married men
and women should be symmetric. Because the criterion (3.6) for moving is simply the sum
of the two spouses’ payoffs, the selection effect will be exactly the same for husbands as for
wives. Thus, the theory can rationalize a larger wage effect of the tariff reduction for married
industry-1 workers than for unmarried workers, but it cannot rationalize a larger effect for
married women than for married men. We should also note that in this special case, the
bargaining parameter µ has no effect on worker mobility or on wages at all. It affects the
within-household allocation of consumption, but it does not affect decisions on switching
industries or moving from one town to another.
However, as seen in Tables 3 and 5 the wage responses of married men and women to
the NAFTA shock are not symmetric. This asymmetry is not restricted to wages only but
is extended to the migration behavior of married men and women as well, as reported in
Table 6. We run a set of regressions for each worker group where the dependent variable is
the change in the log labor force of educational class k, either employed or unemployed, in
conspuma c between 1990 and 2000. We regress this on the initial local tariff and change in
local tariff to see if movements in workers of various groups are driven to a significant degree
by the NAFTA shock.
Focusing on high-school dropouts, the main message is that a conspuma with a high
level of protection that lost it by 2000 tended to lose more high-school dropout women than
men over the 1990s relative to other conspumas. In particular, for married women with an

23

employed spouse this loss amounted to −27.91 + 17.96 = −9.95 percent, significant at the
1% level, as opposed to married men with an employed spouse for which the loss was −8.27
percent. For single high school dropout women, this loss amounts to −8.97, whereas the
share of similar single men increased by 1.1 percent, although not significantly different from
zero.12

3.3

Household bargaining with non-linear preferences

3.3.1

Theory

The previous section showed that household bargaining with asymmetric bargaining power is
not sufficient to match to match the married-woman differential„ because in the model with
linear utility asymmetric bargaining power does not lead to asymmetric industry-switching
behavior. However, this changes if we allow for non-linear preferences.
For a simple example, let v(c, ) = c. In this specification, a member of the household
will enjoy consumption spending more while located in a town that he or she enjoys.
To see how bargaining-power asymmetry can create asymmetries in mobility in this
model, it is helpful to consider the limiting case in which the husband has all of the bargaining power (that is, the limit as µ → 0). In this case, the outcome will keep the wife at her
threat-point utility, which is v(ww,iw ,j , w,j ) = ww,iw ,j w,j . If the outcome of the bargaining
leads the couple to settle in town j 0 , this level of utility will require the wife’s consumption
to be

the amount of consumption left over for the husband, and so the utility the husband obtains

(3.7)

These effects are to some extent the result of high-school dropout married women leaving the labor force
which we explore further below in Section 3.4. Repeating the regression with the log change in working-age
population for each educational class and group of workers instead of the labor force provides similar effects
with smaller magnitudes (Appendix Table A7). However, the difference between initial tariff and change
in tariff is now -7.15 and -4.98 for married high school dropout men and women with an employed spouse,
respectively, also significant at the 1% level.

Bargaining, then, results in the locational outcome that maximizes (3.7).
Clearly the husband’s and wife’s wages do not enter symmetrically, as was the case in
Section (ii) above. The wife’s initial-industry wage ww,iw ,j has a unique role, in determining
the strength of the wife’s threat point. For a couple in which the wife is initially in industry
1, a reduction in the tariff lowers ww,iw ,j ; aside from the direct effect that the changes in real
wages have for the two spouses in the different work options, this effect indirectly increases
the payoff to the husband in all options, because it lowers the amount of consumption he
has to give up to the wife. However, the effect is the largest for choices in a town j 0 which
0

the husband likes more than the wife (that is, has a high value of

h,j
0 ).
w,j

As a result, the way

the bargaining power works, a tariff reduction is more likely to result in a selection of town
that the husband enjoys, relative to the status quo with no tariff reduction. Importantly,
there is no corresponding role for the husband’s initial-industry wage, wh,i,j , in the allocation
decision.
Of course, in the limit as µ approaches 0, the roles will reverse, and there will be husbands trapped by wives’ town preferences. The point is that with non-linear preferences,
town-dependent opportunities, and asymmetric bargaining power from treating µ as a free
parameter, we can rationalize both different switching behavior between married and unmarried workers in response to a common trade shock, and different moving behavior for
married male and female workers in response to a common trade shock. Further, this can
rationalize different wage responses for married women, since different switching behavior
implies different degrees of strength for the selection effect that was formalized in Proposition
1. Now we turn to the question of whether this richer story fits the data or not.

3.3.2

Empirical test

To test this theory, we run a set of regressions where the dependent variable is the share
of employed married (or single) women (or men) of educational class k in each industry j
and conspuma c in total labor force or working age population of conspuma c between 1990

26

and 2000. Our regressors include industry- and location-specific initial tariffs and change in
tariffs. According to this version of the household-bargaining theory, the employed married
women’s share in each industry/conspuma should rise when hit by a trade shock since other
groups are leaving the industry/conspuma but at least a fraction of the married women
cannot leave. However, as reported in Table 7, we find exactly the opposite.
Focusing on high-school dropouts, a conspuma with a high level of protection that lost it
by 2000 tended to lose both more married women and men employed in an average industry
than single workers over the 1990s relative to other conspumas. In particular, for married
women this loss amounted to −0.611 + 0.382 = −0.229 percentage points, and for married
men −0.25 percentage points. For single high school dropout women and men, this loss
amounted to −0.111 and −0.006 percentage points, respectively.
We conclude that household bargaining with asymmetric bargaining power and non-linear
preferences cannot explain the married-woman differential any more than the linear model
could.

3.4.1

Selective non-participation
Theory

Some studies, such as Autor et al. (2013) and Sauré and Zoabi (2014), have found evidence
of workers withdrawing from the labor force in response to a loss of tariff protection. We
argue here that under some conditions selection decisions by some women to withdraw from
the labor market in response to a trade shock hitting their industry could produce magnified
wage responses for married women compared to other workers. The way this could happen
is as follows.
Suppose that single workers have no option to stay out of the labor market, and suppose
that cultural norms prevent a married man from doing so except in case of disability or
retirement age (this will of course depend on the time and place and local culture, but is
probably a reasonable assumption to impose for our data period). Under these assumptions,

the only group of workers with an option to leave the labor market is married women.
Suppose that a married woman will choose to remain in the labor market if her wage is
high enough or her husband’s wage is low enough; then if an import-competing industry is
hit with a trade shock that lowers wages for all workers in the industry, a certain fraction
of the married women will respond by leaving the labor market. Now, if those women are
the most productive women in that industry, their departure will lead to a selection effect
that will magnify the effect on average wages of married women still in the industry. This
is exactly what will happen if two conditions are satisfied: (i) The departing women have
higher-income spouses – as they will tend to do because only a worker with a sufficiently
highly-paid spouse can afford to leave the labor market. (ii) Partners in marriage with
highly-paid spouses tend to be highly-paid themselves, since the marriage market features
positive assortative matching. These two features together tend to lead to the departing
women being higher-wage workers than the ones they leave behind, pushing average wages
down beyond the effect of the initial trade shock.13
We can formalize a simple model as follows. Suppose that unmarried workers simply
consume their own wages, but married workers share their earnings. Suppose that all married
couples have the same utility function, an increasing, concave, twice-differentiable function
U (·), which is a function of the couple’s combined real wage. If a married couple have a
wife whose real wage is ww and the husband’s real wage is wh , and if they both work, their
utility is U (ww + wh ). On the other hand, if the wife chooses not to work, their utility is
U (wh ) + F , where F > 0 is extra utility they share from the wife’s extra time for non-market
activities, a parameter that is the same for all households. If U (ww + wh ) − U (wh ) ≥ F ,
the wife will work, and otherwise she will leave the labor market. (For all workers, for the
moment assume that there is no other alternative employment; there is only one choice, and
that is to be in or out of the labor force for married women.)
13
Note that the effects we find empirically are all within an educational class, since we control for education.
Consequently, the theory should be interpreted as one in which higher-wage women within their educational
class withdraw from the labor market in response to a trade shock.

30

Clearly, for a given wh , a married woman worker will remain in the labor market if and
only if ww is above a given threshold. Denoting that threshold as w̃w (wh ), and taking the
derivative of U (w̃w (wh ) + wh ) − U (wh ) = F with respect to wh , we obtain:
dw̃w
U 0 (wh ) − U 0 (w̃w (wh ) + wh )
> 0.
=
dwh
U 0 (w̃w (wh ) + wh )

(3.8)

Therefore, we can draw a figure with ww on the horizontal axis and wh on the vertical
axis, with an upward-sloping curve representing the threshold between the region in which
the woman worker stays in and leaves the labor force. This curve is represented in Figure
3.1, which measures the wife’s real wage on the horizontal axis and the husband’s on the
vertical axis. Any point in the figure to the right of the curve represents a couple for whom
the wife’s wage is high enough and the husband’s wage is low enough that the wife remains
in the labor market. Any point to the left of the curve represents a couple for whom the wife
will leave the labor market. An assumption on the curvature of U allows us to characterize
the shape of the curve:
Proposition 3. If the coefficient of relative risk aversion associated with U is everywhere
greater than 1, then the curve defined by U (w̃w (wh ) + wh ) − U (wh ) = F goes through the
origin. Further, any ray through the origin that intersects the curve will intersect it from
below, and only once.
The implication of Proposition 3 is that, if relative risk aversion exceeds 1, other things
equal, a woman will be more likely to work, the higher is her wage (the farther to the right
is the couple in the diagram), and the lower is her husband’s wage (the farther down is the
couple in the diagram).
To fill in the rest of the model, suppose that there are many industries, one of which
is the import-competing industry 1, initially protected by a tariff. The price of industry-1
output is denoted p. We wish to compare outcomes before and after a trade shock. To
make the analysis as simple as possible, consider a two-period model, and suppose that in
31

Figure 3.1:

Period 1 workers select their industries, and a fraction λ of male and female workers choose
a spouse and marry, expecting the same trade policy to prevail in Period 2. Importantly,
for this discussion, λ is an exogenous constant. We discuss the important question of how
the marriage rate may respond to trade policy, and how that may affect the married-woman
differential, in the next section. In Period 2, all agents are surprised by a change in trade
policy that lowers the value of p. Workers are unable to change their choice of industry or
spouse in Period 2. Denote the initial-equilibrium value for the industry-i output price by
pi and the Period-2 value by p̃i .
Each worker z has ability level az,i in industry i, which is a constant for each worker. The
distribution of az,i values is the same for male and female, married and unmarried workers.
The wage received by worker z in industry i is wz = az,i pi , so each worker z will have a wage
given by wz = maxi {az,i pi }.
Now, suppose that a randomly selected fraction λ of male and female workers marry in
Period 1, sorting according to positive assortative matching. Given the symmetry of the
model, this implies that within each marriage the male wage and the female wage are equal.
32

Figure 3.2:

As a result, every married couple will occupy a point along the 45o line, portrayed as the
solid ray, in Figure 3.2. Some fraction will have the husband and the wife both in industry
1; some will have husband in 1 and wife in 2, and so on; and some fraction will be located
above the curve so that the wife leaves the labor market. The range of wages for this subset
of married woman workers in industry 1 is given by ac.
Now, consider a married couple with the wife in industry 1 and the husband in some
other industry. When the Period 2 shock arrives, since p1 will fall to p̃1 , the ray showing
the wage pairs for this subset of married couples will rotate as shown in the broken ray in
Figure 3.2. Consequently, a fraction of the women in this set will leave the labor market,
and only ab will remain. Since the portion of workers who remain in industry 1 will see a
wage reduction of

p1 −p̃1
,
p1

and the portion who leave the labor market, bc, are at the higher

end of the wage distribution, the average wage for married women workers in this industry
will fall by more than

p1 −p̃1
.
p1

On the other hand, a couple with both members in industry 1 will see both wages fall

33

proportionally, a move down and to the left along the solid ray in Figure 3.2. If both spouses
were initially in the labor market, they will continue to be so after the shock. Consequently,
average wages for married women in this category will fall by

p1 −p̃1
,
p1

the same as unmarried

workers or married male workers.
This can all be summarized as follows.
Proposition 4. Assume that the coefficient of relative risk aversion associated with U is
everywhere greater than 1. Then as a result of the trade shock, the wages of all workers
in industry 1 fall in the same proportion, except for married women whose husband is in a
different industry. Their average wage in industry 1 falls by more than the other groups, and
their share of employment in industry 1 falls.

3.4.2

Empirical test

To see if this theory is consistent with the data, we first look at some basic correlations
implied by the model. Specifically, we ask (i) whether our data exhibit positive assortative
matching, and (ii) whether, as implied by Proposition 3 (combined with relative risk aversion
greater than unity), a higher husband’s wage lowers the probability that a married woman
will stay in the labor force. To test these hypotheses we need a model that deals with the
sample-selection issue raised by the fact that the wage of a worker who has left the labor
force is not observed.14
Suppose that each woman worker i has a latent wage wi∗ . This is a function of the worker’s
personal, industry, geographic, and occupational characteristics Xi including potentially the
husband’s wage because of positive assortative matching:

wi∗ = Xi β + i .

(3.9)

The wage is observed if and only if the worker chooses to be in the labor force. This
14

We have last year’s wages for workers who are not currently in the labor force but who were employed
last year. We do not use those wages here.

34

occurs if:

wi∗ ≥ Zi β + ηi .

(3.10)

The Zi should in principle could contain all of the variables in Xi plus some variables
that plausibly affect the decision to be in the workforce but not the wage conditional on
being in the labor force, such as cultural factors, family information and home ownership.
Assume that ηi is distributed as N (0, 1) and i is distributed as N (0, σ), with a correlation
of ρ between the two. We restrict the sample to married woman workers whose husbands
work at least 35 hours per week and report positive wages, and estimate these two equations
together using the Heckman two-step procedure.
The results are reported in Table 9. The first column shows the results for equation (3.10).
This equation contains standard demographic and educational variables, plus a dummy for
home ownership (as a proxy for wealth), for presence of a school-aged child (which can raise
the opportunity cost of going into the workforce), and for immigrant status, which may
be correlated with cultural views on female labor-force participation. These last three are
omitted from the second column, which shows the results for equation (3.9). The second-tolast row of the table shows the estimate of λ ≡ σρ. One important note to make is that, as in
all of our wage regressions, the specification of equation (3.9) includes conspuma dummies,
which are (as always) suppressed in the table, but equation (3.10) does not have conspuma
dummies since a probit is inconsistent as the number of fixed effects becomes large, and the
estimation does not converge in our case.
Controlling for all other observables, a woman worker in our data is less likely to be in the
labor force if she has less than a college education, if she has a school-age child at home, and
if she is an immigrant. A small surprise is the positive coefficient on home ownership; one
might have expected this to have a negative sign, if it proxies for higher household wealth.
Other things equal, the probability of being in the labor force peaks at age 45, while the
wage takes a minimum at that age.

The main coefficients for our purposes are in the first row. Ceteris paribus, a higher
husband’s wage implies a higher wage for the woman worker, which is evidence of positive
assortative matching (item (i) above). In addition, ceteris paribus, a higher husband’s wage
is correlated with a lower probability of being in the labor force, which is in line with
Proposition 3 (item (ii) above). Both of these findings hold with a high degree of statistical
significance.
Having checked for the basic correlations implied by the model, we turn now to testing
the main predictions of the theory. First, we test the prediction of Proposition 4, that

some fraction of married women choose not to participate in the labor force in response
to a trade shock, in two ways. The first is to estimate a linear probability model of labor
force participation where the dependent variable is a dummy that takes a value of 1 if the
individual is in the labor force and zero otherwise. The second test examines a subsample of
married men and women where both spouses are employed in the same or different industries.
According to our theory, for those couples that work in the same industry there would be no
effect on labor force participation, and the effect of the trade shock on wife’s and husband’s
wages would be the same, because if the husband is hit with the same wage shock as the
wife, the couple cannot afford to lose her income.
Table 10 reports the results from a linear probability model of labor force participation
for each of six groups of workers. The right-hand-side variables are the same as in the wage
regression, and the results are arranged in the same way as in Table 3. The coefficients for
location effects are negative for all groups of workers at almost all educational levels, with
the effects being larger for both married and single women and decreasing in the level of
educational attainment. This implies that, for example, high-school dropout female workers

in a location that had high protection and lost it by 2000 are less likely to be in the labor
force by 2000. The industry effects are less strong and imprecisely measured, but the overall
story is the same in that women are more likely to drop out of labor force than men in
highly-protected industries that lost their protection by 2000. The overall message of Table
10 is that NAFTA-driven tariff reductions did disproportionately push female workers, both
married and single, out of the labor force in the hardest-hit communities.
Another implication of the marriage market/selection model is that among married couples, controlling for all other factors, wages should fall for women workers when their own
industry tariff falls but should rise when their husband’s industry tariff falls, since if the husband’s tariff falls, the woman worker is more likely to remain in the labor force, and under
conditions of Proposition 3 this will raise the average productivity of working women in her
industry. Table 11 examines this prediction. This is a wage regression for the married women
in the sample with employed husbands, with all of the controls of earlier regressions and the
same format, except that we control not only for the woman worker’s industry tariff but
also for her husband’s industry tariff. (The locational tariffs are the same for both spouses.)
Recalling our basic estimating equation (2.2), this creates a large number of interactions,
which prove to be too many to estimate, so we collapse the four educational categories to
two, ‘Less educated’ (high-school or below) and ‘Highly educated’ (some college or college
graduate).
38

The first four rows of Table 11 show results in line with the main specification as in Table
3; a married woman worker’s wage falls when her town’s average tariff or her industry’s
tariff falls. The last two lines show the effect of the husband’s industry tariff, and these are
in line with the prediction of the selection model: A drop in the husband’s industry tariff
increases the wife’s expected wage, with high statistical significance. It is difficult to imagine
a mechanism by which this finding could be rationalized except through the sort of selection
mechanism we have sketched here.
Finally, recall that according to the labor-force-participation model, if both spouses are
in the same industry, a drop in the tariff should have no effect on the wife’s participation
decision, while if they are in different industries, a drop in the wife’s industry tariff will make
her more likely to leave the labor force. To test this hypothesis, we next limit our sample
to married individuals with both spouses being employed, and run separate wage and labor
force participation regressions for spouses employed in the same and different industries.
Although the sample size for the former type of couples (employed in the same industry) is
small and the estimates are imprecisely measured, we do find support for our theory (Table
12). In particular, there is no distinguishable difference in labor force participation response
of men and women when both spouses are employed in the same industry (columns 5 and 6);
for this group, the labor-force participation effects are mostly small and insignificant. The
earlier differential results across men and women are completely driven by women that are
employed in a different industry then their spouse.
The main elements of the selective non-participation story are therefore consistent with
the data. However, we should note that this theory does not provide a full explanation.
Table 12 shows that even for couples with both spouses employed in the same industry,
the effect of industry tariff reductions on the wife’s wage (−4.326) is negative, statistically
significant, and much larger than the statistically insignificant effect on the husband’s wage
(0.207). This would not be the case if our selective non-participation story was the sole force
driving the results.

Endogenous marriage

To this point, we have assumed that the decision to marry or to remain married does not
itself respond to changes in trade policy. This is obviously not a safe assumption, and if the
marriage decision is affected by trade policy the married-woman differential could be a mix of
a change in the pool of married woman workers (which we have ignored so far) together with
changes in individual workers’ wages and changes in the labor force participation (which
were the subject of the previous section). If we had panel data, we could separate these
effects cleanly, measuring the effect of a tariff change on a worker conditional on initial
marital status, holding fixed unobserved time-invariant personal characteristics, but with
our repeated cross sections we are unable to do so. Therefore, although the possible effect of
NAFTA on marriage is outside of our focus in this paper, the topic needs to be addressed.
Indeed, Autor et al. (2017) present evidence that increases in manufactured imports
from China have had a strong influence on marriage rates and the marriage market. Autor
et al. (2017) show that locations in the US that saw a larger China import shock (because

40

they had larger employment shares in industries that saw large increases in imports from
China) saw substantial reductions in the income of male workers relative to female workers.
These changes were correlated with a drop in the fraction of workers who were married.
This is interpreted in terms of a model in which women are reluctant to marry a man who
is likely to have low income relative to the woman’s income, an assumption that has broad
empirical support in the literature on the economics of the family, and which we can call the
‘relative-income hypothesis.’ Because of this hypothesis, a shock to the labor market that
lowers men’s incomes relative to women’s will tend to reduce the number of marriages in
equilibrium.
To explore whether or not this sort of mechanism could possibly help explain the marriedwoman differential finding that is our focus, consider the following stylized model of the
marriage market, based on an extremely simplified version of the relative-income hypothesis.15 Suppose that a given local labor market has a unit endowment of male workers and a
unit endowment of female workers. Two industries produce with Ricardian technology. For
cultural reasons, men all work in industry 1 and women in industry 2. This stark assumption
allows for the lowering of tariffs to have a differential effect on the two genders’ incomes,
which Autor et al. (2017) show to be important in the case of the China shock. Each
worker z has a productivity az in his or her industry. These productivities have a uniform
distribution on [amin , amax ]. Industry 2 is the numeraire sector, and industry 1 output has
a domestic output price given by p. Therefore, a man’s income will be given by paz and a
woman’s income by az . We close down the mechanism discussed in the previous sub-section
by supposing that non-participation in the labor market is not an option for any worker.
Each worker wishes to marry a worker of the opposite sex, but a woman will refuse a
match with a man whose income is not at least equal to κ > 1 times her own; if no potential
spouse is available who satisfies that constraint, she will prefer to remain unmarried. This
15

Autor et al. (2017) present a model in which childbearing has a central role, but we omit such considerations because they are not essential to make the point about wage movements that is our interest
here.

41

is a crude way of adding the relative-income hypothesis into the analysis, but it suffices
for our purposes. Aside from this constraint, each worker will prefer a spouse with a higher
income to one with a lower income. If p ≥ κ, every worker will marry and positive assortative
matching will apply, so in order to allow for a non-trivial outcome, assume that p < κ. In this
case, the highest-income male worker (with income equal to pamax ) will be unacceptable to
the highest-income female worker (with income equal to amax ), so she will choose to remain
unmarried. The highest-income female worker to marry will have az = pamax /κ, and will
marry the highest-income male worker. If male and female workers match assortatively this
implies that the lowest-income female worker will marry a male worker with productivity

. If the inequality

(4.1)

holds, then it is easy to confirm that this marginal male worker’s income exceeds κ times
the income of the lowest-income female worker, so this is an equilibrium.16
In equilibrium, then, (i) the most productive female workers in their industry remain
unmarried; (ii) the least productive men in their industry remain unmarried; (iii) the fraction
of both groups who remain unmarried is equal to:

(4.2)

which is a decreasing function of p. As a result, if industry 1 is import-competing so that
lowering tariffs result in a drop in p, male worker incomes will fall relative to female worker
incomes, resulting in a decline in marriage rates in this local labor market (all as described
in Autor et al. (2017)). More subtly, the pool of married female workers will become
less productive, because the marginal women choosing to switch to unmarried status would

If the stated inequality does not hold, the equilibrium is qualitatively the same but the lowest-income
female worker is indifferent between remaining unmarried and marrying the marginal male worker.

42

have been the most productive married women workers; but the pool of unmarried women
workers will also become less productive, because those marginal women will now be the
least productive unmarried women workers. The opposite effects will hold for married and
unmarried male workers. To summarize:
Proposition 5. In this model of endogenous marriage rates, a reduction in the importcompeting price p causes: (i) A shift to the left in the distribution of incomes of men relative
to women. (ii) A reduction in marriage rates, with a drop in the productivity cutoff above
which women remain unmarried and an increase in the productivity cutoff below which men
remain unmarried. (iii) A reduction in the average productivity and average wage of married
woman workers and also of unmarried woman workers. (iv) An increase in productivity of
married men and also of unmarried men, and so a reduction in the average wage for each of
those two groups that is smaller than the drop in p.
It is conceivable that this mechanism in and of itself could give rise to a married-woman
differential, but it is by no means clear that the drop in married-woman wages will exceed the
drop in unmarried-woman wages. However, for this to be the driver of the married-woman
differential, a number of other predictions must hold, including (i) falling male incomes
relative to female incomes in response to falling local average tariffs; (ii) falling marriage
rates in response to falling local average tariffs; (iii) relative effects for unmarried wages, and
(iv) relative effects for male wages. We address these in turn.

4.1

Male incomes relative to female incomes

A straightforward way of measuring a shift in the distribution of male incomes relative
to female incomes is a quantile regression. Table 13 reports the results of conspuma-level
regressions to study this question.17 In the first three columns the dependent variable is the
first difference in the x-percentile male wage in a conspuma minus the x-percentile female
17

This table is analogous to Table 3 of Autor et al. (2017), which is a much simpler version of a quantile
regression studied by Chetverikov et al. (2016).

43

wage in the same conspuma, for x = 25%, 50%, or 75% (the first difference is measured
between 2000 and 1990). In these calculations the wages of all working-age persons are
included, including people with zero wage and people who are not in the labor force. The
regressors are the initial local average tariff in 1990 and the change in the local average tariff
between the two years. The ’Overall effect’ is the difference between the two coefficients and
measures the expected change in the dependent variable per unit of tariff for a conspuma
that lost all of its tariff protection by 2000. These effects are all positive and significant. For
example, a one-standard-deviation increase in the initial local average tariff, if the tariff went
to zero by 2000, would increase the 25th percentile male wage relative to the 25th -percentile
female wage by 0.67% × $40, 188, or about $270. For the last three columns the dependent
variable is the difference in male and female wage quantiles as a percentage of the male
wage. The effect is again positive, but significant only for the higher wage quantiles. For
the 25th percentile, the point estimate implies that a one-standard-deviation higher local
average tariff eliminated by 2000 would be associated with a 0.67% × 264 = 1.8 percentagepoint increase in the male-female wage differential. The effects for higher quartiles are much
smaller.

Notes: Standard errors are clustered by state. Regressions are weighted by working age population of conspuma in 1990.
Additional controls include 1990 shares of conspuma population that are white, college educated, and fraction of employed
women, as well as border dummy. The number of observations is different in column 4 because 25th percentile male wage
in three conspumas was zero in 1990.

The conclusion of this table is that local-average tariff reductions due to NAFTA were
not correlated with large changes in the local wages of men relative to women, and to the
extent that there was any change it was a small increase in the relative wages of men.
This appears to be a major contrast with the later China shock, and conceivably the reason
could be the NAFTA-induced relative decline in married women’s labor market participation
discussed above. Therefore, the first element of the endogenous-marriage-rate explanation
for the married-woman differential is not present.

4.2

Marriage rates

The next prediction to check is that marriage rates fell in local labor markets that lost
protection relative to others. This is evaluated in Table 14, which is constructed as in the
previous table except with a dependent variable that is a measure of the marriage rate
in the conspuma. The marriage rate in a conspuma can be computed in different ways;
the numerator in these regressions is either the number of married persons in the working

45

age population, among the employed, or among the labor force; and the denominator is
either the total number of persons employed or the size of the labor force. Computed in
any of these ways, the result is a small positive net effect, in most cases not significant.
For example, from the specification with the rate computed as the number married in the
working age population divided by the total labor force (second column), the effect of a
one-standard-deviation increase in the local average tariff that is eliminated by 2000 is a rise
in the marriage rate equal to 0.67% × 0.911 = 0.61%, or less than a one-percentage-point
increase in the marriage rate.

Notes: Standard errors are clustered by state. Regressions are weighted by working age population of conspuma in 1990.

The conclusion of this table is that local-average tariff reductions due to NAFTA were
not correlated with large changes in local marriage rates, and to the extent that there was
any change it was a small increase in marriage rates. Again, this appears to be a contrast
with the experience of the China shock, and therefore, the second element of the endogenousmarriage-rate explanation for the married-woman differential is not present.

4.3

Relative wages of other demographic groups.

Recall from Proposition 5 that under this endogenous marriage-rate model, a larger drop
in local average tariff would be associated with a drop in the average wage for unmarried
46

workers relative to their average wage in other conspumas. However, we already know that
this is not found in the data. The first four lines of the last column of Table 3 show us that
there is no statistically-significant difference in the growth of average wages for unmarried
women workers in conspumas that lost a lot of protection compared to others.
We conclude that although marriage rates should assuredly be viewed as endogenous,
and in principle they could affect the wage response of married women in ways similar to
the results we observe, it is unlikely that endogenous marriage rates are the explanation for
the married-woman differential that we have observed in the data.

5

Conclusion

We have documented a sharp difference in labor-market response to NAFTA across gender
and marital status: The largest effects of NAFTA, by far, are shown in the wages of married
women workers whose industry of employment lost its tariff. We have shown that this cannot
be explained by the different occupation mix of male and female workers, or by household
bargaining in which husbands with disproportionate bargaining power within the household
prevent their wives from adjusting to shocks as they otherwise would wish to do. In addition,
the patterns in the data cannot be explained by marriage rates that respond to changes in
tariffs. We do find some support for an interpretation based on selective non-participation,
in which some married women workers adjust to a trade shock by leaving the labor market;
under this interpretation, because of positive assortative matching in the marriage market,
the ones who do so tend to be the women with higher wages. However, this does not account
for all of the features of the data, so we are left with a puzzle.

Appendix
Proof of Proposition 1.
Proof. For a given worker z, fix z,j , j = 1, 2, and az,i,j for i 6= 1. The optimal choice will be
industry 1 in town 1 if and only if p1 az,1,1 + z,1 ≥ max{p1 az,1,2 + z,2 , p2 az,2,1 + z,1 , p2 az,2,2 +
z,2 }. Consider the case in which p2 az,2,1 + z,1 ≥ p2 az,2,2 + z,2 . Then the condition for
choosing (1, 1) reduces to:
a

z,1,1

≥a

z,1,2

z,2 − z,1
and
+
p1

az,1,1 ≥

p2 z,2,1
a
.
p1

(5.1)

(5.2)

The condition for choosing (1, 2) analogously becomes:

az,1,1 ≤ az,1,2 +

az,1,2 ≥

z,2 − z,1
and
p1

(5.3)

p2 z,2,1
a
.
p1

(5.4)

The condition for choosing industry 1 is then the condition that (5.1) and (5.2) or (5.3)
and (5.4) hold. This reduces to (5.2) or (5.4). These together create a region of the form
of Figure 1A. The integral of the density for az,1,1 and az,1,2 above that boundary gives the
fraction of single workers who choose industry 1, conditional on those values of z,j , j = 1, 2,
and az,i,j for i 6= 1.
Now, note that a reduction in the tariff, by reducing p1 and increasing p2 , shifts the
boundary up and to the right, reducing the fraction of these workers who choose industry
1. For these workers as well, since the bottom boundary of the region is being trimmed
away, the average productivities for workers who remain above the boundary has risen. All
of this was conditional on the case p2 az,2,1 + z,1 ≥ p2 az,2,2 + z,2 , but a parallel argument

51

Figure 1A

constructed for the contrary case produces the same conclusions. Therefore, conditional on
z,j , j = 1, 2, and az,i,j for i 6= 1, a reduction in the tariff reduces the fraction of single
workers who choose industry 1, and increases the average productivity of those who remain
in industry 1. Integrating of all values of z,j , j = 1, 2, and az,i,j for i 6= 1 then establishes
the proposition.
Proof of Proposition 3.
Proof. For values of ww and wh along a ray through the origin, U (ww + wh ) − U (wh ) can be
written as U (y) − U (κy), with κ ∈ (0, 1) a constant. For the proposition, it is sufficient to
show that this function is a decreasing function of y. First:
d
[U (y) − U (κy)] = U 0 (y) − κU 0 (κy).
dy

(5.5)

This derivative is negative if and only if U 0 (y) < κU 0 (κy). For this, it is sufficient that

52

κU 0 (κy) be a decreasing function of κ (since κ < 1). Note:
d
[κU 0 (κy)] = U 0 (κy) + U 00 (κy)κy.
dκ

(5.6)

This is negative if and only if
U 00 (κy)κy
< −1,
U 0 (κy)
which is the stated condition.
