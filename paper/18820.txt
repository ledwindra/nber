ABSTRACT
We investigate whether the first digit of an odometer reading is more salient to consumers than subsequent
digits. We find that retail transaction prices and volumes of used vehicles drop discontinuously at 10,000-mile
odometer thresholds, echoing effects found in the wholesale market by Lacetera, Pope and Sydnor
(2012). Our results reveal that retail consumers devote limited attention to evaluating vehicle mileage,
and that this drives effects in the wholesale market. We estimate the inattention parameter implied
by the price discontinuities. In addition, our results suggest that estimating consumer-level structural
parameters using data from an intermediate market can give misleading results.

Introduction
Modern economic life requires individuals to evaluate many pieces of decision-relevant
information every day. A growing body of evidence shows that not all information is equally
salient to consumers.1 This is the case even for large-scale purchases made in well-functioning
markets such as the market for automobiles, as shown by Lacetera, Pope, and Sydnor (2012). In
this paper, we study how the effects of information salience propagate through markets,
specifically between retail and wholesale markets, by examining the effect of “left-digit bias” on
the valuation of automobile mileage.
Lacetera, Pope, and Sydnor (LPS, hereafter) found that wholesale prices of used vehicles
with mileage just over a 10,000-mile threshold were $150 to $200 lower than the prices of
vehicles with mileage just under the same threshold. These results are intriguing because they
suggest that left-digit bias exists in a wholesale auction market in which the buyers and sellers—
car dealers, vehicle lessors, and fleet owners—are all parties that participate in these transactions
frequently and in large volumes. LPS speculate that the wholesale price discontinuities arise
because dealers who participate in the wholesale market anticipate that final customers in the
retail market will find the first digit of the odometer more salient than trailing digits.
In this paper, we look specifically at retail data on used vehicle transactions and find that
retail price effects around 10,000-mile thresholds follow a very similar pattern to the price
effects in the wholesale market. This suggests that the wholesale price discontinuities are driven
by the limited attention of retail customers. We combine our data on retail price discontinuities
with a simple model of left-digit bias to estimate the inattention parameter implied by the retail
price discontinuities. We also investigate whether this parameter varies by the income of used
vehicle buyers.

I. Data
Our data come from two sources. Data on wholesale transactions come from one of the largest
operators of wholesale used car auctions in the United States. In these auctions, vehicles are sold
by dealers and by fleet and lease companies in an English-style auction to licensed car dealers.
We have detailed information on more than 22 million transactions occurring between 2002 and
2008.
Information on retail used vehicle transactions comes from a major market research firm that
collects detailed data on every transaction that occurs at a sample of about 20% of the new car
dealerships in the U.S. We use data on used vehicle transactions between 2001 and 2008, a total
of about 16 million transactions. For every transaction, the data include information about the
vehicle transacted (including make, model, model year, and trim level), the price negotiated
between the customer and the dealer,2 and the average demographic characteristics (from the
2000 Census) associated with the buyer’s census block group.3

II. Inattention and retail prices
We begin our investigation of the effect of left-digit bias on retail prices with a descriptive
analysis. Figure 1 plots by 500-mile bins the average retail price of the used vehicles in our data
(in black circles) and the average wholesale price (in grey triangles). The two plots echo each
other strikingly, with both showing pronounced discontinuities in prices at 10,000-mile odometer
thresholds. Over the entire range of mileage depicted in the figure, the prices of vehicles in the

For transactions involving a trade-in, our measure of price subtracts off the difference between what the dealer paid
the customer for the trade-in vehicle and the actual cash value of the trade-in as booked by the dealer (a figure we
observe separately). In other words, if the customer lost money on the trade-in, we add that to the purchase price. If
the customer made money on the trade-in, we subtract that from the purchase price.

retail market fall by about $50 on average between most 500-mile odometer bins (excluding the
differences between bins just above and just below a 10,000-mile threshold). In contrast, the
average price decrease at a 10,000-mile threshold is $448. Since vehicles do not undergo any
sudden change in functionality or performance when they cross an odometer threshold, these
changes in prices appear to be driven by changes in consumer perception of vehicle value.4
The volume of retail transactions is also distinctly higher for vehicles with mileage just above
rather than just below 10,000-mile thresholds, as shown in Figure 2.5 This pattern raises an
interesting puzzle. Used vehicles sold by new car dealers come from two sources: the vehicles
that a dealer accepts as trade-ins, and vehicles it purchases at auction. Vehicles at auction come
from other dealers’ trade-ins and from the sales of fleet owners (such as car rental companies)
and lease returns. LPS found that there is no effect of 10,000-mile increments on the auction
sales of vehicles by fleet and lease sellers,6 but that there is an effect for the auction sales by
dealers. These results—that dealers sell a higher volume of vehicles with mileage just above a
10,000-mile threshold than just below it at both wholesale and retail—suggests that there is a
greater supply of vehicles coming into dealers from trade-ins that have mileage just above a
10,000-mile threshold that just below it. In other words, the implication is that customers are in
trading in a disproportionate share of vehicles just before they cross a 10,000-mile threshold.
In Figure 3, we show the total volume of trade-ins taken in by the dealers in our sample
collectively, grouped into 1000-mile bins.7 The pattern is similar to the retail volume data in
Figure 2, with a higher volume of trade-ins whose mileage is just under the threshold than just
4

As LPS discuss, these effects are unlikely to be driven by warranties or other factors that might affect the
fundamental value of a vehicle.
5
Figure 2 also shows two areas of bunching not at 10,000-mile increments. These are most likely created by the sale
of formerly leased vehicles returned just before hitting 36,000- and 48,000-mile limits written into the lease terms.
6
Fleet and lease auction volumes are higher around the typical lease mileage limits of 36,000, 48,000 and 60,000
miles.
7
There are fewer observations of trade-ins than of sales, and the trade-in data are noisier than the volume data,
which is why we aggregate to 1000-mile bins; noisier effects exist when looking at 500-mile bins.

over it.8 This is particularly true of the 100,000-mile threshold.9 Taken together, these volume
results suggest that limited attention changes not only the prices at which vehicles transact, but
also potentially changes the composition of vehicles that trade in markets.

III. Estimating the inattention parameter
Building on the inattention framework developed in DellaVigna (2009), LPS propose a simple
model of left-digit bias which captures the idea that the left-most digit of a number is fully
salient to consumers, but that consumers do not fully incorporate finer details of large numbers.
On the basis of the model, LPS estimate a structural parameter that captures the degree of
inattention in their wholesale transaction data. We repeat the procedure here, and compare the
degree of inattention implied by the retail market patterns to that implied by the patterns in the
wholesale auction market.
A used vehicle is a durable good whose value depreciates with mileage,
is the value of the vehicle when new, m is the mileage of the vehicle, and

–

, where K

is the per-mile rate of

depreciation. If buyers are only partially attentive to mileage, the perceived value of a used
vehicle is ̂

– ̂ , where ̂ is the perceived mileage. In our empirical results, we allow

consumers to have left-digit bias, meaning that the left-most digit of the odometer reading is
correctly perceived by the buyer, but that digits to the right are accorded less attention. We
capture this in our empirical specification by allowing digits to the right of the first digit to be

8

This pattern cannot be explained by what customers are paid for their trade-ins. The actual cash value at which the
dealer books the trade-in falls as vehicles cross a 10,000-mile increment, consistent with the wholesale price results,
but the amount that dealers pay customers do not fall by as much, meaning that vehicle buyers are actually paid a
little more relative to what their vehicles are worth for vehicles just over a 10,000-mile increment.
9
A simple supply and demand model would suggest that vehicles in higher volume would trade at lower prices, all
else equal—in particular, under similar demand conditions. The fact that these vehicles sell at higher prices is further
evidence that inattention is an important driver of these prices. Other “supply” effects may in principle operate if
buyers were interested in purchasing vehicles within very narrow mileage intervals; however, this is not the case in
general and people, when shopping for a used car, typically consider wide mileage ranges.

regression:
.

(1)

Priceij is the observed transaction price paid in transaction i for vehicle j. The covariate mij is the
odometer mileage at the time of sale. MileageRemainderij is defined as mij modulo 10,000 for
vehicles with mileage between 10,000 and 99,999 and as mij modulo 100,000 for vehicles with
mileage of 100,000 or more. For example, if m = 78,123, then MileageRemainder = 8,123.
represents “vehicle-type” fixed effects for vehicle j, defined as the cross-product of make, model,
model year, and trim level. The inclusion of these vehicle-type fixed effects allows us to
improve the precision of the estimates and to account for potential selection issues that may arise
from the volume patterns documented in Figure 2 if the composition of vehicles differs on either
side of a threshold. To allow for a flexible functional form for depreciation, we estimate equation
(1) separately by 10,000-mile ranges of mileage between 15,000 and 105,000 miles (e.g. between
15,000 and 25,000 miles, between 25,000 and 35,000 miles, and so on).
The results of the estimation are reported in Table 1. The first panel (“Retail – All”) shows
the results using the retail data. The first row of the panel displays the estimated discontinuity in
residual price, net of “vehicle type” fixed effects ( ), at each mileage threshold from 20,000
through 100,000.10 The second row of the panel reports the estimated depreciation rate, in dollars
per mile. This estimated depreciation rate decreases with mileage, from 14.8 cents per mile of

These discontinuities are smaller than the discontinuities in Figure 1 because the vehicle-type fixed effects absorb
some variation in raw prices.

usage for vehicles between 15,000 and 25,000 miles to 8.6 cents per mile for vehicles between
95,000 and 105,000 miles.
The estimated inattention parameter and its standard error are reported in the last two rows of
the panel. The estimated degree of inattention ranges between 0.074 for the lowest mileage
vehicles, to 0.467 for the highest mileage vehicles. This implies that buyers are more inattentive
to mileage for vehicles with high mileage than for vehicles with low mileage. This pattern of
rising inattention for vehicles with higher mileage could arise if buyers of less expensive highmileage vehicles are particularly inattentive. The pattern could also potentially reflect some
degree of rational inattention. Because the price of high-mileage vehicles actually decreases less
with mileage than the price of low-mileage vehicles do, it may be somewhat less important for
buyers to pay attention to variations in mileage for higher-mileage vehicles.
The second panel of Table 1 reports the analogous results estimated for vehicles sold in the
wholesale auction sample used by LPS. The discontinuities in wholesale prices at 10,000-mile
increments are in most cases smaller (on average by about 40%) than those in retail prices at the
corresponding increments. Despite these smaller discontinuities, however, the estimated
inattention parameter is larger in the wholesale sample than it is in the retail sample. While this
result seems counter-intuitive initially, it can be explained by how estimates of inattention relate
to the underlying rate at which a vehicle’s value depreciates by mileage. The more quickly prices
depreciate with mileage, the smaller the degree of inattention required to generate a price
discontinuity of a given size. With slower rates of depreciation, customers must be more
inattentive to generate the same size price discontinuities. Retail prices, as can be seen in Figure
1, are marked up considerably over wholesale auction prices. Consistent with this, wholesale
auction prices are estimated to depreciate at roughly half the rate of retail prices. In our data, the

6

rate at which retail prices depreciate is enough higher than the rate at which wholesale prices
depreciate that, even though the price discontinuities are also larger in the retail prices, we
estimate a lower rate of inattention in the retail data. This result has important implications for
interpreting the structural behavioral parameters. In particular, this result suggests that if one
hopes to quantify inattention it is crucial to understand the underlying dynamics of the market. In
this case, and perhaps more generally as well, attempting to measure an end-consumer structural
parameter using data from an intermediate market can significantly bias findings.
In the last two panels of Table 1, we separate customers into two groups based on the average
income of the census block group in which they live. Buyers are categorized as low income if
they live in a census block group with income less than or equal to $46,597 and high income
otherwise. The estimated inattention parameters for any vehicle mileage range are generally
higher for low income buyers than for high income buyers, but the differences are very small.

IV. Conclusion
In this paper, we examined the extent to which customers are inattentive to mileage in retail
transactions for used vehicles. Prices and volumes of vehicles with mileage just under 10,000mile thresholds are higher than for vehicles with mileage just over 10,000-mile thresholds,
suggesting that vehicle buyers are partially inattentive to mileage. These results show clearly
that the literature exploring the effects of salience and limited attention in decision-making can
be extremely important for understanding the dynamics of important, well-functioning markets
where buyers and sellers have large stakes. The results also show that the effect of biases can
propagate through related markets; in this case, from retail markets to wholesale markets.

7

In this paper we also show that market-level prices can be used to estimate structural
parameters from a simple model of consumer-level inattention. Estimating the model allows us
to explore patterns of inattention that cannot be inferred simply from the observed price
discontinuities. Our findings suggest, for example, that consumers are more inattentive to
mileage for vehicles with higher mileage. However, we find little effect of income differences on
how attentive consumers are. Importantly, we show that inferences about inattention depend on
the characteristics of the market. In particular, our results suggest that it may be misleading to
estimate a consumer-level structural parameter on the basis of data from an intermediate market.
