    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper estimates the causal effect of the boll weevil on home ownership, wages, and intergenerational mobility of Black and White sons born around the time of its arrival. The boll weevil resulted in a negative shock to cotton production and a positive shock to food-related agricultural products. Using a linked data set of fathers and sons, we find Black sons born after the weevil\u2019s arrival experienced large relative gains in outcomes. The paper discusses a number of mechanisms and provides evidence on two related mechanisms: relative improvements in Black fathers\u2019 income ranks and improvements in Black sons\u2019 early-life conditions.\n\n",
