JEL No. F1, N7
ABSTRACT
This paper presents new estimates of the average tariff on total and dutiable U.S. imports from 1790
to 1820. These previously unavailable series are comparable to the tariff figures available from 1821
in the Historical Statistics of the United States. These early tariffs were much lower, on average,
than those imposed later in the nineteenth century. The paper stresses the importance of deducting
drawbacks (tariff rebates on imported goods that are subsequently re-exported) from total customs
revenue in calculating the average tariff and briefly examines the structure of tariffs across goods.

New Estimates of the Average Tariff of the United States, 1790-1820

The first order of business for the new Congress under the Constitution of 1787 was
raising revenue to fund the government’s operation and to service the public debt. On April 8,
1789, two days after the first Congress achieved a quorum, James Madison introduced a proposal
to levy duties on imported goods. This tariff proposal became one of the first pieces of
legislation passed by Congress and was signed by President George Washington on July 4, 1789.

Import duties played a critical role in the fiscal, trade, and foreign policy of the new
United States, yet there are significant gaps in our understanding of tariff policy during this
period. One basic question that remains unanswered is the average height of the tariffs that
Congress enacted in the three decades after 1789. To shed some light on U.S. trade policy
during the first three decades of the republic, this note constructs new estimates of the average
tariff on total and dutiable U.S. imports from 1790 to 1820. These previously unavailable series
are comparable to the tariff figures available from 1821 in the Historical Statistics of the United
States. This note also stresses the importance of deducting drawbacks (tariff rebates on imported
goods that are subsequently re-exported) from total customs revenue in calculating the average
tariff and briefly examines the structure of tariffs across goods.

Early U.S. Tariff Statistics
The U.S. government began the systematic collection of statistics on international trade
in 1821. From these statistics, the “average tariff” on imports has been calculated as the ratio of
revenue from import duties to the value of imports for domestic consumption.1 Such figures,

-2presented in the Historical Statistics of the United States (HSUS) as series U 211-212, are
commonly used as an indicator of U.S. trade policy because tariffs usually have been the
government’s most important type of trade intervention.
Sufficient data exist to construct a comparable tariff series for years prior to 1821.
Before that year, the federal government published data on the value of exports and the value of
imports paying ad valorem duties, but not the total value of imports. In 1835, drawing on
unpublished records and other sources, the Treasury Department compiled estimates of the total
value of imports from 1790 to 1820. Using these data in conjunction with government reports on
customs receipts permit the construction of an average tariff series from 1790 to 1820.2
Table 1 presents the underlying data for the new tariff estimates. The values of imports,
re-exports, imports for consumption, and duty free imports prior to 1821 are derived from
North’s (1960) improvements to the original estimates presented in the 1835 Treasury report.
Following the convention in the HSUS and elsewhere, exports of foreign products (re-exports,
column 2) are deducted from total imports (column 1) to arrive at imports for domestic
consumption (column 3). The 1835 Treasury report and North also provide separate figures for
the value of duty-free imports for consumption (column 4).
The figures for the gross revenue raised by customs duties on imported merchandise
(column 5) are drawn from a Treasury Department compilation in 1838. These data allow the
calculation of the average tariff on total imports for consumption (column 6) and on dutiable
imports (column 7) starting in 1790.3 Unlike later periods in U.S. history, the gap between the
average tariff on total imports and the average tariff on dutiable imports is very small before
1821. This is because few commodities received duty-free treatment in early tariff legislation.

-3These measures of the average tariff are directly comparable with those in the HSUS that
begin in 1821. Yet the average tariff jumps sharply from 1820 to 1821; according to the
government’s statistics, the value of imports fell sharply in 1821 from the previous year, but
customs revenue was actually higher. The consistency of the 1838 Treasury revenue series and
the HSUS revenue series (U 210) from 1821 is assured by the nearly identical figures in
overlapping years. Although there were no legislative changes in import duties during these
years, import prices fell 11 percent in 1821, which may have contributed to the rise in the tariff
by increasing the ad valorem equivalent of the specific duties.4
Although consistent with the HSUS series, this average tariff calculation gives a
misleading view of the height of import duties during this period in American history. The
reason is that the revenue figures are derived from tariffs imposed on all imports, not just imports
for consumption. This distinction is critical when re-exports are an important part of trade, as
they were for the United States during this period. The tariff revenue collected on imports that
were later re-exported was returned to merchants in the form of a drawback.5 Thus, using
revenue from total imports overstates the average tariff since some of the revenue was rebated
back to merchants and therefore was not collected on goods sold to domestic consumers; i.e., the
numerator is revenue from duties on total imports while the denominator is imports for domestic
consumption (total imports minus re-exports).
The appropriate measure of the tariff would use customs revenue net of drawbacks as the
numerator. The 1838 Treasury compilation distinguishes the gross amount of revenue raised by
tariffs on merchandise and the amount rebated on re-exported goods (drawbacks) starting in
1790. Column (8) of Table 1 presents government figures on the value of drawbacks. Columns

-4(9) and (10) calculate the average tariff using the net proceeds from customs receipts, i.e., gross
tariff revenue minus drawbacks (column 5 - column 8) through the year 1836.
A comparison of columns (6) and (9) demonstrates that, when re-exports are large, the
tariff calculated with gross customs revenue can significantly overstate the actual tariff (adjusted
for drawbacks). This overstatement was as large as 14 percentage points; in 1801, for example,
the average tariff using gross revenue was 35 percent, while the average tariff using net revenue
was 21 percent. The discrepancy is substantial even in the 1820s. According to the standard
calculation using gross revenue, the so-called Tariff of Abominations in 1828 helped push the
average tariff up to 57 percent by 1830, but adjusting for tariff rebates indicates that the actual
tariff was nearly 10 percentage points lower at 48 percent in that year.
Figure 1 depicts the course of the average tariff calculated using gross and net revenue
(i.e., using data from columns 6 and 9) relative to total imports for consumption during this
period. The gap between the two tariff series is particularly large during the period from 1795 to
1810 when re-exports were a significant feature of U.S. trade. Re-exports surged after war broke
out between Britain and France in 1793 as U.S. merchants filled the void left by the warring
parties by carrying merchandise to and from Europe. For example, U.S. re-exports jumped from
$8 million in 1795 to $26 million in 1796 partly for this reason, as well as the greater access
given to U.S. shippers to the West Indies as a result of the Jay treaty of 1795.6 By 1800, over 40
percent of total U.S. imports were re-exported to other destinations.
This re-export trade essentially vanished when the United States was at war with Britain
between 1812 and 1814. With almost no drawbacks to be paid, the gap between the two tariff
measures disappears during this period. The re-export trade was renewed after the conclusion of

-5the War of 1812, but never again played as large a role in U.S. trade as it had during the special
circumstances of the Napoleonic wars. Still, re-exports were not inconsiderable even as late as
the 1820s. The share of total U.S. imports re-exported was 22 percent, on average, during the
1820s, but by 1850 had dropped to 5 percent. Thus, as Figure 1 illustrates, the discrepancy
between the two tariff calculations diminished rapidly in the early 1830s as re-exports became a
smaller component of U.S. foreign trade.
What does the new tariff series in column 9 imply about the height of U.S. tariffs in the
pre-1821 period? Although import tariffs were relatively low in 1790 and 1791, at around 12
percent, legislative revisions to the initial duties quickly brought the tariff up to about 20 percent.
Over the thirty-one year period from 1790 to 1820, the mean of the average tariff was 21.5
percent with a standard deviation of 7.1 percentage points. The tariff appear to be quite volatile,
due to legislative changes in the rates of duty, the influence of import price movements on the ad
valorem equivalent of the specific duties, and the shifting composition of imports across
different rates of duty. Each of the early tariff spikes – in 1794, 1799, and 1804 – are
proximately related to legislation that raised duties. The period from 1812 to 1815 stands out as
a period of particularly high tariffs because Congress doubled tariff rates in 1812 to help finance
the war against Britain.

The Structure of Early U.S. Tariffs
These tariff estimates indicate the relative height of import duties over time, but reveal
nothing about the structure of those duties. This section briefly considers the structure of import
duties during the 1790s and early 1800s.

-6The first tariff act of the United States consisted of three parts: specific duties on a select
number of commodities, ad valorem duties on most other goods, and duty free treatment for a
small number of items. Specific duties were initially imposed on thirty six goods, including
beer, wine, and spirits, molasses, salt, and sugar, tobacco, tea, and coffee. The specific duties
were viewed as a tax on luxuries consumed mainly by the wealthy and their main purpose was
revenue.7 Many of the commodities subject to specific duties (such as wine, sugar, tea, and
coffee) were not generally produced in the United States during this time. Some of the duties
provided incidental protection to some producers; although domestic spirits were subject to an
excise tax, for example, it was much less than the import tariff. And a small number of specific
duties were explicitly imposed for the benefit of domestic producers, such as those on boots and
shoes, nails and spikes, fish and hemp.
Ad valorem duties were imposed on almost all other imports, including manufactures of
wool, cotton, silk, hemp, and flax, manufactures of metals (except nails and spikes), and
manufactures of earth, stone and leather (except boots and shoes). The ad valorem tariffs were
initially set at four levels: 15 percent (on carriages and parts), 10 percent (on china, stone, and
glassware, among a few others), 7.5 percent (on clothing, hats, hammered or rolled iron, tin
manufactures, leather manufactures, among others), and 5 percent duties on all articles not
enumerated. Finally, seventeen goods were placed on the duty free list, including saltpetre,
brass, tinplates, iron and brass wire, cotton and wool, hides, furs, and skins.
This basic tripartite structure remained a consistent feature of the tariff code throughout
this period, although the rates of duty were subject to frequent change. Indeed, given that
virtually all government revenue was derived from customs receipts and that the revenue

-7generated by the initial tariffs was uncertain, the specific duties were fine tuned almost
immediately in order to provide additional revenue.8 In January 1790, in his first report to
Congress as Treasury Secretary, Hamilton proposed increasing the duty on Madeira wine from
18 cents to 20 cents, on Hyson tea from 20 cents to 40 cents per pound, on coffee from 2.5 cents
to 5 cents per pound, among other adjustments. Congress enacted most of Hamilton’s
recommendations in the tariff of August 1790. Also acting on Hamilton’s advice, Congress
increased the duties on spirits in March 1791.
In 1792, import duties were increased to finance expenditures related to the protection of
the western frontier.9 As a “temporary” measure, the ad valorem schedule was advanced 2.5
percentage points, pushing the base ad valorem rate from 5 percent to 7.5 percent. In 1794, the
schedule was hiked another 2.5 percentage points, bringing the base rate to 10 percent, in order
to pay down the public debt at a faster pace. In 1797, higher specific duties on sugar, molasses,
tea, cocoa, and other products were enacted, along with a higher base rate of 12.5 percent. The
revenue was again devoted to debt reduction. In 1804, the ad valorem schedule was increased
another 2.5 percentage points (bringing the base rate to 15 percent and the top rate to 22.5
percent) to establish a “Mediterranean fund” that would finance naval protection against the
Barbary pirates. Finally, in July 1812, tariff rates were doubled with the outbreak of war with
Britain. The Tariff of 1816 reduced these rates but kept them higher than they had been prior to
the war.
As a general matter, specific duties were largely imposed on beverages (coffee, tea, and
alcohol) and consumption items (sugar) whereas ad valorem duties were imposed on most other
products. While revenue was a motivation for both types of duties, ad valorem duties tended to

-8cover imports of manufactured goods (cloth, iron, glass, etc.) for which protection of domestic
producers was also an issue. Was the increase in the average tariff after 1790 due to a rise in the
ad valorem duties or a rise in the specific duties? Table 2 lends some insight into this question
by calculating the average tax on imports subject to ad valorem duties and the average tax on
imports subject to specific duties. Although it is difficult without import price data to determine
the implicit ad valorem rates of the specific duties, those rates can be backed out of the Treasury
reports on the value of imports subject to various ad valorem rates and information on aggregate
imports and the average overall tariff. This calculation is subject to the usual bias in that imports
subject to high duties receive a lower weight in the index due to the reduced quantities.
The table indicates that the combination of higher specific and ad valorem duties pushed
up the average tariff after 1790. The specific duties tended to fall in the range of 30 percent to
60 percent. Ad valorem duties on manufactured and other goods remained relatively low
through the 1790s, rising from 5 percent to just over 15 percent by 1810. Although these duties
did not provide nominal protection to import-competing producers as high as tariffs later in the
nineteenth century, the degree of insulation from world markets was more considerable when the
transportation, insurance, and other costs of trade are taken into account.

Conclusion
This note provides estimates of the average tariff of the United States for the years 1790
to 1820 that are consistent with the series dating from 1821 in the Historical Statistics of the
United States. These early tariffs were much lower, on average, than those imposed later in the
nineteenth century. An important feature of the tariff calculation is the adjustment of gross

-9customs revenue by the amount of tariff revenue rebated to merchants in the form of drawbacks.
Re-exports were an important component of U.S. international trade during this period, and this
adjustment reduces the standard estimates of the average tariff, even as late as the 1820s and
early 1830s.

1. Imports for domestic consumption are those retained by the United States and is calculated by
deducting re-exports (i.e., imports subsequently shipped to other countries) from total imports.
2. I have been able to find only two other tariff series for the pre-1821 period, one starting in
1791 in Young, Special Report, p. 113 and another starting in 1802 in U.S. Senate, “Rates of
Duty,” p. 305. Young understates the tariff by using the net amount of customs revenue raised
after deducting the cost of collection. (Many government documents of this period report net
revenue; the cost of collecting the tariff was roughly 4 percent of the gross revenue raised by
import duties.) The Senate series is more consistent with the series developed here, although it
omits the years prior to 1802 and differs in the reported value of imports.
3. One source of error, however, relates to the time period of the data: trade statistics were
collected for fiscal years ending September 30 of each year, whereas the revenue collected from
duties were reported on a calendar year basis. This mismatch also appears to affect the HSUS
series.
4. Import prices are from North, Economic Growth of the United States, p. 243. Better
enforcement of customs collections and shifts in the composition of imports across the schedule
of duties might also have contributed to the tariff increase.
5. A provision for drawbacks was included in the first tariff act. The provision permitted the
rebate of all import duties paid (except one percent, which was charged for customs expenses) of
goods sent to any other country within twelve months of having been imported.

-186. Adams, “American Neutrality,” and Goldin and Lewis, “Role of Exports,” examine the
contribution of re-exports and shipping services to U.S. economic growth during this period.
7. As Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton wrote in 1790 his report on public credit,
“The Secretary conceives that it will be sound policy to carry the duties [on wine, spirits
(including those manufactured within the United States), teas, and coffee] as high as will be
consistent with the practicability of a safe collection [of revenue]. . . . That the articles which
have been enumerated will, better than most others, bear high duties, can hardly be questioned.
They are all of them in reality luxuries; the greatest part of them foreign luxuries; some of them,
in the excess in which they are used, pernicious luxuries. . . . Should the increase of duties tend
to a decrease of the consumption of those articles, the effect would be, in every respect,
desirable. It is not, however probable that this decrease would be in a degree which would
frustrate the expected benefit of the revenue from raising the duties. Experience has shown that
luxuries of every kind lay the strongest hold on the attachment of mankind, which, especially
when confirmed by habit, are not easily alienated from them.” American State Papers, Finance,
Vol. 1, pp. 22-23.
8. In the first two years of the Washington administration, the federal government was almost
completely dependent on import duties for revenue. By 1799, other forms of revenue had only
reduced this dependence to 90 percent.
