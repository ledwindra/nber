    "abstract": "\n\nWomen are less financially literate than men. It is unclear whether this gap reflects a lack of knowledge or, rather, a lack of confidence. Our survey experiment shows that women tend to disproportionately respond \u201cdo not know\u201d to questions measuring financial knowledge, but when this response option is unavailable, they often choose the correct answer. We estimate a latent class model and predict the probability that respondents truly know the correct answers. We find that about one-third of the financial literacy gender gap can be explained by women\u2019s lower confidence levels. Both financial knowledge and confidence explain stock market participation.\n\n",
