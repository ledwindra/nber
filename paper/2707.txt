INVENTIVE ACTIVITY IN EARLY INDUSTRIAL AMERICA:
1846
EVIDENCE FROM PATENT RECORDS, 1790 -

ABSTRACT

A sample of patent records from the United States between 1790 and 1846

is employed to study the patterns in inventive activity. Patenting was
pro-cyclical, and yet began to grow rapidly with the interruptions in

foreign trade that precedad the War of 1812. A strong association between
patenting and proximity to navigable waterways is also demonstrated.
Although the importance of specific nechanissis remains unclear, both the

and cross-sectional evidence iapl that inventive activity was
positively related to tI growth of markets during early industrialization.

Most scholars would agree that inventive activity is primarily
responsible for the improvements in technology that are the basic

contributor to sustained increase in per capita income) Yet, despite
great interest in the onset and process of industrialization in the United
States, there has been only limited study of the circumstances behind the
sharp rise in the commitment of resources toward the discovery of new
methods of production and the formulation of new products that was

presumably at the root of this transformation. Indeed, virtually no
systematic record of the trends or patterns in inventive activity during the
crucial initial phase of growth has been available.

Not that the phenomenon of inventive activity in early industrial
America has been ignored, for the subject has received serious attention

from several groups of researchers. Perhaps most valuable are the richly
detailed studies of the progression of technique in specific industries

contributed by the historians of business and technology.2 These works
contain a wealth of information, but although hypotheses about general
patterns are often posed, their typical mode of investigation has been to
illustrate theories with individual cases, rather than to explore their
consistency with a large body of evidence.

Economic historians have also been concerned with the record of

inventive activity during industrialization. The basis for their interest
was elaborated by David Landes in his classic examination of the Industrial

Revolution. Following a path blazed by Jacob Schmookler, Landes argued
eloquently for the critieal importance of demand, especially in this context
of the early expansion of markets, in influencing both the level and

-2direction of inventive activity.3 Critics of this view, such as Joel Mokyr
and Nathan Rosenberg, have questioned the representativeness of the specific
cases cited by Landes, offered counterexamples, and discussed in general the

intellectual or technical interrelatedness of many inventions.4 Their
principal objection is that prior to industrialization, the existing stock
of knowledge allowed for only a very limited amount of further invention;

since shifts in demand soon exhausted its modest potential, they alone
cannot explain much of the progress or direction of change in technology
during the era.

Much of the debate has been framed in terms of the relative importance
of demand and supply in the British experience, but the same issues are

relevant to the study of industrialization in the United States. Recent
work on the record of productivity growth in early industrial America has
found that rapid advances were realized by nearly all industries in the
Northeast long before steam engines and highly mechanized manufacturing

processes were widely diffused. It has been proposed that the beginning of
this upsurge was powered by a general increase in the incentives to
inventive activity that triggered improvements in the production of all
sorts of outputs.5
One such broad stimulus to invention was the major growth in size and
geographic extent of markets that marked the period, and is generally

characteristic of the early stages of industrialization. This phenomenon
would have directly spurred invention if the associated increase in demand
faced by individual producers had boosted the perceived return to invention,
and thereby encouraged the commitment of more inputs to the search for

improved methods and products.6 Other developments that might have

-3accompanied the expansion of markets, including changes in cultural
attitudes, learning-by-doing, the propensity to invest, information flows,
the organizations of production, output mix, the degree of specialization,
and the amount of resources available for inventive activity, could also

have played important roles. Whatever the relative significance of these
individual contributors, the possibility that the growth of markets served
to ignite and redirect creative energy is of special interest because of its
relevance for how economic advance became self-sustaining.7
The limited availability of evidence has prevented scholars from
systematically studying the variation in inventive activity over time and
place.8 In attempting to remedy the deficiency, this article follows the
approach of Schmookler in employing a sample of patent records from the

United States between 1790 and 1846. It describes the data and the workings
of the patent system during that period in section II. In section III, the
basic patterns in the variation of patents per capita over geographic unit
and time are outlined, with particular attention devoted to the striking
pro-cyclicality, as well as to the correspondence of the first major aurge
in patenting with the years of interruption in foreign trade just prior to

the War of 1812. It is argued that these features of the temporal record
indicate that inventive activity was quite responsive to market demand

during the era. In section IV, the cross-sectional variation across
counties in patents per capita is examined, and a strong relationship
between patenting and proximity to navigable inland waterways is

demonstrated. Although the importance of specific mechanisms remains
unclear, the evidence seems to suggest that the extension of the waterway
network during the period stimulated significant increases in inventive

-4activity. Section V obaervea that the analyses of the temporal and
cross-sectional patterns reinforce each other in implying that inventive
activity was positively related to the growth in markets, and offers some
conclusions about the bearing of the results on our understanding of early
American industrialization.

This use of patent records to gauge inventive activity is based on an
assumption that there existed, in the place and period under study, a
reasonably regular relationship, on average, between the allocation of
resources to the search for useful inventions and the acquisition of

patents. Such a relationship may have varied between industries, over time,
or across regions, but the presumption here is that much useful information

can be extracted from the patterns in the data. Indeed,

many investigators

have employed patent records for this purpose and found them valuable as
measures of inventive activity.9

II

The data consist of roughly 4,500 patents filed in the United States
between 1790 and 1846, and were randomly drawn from several indexes

prepared

by the Commissioner of Patents. Included for each is a description of the
invention or discovery patented, its industrial classification, the name and
residence of the patentee, and the date the patent was granted.1°

Other

variables were constructed to supplement this information, such as the
population and labor force allocation of the county in which the patentee
resided, as well as various classifications of the invention by type or

economic sector. The sample includes almost 30 percent of all
over the period under study.

patents filed

-5The nature of the patent system changed significantly over these first

57 years of the nation. At the beginning, applications for patents were
scrutinized carefully for novelty and usefulness, and were awarded jointly
by the Attorney General, the Secretary of War, and the Secretary of State.
This procedure, however, consumed much of the time of Thomas Jefferson, who
held the latter cabinet position and primary responsibility for evaluating

the applications, and it was altered within a few years. The new
arrangement was a system of patent registration, characterized by
essentially no inspection of the applications for either novelty or utility.
For the most part, inventors appear to have simply registered their patents,

while paying the rather substantial fee of $3511 The non-trivial cost
presumably served to screen out many frivolous or valueless inventions.

This system of registration ultimately proved problematic as a means of

protecting the property rights of inventors. By the 1830s there was
extensive litigation and widespread discontent with the process, apparently
stemming from the lack of sttention to originality and technical detail in

evaluating applications. At times, the courts recognized vaguely specified
patents, and issued injunctions to stop the operations of firms utilizing

any related technology. In other cases, they would hear challenges to
patents based on other evidence concerning first discovery or use of an idea
in determining who held the property rights to the income it generated.

Many observers contended thst the rosts of enforcing these property rights
were approaching levels that threatened the viability of the system, and

inhibited inventive activity. In response, a fundamental change in the
patent system was implemented on July 4th, 1836, whereby an office staffed
by professionals with technical expertise was established to review

-6applications systematically for novelty and usefulness. The impact was
dramatic. From a situation in which virtually no complete applications were
turned away, a major share, ranging from 20 to over 50 percent, came to be

routinely rejected. A sharp decline in the number of patents filed was the
immediate short-run effect, but it was later reversed as the volume of
applications and filings began to surge again during the mid-l840s.12
It is clear that at least this one institutional change, the change of
law in 1836, seriously altered the relationship between the level of
inventive activity taking place, and the number of patents awarded. The

exact dating of this break in the pattern facilitates adjustments in the
analysis, but other sources of shift or variation in the relationship
between inventive activity and patenting may not be so easy to allow for.
Such complicating factors do not, however, constitute an insurmountable
obstacle to the use of patent records for studying inventive activity.
Patents reflect a meaningful, even if small, proportion of the total amount
of inventive activity carried out, and much of their variation mirrors

corresponding differences in the resources devoted to invention. Where
alternative explanations of the patterns in patenting emerge, they can be
examined in the particular context.

III

The United States was well endowed for invention and growth from the

outset of the nation. Not only was the economy primed with rich supplies of
natural resources and an educated populace, but its institutions provided

considerable freedom for individual enterprise. Moreover, Americans of the
Early Republic were aware of the economic transformation that had recently

-7begun in England, and of the advances in cechnology chat accompanyied that

process. The response to chese propitious conditions was strong, and
although a precise record is beyond our capabilities at this point, it is
clear that sustained economic growth got under way early in the nineteenth

century. It is, therefore, not surprising chat the plots presented in
Figure 1, of the national total of patents awarded and the number included
in the sample, indicate a substantial increase in inventive activity over

the period from 1790 to 1846. Patents far outpaced population, with the per
capita number rising nearly 500 percent.
Perhaps less expected, however, is that the growth in total patents was

not continuous, but rather concentrated in two intervals that accounted for

virtually all of the progress realized over the entire period. The first
upswing began in the late l790s and continued through 1812. It coincided
with a span of prosperity that was ostensibly broken by a series of
disruptions to foreign commerce induced by British interference with

shipping lanes and the Embargo of 1807. After peaking in 1812, the number
of patents granted each year dropped somewhat, and remained on a plateau
through the War of 1812 and the long contraction that followed the peace.

The second phase of extended advance ran from the economic revival in the
early l820s to July 1836, when the patent law was changed to tighten the

requirements for awards. With the introduction of new standards, the volume
plunged and then stabilized for nearly a decade at a lower level before

turning up in 1846. One might be tempted to ascribe this spell of
stagnation, evident in both applications and issues, to uncertainty about
the unfamiliar system. However, another prolonged slowdown in business
activity, which began in 1837 and persisted until just before the end of the

period, must also have borne some responsibility.

Although time series regressions sustain the strong relationship
between patenting and business conditions over annual data, the evidence for
pro-cyclicality is most compelling when the era is divided into the

sub-periods suggested above. It is hard to reject as coincidental the
observation that patenting grew rather steadily throughout the period except
for the two intervals of protracted economic contraction, 1815-1822 and
Given that these were the only downturns of such duration,

the synchronization appears especially relling. There were several one- or
two-year drops in patenting not obviously associated with a business cycle,
as well as various abbreviated cyclical declines that seem not to have

produced decreases in the numbers of patents awarded. However, neither
phenomenon warrants rejecting the hypothesis of pro-cyclical behavior)4
Using Schmookler's framework, one can explain the correspondence
between parenting and business conditions through the increase in the
expected return to an invention that occurs wirh the number of units over

which the advance can be applied. Hence, the level of resources devoted to
the search for a particular invention would grow with the size of the market
for the relevant output, and inventive activity in genefal would increase

with either cyclical or secular expansion of the economyJt There are, of
course, alternative theories. For example, it might be suggested that
fluctuations in inventive activity drove the business cycles. Besides the
questionable strength of any such effect in the context of an early
industrial economy, however, the experience during the sub-period of the

Embargo appears to contradict this conjecture. Another possibility is that
the growing economy generated more resources for inventive activity, and

-9thus the number of patents rose accordingly. Given the surge in patents
during the Embargo, as well as the muth more rapid rise of patenting than of
national intome or investment, this explanation would require an
extraordinarily high intome elasticity of invention.
The cyclicality in patenting is generally robust across regions and

economic sectors of the country, as indicated in Table I where estimates of
the annual patent rates, classified by sector, are reported for various
regions of the Northeast, and the rest of the United States. Parenting is
expressed on a per capita basis, as it is in the remainder of the paper,
because measures normalized for population size are more meaningful for a
study of how individuals behaved; eight sub-periods have been specified,

with the particular dares selected to delineate intervals marked by relevant

events or cyclical activity. Although there are differences within the
Northeast in the level of patenting and the character of the cycles, the

cyclicality apparent in the national totals is quite general. There are
significant deviations, but most seem readily accounted for. Due probably
to the stimulus of the building of the Erie Canal, for example, patenting in
New York boomed during 1823-1829, and its growth slackened in 1830-1836,
whereas rhe retord in Southern New England was reversed.
The cyclical swings in the other regions, which lagged far behind New
York and Southern New England in achieving high levels of patenting per
capita, are not as pronounced, but the discrepancies may be attributable to

regional variation in business cycles or secular trends. Regional
differences in the timing of major transportation projects, the integration
of markets, and the pace of economic growth might have moderated the
influence of national cycles in cases such as Pennsylvania and the Southern

Middle Atlantic during the 1815-1822 downturn.16
Although the degree of cyclicality in patenting did vary somewhat, the

basic pattern of pro-cyclicality also holds across sectors. Patents in
construction manifest a marked sensitivity to business cycles, consistent

with the recognized greater cyclical volatility of the industry. At the
other extreme, patents in transportation, an industry in which one might
expect secular trends to dominate, seem to have been relatively impervious

to cyclical disturbances. Despite these contrasts in cyclical
responsiveness, the five sector shared fairly equally in the growth of
inventive activity over time. Indeed, so similar were the secular trends at
the national level that, as seen in Table 2, the sectoral distribution of
patents changed only marginally over the period as a whole.17
Cross-sectional patterns can also yield information about the

conditions associated with increases in patenting. There are enormous
differences across regions, with all of the areas within the Northeast
persistently registering higher levels of inventive activity than the rest
of the nation. Perhaps even more interesting, however-, is the substantial

variation within that part of the country. Pennsylvania began the 1790s ma
the leader, but Southern New England and New York participated
disproportionately in the rapid growth of patenting during the first decade
of the century, and came to far surpass all other regions in each aectoral
classification.18 So outstanding were the two regions that by 1805-1811
they had attained levels of patents per capita that were higher than any

reached by their counterparts throughout the era. Only Northern New
England, which realized a sharp upswing during the late 1820s and early
1830s, came close to matching their performance.

There were glimmerings of these regional disparities in 1799-1804, but
the full-blown phenomenon did not materialize until the Eabargo sub-period

of 1805-1811. By then, patents per capita in Southern New England and New
York had increased by 806 and 469 percent respectively over the previous
decade, to levels two to four times those in other parts of the Northeast,

and roughly twenty times that of the rest of the country. The obvious
questions are: why did such a radical expansion of inventive activity occur
then; why was it concentrated in Southern New England and New York; and why

did the resulting inter-regional differentials persist? A valuable clue
comes from the observations that the superiority of Southern New England and
New York extended across all sectors, and that when patenting did
significantly increase in other regions, it was generally associated with a

similarly broad and discontinuous advance. The abruptness of the changes
seems inconsistent with a relatively slowly-evolving aspect of the

environment, such as culture, being responsible. Moreover, the range of
sectors affected implies that the salient factor was not specific to a

narrow set of industries. Accordingly, if the underlying catalyst was a
breakthrough in knowledge, it must have been remarkably general in scope.

Especially given the deficiencies of the alternatives, the most likely
candidate for the source of the spurt in 1805-1811 is the changes in market
demand stimulated, if not produced, by the suspension of foreign trade.19
Even accepting that the interruptions in foreign trade were crucial in
setting off this early surge in invention, one is left to explain why
Southern New England and New York responded most strongly at first, and were

able to maintain their dominance over time. Evidently their resource
endowments had prepared them better for the growth in domestic manufactures

- 12

-

and enterprise engendered by the effective insulstion from the previously
dominant foreign competition. One way in which they were better positioned
is that their populations were more concentrated in large cities. Since
metropolitan centers were relatively rich in location-specific factors
conducive to high rates of inventive activity, such as information flows and
entrepeneurs, their larger population shares in New York and Southern New
England might have helped account for the inter-regional differentials in
20

patenting.

Indeed, the estimates of patents per capita by urbanization class
reported in Table 3 do indicate huge disparities in the levels of inventive

activity between metropolitan centers and other counties. This metropolitan
advantage held across individual sectors (see the figures for manufacturing
and agriculture in the Appendix), and peaked in 1805-1811 before the onset

of a gradual erosion over time. Even as late as the l830s, however, Boston
and Philadelphia exhibited levels of patents per capita that were two to
four times as high as those prevailing in the urban and rural counties of

their respective regions. Given that such stark discrepancies were common
between metropolitan and adjacent counties, they are difficult to
rationalize as due to differences in product markets, and must surely be
related to some fixed or slowly-evolving location-specific factors.

Despite the impressive creativity of their populations, the evidence
revesls that all the world was not Philadelphia, New York, or even Boston.

The large inter-regional differences first materialized in 1805-1811, when
major increases in patenting occurred in many parts of Southern New England
and New York but were essentially confined to metropolitan centers in other

areas. Rural counties in these two regions raised their patent rates by

over 800 percent between 1799-1804 and 1805-1811, while analogous jumps

in patenting in the rest of the Northeast, such as the leap in Northern New
England from a base of 15.1 in 1812-1822 to 33.0 in 1823-1829 and 65.5 in

1830-1836, were not realized until the 1820a or later.21 The magnitude
and persistence of che resulting disparities in non-metropolitan patenting
are sufficient to explain much of the regional dominance of New York and

Southern New England. Indeed, accounting decompositions indicate that,
throughout the period, up to 80 percent of their advantage in regional
figures was due to their higher patent rates in both rural and urban
counties - as opposed to differences in metropolitan rates or distributions

of population.22
Not only was variation in patenting across non-metropolitan counties
important in accounting for inter-regional differences, but invention from

these districts made a significant contribution to national invention. As
is apparent from the distributions of patents and populations reported in
Table 4, citizens of large cities registered a highly disproportionate share
of patents. Since the non-metropolitan counties retained the great bulk of
the population, however, their patents were cumulatively more substantial.
In 1805-1811 and 1830-1836, for example, the residents of non-metropolitan
counties received over 65 and 70 percent respectively of the Northeast's
patents, with those in New York and Southern New England alone filing
roughly 40 percent of the national total in both sub-periods.

At the very

least, these figures indicate that developments in non-metropolitan areas
played a central role in the growth of inventive activity during the

critical early stages of American industrialization. They also suggest how
much of the proceaa is miaaed by a narrow focus on urban centers.

See the note to the tables in the Appendix. Within each cell, the
first figure is the estimated percentage of all U.S. patents issued during
the respective sub-period that originated from the respective geographic

area. Because of the many observations before 1810 that did not contain
information on city of residence, the percentages accounted for by the

urbanization classes may sum to less than the regional total. The second
figure is the percentage of the U.S. population that was estimated to reside
in that geographic area at the mid-point of the sub-period.

IV
Variation in inventive activity over place and time was due to many
factors, but an association between patenting and low costs of
transportation to major markets is one pattern that stands out from an

examination of the maps presented in Figures 2 through 5. As illustrated
for 1805-1811 and 1830-1836, virtually all of the counties in the Northeast
with high patenting rates were either metropolitan centers or in close

proximity to a navigable waterway. This finding suggests a link between
patenting and access to extensive markets, because waterways were the only
means of low-cost transportation over long hauls until the late 1830s, when
railroads first became a feasible alternative.
The two cross-sections alone provide strong evidence, but the changes

over time indicate that the relationship held dynamically as well. During
1805-1811, the non-metropolitan districts with high patenting per capita
were almost exclusively in or near the valleys of navigable segments of

major rivers such as the Connecticut and the Hudson. By 1830-1836, this
network of waterways had been much extended by canals and other
improvements, opening up more areas to extensive markets, and the geographic

extent of greater inventive activity had expanded concomitantly. Perhaps
the most vivid example is New York (Figure 4), where the completion of the

Erie Canal in 1825 seems to have sparked alterations of output mix and a
sharp rise in patenting along its route. Northern New England is another
region in which a remarkable advance in patenting between 1805-1811 and
1830-1836 appears related to extensions of waterways. Whereas no county in
New Hampshire or Vermont (Figure 5) exhibited substantial inventive activity
in 1805-1811, two decades of building canals on the Connecticut and the

Although

the

precise years at which

particular stretches of waterways were made navigable are difficult to

determine the networks depicted on the naps must be roughly correct. The
shading of the individual counties reflects the respective estimates of
levels of annual patents per million residents (or PPC)

exceptions are a few counties in

The only

which the populations were so small that a

very high PPC was achieved with only one parent being accounted for. These
counties were given the intermediate shading, normally associated with a PPC

equal to or greater than 30, hut less than 70. There are several cases in
these figures in which the county boundaries presented for

a sub-period, had

not yet been put into place. However, none of these involve districts which
had elevated levels of patenting, and hence, the geographic patterns are
unaffected,

- 15
Merrimack Rivers, as well as one linking Lake Champlain to the Hudson, led
to major increases in pstenting in a number of the counties touched by the

improvements. Simultaneous shifts in agricultursl production, from sn
-emphssis on grains to one on dairy products, hays, and livestock, slso
reflected the changes in relative prices and other demand conditions that
accompany the integration of an outlying area into a large market.23

How does one account for the areas that do not experience much increase
in patenting? In cases such as Pennsylvania, part of the explanation may be
the scarcity of low-cost transportation, and the resulting insulation of

much of the atate from extensive markets. The state was endowed with rich
deposits of coal and iron, but its mountainous terrain limited the number

and extent of navigable waterways. Some rivers such as the Suaquehanna were
eventually cleared, but the exogenous circumstances of topography
constrained the prospects for this sort of development much more than they

had in neighboring New York. There are, in addition, the more puzzling
districts that seem to have enjoyed access to navigable waterways, but did
not realize significant gains in patenting per capita. All of Delaware,
parts of New Jersey, and scattered counties in Pennsylvania and New York
fall into this category. Here there is no obvious answer, other than that

these exceptions deserve special scrutiny. Among the relevant features that
seem worthy of investigation are the ethnicity and literacy of the
population, aa well as the suitability of ocean coastlines for ports.24
Whatever the reaaons for the dampened responses in these areas, the record
suggests that low-coat transportation to market was a necessary rather than
sufficient condition for high levels of inventive activity.

The cross-sectional variation is more systematically examined in the

- 16

-

weighted regressions of patents per capita on county characteristics
reported in Table 5 for 1805-1811, 1823-1829, and 1830-1836. The results
demonstrate that the patterns of inter-regional differentials and the high
rates of patenting in metropolitan centers noted above are statistically

significant under multivariate analysis. Already by 1805-1811, Southern New
England and New York produced far more patents per capita than Pennsylvania,

New Jersey, or Delaware, even after adjusting for the composition of the
labor force, urbanization, and modes of transportation. By 1823-1829,
Northern New England joined the former areas in sharply increasing its

patenting rate. Pennsylvania and its smaller neighbors also made progress
over time, but, after controlling for other factors, continued to lag well

behind the early leaders in 1830-1836. The coefficients estimated on these
dummy variables for region reflect the influences of more fundamental
contributors to patenting that are not otherwise captured by the independent

variables. One should be cautious in framing interpretations, but the
persistence of the same general ranking of regions, and the intense
creativity of metropolitan populations, support the implications of the

simple averages reported above that there were salient location-related
stimuli to invention that were slow to diffuse geographically.25

The finding that most directly bears on the hypothesis that inventive
activity was related to the level of market demand is the positive and
statistically significant coefficient on the proxy for low-cost access to
extensive markets -

being

located on a navigable river or canal. After

controlling for region, urbanization, and the local distribution of the
labor force, counties on navigable inland waterways realized levels of
patents per capita that were well over 50 percent higher in all three

These regressions were estimated ovar nfl northeastern counties
existing at the beginning of the respective sub-periods for which the
necessary information was available: the coefficients are reported with

t-statistics below within parentheses. The observations were weighted by
the populations estimated for the nidpofnts of the periods. The dunuiiy

access to market through a na"Lyibie innnd waterway or by ocean; where

the former was actually the case, th county was classified as having no
access

by ocean. The constant pertains to a rural county in Pennsylvania

without immediate proximity to a navigable inland waterway or the ocean.
Pooled cross-section regressions, with dumay variables for each of the time

periods and relevant interactions, were also estimated. The qualitative
results did not change, except that the coefficient on urban counties became

positive and statistically significant. See the notes to the Appendix
Tables 1 and 2, as well as to Figures 2 through 5.

Although the phenomenon is clearly complex, this strong

positive sssociation between patenting and proximity to navigable rivers and
cansls bolsters the hypothesis that there wss sn important link between
integration into wide markets and inventive activity.

A straightforward interpretation of this finding is that the
introduction of a population to immediate contact with an extenaive market
raised the level of inventive activity on a per capita basis either directly

or indirectly. The direct effect entails individuals and firms choosing to
commit additional resources to a search for useful discoveries in response
to the increase in the expected return to such investment that stems from
their integration into a larger pool of both potential customers and

competing suppliers. A number of influences could be subsumed under
indirect factors. For example, gaining low-cost access to a large market
could alter behavior through changes in the prices of goods or in the
returns to activities, and thus nurture cultural attitudes more favorable to
invention, enhance learning-by-doing, improve the flow of information to
potential inventors, raise the amount of resources available for allocation
to invention, increase the propensity to invest in general, or foster such
changes in methods or in the extent of factor specialization as to
facilitate the discovery of possible refinements in technique or other

inventions. All of these developments, as well as the improvement in the
stock of knowledge arising from directly- or indirectly-induced invention,
would help account for the patterns in the data.
Some information on the relative importance of these direct and
indirect effects can be gleaned from the regressions, but the light shed

should not be exaggerated. The relevant result is that the estimated

- 18

relationship

-

between inland waterways and patenting per capita is robust to

the inclusion of another independent variable to control for the division of

the labor force between agriculture and manufacturing. It tends to undercut
the notion that the influence of access to market on inventive activity was
exerted primarily through its indirect effect on the structure of

production, such as growth in manufacturing. Indeed, it is striking that in
these regressions, and in others estimated with alternative specifications,
there is only a weak association between patenting and the sectoral
distribution of the labor force at the county level after allowing for
region, urbanization, and access to water transportation.
The cross-sectional evidence is thus consistent with the temporal
patterns discussed above in suggesting the operation of a direct effect of

market demand on inventive activity. Moreover, given that proximity to
inland waterways captures only a single source of increase in the extent of
market, and that it still accounted for a rather substantial increase in
patents per capita, the economic significance of all such contributors

together night seem assured.26 Although this exposition emphasizes the
direct mechanisms the apparent responsiveness of invention to the growth of
markets is important regardless of the relative degrees of responsibility

attributed to the direct and indirect effects. Both channels reflect how
powerful the expansion of markets was in spurring the acceleration of
economic growth during the initial phase of American industrialization.
Despite the mutual reinforcement provided by the temporal and
cross-sectional evidence, skeptics might question the significance of, or

causality behind, the latter. For example, it could be argued that the
association between waterways and patenting influenced the geographic

- 19

distribution

-

of inventive activity, but had no effect on regional or

national levels. In this view, individuals undertaking inventive activity
chose to locate in those areas with low-cost access to broad markets, and
would have merely been more concentrated geographically if the

transportation grid had not been as extensive. This objection, however,
appears inconsistent with the historical record. Not only does the
interpretation offer no explanation of the substantial advances in patenting
within regions or the country overall during the period, but it is
contradicted ss a genersl proposition by the many instances in which major
growth in per capita activity was realized by counties with only modest
27

population growth.

A more serious problem concerns the path of causation. Just as
population settlement led the extension of midwestern railroads, it is
possible that various changes in local economies encouraged the extension of

inland waterways to serve the increased demand for such services.28 In
theory, the cross-sectional relationship between high levels of patenting
and inland water transportation could be explained in this way, but other
evidence casts doubt on the view that this was the dominant mechanism at

work. First, nearly all of the inland waterways under study were major
northeastern rivers whose routes were exogenously determined; the chief
exception, the Erie Canal, had its course specified by the state government
in 1817, during a severe economic contraction.29
Moreover, the decisions to undertake the investments in water
transportation considered here were generally settled during the first two
decades of the nineteenth century, prior to any substantial sign of

development in the affected areas. A close examination of the available

- 20
data

-

for the counties along the Erie Canal, for example, indicates that its

construction clearly led any marked changes in patenting per capita or in

the distribution o the labor force.3° No doubt the residents of affected
districts supported the extension of waterways, but the overall record
suggests that such projects were commonly initiated by governmental bodies

concerned with broad goals and constituencies. This background to the
expansion of waterways during the period supports my claim that the
extension of these transportation routes increased rates of patenting and
other types of economic change more than the reverse.31
The conclusion that the extension of waterways did stimulate inventive
activity invites the question of the quantitative significance of the
contribution.

Precise estimates are not feasible, but some rough

calculations are reported in Table 6. Two distinct approaches are employed,
and they yield similar results about the orders of magnitude in the

Northeast. Method I, on which the A and B sets of figures are based, uses
the coefficients from cross-sectional regressions to compute the net changes
in patenting within geographic units that correspond to counterfactual
expansions or contractions of the network of navigable inland waterways

between 1805-1811 and 1830-1836. The A set of estimates, for example,
suggests that after controlling for variables such as region, urbanization,
and county labor-force allocation, levels of patenting would have been much
higher in 1805-1811 if the grid of waterways in New England, New York, and

Pennsylvania had been equivalent to that of 1830-1836. The figures imply
that the proportional impact of the extension of the waterways after
1805-1811 was largest in Northern New England and Pennsylvania, with their

totals of patents rising 49.1 and 26.7 percent respectively. By these

Estimates of the Contribution of the Extension of Navigable Waterways

Notes and Sources:
Method I utilizes t'le coefficients from cross-sectional regressions

(with the same specification as that employed in Table 5, except with more

disaggregated regional dummies) to calculate the hypothethical effects of

having a more extensive network of na ihle waterways than existed in
1805-1811 (the A estimates) or of lio'.'iug a 1055

extensive

network in

1830-1836 (the B estimates). In this ipproacb, the A estimates compute the
implied effect of the additional waterwavs',.:ith the distribution of the

population that existed without them held constant. The calculations were
carried out by comparing the increments to patenting in the appropriate
areas when the dummy variables for river/canal transportation were

counterfactually raised from 0 to 1 or decreased from 1 to 0 (in A and B

respectively). These counterfaccual fitted values were then computed to the
"true" fitted values. By Method II. the C and D sets of estimates were
computed by identifying those counties that gained access to navigable

waterways after 1805-1811 but before 1830-1836. The increase in per capita
patents that was realized by each of these counties, or estimated for the
relevant land area in cases where the county had not been established in
1805-1811, was then multiplied by the estimated county population or
equivalent in 1805-1811, and the county population in 1830-1836 to construct

the C and D figures respectively. Each of the resulting two sets of
estimates of the incremental numher

of patents

clue to the extension of

waterways were then summed across counties, and divided by the average
annual number of patents awarded domestically during 1830-1836. See the
notes to Appendix Tables 1 and 2, as well as to Figures 2 through 5.

- 21
estimates,

-

the extension of the inland waterways in the four regions

examined would alone have accounted for an 18.7 percent increase in U.S.
patents per capita, nearly a quarter of the total advance between 1805-1811
and 1830-1836.

The B set of figures analogously estimates how much lower patenting
iould have been in 1830-1836 if the network of inland waterways had been

restricted to that of 1805-1811. The proportional changes are uniformly
smaller than in the A set, perhaps reflecting the spread of alternative
modes of transportation that reduced the differentials in patenting between
those counties with immediate access to such water routes and those without.
Nevertheless, the qualitative result that the extension of waterways
promoted more patenting, especially in Northern New England and
Pennsylvania, is sustained.

The estimates obtained by Method II are computed by ascribing the
entire increase in per capita patents between 1805-1811 and 1830-1836 in the
relevant counties to the extension of navigable waterways during those 25

years. These advances in per capita rates are applied to the population
totals for the countiea in 1805-1811 and 1830-1836 to calculate a range of
estimates of the proportiona of the total patents emanating from the
specified areas that can be accounted for by such improvements in

transportation. For example, the C set holds the county populations at
the 1805-1811 levels, and assumes that the observed increaaea in their
patents per capita to 1830-1836 were attributable to the extension of the

grid. The significance of improvements in waterways varies enormously
between regions by these figures, ranging from rather minor in Southern New
England to of major consequence in Northern New England.

- 22

-

Even with the rather low population base underlying the C estimates,
17.5 percent of the patents originating from non-metropolitan areas in the
four regions together, 13.1 percent of sli patents from the four regions,
and 10.0 percent of national patents during 1830-1836 can be attributed to

advances in wsterways. These figures imply smaller effects on patenting
than set B, which has the ssme 1830-1836 standsrd, but agree in suggesting
that the extension of the inland waterways accounted for an important share

of the growth in patenting during early industrialization. Set 0 applies
the increases in per capita rates to the actual populations of the counties
in 1830-1836, and accordingly yields even larger estimates.

By either method of estimation, therefore, the growth in patents
accounted for by the extension of navigable waterways amounts to a
significant fraction of the national total, a major share (in the 20-25
percent range) of the entire increase in U.S. patents per capita between
1805-1811 and 1830-1836, and even larger proportions of that increase in

northeastern states. Since the analysis does not distinguish between the
effects of extending the waterways and other factors correlated with them,

there is admittedly a legitimate question about possible biases. Attributing
all of the increase in patents per capita in counties along the routes to

the waterways undoubtedly gives some credit where it is not due. Tending to
offset this upward bias, however, is the lack of attention to other modes of
transportation and the neglect of the stimulus of the expansion of the grid
to invention in districts that had already enjoyed low-cost access to major
markets by 1805.32

V
The initial phase of industrialization in the American Northeast was a

complex process. whose mechanisms are difficult to penetrate. Nevertheless,
this analysis of systematic patterns in patent records has yielded some
insight into the emergence of a greater commitment of resources to the
search for better techniques and products -

a change in behavior that is

fundamental to sustained economic growth. First, in revealing that
patenting on a per capita basis rose substantially in the Northeast during
the first decade of the nineteenth century, and then resumed its
acceleration after the War of 1812 and the postwar contraction, the evidence
is consistent with the view that early industrialization was characterized

by a dramatic upswing in inventive activity. Moreover, the timing of the
event suggests that the Embargo of 1807 and other interruptions in foreign
trade might indeed have served as s catalyst in promoting the expansion of
the non-agricultural sector, increases in the extent and depth of markets,
specialization of producers, invention, and technical change.

Although speculative, the outline emerging from this study is one in
which a relatively prosperous pre-industrial population, which had a working
knowledge of the current technology and was capable of learning fron
advances in Britain, responded strongly to a transformed economic

environment. Given that competition was insured by the small scale of
enterprise, individuals and firms sought to improve their production
technique and develop new products as they became increasingly directed

toward the pursuit of market opportunities. They committed much larger
amounts of resources to inventive activity than previously, and the
resulting stream of discoveries served to boost productivity, through the

- 24

diffusion

-

of the new methods or designs as well as the augmentation of the

stock of knowledge for future invention. These developments were
cumulatively important, if not profound, for the achievement of sustained
growth.

The examination of the patterns in patenting revealed that inventive
activity was quite concentrated in Southern New England and New York at the
beginning of the century, and spread unevenly to the rest of the Northeast

and the nation. Major urban centers stand out especially in having
accounted for a highly disproportionate share of patents, but the majority
of patents continued to be awarded to residents of non-metropolitan

counties. With their dominant share, it was the increase in patenting by
these latter areas that drove most of the national advance,, and that has

been the chief focus of attention here. Notwithstanding the obvious
significance of factors such as slowly-evolving, location-specific
conditions, changes in the stock of knowledge, and learning-by-doing, this
analysis has highlighted the role of the expansion of markets in producing
the acceleration of invention during this episode of early

industrialization. Empirical support for this interpretation comes on
several fronts. First, the marked cyclicality of patenting suggests that
inventive activity was positively related to market demand. The critical
role of growth or shifts in demand, in addition to mere access to the
market, is further apparent in the experience of the metropolitan counties

during the Embargo period. Although their residents had long enjoyed
proximity to the market, and had received more patents than their
counterparts elsewhere, inventive activity seems to have soared in these
urban centers during the years of disruption to trade.

- 25

-

From another perspective, the cross-sectional analysis of the
relationship between extent of market and patenting has also provided

support for the hypothesis. The association uncovered between patenting and
the local availability of water transportation is strong, and quantitatively

important. Admittedly, one cannot necessarily infer the path through which
access to transportation stimulated invention from this evidence alone, and
a variety of indirect effects set off by the impact of transportation on

development might contribute to the result. Yet the implications of both
the cross-sectional and temporal patterns in patenting are that the direct
incentives created by expanding markets did promote more invention.
Regardleas of the relative strengths of the different mechanisms involved,
however, the findings auggeat that the growth of markets during the early
stages of industrialization diffused a powerful and long-term inducement to
inventive activity, and in so doing, helped raise the realization of
economic gains into a self-sustaining process.

FOOTNOTES

1. Simon Kuznets defined inventive activity "as being concerned with
technical inventions, i.e. new combinations of existing knowledge.
potentially useful in economic production and resulting from a mental
performance above the average." See Simon Kuznets, "Inventive Activity:
Problems of Definition and Measurement," in Richard R. Nelson, ed. , The
Rate and Direction of Inventive Activity (Princeton, 1962). Research on
inventive activity is typically framed in terms of either the outputs
produced or the inputs consumed in the process. The outputs yielded by
inventive activity encompass the flow of new ideas, techniques, equipment;
and products that are discovered and/or developed. The inputs include the
costs of labor and other resources involved in the search for inventions.
There appears to be a general consensus among economists who have analyzed
modern patent data that there is a more regular relationship between the
number of patents and the value of inputs to inventive activity than with
the value of outputs; for example, see Ariel Pakes, "On Patents, R
D, and
the Stock l1arket Rate of Return," Journal of Political Economy, 93 (April
1985), pp. 390-409. This article is motivated by a concern with the
circumstances under which individual households and firms came to commit
much larger amounts of resources on a per capita basis to inventive
activity, and the interpretations offered tend to be cast in terms of the
allocation of resources. Nevertheless, the presumption is that, on average
and over the period in question, the level of the outputs produced varied
roughly with the consumption of inputs, and that the substantive
implications of the findings are not sensitive to the perspective adopted.

Invention and Economic Growth (Cambridge, MA, 1966); and David S. Lsndes,
The Unbound Prometheus: Technological Change and Industrial Development in
Western Eurone From 1750 to the Present (Cambridge, England, 1969). In the
Kuznets tradition, Schmookler pioneered the systematic analysis of patent
statistics for the purpose of studying inventive activity. Although
recognizing the variety of experiences across industries, time, and specific
inventions, he argued that the importance of demand, or the extent of the
market, in altering the direction and level of inventive activity had not
been well appreciated. He modeled the decisions of firms regarding the
level of investment in inventive activity as a function of the expected
gains from, and costs of, making a discovery. He argued that the extent or
size of the market facing the firm was a major determinant of the expected
gains, and investigated the relationship between patenting snd proxies for
the size of the market in many contexts. His work with time-series data on
capital-good patents for a number of industries included the demonstration

- 27

-

that the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century trends in railroad
patents of various types, such as those concerning rails, passenger cars
and freight cars, oscillated synchronously with the levels of invescmenc in
those types of capital equipment. Overall, Schmookler concluded that the
expected profits from invention in particular industries were the prime
determinants of the levels of invention in those areas, and that movements
in the demand for the relevant products exerted substantial effects on the
expected profits from invention. Landes employed similar ideas in his
treatment of the onset of industrialization in Britain. Although most of
his references were concerned with the invention in individual industries,
he, like Schmookler, seemed to intend his framework to apply to both the
direction and the level of general inventive activity.
4. Joel Mokyr baa most directly challenged Landea'a perspective on
invention. See Joel Mokyr, "Demand va. Supply in the Industrial
Revolution," this Journal, 37 (December 1977), pp. 981-1008. Although
Nathan Rosenberg generally does put more emphasis than Landea on supply-aide
factors, his atudiea of early nineteenth-century technology provide a rather
balanced view when considered as a whole. Indeed, his attention to the
extensive borrowing and modification of an already existing stock of British
technology implies that the Americana did benefit from a substantial amount
of less than fully exploited knowledge during the initial phase of their
industrialization. In auch a case, or when bottlenecks emerged, shifts in
demand could have induced significant responses in inventive activity or
patenting. See Nathan Roaenberg, "Technological Change in the Machine Tool
Industry, 1840-1910," this Journal, 23 (December 1963), pp. 414-443;

6. In contrast, those who argue for the supremacy of supply contend
that the acceleration of invention stemmed from favorable developments on
the cost side. In this view, technical breakthroughs in one area helped in
the resolution of other technological problems, which in turn led to even
further progress. If this were the major force behind the rise in invention
at the outset of growth, one might expect the spurts of activity, and the
associated gains in productivity, to be clustered in specific sets of
industries. Inventions, whatever their source, alter the stock of

- 28

-

knowledge, and that stock of knowledge surely affects both the conditions of
supply and demand for goods, as well as the impact on further invention of
shifts in demand. Given these complications, as well as the recognition
that there is no general answer, it is obvious that the difficulties of
empirically distinguishing between so-called demand and supply factors are
formidable. With the circumscribed nature of the surviving evidence as an
additional obstacle, it would seem nothing less than heroic to precisely
estimate the quantitative significance of the two sets of variables in more
than a few idiosyncratic cases. Nevertheless, it may be possible to obtain
some notion of the orders of magnitude of their contributions during early
industrialization.
Moreover, such fine discrimination may not be itquired
to determine whether or not inventive activity was highly responsive to the
growth of markets, which may be the most important question concerning the
phenomenon in this context.
7. Igniting creative energy is not exactly the appropriate metaphor.
Humans have exhibited enormous creative energy and inventiveness throughout
their history. Hcwever, much of it has always been directed towards
pursuits that are not fully captured in our conventional measures of
economic activity, such as the production or appreciation of art, the wooing
of companions, schemes for redistribution, and the acquisition of status.
Accordingly, although the total of all forms of inventiveness may indeed
have increased substantially with industrialization, a metaphor that also
encompasses the reallocation of creative energy might be more fitting. For
further discussion of related issues, see Albert Hirschman, The Passions
and the Interests: Political Arauments for Capitalism Before Its Triumph
(Princeton, 1977).
8. A prominent exception to this generalization is Robert Higgs,
"American Inventiveness, 1870-1920," Journal of Political Economy, 79
(May/June 1971), pp. 661-667.
9. Since Schmookler's work, many scholars have used patent records to
study inventive activity. See, for example, the papers in Zvi Griliches,
ed. , R
D. Patents, and Productivity (Chicago, 1984); and Nelson, ed.
The Rate and Direction of Inventive Activity. The problems with such
patent-based measures have been extensively discussed, but economists have
generally come to accept them as useful indicators, especially of the inputs
devoted to the inventive process. For example, see Pakes, "On Patents

By the United States From 1790 to 1847 (Washington, D.C., 1847). A

The real and relative value of this fee fluctuated substantially with
marked swings in the price level. Nevertheless, one can be rather confident
that the $35 in current dollars represented at least 30 percent of per

The classification of business or cyclical activity by year is

information and judgments are provided by Walter B. Smith and Arthur H.
Cole, Fluctuations in American Business. 1790-1860 (Cambridge, Mass.

interacted growth terms for years of recession and years of prosperity,
yield statistically-significant evidence of cyclicality over annual data.
However, the analysis of cyclicality in this article is based not on
comparisons of individual years, but of years grouped together to identify
sub-periods of "generally" consistent cyclical activity (such as
"prosperity" or "recession"). The principal deviations from this procedure
include: the definition of the 1812-1822 sub-period, where the contraction
of 1815-1822 was extended back three years because of the war being fought
on U.S. territory; the classification of the 1805-1811 Embargo sub-period;
and the division of 1836 at July 4th because of the change in the patent
system. One is struck by the similarities in the cyclical patterns of
patenting observed here and those noted by Schmookler. See his Invention
and Economic Growth, chap. 6. In particular, he noted the high correlation
between long-term trends in patenting and the expansion of the market, the
salience of long swings in the growth of patenting, and the tendency of
movments in patenting to slightly lag turning points in business cycles.
His analysis relied on moving averages, as he too held reservations about
the significance of short-term or year-to-year changes in patents.
14.
The one episode that might appear to contradict the claim that
patenting was positively related to cyclical activity is the sharp increase
in the number of patents granted between 1805 and 1811. In this sub-period,
foreign trade was drastically reduced by a series of circumstances including
the Embargo of 1807, and 3 of the 7 years are classified as ones of
recession or depression. Although the spurt in patents defies conventional
cyclicality, it may actually help establish the linkage between patenting
and the state of the market. In particular, many narratives suggest that
the suspension of foreign trade gave an enormous boost to domestic producers
of manufactured goods and other items competing with imports. Hence, the
stimulus to invention provided by this exogenous political development might
be understood aa arising from the vast proportional increase in demand for
non-agricultural commodities and the associated advances in the
specializatiom of producers and the extent of markets. These developments
might reasonably have led to the growth of effective demand for producers of
goods in areas like the Northeast, that enjoyed a domestic comparative

domestic manufactures beforehand, the Embargo period might have begun with
considerable unexploited knowledge and potential for learning-by-doing.
From this perspective, it is perhaps not surprising that the sudden shifts
in resources and concern with production for the market precipitated a spurt
in patenting. See, for example, the discussions of the impact of the
Embargo in Thomas C. Cochran and William Miller, The Age of Enterprise: A
Social History of Industrial America (New York, 1961); Burton Spivak,
Jefferson's English Crisis. 1803-1809: Commerce. Embargo. and the

Renublican Revolution (Charlottesville, 1979); and Claudia D. Goldin and
Frank D. Lewis, "The Role of Exports in American Economic Growth During the
Napoleonic Wars, 1793 to 1807," Explorations in Economic History, 17 (Jan.
1980), pp. 6-25. For evidence of increases in agricultural productivity and
the market orientation of farmers in Southern New England during these
years, see Rothenberg, "The Emergence of Farm Labor Markets."; Winifred B.
Rothenberg, "The Market and Massachusetts Farmers, 1750-1855," this
Journal, 41 (June 1981), pp. 283-314; and Winifred B. Rothenberg, "The
Emergence of a Capital Market in Rural Massachusetts, 1730-1838," this
Journal, 45 (December 1985), pp. 781-808. See Diane Lindstrom, Economic
Development in the Philadelphia Region. 1810-1850 (New York, 1978) , for a
detailed discussion of the impact in eastern Pennsylvania. All of these
fragments of the story lend support to the idea that an expanaion of
intra-regional apecialization and trade within the Northeast, where all of
the rise in per capita patents occurred, could have raiaed per capita income
there as well as increased the size of markets facing potential inventors.
See the presentation of the model, and related discussion in
15.
Schmookler, Invention and Economic Growth, pp. 116-125.
For discussion of the greater severity in Southern New England and
16.
New York of the contraction of 1815-1822, see Cochran and Miller, The Age
of Enterprise. For discussions of the many transportation inveatment
projects undertaken during that contraction see the treatments in Balthasar
Henry Meyer, Caroline E. MacGill, at al. , History of Transportation in the
United States Before 1860 (Washington, D.C., 1917); Carter Goodrich, Julius
Rubin, Jerome Cranmer, and Harvey Segal, Canals and American Economic
Develonment (New York, 1961); and George R. Taylor, The Transportation
Revolution. 1815-1860 (New York, 1962). Another posasible explanation of
the appearance of dampened cycles in regions with lower rates of patenting
per capita, such as the Southern Middle Atlantic and the Other U.S. , is
based on there being two components of patenting. One reflects a modest
background level of inventive activity which was largely exogenous to the
existence of a market, and the other represents a large market-responsive
increment asssociated with a district's integration into a wider market.
This structure implies that the higher the level of patenting within a
geographic unit, the greater the proportion of inventive activity that was
sensitive to national business conditions, and the more cyclically volatile
the record should appear.
17.
This feature of the record is not transparent because of the noise
resulting from the small numbers of sample patents for the first two
sub-periods, 1791-1798 and 1799-1804. After allowing for this problem, the
stability of the national patent shares is striking. For example, in
1805-1811 and in 1843-1846, the proportion of patents classified as
agricultural was the same, 19.2 percent; the proportion of manufacturing
patents rises only slightly, from 44.7 to 47.1 percent. The surface
stability in the national distribution of patents after 1805-11 appears to
be largely the result of averaging across regions that were in different
phases of a common trsnsition and were growing at different rates. Although
the signal in the data is weak, regions seem to have experienced an increase
in the proportion of their patents that were agricultural when they
underwent their first major spurt in inventive activity; as they developed
further, the agricultural share declined. For example, when Southern New
England realized its acceleration in patenting during 1805-1811, the
agricultural and manufacturing shares amounted to 16.7 and 42.6 percent

- 31

-

respectively; by the middle of the 1830s, they had shifted to 7.9 and 56.3
percent. This process is visible in New York as well, but is screened i-n
the nationel record by the relative growth of the Other U.S. region and the
later development of the rest of the Northeast. The stability is
surprising, but is at least partially sccounted for by patents having been
classified on the basis of final use (where the latter was appsrent).
Accordingly, manufactured goods such as seed drills and ploughs are included
in the agricultural category. More generally, however, agricultural
invention might have flourished during the earliest stages of development in
a region, because many farmers would have benefited from expsnsion in the
market they faced and increasingly specialized in producing for that market,
and because certain agricultural products were important inputs in
manufacturing processes.
18.
Again, the estimates of the distributions of the patents filed
during 1791-1798 and 1799-1804 should be viewed with caution, because of the
relatively few observations from those years.
19.
Although some of the patterns observed may be due to variation
over time or place in the inclination to patent, it seems unlikely that such
hypotheses could provide a complete explanation. The moat plausible of such
arguments is that the inclination to register an idea with a patent might
have been higher in big cities. However, the application procedure was
relatively simple, and commonly described in broad-circulation periodicals
of the time, until 1836. Moreover, it is not obvious as to how one might
plausibly account for suitable cycles in inclination or culture. A related
possibility is that the cycles in patenting were driven by movements in the
real value of the patent fee, but the series on prices and patents do not
conform well with it. For example, the number of patents rose sharply
during the 1820s, while the price level plunged.
20.
The interruptions in trade also had the effect of diverting the
resources of urban merchants from foreign to domestic commerce. For further
discussion of the relationship between patenting and urban centers, see
Allan R. Pred, Urban Growth and the Circulation of Information: The United
States System of Cities. 1790-1840 (Cambridge, Mass., 1973); and Higgs,
"American Inventiveness."
21.
Another example is Pennsylvania, where the rural and urban rates
rose from 11.3 and 8.7 respectively to 38.1 and 31.4 between 1812-1822 and
1830-1836. Even with so many diverse counties grouped together, the early
advances in patenting are dominated by jumps, rather than growth along
smooth continuous paths. This pattern is even more striking when one
examines the records of individual counties separately. All counties in
Northerm New England are lumped together in the text here, because there
were no metropolitan centers during this period, and generally no
statistically significant differences between urban and rural counties in
patenting.
22.
The figures generally vary between 50 and 85 percent, depending on
the time period and the regions compared. The results are strongest with
Southern New England, where the metropolitan counties contain only a tiny
fraction of the regional population.
23.
The geographic extension of markets increases both competition and
the size of markets for local producers; each effect could stimulate more
invention. For discussions of the impact of the Erie Canal on household
manufactures and production patterns in New York, see Rolla Milton Tryon,
Household Manufactures in the United States. 1640-1860 (New York, 1917);

and Arthur H. Cole, The American Wool Manufacture (Cambridge, Maas.
1926), Vol. I. For treatment of the changes in the agricultural sector of
Northern New England, see Percy W. Bidwell and John I. Falconer, History of
Asriculture in the Northern United States. 1620-1860 (Washington, D.C.
1941); and Percy W. Bidwell, "Rural Economy in New England at the Beginning
of the Nineteenth Century," Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts
and Sciences, 20 (April l9l), pp. 241-399.
24.
As indicated in the regressions reported below, there is no
significant relationship across counties between bordering on the ocean and
levels of patents per capita. The same types of regressions, when estimated
with county-level literacy rates as an additional independent variable,
indicate a strong positive relationship between literacy in 1840, the first
year for which such rates are available, and patenting during earlier
sub-periods. The line of causation is not clear, however, since literacy in
1840 is only weakly correlated with patenting in 1836-1842 and 1843-1846.
Further investigation is underway. The low levels of patenting in counties
near Pittsburgh, and on major rivers in western Pennsylvania are somewhat
puzzling. The latter pattern might stem from the indirectness of the water
route to eastern cities.
25.
Although the most straightforward explanation of this finding
would probably focus on supply-side factors such as culture, ethnicity,
occupational mix, and access to information or capital, some of these
disparities in patenting across geographic units could plausibly be due to
differences in the density, extent, or structure of markets not already
captured by other independent variables.
26.
The sizes of markets varied with population, per capita income,
the dispersion of technology, the degree of factor specialization, as well
as with business cycles and improvements in the transportation network. All
of these factors may have spurred the growth of markets and inventive
activity. Moreover, the apparent association between market size and
patenting, the likelihood that the restriction of manufactures from abroad
augmented the market for domestic producers, and the evidence that patenting
soared during the relevant years suggest a significant role for the 1807
Embargo and other obstacles to foreign trade in igniting a sustained
acceleration in invention and in productivity growth in the American
Northeast. This view is consistent with recent findings concerning the
record of productivity growth during the early nineteenth century. See
Rothenberg, "The Emergence of Farm Labor Markets, " for evidence on labor
productivity growth in agriculture during the early nineteenth century. See
Sokoloff, "Productivity Growth in Manufacturing," for estimates of rapid
progress in manufacturing between 1820 and 1860. The findings on patenting
and productivity buttress each other in suggesting that many improvements in
technique, accounting for substantial gains in productivity, were realized
long before the broad wave of mechanization that occurred in the 1830s and
1840s, and in relating these changes to the expansion of markets.
Unfortunately, the evidence on manufacturing does not cover the Embargo
sub-period, but the correspondence between increases in productivity and
patenting between 1820 and the 1840s, is consistent with the view that
invention did augment productivity, and that variation in patenting does
reflect variation in such activity.
27.
An excellent example of previously outlying zones whose households
altered their behavior in response to their becoming exposed to the forces
of wider markets, is Northern New England during the l820s and 1830s. As

- 33

-

improvements to rivers, such as the Connecticut, Kennebec, and Penobscot,
were made over these yeara, patents per capita quadrupled. The populations
of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont grew slowly over the interval, and it
seems unlikely that a jump of thia magnitude could be explained fully by the
inflow of invention-prone migrants.

For example, notice that the levels of patents per capita and the
relative size of the manufacturing sector (as measured by the ratio of the
manufacturing labor force to the agricultural labor force) are modest in the
counties along the western half of the Erie Canal prior to its completion in
1825. Yet, major advances are apparent by the early 1830s in patenting
activity. It is also interesting that substantial increases in patents per
capita were realized without large changes in the sectoral allocation of
labor force. Some counties have no estimates for the earlier sub-periods,
because they had not yet been carved out of the lend areas of the others.

In his study of wool manufacture, Cole came to the same conclusion
about the direction of causation in the association between access to wide
markets and the decline of household manufacture of woolens. As the network
of navigable inland waterways was extended, more and more households came to
alter their behavior in order to take advantage of the changed market
environnent:

the home manufacture was 'becoming daily more
exceptional.' And this could hardly be otherwise with the
growth in the factory production, the cheapening and improvement
of its output, and with the advent of better distributive
and more adequate transportation facilities. The operation of
these forces was so slow and inconspicuous that a picture of the
movement cannot often be caught. However, the figures of household
production in New York State, do give us an intimation of what

- 34

-

must have been the experience of the country as a whole...
It is evident that in 1820 the counties nearer the City of
New York and those on the line of the Hudson River had already been
affected by the domestic factory production or had been influenced
by the importation of woolen goods; or contrariwise, the counties
with the highest household manufacture were those located at some
distance from the distributive centers. . . By 1845, however, a
curious split had occurred. The counties of heaviest per capita
production were now in the northern, less well-developed section of
the state, or along the southern border. To one at all familiar
with the history of transportation the reason is plain. In the
interval between 1820 and 1845 the Erie Canal had been completed,
and some portions of railroads reaching out westward from Albany,
both traversing counties which had now ceased to have heavy per
capita production. The introduction of transportation facilities
occasioned a decay in the household industry.
Cole, The American Wool Manufacture, pp. 280-282.
It is interesting to note that Boston, New York City, and Albsny,
32.
which were the metropolitan centers in the regions with the most extensive
networks of navigable inland waterways, generally exhibited much higher
levels of patenting per capita than did their counterparts in other regions.
One might ask whether invention in such urban centers was somehow related to
the volume of intra-regional trade.

Notes and Sources:

The estimates of annual patents per million residents were obtained by
treating the patents included in the sample as if they were representative

of all of the patents issued in the respective sub-periods. The numbers of
patents in the individual cells were inflated by the inverse of the

proportion of total patents included in the sample. The sectoral
classification is based on five sectors, with the miscellaneous category

omitted from Tables 1 and 2. The patents were categorized by final use when
that was apparent, so patents concerning manufactured goods such as ploughs

or harvesters were classified as agricultural patents. The population
figures utilized for the estimates pertain to the mid-points of the
respective sub-periods, where they were computed at the county level, with

exponential growth between census years, and summed as appropriate. The
small number of patents awarded to residents of foreign countries were

omitted from the analysis. Although there were three patents issued in
1790, the estimates of patenting rates reported here do not begin until
1791, because there are no patents from the previous year included in the

sample. Accordingly, the estimates are biased upward somewhat for the first
sub-period. The dividing date between the 1830-1836 and 1836-1842
sub-periods is July 4, 1836, when the new law went into effect. Northern
New England includes Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont; Southern New England

includ.s C.s.cticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island; and Southern Middle
Atlantic includes Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland, and the District of
Columbia.

The indexes from which this sample was drawn contain both the city and
state of residence for the holder of the patent in the great majority of

cases, and especially after 1810. This infomation was utilized to classify
each patent by county of residence in the particular year. The counties
were categorized for urbanization in each census year, and the reported
figures for urban and rural districts are based on a rolling set of

counties. Metropolitan counties, however, are composed in all years of
those counties that contained a city of 50,000 or greater in 1840; urban
counties were those that contained a city of at least 10,000 residents or

were adjacent to a metropolitan county in the respective years. The
observations without information on city of residence were included in the
regional totals, but were generally not reflected in the estimates for

classes of counties. This procedure does lead to some apparent
inconsistencies or anomalies in the estimates, especially for the first two

sub-periods, but seems the most sensible alternative. The only deviation
from this practice was in New York, which was the only state in which there

were significant numbers of such observations after 1810. Casual empiricism
suggests that the great bulk of these patents were held by residents of New
York City, and of the 100 such individuals whose residences could be traced
through various means, approximately 81 percent were from New York City or

Albany. Accordingly, such observations from New York were assigned to the
metropolitan county class with a 0.81 probability in the construction of the
estimates.
