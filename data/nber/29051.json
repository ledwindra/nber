    "abstract": "\n\nThis chapter reviews a recent body of theoretical and empirical work that studies the normative and positive aspects of trade policy. We start by presenting reduced-form evidence of the e\ufb00ects of trade policy in the presence of supply-chain linkages, on the short-run and persistent e\ufb00ects of trade policy across local labor markets, and on the e\ufb00ects of trade policy uncertainty on employment and \ufb01rms. We describe the shift-share method for trade policy analysis, discuss the interpretation of the estimated e\ufb00ects, and provide a theoretical foundation. We then describe new quantitative frameworks, methods, and data used to study the aggregate and distributional e\ufb00ects of trade policy in general equilibrium. We discuss how to take into account supply-chain linkages, local labor markets, and di\ufb00erent sources of dynamics. As an illustration, we quantify the aggregate and distributional e\ufb00ects of the 2018 trade war between the United States and its trading partners. Finally, we present recent theoretical insights on optimal unilateral trade policy with \ufb01rm and product heterogeneity in the context of large and small open economies with perfectly and imperfectly competitive product markets. We also discuss how optimal trade policy is shaped by the presence of multiple sectors, intermediate goods, and supply-chain linkages. We close the chapter by discussing the scope of future research.\n\n",
