Corporate Investment with Financial Constraints: Sensitivity of
Investment to Funds from Voluntary Asset Sales

NBER Working Paper No. 9432
January 2003
JEL No. G31, G32, G34
ABSTRACT
This paper examines the importance of financial constraints for firm investment expenditures
by looking at the relationship between investment expenditures and proceeds from voluntary asset
sales in financially healthy US manufacturing companies. Specifically, we examine whether asset
sales have a greater influence on investment expenditures for firms that are likely to be financially
constrained. Asset sales may provide a cleaner indicator of liquidity than cash flow since it appears
not to be positively correlated with future investment opportunities. The cross-sectional differences
in firm investment expenditures are examined using an endogenous switching regression model with
unknown sample separation, which does not require an a priori classification of firms or knowledge
of their financial constraints. We find that after controlling for investment opportunities and cash
generated from operations, cash obtained from asset sales is a significant determinant of corporate
investment. Moreover, the sensitivity of investment to proceeds from asset sales is significantly
stronger for firms that are likely to be associated with characteristics associated with financial
constraints.

1. Introduction
There is a growing literature that suggests that because of information asymmetries and
capital market imperfections, corporate investment expenditures are strongly influenced by a
firm’s ability to internally generate cash flow. Consistent with the view that the correlation
between investment expenditures and cash flows is due to financing constraints, researchers have
found that the sensitivity of investment expenditures to cash flows are much stronger for firms
that are likely to be financially constrained [Fazzari, Hubbard, and Petersen (1988), Hoshi,
Kashyap, and Scharfstein (1988), Whited (1992), Gilchrist and Himmelberg (1995), Hubbard
(1998), and other].
Recent papers by Kaplan and Zingales (1997) and Cleary (1999) question the
interpretation advanced by the previous studies and suggest that the sensitivity of firm investment
to internal capital might be caused by other factors that have been overlooked. Specifically, they
report that the sensitivity of investment to cash flows is the lowest for firms that they classify as
being the most likely to be financially constrained. Fazzari, Hubbard, and Petersen (2000), in a
reply to Kaplan and Zingales (1997), take issue with their interpretation on a number of
dimensions. In particular, they question the use of qualitative managerial statements about the
firm’s financial status and suggest that the Kaplan and Zingales (1997) as well as the Cleary
(1999) methodology tend to classify financially distressed firms as being financially constrained.
To a large extent this controversy arises because of difficulties associated with measuring
investment opportunities. If investment opportunities are not measured appropriately, then cash
flows, in addition to conveying information about internal liquidity, may also reflect information
about future investment opportunities that are not captured by proxies for q.

Since the

measurement of q incorporates firm market value, this effect is likely to be more severe for firms
suffering from problems of information asymmetry, which are also the firms that are most likely

1

to be financially constrained. As a result, we might expect higher estimated coefficients of cash
flow in investment regressions for firms a priori classified as financially constrained.
There have been a number of approaches to resolve this problem. One of them is to
identify shifts in firms’ internal funds that are uncorrelated with shifts in investment opportunities
[e.g., Lamont (1997), Hubbard, Kashyap, and Whited (1995), and Fazzari and Petersen (1993)].
In general, the results suggest that investment is positively related with firms’ internal sources of
capital that are uncorrelated with their future profitability.
This study provides further evidence along these lines by exploring the relationship
between funds obtained from voluntary divestitures and firm investment expenditures. Cash
obtained from asset sales seems to be an appropriate variable for this purpose for a number of
reasons. First, in contrast to the cash flow variables used in prior studies, cash obtained from
voluntary divestitures is not likely to be positively related to the firm’s investment opportunities.
For example, the sale of assets not related to a firm’s core operations is unlikely to convey
information about the growth opportunities of the firm’s remaining lines of business. Moreover,
the sale of assets from a firm’s core business may indicate that the selling firm’s growth
opportunities are unfavorable, which would bias the results against finding a liquidity effect.1
Second, asset sales may increase the amount of funds under the managers’ discretion without the
monitoring that arises with a public securities offering.
The prior literature provides two motivations for why financially healthy firms undertake
voluntary asset sell-offs.

The first is that voluntary asset sales allow firms to restructure

operations to achieve higher operating efficiencies by selling assets to more productive users or
by selling assets that have negative synergies with the sellers’ core businesses [Hite, Owers, and
Rogers (1987) and John and Ofek (1995)].

With this motivation, asset sales are likely to

1

Cash obtained from asset sales is also free of another possible caveat of cash flow. Kaplan and Zingales
(1997) raise a concern that in firms where cash flow and investment grow at a rate similar to that of sales,
investment-cash flow sensitivities are biased towards one. They further argue that this effect is stronger for
firms with higher annual growth rates that tend to be classified as financially constrained.

2

influence investment expenditures only for firms that are in some way financially constrained.
Financial constraints may also be the motivation for asset sales.

Asset sales are privately

negotiated transactions and may represent a less costly means of raising capital than public issues
of debt and equity for those firms facing information problems.

Therefore, financially

constrainted firms may sell assets to raise cash for alternative investments [Lang, Poulsen, and
Stulz (1995)]. In either case, we expect to see a much stronger relation between asset sales and
investment for financially constrained firms.
To test this hypothesis we estimate a switching regression model with unknown sample
separation to examine cross-sectional differences in investment-asset sales sensitivity.

This

method avoids the necessity of a priori knowledge of whether or not a firm is financially
constrained. Rather, the likelihood of a firm demonstrating investment behavior, consistent with
financial constraints, is endogenously determined by multiple firm characteristics.
We find that after controlling for investment opportunities and cash flows, cash from
asset sales is a significant determinant of corporate investment expenditures.

Moreover, the

estimates of the switching regression model indicate that the sensitivity of investment to both
asset sales and cash flows is related to variables that are likely to be related to financial
constraints. In particular, firms that are larger, older, have lower market-to-book ratios, lower
levels of financial slack, have bond ratings and are more likely to pay out dividends demonstrate
significantly lower sensitivity of investment to asset sales and internal funds.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 defines the variables and describes the sample
and data. Section 3 explains the econometric methods and presents the empirical results for
investment regressions on the full sample. Section 4 presents the evidence on cross-sectional
differences in investment behavior based on the estimation of a switching regression model.
Section 5 provides our conclusions.

2. Data and Variables
2.1 Sample and Data
Our sample includes manufacturing firms (SIC codes between 2000 and 3999) listed on
the NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ firms from the COMPUSTAT research file. This data file
includes firms that no longer exist, so that there is no survival bias. However, we do restrict our
sample in two ways. First, since we examine the relation between asset sales and investment, we
consider only firms that have sold fixed assets during the sample period. Second, since we are
primarily interested in the effect of financial constraints rather than financial distress, we exclude
all financially distressed firm-years from the sample.
Prior studies have shown that distressed and healthy firms sell assets for very different
reasons [Ofek (1993), Asquith, Gertner, Scharfstein (1994), Brown, James, and Mooradian
(1994)]. In particular, a marginal dollar of cash flow from asset sales is less likely to be invested
if a firm is in financial distress. Inclusion of distressed firms in the sample would thus bias the
results against finding a relationship between firm investment and internal capital. In addition,
classifying distressed firms as constrained may falsely indicate that the sensitivity of investment
to internal capital is weaker in firms that are more likely to be constrained [Fazzari, Hubbard,
Petersen (2000)]. Our definition of financial distress is based on interest coverage ratios as in
Asquith, Gertner, and Scharfstein (1994). A firm is classified as financially distressed in a given
year if the firm’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) is less
than 80 percent of its interest expense in one year or if EBITDA is less than the interest expense
for two consecutive years.
The sample includes all the firm-years with complete data on the required variables
during the period from 1977 to 2000. Because of the need to create both lagged and lead
variables, the actual tests are estimated for the period from 1980 to 1999. The final sample used
in estimating the regressions consists of an unbalanced panel dataset of 9,751 firm-years and
1,474 firms. The number of observations for each company varies between 1 and 20. The

4

sample does not have a survival requirement and includes a substantial number of firms that no
longer exist.
The sample includes firms from a wide range of size distribution measured by the book
value of their total assets and capital. Unlike other studies, we are not imposing a size restriction
on asset sale transactions in a given year. All qualifying firm-years are included in the sample
irrespective of the size of divestitures in a given year. As a result, the average asset sales
transaction is a much smaller percentage of fixed assets compared to those reported in previous
studies. For example, Brown, James, and Mooradian (1993) and John and Ofek (1994) report
average transaction prices of 14% and 40% of book value of assets, respectively. In our sample,
assets are sold in 7,733 out of 9,751 firm-years, and the average transaction size for those
observations is 3.2% of capital.

Another reason for such a difference between sizes of

divestitures is that we measure asset sales only by the amount of cash obtained in exchange for
the assets while other studies use the total proceeds that may combine cash and exchanged
securities. Since some of our tests are conducted for the 80’s and the 90’s separately, we also
report statistics for the two subperiods separately.

2.2 The Model and the Variables
Our empirical specification can be summarized as follows:
Investmentit = f(growth oppt, liquidity, assets sales, control variables)+ εit

(1)

where i refers to the company, t refers to the time period and investment is measured as the
capital expenditures made by a firm during the year. Growth opportunities are proxied by
market-to-book ratio, which is calculated as the ratio of the market value of equity plus the book
value of total debt to the book value of total assets at the beginning of each period. To measure
internally generated liquidity, we include both flow and stock measures. Specifically, we include
cash flow, measured as the sum of the income before extraordinary items and depreciation and
amortization during the year, and financial slack, measured as the sum of cash and marketable

5

securities held by a firm at the beginning of each year.
The amount of cash from asset sales is included as an additional source of liquidity. The
asset sales information, taken from the companies’ flow of funds statements (Compustat
item107), includes the amount of cash obtained from sale of property, plant, and equipment. It
understates the total value of sold assets since it measures only cash proceeds from asset sales and
does not include the value of divested assets in exchange for equity or debt. Investment is
measured by capital expenditures (Compustat item 128), which also includes only the amount of
cash spent on investment and not the value of total investment. These measures are more
appropriate for the purpose of this study, since we are concerned about constraints associated
with raising external cash. All the flow variables and financial slack are scaled by the book value
of the beginning-of-period net fixed assets. Finally, in order to control for both effects of
leverage in firm investment, we use the coverage ratio, which is calculated as the interest expense
divided by EBITDA, in the investment regression and short-term and long-term leverage ratios in
cross-sectional regressions.2 In order to reduce the impact of outliers, the regression variables
with extreme observations are winsorized. Descriptive statistics of the variables included in our
regressions are presented in Table 1.
Table 2 presents the correlations between the variables. The Table reveals a very strong
positive correlation between cash flow and growth opportunities measured by the market-to-book
ratios, suggesting that the sensitivity of investment to cash flow may be attributed to information
about future profitability that is not captured by the market-to-book ratios. In contrast, the
correlation coefficient between asset sale proceeds and the market-to-book ratios is negative and
significant, which suggests that firms with greater levels of asset sales may have poorer

2

Lang, Ofek, and Stulz (1996) argue that investment should be negatively related to leverage because high
leverage reduces the current funds available for investment and affects the firm’s ability to raise additional
funds due to reasons discussed by Myers (1977) and Jensen and Meckling (1976). They provide evidence
that for firms with unattractive growth opportunities investment is significantly negatively related to
leverage.

investment opportunities.

3. Sensitivity of Investment to Funds from Asset Sales
The first set of tests is based on estimating the model on the full sample. We estimate a
least squares regression using first differences for all variables and year dummies in order to
control for fixed firm and year effects. We estimate the model on the 20-year sample and for the
two ten-year periods of the 80’s and the 90’s. Both current and lagged values of all independent
variables and the lagged value of the dependent variable are included in the model.
The regression results are presented in Table 3. As in previous studies, investment is
positively related to both flow and stock measures of internal cash.

In all regressions,

contemporaneous and lagged cash flow and the beginning-of-period financial slack are significant
determinants of investment. Beginning-of-year investment opportunities play a very important
role, too, but with a small coefficient as in most previous studies. Consistent with the findings of
Lang, Ofek, and Stulz (1996), firms with higher levels of interest expense relative to their income
invest significantly less.
The results also show that there is a strong positive relation between the amount of cash
from divestitures and corporate investment.

A divestiture and use of its proceeds for

reinvestment may not happen in the same year. A firm may sell assets and reinvest the proceeds
in the following year or it may make an investment planning a divestiture in the following year.
In order to consider all these possibilities, we include both positively and negatively lagged asset
sales along with current assets sales in the model. The results show that asset sales in the current,
previous and the following year have a significant positive effect on investment.
The main result of the first set of regressions is that after controlling for growth
opportunities, corporate investment is significantly correlated with both cash flows and funds
obtained from divestitures. Our hypothesis is that since asset sales is less likely to be positively
related to growth opportunities, the sensitivity of investment to asset sales is likely to be driven

7

by financing constraints. To explore this hypothesis further we conduct cross-sectional tests.

4. Cross-Sectional Differences in Investment
4.1 Endogenous Switching Regression Model with Unknown Sample Separation
If asset sales are associated with investment expenditures because of financing
constraints, then the observed sensitivity of investment to funds raised from asset sales should
vary cross-sectionally.

In particular, it should be higher when firms are more financially

constrained. Most of the prior studies have used the following method for estimating the crosssectional differences in firms’ investment behavior.

Firms or firm-years are classified into

subgroups based on certain firm characteristics or qualitative information assumed to reflect the
degree of financial constraints, and separate investment regressions are estimated for each
subgroup.
This method assumes that the points of sample separation are known.

In reality,

however, the extent of financial constraints faced by a firm is not directly observable. We expect
that some firms face greater financial constraints than others, but we cannot perfectly identify
these firms ex ante. An exception would be, for example, the case of Japanese firms studied in
Hoshi, Kashyap, Scharfstein (1991), where the affiliation of a firm with a keiretsu is directly
observed. In most other cases, the threshold values of firm characteristics used for sample
separation are based on judgment calls. This implies that the results of estimation of investment
regressions on different samples may be sensitive to the choice of the criterion and the
breakpoints used for sample splits. This may be one of the reasons for the conflicting findings in
the existing literature, especially if the relationship between financial constraints and investmentcash flow sensitivity is non-monotonic, as argued by Kaplan and Zingales (1997).
We use an endogenous switching regression model with unknown sample separation [see
Maddala and Nelson (1994) and Maddala (1986)], which was previously used to estimate cash
flow sensitivities in Hu and Schiantarelli (1997). This approach provides estimates of separate

8

investment regressions without a priori classifying firms as constrained or unconstrained. It is
based on the assumption that the number of different regimes in which firms operate is known,
but the points of structural change are not observable. The advantage of this approach is that the
extent that investment behavior differs across groups of firms and the characteristics that make
firms more likely to demonstrate higher or lower sensitivity are determined simultaneously.
We assume that there are two different investment regimes. In one regime, investment
may be more sensitive to the availability of internal funds than in the other regime.

We

hypothesize that these differences reflect the extent of financial constraints faced by firms.
Depending on the extent of liquidity constraints a firm may operate in one of the two
unobservable investment regimes.
The model is composed of the following system of three equations that are estimated
simultaneously:
I1it = Xitβ1 + u1it

(2)

I2it = Xitβ2 + u2it

(3)

yit* = Zitγ + εit.

(4)

Equations (2) and (3) are the structural equations that describe the investment behavior of
firms in the alternative regimes. Equation (4) is the selection equation that determines a firm’s
“propensity” of being in one or the other investment regime. The observed investment, Iit,
undertaken by firm i at time t, , is defined as

Iit = I1it iff yit* < 0
Iit = I2it iff yit* ≥ 0.

9

(5)

In (2) and (3), Xit are the determinants of corporate investment and Zit are the
determinants of a firms’ likelihood of being in the first or the second investment regime at time t.

β1, β2, and γ are vectors of parameters, yi* is a latent variable measuring the tendency or the
likelihood of being in the first or the second regime, u1, u2, and ε are residuals. Firms are not
fixed in one regime. As described by (5), a transfer between the regimes occurs if yi* reaches a
certain unobservable “threshold” value. This is important since a firm’s financial status may
change over time, leading to a significant change in its investment behavior.
We assume that u1, u2, and ε are jointly normally distributed with mean vector 0 and

 σ 11 σ 12 σ 1ε 


covariance matrix Σ =  σ 12 σ 22 σ 2 ε  .


 σ 1ε σ 2 ε 1 

This assumption permits a nonzero correlation

between the shocks to investment and the shocks to firms’ characteristics and endogenous
switching between the two investment behaviors. Note, that var(ε) is normalized to 1 because, in
(4), we can estimate only γ/σε , but not γ and σε, individually. Since σ12 does not appear in (7), it
is not estimable.
The switching regression approach allows us to control for multiple indicators that jointly
determine the group in which a firm is likely to belong without the need for splitting the sample
into many smaller parts or including many interaction terms. The number of indicators used to
split the samples or create interaction terms is usually limited to one or two. However, single
factor classifications may not successfully separate firms with different sensitivity of investment
to internal financing. The severity of financial constraints often varies among firms of the same
subgroup because of other factors that are not controlled for. Multiple factor classifications, on
the other hand, increase the number of subsamples reducing the size of each group used for
estimation or increase the number of interactive terms in single regressions and produce
imprecise estimates.

The estimation of the selection equation also allows us to assess the

statistical significance of the factors assumed to proxy for the degree of liquidity constraints faced

10

by a firm. Besides, the selection regression, which directly includes the firm characteristics,
incorporates more information into the estimation of the separate investment regimes than the
creation of dummy variables or sample splits.
The model is estimated by the method of Maximum Likelihood. Although we do not
observe the tendency of a firm being in one or the other investment regime, we know that if

εit < - Zitγ, the firm’s investment is determined by (2), and if yit* > 0 or, equivalently,
εit > - Zitγ, the firm’s investment is determined by (3). The likelihood function for each
observation is given by

lit = Pr ( εit < − Zγ u1it = I 1it − Xitβ 1) Pr (u1it = I 1it − Xitβ 1) +
+ Pr ( εit > − Zγ u2it = I 2it − Xitβ 2) Pr (u 2it = I 2it − Xitβ 2) .

The Maximum Likelihood estimates of β1, β2, γ, σ’s can be obtained using numerical
maximization techniques. It is possible to test for the existence of two different investment
regimes by performing a likelihood ratio test with the log-likelihood values for OLS and the
switching model. If β1 is equal to β2, and σ1ε is equal to σ2ε then u1 is equal to u2 and the
likelihood function reduces to a standard normal density. We conduct this test later.

4.2 Criteria of Sample Separation

11

4.2.1 Size
One of the most widely used proxy variables for the level of financial constraints is firm
size [Devereux and Schiantarelli (1990), Oliner and Rudebusch (1992)]. Smaller firms are likely
to be financially constrained for a number of reasons. First, empirical evidence shows that
transaction costs of new issues decrease with the issue size. This makes external funds relatively
more expensive for small firms. Second, small firms get less analyst coverage and may thus have
less access to external sources of capital because of adverse selection problems [Myers and
Majluf (1984)]. Third, large firms can raise debt more easily because they are more diversified
and less prone to bankruptcy. Thus, higher sensitivity of investment to internal capital in small
firms will support the hypothesis that financial constraints lead to underinvestment.
Previous empirical tests of a financial constraint size effect report mixed results
[Schiantarelli (1996)]. When size is applied to large datasets with a wide range of firm sizes, the
results seem to support the hypothesis that small firms face much higher costs of raising external
funds than do large firms. However, results for smaller samples of relatively large firms show
either higher sensitivity of investment to changes in cash flow for larger firms or no significant
differences between size groups. One possible explanation for such evidence is that different
sampling criteria may create a bias towards selecting only those small firms that have been
successful and less liquidity constrained.
Our sample may suffer from a similar selection bias. First, we are using only quoted
firms. Second, we are eliminating distressed firm-years. The number of distressed firm-years
and observations with missing values is likely to be higher among smaller firms. Thus our
sampling criteria may exclude more small firms than large firms. However, we do include firms
that are no longer in existence. We also impose a less strict restriction on the minimum required
number of years of record. This is likely to mitigate to some extent the selection bias against
small firms.

12

We measure size as the natural logarithm of the book value of assets at the beginning of
each period adjusted for inflation.
4.2.2 Age
Similar to size, firm age may proxy for the wedge between the costs of external and
internal capital [Devereux and Schiantarelli (1990), Oliner and Rudebusch (1992)]. Younger and
growing firms are more likely to be financially constrained. Age is proxied by the natural
logarithm of the number of years a firm has been listed on NYSE, AMEX or OTC.
4.2.3 Leverage
As argued by Lang, Ofek, and Stulz (1996), leverage may negatively affect firm
investment in a number of ways.

First, it may reduce the amount of cash available for

investment. Second, due to reasons discussed by Myers (1977) or Jensen and Meckling (1976),
highly levered firms may face higher hurdles in accessing external sources of capital. To control
for both effects separately we include two measures of leverage in the selection equation--the
ratio of short-term debt over the book value of assets and the ratio of long-term debt over the
book value of assets.
4.2.4 Financial Slack
Financial slack may be associated with financial constraints for two reasons. Some have
argued that firms with ample cash reserves are not liquidity constrained since their investment is
not limited by a lack of finance [Kaplan and Zingales (1997), Kashyap, Lamont, and Stein
(1994)]. Others, however, suggest that high levels of financial slack indicate that these firms are
more financially constrained [Calomiris, Himmelberg, and Wachtel (1996), Fazzari, Hubbard,
and Petersen (1996), Kim, Mauer, and Sherman (1998)], since constrained firms have more
incentive to hold large cash balances. For example, Calomiris, Himmelberg, and Wachtel (1996)
find that firms with low or no credit quality ratings tend to hold larger stocks of liquid assets and
demonstrate higher sensitivity of investment to cash flow.
4.2.5 Market-to-Book Ratio

13

Firms with high growth opportunities have greater need for external financing, and,
therefore, may be more liquidity constrained. At the same time, a high market-to-book ratio may
indicate that the firm’s growth opportunities are recognized by the market, which implies that,
other things equal, firms with higher market-to-book ratios will have easier access to external
funds.
4.2.6 Dummy Variables for Dividend Payout and Bond Rating
We also include a dummy variable, which is equal to one if a firm paid out dividends in
the year prior to the investment and zero, otherwise, and a dummy variable which is equal to one
if a firm has bond rating by the Standard & Poors. Firms that pay out dividends are expected to
be less liquidity constrained and firms that have bond rating are expected to have easier access to
external capital markets.

4.3 Results of Estimation of the Switching Model
The switching regression model with unknown separation is estimated by the method of
Maximum Likelihood using numerical maximization techniques. In order to account for firmspecific fixed effects, the investment regressions are estimated in first differences, and year
dummies are included in the investment regression to control for fixed year effects. We estimate
the model for the entire 20-year period and its two 10-year subperiods of 1980-89 and 1990-99.
Table 4 reports the results of the estimation of the switching regression model for the 20year sample. The estimates of the two investment regressions, presented in Panel A, demonstrate
that the firms’ investment behavior is significantly different in the two regimes. This difference
is especially apparent for asset sales. In both regimes, investment is positively and significantly
related to cash flow and the stock of cash. Although there are statistically significant differences
in these coefficient estimates, they are roughly of the same magnitude. In contrast, the coefficient
of the contemporaneous asset sales variable is about eight times larger in the constrained regime,
and the leads and lags of this variable is significant only in the constrained regime. In addition,

14

the coverage ratio has a significantly stronger negative effect on investment for firms operating in
the second investment regime, where investment is more sensitive to internal liquidity and asset
sales. The coefficients of growth opportunities are not significantly different between the two
regimes.
The estimates of the selection equation, presented in Panel B, reveal that six of the
selection characteristics play an important role in determining the likelihood of a firm being in a
particular investment regime. The estimates indicate that firms that are larger, older, have lower
levels of financial slack, lower market-to-book ratio, are more likely to pay dividends and have
bond rating are likely to operate in investment regime 1. The estimates in the investment
equation are consistent with regime 1 being the unconstrained regime, which is consistent with
our intuition about the characteristics of firms that are likely to be constrained.
The estimates of the same model for the 1980-89 and 1990-99 decades are reported in
Tables 5 and 6, respectively. Overall, the findings are consistent with those reported in Table 4.
As shown in Panel A of Tables 5 and 6, firms operating in the first investment regime
demonstrate lower sensitivity to all the three measures of liquidity. However, the differences in
sensitivities are much more dramatic for asset sales.

Unlike the previous results, growth

opportunities are more important for firms that operate in the first investment regime in the
decade of 1980-89 and become less important for the same kind of firms in the decade of 199099. Panels B present the results of the selection equation. As before, firms that are larger, older,
have lower market-to-book ratio, lower financial slack, and are more likely to pay dividends are
more likely to operate in the first investment regime where investment is less sensitive to internal
funds and asset sales. Long-term leverage is significantly negative in the results for the 80’s
indicating that firms with lower leverage are less dependent on internally generated cash. It
becomes positive and marginally significant in the 90’s.
The existence of two distinct investment regimes can be tested with a likelihood ratio
test. The problem with a switching model is that under the restriction that the coefficients of the

15

two investment regimes are equal, the parameters of the selection equation are not identified
which complicates the calculation of degrees of freedom. It is also possible that the asymptotic
likelihood ratio statistic does not have a χ2 distribution. We rely on the results of the Monte Carlo
tests conducted by Goldfeld and Quandt (1976), suggesting that the χ2 distribution can be used to
conduct a likelihood ratio test by defining the degrees of freedom as the sum of the number of
constraints and the number of unidentified parameters. The calculations for our model yield 57
degrees of freedom. Given the critical value for the χ2 distribution at the 1 percent level with 57
degrees of freedom, we can easily reject the possibility of similar investment behavior by all
firms at any conventional level of significance for both estimated specifications. Two distinct
investment regimes describe the data significantly better than one regime.

6. Conclusion
This paper examines the relation between proceeds from voluntary asset sales and firm
investment using an extension of the q model of investment. The evidence suggests that funds
from voluntary divestitures provide an important financing source for financially constrained
firms. Specifically, firms invest more when they generate cash from asset sales and the extent to
which they do this tends to be related to firm characteristics that are likely to be associated with
financial constraints.
The findings in this paper provide strong evidence that cross-sectional differences in
financing constraints have significant effects on corporate investment expenditures.

This

evidence is consistent with a substantial literature on financial constraints that focuses on the
sensitivities of investment expenditures to cash flows. The existing literature, however, has been
criticized because cash flows are likely to measure investment opportunities as well as corporate
liquidity. Our tests, therefore, provide an important contribution to this debate because it is
unlikely that asset sales would be strongly related to investment opportunities.

16

Although our analysis suggests that financing constraints at least partially explain why
firms invest more when they sell assets, we do not explain the causal relation between these two
variables. One possibility is that financially constrained firms take on existing positive NPV
projects that they would have otherwise passed up when they receive the proceeds from an
unrelated asset sale. Another possibility is that financially constrained firms choose to finance
new investment opportunities by selling assets. Both explanations require financial constraints,
however, the direction of causation between asset sales and investment is very different.
Although it is likely that in reality both explanations are important, this should probably be
considered in future research.
Future research should probably also consider other explanations for the relation between
investment expenditures and asset sales. Perhaps, this relationship arises because firms are
constrained in ways that have nothing to do with capital.

For example, firms may have only

limited amounts of managerial time and are thus forced to eliminate a line of business before they
can add a more promising line of business. While this explanation is plausible, one would have to
argue that the firm characteristics that appear to be associated with financing constraints are really
measuring managerial constraints. This is unlikely, but probably should be considered in future
work.

Table 1
Descriptive statistics for 1,474 financially healthy US manufacturing firms that sold fixed assets
for cash proceeds at least once over the period 1980-99. Investment is measured as capital
expenditures. Cash flow is the sum of income before extraordinary items and depreciation and
amortization. Asset sales is equal to the cash proceeds received from sale of fixed capital.
Growth opportunities (M/B) is equal to the sum of the book value of total debt and market value
of equity divided by the book value of total assets. Financial slack is the sum of cash and shortterm investments. Investment, cash flow, asset sales, and financial slack are deflated by the book
value of the beginning-of-period net fixed assets (K). Total assets and net capital are measured in
million dollars. Total assets, net capital, and leverage ratios are measured at the beginning of
each year. The number of observations for all variables is 9,751 for 1980-99, 4,919 for 1980-89,
and 4,832 for 1990-99.

Correlation coefficients between the variables used in investment regressions for a sample of 1,474 US manufacturing firms. Investment is equal
to capital expenditures. Cash flow is the sum of income before extraordinary items and depreciation and amortization. Asset sales is equal to the
cash proceeds received from sale of fixed capital. Growth opportunities is equal to the sum of the book value of total debt and market value of
equity divided by the book value of total assets. Financial slack is the sum of cash and short-term investments. Investment, cash flow, asset sales,
and financial slack are deflated by the book value of the beginning-of-period net fixed assets. There are 9,751 observations for each variable.

The dependent variable is coded 1 for the first investment regime and 0 for the second investment
regime. A positive coefficient means that firms with a high value of the selection variable are
more likely to be in the first regime. The book value of assets is estimated in 1980 US dollars.
Age is the number of years of a firm has been listed on NYSE, AMEX or OTC. Financial slack
includes cash and short-term investments and is deflated by the beginning-of-period net fixed
assets. Growth opportunities is equal to the sum of the book value of total debt and market value
of equity divided by the book value of total assets.
