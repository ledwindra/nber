ABSTRACT
This paper estimates the impact of social health insurance on financial risk reduction by utilizing
data from a natural experiment created by the phased roll out of a social health insurance program
for the poor in India. We estimate the impact of insurance on the distribution of out-of-pocket
costs, frequency and amount of money borrowed for health reasons, and the likelihood of
incurring catastrophic health expenditures. We use a stylized expected utility model to compute
the welfare effects associated with changes due to insurance in the distribution of out-of-pocket
costs. We adjust the standard model to account for the unique conditions of a developing country
by incorporating consumption floors, informal borrowing, and selling of assets. These
adjustments allow us to estimate the value of financial risk reduction from both consumption
smoothing and asset protection channels. Our results show that social insurance reduces out-ofpocket costs with larger effects in the higher quantiles of the out-of-pocket cost distribution. In
addition, we find a reduction in the frequency and amount of money borrowed for health reasons.
Finally, we find that the value of financial risk reduction outweighs the total per household cost
of the social insurance program by two to five times.

1. Introduction
Universal health coverage is an increasingly accepted international development goal. Several
developing countries are expanding government-funded health insurance to contribute to this goal as it
provides a way to spread financial risk across taxpayers. In theory, health insurance coverage can
improve welfare through two channels: improvements in health and reductions in financial risk due to
lower out of pocket expenses. Studies examining the effects of access to health insurance in developing
countries on financial risk protection have overwhelmingly focused on its impact on either average outof-pocket health expenditure or on the incidence of catastrophic health expenditure. 1 These studies
often rely on nationally representative cross-sectional surveys and the findings from this literature are
mixed. While many papers report a decline in out-of-pocket health expenses, this finding is not
consistent across all countries and all programs (Saksena, Hsu, & Evans, 2014; Van Doorslaer et al., 2007;
Xu et al., 2007). Acharya et al. (2012) provide a review, documenting studies that show a decline in outof-pocket expenditures due to social health insurance, others that show a rise in out-of-pocket
expenditures, and still others that found no impact on out-of-pocket expenditures (Acharya et al., 2012).
More recently, Miller et al. (2009) compared distributions of out-of-pocket payments associated
with eligibility for insurance in Colombia and find a lower distribution for inpatient payments associated
with insurance, with the largest differences concentrated at the right tail of the distribution. There was
no difference in the outpatient payment distributions (Miller, Pinto, & Vera-Hernández, 2009). Similarly,
Bernal et al. (2014) compare cost distributions across eligibility to access social insurance in Peru.
However, they find that eligibility is associated with increased out-of-pocket payments at the higher end
of the distribution (Bernal, Carpio, & Klein, 2014). Thus, the impact of social insurance across the
distribution of out-of-pocket expenses is poorly understood in developing economies. Some studies
have also examined the welfare impact of insurance due to consumption smoothing by combining
estimates of change in out-of-pocket cost distributions due to insurance with a stylized expected utility
model. For example, Finkelstein and McKnight (2008) study the impact of the introduction of Medicare
in the United States in 1965 and find that the welfare gains from consumption smoothing covered
between half and three quarters of the costs of the program (Finkelstein & McKnight, 2008). This

Catastrophic health expenditure is conceptually defined as out-of-pocket spending greater than the household’s
capacity to pay; empirically, health expenditure can be defined as catastrophic if it is greater than 40% of the
household’s non-subsistence expenditure or greater than 10% of the household’s total expenditure (Ranson, 2002;
Xu et al., 2003).

method of quantifying changes in financial risk due to universal health insurance has also been applied
to developing countries; Limwattananon et al. (2015) compare data from Thailand on households
benefiting from improved social health insurance coverage with households experiencing no change due
to pre-existing coverage (for civil servants). They conclude that the improvement in insurance coverage
had significant value for eligible households (Limwattananon et al., 2015). Additionally, Barofsky (2011)
uses experimental data from Seguro Popular, a health insurance scheme in Mexico, and finds that
welfare gains due to consumption smoothing cover roughly a quarter of program costs (Barofsky, 2011).
In this paper, we contribute to the literature on measuring financial risk reduction due to social
health insurance by estimating the distributional effects of access to health insurance on out-of-pocket
spending for below poverty line households in Karnataka, India. We use the standard quantile regression
estimator presented by Koenker and Basset (1978) to predict changes in out-of-pocket payments
conditional on having made such payments. Next, we use the three step censored quantile regression
estimator developed by Chernozukhov and Hong (2002) to model the unconditional distribution of
spending. We find that social insurance lowers the distribution of health care costs with larger effects at
the right tail of the distribution.
In our welfare analysis, we explicitly account for a number of features specific to developing
countries. Households in developing countries rely on a wide range of risk-mitigating strategies to deal
with health shocks in the absence of market mechanisms (such as formal insurance) to manage risk
(Gertler & Gruber, 2002; Morduch, 1995). For example, households may self-insure and dis-save from
their assets to smooth consumption (Rosenzweig & Wolpin, 1993). Alternatively, they may depend upon
village networks (borrowing within the same village) or social networks (borrowing within caste groups).
If informal insurance helps smooth consumption, this would suggest that the gain from social health
insurance may be relatively small as it would crowd out existing informal insurance mechanisms.
However, Chetty and Looney (2006) argue that observed small fluctuations in consumption in
developing countries may in fact hide very high welfare costs as poor households struggle to meet the
costs of shocks (Chetty & Looney, 2006). For example, very poor households may take severe measures,
such as selling productive assets or borrowing from a moneylender, in order to avoid their consumption
dropping below subsistence. The existing stylized models for valuing health insurance do not capture
these possible mechanisms that may feature in developing countries.

3

We extend the stylized choice model used to measure financial risk by incorporating a number
of features that may be specific to developing countries. We incorporate a consumption floor to account
for limited ability to cut back on consumption below a subsistence level. We also explicitly account for
informal insurance in the model and allow households to sell assets to self-insure against high health
care costs. Thus, we are able to capture the impact of insurance on both consumption smoothing and
asset protection. We use plausibly exogenous variation in insurance coverage by exploiting a geographic
discontinuity in the eligibility of a government-funded health insurance scheme, the Vajpayee
Arogyashree Scheme (VAS), that provided coverage for expenses related to catastrophic illness to poor
households in Karnataka, India. We find that the value of financial risk protection from insurance
outweighs the average per household social costs of the insurance program by two to five times.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss details of the health sector
focusing on social health insurance and the VAS program in the state of Karnataka. In Section 3, we
describe the natural experiment and the out-of-pocket health expenditure distributions. In section 4, we
discuss the two-part censored quantile regression model that we use to model the distribution of outof-pocket costs. In Section 5, we present our extension of the standard stylized choice model to
incorporate features of a developing economy and present estimates of the value of insurance. Section
6 concludes by juxtaposing the value of insurance due to financial risk reduction with the cost of the
program as well as the value of insurance stemming from improvements in health.

2. Background: Social Health Insurance in Karnataka
World Bank indicators state that between 2011 and 2015, health expenditure in India represented
4% of gross domestic product (GDP) and public expenditure on health was about 1.3% of GDP. These
numbers have been steady for many years; for example, between 2001 and 2005 total health
expenditure in India was 3.8% of GDP and public expenditure on health was about 1.1% of GDP.
Approximately 70% of health care in India is procured through out-of-pocket purchases rather than
through pooled financing mechanisms, such as formal health insurance (public or private) or, more
importantly in India, the government funded health system. In the state of Karnataka, where VAS was
rolled out in 2010, 73% of all hospitalizations in 2014 were reported to be in private institutions. This
proportion was 82% among the urban population. (Government of India, 2015) A 2011-12 survey found
that among the rural population in Karnataka, average medical expenses were 7.8% of total
consumption expenditures, while among the urban population this proportion was 4.5% (Government
of India, 2013a). This suggests that many households in Karnataka (and in India more generally) face
4

large expenses in financing health care. Shahrawat and Rao (2012) use data from 2004 and find that
about 5.8% of rural households and 3.21% of urban households faced catastrophic health expenditures
(defined as out-of-pocket payments for health care that exceeded 40% of their total non-food
consumption) (Shahrawat & Rao, 2012).
Although private health insurance coverage is growing among better-off households, the poor in
India have little or no access to such formal market-based mechanisms to pool risk, so that households
rely on individual and community-specific risk management strategies. Prior research shows that,
among the rural population in India, 40% of out-of-pocket health expenditures were met by borrowing:
13% from contributions from social networks and 5% from sale of household assets (Shahrawat & Rao,
2012). Morduch and Rutherford (2003) review a number of empirical papers to show that such
mechanisms rarely provide complete coverage (Morduch & Rutherford, 2003). These gaps in informal
insurance not only retard income growth possibilities but may lead to poverty traps (Zimmerman &
Carter, 2003). Estimates of the extent to which health shocks lead to poverty are difficult when the only
reliable data is consumption expenditure, as is the case in India. A counter-intuitive implication of risk
coping behaviors is that they would inflate consumption expenditure, and so, push households above
the poverty line, reducing the measured incidence of poverty. Using data from India, Flores et al. (2008)
develop a coping-adjusted health expenditure to total consumption ratio to show that ignoring out-ofpocket healthcare costs leads to an underestimate of poverty by 7-8% among households that face a
hospitalization. They estimate 80% of this is due to risk mitigating behavior by households reflecting that
household level adjustment is a commonly used response in developing countries (Flores, Krishnakumar,
O'Donnell, & Van Doorslaer, 2008).
With the main policy objective of providing protection for the poor against health care expenditures,
the central and several state governments in India have put in place a number of social health insurance
schemes covering inpatient hospital care (La Forgia & Nagpal, 2012). Some evidence suggests that these
programs have reduced out-of-pocket costs and borrowing to finance health care expenditures
(Aggarwal, 2010; Rao et al., 2014). The program we study, VAS, was launched by the state government
of Karnataka in 2010 in order to cover tertiary hospital services for households holding below poverty
line, or BPL, cards. At that time there were limited alternative schemes that could be used to access
catastrophic care in Karnataka. Yeshaswini, a cooperative based health insurance scheme, and Rastriya
Swasth Bima Yojana (RSBY), were such programs implemented in Karnataka but the former had limited
coverage of the poor while the latter did not cover tertiary care.
5

VAS reimburses hospitals based on a predefined price schedule for specific care packages covering
more than 450 tertiary care services in seven disease areas including cardiology, oncology, neurology,
nephrology, neonatology, burn care, and trauma care. Under VAS, hospitals need to meet infrastructure
requirements (such as having an intensive care unit) and staff requirements (such as having specialists
on staff) to be eligible to provide services to VAS beneficiaries (La Forgia & Nagpal, 2012). These
empaneled hospitals can be either public or private, and at the time of our study, most services were
provided by private hospitals. VAS beneficiaries are poor and most live in rural areas. Residents who
possess a BPL card issued by the state government are automatically enrolled in VAS and beneficiaries
pay no premiums or co-payments. Because most hospitals are located in urban centers in southern
Karnataka while beneficiaries are located in villages as far as several hundred miles away, empaneled
hospitals are required to organize health camps in rural areas to screen patients for tertiary care and
subsequently transport them to hospitals. Hospitals sign an agreement to conduct these health camps
during the empanelment process and receive a fixed payment per health camp conducted. Most rural
patients receiving care through VAS in 2012 were identified through these health camps. VAS was
originally rolled out in 2010 in northern Karnataka and expanded to the south only at the end of 2012.
The state of Karnataka is divided into four administrative divisions – Bangalore and Mysore divisions in
the south and Gulbarga and Belgaum divisions in the north. At the time of roll-out in 2010, the scheme
was initiated in the districts in northern part of the state and later expanded to the south. These
administrative divisions have been in place since the creation of the state in 1973 and the two divisions
in the north include districts with the lowest human development indicators (Government of Karnataka,
2002). Thus, access to VAS required possession of a BPL card and residency in any of the districts in the
two administrative divisions in north Karnataka. This creates a geographic discontinuity in access to the
VAS at the border of the two administrative divisions in the north with the two administrative divisions
in the south of Karnataka. This staggered roll-out created a natural experiment at the north-south
boundary that Sood et al. (2014) exploit to compare a population that had access to the scheme with an
equivalent population just south of the eligibility border that did not have access to the scheme (Sood et
al., 2014). Access to social health insurance was associated with significantly lower mortality rate for
conditions covered by VAS. Further, they reported lower out-of-pocket medical expenses for
hospitalizations in tertiary care hospitals related to covered conditions.

3. Data
We surveyed households in 300 villages just north of the eligibility border and 272 villages just
south side of the eligibility border (see Figure 1). The household survey asked respondents, usually the
head of household, about details on out-of-pocket health expenditures relating to all hospital
admissions and other details about household finances and demographic characteristics. In addition to
the household survey, we also conducted a survey of one community health worker (known as an Asha)
in each village to collect information on village level demographics, socioeconomic characteristics, and
health behaviors. The sample of villages on the south side was chosen to be representative of the
populations of Shimoga, Davangere, and Chitradurga, which are the northern-most districts of the
southern administrative region of Karnataka. Villages from the south side are matched with a sample of
villages (with replacement) from the VAS-eligible districts of Uttara Kannada, Haveri, and Bellary, on the
basis of variables from the 2001 Census. A propensity score matching algorithm was implemented prior
to collecting any data and was based on the census data. We use data on village population size,
demographic structure, sex ratio for children under age 6, scheduled caste and scheduled tribe, levels of
female literacy and population employed, to perform a nearest neighbor matching algorithm to match
villages on the north and the south of the VAS coverage border. Figure 2 presents histograms of the
estimated propensity score for villages covered by the program and those without the program
indicating substantial overlap and, thus, comparability.
The top panel of Table 1 presents summary statistics of our key covariates after nearest neighbor
matching on propensity scores and shows that there are no significant differences between villages with
and without insurance. Further, when we compare these villages on other dimensions not used in the
propensity score model we find few statistically observable differences between the groups. For
example, the lower panels of Table 1 use data from our surveys with community health workers to show
that these villages are comparable on multiple indicators, such as within village (un)healthy behaviors,
mortality levels, population wide, and for females, which were not available in our propensity score
model. One potentially important difference between our samples is bank access within a village. We
find that our sample from the south is more likely to have access than our sample in the north. While
this could be due to random chance, we control for differential access to banks in all our subsequent
estimations.

We first listed all households in the study villages and find that 52% of households in the villages we
sampled possessed below-poverty-line (BPL) cards issued by the state government, which make them
eligible for subsidized food and other social benefits (including VAS benefits in the treatment villages).
This proportion is consistent with a 2005-06 household survey that found that 47% of households in
Karnataka had BPL cards (Ram, Mohanty, & Ram, 2009). We surveyed 6,964 households with BPL cards
from the treatment and control villages and asked questions about out-of-pocket costs for medical care.
Households with a hospitalization were over-sampled and survey weights were computed to correct for
oversampling. Out-of-pocket costs are measured as the total expenditure associated with self-reported
inpatient hospital treatment that includes hospital charges, medicines, and diagnostics. Table 2 presents
summary statistics from our data. In our sample of 6,964 observations, 84% of the sample reports no
medical costs related to hospital care. Of the households that do report expenses, the mean expense is
Rs. 3,555, which is about 7.2% of their mean net worth. However, this number varies substantially,
having a standard deviation of Rs. 14,274 (about 30% of net worth), and the highest levels of expenses
account for about two-thirds of the relevant households’ net worth.

4. Empirical Model
Distribution of Out-of-Pocket Health Care Costs
Acharya et al.’s review notes that many of the studies of social health insurance lack credible
exogenous variation in insurance coverage. Further, these studies tend to focus on mean effects or the
reduction in the size of the population facing catastrophic costs, rather than focusing on the effects of
insurance across the entire distribution of out-of-pocket medical costs (Acharya et al., 2012). In line with
these previous studies, we present measures of reduction in catastrophic costs as well as changes in the
incidence of borrowing money to finance health care costs as preliminary evidence of financial risk
reduction from access to health insurance. Xu et al. (2003) defines the catastrophic health expenditure
limit as 40% of the household’s non-subsistence expenditure while Ranson (2002) defines catastrophic
expenditure as greater than 10% of annual household income (Ranson, 2002; Xu et al., 2003). We use
these definitions as the basis for our analysis of the change in catastrophic health costs but alter them to
better suit our data. We define subsistence expenditure as a household’s food expenditure and use total
consumption expenditure in place of income. In addition, we also look at alternate thresholds for both
definitions of catastrophic expenditure. We allow the catastrophic limit to vary between 40% to 80% of
non-subsistence expenditure and 10% to 50% of total consumption expenditure.

Given our interest in the distributional impacts of VAS, ordinary least square models are insufficient
to measure the change in out-of-pocket payments because they only explicitly model the conditional
mean. Koenker and Basset (1978) provide a general framework to estimate a series of conditional
quantile functions across the range of the outcome to estimate the impact of covariates at different
quantiles of the outcome variable (Koenker & Bassett Jr, 1978). This approach has been used to study
the impact of an expansion in health insurance on out-of-pocket costs (Engelhardt & Gruber, 2011;
Finkelstein & McKnight, 2008). One aspect of the out-of-pocket spending pattern that remains
unexplored in these papers is the presence of excess zeros and skewed nature of health cost data.
Beginning with Duan et al. (1983), the presence of excess zeros and over-dispersion in health cost data is
widely studied and two-part hurdle models have been a standard way to model the conditional mean
out-of-pocket payments (Duan, Manning, Morris, & Newhouse, 1983). Powell extended the framework
developed by Koenker and Basset (1978) to a censored quantile regression that accounts explicitly for a
large share of zeros, however it is computationally difficult (Powell, 1986). Chernozhukov and Hong
(2002) suggest a three step estimator for censored quantile regression under the assumption that the
underlying cost distribution is conditionally independent of the point of censoring (Chernozhukov &
Hong, 2002). The procedure uses a probability model in the first stage to select a subset of households
with a certain likelihood of incurring health costs. A quantile regression model is run on this subset,
producing an inefficient estimate of the parameters of interest. These estimates are then used to select
a second, typically larger sample of households on which quantile regression is applied again and
efficient estimates are obtained. Limwattananon et al. (2015) use this two-step process to estimate the
distributional impacts of the rollout of health insurance coverage in Thailand by comparing how the
distribution of out-of-pocket costs changed for those who were covered due to the expansion in
insurance coverage with those who always had health insurance (Limwattananon et al., 2015). We use
the same strategy to estimate the unconditional distribution of out-of-pocket payments by estimating
the quantile function of access to VAS using:
𝑄𝑂𝑂𝑃𝑖 |𝑉𝐴𝑆𝑖,𝒙𝒊 ;0 (𝜏) = 𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝛽0𝜏 + 𝛽1𝜏 𝑉𝐴𝑆𝑖 + 𝒙𝒊 𝜷𝝉 , 0); 𝜏 = 1 𝑡𝑜 99

where 𝑂𝑂𝑃𝑖 measures the out-of-pocket health costs for household 𝑖, 𝑉𝐴𝑆𝑖 is a binary indicator of

access to the health insurance scheme, 𝒙𝒊 is a set of control variables at the household level, 0 is the
point of censoring which represents zero cost in our case and 𝜏 indicates the quantile at which the

conditional quantile function is estimated. The parameter of interest here is 𝛽1𝜏 that measures the

impact of access to VAS on out-of-pocket health costs at the 𝜏th quantile. Here, identification of 𝛽1𝜏 is
9

dependent on the variation in VAS being determined by the geographic discontinuity in its expansion.
We use these estimates to construct out-of-pocket cost distributions associated with and without access
to VAS. In addition to using the model presented by Chernozhukov and Hong (2002), we model the
distribution of OOP conditional on having health costs using the standard quantile regression estimator
presented in Koenker and Basset (1978). We drop all zeros from our data and estimate the conditional
quantile function of access to VAS using:
𝑄𝑂𝑂𝑃𝑖 |𝑉𝐴𝑆𝑖,𝒙𝒊 (𝜏) = 𝛿0𝜏 + 𝛿1𝜏 𝑉𝐴𝑆𝑖 + 𝒙𝒊 𝜹𝝉 ; 𝜏 = 1 𝑡𝑜 99

Again, we are interested in gaining inference on 𝛿1𝜏 . All variables and parameters are of the same form

as the censored quantile regression. We use parameter estimates from both regression models to

predict counterfactual distributions for each household. Out-of-pocket payment distributions are then
obtained by averaging counterfactual distributions within each quantile.
Stylized Utility Model
Changes in the distribution of out-of-pocket costs imply a gain in welfare for risk-averse households;
in this section we extend the standard model to quantify such welfare gains. The standard CRRA utility
model that has been used in prior work quantifies the welfare gains from insurance as the change in the
money value that a household would pay to avoid the uncertainty of health shocks with and without
insurance coverage (Engelhardt & Gruber, 2011; Feldstein & Gruber, 1995; Finkelstein & McKnight,
2008; Shigeoka, 2014). This way of valuing welfare gains has also been used in studying the expansion of
social health insurance in developing countries such as in Thailand (Limwattananon et al., 2015) and in
Mexico (Barofsky, 2011). However, these models do not consider risk-mitigating strategies that
households resort to in order to finance medical costs (Gertler & Gruber, 2002). We incorporate
informal borrowing, asset sales and consumption floors to the stylized utility model to account for risk
mitigating strategies that are likely prevalent in developing countries.
Consider a household that earns an exogenously determined level of income (M) and wealth (W)
where wealth measures the total value of various assets the household owns. This household derives
utility from personal consumption C and household preferences are captured by a CRRA utility function:
U(C; M, W α) = u(C), where utility is concave in consumption (i.e. u’(.) > 0; u’’(.) < 0). The utility function
takes the form:

10

1
𝐶 1−𝛾
𝑢(𝐶) = �1 − 𝛾
ln(𝐶)

𝑖𝑓 𝛾 ≥ 0, 𝛾 ≠ 1
𝑖𝑓 𝛾 = 1

Where γ is the relative risk aversion parameter of the household. The household faces a risk of

poor health that requires expenditure. Similar to the rest of the literature on measuring welfare gains
from expansion in health insurance, we model only the health care expenditures as a result of health
shocks and ignore the implications of poor health on utility, health, and income. Thus, the household
faces the risk of healthcare expenditure (OOP) shocks as captured by the probability distribution
function f(OOP) and is distributed over [0, ∞].
The first departure we make from the standard model is the introduction of a consumption
floor, 𝐶̅ that identifies a subsistence level consumption beyond which the household is unable to reduce

their consumption, C, any further. We assume that healthcare costs, when experienced, are always

large enough such that the household relies on its social network and borrows or sells assets to account
for (1-x) of the total OOP and finances the remaining costs out of their income. Recent data show that,
among the rural population in India, 40% of out-of-pocket health expenditures were met by borrowing:
13% from contributions from social networks and 5% from sale of household assets (Shahrawat & Rao,
2012). Thus for our baseline estimates, we assume that 60% of out of pocket costs are financed through
informal insurance or borrowing and selling of assets. When the cost of health care is large enough that
𝑀 − 𝑥 ∗ 𝑂𝑂𝑃 < 𝐶̅ , the household finances all of the remaining health costs by borrowing more or

selling additional household assets. When a household experiences a health shock, the household’s

wealth holding (W) adjusts through two possible mechanisms; a) the debt incurred due to borrowing
from social networks and b) the additional sale of household assets. Thus, the household’s choice
problem can be written as:
max 𝑈(𝐶; 𝛼) = 𝑢(𝐶) ∋
𝐶

𝐶=�

𝑀 − 𝑥 ∗ 𝑂𝑂𝑃,
�,
𝐶

𝑊=�

�
𝐶≥𝐶
�
𝐶<𝐶

(1 − 𝑥) ∗ 𝑂𝑂𝑃,
(1 − 𝑥) ∗ 𝑂𝑂𝑃 + 𝐶̅ − (𝑀 − 𝑂𝑂𝑃),

𝑂𝑂𝑃~𝑓(𝑂𝑂𝑃)

𝐶 > 𝐶̅
𝐶 ≤ 𝐶̅

11

We can specify the household’s expected utility as:

𝐸𝑈𝑖 = � 𝑈(𝐶𝑖 )𝑓(𝑂𝑂𝑃𝑖 )𝑑𝑂𝑂𝑃𝑖

Note that this expected utility can be calculated for any out-of-pocket payment distribution of
interest. We calculate the expected utilities associated with the out-of-pocket payment distribution
when a household has access to VAS and when a household does not have access to VAS. This, in turn,
allows us to calculate the premium that the average risk-averse individual would be willing to pay to
avoid facing the uncertainty. When households do not have access to VAS the money value of avoiding
health shocks is captured by:
𝑈(𝑀 − 𝜋 𝑁𝑜𝑉𝐴𝑆 | 𝑉𝐴𝑆 = 0) = � 𝑈(𝑀 − 𝑂𝑂𝑃)𝑓(𝑂𝑂𝑃)𝑑𝑂𝑂𝑃

Where 𝜋 is the household’s willingness to pay to avoid the costs associated with a health shock.

Similarly, if the healthcare cost distribution associated with access to VAS is captured by g(OOP) then

the counterfactual money value that the household would pay to avoid health shocks is captured by:
𝑈(𝑀 − 𝜋 𝑉𝐴𝑆 | 𝑉𝐴𝑆 = 1) = � 𝑈(𝑀 − 𝑂𝑂𝑃)𝑔(𝑂𝑂𝑃)𝑑𝑂𝑂𝑃

Thus, one can measure the financial risk reduction from the change in consumption smoothing
opportunities that access to VAS allows as:

Δ𝜋 = 𝜋 𝑉𝐴𝑆 − 𝜋 𝑁𝑜𝑉𝐴𝑆

Apart from consumption smoothing, we know that levels of indebtedness and asset holding may also
change as a result of access to VAS. To account for this, we define asset protection as the difference in
the amount of out-of-pocket expenditure that had to be financed through informal insurance such as
savings, selling of assets, or help from friends and family with and without VAS. Thus, the value of asset
protection from having insurance is:

∆𝑊 = 𝑊 𝑁𝑜𝑉𝐴𝑆 − 𝑊 𝑉𝐴𝑆

Thus, we see that that total value of insurance may be attributable to a component that measures the
value of consumption smoothing and a component that measures the value from protecting the
household’s assets. Finally, note that the degree of risk aversion, γ, affects the concavity of the utility
12

function and will play an important role in valuing the differences between the out-of-pocket payment
distributions with and without health insurance. For low levels of income, a large enough health shock
would hold the household consumption level at the threshold, 𝐶̅ . Consumption is then financed

through borrowing and selling assets and the value of the insurance scheme in this situation comes from
asset protection alone. As income rises the health insurance scheme goes beyond just protecting assets.
As consumption increases above 𝐶̅ (and expenditures fall below the level of out-of-pocket expenditure

at which the household must sell assets) we expect to see that insurance provides a mix of asset

protection as well as consumption smoothing. Finally, at high levels of income the curvature of the
utility function flattens implying lower welfare gains from avoiding risk.

5. Results
Incidence of Borrowing and Catastrophic Costs
Table 3A shows that 24.2% of those who did not have access to VAS reported needing to borrow
money to finance out-of-pocket medical costs. Among those who had access to the scheme, 20.7%
reported the need to borrow money to finance out-of-pocket expenses, a statistically significant
difference. Similarly we find that conditional on any borrowing at all, households with access to VAS on
average borrowed Rs. 1,199 less than those who did not have access to the scheme.
We use multiple definitions of catastrophic health expenditure based on definitions used in Ranson
(2002) and Xu et al. (2003) (Ranson, 2002; Xu et al., 2003). Findings for each definition are reported in
Table 3B. We find weak evidence of reduction in the incidence catastrophic expenditures. We find
reductions in incidence at every value of the catastrophic limit, however few of these reductions are
statistically significant. Using Xu et al.’s (2003) definition, we find that access to VAS was associated with
a 0.71% reduction in reaching the catastrophic level of expenditure at a 10% level of significance.
Although the evidence for reduced incidence of catastrophic costs is weak, we find large reductions in
the mean amount paid over the catastrophic limit. Our estimates of the reduction in the amount paid
over the catastrophic limit range from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 37,000, nearly all of which are statistically
significant. These differences in the incidence of needing to borrow money or facing catastrophic health
costs and in the amount borrowed or paid over the catastrophic limit suggest that financial risk
protection is associated with VAS coverage.
Out-of-Pocket Cost Distribution
13

Key estimates of β1τ and δ1τ, representing the difference between the distributions with and
without access to VAS at a given quantile, are presented in Table 4. We include values of these
parameters for all 99 quantiles of our conditional quantile regression and our censored quantile
regression in the appendix. Estimates of the change in the conditional distribution using the standard
quantile regression model show a decrease in out-of-pocket expenditure associated with access to VAS
at every quantile. Our parameter estimates are generally statistically significant except for at the highest
quantiles of spending where the data is sparse. The median reduction in out-of-pocket payments
conditional on having made such payments is Rs. 2,879 while the reduction in out-of-pocket expenditure
at the 75th quantile is Rs. 4,485. In the unconditional distribution, households begin incurring out-ofpocket payments in the 79th quantile and our estimates show that at lower non-zero quantiles, VAS
eligible households paid more than ineligible households, with a maximum difference in out-of-pocket
payments of Rs. 1,257 in the 81st quantile. Spending by households ineligible for VAS overtakes spending
by VAS–eligible households in the higher quantiles. The largest statistically significant difference in
spending is Rs. 4,484 at the 94th quantile while the largest non-statistically significant difference in
spending is Rs. 19,443 at the 99th quantile. Our estimates show little difference in out-of-pocket
payments between VAS-eligible and VAS-ineligible households between the 86th and 90th quantiles. The
discrepancy in out-of-pocket expenditure patterns at lower quantiles between the conditional and
unconditional distributions is likely due to differences in utilization of hospital care. Wagstaff et al.
(2009) postulate that unchanged or increased out-of-pocket payments associated with insurance may be
due to increased health service utilization leading to additional fees being paid by households as well as
additional uncovered services being provided (Wagstaff, Lindelow, Jun, Ling, & Juncheng, 2009). Access
to VAS is associated with increased utilization of covered hospitalization but lower out-of-pocket costs
conditional on use of covered services (Sood et al. 2014), which might explain the negative estimates in
the conditional cost distribution but some positive estimates in the unconditional cost distribution.
Despite this, both the conditional and unconditional distributions show greater financial risk protection
at the highest levels of spending.
Figures 3A and 3B show these estimates graphically. Figure 3A plots the distribution of out-ofpocket payments conditional on having made any out-of-pocket payment for inpatient hospital care. We
can see that the difference in out-of-pocket costs between VAS-eligible and VAS-ineligible households is
negative for every quantile, indicating financial risk protection from access to VAS. These effects are
increasingly large at higher quantiles. Figure 3B plots the unconditional distribution of out-of-pocket
payments. We find similar patterns here as in Figure 3A, but now the first 79 quantiles are 0 for those
14

both with and without access to VAS, indicating the large quantity of households that did not experience
a health shock. For most quantiles, we see the same pattern as in the conditional distribution – lower
levels of out-of-pocket payments for the VAS eligible group with reductions increasing at larger
quantiles. However, unlike in our conditional distribution, we find slightly larger payments in the VAS
group in the first non-zero quantiles. We provide the full distributions of out-of-pocket costs in the
appendix. Conditional on having made any out-of-pocket payment for inpatient hospital care, the mean
reduction in out-of-pocket costs across quantiles associated with VAS coverage is Rs. 5,203. When
including the likelihood of not having made any out-of-pocket payment and applying Chernozhukov and
Hong’s (2002) approach, the mean reduction in out of pocket costs is Rs. 463.
Welfare Calculations
We implement the algorithm described in the methods section and calculate ∆π and ∆W for
different levels of income and risk aversion parameters, which provides an estimate of the value of the
change in the distribution of out-of-pocket payments from accessing VAS. A summary of our estimates
can be found in Table 5. As described in our stylized choice model, we assume that households use
coping mechanisms (informal insurance) to meet at least 60% of out-of-pocket health expenditures. If
the remaining 40% of expenditure still exceeds subsistence consumption, households fund the rest of
out-of-pocket costs with more borrowing and asset sales. Our analysis considered four levels of income,
four values of risk aversion, and three consumption floors. Our subsistence consumption levels are
defined as 20% of income, the poverty line, and the median food expenditure of households in our
sample (Government of India, 2013b). Setting subsistence at 20% of income is consistent with the
method used by Finkelstein and McKnight (2008) and using the median food expenditure is similar to Xu
et al. (2003) (Finkelstein & McKnight, 2008; Xu et al., 2003). The lowest income levels are set at the level
of food subsistence and the poverty line. The other two levels of income are set at the median and 75th
quantile of the India Human Development Survey estimates of income for Karnataka (Desai, 2015).
In the risk neutral case (γ=0), the value of insurance, Rs. 463, is equal to the mean difference in
out-of-pocket payments across all quantiles in the unconditional distribution. This finding is expected, as
no extra value is placed on consumption spending in the risk neutral case, and serves to check whether
our algorithm was implemented correctly. As we consider higher levels of risk aversion for the same
level of income and consumption floor, the value of insurance generally increases. This is due to the
extra value placed on consumption smoothing in more risk averse households. The exception is when
income is at or below subsistence level consumption to begin with, so that no consumption smoothing
15

occurs at any level of risk aversion. The value of asset protection remains fixed indicating the fixed
adjustment in the stock of wealth that the household makes in financing health costs. Limwattananon et
al. (2015) suggest that a risk aversion parameter of 3 is consistent with the average income of
households in Thailand (Limwattananon et al., 2015). Using this parameter, we estimate the insurance
value of the program to be between Rs. 463 and Rs. 1,075 per household. Chetty and Looney (2006)
state that poor households are likely to be highly risk adverse, taking all possible options to keep
consumption above subsistence level (Chetty & Looney, 2006). The BPL households in our sample, with
a much lower average income than the sample studied in Limwatananon et al. (2015), may exhibit much
higher risk aversion. Using higher relative risk aversion parameters of 4 and 5, we find that the total
value of insurance is between Rs. 463 and Rs. 2,689.
As income increases within a given level of risk aversion and subsistence consumption level, the
total value of the insurance rises then falls. At an income equal to or below the level of subsistence, we
find that the consumption smoothing value of insurance is zero because even in the presence of health
shocks there is no change in consumption and, thus, no consumption smoothing. For this case, the
entire value of insurance comes from the savings incurred from the reduced likelihood of asset sales
which is Rs. 463. As income levels rise above the consumption floor we see that households’ value of
insurance rises due to the consumption smoothing role of insurance. At the same time, the amount of
asset sales or borrowing needed to finance the same health shock declines and stabilizes for high levels
of incomes. As income levels rise to the 75th percentile of the income distribution we find that the
aggregate value of insurance as well as the value of the consumption smoothing role of insurance
declines. At high levels of income, health shocks are a smaller fraction of consumption expenditure and
while these households still value the consumption smoothing effect, it is not valued as much as it is at
lower levels of income.
Finkelstein and McKnight compare their estimate of the value of social health insurance for the
elderly in the United States with the social cost of the program, defined as the deadweight loss resulting
from raising the necessary government revenue plus the costs due to moral hazard effects of the
insurance (Finkelstein & McKnight, 2008). Similar approaches are used to study Japan and Thailand
(Limwattananon et al., 2015; Shigeoka, 2014). Based on data from a census of BPL households in the
study villages presented in Sood et al. (2014) we estimate that VAS covered 3.19% of all hospitalizations
in VAS eligible villages representing 0.47 hospitalizations per 100 BPL households. This reflects the fact
that VAS covered tertiary care-related hospitalizations for only seven conditions. However, these
16

tertiary care hospitalizations (such as bypass surgery) were much more expensive than hospitalizations
not covered by the program. Data from Sood et al. 2014 show that households in VAS-ineligible villages
paid on average Rs. 62,996 for hospitalizations for covered conditions in tertiary care facilities. Thus,
hospitalizations covered by VAS were roughly 15 times more expensive than the average hospitalization.
Similarly, administrative data from the year preceding our survey (2011-12) show that the average
amount paid per hospitalization by VAS was Rs. 57,517, roughly matching the hospital costs reported in
survey data. Multiplying the average amount paid by VAS with the rate of hospitalizations covered by
VAS per household results in a government cost per household of Rs. 270. Prior studies assume a
deadweight loss of roughly one third of total government expenditures, resulting in a social cost of Rs.
90 per eligible household. Sood et al. 2014 show that VAS increased utilization of covered
hospitalizations by 20 to 40%; assuming a 30% increase in utilization of covered services results due to
“moral hazard” results in an increased cost of Rs. 60. Thus the assumed deadweight plus moral hazard
cost of the program is roughly Rs. 150 per eligible household. Applying what we consider to be
reasonable parameters (risk aversion parameter of 4, consumption floor at food subsistence and income
at the poverty line) results in an insurance value of the program of Rs. 679, (Table 6) roughly 4 times the
possible deadweight cost of funding the program of Rs. 150 per household. Our lowest estimate for the
total insurance value of the program, Rs. 463, similarly exceeds the social cost of the program. We
believe that the insurance value of the program is much higher than the social cost of the program for
several reasons. First, unlike other insurance programs, which cover most inpatient and outpatient care
(such as Medicare), VAS covered only catastrophic health care expenses. This focus on rare but
expensive hospitalizations increases the insurance value of the program and reduces the social costs of
the program. Second, we believe VAS had important spillover effects on non-tertiary care that further
reduced out-of-pocket costs of VAS beneficiaries. Sood and Wagner (2015) showed that VAS increased
treatment-seeking behavior for symptoms that could lead to expensive hospitalizations if left
undiagnosed and untreated. For example, they show that persons in VAS-eligible villages were much
more likely to seek medical care for symptoms of cardiac disease such as chest pain. They also show that
VAS beneficiaries had better post-operative outcomes such as lower rates of rehospitalizations and
complications. These better post-operative outcomes could further reduce hospital costs. Finally, VAS
paid hospitals prospectively and had a strict prior authorization process. Both these features could
reduce care along the intensive and extensive margins. These spillover effects and unique features of
VAS could explain why the government cost of providing tertiary care through the program was lower
than the out of pocket cost reductions.
17

We also use back-of-the-envelope calculations to compare the financial risk protection value of
the program to the value of the program generated through improvement in health (Nyman, 1999).
Basu, Benavid, and Sood (2015) use data from VAS to estimate the disability adjusted life years (DALYs)
averted due to better access to tertiary care for cardiac disease provided to VAS beneficiaries (Basu,
Bendavid, & Sood, 2015). Basu, Benavid, and Sood (2015) find that access to VAS for cardiac care was
associated with about 2,077 DALYs averted per million in the population. Cardiac disease has a high
prevalence in India and we use DALYs averted from VAS for cardiac care as an approximation for the
DALYs averted from access to VAS for all conditions. Over the past decade, World Bank estimates of per
capita GDP in India have been about $1500. Consistent with the literature, we use three times the per
capita GDP as an estimate of the value of a DALY and calculate that access to VAS was associated with
$9.34 or Rs. 625 welfare gain per person due to improved health. This value is comparable in size to our
estimates of the value of financial risk reduction and suggests that social insurance improves welfare
through both improvements in health and improvements in financial well-being.

6. Discussion
The main policy objective of this social insurance program in Karnataka, India, was to contribute
to financial protection of poor households affected by health conditions requiring costly tertiary hospital
care. In terms of commonly used indicators for measuring financial protection, notably average out-ofpocket spending and catastrophic health care expenditure, our findings indicate that VAS achieved this
objective. Among the entire sample (not conditioning on households having any health care
expenditures), average out-of-pocket spending on inpatient care before the statewide rollout was Rs.
463 lower for BPL households eligible for VAS compared to ineligible BPL households. Among those who
had made out-of-pocket payments for inpatient care, the mean difference was Rs. 5,203. As previously
noted, the literature is mixed with regard to the financial protection effects of social health insurance in
developing countries. Our results are consistent with several studies reviewed by Acharya et al. (2012)
and studies of Medicare programs in the United States that indicated reduced out-of-pocket payments
associated with insurance (Acharya et al., 2012; Engelhardt & Gruber, 2011; Finkelstein & McKnight,
2008). At the same time, our findings contrast with other studies reviewed by Acharya et al. (2012) as
well as a recent study of Peru, which found unchanged or increased out-of-pocket spending associated
with expansion of social health insurance (Acharya et al., 2012; Bernal et al., 2014). The higher out-of18

pocket expenditures at higher levels of the distribution in Peru were explained by the possibility that
individuals who reached maximum coverage paid for more services. However, this does not seem to be
evident in the Karnataka case, where service packages were defined (by a committee including tertiary
hospital directors) with the intention that they be comprehensive in terms of required services for given
conditions and with rates reflecting input costs and market prices. These mixed results reflect the
heterogeneity of the programs evaluated and the settings in which they were implemented.
A strength of our study is its quasi-experimental design, which relies on geographic discontinuity
in health insurance coverage where households to the north of the administrative border within a state
had access to government-provided insurance and households just south of the border were not eligible
for government-provided insurance. We used a variety of data to show that eligible and ineligible
households living on either side of this administrative boundary were otherwise similar. One potential
limitation of our study is possible measurement error related to self-reported data on out-of-pocket
payments. Misreporting and lack of data also limited our analysis of the welfare gains associated with
access to insurance. Income and wealth data in developing countries can be unreliable and difficult to
obtain, requiring our welfare analysis to be run for specific levels of income. Accurate income and
wealth data would allow for more precise measurement of the welfare gains from access to VAS.
However, our results are consistent with the only similar analysis applied to a developing country,
Thailand, where the estimated financial protection value of an insurance program outweighs its
efficiency cost (Limwattananon et al., 2015).
Our analysis highlights the importance of the consumption smoothing and asset protection
effects of access to insurance, specifically in a developing country. The value of financial risk protection
from VAS was much higher than the social cost of the program and comparable to the welfare gain from
improved health. We believe that VAS provided better value for money than other insurance programs
analyzed in the literature for several reasons. First, it focused on rare but expensive and potentially life
saving hospitalizations. Second, it facilitated access to these hospitalizations by organizing health camps,
not requiring any additional paperwork for enrollment in the scheme, and operating a “cashless”
scheme where beneficiaries received comprehensive care at no out of pocket costs. Third, VAS paid
hospitals prospectively for a bundle of services and instituted a robust pre-authorization process. These
unique features of the program led to lower costs for the government and better access to life saving
treatments for beneficiaries. More research is needed to identify innovations that improve the value of
universal health insurance.
