    "abstract": "\n\nMedical experts have argued forcefully that using cigarettes harms health, prompting the adoption of myriad anti-smoking policies.  The association between smoking and mortality may, however, be driven by unobserved factors, making it difficult to discern the underlying long-term causal relationship.  In this study, we explore the effects of cigarette taxes experienced as a teenager, which are arguably exogenous, on adult smoking participation and mortality.  A one-dollar increase in teenage cigarette taxes is associated with an 8 percent reduction in adult smoking participation and a 6 percent reduction in mortality.  Mortality effects are most pronounced for heart disease and lung cancer.\n\n",
