    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper assesses the role of Friedman and Schwartz's \"A Monetary History of the United Slates: 1867 to 1960\" as a progenitor of research in monetary history. The paper critically surveys the literature on three major themes in the book: monetary disturbances; the domestic monetary framework and monetary policy: and monetary standards. The book's unique portrayal of the historical circumstances of monetary disturbances and of alternative institutional arrangements serves as the closest thing to a laboratory experiment for the monetary economist. Historical study has become an important tool of modern macroeconomic research.\n\n",
