How Integrated are World Capital Markets?
Some New Tests

ABSTRACT

This

paper presents

world capital—market

some new emprcal EV] dence on tha extent of

ntegration.

The first set of

tests carrie out

uses data from different countries to compare internationally expected

marginal rates of substitution between consumption on i+4erent dates.
If residents of different countries have access to a nominally risk-+ree
bond denominated in dollars, say, their common expected marginal rate of
substitution of future for present dollars should equal the gross
nominal return on dollar bonds. Tests of the international equality of
expected marginal substitution rates yield evidence conslster!t with a
substantial degree of international capital—market integration after,
but not before, 1973. These tests are naturally based on a carticular
model of intertemporal consumption choice, but direct estimation of the
inter—country relationships implied by that model lends support to its
assumptions. These last findings are relevant to the current debate in
macroeconomics about the role of interteinporal substitution. The second
set of tests conducted in this paper concerns correlations oetween
countries' saving and investment rates. For a sample of ten countries,
correlations between annual changes in saving and investment rates over

the period 1948—1984 look q.uite similar to those those found in quar-

terly data. Surprisingly, however,

the correlation coefficients are
often lower before the mid—1960s than afterward This finding throws
further doubt on the interpretation of saving—investment correlation
coefficients as structural parameters reflecting the reponse of domestic
investment to shifts in national saving.

The vicissitudes of the international capital market are a recur—

rino these in the work of Carlo; Din Alejandro. Simple microeconomic
theory shows how internationally integrated financial markets can is—
Drove global resource allocation by channeling the world flow of saving
toward its most productive uses. A major message of Diaz's work;
however, is that a realistic analysis of the international capital

market must contend with the influence of factors that sometimes are
difficult to model formally: moral hazards, political pressures, and
even shifts •in the prevailing paradigms of economic science. Over more

than a century and a half, all of these factors have helped produce a
series of booms and busts in international financial intermediation.
The booming world capital market of the five decades ended by World
War I provides a benchmark against which economists have often measured
the adequacy of contemporary international capital flows. In that golden
age, the market effected a continuing and substantial resource transfer
from developed to developing countries in spite of occasional reverses.1
The post—1945 world capital market appears to have been less vigorous on
the whole. Only after the early 1970s did international lending expand
to levels comparable with those of the pre—1914 period. And since the
early 1980s, the net resource transfer to developing countries has
stopped and a widespread default on foreign debts has been averted (so

financial centers also supports the view of a smoothly functioning
world capital market in the decades before 1914. See, for example,

far) only throuoh the constant involvement of official financial
agencies.

One important indicator of the contrast between the pre—1914 and
post—1945 capital markets has been the average magnitude of countries
current—account imbalances in the latter period. The current account

surplus, as the difference between a countrys overall saving anu its
domestic Investment, shows the amount of domestic savings being invested
abroad——or, in the case of a deficit, the amount of foreign savings
being borrowed to finance domestic investment. In 1965, countries classified by the World Bank as middle—income oil importers financed a mere 5
percent of their domestic Investment by drawing on foreign savings. The
figure rose to 7.6 percent in 1973 and to 15.4 percent by 1980, but
dropped sharply after 1982.2 Compare these figures with the one—third to

one—half of Argentine investment that Dlaz (1970, p. 31 reckoned was
financed by foreign capital in the years 1880—1914! For developed
countries in the postwar era, current accounts have tended to be even
smaller (as a percentage of SlIP) than for industrializing countries. The

recent United States current—account deficit, which in 1985 amounted to
nearly 18 percent of U.S. domestic investment, is an extreme outlier in
this repect.

The fact that current accounts have on the whole been so small
since 1945 is a major puzzle for economists hoping to apply open—economy
theory to open—economy policy problems. Our predictions about specific
policy measures, however, depend crucially on whether the limited net
capital flows we observe reflect an efficient global resource alloca-

tion, given countries preferences and intertemooral transformation

I. A Test of World Capital—Market Integration

Recent work in finance and macroeconomics has drawn on consumption—
based models of asset pricing developed by Breeden (1919), Lucas (1978),
and others. These models extend to a stochastic setting Irving Fisher's
i193OJ celebrated account of intertemporal consumption choice under

certainty. In the equilibria of the stochastic models, the joint dis-

tributions of asset returns and individual consumption satisfy condi—
tion that generalizes Fisher's equality between marginal rates of inter—
temporal substitution in consumption and a relative interteeporal price.

Suppose that a typical consumer maximizes

based on time—t information, P < 1 is a subjective discount factor, c,

strictly concave and differentiable. Then if Rt+i denotes the (possibly
ranøo.i real time—(t+1) payoff on any asset relative to its real purchase price on date t, individual maximization forces the consumer's
contingency plan for future consumotlon to obey the expected marlinal
equality

Under the rational expectations assumption, equations (5) and (6)
provide the testable predictions about consumption, price—level, and

exchangerate movements that underlie the statistical tests carried out
in this section and the next one.5
Before going on to assume the additional restrictions needed to
infer testable implications from (5) and (6), I want to sake two points

I am assuming that domestic and foreign agents have identical information sets. (Clearly, nominal interest rates at which bath sets of
residents can transact are common information.) The tests carried
out below do not require this assumption provided they are based on
common lagged information. Interest taxes are ignored. This omission
should have little effect on the tests if tax rates are similar
across countries.

First! if the interest rates in equations (5)

are offered by asset; issued in the same location (for example,

they are London Eurocurrency

interteuiporal consumption allocation conditions have been used in this

(I9) and Cumby (196) in attempt; to model forward premia. In my 19B6
caper. I observed that tests which do not involve assets located in
different political or regulatory jurisdictions are uninformative about
capital mobility between countries. Nonetheless, the same basic

theoretical framework can throw light on questions about international

capital mobility f they are used to compare consumption paths in dif—

The data used were quarterly series drawn from the International

can be rejected at the 10 percent significance level or below. Since u
values of 7 or greater are Implausibly high. the tests seem to indicate
that over the entire period since 1962:11, expected intertemporal marginal substitution rates for dollars and deutschemarks have no been the
same in the United States and Bermany.
The results for the U.S. and Japan show an even stronger rejection

of the null hypotheses over the sample period as a whole. Except for the
implausible cases a = 12 and 25, both H0 and H are always rejected at
the 5 percent level or below.
It is unlikely that the entire sample period studied in Tables 1

and 2 Is structurally homogeneous. In particular, the International
capital.market has expended dramatically since the early 1970s, when a
marked liberalization of industrial—country capital markets began.8 One
possible explanation of the rejections is that they reflect the influence of the earlier observations, which come from a period when
international financial markets seem to have been less Interdependent
than they are today.

To check this possibility, I split the sample at 1973.1 and conducted separate tests for the resulting subsamples. The results are
reported in Tables 3 (United States—Sermany) and 4 (United States—
Japan). The striking feature of the results in Table 3 is that for all
values of the inverse intertemporal substitution elasticity, the null
hypotheses is always rejected at lower significance levels in the first
subsample than in the second. This finding is consistent with the
hypothesis that capital—market integration has increased since the early
1970s. In most cases, however, rejection of the null hypotheses In the

subsample tests comparino the United States and Japan tell a

somewhat stronger story. Table 4 reports that for the period annng in

1972lV, both null hypotheses are rejected at extremely low significance
levels (which in most cases are essentially zero). Nonetheless, the

sqnitcance levels of the test statistics are all extremely high for the
period beginning in l973l. The results suggest that in the recent
period, U.S. and Japanese consumption have behaved as if residents of

the two countries had access to the same risk—free borrowing and lending
opportunities in both dollars and yen. This was decidedly not the case
before the early 1970s.

nother interpretation of the results comes -from the fact that the

ex post internationci differences between marginal rates of substitution
become substantially more variable after 1973. Gn this interpretation,
the higher test significance levels -found in the second subsample

reflect a drop in the tests power caused by additional noise in the
data, not an increase in world capital—market integration. In principle,

this ambiguity can be resolved in the 4uture when more data are available.

Discussion

Some important caveats apply to the interpretation of the previous

sections results
1. The consumptIon series I have used include expenditure on

14

durable goods. Host recent studies of consumption use either expenditure
on non—durables or expenditure on non—durables plus services. Both of
these measures are only partial measures of consumption: implicit (or
explicit) in the use of these measures Is the arbitrary assumption that
the excluded portion of consumption enters the utility function in a
separable manner. As Mankiw, Rotemberg, and Summers (1985) argue,
however, the separability assumption is implausible. Since some degree
of mlsspecificatlon seems likely no matter what consumption measure is
chosen, results based on the consumption measure utilized above are of
Interest. Future research should examine the sensitivity of the results
to alternative consumption proxies.
2. Available published consumption data are seasonally adjusted.

The first—order Euler condition (2) from which the tests are derived,
however, applies to seasonally unadjusted data. Miron (1985) has constructed seasonally unadjusted data for U.S. consumption and shown that
the estimation of equations like (2) may be quite sensitive to the use
of seasonal prefilters.9 The tests in this paper, however, are based on
data In the form of Inter—country differences. This may reduce the bias
due to deseasonalization, particularly if deseasonalization practices
are similar across countries.

3. The theory underlying equation (2) assumes that consumption is
uniform over the time period beginning on date t, with the consumption
decision made at the beginning of t and all variables dated t in the

consumers time—t information set. In reality, the data used are quarterly averages, so measured consumption over the quarter starting on
date t Incorporates Information that accrues between dates t and t+1.

Singleton (1986) gives a useful theoretical discussion of the effect
of prefiltering in estimating Euler-equation models.

Some countervailinq considerations sungest, however, that complete
abandonment of the model qiven by (1) and (2) may be premature. In the
study mentioned above, Miron (1985) finds that the model cannot be
rejected for U.S. data if seasonally unadjusted data are used. As I
suoqested earlier, estimates such as those in the present paper, which
are based on inter—country differences, may be less sensitive to
problems of

seasonality.

In addition, tests of Euler conditions that use

data from only a sng1e country must find appropriate data series on

rates of return. Some researchers, such as Summers (19B4), suggest that
this

is a major

difficulty.

Several studies point to liquidity constraints as a possible cause
of deviations from (2) in the aggregate. Zeldes (1985), for example,
analyzes data from the Michigan Panel Study on Income Dynamics and finds
that tfle Euler condition is rejected for families with low ratios of
linuid wealth to income, but not for the others. From that finding, and

from direct estimates of the Lagrange multipliers associated with binding borrowing limits, he concludes that liquidity constraints may lie

iii. Cross—Country Tests of the Consumption Model

test of the consumption model used in section I can be based on

equations (7) and (8. To derive readily estmab1e equations, I follow
Hansen and Hodrick (1983), Hansen and Singleton (1983) • and Hall (1985)

in assuming that per capita consumption levels, price levels, and the

exchange rate are lonormally distributed in equilibrium, that is, that
the natural loqarthms of these variables are normally distributed. No
attempt will be made to write down a general—equilibrium model that
explicitly derives a lognorinal dIstribution for these endoqenaus vari-

ables from the dstrhutions of the exogenous van ables.
Denoting by lower—case letters natural logarithms of the corresponding upper—case variables, I assume that tfle vector

The economic intuition behind (13) is

standard. in a deterministic,

continuous—time analogue of the present model, the marginal utility of
consumption in each country grows at a proportional rate equal to the
difference between the rate of domestic time preference and the domestic
real interest rate. By interest parity, the international difference
between home and foreign real interest rates is the percentage change in
the real exchange rate, q. Thus, the difference between the derivatives

(dc/dt) and *(dc*/dt) is dq/dt plus a constant reflecting any international time—preference difference. Equation (13) is the same condition
in expectation, adjusted by a constant risk premium.
Equation (13) must be expressed in terms of observables before it
can be estimated. Define the expectational errors

The results are somewhat favorable for the model, but not com-

of reasonable magnitude and quite significant. They are roughly corsis—

tent with the magnitudes found b Hansen and Singleton (1953), who also
used a logarithmic specHication but estimated Euler equations like (2)

A problem with the foregoing results arose already in section 1: we

This structural

informative once again to split the sample and perform separate subsample tests.

Estimation over the subsample 1961:1 — 1972:IV yields the estimates

when the cross—equation restriction is imposed. The significance level
of the test statistic for those restrictions is .721. The parameters are
all correctly signed, but smaller and less significant than those found
over the complete sample. These characteristics of the estimates is
unsurprising in view of the low variability of real exchange rates over
the first subsample period compared to the second. The restriction that
all the a's are equal cannot be rejected for this sample; the point
estimate for the common value of a is 0.244, and its standard error is
0. 164.

When the model is estimated over 1973:1—1985:11 the results are

the cross—equation restriction cannot be rejected. (The significance
level for the test statistic is .759.) These results are closer to the
full—sample results, except that the German preference parameter is
correctly signed. The parameter estimate is, however, insignificantly

different from zero. The 123 test statistic for the hypothesis that
all the a's are equal has a significance level of .693, so that
hypothesis appears to fit the data. The estimate of a under this
restriction is 1.240, with a standard error of 0.523. On the whole, the
results from subsample two support the model, as well as the interna—

tlonal equality

of intertemporal substitution elasticities that as

assumed in section 1.

As noted in the last section Hall (1985) has arqued that the time
aggregation problem inherent in existing consumption data.. nay bias

results such as those reported above. He sugqests laqginq instruments an
additional period, and shows that the results of Hansen and Singleton
(1983) are quite sensitive to the timinq of the instrument set. To check
whether the time—aggregation issue raised by Hall has an important
impact on the results, I now discuss estimates in which the first laq of
each instrument used is omitted. Thus, the estimates below are based on
an instrument set containing only a constant and the second and third

lags of qDM/$, Aq'! AcUS, Ac6, and Ac. The results are summarized in
Table 5.

The full—sample results are quite similar to those found using the

original set of instrumental variables. Because of probable structural
shifts, however, the subsample findings are of greater interest. For the

I961I—1972IV sample, the model appears to break down completely when
the instruments are changed. 11 coefficients are incorrectly signed,
quite insignificant, and small in absolute value. Once again however.
these results are to be expected in light of the relatively low capital—
market integration and real exchange rate variability of the period.

The results for the second subsample, 1973:I—1985:IU are similar
to those found with the original instrument set. The main differences
are that the point estimate for Germany is once again negative while tne
point estimate for Japan is substantially higher. The cross—equation
restriction easily fits the data, as does the restriction that tte three

ms are the same. The estimated common value of
estimate is significant at the 5 percent level.

Taken as a whole1 the results pDint to the persistently insignificant and frequently Incorrectly—signed 6erman preference parameter
as the model 's major empirical shortcoming. Another source of concern is

evidence of some serial correlation in the equation residuals. Even

difference for the parameter estimates, the timing problem Hall discusses may induce serial dependence in equation disturbances.

A more

detailed specification analysts is therefore needed before firm conslu—
sions can be drawn. Tentatively, however, it seems reasonable to view
the results of this section as generally supporting the model used to
construct the tests in section 1.

A potential criticism of this view comes from the empirical literature on the determinants of forward foreign—exchange premia. As Hansen
and Hodrick (1983) showed, the lognormal model implies a constant expected return to forward speculation. Their empirical tests rejected the
resulting model of the forward premium. The evidence on conditional
heteroscedasticity reported by Cumby and me (1984) also contradicts
lognormality, as do Cumby's (1986) explicit estimates of forward—
exchange risk premla, which vary significantly over time.14 It is possible that the tests of this section are less sensitive to deviations
from lognarmality than tests using forward—market data. A closely re—

13

14

Hall's criticism also applies to the tests carried out in section 1.
When those tests were re-run using regressions on lags two through
nine of the dependent variable (rather than regressions on lags one
through eight), the results were qualitatively the same. Not
surprisingly, though, significance levels tended to be higher.
Fama (1984) and Hodrick and Srivastava (1986) report additional test
results showing the variability of risk premia. Some Indirect
evidence comes from Hansen and Singleton (1983, pp. 262—264), who
are able to reject a lognormal model in the closed—economy U.S.
context.

Table 6 reports the estimated correlation coefficients between

year—to—year changes in the saving rate and the investment rate for ten
countries. The sample period runs from around 1950 to 1984 in most
cases, and because structural homogeneity is unlikely over such a long
time span, I have split the sample period at 1967. The standard errors
of these coefficients were calculated using the spectral estimator
described in Obstfeld (1986k.
Two major empirical regularities seemed to emerge from my earlier

quarterly estimates First, the estimated correlation coefficient r51
between (S/8NF) and L(iJ6NP} seemed positively related to country size,
and was statistically insignificant for some small countries and sample
periods. Second! r51 fell for all but one country between the 1960—1972
period and the period beginning in 1973, 1 noted that the first
regularity was consistent with a high degree of world capital—market

Sovernment consumption includes government investment in the U.S.

integration because of the greater ability of larger countries to Influence world interest rates. The second reqularity seemed consistent
with an increasing degree of capital mobility after 1973, a view that is
also supported by the earlier results of the present paper.

Both of these stylized facts are to some extent overturned by the
data in Table 6. For most countries, r91 actually rises between the
first and second periods in spite of the presumed increase in the international mobility of capital. Further, the association between country
size and r91 Is such less striking. Austria, for example, which had a

very low r1 value in quarterly data, has a rather high one in Table 6.
In contrast, the correlation coefficients for France (which was not in
my earlier sample) are rather low.
The new estimates underline the pitfalls of drawing inferences
about capital mobility from correlations such as those reported in the
table. The change in current account patterns between the two subsample;
probably has more to do with changing investment opportunities than with
the extent of capital—market integration. It is plausible that emerging
Investment opportunities In Europe in the 1950s and early 1960s caused a
pattern of investment increases financed by foreign (mostly American)
savings. A relative scarcity of such opportunities from 1967 on would
have tended to increase sa9lng—investment correlation coefficients, in
spite of increasing world financial integration. The reverse story
certainly seems plausible for Mexico. The development of that country's
oil resources is the probable cause of the sharp drop in Its saving—
investment correlation between the two subsample periods.
While it is difficult to place great weight on such explanations in
the absence of complete structural models of saving and investment, the
numbers do pose a challenge for those who argue that capital is essen—

tially immobile. The capital immobility hypothesis is impossible to
reconcile with many of the reported correlations, some of which do not
differ significantly from zero at the 5 percent level and most of which
are comfortably distant from the value of unity that would :haracterize
a closed economy. The correlation coefficients furnish statistical facts
about saving and investment which future structural models will have to
explain.
