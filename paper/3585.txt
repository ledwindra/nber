FROM INERTIA TO MEGAINFLATION: BRAZIL IN THE 1980s
ABSTRACT

This paper discusses the acceleration of inflation in
Brazil. In the early 1980s, the Brazilian inflation rate
increased in good measure because of the balance of payments
crisis and because of large depreciations of the cruzeiro. The
Cruzado Plan failed to stop inflation because of an extremely
loose monetary policy coupled with a lack of fiscal austerity.

Repeated price controls have increased the variability of
inflation. More recently, the decline in tax collections and the
growth of interest payments on a ballooning domestic debt have
built up a massive fiscal problem. Flight from money has further
aggravated Brazilian inflation.
Two steps are used in explaining the Brazilian inflationary
process: the analysis of price freezes in the context of
sustained fiscal imbalance and the research on the consequences
of different fiscal deficit financing forms. The paths of
inflation and real cash balances in response to different shocks
are simulated. The focus is on the effects of controls that
impose a temporary reduction of the inflation rate under
different choices for monetary and fiscal policies. A model of
an open economy where agents can hold money, domestic bonds and
inventories of goods clarifies the linkage between Brazil's
growing inability to finance the public sector deficit externally
after 1982 and the acceleration of inflation.

I. INTRODUCTION
Brazil's inflation rate reached 40 percent per month during the last quarter
of 1989. Once again policy makers discussed the possibility of imposing
price controls despite the failure of the three previous attempts in 1986,
in 1987 and in 1989 at beating inflation by freezes. Figure 1 shows
inflation rates before and after the Cruzado Plan, the Bresser Plan and the
Summer Plan.

This paper discusses the acceleration of inflation in Brazil in
the l98Os. Section II presents an overview (supported by the statistical
appendix) of the Brazilian recent macroeconomic performance. In the early
198Os, the Brazilian inflation rate increased in good measure because of the

balance of payments crisis and because of large depreciations of the
cruzeiro. The Cruzado Plan failed to stop inflation because of an extremely
loose monetary policy coupled with a lack of fiscal austerity. Repeated
price controls have increased the variability of inflation. More recently,

the decline in tax collections and the growth of interest payments on a
ballooning domestic debt have been building up a massive fiscal problem.
Flight from money has further aggravated Brazilian inflation.

Two steps are particularly useful in explaining the Brazilian
inflationary process: the analysis of price freezes in the context of

sustained fiscal imbalance and the research on the consequences of different
fiscal deficit financing forms. These two steps are taken in sections III
and IV.

Section III builds a simple model introducing financial markets

and interest rates in the traditional Cagan style model of inflationary
finance with rational expectations. It assumes inflation inertia. This means
that inflation in the cur'ent period reproduces inflation in the previous

period. Inertia occurs through the existence of formal or informal
indexation interacting with a staggered setting of wages, prices and
financial contracts. Inflation fluctuation relative to previous periods

depends on the behavior of interest rates. After characterizing steady
states, we use the model to simulate the paths of inflation and real cash
balances in response to different shocks. The focus is on the effects of
controls that impose a temporary reduction of the inflation rate under
different choices for monetary and fiscal policies.

Section IV examines the central relationship between budget
deficits, external finance and inflation. It extends the model of section
III to an open, economy where agents can hold money, domestic bonds and

inventories of goods. Our contribution clarifies the linkage between

Brazil's growing inability to finance the public sector deficit externally
after 1982 and the acceleration of inflation. The suddenly limited access to

3

external finance and the inadequacy of the government savings effort
profoundly affected the domestic macro-economic structure. Applying the
model developed in section IV to the analysis of inflation in Brazil after
1982, we discuss fiscal imbalances and balance of payments crises as causes
of inflation acceleration. We summarize our conclusions in section V.

II. OVERVIEW
Brazil has traditionally lived with high inflation rates. Between 1960 and
1964, increasingly populist administrations carried inflation from 2 to 6
percent per month. By 1968, inflation was down again to 1.5 percent, a level
that persisted until the first oil shock. Then it doubled to 3 percent per
month and doubled again to 6 percent in 1980-82. By 1983-85, inflation
increased to 10.5 percent per month. With the Cruzado Plan it fell to an
average of 5 percent per month. From then on it increased every year,
reaching more than 50 percent per month in December 1989.1

Debt stratezy and inflation

The foreign debt strategy of the 1970s and the balance of payments crisis of
the early 1980s play an important role in the history of Brazilian
inflation. After 1968, the government consciously embarked on a program of

tapping private capital markets to underwrite rapid expansion. Brazil relied
extensively on this external capital marker, implementing a debt-led model
of development to help finance the mounting capital and intermediate goods

imports associated with the average growth rates of near 10 percent between
1968 and 1973. In 1968, another component of the strategy was explicit

4

adaptation to inflation through indexation of exchange rates. This was in
addition to the indexation of wages, rents and financial assets since 1964.

When the oil shock struck in late 1973, Brazil was the largest oil
importer among developing countries. Already faced with the prospect of
weakening growth from internal cyclical causes, the government chose not to
risk a significant decline in real income from the adverse terms of trade
shock. It increased external borrowing, thus postponing the contractionary
effects of the petroleum "tax" and permitting domestic expansion to proceed.

Brazil opted for adjustment through an ambitious program of generalized
import substitution rather than export promotion or domestic recession.
An elastic supply of debt responded to Brazilian requirements.

External borrowing and brief episodes of slower domestic activity kept the
balance of payments under control until late 1970s. Higher coffee and other
commodity prices also contributed by reversing the decline in the terms of
trade. Brazilian economic performance after the first oil price shock

remained above its trend level of growth of 7 percent per year: petro-dollar
recycling transfered considerable resources to Brazil that translated them
into high rates of investment and economic growth.

On the eve of the second oil shock, Brazil had the largest
external debt in the world. Whereas the first stage of debt accumulation saw
a large transfer of real resources, in later stages more and more borrowing
went simply to cover interest obligations on earlier loans. The dynamics of
debt-led debt had become part of the Brazilian story, a process magnified by
rising interest rates.

5

The debt crisis
In 1980, facing rising oil prices and interest rates, Brazil found
additional finance available. But terms became more expensive as spreads
widened. The country was forced to a more austere set of policies and
domestic adjustment in 1981. For the first time in the post-war period
income declined. Discipline was rewarded with new capital flows.
During the generalized debt crisis in 1982, the government
insisted that the Brazilian situation was distinct and capable of simple
remedy. With a Congressional election in November, politics precluded any
appeal to the It1F until after the votes had been counted. Only then did

Brazil join the rapidly lengthening queue of problem cases. But it did so
with the disadvantage of having its own inadequate stabilization program on
the table beforehand.

Brazil managed best on its external accounts. A greater export
recovery in 1984 made it different from other large Latin American debtors.2
The current account was quickly restored to balance and the foreign exchange
constraint became less pressing. While the recession was worse than the

1930s Great Depression, the intervening decline in per capita income was
smaller than for other problem debtors. Output in 1984 was already on the
way up, led by export growth.

External adjustment

To judge from trade performance, adjustment to the debt crisis was nothing
short of phenomenal. The combination of export growth and import

substitution have produced large export surpluses in recent years. The trade

6

deficits of the 1970s turned into large surpluses after 1983. Merchandise

exports increased from 13 billion dollars per year in 1977-79 to 34 billion
dollars in 1988. At the same time, Brazil restrained imports by continuing
to expand alternative domestic supply sources. Imports in 1983-88 were lower
than in 1977-82, despite the increase in output. In 1988, real CDP was 29
percent higher than in 1979, but the volume of imports was 23 percent lower.
(Table 2.A).

In part, trade flows responded to the real depreciation of the
1980s: in the 1983-88 period, the real effective exchange rate was 20

percent lower relative to its level in 1977-82. But since the late 1960s
Brazil has also been exceptional among the Latin American countries in its
successful combination of import substitution and growth as well as

diversification of exports. Four factors have played a role: the size and
efficiency of the industrial sector, a crawling peg exchange rate policy
which has avoided long periods of overvaluation, an active promotion of
manufactured exports through incentives and subsidies, and import
restriction that has relied not merely on controls but also on the active
policy of investment directed toward import substitution in the late l970s.
The recent large trade surpluses tend to create an illusory
optimism about the ease with which large external transfers of resources can
be realized. A broader perspective, incorporating the debt as an integral
part of the Brazilian development problem, is necessary. Soaring debt
service is an important component of fiscal deterioration in Brazil and it
has been financed by growing trade surpluses. Section IV explores the
important link between trade surpluses and inflation. In Brazil, trade

7

surpluses

were used to pay interest on government debt while the government

financed the purchase of foreign exchange from the private sector by issuing
debt and printing money. As a consequence, inflation increased.

The Brazilian experience also led to the understanding that
improvement of the balance of payments and domestic equilibrium were not
tightly linked. Indeed, as discussed in section IV,

trade

surpluses might

create new problems for macroeconomic policy.

Internal Adjustment
Progress on the external account was not matched internally. The large

positive government savings of the first half of the l970s had shrunk and
turned negative in the second half of the l980s.(Table 3.A). Government

savings are not a measure of the budget surplus because they leave public
enterprises out of the picture. They do, however, show that public finance

in Brazil has been deteriorating. Two factors explain the sharp decline in
government savings. One is the growing interest payments on domestic debt.

The other is the reduction in revenues from indirect taxes. The latter
results from less than perfect fiscal indexation, from evasion and from a
growing underground economy. The Instituto Brasileiro de Ceografia e
Estatistica (IBGE) calculates that the size of the underground economy is at
least as large as 15 percent of GDP. The decline in revenue from indirect
taxes was in part counterbalanced by an increase in direct taxation in 1986.
Yet the overall trend remains one of declining tax revenues.

In 1983, successive letters of intent under IMF programs had no
sooner been dispatched than they were made obsolete by accelerating

8

inflation that crippled attempts to observe the monetary targets. That
experience led to the development of a new deficit concept, adjusted for the
indexation of government debt, now widely applied in other countries.

Budget Concepts

Table 1 shows alternative measures for the budget. When inflation
rises or abruptly falls, different budget concepts are strongly affected.
Inflation in Brazil sharply accelerated in the 1980s as did the public
sector borrowing requirements. The public sector borrowing requirements
(PSBR) move dramatically with inflation because of the inflationary

component of interest payments. If inflation were to cease, the PSBR would
shrink to the size of the budget deficit corrected for inflation.

[PLACE TABLE 1 HERE]

The operational deficit (column 2 of table 1) captures the
behavior of the budget deficit better than the Public Sector Borrowing
Requirements (PSBR). It is calculated by subtracting the monetary correction
payments from the PSBR. Nonetheless, because the monetary correction index
is not always equal to the inflation rate, the operational deficit still is
not a proper measure of the budget deficit corrected for inflation. The
difference between the two represents capital gains or losses for the public

sector. Moreover, like the PSBR, it excludes the deficit of the monetary
authorities (which distribute large credit subsidies) and thus possibly

9

underestimates in a substantial manner the actual borrowing needs of the
public sector.

One can try to overcome the shortcomings of the operational

deficit by calculating the budget deficit corrected for inflation from the
consolidated debt of the public sector. Table 1 shows this measure in its
third column, and its calculation is shown in the statistical appendix. This
measure underestimates the deficit when prices are rising. In this
definition payments and revenues are deflated by the December price index.
If inflation is high and the excess of expenditures over revenues occurs

throughout the year, deflating the deficit of each month by the December
price index grossly underestimates the budget deficit of the year. Thus,

while this measure shows the behavior of the consolidated real debt, it does
not show the deficit according to the conventional definition. i.e., it does
not measure the difference between revenues and expenditures. Moreover, this
calculation is very sensitive to real depreciations when the share of
external debt in total debt is large. Thus, in a year where there is a large
real depreciation, the ratio debt/GOP will show a large increase. After 1985
this measure underestimates the deficit because the rate of depreciation has
been smaller than that of inflation.
In 1983, as a percentage of GDP, the budget deficit corrected for
inflation was extraordinarily large. There are at least three major causes

for this large deficit. First, in contrast with historically large and
positive growth rates, output fell during 1983 by 3.4 percent. Second, the
domestic cost (corrected for inflation) of servicing the external debt
greatly increased during 1983 because of the real devaluation. Third,

10

interest on government bonds included compensation for the 30 percent

devaluation of February, because the return on these bonds had been linked
to the rate of exchange depreciation.3

In the following year the budget deficit corrected for inflation
declined. But in 1985, the budget deficit was still as large as 5 percent of
CDP. The Cruzado Plan grossly miscalculated the size of the fiscal deficit,

assuming a budget close to equilibrium, when the Cruzado Plan was launched
in in February 1986.

The Cruzado Plan
Relations with the IMF deteriorated, and previous plans for a mulciyear
rescheduling agreement with the banks were scrapped after a new civilian
government took office in March 1985. Although interest on the external debt
was fully paid, there were no inflows of new capital. Recovery was then
based on internal demand, with limited import increase. Despite strong

output growth, worrying signs came from increasing government internal debt
service, low investment rates and accelerating inflation. New and bold
measures were called for.

The Cruzado Plan, implemented in February 1986 as a substitute for
a conventional recession-based strategy of stabilization, was centered upon
the premise that the high rates of inflation were driven by the inertial,
self-replicating force of indexation.4 Accordingly, the Cruzado Plan
enforced a sophisticated short-term standstill that maintained real income
positions and abolished future indexation. The key steps of the Cruzado Plan
were the following:

11

• Wages, rents and installment payments were readjusted and frozen, as were
all prices and the exchange rate.
• A tablita was devised to compensate for the expected inflation built into
extant contracts and thus avoid arbitrary redistribution between debtors and
creditors. A new currency was introduced to help facilitate the
readj us tulent.

• Indexation was virtually eliminated. An escala novel, with a 20 percent
threshold, was substituted for wages. In financial markets, indexation was
maintained only for instruments of more than one year maturity.
Inflation was to be zero. For a few months it seemed true, and
there was generalized euphoria. But signs of disequilibrium from excess

demand mounted without inducing adequate compensatory response. Another
election loomed, and in the best Brazilian political tradition, corrective
actions were placed on hold.

This time the new measures were announced immediately after the
election. They proved much too late, and much too little. The ice of
controls had thawed, and there was no opportunity to restore an orderly

process of readjustment of prices and wages. Events rapidly moved Out of
control as inflation rates mounted. There seemed to be policy impotence. The
deterioration in the balance of payments became as significant as the
mounting internal problem. Suddenly, Brazil's comfortable cushion of
reserves, that could lend credibility to the maintenance of a fixed exchange
rate, had vanished.

There is no controversy about the reasons why the Cruzado Plan
failed. The most prominent factor was the overheating of the economy through

12

loose fiscal and monetary policies, as well as through the overly generous
wage policy. On the fiscal side, tax revenues disappointingly rose only a
little, revenues of state-owned companies were hurt by the price freeze,
spending ran higher than anticipated, and subsidies that were cut during
1983-84 staged a comeback in 1986. The public sector wage bill also
increased in line with the economy-wide trend. There was a sharp initial
monetisation of the economy: in the first three months following

stabilization the monetary base doubled. Loose monetary policy produced very
low interest rates that permitted firms lacking confidence in the program to
build up speculative stocks. Furthermore, the increase in real wages

promoted by the Cruzado Plan and the fast-growing economy rapidly expanded
wages and sustained a consumers' boom.
New attempts at controlling inflation were made in mid-1987, with
the Bresser Plan, and in January 1989 with the Summer Plan. Once again the
government froze prices and cut zeros off the face value of the currency.
Promises to eliminate the budget deficit were made but not kept. President

Jose Sarney lacked the political will to implement measures of fiscal
consolidation. He also lacked credibility, determination and allies in the

Congress. With the budget deficit left unscathed and the trade surpluses
growing, all the three plans amounted to attempts to stop inflation by
decree.

Institutional Adaptation

Policy makers, designing the Cruzado Plan, believed that past inflationary
shocks were being perpetuated in a vicious circle created by indexation.

13

Freezing prices, exchange rates, and wages would create a rupture with the
past, thus permitting the economy to rid itself of inertial inflation.
The main obstacle to the price and wage freeze was the absence of
synchronization in price readjustrnents. Simply freezing wages and prices on

a given day would greatly favor wage earners and entrepreneurs who had
readjusted their prices immediately before the freeze. In a likely manner,
such a step would drastically punish those who were to have received their
new settlements the following day.

Incomes policy, rather than playing the role of a coordinating
device, became the major objective of the Cruzado plan. All attention was
concentrated in deriving formulas that would permit a "neutral" price
freeze. Nonetheless, the objective of "neutrality" in income distribution
remains elusive because the choice of a reference point remains arbitrary.

The initial price freeze will not produce excessive windfall
profits or losses only if there is little dispersion of relative prices. The
dispersion of relative prices in the context of a staggered price setting
introduces a serious problem for the use of freezes in the coordination of

expectations during a stabilization program. It is sometimes asserted that
dispersion of relative prices will be less when inflation is higher because

adjustments take place at shorter intervals. The Brazilian experience does
not support this view. When inflation rises, adjustments take place at
shorter intervals but are also bigger. Rising inflation does not contribute
to reducing the dispersion of relative prices, but can make the problem
worse. In Brazil, during the last week of December 1989, a Chevette cost the
same as 42 standard-size brassieres and a refrigerator the same as a linen

14

shirt. The same bottle of wine cost 50 cruzados in one supermarket and 15
cruzados in another.

Institutional adaptation to rising inflation has become pervasive

as buyers and sellers, borrowers and lenders, the government and the tax
payers have engaged in a self-defeating race to shorten the lags on pricing
and indexation. Since 1988, the supermarkets in Rio have closed each Monday
morning to remark prices and by the end of 1989 firms were discussing weekly
adjustments for wage earners. By November 1989, the sales of electronic

calculators and the number of credit cards had doubled in relation to their
numbers in 1988. To avoid delayed reimbursement, many merchants were
offering shoppers 30 percent discount for instant payment in cash or checks.

By the end of 1989, most restaurants and hotels stopped accepting credit
cards because 20-day billing period eroded the value of payments. Contracts

no longer were made in cruzados, but in terms

of

BTNs (a national treasury

bond, daily corrected for inflation and used as unit of account).

[PLACE FIGURE 2 HERE]

Figure 2 shows the daily inflation rate between April 4th, 1988
and August 31st, 1989. One observes that on average, inflation picked up at
regular weekly intervals. At the beginning of 1989, there was an
extraordinary jump of the daily index as merchants increased prices in
response to an expected price freeze that did materialize with the Summer
Plan. Soon controls were lifted and once again inflation was on the rise.

III. INFLATIONARY FINANCE

This section builds up a model of inflationary finance and explores the role
of price controls on inflation behavior.

Consider an economy where government expenditures, C, are financed
by money creation, Ht -

C —

(1)

Ht

Rtl

Dividing both sides of equation (1) by nominal income, assuming
zero real growth and using the definition of the inflation rate, we obtain:5

h —

(2)

g + htl (1/(1t)

where: g is the share of the real budget deficit in real income and h is the
ratio between real cash balances and real income.
Our next question concerns the dynamics of inflation. The
inflation rate accelerates whenever aggregate demand exceeds the full
employment output level. For a given fiscal stance and real exchange rate,
there is a unique real interest rate at which aggregate demand equals full

employment output. Accordingly, equation (3) shows that inflation increases

it,

whenever the actual real interest rate, i -

is below the full employment

real interest rate, p:

(3)

-

—

[p(g)

-

(i(ht)

-

16

where p is a function of the share of government expenditures in GD?. We
also assume that the nominal interest rate moves in order to clear the money
market all the time. The demand for real cash balances is inversely related
to the nominal interest rate. Thus, we can write the actual interest rate,
as a function of real cash balances in the equation above, Note that
equation (3) implies the existence of both inflation inertia and a scope for
monetary policy to affect inflation.
Figure 3 illustrates steady state equilibria. In steady state, the
inflation rate is constant. We represent the steady state inflation rate in
figure 3 as the schedule6 showing itt

—

p—i(h) -it

(4)

[PLACE FIGURE 3 HERE

In steady state, the ratio of real cash balances and real income
is also constant:

h it

(5)

—g

(1-4-it)

We represent the steady-state budget constraint in figure 3 by the
schedule showing ht —

There are two equilibria: El and E2. The low inflation
equilibrium, El, can be stable. The nature of the time path around the low
inflation equilibrium is one of oscillations as in the cobweb model. The

17

high inflation equilibrium, E2, is unstable.7 This model exhibits the
essential property that, in the transition to a sustained increase in money
growth, the inflation rate, on average, exceeds the growth rate of money.

Price Controls
In the context of a budget deficit financed by money printing, price
controls would reduce inflation temporarily. Continuous money growth in the
presence of price controls increases real cash balances reducing interest

rates. As a consequence, once price controls are removed, inflation picks up
again. Through oscillations, inflation would then return to its initial
level, if the initial equilibrium was stable.
We can simulate the path of inflation by assuming specific
functional forms for money demand and values for the parameters in equations

(l)-(3). We make: i —

j - vh,

with j —

0.62 and v — 4. We also assume that

— 0.05, p — 1 percent per month and g — 1.5 percent. Thus, in the initial
stable steady state: ir — 15 percent per month and h —

0.115.

Figure 4 compares two situations. In the first one, the government
freezes prices during one period. In the second, it uses guideposts rather
than a price freeze. Once controls are removed, the price freeze leads to a
bigger overshooting of the inflation rate than in the case of loose
controls. Under both circumstances, the inflation rate finally returns to
the 15 percent steady state level. In this model, price controls can only
lead to an explosive inflation race under two circumstances. The first
situation corresponds to one with an unstable initial equilibrium. The

18

second situation corresponds to one where the inflation rate, in response to
the price freeze, moves out of the stability region.

[PLACE FIGURE 6 HERE

Cuttinz the Budget Deficit
Figure 5 compares equilibria for different fiscal deficits. A cut
in government expenditures shifts the steady state budget constraint
downwards. It also reduces the full employment real interest rate,

thus

shifting the schedule irtirt1 to the right.

[PLACE FIGURE 5 HERE I

Assume that, consistent with a 0 real interest rate per month,

the

reduced budget deficit share in output, g, is 1 percent. In the new stable
steady state the inflation rate will be 8 percent per month and the real
cash balances share in income will be 0.135.

How does the economy move from the initial 15 percent inflation to
the new 8 percent final equilibiriurn? If policy-makers could precisely

determine both the new steady state inflation rate and the size of the
desired real cash balances consistent with it, they could cut the deficit
and at the same time increase money by the right amount and choose adequate
price controls. Under these very special circumstances,

they could

immediately bring the economy to the new steady state.8 Unfortunately,

perfect information and synchronization do not exist. Thus, we must compare

19

less perfect but more realistic policies. We compare the inflation path that
follows the

adoption

of:

• a budget deficit cut with and without price controls;
• a budget deficit cut with and without a change in the money stock.

Price Controls in the Presence of a Fiscal Contraction
Figure 6 compares the inflation path in response to a cut in the budget
deficit in three different situations:
• no controls
• loose controls during five periods
• a price freeze during five periods.

[PLACE FIGURE 6 HERE]

Figure 6
inflation

reduces

shows that loose controls produces a deceleration of

sooner than would

have taken place in its absence and it also

the size of the cycles around the new steady state. By contrast, in

the case where the inflation rate is not zero in the new steady state, the
price freeze exaggerates the size of the cycles.

This exercise helps to understand the success of loose controls in
the 1965-68 stabilization in Brazil.

Combtnin2 Fiscal and Monetary Austerity

Figure 7 shows that a cut in the budget combined with a monetary squeeze is
overkill. The inflation rate declines faster, but the recession and the
following cycles are made more acute.

20

[PLACE FIGURE 3 HERE]

Monetizing Public Debt
Fiscal and monetary austerity were not part of the economic package adopted
in Brazil with the Cruzado Plan. On the contrary, fiscal policy was left
untouched in the immediate aftermath of the Cruzado Plan and monetary policy
was expansionary.

Figure 8 shows the path of real cash balances in response to an
increase in the money stock with and without price controls. This figure can
be compared with the figure showing the actual behavior of real Ml in Brazil
(figure 9). The acceleration of inflation in Brazil, once price controls

were removed after the Cruzado Plan, does not need a very elaborate
explanation.

[PLACE FIGURE 8 AND FIGURE 9 HERE]

IV. THE CAUSES OF INFLATION

Section III clarified two processes. First, the model in section III showed
how price controls, in the presence of a sustained budget deficit,

ultimately increases inflation instability. Second, we argued that a
monetary expansion combined with a price freeze clearly was one of the
factors of inflation acceleration after the Cruzado Plan. Questions
concerning the link between domestic and external debts with inflation have
to be answered in the context of a model more complex than the one described

21

in section III. We now develop a model to study the inflationary impact of
financing the budget deficit in different ways and of depreciating the
exchange rate

Montiel (1989) divides recent analyses of inflation into a
"fiscal' view and a "balance of payments" view. Followers of the 'fiscal"
persuasion point to movements in the budget deficit as the fundamental

source of monetary emission that moves the economy to higher inflation
rates. Supporters of the "balance of payments" theory link inflation to
exchange rate depreciation triggered by balance of payments crises.

Computing historical decompositions of the Brazilian inflation rate based on
vector autoregressions, Montiel concluded that movements in base money and
the nominal exchange rate have played an important role in determining the
time path of the rate of inflation in Brazil between 1983:1 and 1985:4.
Brazilian inflation for most of that period resulted in good part from
inertia and increased because of new shocks deriving from exchange rate
depreciation. Monetary shocks had an important role only in the last two
quarters of 1985.

Rodriguez (1978) offered a starting point for the discussion of

the devaluationinflation spiral in a model where the government finances
the budget deficit through central bank credit creation.9 He showed that
under these circumstances, while casual observation would indicate that
inflation is preceded by devaluation and monetization of the resulting
balance of payments surpluses, the conclusion that the external sector is
the cause of inflation would be inappropriate:

Although it is correct that over a short period following the
devaluation external sector developments lead the movement in domestic

22

prices, over the entire typical cycle the price level follows the path of
the money supply, which is determined entirely by domestic credit
creation to finance the fiscal deficit.(. . .) Both the price level and the
exchange rate (are) led by developments in the monetary sector, which are
in turn determined by the monetization of the.internal fiscal deficit.'
The situation described by Rodriguez can be complicated if
external credit rationing follows a period of external borrowing by the
government. Consider, for example, a situation where a government has a
large external debt. Suddenly, deprived of foreign capital inflows needed to

finance interest payments and non-interest deficits, it will have to foster
trade surpluses to produce the needed exchange resources to service the
external debt. In order to produce these trade surpluses, the exchange rate
is greatly depreciated in real terms. The government now has to finance
domestically the purchase of foreign exchange it needs to service the

external debt. In the absence of a cut in the budget, there will be more
government credit creation. Moreover, depreciation has an important impact
on the domestic cost of servicing the external debt. Debt service measured
in domestic currency increases and thus the budget deficit measured in that
currency also increases. This, in turn, increases money creation and hence,
inflation.

Observe that the inflationary impact of the trade surpluses does
not necessarily come from an increase in foreign reserves, as in Rodriguez
(1978). If the trade surplus is used to pay interest on government debt and
is not counterbalanced by an increase in taxes, it will increase money
creation, even if reserves remain unchanged.

Under these circumstances, what "caused" inflation to rise? The
disappearance of the external source of finance? The exchange rate

23

depreciation? The deterioration of the budget that resulted from the
depreciation? The monetization of budget deficits that were previously
financed by external borrowing and counterbalanced by trade deficits?
The answer, of course, is all of the factors mentioned above. In
the absence of a budget deficit neither external credit rationing nor
exchange depreciation would cause a persistently higher inflation rate. On
the other hand, without credit rationning and depreciation, the inflation
rate would not increase.

We now explore this situation formally. Our first question

concerns the fiscal budget and its financing. The government finances the
budget deficit by borrowing abroad, by issuing domestic debt and by creating
money. We assume that the current account is financed either by commercial
loans or by changes in foreign reserves. All external borrowing is done by
the public sector. The appendix shows how we can combine the equations for
the budget constraint and the balance of payments to obtain:10

g++ib—h+b

(6)

where: g — share in output of the primary budget deficit
—

share in output of net exports

i —

nominal interest rate

b —

h —

ratio between

between domestic debt and income

the monetary base and income

growth rate of the monetary base

w — growth rate of domestic debt.

24

Net exports are equal to the interest payments on the public
external debt in the special case where, after a decade of external
borrowing by the government, there is external credit rationing and no
change in foreign reserves.11

Domestic agents hold money, domestic bonds and inventories of
goods. Demand for real cash balances is inversely related to the interest
rate, i, and inversely related to the inflation rate, it:

The demand for domestic bonds depends positively on the interest
rate and inversely on the inflation rate:

b—0+fl1i -

The government follows a "passive' monetary rule, letting money
growth match the inflation rate when inflation is stable, but reducing the
money growth rate when the inflation rate increases:

The growth rate of domestic debt is endogenous. Substituting (7)(9) in (6) we

obtain the equation that describes the behavior of the real

domestic debt through time:

Our next step is to re-interpret equation (3) from section II that
describes the dynamics of inflation. As before, the equilibrium nominal
interest rate is part of the real interest rate which influences inflation
dynamics. In the goods market, inflation increases whenever the actual real
interest rate,i -

it, is

below the full employment real interest rate, p,

which is now a function of both the share of government expenditures and of
net exports in income:

[PLACE FIGURE 10 HERE]

There are two steady state equi1ibria. The high inflation
equilibrium, point B in figure 10, is unstable. At the high inflation
equilibrium, any disturbance will move inflation onto an explosive path. The
low inflation equilibrium in figure 10, point A, can be stable. The nature

of the time path around the low inflation equilibrium is one of oscillations
as in the cobweb model.

Comparative Dynamics: External Credit Rationing Changes the Source of
Finance of the Budget Deficit
If external finance dries up and the government responds by depreciating the
exchange rate, there is an increase in the trade surplus, .

The increase in

the trade surplus shifts the schedule representing the steady state budget
constraint downwards as shown in figure 11. On the other hand, the increased
trade surplus requires a higher full employment real interest rate, i.e., a
higher domestic debt/income ratio. Thus, the schedule that represents steady
state inflation shifts upwards.

(PLACE FIGURE 11 HERE]

27

The economy moves from the initial equilibrium, A, to a new one,

A', where the domestic debt and the inflation rate are higher than before.
With the increase in the trade surplus, the economy moves, with
oscillations, to the higher inflation equilibrium. Initially, the inflation
rate increases ahead of the nominal interest rate and the real, interest rate

falls, stimulating activity and pushing up the inflation rate. Gradually,
the interest rates exceed inflation rates, increasing the real interest rate
and. the domestic debt.

An increase in the budget deficit generates exactly the same
results as those described above. A reduction of the external finance of the
budget, requiring a devaluation and an increase in the trade surplus, is
thus equivalent to an increase in the budget deficit.

Because there is a limit to the budget deficit that can be
financed by seigniorage, or to the trade surplus that can be monetized,
further increases in the budget deficit or in the trade surplus might rule
out any crossings of the two schedules, denying the existence of an
equilibrium solution to the model.

We also observe that in response to an increase in the budget
deficit, or in response to a reduction in the external finance of the budget
deficit, both the inflation rate and the ratio of domestic debt to income

increase. The debt crisis in Brazil manifests itself not only in rising
inflation but also in the rapid growth of domestic debt. (Table 7.A). The
rapid domestic debt growth results in part from the financing of both the

primary deficit and of debt service. In 1989, problems were made more acute
by the high real interest rates, shown in figure 12.

28

[PLACE FIGURE 12 HERE)

During the last two quarters of 1989, the goal was to maintain a
restrictive monetary policy and, in practice, this was translated into very
high real interest rates. Nonetheless, the public could effectively write
checks on their overnight deposits which were backed by the government debt.
That implied that open market operations traded non-paying-interest- money
for money paying interest and thus they did not affect liquidity. The high
interest rate avoided the flight into dollars and real assets and the

government continued to enjoy financing for the deficit. But without debt
relief, fighting current inflation with tight monetary policy must
eventually lead to higher future inflation or debt repudiation of some kind.

In the case of Brazil the situation is made more serious because of the
extremely short maturity of the debt.

V. CONCLUSIONS

Several factors explain inflation in Brazil. Between 1979 and 1983 its
acceleration resulted from supply shocks and large real depreciations in the

context of an indexed economyJ5 Because of a large external debt, the
fiscal imbalance also increased in this period with real depreciations and
the increase in foreign real interest rates. After 1984, when the government
could not finance the deficits externally anymore, monetization of deficits
and acceleration of money growth became important inflationary factors.
Despite the decline of inflation-corrected budget deficits, the

29

disappearance of external sources of finance made the fiscal deficits more

inflationary because they had to be financed domesticallyJ6 Moreover, the
perception of unsustainable fiscal imbalances led to financial adaptation
and flight from money, further aggravating the inflation problem.17
Table 2 summarizes the stylized facts that our model has tried to
replicate. In the two years that followed the Cruzado Plan, the average
monthly inflation rate was about the same as it had been in the two years
that preceded the Cruzado Plan. Instability nonetheless increased, as
measured by the coefficient of variation of inflation, by the premium in the
black market for dollars and by the coefficient of variation of the index of
the Sao Paulo stock market.

The very fast acceleration of inflation after 1988, as well as the
recent sharp increase in real interest rates, cannot be directly attributed
to the failure of the Cruzado Plan alone. The culprits are several attempts
to control inflation through price freezes and, more recently, by tight

monetary policy alone, all the while avoiding the necessary fiscal
adjustment.

There are four important lessons to be learned from the Brazilian
experience.

• The first lesson derives from the inadequacy of the public
sector savings effort. What occurred in the 1980s can be characterized as an
"accoinodation" to the disappearance of external sources of finance rather

than a structural adjustment. External debt reduction through different
types of swaps coupled with large budget deficits,

financed by expensive

domestic debt have evolved into a massive fiscal problem.

30

Inflation stabilization now requires a major fiscal effort. In the
Brazilian case it requires action on three fronts. Foremost the position of
the public sector in Brazil continues to be badly compromised by the need to
extract resources from the private sector for the service of the external
debt. To obtain fiscal consolidation without a major recession, Brazil need
to reduce the transfer of resources abroad. Today that means debt reduction
and postponement of debt service.
Domestic debt has also grown to finance the budget deficit as well
as to pay for large subsidies granted to public enterprises and the private
sector itself. The maturity of this debt is explosively short. Budget
equilibrium requires the consolidation of the domestic debt. This could be
achieved by privatization with the proceeds used to retire debt and by a
forced lengthening of the maturity of the remaining instruments.
Moreover, solving the two debt problems will not be enough to
restore stability. Fiscal consolidation requires major cuts in subsidies and
better tax adsiinistration.

• The second lesson concerns the use of price controls. In the
absence of fiscal consolidation, price controls increase inflation
instability. They stimulate demonetization and increase the financial
vulnerability of the economy. These effects are not easily reversed after
stabilization.

Here one should also notice the difficulty of managing neutral
disinflation. In 1986 real wages were increasing at the expense of profit
margins, helping to provoke shortages, black markets and disorderly growth.

31

• Third, even if fiscal and monetary policies are just right

for stabilization, the problem of the transition from a situation with
high inflation to one with a low inflation rate still has to be dealt

with. In that case, price guideposts will help to smooth transitton.
• Finally, it

is

too easily

asserted

that getting rid of

indexation is essential to achieve inflation stabilization. This is
wrong, as demonstrated by the excessive boldness of the Cruzado Plan in

aiming for zero inflation and abolishing indexation. While indexatlon
contributes to the propagation of inflation, it also protects against the
kind of volatile inflationary acceleration that occurred at the end of

1986 and beginning of 1987. Indexation establishes inertia at a lower
inflation rate, locking in disinflation gains. A good example are the
years of low and stable inflation rates in Brazil between 1968—74.
Indexation also facilitates political acceptance of a stabilization
program, an attribute that cannot be overestimated.

Surprisingly, the deficit corrected for inflation in 1983 is practically
the same as the PSBR. Here the reason might well be large subsidies given

through the monetary authorities and excluded from PSBR but not from the
deficit corrected for inflation.

For detailed analyses of the Cruzado Plan see, for instance, Arida and
Resende (1985), Barbosa and Simonsen (1989), Cardoso and Dornbusch (1987),
Cardoso and Fishlow (1990), Modiano (1988) and Simonsen (1988).

We divide (1) by PY to obtain: (C/PY)_(Ht/PtY)(Ht..l/Pt.lY)(Pt1/Pt),
where we substitute: lrt —

- 1.

We assume that government can

choose g. And, of course, H is endogenous.
6 The slope of the schedule representing steady state inflation is given by
dir/dh —

Si/&h < 0.

In drawing figure 2 we assumed a linear relationship

between i and h, i.e., we assumed: i —

j

-

vh,

with j—.62 and v—4.

For stability, it is necessary that the schedule ht —
schedule

—

t-1 from below, i.e.: -(Si/&h) >

h..i

cuts the

ir/(h-g).

8This policy mix entails a credibility problem. Increasing money by the

rig1t amount may be interpreted by the public as a phase of expansionary
monetary policy despite the cut in the budget deficit.

9see also Dornbusch (1987) and Ize and Ortiz (1987).

39

10 For simplicity, we use continuous time.
We assume that policy makers set expenditures and taxes, and thus choose
g. We also assume that they set the nominal exchange rate and its
devaluation rate. Given that there is inflation inertia, they actually set

the rate of real devalution, and thus can choose .

14 The necessary condition for stability, as shown by the arrows in
figure 10 is that the schedule representing the steady state budget
constraint cuts the schedule representing the steady state inflation rate
from below.

15 Table 2.A in the Statistical Appendix shows a sharp real depreciation at
the end of the 1970s and another one in 1983.

16 Between 1982 and 1988, the ratio of the consolidated debt of the public
sector/GDP more than doubled. The ratio of the external debt/GDP

increased

sharply in mid-1980s and declined in recent years. See Table A.3 in the
Statistical Appendix.

17 Velocity shows a growing demonetization of the economy between 1970 and
1985, a remonetization in 1986, and a fast demonetization since 1987.
