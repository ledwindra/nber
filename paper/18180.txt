Behavioral Economics and the Demand for Alcohol: Results from the NLSY97

NBER Working Paper No. 18180

JEL No. D03,I18
ABSTRACT
The behavioral economic model presented in this paper argues that the effect of advertising and price
differ by past consumption levels. The model predicts that advertising is more effective in reducing
consumption at high past consumption levels but less effective at low past consumption levels. Conversely,
the model predicts that higher prices are effective in reducing consumption at low past consumption
levels but less effective at high past consumption levels. Unlike the models used in most prior studies,
this model predicts that the effects of policy on average consumption and on the upper end of the distribution
are different.
Both FMM and Quantile models were estimated. The results from these regressions show that heavy
drinkers are more responsive to advertising and less responsive to price than are moderate drinkers.
The empirical evidence also supports the assumption that education is a proxy for self-regulation. The
key conclusions are that restrictions on advertising are targeted at heavy drinkers and are an underutilized
alcohol control policy. Higher excise taxes on alcohol reduce consumption by moderate drinkers and
are of less importance in reducing heavy consumption.

1. Introduction
This paper presents a new empirical study of the effects of alcohol cues and price on
alcohol consumption. The specific alcohol cues which are examined are those provided by
alcohol advertising on TV and alcohol references included in TV programming. A novel feature
of this study is that the empirical work is guided by a blend of behavioral economic and
neoclassical economic theory. The resulting theoretical model benefits from the insights of
behavioral economics while maintaining the empirical tractability of a conventional neoclassical
demand model. Behavioral economic theory argues for a dual agent approach to examine the
effects of advertising and price and neuroeconomic laboratory research provides evidence of a
biological basis for this approach. The theoretical model employs the analytically convenient
fiction of two separate underlying decision mechanisms but emphasizes a single decision
outcome. The key conclusions of the theory is that heavy drinkers are more responsive to cues
such as alcohol advertising and alcohol references in programming on TV and less responsive
to price than are moderate drinkers. If this is the case, then restrictions on cues are targeted at
heavy drinkers and are an important alcohol control policy. The theory also implies that, while
price may limit the consumption of moderate drinkers, price is of limited importance in reducing
heavy consumption. These assertions are tested with a large scale secondary data set.

In the U.S., alcohol advertising on TV is substantial. The advertising- to-sales ratio for
alcohol is about 5 percent, while the typical industry advertising-to-sales ratio is about 2 to 3
percent. Data from Kantar Media show that alcohol advertising just on TV was about $1.1
billion in 2009. There has not been much change in the overall level of expenditures on alcohol
advertising on TV between 2002 and 2009. However, annual hours of alcohol advertising on
national TV increased by about 50 percent and local TV hours declined by about 20 percent.
Spirits advertising on TV has been a major growth area. According to Ad Age, 2011, for all
media, spirits and blended liquors had an advertising-to-sales ratio of 14. This large ratio comes
1

mainly from the use of TV. Under the terms which ended prohibition, spirits producers
voluntarily agreed to not use broadcast media for advertising. In 1996, the spirits industry
abandoned this voluntary agreement and placed ads on cable TV stations. At that time, the four
largest broadcasters ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC refused to run ads for spirits. However,
gradually, local stations affiliated with NBC and CBS have been accepting spirits ads placed
after 10 pm. Elliot (2009) reported that one alcohol ad shown in 15 major markets on CBS
affiliates reached 31 percent of all American households.

Alcohol cues on TV also come from alcohol use and references in TV programming and
are ubiquitous. Christensen, Henriksen and Roberts (2000) found that on prime-time TV, 71%
of all programming depicted alcohol use and 77% contained references to alcohol. Russell and
Russell (2009) studied a sample of 144 unique episodes from eighteen shows based on
Nielsen's top-rated prime-time television series on NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox, and WB including five
situation comedies, one cartoon, and twelve dramas. They found that all the shows contained
visual alcohol portrayals and verbal alcohol references.

Alcohol prices vary across the country although there has been little change in prices
over time. Federal alcohol excise taxes have not changed since 1991. At the state level there
have been a number of small changes since 2002 amounting to only a few cents per gallon.
Data from the BLS shows that alcohol prices for at home consumption increased by about 33%
from 1999 to 2011. Since the overall CPI increased by about 30% during this time period there
has been little change in the real price of alcohol for at home consumption.

2. Prior Studies
There are a growing number of studies in the economics literature and in the public
health literature on the effects of alcohol cues on alcohol consumption. However, few studies
2

provide any information on potentially differential effects by consumption level. A review of
economics studies by Gallet (2007) examined 132 studies of alcohol demand which included an
advertising measure. Gallet reports a mean value for the advertising elasticity of 0.03. He
compares this to a value for the price elasticity of -0.535 and concludes that advertising has only
a limited impact on alcohol consumption. However, the studies in the review do not distinguish
the effects of advertising on heavy drinkers from the effects of advertising on moderate drinkers.
Since most drinkers are in the moderate category, the failure to distinguish individuals by
consumption level may mask the effect of advertising on heavy drinkers.

The public health literature provides a stronger consensus for a positive effect of alcohol
cues than the economics literature. Again, few of these public health studies look for
differences in the effect of advertising by consumption level. However, an experimental study
by Koordeman et al. (2011) found that alcohol commercials prior to a movie led to increased
consumption of alcohol, but only in heavy drinkers. Consistent with these results, McCusker
(2001) found that memories of positive drinking outcomes are more accessible for heavy
compared to moderate drinkers and Tapert et al. (2003) found that alcohol advertising leads to
distinct patterns of brain activation, causing craving responses and affecting consumption
decisions in heavy drinkers. Engels et al. (2009) tested experimentally whether portrayal of
alcohol images in movies and commercials on television promotes actual drinking. They had
young adult males watch a movie clip with two commercial breaks. The subjects were allowed
to drink non-alcohol and alcoholic beverages. These participants were randomly assigned to
one of four groups defined by increasing levels of exposure to alcohol portrayals. The
participants assigned to the conditions with most alcohol portrayals in either movies or
commercials consumed on average 1.5 glasses more than those in the condition with no alcohol
portrayals.

3

There are a number of studies in the economics literature on the effect of alcohol price
on alcohol consumption. In contrast to studies on alcohol advertising, several studies of alcohol
price look for differential effects by drinking level. Prior studies which examined heavy drinking
find lower elasticities than those estimated for per capita drinking. A review by Wagenaar et al.
(2009) reports a mean alcohol price elasticity of -0.51 for all drinking and a mean price elasticity
of −0.28 for heavy drinking. Another review by Wagenaar, Tobler and Kromo (2010) of 50
studies examined the effects of alcohol price on various negative outcomes related to alcohol.
They report price elasticities for alcohol related mortality of -0.50, morbidity of -0.35 and lower
elasticities for alcohol related violence, traffic crashes, sexually transmitted diseases and crime.
These negative outcomes are probably more related to heavy drinking than to moderate
drinking. These results suggest that the effects of price on heavy drinking, while smaller than
the effects for moderate drinking, are not irrelevant.

Two prior studies of alcohol price effects are of particular interest since they provide
guidance for the empirical strategy adopted in this paper. In estimating differential effects for
heavy drinkers and other drinkers a key empirical concern is endogenous selection. Ayyagari et
al. (2009) employ a finite mixture model (FMM) which bypasses selection on the dependent
variable and requires only specification of the number of distinct population subgroups.
Manning et al. (1995) employ a quantile approach which also bypasses selection on the
dependent variable and simply requires definition of the quantiles. Interestingly, the results in
both of these papers is consistent with the behavioral economic model presented in this paper.
Also, both papers argue that the failure to differentiate policy effects by consumption level
conceals important information.

Ayyagari et al. (2009) investigates the price elasticity of demand for alcohol using Health
and Retirement Survey. They first estimate an overall price elasticity of -0.286 which is
4

somewhat lower than Wagenaar, Salois and Komro (2009) reported mean. Next, they estimate
a FMM with two components. The results for the first component show that a significant price
elasticity of -1.6. The first component included both drinkers and non-drinkers and comprises
75% of the sample. The average number of drinks per day in component one is 0.129. drinks
per day. In the second component price is not significant with an estimated elasticity of -0.035.
This component comprises 25% of the sample and the average number of drinks per day in
component two is 1.879 drinks per day. They conclude that there are two heterogeneous
groups in the population. Most individual are either non-drinkers or moderate drinkers with an
elastic demand for alcohol. However, a smaller group drinks more heavily and is unresponsive
to price.

Manning et al. (1995) specifically examined the effect of the level of alcohol consumption
on the price elasticity. They use the National Health Interview Survey with a weighted average
of ACCRA beer, wine, and spirits prices and a two-part model which separates the dichotomous
drinking participation decision from the choice of quantity consumed given participation. The
price variable in the participation equation is significant while it is not in the consumption given
participation equation. They estimate an overall participation elasticity of -0.55. Next, they
estimate a quantile regression using deciles of the consumption distribution. The results show
that the moderate drinkers have the highest price elasticity which is -1.19. The price elasticity
declines as consumption increases from the median quantile. The price is insignificant in the
quantile which includes the heaviest drinkers while all other quantiles are significant.

2. Theory
The theoretical model relies primarily on a theory of addiction and response to cues
based on neurological evidence presented in a paper by Bernheim and Rangel (2004). This
theory provides an advance in understanding how advertising affects alcohol consumption
5

decisions and provides guidance for the specific functional form of this relationship. There are
two key points in the theory. First, the theory argues that the role of advertising cues on alcohol
consumption is a consequence of the forecast of a hedonic effect from alcohol, rather than the
hedonic effect itself. Second, the theory argues that the forecast of a hedonic effect produced
by advertising cues is proportional to past consumption rather than the advertising cues
themselves.

The theoretical model employed in this paper assumes an analytically convenient fiction
of two distinct neurological systems which act simultaneously to produce a single decision.
These neurological systems have been given different labels such as system 1 and system 2
(Frederick and Kahneman, 2002) but will be referred to in this paper as the Hedonic system and
the Rational system. The Hedonic system is a simple system for learning correlations between
current conditions, decisions, and short-term rewards. It does not involve higher reasoning and
is present in lower life forms as well as humans. The Hedonic system is efficient at learning
simple action-reward correlations, but it is inflexible and unsophisticated in the sense that it can
only learn about a limited range of near-term consequences. When decisions must be made
very quickly, the Hedonic system dominates behavior. The main advantage of the Hedonic
system is that it can produce rapid decisions with generally beneficial near-term outcomes
provided that the environment is stable. It cannot, however, anticipate sufficiently delayed
consequences, and when the environment changes, it cannot ignore irrelevant past experiences
nor adjust forecasts prior to acquiring further experience. The Rational system develops causal
models of the world and reasons out the implications of different choices. The Rational system
needs time and cognitive resources to reason and make a choice. The Rational system
addresses the shortcomings of the Hedonic system, but is comparatively slow. Self-regulation
is a process which refers to the Rational system’s ability to override the Hedonic system and is
related to the more familiar concept of time preference.
6

There is an important distinction between non-addictive consumption goods and
addictive consumption goods in updating the Hedonic system. Individuals make consumption
choices based to some degree on past consumption experiences. When an individual
consumes a non-addictive good, there will be a post-consumption experience, which then
updates the Hedonic system. That is, there is learning from the post-consumption experience
and the predicted result of a future choice reflects this learning. However, an addictive
substance interferes with the normal operation of the Hedonic system with a direct chemical
effect on the process that leads the hedonic system to generate a choice. The consumption of
the addictive good affects the Hedonic system both through the post-consumption effect and the
direct chemical effect which distorts the learning process. The Hedonic system functions with
systematically skewed information which leads to mistakes in decision making. An individual
can try to compensate for this effect by exercising self-regulation, but cannot consciously correct
it. Individuals appear to achieve different balances between these mechanisms which may
result from differences in self-regulation and differences in the direct effect of alcohol on both
systems. This may be, in part, why some individuals become heavy drinkers while others drink
alcohol without excess.

External cues associated with consumption can produce a forecast of the hedonic effect
which is separate from the actual hedonic effect. Alcohol advertising is one form of external
cue. Bernheim and Rangel (2004) report on a series of neuroscience experiments on cues and
the level of hedonic forecasts. Hedonic forecasting occurs as a result of activity in a certain part
of the brain and is distinct from the hedonic experience itself. In these experiments, when
subjects are presented with a cue followed by a reward, there is a corresponding level of neural
activity. However, as experience with the reward continues, this neural activity occurs in
response to the cue rather than the reward. When the reward is increased, but the cue remains
7

constant, the neural activity increases in proportion to the new level of reward. That is, the
hedonic forecast is proportional to past levels of consumption rather than proportional to the
level of the cue. Thus, in the case of alcohol consumption, the same cue will produce a greater
response in heavy drinkers than is produced in moderate drinkers.

The theoretical model underlying the empirical work relies on the neurological processes
described above and on neoclassical economic theory. The model assumes that an individual
makes a choice regarding the consumption of alcohol and a non-addictive substance. The
consumption level chosen reflects a weighted average of consumption desired by the Hedonic
system and consumption desired by the Rational system. The weights are a function of cues,
past consumption and self-regulation. For clarity of exposition, consumption desired by the
Hedonic system is a function of only past consumption and consumption desired by the Rational
system is a function only of price. The theory can be represented by six relationships which are
assumed to be linear without intercepts.

Equation (1) shows that actual consumption (C) is a weighted average of desired
consumption by both systems. W h is the weight given to consumption desired by the Hedonic
system (Ch) and (W r) is consumption desired by the Rational system (Cr).
(1) C = W hCh + W rCr
The second relationship shows that the weight given to consumption desired by the Hedonic
system is a function of Cues, past consumption (PC) and self-regulation (SR). Cues can be
provided by alcohol advertising and alcohol portrayals on TV.
(2) W h = γ1Cues + γ2PC + γ3SR.
Since the two weights sum to one.
(3) W r = (1 – W h) = 1 - γ1Cues - γ2PC - γ3SR.

8

Consumption desired by the Hedonic system is determined by past consumption where α1
represents a heuristic process.
(4) Ch= α1PC.
The Rational system reflects the optimization of a standard constrained utility function.
Consumption desired by the Rational system is determined by price (P).
(5) Cr = β1P.
Substituting equations (2), (3), (4), and (5) into equation (1) results in the following estimable
relationship:
(6) C = λ1*P + λ2 SR*P + λ3 Cues*P + λ4 PC*P + λ5Cues*PC + λ6SR*PC.
Equation (6) drops one squared term which would not be included in an empirical model due to
potential problems with colinearity. Since the theory assumes that β1 and γ3 are negative, λ1, λ2,
and λ6 are negative while λ3 , λ4 and λ5 are positive.

The effect of price on consumption is shown by: ∂C/∂P = λ1 + λ2 SR + λ3 Cues + λ4 PC
λ1 is negative but since λ4 is positive, increases in past consumption offsets the negative effect
of price on consumption. Since λ3 is positive increases in Cues also offset the negative effect
of price. Self-regulation increases the negative effect of price since λ2 is negative. The effect
of Cues on consumption is shown by: ∂C/∂Cues = λ3P + λ5 PC + > 0. Since λ3 and λ5 are
positive, the effect of Cues on consumption is positive. An increase in past consumption will
increase the effect of Cues on consumption. The effect of self-regulation on consumption is
shown by: ∂C/∂SR = λ2 P + λ6PC < 0. Since λ2 and λ6 are negative, the effect of SR on
consumption is negative. However, counter intuitively, the model predicts that higher levels of
past consumption will increase the negative effect of self-regulation.

3. Data
The working data set is based on data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth
1997 (NLSY97) from 2002 to 2009. NLSY97 is an annual longitudinal, nationally representative
sample of 8984 individuals who were 12 to 16 years old as of December 31, 1996. The data
are representative of the entire population including those not in school. Price and advertising
data were merged to the NLSY97. The mean values and standard errors for all the variables
are presented in table 1.

The alcohol consumption variable is based on two consumption measures provided in
the NLSY97. The first measure is the number of days in the past thirty days that alcohol was
consumed (drinking days per month). The second measure is the usual number of drinks
consumed per day in the past thirty days (drinks per day). The empirical consumption variable
is the product of these two variables and is drinks per month. A number of prior studies have
used the same measure.

The independent variables from the NLSY97 measure economic, demographic, and
other factors that may impact alcohol consumption. These variables include continuous
measures of the respondent’s income, education and age and age squared. Also included are
dichotomous measures of the respondent’s gender, race, Hispanic ethnicity, marital status
school enrollment status and a variable for under age 21. The NLSY97 has TV watching in
years 2002 and 2007 which are reported as hours of TV watching per week. Data from Nielson
indicate that overall TV viewing time during the 2002-2009 period was relatively stable. Thus a
linear trend based on the 2002 and 2007 data for each individual was used to interpolate data
for 2003-2006 and to extrapolate data for 2008 and 2009. Weekly hours of TV watching were
multiplied by a value equal to the number of days in the month of interview divided by 7. This
converts TV watching to hours per month.
10

Education is usually included in a demand for alcohol equation as a proxy for health
knowledge but could be a proxy for self-regulation. Education could be a proxy for selfregulation since individuals who are better able to self-regulate have been shown to achieve
higher levels of educational success (Mischel, Shoda and Peake, 1988). This does not imply
that education has any casual effect on self-regulation. The ability to self-regulate is related to a
number of individual factors including genetics and experience. The estimation results for
education are compared to what would be expected if education proxied for self-regulation.

Both the probability of exposure to alcohol ads on TV and the probability of exposure to
alcohol portrayals in programming increase with the hours of TV watching. To model this
interaction the empirical proxy for alcohol cues on TV is an interaction term defined as the
product of hours of TV watching and hours of alcohol advertising on TV per month. This
variable (called All TV Cues) is a measure of the probability of exposure to alcohol cues on TV.
Hours of TV watching is also tested as a measure of exposure to alcohol cues. The TV
advertising data was purchased from Kantar Media and includes hours of alcohol ads on all
local and national TV. Local TV includes data from the top 101 local markets and national TV
includes Network TV, Syndicated TV and Cable network TV. Spanish Language TV was
excluded since it has a limited audience. The top 101 local markets account for about 82
percent of the US population. National ads have no local variation but have monthly and yearly
variation. Advertising is not defined as a stock since advertising is viewed in the behavioral
economics framework as an external cue which can result in a shift toward the Hedonic system.
The alcohol cue variable was appended to the NLSY97 by market, month and year.

The alcohol price data come from the American Chamber of Commerce Researchers
Association (ACCRA). The data are the price of a six pack of Heineken less any deposit and are
11

at the quarterly level for about 300 communities. These data were aggregated to the state level
to reduce measurement error associated with a small number of observations in each
community and adjusted for the 1983 CPI. These beer prices were appended to the NLSY97 by
state and quarter.

4. Estimation Issues and Results
The goal of the empirical work is to estimate the effects of price, cues and self-regulation
at different levels of past consumption. The inclusion of past consumption in the empirical
equation would create bias since past consumption is correlated with current consumption and
thus correlated with the equation error term. Stratifying the sample into two or more groups
based on the individual’s past consumption would also create bias due to endogenous selection
which is again due to the correlation between current consumption and past consumption.
However, the correlation between past and current consumption can be used to advantage with
FMM and quantile regression. These methods allow for estimation of the effects of the
independent variables at different levels of current consumption without stratification of the
sample. Since higher levels of current consumption are associated with higher levels of past
consumption, FMM and Quantile regressions may provide estimates of the effects of the
independent variables at different levels of past consumption. The empirical models drop the
interaction terms with price from equation (6) since, in log form, they are too collinear with the
log of price.

To verify that current and lagged consumption are correlated in the NLSY97 data a
regression of the natural log of lagged alcohol consumption on the natural log of current alcohol
consumption, its square and a constant was estimated. This regression resulted in an intercept
of 1.226, a coefficient of 0.474 on current alcohol consumption and a coefficient of 0.0228 for
the squared term. All coefficients were significant at the 1 percent level and the R-squared was
12

.35. This regression was used to predict values of past consumption using current consumption
for nine deciles of current consumption. Predicted past consumption increases with each decile
of actual past consumption and with each decile of current consumption. Thus, on average for
each decile, higher values of current consumption are associated with higher values of past
consumption making current consumption a good ordinal proxy for past consumption.

The first set of results presented are for the FMM estimation of equation (6). The FMM
approach is useful as a test for two or more underlying distributions which represent
heterogeneous subsamples or components in the overall sample. This approach requires only
specification of the number of components and the probability distribution for each component.
The estimated mean value of the dependent variable in each component provides a natural
interpretation of what the component represents. The components may or may not represent
significantly different alcohol consumption levels. However, Ayyagari et al. (2009) employed the
FMM approach to estimate an alcohol demand function with two components and found that the
two components differed significantly by consumption level and the components can thus be
interpreted as moderate consumption and heavy consumption.

The FMM results presented in table 2 assume two components each with a normal
distribution. Since natural log transformations of alcohol consumption, alcohol price and alcohol
advertising are employed, the resulting coefficients represent elasticities. These elasticities are
for consumption, conditional on positive consumption. Clustered standard errors at the
individual level were employed. The results show that the probability that an individual is in
component 1 is .69 and the mean value of alcohol consumption for component 1 is 8.08 drinks
per month (2.09 in logs). The predicted past consumption for component 1 is 10.45 drinks per
month. The results also show that the probability that an individual is in component 2 is .31 and
the average consumption in component 2 is 40 drinks per month (3.69 in logs). The predicted
13

past consumption for component 2 is 27.23 drinks per month. Thus component 1 can be
interpreted as consisting of individuals with moderate levels of current and past consumption
and component 2 can be interpreted as consisting of individuals with high levels of current and
past consumption. The coefficients estimated for component 1 can be interpreted as relevant to
individuals with moderate levels of past consumption and the coefficients estimated for
component 2 can be interpreted as relevant to individuals with high levels of past consumption.

The results show that moderate drinkers have a price elasticity of -.49 and that the price
elasticity for heavy drinkers is insignificant. These results are consistent with the theoretical
model which predicts that an increase in past consumption decreases the negative effect of
price on current consumption. The results also show that in component 1 the alcohol cues
elasticity is significant and equal to .05. and in component 2 the alcohol cues elasticity is
significant and equal to .10. This is also consistent with the theoretical model which predicts
that an increase in past consumption increases the positive effect of advertising on
consumption. These results are also consistent with the review by Gallet (2007) who found an
average alcohol price elasticity of -0.535 and alcohol advertising elasticity of .03. The estimates
reported by Gallet do not distinguish between heavy and moderate consumption and therefore
primarily reflect moderate drinkers since moderate drinkers predominate in any random sample.

It was argued above that education may be a proxy for self-regulation. The theoretical
model predicts that an increase in past consumption increases the negative effect of selfregulation on consumption. The results show that for drinkers with a low level of past
consumption, both education and current enrollment in school are insignificant but both
variables are negative and significant for drinkers with a high level of past consumption. The
larger negative effect for drinkers with higher levels of past consumption is consistent with the
interpretation of education as a proxy for self-regulation.
14

The theoretical model has no predictions with respect to the effect of past consumption
on the other included independent variables. The results show that age has a positive effect on
moderate drinkers maximizing at age 25.8. However, age has no effect on heavy drinking.
Being underage has a negative effect on moderate drinkers but no effect on heavy drinkers.
Similarly, being Hispanic has a negative effect for moderate drinkers but no effect on heavy
drinkers. Income has a positive effect for moderate drinkers but a negative effect for heavy
drinkers. Marriage and being Black has a negative effect for both moderate and heavy drinkers.
Finally, being male has a positive effect for both moderate and heavy drinkers.

The FMM approach also allows for estimation of the influence of each independent
variable on the probability that an individual is in component 1. These results show that the
probability of being a moderate drinker is increased for those who are married, black or Hispanic
but decreased for males. These results parallel the results from the two components. The
remaining variables have no significant influence on the probability of being a moderate drinker
rather than a heavy drinker.

Table 3 presents two alternative specifications of the alcohol demand function estimated
with FMM. The model in panel A of table 3 includes all of the independent variables in table 2
and also includes state dummies. The results in panel A are essentially the same as those of
table 2 with the exception that the price coefficients are no longer significant. The loss of
significance for price is probably due to the limited time variation in the state level price data.
Panel B of table 3 includes all of the independent variables in table 2 but employs the natural
log of TV watching as the measure of exposure to alcohol cues on TV. The results in panel B
are the same as those of table 2 with respect to sign and significance but differ in magnitude.

15

The coefficient of TV watching for component 1 is larger than the TV Cues variable in table 3
and the difference between component 1 and 2 is not significant.

As noted in the introduction, Ayyagari et al. (2009) estimated price elasticities for a
sample which included non-drinkers. However, they also estimated priced elasticities for a
sample limited to drinkers. They used FMM with two components and their data are limited to
individuals over age 50. In the full sample they found that the probability of being in component
1 was .60 and the probability of being in component 2 was .40. Mean consumption levels for
the two components of the drinkers only sample were not provided although they state that
component 1 is the larger group and can be assumed that it is also the moderate drinkers. In
the sample limited to drinkers, the price elasticity in component 1 was -0.63 and the price
elasticity in component 2 was not significant. These elasticity results are very similar to the
results found with the younger NLSY97 sample used in this paper. Ayyagari et al. (2009) also
present results for the two components, for education, using several alternative specifications
and results for a variable defined as a longer financial planning horizon using one specification.
A longer financial planning horizon is related to time preference and could also be a proxy for
self-regulation. In all the results education and the longer financial planning horizon are positive
in component 1 and negative in component 2. Education and the financial planning horizon
increase the probability of drinking in component 1 which is due to the inclusion of non-drinkers.
The negative effect for component 2 is consistent with the prediction that past consumption
increases the negative effect of self-regulation. These results suggest that education and
financial planning horizon are proxies for self-regulation. Similar results for education were
found with the NLSY97.

The second approach used to estimate equation (6) is quantile regression. The quantile
regression estimator uses all of the sample observations and thus does not require sample
16

stratification. The quantile regression estimates the marginal effects of the independent
variables at pre-specified quantiles of the dependent variable. These quantiles are simply
percentiles. The quantile regression results are presented in tables 4 and 5 and employ the
same specifications used in tables 2 and 3. Again, the natural log of alcohol consumption,
alcohol price and alcohol cues on TV are employed and the coefficients represent elasticities for
consumption given that consumption is positive. The quantile results for the 10th to the 90th
quantiles are presented. Robust bootstrap standard errors are included based on 400
repetitions.

Table 4 includes alcohol price elasticities, alcohol cues elasticities and results for
education. The price elasticities are all negative and four of these price elasticities are
significant. The price elasticities show a general pattern of decline from the 10th quantile to the
90th quantile and are all insignificant after the 60th quantile. That is, the price elasticity declines
as current and past consumption increase which is predicted by the theoretical model. At the
30th quantile the price elasticity is -0.506 which is the very close to the price elasticity estimated
in component 1 with the FMM approach. The alcohol cues elasticities are all positive and
significant. The cues elasticities show a general pattern of increase from the 10th quantile to the
90th quantile. That is, the alcohol cues elasticity increases as past consumption increases
which is also predicted by the theoretical model. At the 30th quantile the cues elasticity is .058
and at the 80th quantile the cues elasticity is .105. These are close to the values reported for
component 1 and component 2 in the FMM results. The education coefficients are negative and
significant which shows that education reduces consumption. The coefficients increase in
absolute value from the 10th quantile to the 90th quantile which shows that the effect of
education increases as past consumption increases. At the 30th quantile an extra year of
education reduces consumption by about 2% but at the 80th quantile an extra year of education
reduces consumption by about 7%. Enrolled is insignificant from the 10th to the 70th quantile
17

and then is negative and significant. This is the pattern expected for self-regulation which
supports the hypothesis that education is a proxy for self-regulation and is similar to the FMM
results.

The other variables in table 4 include age variables which are generally not significant
but the underage variable is negative and significant in five of the nine quantiles. Income is
positive and significant in the 10th through the 70th quantile and decreases as alcohol
consumption increases. The demographic variables, Black, Hispanic and Married are all
negative and significant in almost all quantiles. Male is positive and significant in all quantiles.

The quantile coefficients can be tested for significant differences between quantiles.
These tests were done with the results from table 4 with a null hypothesis of no difference
between the coefficients. The null hypothesis is rejected when the p values are .10 or less.
This test was performed on the coefficients of price and TV Cues for all the permutations of
quantile combinations. The results of these tests show that for price only the 10th and 90th
quantiles are significantly different. However, for TV Cues, most quantiles which were two or
more deciles apart were significantly different.

Table 5 presents two alternative specifications of the alcohol demand function estimated
with quantile regressions. The model in panel A of table 5 includes all of the independent
variables in table 4 and also includes state dummies. The results in panel A are essentially the
same as those of table 4 with the exception that the price coefficients are no longer significant
which parallel the results in panel A of table 3. Panel B of table 5 includes all of the independent
variables in table 4 but employs the natural log of TV watching as the measure of exposure to
alcohol cues on TV. The results in panel B are the same as those of table 4 with respect to
sign and significance but differ in magnitude. The coefficient of TV watching for the 10 quantile
18

is significantly different than the coefficient for the 80th and 90th quantile. These results support
the theoretical model.

As noted in the introduction, Manning et al. (1995) estimated alcohol price elasticities
with quantile regressions. They found the highest price elasticity was at the 50th quantile which
declined moving to both extremes. They reported a conditional price elasticity at the 50th
quantile of -0.64 and approximately zero at the 90th quantile. The hypothesis of equality of
these two coefficients is rejected. Using the NLSY97 data the conditional price elasticity at the
50th quantile is -0.72, at the 60th quantile is -.53 and approximately zero at higher quantiles.
Manning et al. also report the effect of four or more years of college on alcohol consumption. It
is negative and significant at the 5th and 95th quantile and increases in absolute value as alcohol
consumption increases. These results are consistent with the assertion that education is a
proxy for self-regulation and similar to results for education which were found with the NLSY97.

5. Conclusions
The distribution of alcohol consumption indicates that most individuals who drink are
moderate drinkers and only a minority of individuals are heavy drinkers. An efficient alcohol
control policy would target these heavy drinkers since this group is responsible for much of the
social costs of alcohol. Moderate alcohol consumption probably causes no harm and might be
beneficial to health. The reduction of alcohol cues in the form of TV advertising and TV
placements and the increase in alcohol price through higher excise taxes are important alcohol
control options and are the primary focus of this paper. All of the prior studies of alcohol
advertising focus on average consumption and most of the prior studies of taxes and price focus
on average consumption. The focus on average consumption is based on the implicit
assumption that lower average consumption implies lower consumption at the upper end of the
distribution.
19

The behavioral economic model presented in this paper argues that the effect of
advertising and price differ by past consumption levels. The model predicts that advertising is
more effective in reducing consumption at high past consumption levels but less effective at low
past consumption levels. Conversely, the model predicts that higher prices are effective in
reducing consumption at low past consumption levels but less effective at high past
consumption levels. Past consumption levels and current consumption levels are highly
correlated and thus current consumption is a good ordinal proxy for past consumption. Unlike
the models used in most prior studies, this model predicts that the effects of policy on average
consumption and on the upper end of the distribution are different.

Both FMM and Quantile models were estimated. The results from these regressions
show that heavy drinkers are more responsive to advertising and less responsive to price than
are moderate drinkers. The empirical evidence also supports the assumption that education is
a proxy for self-regulation. The key conclusions are that restrictions on advertising are targeted
at heavy drinkers and are an underutilized alcohol control policy. Higher excise taxes on
alcohol reduce consumption by moderate drinkers and are of less importance in reducing heavy
consumption.

The empirical results are not proof of the behavioral model since the estimated
specifications could have been generated by alternative theoretical models. However, there is
also laboratory evidence supporting the behavioral model. If the behavioral model is an
accurate representation of behavior there is an additional implication about the effect of cues on
alcohol consumption. In the neoclassical approach, advertising is information which can change
perceptions of the product and act as a complement to consumption. In this view, the various
streams of information about alcohol are rationally weighed and according to revealed
20

preference the individual’s observed consumption is optimal. In the behavioral economic model,
advertising is a cue which increases the probability that alcohol consumption is heuristically
determined. In the behavioral model the effects of advertising are not easily dismissed by
heavy drinkers. The conclusion from the behavioral economic model is that advertising induced
consumption is not optimal for all individuals and may be a particular concern for those drinkers
most at risk from alcohol.
