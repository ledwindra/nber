This paper considers the history and historiography of Bretton Woods from three perspectives. First, I ask how the questions posed today about the operation of Bretton Woods differ from those asked twenty years ago. Second, I explore how today's answers to familiar questions differ from the answers offered in the past. Third, I examine the implications of Bretton Woods experience for international monetary reform.\n\n",
