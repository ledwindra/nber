    "abstract": "\n\nWe evaluate the role of insider ownership in shaping banks\u2019 equity issuances in response to the global financial crisis. We construct a unique dataset on the ownership structure of U.S. banks and their equity issuances and discover that greater insider ownership leads to less equity issuances. Several tests are consistent with the view that bank insiders are reluctant to reduce their private benefits of control by diluting their ownership through equity issuances. Given the connection between bank equity and lending, the results stress that ownership structure can shape the resilience of banks\u2014and hence the entire economy\u2014to aggregate shocks.\n\n",
