    "abstract": "\n\nCollege admissions in many countries are based on a centrally administered test. Applicants invest a great deal of resources to improve their performance on the test, and there is growing concern about the large costs associated with these activities. We consider modifying such tests by introducing performance-disclosure policies that pool intervals of performance rankings, and investigate how such policies can improve students\u2019 welfare in a Pareto sense. Pooling a\ufb00ects the equilibrium allocation of studentso colleges, which hurts some students and bene\ufb01ts others, but also a\ufb00ects the e\ufb00ort students exert. We characterize the Pareto frontier of Pareto improving policies, and also identify improvements that are robust to the distribution of college seats.\nWe illustrate the potential applicability of our results with an empirical estimation that uses data on college admissions in Turkey. We \ufb01nd that a policy that pools a large fraction of the lowest performing students leads to a Pareto improvement in a contest based on the estimated parameters. We then conduct a laboratory experiment based on the estimated parameters to examine the e\ufb00ect of such pooling on subjects\u2019 behavior. The \ufb01ndings generally support our theoretical predictions. Our work suggests that identifying and introducing Pareto improving performance-disclosure policies may be a feasible and practical way to improve college admissions based on centralized tests.\n\n",
