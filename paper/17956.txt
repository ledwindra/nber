NBER Working Paper No. 17956
March 2012, Revised June 2013
JEL No. E3,E4
ABSTRACT
Recent empirical work suggests that small price changes are relatively common. This evidence has
been used to criticize classic menu-cost models. In this paper, we use scanner data from a national
supermarket chain and micro data from the Consumer Price Index to reassess the importance of small
price changes. We argue that the vast majority of these changes are due to measurement error. We
conclude that the evidence on the prevalence of small price changes is much too weak to be used as
a litmus test of nominal rigidity models.

1. Introduction
A classic issue in macroeconomics is how monetary policy a§ects economic activity. In many monetary models, inertia in nominal prices plays a key role in
the monetary transmission mechanism. However, the literature has not reached
a consensus on the micro-foundations of this inertia. Competing theories emphasize menu costs, rational inattention, sticky information, costs of re-optimizing
and implementing new plans, and the negative reaction of consumers to large
price changes.1
In the past decade there has been an explosion of work using detailed micro
data sets to assess the plausibility of alternative models of price rigidity. An
important finding in this literature is that firms often make small price changes.2
This finding is inconsistent with classic menu-cost models.
There is a large literature aimed at developing variants of menu-cost models
that can generate small price changes. For example, Dotsey, King, and Wolman
(1999) and Caballero and Engel (1999) assume that the cost of changing price is
stochastic. So, when the cost is low, firms might make small price changes. Lach
and Tsiddon (2007), Midrigan (2011), and Alvarez and Lippi (2012) consider
multi-product firms with economies of scope in price setting. Small price changes
arise naturally in these models because once a firm pays a fixed menu cost, it can
adjust the prices of more than one good.

In this paper we address the empirical question: just how prevalent are small
price changes? Using a new data set from a large U.S. supermarket retailer,
we argue that the distribution of price changes is quite sensitive to a form of
measurement error that arises in many scanner data sets. This error arises from
the use of price measures constructed as unit value indices (UVIs), i.e. the ratio
of sales revenue from a product to the quantity sold.3 A unique feature of our
data set is that it has both the prices and quantities sold in each transaction.
We show that UVI-based pricing induces a leftward shift in the distribution
of price changes. A researcher using UVI-based prices would infer that there are
many more small price changes and fewer large price changes than actually exist.
In addition, the use of UVI prices induces a significant downward bias in the
median size of price changes, a result that is particularly relevant to researchers
calibrating menu-cost models.
To assess the robustness of our inference about the prevalence of small price
changes, we also consider the Consumer Price Index (CPI) research data set collected by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Again, we argue that the
evidence of frequent small price changes is illusory.
In the CPI data set, spurious small price changes arise from a variety of measurement problems. These problems fall into four broad categories. First, some
prices are computed using UVIs. Second, some quoted prices pertain to bundles of
goods. Third, some prices refer to goods sold at points of service that change over
time. Finally, some prices are non-transactional or are a§ected by uncontrolled
forms of quality changes. In practice, the first two categories are, by far, the most
important. In Section 3, we provide examples of CPI items that are subject to
3

In some scanner data sets, such as the Dominicks data set, the weekly price of an item
is chosen according to an algorithm based on the share of sales that occur at various prices.
Changes in these shares induce spurious changes in reported prices of an individual item. We
thank an anonymous referee for drawing our attention to this fact.

2

these forms of measurement error and discuss why they lead to spurious small
price changes. We show that removing the problematic CPI items has a large
impact on inference about the prevalence of small price changes.
The definition of what constitutes a “small” price change is, inevitably, somewhat arbitrary. In our empirical work, we study price changes that are smaller, in
absolute terms, than 1, 2.5, and 5 percent. These values are those considered by
Klenow and Kryvtsov (2008, table 4). Our qualitative conclusions hold regardless
of which of these values are used to define a small price change. For concreteness,
we focus our discussion on price changes that are less than 1 percent in absolute
value, which we refer to as small price changes. As a reference point, the average
rate of inflation over the period that our CPI data covers (January 1988 to July
2011) is 2.9 percent and 2.7 percent for headline and core inflation, respectively.
The fraction of small price changes in the CPI data set is 12.5 and 14 percent
for posted and regular prices, respectively. These fractions are very close to those
reported by Klenow and Kryvtsov (2008). Removing problematic CPI items has
a dramatic impact on the fraction of small price changes: this fraction declines to
3.6 and 5 percent, for posted and regular prices, respectively.
Interestingly, these statistics are in line with early findings by Kashyap (1995)
on the fraction of price changes that are small. He finds that 2.7 percent of
price changes are smaller than 1 percent. Significantly, his evidence is based on
retail catalogs which do not su§er from most of the measurement error issues
that arise in problematic categories of CPI goods. Carlton (1986) reports much
higher percentages of small price changes than Kashyap (1995). However, there is
a crucial di§erence between their studies. Carlton’s data pertains to transactions
between firms (the buyers are typically Fortune 500 firms). Moreover, with the
exception of household appliances and truck motors, the goods in his data are
commodities for which sticky prices are, presumably, not very important.
3

Our results are also consistent with the findings in Cavallo (2010) and Cavallo
and Rigobon (2011) which are based on scrapped price data. Cavallo (2010) reports that the share of price changes that are smaller than one percent in absolute
value is 4.2 percent in Argentina, 4.3 percent in Brazil, and 3.6 percent in Chile.
Using a data set that spans 23 countries and 5 continents, Cavallo and Rigobon
(2011) find that the median fraction of price changes smaller than one percent in
absolute value is 3.8 percent.
Viewed as a whole, our results from the scanner and CPI data sets are consistent with the view that most small price changes are artifacts of measurement
error. To the extent that such changes occur, they are far too rare to be used as a
litmus test for evaluating the plausibility of menu-cost models or its competitors.
This paper is organized as follows. We discuss our results for scanner data and
CPI data in Sections 2 and 3, respectively. Section 4 concludes.

2. Spurious small price changes in scanner data
An important source of evidence regarding the distribution of price changes is
scanner data.4 The price of an item is generally not directly recorded in these
data sets. In many data sets, such as those used by Eichenbaum, Jaimovich,
and Rebelo (2011), Burstein and Jaimovich (2011), and Gopinath, Itskhoki, and
Rigobon (2010), researchers compute the price of an item as an UVI, i.e. they
divide total sales of a product by quantity sold.
Computing prices in this way can generate spurious small price changes. Suppose that di§erent consumers buy the same good at di§erent prices. Then a
small change in consumer composition can lead to a spurious small price change.
4

See, for example, Burstein and Hellwig (2007), Campbell and Eden (2007), Nakamura
(2008), Broda and Weinstein (2010), Midrigan (2011), and Eichenbaum, Jaimovich, and Rebelo (2011).

This problem is particularly acute with respect to supermarket transactions for
three reasons. First, some items are sold at a discount to customers who have
a loyalty card. Second, some items are discounted with coupons. Third, there
are “two-for-one” types of promotions. Changes in the fraction of customers who
take advantage of these types of discounts induce spurious changes in UVI-based
prices.
To gauge the potential importance of this type of measurement error, we use
a new data set related to the one in Eichenbaum, Jaimovich, and Rebelo (2011).
They use a scanner data set from a large food and drug retailer that operates more
than 1,000 stores in di§erent U.S. states and covers the period from 2004 to 2006.
It contains observations on weekly quantities and sales revenue for roughly 60,000
items in each of the retailer’s stores. By an item we mean a good, as defined by
its universal product code (UPC), in a particular store. Most of the items in this
data set are in the processed food, unprocessed food, household furnishings, and
“other goods” categories of the CPI.
Here we use a new data set from the same retailer which contains the actual
price associated with each transaction for 374 stores in Arizona, California, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming, for the period from January 4, 2004 to
December 31, 2004. Because prices are observed directly, there is no measurement
error associated with time-varying uses of discounts, coupons, loyalty cards, and
other promotions. Also, the price is not produced using a revenue-share-based
algorithm, as in the Dominicks data set, and so it is not subject to spurious price
changes induced by such algorithms.
We are interested in understanding whether a given good is sold at di§erent
prices on a given day. To this end, we identify all UPC/Stores/Days that appear
for at least 7 days and in which at least 3 units were sold in each day. Applying
these criteria to the data set leaves us with 1.7 million transactions. In 70 percent
5

of these observations, the same good is sold at the same price in all transactions
that occur in the same store and on the same day. In the remaining 30 percent of
observations, the same good is sold at more than one price on the same day. As
discussed previously, these di§erent prices could reflect a¢nity purchases, coupons
or other promotions.
We compute summary statistics for the daily distribution of the price of each
good: the maximum, minimum and modal price of a product. These statistics
do not involve averaging the underlying prices. To assess the measurement error
induced by the use of UVIs, we proceed as follows. First, we construct UVI-based
prices using our data set. For every day in our sample we divide total sales revenue
for item i in store j by the total quantity sold of item i in store j. Second, we
compute the absolute percentage price change for the constructed UVI prices.
Figure 1 displays the cumulative distribution of changes in these constructed
UVI prices, as well as in the minimum, maximum and modal prices. Figure 2
displays the empirical distribution of price changes for the modal and UVI-based
prices. In all cases, the distributions displayed are conditional on there being a
price change.
Figures 1 and 2 show that the distribution of price changes is quite sensitive
to the use of UVI prices. The cumulative distribution function for changes in
UVI prices is significantly above the cumulative distribution of changes in the
maximum, minimum and modal price. This di§erence is particularly stark for all
price changes less than 10 percent in absolute value. Figure 2 shows that UVIbased pricing induces a leftward shift in the distribution of prices. There are, in
fact, many more large price changes and many fewer small price changes than one
would infer using UVI-based pricing.

6

The size of median price changes According to Figure 1, the median change
in UVI-based prices is roughly 10 percent. This value is very close to the one used
by Golosov and Lucas (2007) and Midrigan (2011) in calibrating their models.
Figure 1 indicates that the actual median price change is roughly 30 percent.5
So, according to this data set, actual median price changes appear to be larger
than the number used to calibrate menu-cost models. This result indicates that
calibrations based on scanner data can be quite sensitive to the UVI problem.
The number of small price changes There is no unique definition of what
constitutes a small price change. Recall that Klenow and Kryvtsov (2008, table
4) use threshold values of 1, 2.5, and 5 percent to define a small price change. In a
similar vein, Midrigan (2011, page 1160) uses threshold values of 3 and 5 percent.
So, for robustness, we report results using 1, 2.5 and 5 percent as our small price
thresholds.
Figure 1 indicates that 31.5 percent of the changes in the constructed UVI
prices are smaller than 5 percent in absolute terms. The actual fraction of price
changes smaller than 5 in absolute value is 5.2 percent.6 The analogous numbers
for the 1 percent threshold are 8.4 and 1.7. Clearly, using UVI-based prices leads
the analyst to greatly overstate the frequency of small price changes. So, we are
skeptical of evidence on the prevalence of small price changes that is based on
scanner data.
One can always question the representativeness of the goods covered by scanner
data. So, in the next section we assess the robustness of inference about small
5

There are three median price changes depending on how prices are measured. Using the
maximum, modal and minimum price measure, the median price change is 23, 28, and 38
percent, respectively. The average of these numbers is 30 percent. The percentage of price
changes smaller than one percent is 1.6, 2.5, and 1.1 percent for the maximum, modal and
minimum price, respectively.

This statistic is computed as the average of the fraction of small price changes in the minimum, maximum, and medium price.

3. Evidence from the CPI
Our analysis is based on an updated version of the BLS’s CPI research database used by Klenow and Kryvtsov (2008). This database covers the non-shelter
component of the CPI. Our sample period is from January 1988 to July 2011.
The basic unit of observation is the price of a particular item at a specific
location and point in time; for example, a 64-ounce bottle of New Planet Organics
Apple Juice purchased in a particular Whole Foods store in Chicago. A time series
of price quotes for a particular item is called a ‘quote-line.’ The BLS collects
observations on quote-lines on a monthly basis in New York, Los Angeles, and
Chicago and on a bimonthly basis in other urban areas. The BLS organizes quotelines into categories called entry-level items (ELIs). For example, ELI TA011 is
New Cars. An example of a quote-line within this ELI might be a 2005 Ford Focus
LX Sedan with a particular set of features as outlined in the BLS ELI checklist.
The BLS distinguishes between posted and regular prices. Posted prices include temporary price changes that the BLS flags as “sales.” Regular prices are
non-sale prices.
Tables 1 and 2 present our main results on small price changes for posted and
regular prices, respectively.7 We compute the percentage of price changes in the
CPI data set that are smaller, in absolute value, than 1, 2.5, and 5 percent. We
report both the raw number of small price changes and the weighted percentage
of price changes in parentheses, weighted by the importance of di§erent ELI categories in consumer expenditures. Unless we state otherwise, we proceed as in
Klenow and Kryvtsov (2008) and compute statistics applying sampling weights to

See Nakamura and Steinsson (2008) for a detailed analysis of the di§erent properties of
posted and regular prices in the CPI.

items within ELIs.8 In computing the weighted percentage of small price changes
we remove problematic price changes from both the numerator and the denominator.
In what follows, we focus our discussion on the fraction of price changes that
are less than 1 percent in absolute value. The analogous results for 2.5 and
5 percent thresholds are reported in Tables 1 and 2. We begin by discussing
changes in posted prices. In our data set there are a total of 1, 047, 547 price
changes out of 4, 791, 569 price observations, implying a raw frequency of price
changes equal to 22 percent. The weighted frequency of price changes is also 22
percent. Abstracting from Jensen’s inequality, this frequency implies an average
price duration of 4.5 months. There are 69, 720 posted small price changes less
that one percent in our data set. These represent 12.5 percent (6.7 percent) of all
weighted (unweighted) price changes.9
We now examine the extent to which the observed small changes in posted
prices can be attributed to various forms of measurement error. First, there are
8, 703 price changes that are less than a penny. These changes are clearly due to
measurement error. Eliminating them reduces the candidate pool of small price
changes from 69, 720 to 61, 017. Second, we eliminate 1, 243 observations that
are flagged by the BLS because the new price pertains to a substitute item or
a quality adjustment has been made. We eliminate these observations because
small di§erences between the substitute and original item or small errors in the
quality adjustment result in spurious small price changes.10 Eliminating these
8

We use the weights reported by Klenow and Kryvtsov (2008), which are available at:
http://klenow.com/KK_Frequencies.xls
9
The weighted fraction of price changes smaller than one percent in absolute value reported
by Klenow and Kryvtsov (2008, table IV) is 11.3 percent and 12.1 percent for posted and
regular price changes, respectively. They do not report the analogue statistic for unweighted
price changes.
10
We eliminate these items by restricting our sample to items for which the BLS flag COMP
is equal to CC. Other potential values for COMP include COMP = QC, which means there is

9

observations leaves us with 59, 774 candidate small price changes.
Third, we identified a set of 27 problematic ELIs that are subject to types of
measurement error that generate spurious small price changes. These ELIs account for roughly 77 percent of the candidate small price changes. The remaining
23 percent small price changes are spread across many potentially problematic
ELIs for which it was impossible to obtain detailed documentation. In what follows, we adopt the conservative assumption that the small price changes in these
ELIs are not spurious. We eliminate the small price changes in the 27 problematic
ELIs. Doing so leaves us with 13, 518 small price changes. Since these problematic
ELIs account for the vast majority of the small price changes, it is important to
discuss them in more detail. We return to this issue below.
Panel A of Figure 3 displays, for posted prices, the impact of eliminating
small changes in problematic ELIs. The (1,1) element of this panel shows two
distributions. The first pertains to price changes across all the ELIs. Notice that
a substantial fraction of these price changes fall between 1 and +1 percent. The

second distribution results from removing all price changes that are less than one
percent for troublesome ELIs. Notice that a much smaller fraction of price changes
now lies between 1 and +1 percent.

One might be concerned that the dip around zero in the second distribution

is an artifact of eliminating the small price changes for the troublesome ELIs. To
address this concern we display in the (1,2) element of panel A a third distribution,
obtained by eliminating all of the problematic ELIs from the sample. Like the
second distribution, the third distribution has a much smaller fraction of price
changes between 1 and +1 percent than the first distribution. The second and

third distributions appear more bimodal than the first distribution. Interestingly,
the shape of these distributions is similar to those displayed in Cavallo (2000) and
a quality adjustment, or COMP = SR, which means that there is a substitution.

10

Cavallo and Rigobon (2011).
Viewed overall, the net e§ect of our corrections for posted prices is to reduce
the ratio of small price changes to all price changes from an unweighted 6.7 percent
to 1.3 percent. The analogue statistic for weighted price changes falls from 12.5
percent to 3.6 percent.
We now turn our attention to regular prices. There are 4,708,719 regular
price observations in our data set. According to Table 2, there are 636, 728 price
changes, representing 13.5 percent of all price observations. So, the frequency of
regular price changes is 13.5 percent, implying an average price duration of 7.4
months.

There are 66, 906 regular small price changes less than one percent,

which represents a weighted (unweighted) fraction of 14 (10) percent of all price
changes. The analogue statistic in Klenow and Kryvtsov (2008) is roughly 12
percent. Proceeding as above, we eliminate subsets of those observations that we
think are due to measurement error. First, there are 7, 696 price changes that are
less than a penny. Second, we eliminate 1, 167 observations flagged by the BLS
because the new price pertains to a substitute item or a quality adjustment has
been made. Third, we eliminate 45, 849 small price changes in the problematic
ELIs. After these corrections, we are left with 12, 194 small price changes. Panel
B of Figure 3 is the analogue of panel A for regular price changes and displays a
similar pattern of results.
Viewed overall, the net e§ect of our corrections for regular prices is to reduce
the ratio of small price changes to all price changes from a unweighted 10 percent
to 2 percent. The analogue statistic for weighted price changes falls from 14
percent to 5 percent.
It is interesting to ask the question: do small price changes occur in ELIs whose
prices change infrequently? This type of behavior would be inconsistent with
simple menu cost models. In fact the answer to this question is no. Figure 4 shows
11

that, for regular prices in the problematic ELIs, there is a positive correlation (76
percent) between the frequency of price adjustment and the fraction of small
price changes.11 So, small price changes are more likely to occur in ELIs where
prices change frequently. For example, the price of “Utility Natural Gas Service,”
has an average duration of one month and a large fraction (15 percent) of price
changes that are small. In contrast, “College Tuition and Fixed Fees,” has an
average price duration of 12 months and a very small fraction (one percent) of
small price changes. The correlation between the frequency of price adjustment
and the fraction of small price changes within the problematic ELIs is 70 percent
for posted prices.
Understanding the problematic ELIs Clearly, the problematic ELIs are the
major source of measurement error in computing small price changes. While
they account for roughly 25 percent of all price observations, they account for 77
percent of all small price changes. So, it is clearly important to discuss why the
problematic ELIs are likely to be associated with spurious small price changes.
The problematic ELIs fall into four categories. Category 1 consists of prices
computed as UVIs. Category 2 consists of prices that pertain to a bundle of goods.
Category 3 consists of prices for goods that, at least prior to 2007, were sold at
points of service that change over time. Category 4 includes miscellaneous forms
of measurement error, such as non-transactional prices or uncontrolled forms of
quality changes.
In practice, some ELIs can be placed in more than one category. Table 3 lists
the problematic ELIs and the major category to which we assign them. Some
of these assignments are based on the BLS documentation cited below. Others
11

The correlation between the frequency of regular price adjustment and the fraction of small
regular price changes across all ELIs is 0.62. Interestingly, this correlation is only 0.32 for posted
prices. This lower correlation presumably reflects the e§ects of sales.

12

are based on discussions with BLS o¢cials. As a check on our classifications,
we reviewed with BLS o¢cials the ELIs that we classify as problematic to receive
feedback from them about our interpretation of the nature of measurement error.12
Categories 1 and 2 are, by far, the most important source of spurious small
price changes. These two categories alone account for 90 percent of the small price
changes in problematic ELIs.
Table 3 lists the nine ELIs that are subject to the UVI problem. These ELIs account for approximately 45 percent of the posted and regular small price changes.
A concrete example of an item whose price is computed as an UVI is cellular
telephones services, which is part of Interstate Telephone Services (ELI ED021).
According to the BLS: “Data supplied by some cellular providers to the CPI (as
well as the data shared by the PPI) are types of average revenue figures from
the company’s internal computer system. Some cellular companies feel average
revenue is a good pricing measure since it encompasses many di§erent customers,
and a wide array of cellular calling characteristics. These data may be supplied
as average revenue per minute, per customer, per bill, or per account.”13
From Table 3 we see that 11 ELIs are subject to the composite-good problem.
These ELIs account for approximately 23 percent of the regular and posted small
price change observations. An example of a composite-good ELI is Airline Fares
(ELI TG011). The price paid by the consumer for an airplane ticket includes the
price charged by the airline as well as a myriad of taxes and fees, such as the
September 11 security fee, a passenger facility fee, the Federal excise tax, a travel
facilities tax, a Federal Domestic flight segment fee, and departure and arrival
fees. These taxes or fees often represent a very small percent of the price charged
by the airline. A change in these taxes or fees would result in a small change in
12
13

To be clear, the BLS has not o¢cially endorsed our classification.
See http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpifactc.htm

13

the price recorded by the BLS, even though the airline did not change its fare
price.
Another example of a composite good is College Tuition and Fees (ELI EB011).
College tuition and fees are known to change on an annual basis for most institutions. However, the BLS often collects pricing data on a monthly basis for
a particular quote-line that includes financial aid. Therefore, a small change in
private loan rates can induce a small price change. For example, suppose that a
change in market interest rates a§ected financial aid and, therefore, a student’s
out-of-pocket expenses. The result would be a small change in the price recorded
by the BLS, even though the college did not change its price.
From Table 3 we see that three ELIs are subject to the point of service problem.
These ELIs account for approximately 4.1 percent of the regular and posted small
price changes. An example of such an ELI is Automobile Rental (TA041). The
BLS can obtain information on the price of car rentals from the internet. Prior to
2007, it was not always the case that the BLS recorded the precise location from
which a car was picked up. If there are small di§erences in taxes, fees, or prices at
each di§erent point of service, then changes in the point of service would generate
small changes in the prices recorded by the BLS.
From Table 3 we see that four ELIs are subject to miscellaneous forms of measurement error. These ELIs account for approximately 2.6 percent of the regular
and posted small price change observations. While these ELIs are less important
quantitatively than the other categories, they are still instructive because they
highlight the problems that can arise in measuring prices. Consider, for example, Automobile Insurance (ELI TE011). In this case, small price changes are
induced by small changes in quality that are not controlled for. According to the
BLS: “Each year in October/November, the model year of each vehicle in our
sample is updated by one year in order to keep the age of our sample vehicles
14

constant; e.g., a three year old vehicle stays three years old from year to year.
This annual updating process often results in premium changes.”14 Because car
safety has slowly improved over time, the nature of a three-year-old used car has
changed over time. Presumably, insurance premia fall to reflect this fact. Under
this circumstance the BLS would record a small price change. In our view, this
change is spurious because the good itself has changed.
The other three goods included in this category are Hospital In-patient Room
(ELI MD011) and Hospital In-patient Services, Other than Room (MD011), and
Prescription Drugs and Medical Supplies (MA011). As discussed in Cardenas
(1996), in all three cases the recorded price is the product of a complex procedure
that combines elements of composite goods, UVIs, and non-transactional prices.
A robustness check Eliminating all sources of measurement error dramatically
reduces the percentage of weighted small price changes from 12.5 to 3.6 percent
for posted prices and from 14 and 5 percent for regular prices. The analogue
reduction for unweighted small price changes is from 6.7 percent to 1.3 percent
for posted prices and from 10.5 percent to 1.9 percent for regular prices.
In one sense, the corrected estimates provide lower bounds on the actual fraction of small price changes because we eliminated all price changes less than 1
percent in the problematic ELIs that we identified. However, in another sense,
the corrected estimates overstate the true fraction of small price changes since we
only corrected for a subset of the total ELIs we think might be contaminated by
forms of measurement error.
To assess robustness of inference we re-did our computations eliminating all
problematic ELIs from the analysis, instead of eliminating only price changes
that are smaller than 1 percent in the problematic ELIs. We find that inference
14

http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpifacmvi.htm

15

is robust. For example, the fraction of price changes that is smaller than the 5
percent threshold, in absolute value, is almost identical in both cases (24.4 and
32.2 percent for posted and regular prices, respectively).
The impact of our corrections on other statistics Micro-based estimates
of the distribution of price changes are often used to calibrate competing models
of the monetary transmission mechanism. A classic example is Lucas and Golosov
(2007), who choose the size of menu costs to be consistent with the median size of
price changes, as well as other moments of the distribution of price changes. To
the extent that such moments are substantially a§ected by measurement error,
the models are misspecified, potentially leading to misleading inference.
Consider first the impact of our measurement error corrections on the median
size of weighted price changes. In the uncorrected data this statistic is roughly
2 percent for posted prices and 2.5 percent for regular prices. These statistics
are basically una§ected if we make our measurement error corrections, including
removing price changes lower than one percent in problematic ELIs. However,
if we remove all the problematic ELIs from the sample, the median size of price
change is 3 percent for posted prices and 5 percent for regular prices. The reason
this last correction has a bigger impact is that most of the small price changes are
in the problematic ELIs.
Consider next the impact of our measurement error corrections on the frequency with which prices are adjusted. Working with uncorrected data, we find,
for posted prices, that the frequency of weighted price changes is 22 percent. This
frequency rises to 25 percent when we make our measurement error corrections,
including eliminating price changes lower than one percent in problematic ELIs.
Working with the same corrections but removing all the problematic ELIs, this
frequency declines to 19 percent.

16

Next consider regular prices. Working with uncorrected data, we find that the
frequency of weighted price changes is 17 percent. This frequency declines to 16
percent when we make our measurement error corrections, including eliminating
price changes lower than one percent in problematic ELIs. Working with the same
corrections but removing all the problematic ELIs, this frequency declines to 9
percent.
We conclude that the median size of price changes and the frequency statistics are robust to our corrections with one exception. If one works with regular
prices and insists on removing all the problematic ELIs from the sample, then the
frequency of price changes drops substantially. The median size of price changes
doubles with this particular correction, and the price duration implied by the
frequency statistic rises from roughly 6 to 11 months (abstracting from Jensen’s
inequality).
The analysis in Eichenbaum, Jaimovich and Rebelo (2011) suggests that the
properties of regular prices are more relevant than those of posted prices in assessing the monetary transmission mechanism. So, we think that the results for
regular prices are particularly noteworthy. That said, we do not see any compelling reason to remove all of the problematic ELIs from our sample.

4. Conclusion
In this paper we study the frequency of small price changes. Using both scanner
data and the CPI research data set, we argue that the vast majority of small price
changes reflects measurement error. Eliminating small price changes contaminated
by measurement error reduces the number of small price changes by roughly 80
percent for both posted and regular prices in the CPI.
Small price changes may exist but they occur much less frequently than the
existing evidence suggests. Menu-cost models have been criticized because they
17

do not generate small price changes. We think that the evidence on the prevalence
of small price changes is much too weak to be used as a litmus test for assessing
these models.
We conclude by emphasizing that our results do not cast doubt on the e¢cacy
of the BLS’s methods for measuring the overall CPI or the rate of inflation. The
methods that the BLS uses were not developed to accurately isolate small price
changes. And they don’t.

5. Appendix: Description of Troublesome ELIs
In this appendix we briefly discuss the rationale for labeling an ELI problematic.
By problematic, we mean that spurious small price changes arise because of the
method used to measure prices.
5.1. UVI-based prices
•

Electricity (HF011): Prices are constructed as UVIs because it is impossible

to price exactly the same electricity service every month. The BLS collects the
total amount of energy purchases (broken down into several categories) and the
total expenditures on energy.

Using these inputs, they construct a measure of

price per unit of electricity purchase.
•

Utility natural gas services (HF021): Prices are constructed as UVIs

because it is impossible to price exactly the same utility natural gas service every
month. The BLS collects total amount of utility natural gas purchases (broken
down into several categories) and total expenditures on utility natural gas. Using
these inputs, they construct a measure of price per unit of utility natural gas
purchase.
•

Telephone services, local charges (ED011): Prices are constructed as

UVIs because it is impossible to price exactly the same local telephone services
every month. The BLS collects total amount of local telephone services purchases
(broken down into several categories) and total expenditures on local telephone
services. Using these inputs, they construct a measure of price per unit of local
telephone services. In addition, average revenue figures are often used to compute
price quotes.
•

Interstate telephone services (ED021): Prices are constructed as UVIs

because it is impossible to price exactly the same interstate telephone services
every month. The BLS collects total amount of interstate telephone services pur24

chases (broken down into several categories) and total expenditures on interstate
telephone services. Using these inputs, they construct a measure of price per unit
of interstate telephone services. In addition, average revenue figures are often used
to compute price quotes.
•

Community antenna or cable TV (RA021): Prices are constructed as

UVIs because it is impossible to price exactly the same community antenna or
cable TV services every month. The BLS collects total amount of community
antenna or cable TV purchases (broken down into several categories) and total
expenditures on community antenna or cable TV. Using these inputs, they construct a measure of price per unit of community antenna or cable TV.
•

Residential water and sewer services (HG011): Prices are constructed

as UVIs because it is impossible to price exactly the same residential water and
sewer services every month. The BLS collects total amount of residential water and sewer services purchases (broken down into several categories) and total
expenditures on residential water and sewer services. Using these inputs, they
construct a measure of price per unit of residential water and sewer services.
•

Cigarettes (GA011): The price of a specific cigarette package size is

sometime imputed from other sizes. For example, the price of a single pack of
cigarettes may be derived from the price of a five-pack carton of cigarettes. A
spurious small price change can be induced if the price of a five-pack carton is not
equal to five times the price of a single pack of cigarettes.
•

Garbage and trash collection (HG021): Prices are constructed as UVIs

because it is impossible to price exactly the same garbage and trash collection
services every month. The BLS collects total amount of garbage and trash collection purchases (broken down into several categories) and total expenditures on
garbage and trash collection. Using these inputs, they construct a measure of
price per unit of garbage and trash collection.
25

•

Men’s suits (AA011): These prices are sometimes computed as UVIs.

For example, when there is a “two-for-one” deal, the price per suit is computed
as a UVI.
5.2. Composite goods
•

Airline fares (TG011): Airline fares are a composite good made up of the

actual airline fare (e.g. non-stop United ticket from EWR to LHR), taxes and
fees, and baggage fees. The actual airline fare is generally large relative to the
other price components. So, for example, a change in an airport surcharge fee will
induce a small price change on the price of the airline fare recorded by the BLS.
•

New cars (TA011): The BLS price quote for new cars includes addi-

tional charges and/or discounts such as dealer markups, dealer concessions and
discounts, and consumer rebates. The BLS measures some of these additional
charges and discounts using a moving average over the past thirty days for the
particular vehicle quote-line. This averaging induces spurious small price changes.
•

Automotive drive train repair (TD031): As with airline fares, the price

Tires (TC011): Same issues as automotive drive train repair.

refers to a composite good that includes disposal fees and other surcharges.

tive drive train repair.
repair.
•

Personal computers and peripheral equipment (EE011): The BLS price

quote for computers includes warranties and rebates, which are collected based
on average data for a particular model over a given period of time. In addition,
attribute values (e.g. processor speed, RAM, hard drive size, etc.) can change,
26

and early quotes collected before the BLS established a concise attribute value
schematic for pricing could lack proper flagging of such changes and thus induce
small price changes.
•

College tuition and fixed fees (EB011): College tuition and fees are

known to change on an annual basis for most higher education institutions. However, the BLS collects pricing data for a particular quote-line that includes financial aid. Small change in private loan rates and averaging across students can
induce small price changes.
•

Televisions (RA011): Same issues as personal computers and peripheral

•

Automotive power plant repair (TD031): Similar issues as in Automotive

equipment.
maintenance and servicing, disposal and environmental fees can induce small price
changes.
5.3. Point of service
•

Lodging while out of town (HB021): The point of service information can

be inaccurate and induce small price changes. There are also non-taxed charges,
fees, and surcharges that can a§ect the price quote outside of the actual pricing
done by the producer of lodging.
•

Automobile rental (TA041): The BLS price quote for automobile rentals

includes additional charges, which may include average revenue figures in the
computation. In addition, changes in the point of service information for rental
cars (particularly given the increase in internet and/or telephone rentals) can
induce spurious small price changes.
•

Ship fares (TG023): Same issue as automobile rental.

27

5.4. Miscellaneous
•

Prescription drugs and medical supplies (MA011): When calculating price

quotes, the BLS collects data on insurance reimbursement for the particular medication. The providers of this data may report figures that are based on averages
across patients or on preliminary estimates for insurance reimbursement. In addition, unmeasured changes in medication dosage can induce spurious small price
changes.
•

Hospital room in-patient (MD011): A variety of factors impact the BLS

price quote of the hospital in-patient room. In particular, the chargemaster, or the
master list of prices served (for health insurance purposes), is the main factor in
determining the price of the hospital in-patient room. It is well documented that
prices in this chargemaster, which changes periodically, do not actually capture
the price paid by a patient admitted for a particular service.
•

Automobile insurance (TE011): The BLS carefully tracks particular indi-

vidual policies over a given time period. However, it annually adjusts the sampling
vehicle. The measured price can change simply because the new sampling vehicle
is safer than the previous sampling vehicle. This situation can result is a small
price change even though the actual price of insurance per unit of car safety has
not changed. In addition, issuance of dividends to policyholders a§ects how prices
are measured. Depending on how dividends are issued, the BLS either considers
them to be a price reduction or not.
•

Hospital in-patient services, other than room (MD011): Same issues as

hospital room in-patient.
