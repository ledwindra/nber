    "abstract": "\n\nThe Rational Distributed Lag Structural Form of an econometric model is introduced, and its relationship to several traditional forms of representation is discussed.  The traditional forms are viewed as special cases of the Rational Structural Form.  Thus, the latter provides a unified framework for any treatment of the linear, time invariant modeling problem.  In particular, a solution of the estimation problem for the Rational Structural Form leads to the solution of the estimation problem for all traditional forms.\n\n",
