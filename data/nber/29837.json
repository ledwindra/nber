    "abstract": "\n\nU.S. stock volatility is 25 percent lower during wartime and periods of conflict, including World War II. Schwert (1989) identified the \u201cwar puzzle\u201d as a surprising fact from two centuries of realized stock volatility data. We hypothesize that stable demand from defense spending makes corporate America\u2019s cash flows easier to forecast during wartime. Using new hand-collected data on 100 years of military spending, we document that defense outlays reduce aggregate, sector- and state-level stock volatility. Firm-level event studies of recent U.S. military conflicts demonstrate that equity analysts\u2019 earnings forecasts of procurement-intensive companies became significantly less dispersed in the aftermath of 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq.\n\n",
