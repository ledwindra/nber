    "abstract": "\n\nWe use penalized withdrawals from retirement savings accounts as a revealed-preference tool to document three findings on American households' valuation of liquidity. First, local supply of credit explains over 30 percent of the nationwide differences in the valuation of liquidity across labor markets. Second, locations severely affected by the Great Recession displayed large increases in the valuation of liquidity, with spillovers in local credit tightening accounting for three-thirds of the effect. Third, Black households rely more on self-insurance from penalized withdrawals, consistent with lower access to formal credit markets. Overall, our findings imply sizable welfare gains from richer policy targeting.\n\n",
