The theory formulates an expectations induced relationship between the exchange rate and the fundamental subject to random shocks and target zone constraints on rates of depreciation. The empirical analysis identifies the roles played by policy and market fundamentals in foreign exchange markets, and estimate the key parameters of the exchange rate dynamic equation.\n\n",
