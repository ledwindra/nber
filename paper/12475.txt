Capital Deepening and Non-Balanced Economic Growth

ABSTRACT
This paper constructs a model of non-balanced economic growth. The main economic force is the
combination of differences in factor proportions and capital deepening. Capital deepening tends to
increase the relative output of the sector with a greater capital share, but simultaneously induces a
reallocation of capital and labor away from that sector. We first illustrate this force using a general
two-sector model. We then investigate it further using a class of models with constant elasticity of
substitution between two sectors and Cobb-Douglas production functions in each sector. In this class
of models, non-balanced growth is shown to be consistent with an asymptotic equilibrium with
constant interest rate and capital share in national income. We also show that for realistic parameter
values, the model generates dynamics that are broadly consistent with US data. In particular, the
model generates more rapid growth of employment in less capital-intensive sectors, more rapid
growth of real output in more capital-intensive sectors and aggregate behavior in line with the Kaldor
facts. Finally, we construct and analyze a model of “non-balanced endogenous growth,” which
extends the main results of the paper to an economy with endogenous anddirected technical change.
This model shows that equilibrium will typically involve endogenous non-balanced technological
progress.

Introduction

Most models of economic growth strive to be consistent with the “Kaldor facts”, i.e., the
relative constancy of the growth rate, the capital-output ratio, the share of capital income
in GDP and the real interest rate (see Kaldor, 1963, and also Denison, 1974, Homer and
Sylla, 1991, Barro and Sala-i-Martin, 2004). Beneath this balanced picture, however, are the
patterns that Kongsamut, Rebelo and Xie (2001) refer to as the “Kuznets facts”, which concern
the systematic change in the relative importance of various sectors, in particular, agriculture,
manufacturing and services (see Kuznets, 1957, 1973, Chenery, 1960, Kongsamut, Rebelo and
Xie, 2001). While the Kaldor facts emphasize the balanced nature of economic growth, the
Kuznets facts highlight its non-balanced nature. Figure 1 illustrates some aspects of both the
Kaldor and Kuznets facts for postwar US; the capital share of national income is relatively
constant, whereas relative employment and output in services increase significantly.1
The Kuznets facts have motivated a small literature, which typically starts by positing
non-homothetic preferences consistent with Engel’s law.2 This literature therefore emphasizes
the demand-side reasons for non-balanced growth; the marginal rate of substitution between
diﬀerent goods changes as an economy grows, directly leading to a pattern of uneven growth
between sectors. An alternative thesis, first proposed by Baumol (1967), emphasizes the potential non-balanced nature of economic growth resulting from diﬀerential productivity growth
across sectors, but has received less attention in the literature.3
This paper has two aims. First, it shows that there is a natural supply-side reason, related to Baumol’s (1967) thesis, for economic growth to be non-balanced. Diﬀerences in factor
proportions across sectors (i.e., diﬀerent shares of capital) combined with capital deepening

the interesting papers by Stokey (1988), Matsuyama (2002), Foellmi and Zweimuller (2002), and Buera and
Kaboski (2006), which derive non-homothetiticites from the presence of a “hierarchy of needs” or “hierarchy
of qualities”. Finally, Hall and Jones (2006) point out that there are natural reasons for health care to be
a superior good (because expected life expectancy multiplies utility) and show how this can account for the
increase in health care spending. Matsuyama (2005) presents an excellent overview of this literature.

Two exceptions are the two recent independent papers by Ngai and Pissarides (2006) and Zuleta and Young
(2006). Ngai and Pissarides (2006), for example, construct a model of multi-sector economic growth inspired
by Baumol. In Ngai and Pissarides’s model, there are exogenous Total Factor Productivity diﬀerences across
sectors, but all sectors have identical Cobb-Douglas production functions. While both of these papers are
potentially consistent with the Kuznets and Kaldor facts, they do not contain the main contribution of our
paper: non-balanced growth resulting from factor proportion diﬀerences and capital deepening.

will lead to non-balanced growth. The reason is simple: an increase in capital-labor ratio will
raise output more in the sector with greater capital intensity. More specifically, we prove that
“balanced technological progress”,4 capital deepening and diﬀerences in factor proportions always cause non-balanced growth. This result holds irrespective of the exact source of economic
growth or the process of accumulation.
The second objective of the paper is to present and analyze a tractable two-sector growth
model featuring non-balanced growth and investigate under what circumstances non-balanced
growth can be consistent with aggregate Kaldor facts. We do this by constructing a class of
economies with constant elasticity of substitution between two sectors and Cobb-Douglas production functions within each sector. We characterize the equilibria in this class of economies
with both exogenous and endogenous technological change. We show that the limiting (asymp4

sectors. Hicks-neutral technological progress is both a natural benchmark and also the type of technological
progress that the more microfounded models considered in Sections 3 and 5 will generate.

totic) equilibrium takes a simple form and features constant but diﬀerent growth rates in each
sector, constant interest rate and constant share of capital in national income.
Other properties of the limiting equilibrium of this class of economies depend on whether
the products of the two sectors are gross substitutes or complements (meaning whether the
elasticity of substitution between these products is greater than or less than one). Suppose for
this discussion that the rates of technological progress in the two sectors are similar. In this
case, when the two sectors are gross substitutes, the more capital-intensive sector dominates
the economy. The form of the equilibrium is more subtle and interesting when the elasticity of
substitution between these products is less than one; the growth rate of the economy is now
determined by the more slowly growing, less capital-intensive sector. Despite the change in
the terms of trade against the faster growing, capital-intensive sector, in equilibrium suﬃcient
amounts of capital and labor are deployed in this sector to ensure a faster rate of growth than
in the less capital-intensive sector.
One interesting feature is that our model economy generates non-balanced growth without
significantly deviating from the Kaldor facts. In particular, even in the limiting equilibrium
both sectors grow at positive (and unequal) rates. More importantly, when the elasticity of
substitution is less than one,5 convergence to this limiting equilibrium is typically slow and
along the transition path, growth is non-balanced, while capital share and interest rate vary
by relatively small amounts. Therefore, the equilibrium with an elasticity of substitution less
than one may be able to rationalize both non-balanced sectoral growth and the Kaldor facts.
Finally, we present and analyze a model of “non-balanced endogenous growth,” which shows
the robustness of our results to endogenous technological progress. Our analysis shows that
when sectors diﬀer in terms of their capital intensity, equilibrium technological change will
5

As we will see below, the elasticity of substitution between products will be less than one if and only if the
(short-run) elasticity of substitution between labor and capital is less than one. In view of the time-series and
cross-industry evidence, a short-run elasticity of substitution between labor and capital less than one appears
reasonable.
For example, Hamermesh (1993), Nadiri (1970) and Nerlove (1967) survey a range of early estimates of the
elasticity of substitution, which are generally between 0.3 and 0.7. David and Van de Klundert (1965) similarly
estimate this elasticity to be in the neighborhood of 0.3. Using the translog production function, Griﬃn and
Gregory (1976) estimate elasticities of substitution for nine OECD economies between 0.06 and 0.52. Berndt
(1976), on the other hand, estimates an elasticity of substitution equal to 1, but does not control for a time
trend, creating a strong bias towards 1. Using more recent data, and various diﬀerent specifications, Krusell,
Ohanian, Rios-Rull, and Violante (2000) and Antras (2001) also find estimates of the elasticity significantly
less than 1. Estimates implied by the response of investment to the user cost of capital also typically imply an
elasticity of substitution between capital and labor significantly less than 1 (see, e.g., Chirinko, 1993, Chirinko,
Fazzari and Mayer, 1999, or Mairesse, Hall and Mulkay, 1999).

itself be non-balanced and will not restore balanced growth between sectors. To the best of
our knowledge, despite the large literature on endogenous growth, there are no previous studies
that combine endogenous technological progress and non-balanced growth.6
A variety of evidence suggests that non-homotheticities in consumption emphasized by the
previous literature are indeed present and create a tendency towards non-balanced growth. Our
purpose in this paper is not to argue that these demand-side factors are unimportant, but to
propose and isolate an alternative supply-side force contributing to non-balanced growth and
show that it is potentially quite powerful as well. Naturally, whether or not our mechanism is
important in practice is an empirical question. In Section 4, we undertake a simple calibration
of our benchmark model to provide a preliminary investigation of this question. As a preparation for this calibration, Figure 2 shows the equivalent of Figure 1, but with sectors divided
according to their capital intensity (see Appendix B for details). This figure shows a number
of important patterns: first, consistent with our qualitative predictions, there is more rapid
growth of employment in less capital-intensive sectors.7 Second, also in line with our approach,
the figure shows that the rate of growth of real GDP is faster in more capital-intensive sectors.
Notably, this contrasts with Figure 1, which showed faster growth in both employment and
real GDP for services. The opposite movements of employment and real GDP for sectors with
high and low capital intensity is a distinctive feature of our approach (for the theoretically and
empirically relevant case of the elasticity of substitution less than one). The simple calibration exercise in Section 4 also shows that our model economy generates equilibrium dynamics
consistent with both non-balanced growth at the sectoral level and the Kaldor facts at the
aggregate level. Moreover, not only the qualitative but also the quantitative implications of
our model appear to be broadly consistent with the data shown in Figure 2.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 shows how the combination of
factor proportions diﬀerences and capital deepening lead to non-balanced growth. Section 3
constructs a more specific model with a constant elasticity of substitution between two sectors,

(1993). Aghion and Howitt (1998) and Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2004) provide excellent introductions to
endogenous growth theory. See also Acemoglu (2002) on models of directed technical change that feature
endogenous, but balanced technological progress in diﬀerent sectors. Acemoglu (2003) presents a model with
non-balanced technological progress between two sectors, but in the limiting equilibrium both sectors grow at
the same rate.

Note also that the magnitude of changes in Figure 2 is less than those in Figure 1, which suggests that
changes in the composition of demand between manufacturing and services are likely responsible for some of
the changes in the sectoral composition of output experienced over the past 60 years.

full dynamic equilibrium of this economy and shows how the model generates non-balanced
sectoral growth, while remaining consistent with the Kaldor facts. Section 4 undertakes a
simple calibration of our benchmark economy to investigate whether the dynamics generated
by the model are consistent with the changes in the relative output and employment of capitalintensive sectors and the Kaldor facts. Section 5 introduces endogenous technological change
and shows that our general results continue to hold in the presence of endogenous technological
progress across sectors. Section 6 concludes. Appendix A contains proofs that are not presented
in the text, while Appendix B gives some details about NIPA data and sectoral classifications
used in Figures 1 and 2 and in Section 4.

Capital Deepening and Non-Balanced Growth

We first illustrate how diﬀerences in factor proportions across sectors combined with capital
deepening lead to non-balanced economic growth. To do this, we use a standard two-sector
competitive model with constant returns to scale in both sectors, and two factors of production,
capital, K, and labor, L. To highlight that the exact nature of the accumulation process is
not essential for the results, in this section we take the sequence (process) of capital and labor
supplies, [K (t) , L (t)]∞
t=0 , as given and assume that labor is supplied inelastically. In addition,
we omit explicit time dependence when this will cause no confusion.
Final output, Y , is produced as an aggregate of the output of two sectors, Y1 and Y2 ,
Y = F (Y1 , Y2 ) ,
and we assume that F exhibits constant returns to scale and is twice continuously diﬀerentiable.
Output in both sectors is produced with the production functions
Y1 = A1 G1 (K1 , L1 )

(1)

Y2 = A2 G2 (K2 , L2 ) .

(2)

and

The functions G1 and G2 also exhibit constant returns to scale and are twice continuously
diﬀerentiable. A1 and A2 denote Hicks-neutral technology terms. Hicks-neutral technological
progress is convenient to work with and is also relevant since it is the type of technological progress that the models in Sections 3 and 5 will generate. We also assume that F ,
G1 and G2 satisfy the Inada conditions; limKj →0 ∂Gj (Kj , Lj ) /∂Kj = ∞ for all Lj > 0,
limLj →0 ∂Gj (Kj , Lj ) /∂Lj = ∞ for all Kj > 0, limKj →∞ ∂Gj (Kj , Lj ) /∂Kj = 0 for all
Lj < ∞, limLj →∞ ∂Gj (Kj , Lj ) /∂Lj = 0 for all Kj < ∞, and limYj →0 ∂F (Y1 , Y2 ) /∂Yj = ∞
for all Y∼j > 0, where j = 1, 2 and ∼ j stands for “not j”. These assumptions ensure interior
solutions and simplify the exposition, though they are not necessary for the results presented
in this section.
Market clearing implies
K1 + K2 = K,
L1 + L2 = L,
6

where K and L are the (potentially time-varying) supplies of capital and labor, given by the
exogenous sequences [K (t) , L (t)]∞
t=0 . We take these sequences to be continuosly diﬀerentiable
functions of time. Without loss of any generality, we also ignore capital depreciation.
We normalize the price of the final good to 1 in every period and denote the prices of Y1
and Y2 by p1 and p2 , and wage and rental rate of capital (interest rate) by w and r. We assume
that product and factor markets are competitive, so product prices satisfy

iii Technological progress is balanced at time t if Ȧ1 (t) /A1 (t) = Ȧ2 (t) /A2 (t) .
In this definition, σ 1 (t) 6= σ 2 (t) refers to the equilibrium factor proportions in the two
sectors at time t. It does not necessarily mean that these will not be equal at some future
date.
The next theorem shows that if there is capital deepening and factor proportion diﬀerences,
then balanced technological progress is not consistent with balanced growth.
8

Without the Inada conditions, these would have to be written as
w ≥ ∂A1 G1 (K1 , L1 ) /∂L1 and L1 ≥ 0,

with complementary slackness, etc.

Theorem 1 Suppose that at time t, there are factor proportion diﬀerences between the two
sectors, technological progress is balanced, and there is capital deepening, then growth is not
balanced, that is, Ẏ1 (t) /Y1 (t) 6= Ẏ2 (t) /Y2 (t).
Proof. First define the capital to labor ratio in the two sectors as
k1 ≡

K1
K2
and k2 ≡
,
L1
L2

and the “per capita production functions” (without the Hicks-neutral technology term) as

G2 (K2 , L2 )
and g2 (k2 ) ≡
.
L1
L2

Since G1 and G2 are twice continuously diﬀerentiable, so are g1 and g2 .

Suppose, to obtain a contradiction, that Ẏ1 /Y1 = Ẏ2 /Y2 . Since Ȧ1 /A1 = Ȧ2 /A2 and σ 1 6= σ 2 ,
this implies k̇1 /k1 6= k̇2 /k2 . [Otherwise, k̇1 /k1 = k̇2 /k2 > 0, and capital deepening implies
Ẏ1 /Y1 6= Ẏ2 /Y2 ; for example, if σ 1 < σ 2 , then Ẏ1 /Y1 < Ẏ2 /Y2 ].
Since F exhibits constant returns to scale, (4) implies

Since Ȧ1 /A1 = Ȧ2 /A2 and σ 1 6= σ 2 , this equation is inconsistent with (11), yielding a contradiction and proving the claim.
The intuition for this result can be obtained as follows. Suppose that there is capital
deepening and that, for concreteness, sector 2 is more capital-intensive (i.e., σ 1 < σ 2 ). Now,
if both capital and labor are allocated to the two sectors with constant proportions, the more
capital-intensive sector, sector 2, will grow faster than sector 1. In equilibrium, the faster
growth in sector 2 will naturally change equilibrium prices, and the decline in the relative price
of sector 2 will cause some of the labor and capital to be reallocated to sector 1. However, this
reallocation cannot entirely oﬀset the greater increase in the output of sector 2, since, if it did,
the relative price change that stimulated the reallocation would not take place. Consequently,
equilibrium growth must be non-balanced.
The proof of Theorem 1 also makes it clear that balanced technological progress is not
necessary for the result, but simply suﬃcient. This point is further discussed following Theorem
3 in the next section.
It is useful to relate Theorem 1 to Rybczynski’s Theorem in international trade (Rybczynski, 1950). Rybczynski’s Theorem states that for an open economy within the “cone of diversification” (where factor prices do not depend on factor endowments), changes in factor
endowments will be absorbed by changes in sectoral output mix. Our result can be viewed
as a closed-economy analogue of Rybczynski’s Theorem; it shows that changes in factor endowments (capital deepening) will be absorbed by faster growth in one sector than the other,
9

even though relative prices of goods and factors will change in response to the change in factor
endowments.9
Finally, the proof of Theorem 1 makes it clear that the two-sector structure is not necessary
for this result. In light of this, we also state a generalization for N ≥ 2 sectors, where aggregate
output is given by the constant returns to scale production function
Y = F (Y1 , Y2 , ..., YN ) .
Defining σ j as the capital share in sector j = 1, ..., N as in (6), we have:
Theorem 2 Suppose that at time t, there are factor proportion diﬀerences among the N
sectors in the sense that there exists i and j ≤ N such that σ i (t) 6= σ j (t), technological progress
is balanced between i and j, i.e., Ȧi (t) /Ai (t) = Ȧj (t) /Aj (t), and there is capital deepening,
i.e., K̇ (t) /K (t) > L̇ (t) /L (t), then growth is not balanced and Ẏi (t) /Yi (t) 6= Ẏj (t) /Yj (t).
The proof of this theorem parallels that of Theorem 1 and is omitted.

Two-Sector Growth with Exogenous Technology

The previous section demonstrated that diﬀerences in factor proportions across sectors and
capital deepening will lead to non-balanced growth. This result was proved for a given (arbitrary) sequence of capital and labor supplies, [K (t) , L (t)]∞
t=0 , but this level of generality
does not allow us to fully characterize the equilibrium path and its limiting properties. We
now wish to analyze the equilibrium behavior of such an economy fully, which requires us to
endogenize the sequence of capital stocks (so that capital deepening emerges as an equilibrium
phenomenon). We will accomplish this by imposing more structure both on the production
technology and on preferences. Capital deepening will result from exogenous technological
progress, which will in turn be endogenized in Section 5.
9

Note also that even if the result in Theorem 1 holds asymptotically (as t → ∞), it does not contradict
the celebrated “Turnpike theorems” in the optimal growth literature (e.g., Radner, 1961, Scheinkman, 1976,
Bewley, 1982, McKenzie, 1998, Jensen, 2002). These theorems show that starting from diﬀerent initial points,
the economy will tend to the same asymptotic trajectory. The fact that growth is non-balanced does not preclude
this possibility.

3.1

Demographics, Preferences and Technology

The economy consists of L (t) workers at time t, supplying their labor inelastically. There is
exponential population growth,
L (t) = exp (nt) L (0) .

(12)

We assume that all households have constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) preferences over
total household consumption (rather than per capita consumption), and all population growth
takes place within existing households (thus there is no growth in the number of households).10
This implies that the economy admits a representative agent with CRRA preferences:
Z ∞
C(t)1−θ − 1 −ρt
e dt,
1−θ
0

(13)

where C (t) is aggregate consumption at time t, ρ is the rate of time preferences and θ ≥ 0
is the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution (or the coeﬃcient of relative risk
aversion). We again drop time arguments to simplify the notation whenever this causes no
confusion. We also continue to assume that there is no depreciation of capital.
The flow budget constraint for the representative consumer is:
K̇ = rK + wL + Π − C.

(14)

Here w is the equilibrium wage rate and r is the equilibrium interest rate, K and L denote
the total capital stock and the total labor force in the economy, and Π is total net corporate
profits received by the consumers (which will be equal to zero in this section).
The unique final good is produced by combining the output of two sectors with an elasticity
of substitution ε ∈ [0, ∞):

(15)

where γ is a distribution parameter which determines the relative importance of the two goods
in the aggregate production.
The resource constraint of the economy, in turn, requires consumption and investment to
be less than total output, Y = rK + wL + Π, thus
K̇ + C ≤ Y.

(16)

The alternative would be to specify population growth taking place at the extensive margin, in which case
the discount rate of the representative agent would be ρ − n rather than ρ, without any important changes in
the analysis.

where y1 (i)’s and y2 (i)’s denote the intermediates in the sectors that have diﬀerent capital/labor ratios, and M1 and M2 represent the technology terms. In particular M1 denotes
the number of intermediates in sector 1 and M2 the number of intermediate goods in sector
2. This structure is particularly useful since it can also be used for the analysis of endogenous
growth in Section 5.
Intermediate goods are produced with the following Cobb-Douglas technologies
y1 (i) = l1 (i)α1 k1 (i)1−α1 and y2 (i) = l2 (i)α2 k2 (i)1−α2 ,

(18)

where l1 (i) and k1 (i) are labor and capital used in the production of good i of sector 1 and
l2 (i) and k2 (i) are labor and capital used in the production of good i of sector 2.11
The parameters α1 and α2 determine which sector is more “capital intensive”.12 When
α1 > α2 , sector 1 is less capital intensive, while the converse applies when α1 < α2 . In the rest
of the analysis, we assume that
α1 > α2 ,

(A1)

which only rules out the case where α1 = α2 , since the two sectors are otherwise identical
and the labeling of the sector with the lower capital share as sector 1 is without loss of any
generality.

Strictly speaking, we should have two indices, i1 ∈ M1 and i2 ∈ M2 , where Mj is the set of intermediates
of type j, and Mj is the measure of the set Mj . We simplify the notation by using a generic i to denote both
indices, and let the context determine which index is being referred to.
12
We use the term “capital intensive” as corresponding to a greater share of capital in value added, i.e.,
σ2 > σ1 in terms of the notation of the previous section. While this share is constant because of the CobbDouglas technologies, the equilibrium ratios of capital to labor in the two sectors depend on prices.

where the first set of equalities in these equations define K1 , L1 , K2 and L2 as the levels of
capital and labor used in the two sectors, and the second set of equalities impose market
clearing.

Since M1 and M2 determine productivity in their respective sectors, we will refer to them as
“technology”. In this section, we assume that all intermediates are also produced competitively
(i.e., any firm can produce any of the existing intermediates). In Section 5, we will modify
this assumption and assume that new intermediates are invented by R&D and the firm that
invents a new intermediate has a fully-enforced perpetual patent for its production.

Equilibrium

Recall that w and r denote the wage and the capital rental rate, and p1 and p2 denote the
1
prices of the Y1 and Y2 goods, with the price of the final good normalized to one. Let [q1 (i)]M
i=1
2
and [q2 (i)]M
i=1 be the prices for labor-intensive and capital-intensive intermediates.

[k1 (i)]M
i=1 , [k2 (i)]i=1 such that firms maximize profits and markets clear, and consumption and

savings decisions, C and K̇, maximize consumer utility.
It is useful to break the characterization of equilibrium into two pieces: static and dynamic.
The static part takes the state variables of the economy, which are the capital stock, the labor
supply and the technology, K, L, M1 and M2 , as given and determines the allocation of capital
and labor across sectors and factor and good prices. The dynamic part of the equilibrium
determines the evolution of the endogenous state variable, K (the dynamic behavior of L is
given by (12) and those of M1 and M2 by (21)).
Our choice of numeraire implies that the price of the final good, P , satisfies:

Next, since Y1 and Y2 are supplied competitively, their prices are equal to the value of their
marginal product, thus

(23)

Since all intermediates are produced competitively, prices must equal marginal cost. Moreover, given the production functions in (18), the marginal costs of producing intermediates
take the familiar Cobb-Douglas form,
1
2
mc1 (i) = α−α
(1 − α1 )α1 −1 r1−α1 wα1 and mc2 (i) = α−α
(1 − α2 )α2 −1 r1−α2 wα2 .
1
2

Therefore, at all points in time, intermediate prices satisfy
q1 (i) = α1 (1 − α1 )α1 −1 r1−α1 wα1 ,

(24)

q2 (i) = α2 (1 − α2 )α2 −1 r1−α2 wα2 ,

(25)

and

for all i.
Equations (24) and (25) imply that all intermediates in each sector sell at the same price
q1 = q1 (i) for all i ≤ M1 and q2 = q2 (i) for all i ≤ M2 . This combined with (23) implies that
the demand for, and the production of, the same type of intermediate will be the same. Thus:
y1 (i) = l1 (i)α1 k1 (i)1−α1
= l1α1 k11−α1 = y1

∀i ≤ M1

y2 (i) = l2 (i)α2 k2 (i)1−α2
= l2α2 k21−α2 = y2

∀i ≤ M2 ,

where l1 and k1 are the levels of employment and capital used in each intermediate of sector
1, and l2 and k2 are the levels of employment and capital used for intermediates in sector 2.
Market clearing conditions, (19) and (20), then imply that l1 = L1 /M1 , k1 = K1 /M1 ,
l2 = L2 /M2 and k2 = K2 /M2 , so we have the output of each intermediate in the two sectors as
y1 =

Lα1 1 K11−α1
M1

and
14

y2 =

Lα2 2 K21−α2
.
M2

(26)

Substituting (26) into (17), we obtain the total supply of labor- and capital-intensive goods
as
1

1

Y1 = M1ν−1 Lα1 1 K11−α1 and Y2 = M2ν−1 Lα2 2 K21−α2 .

(27)

Comparing these (derived) production functions to (1) and (2) highlights that in this economy,
the production functions G1 and G2 from the previous section take Cobb-Douglas forms,
with one sector always having a higher share of capital than the other sector, and also that
1

1

A1 ≡ M1ν−1 and A2 ≡ M2ν−1 .
In addition, combining (27) with (15) implies that the aggregate output of the economy is:

3.3

Static Equilibrium: Comparative Statics

Let us now analyze how changes in the state variables, L, K, M1 and M2 , impact on equilibrium
factor prices and factor shares. As noted in the Introduction, the case with ε < 1 is of greater
interest (and empirically more relevant as pointed out in footnote 5), so, throughout, we focus
on this case (though we give the result for the case in which ε > 1, and we only omit the
standard case with ε = 1 to avoid repetition).
13

To obtain these equations, start with the cost functions above,

Shepherd’s Lemma. For example, for the sector 1, these are l1 = 1−α1 w
y1 and k1 = 1−α1 w
y1 .
Combine these two equations to derive the equilibrium relationship between r and w. Then using equation (24),
eliminate r to obtain a relationship between w and q1 . Finally, combining this relationship with the demand
curve in (23), the market clearing conditions, (19) and (20), and using (27) yields (29). The other equations are
obtained similarly.

15

Let us denote the fraction of capital and labor employed in the labor-intensive sector by
κ ≡ K1 /K and λ ≡ L1 /L (clearly 1 − κ ≡ K2 /K and 1 − λ ≡ L2 /L). Combining equations
(29), (30), (31) and (32), we obtain:

Equation (34) makes it clear that the share of labor in sector 1, λ, is monotonically increasing
in the share of capital in sector 1, κ. We next determine how these two shares change with
capital accumulation and technological change.
Proposition 1 In equilibrium,

(36)

The proof of this proposition is straightforward and is omitted.
Equation (35), part 1 of the proposition, states that when the elasticity of substitution between sectors, ε, is less than 1, the fraction of capital allocated to the capital-intensive sector
declines in the stock of capital (and conversely, when ε > 1, this fraction is increasing in the
stock of capital). To obtain the intuition for this comparative static, which is useful for understanding many of the results that will follow, note that if K increases and κ remains constant,
then the capital-intensive sector, sector 2, will grow by more than sector 1. Equilibrium prices
given in (22) then imply that when ε < 1 the relative price of the capital-intensive sector will
fall more than proportionately, inducing a greater fraction of capital to be allocated to the less
capital-intensive sector 1. The intuition for the converse result when ε > 1 is straightforward.
Moreover, equation (36) implies that when the elasticity of substitution, ε, is less than one,
an improvement in the technology of a sector causes the share of capital going to that sector
to fall. The intuition is again the same: when ε < 1, increased production in a sector causes
16

a more than proportional decline in its relative price, inducing a reallocation of capital away
from it towards the other sector (again the converse results and intuition apply when ε > 1).
Proposition 1 gives only the comparative statics for κ. Equation (34) immediately implies
that the same comparative statics apply to λ and thus yields the following corollary:

Note that σK refers to the share of capital in national income, and is thus diﬀerent from the capital shares
in the previous section, which were sector specific. Sector-specific capital shares are constant here because of
the Cobb-Douglas production functions (in particular, σ 1 = α1 and σ2 = α2 ).

17

Proof. Parts 1 and 2 follow from diﬀerentiating equation (37) and Proposition 1. Here
we prove parts 3 and 4. First, combine the production function and the equilibrium capital

Equations (41) and (42) then imply (39) and (40).
The most important result in this proposition is part 3, which links the equilibrium relationship between the capital share in national income and the capital stock to the elasticity of
substitution. Since a negative relationship between the share of capital in national income and
the capital stock is equivalent to capital and labor being gross complements in the aggregate,
this result also implies that, as claimed in footnote 5, the elasticity of substitution between
capital and labor is less than one if and only if ε is less than one. Intuitively, as in Theorem 1,
an increase in the capital stock of the economy causes the output of the more capital-intensive
sector, sector 2, to increase relative to the output in the less capital-intensive sector (despite
the fact that the share of capital allocated to the less-capital intensive sector increases as shown
in equation (35)). This then increases the production of the more capital-intensive sector, and,
when ε < 1, it reduces the relative reward to capital (and the share of capital in national
income). The converse result applies when ε > 1.
Moreover, when ε < 1, part 4 implies that an increase in M1 is “capital biased” and an
increase in M2 is “labor biased”. The intuition for why an increase in the productivity of the
18

sector that is intensive in capital is biased toward labor (and vice versa) is once again similar:
when the elasticity of substitution between the two sectors, ε, is less than one, an increase in
the output of a sector (this time driven by a change in technology) decreases its price more than
proportionately, thus reducing the relative compensation of the factor used more intensively in
that sector (see Acemoglu, 2002). When ε > 1, we have the converse pattern, and an increase
in M2 is “capital biased,” while an increase in M1 is “labor biased”

3.4

Dynamic Equilibrium

We now turn to the characterization of the dynamic equilibrium path of this economy. We
start with the Euler equation for consumers, which follows from the maximization of (13). The
Euler equation takes the familiar form:
1
Ċ
= (r − ρ).
C
θ

(43)

Since the only asset of the representative household in this economy is capital, the transversality
condition takes the standard form:
µ Z t
¶
lim K (t) exp −
r (τ ) dτ = 0,

t→∞

(44)

0

which, together with the Euler equation (43) and the resource constraint (16), determines the
dynamic behavior of consumption and capital stock, C and K. Equations (12) and (21) give
the behavior of L, M1 and M2 .
We can therefore define a dynamic equilibrium as follows:
Definition 4 A dynamic equilibrium is given by paths of wages, interest rates, labor and
capital allocation decisions, w, r, λ and κ, satisfying (29), (30), (31), (32), (33) and (34), and
of consumption, C, capital stock, K, employment, L, and technology, M1 and M2 , satisfying
(12), (16), (21), (43), and (44).
Let us also introduce the following notation for growth rates of the key objects in this
economy:
L̇1

L̇

so that ns and zs denote the growth rate of labor and capital stock, ms denotes the growth
rate of technology, and gs denotes the growth rate of output in sector s. Moreover, whenever
they exist, we denote the corresponding asymptotic growth rates by asterisks, i.e.,
n∗s = lim ns , zs∗ = lim zs and gs∗ = lim gs .
t→∞

t→∞

t→∞

Similarly denote the asymptotic capital and labor allocation decisions by asterisks
κ∗ = lim κ and λ∗ = lim λ.

t→∞

We now state and prove two lemmas that will be useful both in this section and again in
Section 5.
Lemma 1 If ε < 1, then n1 R n2 ⇔ z1 R z2 ⇔ g1 Q g2 . If ε > 1, then n1 R n2 ⇔ z1 R z2 ⇔
g1 R g2 .

Subtracting the second expression from the first gives n1 − n2 = (ε − 1) (g1 − g2 ) /ε, and

yields

(46)

Subtracting the second expression from the first again gives the second part of the result.

This lemma establishes the straightforward, but at first counter-intuitive, result that, when
the elasticity of substitution between the two sectors is less than one, the equilibrium growth
rate of the capital stock and labor force in the sector that is growing faster must be less than
in the other sector. When the elasticity of substitution is greater than one, the converse result
obtains. To see the intuition, note that terms of trade (relative prices) shift in favor of the
more slowly growing sector. When the elasticity of substitution is less than one, this change
in relative prices is more than proportional with the change in quantities and this encourages
more of the factors to be allocated towards the more slowly growing sector.
20

Lemma 2 Suppose the asymptotic growth rates g1∗ and g2∗ exist.

If ε < 1, then g ∗ =

min {g1∗ , g2∗ }. If ε > 1, then g ∗ = max {g1∗ , g2∗ } .
Proof. Diﬀerentiating the production function for the final good (28) we obtain:

(47)

This equation, combined with ε < 1, implies that as t → ∞, g ∗ = min {g1∗ , g2∗ }. Similarly,
combined with ε > 1, it implies that as t → ∞, g ∗ = max {g1∗ , g2∗ }.

Consequently, when the elasticity of substitution is less than 1, the asymptotic growth rate
of aggregate output will be determined by the sector that is growing more slowly, and the
converse applies when ε > 1.

3.5

Constant Growth Paths

We first focus on asymptotic equilibrium paths, which are equilibrium paths that the economy
tends to as t → ∞. A constant growth path (CGP) is defined as an equilibrium path where
the asymptotic growth rate of consumption exists and is constant, i.e.,
Ċ
∗
= gC
.
t→∞ C
lim

From the Euler equation (43), this also implies that the interest rate must be asymptotically
constant, i.e., limt→∞ ṙ = 0.
To establish the existence of a CGP, we impose the following parameter restriction:
½
¾
m1 m2
1−θ
max
,
+ (1 − θ) n.
(A2)
ρ≥
ν −1
α1 α2
This assumption ensures that the transversality condition (44) holds.15 Terms of the form
m1 /α1 or m2 /α2 appear naturally in equilibrium, since they capture the “augmented” rate
of technological progress. In particular, recall that associated with the technological progress,
there will also be equilibrium capital deepening in each sector. The overall eﬀect on labor
productivity (and output growth) will depend on the rate of technological progress augmented
15

If instead we took the discount rate of the representative household to be ρ − n as noted in footnote 10,
then n in (A2) would not be multiplied by (1 − θ).

21

with the rate of capital deepening. The terms m1 /α1 or m2 /α2 capture this, since a lower α1
or α2 corresponds to a greater share of capital in the relevant sector, and thus a higher rate of
augmented technological progress for a given rate of Hicks-neutral technological change. In this
light, Assumption A2 can be understood as implying that the augmented rate of technological
progress should be low enough to satisfy the transversality condition (44).
The next theorem is the main result of this part of the paper and characterizes the relatively
simple form of the CGP in the presence of non-balanced growth. Although we characterize a
CGP, in the sense that aggregate output grows at a constant rate, it is noteworthy that growth
is non-balanced since output, capital and employment in the two sectors grow at diﬀerent rates.

Given g2∗ ≥ g1∗ > 0, equations (33) and (34) imply condition that λ∗ = κ∗ = 1 [in the case where

s = 2, we would have λ∗ = κ∗ = 0] and Lemma 2 implies that we must also have g ∗ = g1∗ .

This condition together with our system of equations, (27) , (45) and (46), solves uniquely
for n∗1 , n∗2 , z1∗ , z2∗ , g1∗ and g2∗ as given in equations (48), (49), (50) and (51). Note that this
solution is consistent with g2∗ > g1∗ > 0, since Assumptions A1 and A2 imply that g2∗ > g1∗ and
∗ , is equal
g1∗ > 0. Finally, C ≤ Y , (14) and (44) imply that the consumption growth rate, gC

to the growth rate of output, g ∗ . [Suppose not, then since C/Y → 0 as t → ∞, the budget
constraint (14) implies that asymptotically K̇ (t) = Y (t), and integrating the budget constraint
Rt
gives K (t) → 0 Y (s) ds, implying that the capital stock grows more than exponentially, since

Y is growing exponentially; this would naturally violate the transversality condition (44)].

Finally, we can verify that an equilibrium with z1∗ , z2∗ , m∗1 , m∗2 , g1∗ and g2∗ satisfies the
transversality condition (44). Note that the transversality condition (44) will be satisfied if

Combining these equations implies that g1∗ < g2∗ , which contradicts the hypothesis g1∗ ≥

g2∗ > 0. The argument for ε > 1 is analogous.

2. Suppose g2∗ ≥ g1∗ and ε < 1, then the same steps as above imply that there is a unique
solution to equilibrium conditions (27), (45) and (46), which are given by equations (48),
(49), (50) and (51). But now (48) directly contradicts g1∗ ≤ 0. Finally suppose g2∗ ≥ g1∗
and ε > 1, then the unique solution is given by (53), (54), (55) and (56). But in this
case, (55) directly contradicts the hypothesis that g1∗ ≤ 0, completing the proof.

There are a number of important implications of this theorem. First, as long as m1 /α1 6=
m2 /α2 , growth is non-balanced. The intuition for this result is the same as Theorem 1 in the
previous section. Suppose, for concreteness, that m1 /α1 < m2 /α2 (which would be the case,
for example, if m1 ≈ m2 ). Then, diﬀerential capital intensities in the two sectors combined
with capital deepening in the economy (which itself results from technological progress) ensure
faster growth in the more capital-intensive sector, sector 2. Intuitively, if capital were allocated
proportionately to the two sectors, sector 2 would grow faster. Because of the changes in prices,
capital and labor are reallocated in favor of the less capital-intensive sector, so that relative
employment in sector 1 increases. However, crucially, this reallocation is not enough to fully
oﬀset the faster growth of real output in the more capital-intensive sector. This result also
highlights that the assumption of balanced technological progress in Theorem 1 (which, in this
context, corresponds to m1 = m2 ) was not necessary for the result, but we simply needed to
rule out the precise relative rate of technological progress between the two sectors that would
ensure balanced growth (in this context, m1 /α1 = m2 /α2 ).
Second, while the CGP growth rates look somewhat complicated because they are written in
the general case, they are relatively simple once we restrict attention to parts of the parameter
space. For instance, when m1 /α1 < m2 /α2 , the capital-intensive sector (sector 2) always grows
faster than the labor-intensive one, i.e., g1∗ < g2∗ . In addition if ε < 1, the more slowly-growing
labor-intensive sector dominates the asymptotic behavior of the economy, and the CGP growth

Third, as the proof of Theorem 3 makes it clear, in the limiting equilibrium the share
of capital and labor allocated to one of the sector tends to one (e.g., when sector 1 is the
asymptotically dominant sector, λ∗ = κ∗ = 1). Nevertheless, at all points in time both sectors
produce positive amounts, so this limit point is never reached. In fact, at all times both
sectors grow at rates greater than the rate of population growth in the economy. Moreover,
when ε < 1, the sector that is shrinking grows faster than the rest of the economy at all point
in time, even asymptotically. Therefore, the rate at which capital and labor are allocated away
from this sector is determined in equilibrium to be exactly such that this sector still grows
faster than the rest of the economy. This is the sense in which non-balanced growth is not a
trivial outcome in this economy (with one of the sectors shutting down), but results from the
positive but diﬀerential growth of the two sectors.
Finally, it can be verified that the share of capital in national income and the interest rate
are constant in the CGP. For example, when m1 /α1 < m2 /α2 , σ ∗K = 1−α1 and when m1 /α1 >
m2 /α2 ,σ ∗K = 1−α2 –in other words, the asymptotic capital share in national income will reflect
the capital share of the dominant sector. The limiting interest rate, on the other hand, will
ε

ε

be equal to r∗ = (1 − α1 ) γ ε−1 (χ∗ )−α1 in the first case and r∗ = (1 − α2 ) γ ε−1 (χ∗ )−α2 in the

second case, where χ∗ is eﬀective capital-labor ratio defined in equation (57) below. These

results are the basis of the claim in the Introduction that this equilibrium may account for
non-balanced growth at the sectoral level, without substantially deviating from the Kaldor
facts. In particular, the constant growth path equilibrium matches both the Kaldor facts
and generates unequal growth between the two sectors. However, in this constant growth
path equilibrium, one of the sectors has already become very small relative to the other.
25

Therefore, this theorem does not answer whether along the equilibrium path (but away from
the asymptotic equilibrium), we can have a situation in which both sectors have non-trivial
employment levels and the equilibrium capital share in national income and the interest rate
are approximately constant. This question and the stability of the constant growth path
equilibrium are investigated next.

3.6

Dynamics and Stability

The previous section characterized the asymptotic equilibrium, and established the existence
of a unique constant growth path. This growth path exhibits non-balanced growth, though
asymptotically the economy grows at a constant rate and the share of capital in national
income is constant. We now study the equilibrium behavior of this economy away from this
asymptotic equilibrium.
The equilibrium behavior away from the asymptotic equilibrium path can be represented by
a dynamical system characterizing the behavior of a control variable C and four state variables
K, L, M1 and M2 . The dynamics of aggregate consumption, C, and aggregate capital stock,
K, are given by the Euler equation (43) and the resource constraint (16). Furthemore, the
dynamic behavior of L is given by (12) and those of M1 and M2 are given by (21).
As noted above, when ε > 1, the sector which grows faster dominates the economy, while
when ε < 1, conversely, the slower sector dominates. We will show that in both cases the
unique CGP of the previous section is locally stable. Without loss of generality, we restrict the
discussion to the case in which asymptotically the economy is dominated by the labor-intensive
sector, sector 1, so that
g ∗ = g1∗ = z1∗ = n +

1
m1 .
α1 (ν − 1)

This means that when we assume ε < 1, the relevant part of the parameter space is where
m1 /α1 < m2 /α2 , and, when ε > 1, we must have m1 /α1 > m2 /α2 (for the rest of the parameter
space, it would be sector 2 that dominates the asymptotic behavior, and the same results apply
analogously).
The equilibrium behavior of this economy can be represented by a system of autonomous
non-linear diﬀerential equations in three variables,

and κ.

(57)

Here c is the level of consumption normalized by population and technology (of the sector that
will dominate the asymptotic behavior) and is the only control variable; χ is the capital stock
normalized by the same denominator, and κ determines the allocation of capital between the
two sectors. These two are state variables with given initial conditions χ (0) and κ (0).16

Since there are two state and one control variable, local (saddle-path) stability requires
the existence of a (unique) two-dimensional manifold of solutions in the neighborhood of the
steady state that converge to c∗ , χ∗ and κ∗ . The next theorem states that this is the case.
Theorem 4 The non-linear system (58) is locally (saddle-path) stable, in the sense that in
the neighborhood of c∗ , χ∗ and κ∗ , there is a unique two-dimensional manifold of solutions
that converge to c∗ , χ∗ and κ∗ .
16

χ (0) is given by definition, and κ (0) is uniquely pinned down by the static equilibrium allocation of capital
at time t = 0, given by (33).

The determinant of the Jacobian is det (J (x∗ )) = −aκκ acχ aχc . The above expressions show

that acχ and aχc are negative. Next, it can be seen that aκκ is always negative since ε ≶ 1 ⇔

m2 /α2 ≷ m1 /α1 . [As noted above, this is not a parameter restriction. For example, when ε > 1
and m2 /α2 > m1 /α1 , it will be sector 2 that grows more slowly in the limit, and stability will

again obtain]. The fact that aκκ < 0 immediately implies that det (J (x∗ )) > 0, so the steady
state is hyperbolic. Moreover, either all the eigenvalues are positive or two of them are negative
and one is positive. To determine which is the case, we look at the characteristic equation
given by det (J (x∗ ) − vI) = 0, where v denotes the vector of the eigenvalues. This equation
can be expressed as the following cubic in v, with roots corresponding to the eigenvalues:
(aκκ − v) [v (aχχ − v) + aχc acχ ] = 0.
28

This expression shows that one of the eigenvalue is equal to aκκ and thus negative, so there
must be two negative eigenvalues. This establishes the existence of a unique two-dimensional
manifold of solutions in the neighborhood of this steady state, converging to it. This proves
local (saddle-path) stability.
This result shows that the constant growth path equilibrium is locally stable, and when
the initial values of capital, labor and technology are not too far from the constant growth
path, the economy will indeed converge to this equilibrium, with non-balanced growth at the
sectoral level and constant capital share and interest rate at the aggregate.

A Simple Calibration

We now undertake an illustrative calibration of the model presented in Section 3 to investigate
whether the equilibrium dynamics generated by our model economy are broadly consistent
with non-balanced growth at the sectoral level and the aggregate Kaldor facts in the US data.
To do this, we use by-industry data on value added and employment and national data on
capital from NIPA as described in Appendix B. To map our model economy to data, we
classify the NIPA two-digit (22-level) industries into low and high capital intensity “sectors”,
each comprising approximately 50% of total employment. High capital intensity sectors have
capital share in value added of greater than 0.35. Appendix B and Table B1 provide more
details on the classification of the sectors. This division of sectors into high and low capital
intensity sectors is also the one used in Figure 2. We use this division of sectors together with
other aggregate data from NIPA for the calibration of our benchmark model.
It can be verified that in our benchmark model γ, M1 and M2 do not matter separately.

Instead, all expressions are in terms of B1 ≡ γ ε−1 M1ν−1 and B2 ≡ (1 − γ) ε−1 M2ν−1 . Consequently, our model economy is fully characterized by eight parameters, ε, α1 , α2 , ρ, θ, n,
m̂1 ≡ m1 / (ν − 1) and m̂2 ≡ m1 / (ν − 1), and six initial values, L (0), K (0), B1 (0), B2 (0),

Y1N (0) and Y2N (0), where YjN ’s refer to nominal output levels (thus in terms of our model,
YjN (0) = pj (0) Yj (0)).
We choose a period to correspond to a year and take the initial year, t = 0, to correspond
to the first year for which we have NIPA data for our sectors, 1948. We adopt the following
standard parameter values:
• 1% annual population growth, n = 0.01;
29

• 2% annual discount rate, ρ = 0.02;
• 10% annual asymptotic “rental rate” of capital, r∗ = 0.10;
• 2% annual asymptotic growth rate, g ∗ = 0.02;17
Our classification of industries creates two sectors, with corresponding shares of labor in
value added of 0.72 and 0.52. Consequently we take α1 = 0.72 and α2 = 0.52 (see Appendix
B). For our benchmark calibration we set m̂1 = m̂2 , so that the asymptotically dominant sector
will be the less capital-intensive sector, sector 1. In this case, our model economy implies that
the asymptotic growth rate of aggregate output satisfies
g ∗ = g1∗ = n + m̂1 /α1 ,
which, together with the values for g ∗ , n and α1 , implies m̂1 = m̂2 = 0.0072. We will report
robustness checks for diﬀerent levels of m̂2 below (while keeping sector 1 the asymptotically
dominant sector). The general patterns implied by our model are not sensitive to the exact
value of m̂2 . Note also that, since sector 1 is the asymptotically dominant sector, our model
pins down the asymptotic share of capital in national income as σ ∗K = 1 − α1 = 0.28, which is
lower than the share of capital in the US data shown in Figure 1.
Moreover, since the growth rate of consumption and output have to be equal asymptotically,
the Euler equation (43) implies that g ∗ = (r∗ − ρ) /θ, thus θ = 4, which results in a reasonable
elasticity of intertemporal substitution of 0.25.
From NIPA, we take the following data for 1948: L (0) = 37, 169, K (0) = 560, 000,
Y1N (0) = 85, 885, Y2N (0) = 108, 473, Y N (0) = 194, 358, where Y N (0) refers to total nominal
output in all the sectors under consideration. Employment is in terms of full-time equivalents in thousands, while all the other figures are in terms of (current) millions of dollars (see
Appendix B). These numbers will be used to determine the initial values for our calibration.
Next, notice that equation (33) can be rewritten as:
¶
¸−1

1 − α2 Y2N

κ= 1+

17
These numbers are the same as those used by Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2004) in their calibration of the
baseline neoclassical model. The only diﬀerence is that since there is no depreciation in our model, we choose
r as 10% to correspond to the rental rate of capital inclusive of depreciation.

30

This equation together with the 1948 levels of nominal output in the two sectors, Y1N (0) and
Y2N (0), from NIPA pins down κ (0). Equation (34) then gives the initial value of relative
employment, λ (0). These implied values are:
λ (0) = 0.52 and κ (0) = 0.32.
We can also compute an empirical equivalent of λ (0) from NIPA data using employment in
diﬀerent industries. Reassuringly, this empirical counterpart to λ (0) is approximately 0.46,
which is reasonably close to the number implied by our model. Moreover, these numbers also
pin down the initial interest rate and the capital share in national income as r (0) = 0.14 and
σ K (0) = 0.39.18 Recall that we chose the asymptotic interest rate as r∗ = 0.10 and our model
economy implies that the limiting capital share is σ ∗K = 0.28, thus both the interest rate and
the capital share must decline at some point along the transition path. A key question concerns
the speed of these declines.
We also choose ε = 0.5 as our benchmark value, which is consistent with the evidence
discussed in footnote 5. We will experiment with diﬀerent values of ε and show that the
precise value of the elasticity of substitution does not matter for the patterns documented in
our calibration.
This only leaves the initial values of B1 (0) and B2 (0) to be determined. We do this using
equations (22) and (28) combined with the data from NIPA for Y1N (0), Y2N (0) and Y N (0)
introduced above. In particular, with the transformed variables, equation (22) can be rewritten
as:
Y1N (0)

This equation combined with the production function from (28) yields the initial values B1 (0)
and B2 (0) necessary for our calibration exercise.
Figure 3 shows the results of the benchmark calibration.19 The four panels depict relative
employment in sector 1 (λ), relative capital in sector 1 (κ), the interest rate (r) and the

For the capital share, we use equation (89) in Appendix B. For the interest rate, we use equation (31) or
(32), together with the aggregate capital stock of the economy.
19
To compute the dynamics of our calibrated economy, we first represent the equilibrium as a two-dimensional
non-autonomous system in c and χ (rather than the three-dimensional autonomous system analyzed above)
since κ can be represented as a function of time only. This two dimensional system has one state and one
control variable. Following Judd (1998, chapter 10), we then discretize these diﬀerential equations using the
Euler method, and turn them into a system of first-order diﬀerence equations in ct and χt , which can itself be
transformed into a second-order non-autonomous system only in χt . We compute a numerical solution to the

31

capital share in national income (σ K ). The solid line is for the benchmark economy, with
m̂1 = m̂2 = 0.0072 and ε = 0.5. The other two lines show the results of the calibration for
ε = 0.4 and ε = 0.6 (while keeping m̂2 = 0.0072).

Figure 3: Behavior of κ, λ, r and σ K in the model economy. Solid line: benchmark model,
m̂2 = 0.0072, ε = 0.5. Dotted line: m̂2 = 0.0072, ε = 0.4. Dashed line: m̂2 = 0.0072, ε = 0.6.
See text for further details.
Let us first focus on the benchmark simulation, given by the solid line in Figure 3. The first
noteworthy feature is the rate of convergence. The units on the horizontal axis are years and
range from 0 to 3000. This shows that it takes a very long time for the fraction of capital and
labor allocated to sector 1 to approach their asymptotic equilibrium value of 1. For example,
second-order diﬀerence equation by choosing a polynomial form for the endogenous variables:
(ct , κt , χt ) = F (t; θ) .
We find the vector θ that minimizes the squared residuals of the diﬀerence equations, using non-linear least
squares (see, e.g., Judd, 1998, chapter 4).

32

initially, about 52% of employment is in sector 1, and after 500 years, this number has increased
only to about 70%. The implied allocation of capital between the two sectors is a similar. This
illustrates that even though in the limiting equilibrium one of the sectors employs all of the
factors, it takes a very long time for the economy to approach this limit point. Second, the
rental rate of capital (or the interest rate) follows a non-monotonic pattern, but does not vary
by much (remaining between 6% and 10% for most of the 3000 years). Third, the share of
capital in national income is declining visibly. As noted above, this is by construction, since
the initial capital share is set as σ K (0) = 0.39, while the model implies that the asymptotic
capital share is σ ∗K = 0.28. More importantly, the decline of the capital share is relatively
slow.
These patterns can be seen most clearly in Table 1, which shows US data from 1948 to 2004
for the relative (real) output and employment of the high and low capital intensity sectors and
the capital share in national income (see Appendix B) as well as the results from the calibration
of the model for the same time period. In particular, since t = 0 for the calibration is taken to
be 1948, the implied numbers for 2004 are given by the calibration for the time period t = 56.
The first two columns of this table confirm the pattern shown in Figure 2 in the Introduction;
real output grows faster in high capital intensity sectors, while employment grows faster in
low capital intensity sectors. The next two columns show that the benchmark calibration is
consistent with this pattern, though the magnitude of changes is somewhat smaller in the
calibration than in the data. For example, Y2 /Y1 increases by about 25% in the data between
1948 and 2004, while the increase is about 15% in the benchmark calibration. Similarly, L2 /L1
declines by about 33% in the data, while the implied decline in the model is about 12%.20
The movements of the capital share in national income, on the other hand, are similar in both
cases. In the data there is a decline from 0.41 to 0.39 between 1948 and 2004, whereas in
the model there is a slightly smaller decline from 0.39 to 0.38. These results suggest that our
model economy generates changes in the relative output and employment of the two sectors
that are quantitatively as well as qualitatively plausible, even though the magnitudes of the
changes are about half as large as those in the data.

20

Note that the initial values of Y2 /Y1 and L2 /L1 (and λ) are not the same in the data and in the benchmark
model, since, as explained above, we chose the sectoral allocation of labor implied by the model given the relative
nominal outputs of the two sectors (recall equation (60)).

The other columns of the table show that the results are broadly similar for other values
of the elasticity of substitution, ε. When ε is smaller than the benchmark value of ε = 0.5, the
change in relative employment levels is similar to the benchmark, and the change in relative
output levels is somewhat smaller. Interestingly, when ε is larger, both employment and output
movements are larger and more comparable to the data. For example, Table 1 shows that for
ε = 0.6, the implied increase in Y2 /Y1 between 1948 and 2004 is 25% as in the data.
Figure 4 and Table 2 show the results of the calibration for diﬀerent values of m̂2 , again
together with the benchmark for comparison. The broad patterns implied by diﬀerent values of
m̂2 are again similar to the benchmark calibration. When m̂2 is taken to be smaller (0.0062),
the changes in Y2 /Y1 and L2 /L1 are somewhat less pronounced; in contrast when m̂2 is taken
to be 0.0082, there are greater relative employment and relative output changes. For example,
with m̂2 = 0.0082, Y2 /Y1 increases by about 28%, while L2 /L1 declines by almost 15%.

We have also experimented with diﬀerent values of ε and m̂2 (subject to the constraint

are very similar if we use the initial value of λ (0) implied by the sectoral employment data

rather than the value implied by equation (60) above and the ratio of nominal output levels
from NIPA (i.e., λ (0) equal to 0.46 instead of 0.52). These details are available upon request.
Overall, we interpret the findings in this section as indicating that the mechanism proposed
in this paper is capable of generating changes in the sectoral composition of employment and
output that are broadly comparable with, though about half of the magnitude as, the changes
we observe in the US data. Since the model does not include non-homothetic preferences, the
fact that the magnitudes are somewhat smaller than those in the data is in fact reassuring
and suggests that a more complete model incorporating both the mechanism proposed in this
paper and non-homothetic preferences is worth investigating theoretically and quantitatively.

Non-Balanced Endogenous Growth

In this section we introduce endogenous technological progress. This investigation has two
objectives. As already emphasized, non-balanced growth results from capital deepening, and so
far, capital deepening was a consequence of exogenous technological change. The first question
is whether endogenous technological change might restore balanced growth. The analysis in
this section will show that this is not the case. Second, endogenizing technological change in
this context enables us to derive a model of non-balanced endogenous technological change,
which is an important direction for models of endogenous technology, given the non-balanced
nature of growth in the data. In particular, we will see that diﬀerences in capital intensity
between sectors naturally lead to non-balanced endogenous technological progress.
Demographics, preferences and technology are the same as described in Section 3, with two
diﬀerences. First, instead of the exogenous processes for technology given in (21), we now need
to specify an innovation possibilities frontier, i.e., the technology to transform resources into
blueprints for new varieties in the two sectors. We assume that
Ṁ1 = b1 M1−ϕ X1 and Ṁ2 = b2 M2−ϕ X2 ,

(61)

where X1 ≥ 0 and X2 ≥ 0 are research expenditures in terms of the final good, b1 and b2 are
strictly positive constants measuring the technical diﬃculty of creating new blueprints in the
two sectors, and ϕ ∈ (−1, ∞) measures the degree of spillovers in technology creation.21
Second, we assume that firms that invent blueprints for intermediates in either sector
become the monopolist supplier of that intermediate, with a fully-enforced perpetual patent.
There is free entry into research, which means that any firm can make use of the innovation
possibilities frontier (61) in order to invent new varieties.
The value of the monopolist for intermediate i in sector s is given by
∙ Z v

Vs (i, t) =

21

When ϕ = 0, there are no spillovers from the current stock of knowledge to future innovations. With ϕ < 0,
there are positive spillovers and the stock of knowledge in a particular sector makes further innovation in that
sector easier. With ϕ > 0, there are negative spillovers (“fishing out”) and further innovations are more diﬃcult
in sectors that are more advanced (see, for example, Jones, 1995, Kortum, 1997). Similar to the results in Jones
(1995), Young (1999) and Howitt (1999), there will be endogenous growth for a range of values of ϕ because
of population growth. In the remainder, we will typically think of ϕ > 0, so that there are negative spillovers,
though this is not important for any of the asymptotic results.
Also, this innovation possibilities frontier assumes that only the final good is used to generate new technologies.
The alternative is to have a scarce factor, such as labor or scientists, in which case some amount of positive
spillovers would be necessary to generate endogenous growth.

36

for s = 1, 2, where π s (i, t) = (qs (i, t) − mcs (i, t)) ys (i, t) is the flow profits for firm i at time
t, with qs given by the iso-elastic demand curves in (23) in Section 3, and mcs is the marginal
cost of production in this sector, which was also defined in Section 3. In equilibrium, all firms
in the same sector will make the same profits, so Vs (i, t) = Vs (t), and we use V1 (t) and V2 (t)
to denote the values of firms in the two sectors at time t.
Each monopolist chooses its price to maximize (62). Since demands are iso-elastic and
prices at time t only influence revenues and costs at that point, profit-maximizing prices will
be given by a constant markup over marginal cost:

These prices are identical to the intermediate prices in Section 3, (24) and (25), except for
the presence of the markup terms, ν/ (ν − 1). Now, combining equations (22), (23), (26) and
(27) from Section 3 (which all still apply in the endogenous growth economy), the prices for
1

1

the labor- and capital-intensive intermediates can be expressed as q1 = γM1ν−1 (Y1 /Y )− ε and
1

1

q2 = (1 − γ) M2ν−1 (Y2 /Y )− ε . These prices combined again with (26) and (27) and the fact
that there is a markup of ν/ (ν − 1) over marginal costs enable us to write the flow profits
from the sale of the labor- and capital-intensive intermediates as:

Even though factor prices include the markup term (ν − 1) /ν, this markup is the same in both
sectors. Consequently, the allocation of capital in labor between the two sectors is unchanged
and is still determined by equations (33) and (34) in Section 3.
Given the value for being the monopolist for intermediate in (62), the free entry conditions
take the following form:

V1 ≤

with each condition holding as equality when there is positive R&D expenditure for that sector,
i.e., when X1 > 0 or X2 > 0.
The resource constraint of the economy is also modified to incorporate the R&D expenditures becomes
K̇ + C + X1 + X2 ≤ Y.

(69)

Finally, the problem of consumer optimization is similar to that in Section 3. In particular,
the Euler equation is still given by (43), but the transversality condition needs to be modified
because of corporate profits. The financial wealth of the representative consumer now comes
from payments to capital and profits and is thus given by W (t) = K (t) + M1 (t) V1 (t) +
M2 (t) V2 (t), where recall that V1 (t) is the present discounted value of the profits of a firm in
the sector 1 at time t and there are M1 (t) such firms, and similarly for V2 (t) and M2 (t). The
relevant transversality condition can then be written as

Definition 5 A dynamic equilibrium is given by paths of wages and interest rates, w and
r, labor and capital allocation decisions, λ and κ, satisfying (33), (34), (66) and (67), and of
consumption C, employment, L, capital stock, K, technology, M1 and M2 values of innovation,
V1 and V2 , and research expenditures, X1 and X2 , satisfying (12), (43), (61), (62), (68), (69)
and (70).
It is also useful to define a path that satisfies all of these equations, possibly except the
transversality condition, (70), as a quasi-equilibrium.
Since the case with ε < 1 is both more interesting, and in view of the discussion in footnote
5, also more realistic, in this section we focus on this case exclusively.
We first note that Propositions 1 and 2 from Section 3 still apply and characterize the
comparative static responses. Moreover, Lemmas 1 and 2 from Section 3 continue to determine
the behavior of the growth rate of sectoral output, capital and employment. For the analysis
of the economy with endogenous technology, we also need an additional result in the next
lemma. It shows that provided that (i) ε < 1, (ii) there exists a constant asymptotic interest
rate r∗ (i.e., limt→∞ ṙ = 0), and (iii) there is positive population growth, in the asymptotic
equilibrium the free entry conditions in (68) will both hold as equality:

38

Lemma 3 Suppose that ε < 1, n > 0, and limt→∞ ṙ = 0, then limt→∞ (V1 − M1ϕ /b1 ) = 0 and

limt→∞ (V2 − M2ϕ /b2 ) = 0.

Proof. See Appendix A.
This lemma is an important result for the analysis of non-balanced endogenous growth. It
implies that both free-entry conditions must hold as equalities in the limiting equilibrium and
thus enables us to solve for the asymptotic growth rates from the free entry conditions and
obtain a relatively simple characterization of the constant growth path equilibrium.
The economic intuition for the lemma comes from population growth; with population
growth, it is always optimal to allocate more capital to each sector, which increases the profitability of intermediate producers in that sector. Consequently, the value of a new blueprint
increases asymptotically. This rules out asymptotic equilibrium paths with slack free-entry
conditions, because along such paths, the cost of creating a new blueprint would remain constant, ultimately violating the free-entry condition.
To establish the existence of a CGP, we now impose the following parameter restriction,
which replaces (A2) in the exogenous technology case:
α1 ζ > 1 and ρ > (1 − θ)

α1 ζ
n,
α1 ζ − 1

(A3)

where ζ ≡ (ν − 1) (1 + ϕ). Assumption A3 ensures that the transversality condition (70)
holds. Notice that in contrast to Assumption A2 only α1 features in this condition; this is
because Assumption A1 already imposed that α1 < α2 , and with endogenous technology, this
is suﬃcient to make sector 1 the more slowly growing sector in the asymptotic equilibrium.
Assumption A3 also rules out quasi-equilibrium paths where output and consumption grow
more than exponentially. This is stated in the next lemma.
Lemma 4 Suppose Assumption A3 holds and ε < 1, then there exists no quasi-equilibria with
limt→∞ Ċ/C = ∞.
This lemma is also proved in Appendix A, where, for completeness, we also show that
Assumption A3 is “tight” in the sense that, if first inequality in this assumption did not
hold, there always exist quasi-equilibria with more than exponential growth (which would also
naturally violate the transversality condition). The proof of this lemma also makes clear that
the second part of Assumption A3 is also necessary for the transversality condition.
39

Lemmas 3 and 4 together imply that the asymptotic equilibrium has to converge either
to a limit with constant growth of consumption, or to a limit cycle. Using these results, the
next theorem establishes the existence of a unique constant growth path, with non-balanced
sectoral growth, but constant share of capital and constant interest rate in the aggregate. This
theorem is therefore the analogue of Theorem 3 in Section 3.

Proof. See Appendix A.
A number of features are worth noting. First, this theorem shows that the equilibrium of
this non-balanced endogenous growth economy takes a relatively simple form. Second, given
the equilibrium rates of technological change in the two sectors, m∗1 and m∗2 , the asymptotic
growth rates are identical to those in Theorem 3 in Section 3, so that the economy with
endogenous technological change gives the same insights as the one with exogenous technology.
In particular, there is non-balanced sectoral growth, but in the aggregate, the economy has a
limiting equilibrium with constant share of capital in national income and a constant interest
rate.
Finally and interestingly, technology is also endogenously non-balanced, and in fact, tries
to counteract the non-balanced nature of economic growth. Specifically, there is more technological change towards the sector that is growing more slowly (recall we are focusing on
the case where ε < 1), so that the sector with lower capital intensity employs an increasing
share of the capital and labor in the economy and over time has access to increasingly superior
technology. Nevertheless, this sector still grows more slowly than the more capital-intensive
sector, and the non-balanced nature of the growth process remains. Therefore, endogenous
40

growth does not restore balance between the two sectors as long as capital intensity (factor
proportion) diﬀerences between the two sectors remain.
Unfortunately, we do not have an equivalent of Theorem 4 for the endogenous growth
economy. The reason is that there are two more endogenous state variables and two more
control variables now, so the dynamical system includes c, χ, κ, M1 , M2 , X1 and X2 (or
their stationary transformations). Given the size of this system, we are unable to prove local
(saddle-path) stability. Nevertheless, Lemmas 3 and 4 imply that the system cannot lead to
an explosive path, thus it has two tend to a constant growth path or settle into a limit cycle.

Conclusions

This paper shows how diﬀerences in factor proportions across sectors combined with capital
deepening lead to a non-balanced pattern of economic growth. We first illustrated this point
using a general two-sector growth model, and then characterized the equilibrium fully using a
class of economies with constant elasticity of substitution between sectors and Cobb-Douglas
production technologies. This class of economies shows how the pattern of equilibrium may
be consistent with both non-balanced sectoral growth and the aggregate Kaldor facts, in particular, approximately constant share of capital in national income and interest rates. We
also constructed and analyzed a model with endogenous technology featuring non-balanced
economic growth.
The main contribution of the paper is theoretical, demonstrating that the interaction
between capital deepening and factor proportion diﬀerences across sectors will lead to nonbalanced growth, while still remaining consistent with the aggregate Kaldor facts. We also
presented a simple calibration of our baseline model, which showed that the equilibrium path
may indeed exhibit sectoral employment and output shares changing significantly, while the
aggregate capital share and the interest rate remain approximately constant. Moreover, the
magnitudes implied by this simple calibration are comparable to, though somewhat smaller
than, the sectoral changes observed in the the postwar US data. A full investigation of whether
the mechanism suggested in this paper is first-order in practice is an empirical question left
for future research. It would be particularly useful to combine the mechanism proposed in this
paper with non-homothetic preferences and estimate a structural version of the model with
multiple sectors using US or OECD data.

Step 3: lim supt→∞ (V1 − M1ϕ /b1 ) ≥ 0 and lim supt→∞ (V2 − M2ϕ /b2 ) ≥ 0.
Step 4: limt→∞ (V1 − M1ϕ /b1 ) = 0 and limt→∞ (V2 − M2ϕ /b2 ) = 0.
Proof of Step 1: We first prove that m∗1 = m∗2 = 0 imply g2∗ = g1∗ = n. To see this, combine

Then, from Lemma 1 n∗2 < n∗1 and z2∗ < z1∗ and from Lemma 2, g ∗ = g1∗ . Since limt→∞ ṙ = 0, equation
(46) and the fact that g ∗ = g1∗ imply that g1∗ = z1∗ . This combined with equation (77) and m∗1 = 0
implies that z1∗ = n∗1 = n, which together with (76) implies

yielding a contradiction. The argument for the case in which g2∗ < g1∗ is analogous. Since g2∗ = g1∗ = g ∗
and m∗1 = m∗2 = 0, it must also be the case that g2∗ = g1∗ = n, completing the proof of step 1.
Proof of Step 2: First note that lim supt→∞ (V1 − M1ϕ /b1 ) < 0 and
lim supt→∞ (V2 − M2ϕ /b2 ) < 0 imply that the free entry conditions, (68), are asymptotically slack, so
m∗1 and m∗2 exist, and limt→∞ m1 (t) = m∗1 = 0 and limt→∞ m2 (t) = m∗2 = 0 (since they cannot be
negative). In particular, note that if lim supt→∞ (V1 − M1ϕ /b1 ) < 0, this implies that there exists no
“infinitely-recurring” interval in the limit where the free entry condition holds for sector 1.
Now to derive a contradiction, suppose that m∗2 = m∗1 = 0, which, as shown above, implies g1∗ =
∗
g2 = g ∗ = n > 0. Then, diﬀerentiating the second equation in (65), we obtain:
π̇ 2
= g ∗ > 0.
t→∞ π 2
lim

(78)

Combining this with limt→∞ ṙ = 0 and the value function in (62) yields: limt→∞ V2 = ∞. Since
m∗2 = 0 by hypothesis, M2−ϕ is constant, and we have limt→∞ V2 = ∞ > limt→∞ M2ϕ /b2 , violating the free entry condition (68). This proves that m∗1 and m∗2 cannot both equal to 0, and thus
lim supt→∞ (V2 − M2ϕ /b2 ) < 0 and lim supt→∞ (V1 − M1ϕ /b1 ) < 0 is not possible.
Proof of Step 3: We next prove that lim supt→∞ (V1 − M1ϕ /b1 ) ≥ 0,
lim supt→∞ (V2 − M2ϕ /b2 ) ≥ 0, lim supt→∞ m1 > 0 and lim supt→∞ m2 > 0.

42

Suppose, to derive a contradiction, lim supt→∞ m2 = m∗2 = 0 and
lim supt→∞ (V2 − M2ϕ /b2 ) < 0 (the other case is proved analogously). Since, as shown above, m∗1 =
m∗2 = 0 is not possible, we must have lim supt→∞ (V1 − M1ϕ /b1 ) ≥ 0 and lim supt→∞ m1 > 0.
We start by noting from (65), that asymptotically

from (32), z2 > 0 implies that limt→∞ π̇ 2 /π 2 > 0. But by the same argument as in Step 2, we have
limt→∞ V2 = ∞ > limt→∞ M2ϕ /b2 , violating the free entry condition (68). We therefore only have
to show that z2 > 0 (which would naturally imply that lim supt→∞ z2 > 0). Suppose, to obtain a
contradiction, that z2∗ = 0. Using (45) and (46) from the proof of Lemma 1, we have z2 − n2 = z1 − n1 ,
which implies that n∗2 = 0 (recall that either n1 ≥ n or n2 ≥ n, and since limt→∞ g ≥ n, either
z1 ≥ n or z2 ≥ n). But then with n∗2 = z2∗ = m∗2 = 0, we have g2∗ = 0 < g1∗ , which contradicts
n∗2 < n∗1 = n from Lemma 1. A similar argument for the other sector completes the proof that
lim supt→∞ (V1 − M1ϕ /b1 ) ≥ 0 and lim supt→∞ (V2 − M2ϕ /b2 ) ≥ 0.
lim

t→∞

Proof of Step 4. From the free entry conditions in (68), we have that V1 − M1ϕ /b1 ≤ 0 and
V2 − M2ϕ /b2 ≤ 0, thus lim supt→∞ (V1 − M1ϕ /b1 ) ≤ 0 and lim supt→∞ (V2 − M2ϕ /b2 ) ≤ 0. Combined
with Step 3, this implies lim supt→∞ (V1 − M1ϕ /b1 ) = 0 and
lim supt→∞ (V2 − M2ϕ /b2 ) = 0. Hence, we only have to prove that lim inf t→∞ (V1 − M1ϕ /b1 ) ≥ 0 and
lim inf t→∞ (V2 − M2ϕ /b2 ) ≥ 0. We prove the first inequality (the proof of the second is similar).
Suppose, to derive a contradiction, that lim inf t→∞ (V1 − M1ϕ /b1 ) < 0. This implies that there exists
a (recurring) interval (t00 , t02 ) such that V1 (t) − M1ϕ (t) /b1 < 0 for all t ∈ (t00 , t02 ). Suppose that (t00 , t02 )
is unbounded; this would imply that lim supt→∞ m1 = m∗1 = 0, yielding a contradiction with Step
2. Thus (t00 , t02 ) must be bounded, so there exists (t0 , t2 ) ⊃ (t00 , t02 ) such that for t ∈ (t0 , t2 ) \ (t00 , t02 ),
we have V1 (t) − M1ϕ (t) /b1 = 0. Moreover, since lim supt→∞ m1 > 0, there also exists an interval
(t000 , t002 ) ⊃ (t0 , t2 ) such that for all t ∈ (t0 , t2 ) \ (t000 , t002 ), m1 > 0.
Next, since m1 = 0 for all t ∈ (t00 , t02 ), we also have M1 (t00 ) = M1 (t02 ). This implies
V1 (t02 ) =

M1ϕ (t00 )
= V1 (t00 ) .

Equation (81) also shows that V̇1 (t) is well-defined, so V1 (t) is continuously diﬀeretiable in t. Equation
(80) and the fact that V1 (t) − M1ϕ (t00 ) /b1 < 0 for all t ∈ (t00 , t02 ) imply that V1 (t) reaches a minimum
over (t00 , t02 ) with V̇1 (t) = 0. Let t01 < t02 be such that V1 (t01 ) is the first local minimum after t00 , which
naturally satisfies V1 (t01 ) < V1 (t00 ). Moreover, using (65) and (67), we have that for all t

obtain that since m1 = 0 and n > 0, K1 (t01 ) > K1 (t00 ). In addition, since M1 (t01 ) = M1 (t00 ), we can

Proof of Lemma 4 and The Converse Result

Proof of Lemma 4: First, recall that C ≤ Y , (14). Hence it is enough to prove that limt→∞ g = ∞
will violate the resource constraint. We will prove this separately in two cases, when g2∗ ≥ g1∗ and when
g2∗ < g1∗
Suppose g2∗ ≥ g1∗ and g ∗ = ∞. Recall that Lemmas 1 and 2 from Section 3 still apply. In particular,
Lemma 2 implies g1∗ = g ∗ = ∞, and equation (46) together with (77) yields

Then, the first inequality in Assumption A3, ζ > 1/α1 , implies
lim

which violates the resource constraint (69).
Next suppose that g1∗ > g2∗ and g ∗ = ∞. Then, following the same steps above, Lemma 2 implies

g2 = g ∗ = ∞, and equation (46) together with (45) and (77) yields

which violates the resource constraint (69), completing the proof that when Assumption A3 holds, any
quasi-equilibrium with more than exponential growth violates the resource constraint. ¥
For completeness, we also prove the converse of Lemma 4, which shows that the use of the first
inequality in Assumption A3, ζ > 1/α1 , in this lemma is “tight” in the sense that, if it were relaxed,
the opposite result would obtain.
Lemma 4’: Suppose A1 holds, but ζ ≡ (ν − 1) (1 − ϕ) ≤ 1/α1 , then there exists quasi-equilibria
with limt→∞ g = ∞.
Proof. This lemma will be proved by showing that in this case
g2∗ = g1∗ = g ∗ = ∞

z2∗ = z1∗ = z ∗

and

z∗ = g∗ −

Next, from the technology possibilities frontiers, (61), feasibility requires

and both these conditions are satisfied given the second equality of equation (86) and α1 > α2 .

7.3

Proof of Theorem 5

We prove this proposition in two steps.
Step 1: Provided that g2∗ ≥ g1∗ > 0, then there exists a unique CGP defined by equations (71),
(72), (73), (74) and (75), satisfying g2∗ > g1∗ > 0.
Step 2: All CGP must satisfy g2∗ ≥ g1∗ > 0.
Proof of Step 1. Lemma 3 establishes that as t → ∞ the free-entry conditions (68) must asymptotically hold as equality. Combining (68) as equality with (81) (and the equivalent for sector 2), we
obtain the following conditions that must hold as t → ∞:
γ
ν

¡ Y1 ¢− 1ε

and
b1

γ
ν

¡ Y2 ¢− 1ε

(87)

Diﬀerentiating (87) yields:
g1 −

1
1
(g1 − g) − (1 + ϕ) m1 = 0 and g2 − (g2 − g) − (1 + ϕ) m2 = 0.
ε
ε

(88)

Then g2∗ > g1∗ > 0 and Lemma 2 imply that we must also have g ∗ = g1∗ . This condition together our
system of equations, (45), (46), (77), (88), solves uniquely for n∗1 , n∗2 , z1∗ , z2∗ , m∗1 , m∗2 , g1∗ and g2∗ (and
κ∗ = λ∗ = 1) as given in equations (71), (72), (73), (74) and (75). Note that this solution is consistent
with g2∗ > g1∗ > 0, since Assumptions A1 and A3 immediately imply that g2∗ > g1∗ and g1∗ > 0 (which
is also consistent with Lemma 3). Finally, C ≤ Y , (14) and (44) imply that the consumption growth
∗
rate, gC
, is equal to the growth rate of output, g ∗ .
Finally, we can verify that an equilibrium with κ∗ , λ∗ , n∗1 , n∗2 , z1∗ , z2∗ , m∗1 , m∗2 , g1∗ and g2∗ satisfies
the transversality condition (44) with a similar argument to the one spelled in the first step of the proof
of Theorem 3 (since Assumption A3 ensures that g ∗ < r∗ ).
Proof of Step 2. The proof that along all CGPs g2∗ > g1∗ > 0 must be true, is analogous to the
one of the second step in the proof of Theorem 3. ¥

Appendix B: National Income Product Accounts Data

All the data used in the paper refer to US data and are from National Income and Product Accounts
(NIPA). Sectoral data are from the Gross Domestic Product by Industry Data of the NIPA. Sectors
are classified according to the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS). Throughout,
we use the 22-industry level of detail data, which corresponds to two-digit industries. This level of
aggregation enables us to extend the sample back to 1948. We exclude the Government and Private
household sectors as well as Agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting and Real estate and rental.
Agriculture is excluded since our focus is on services and manufacturing and the diﬀerence between
more and less capital-intensive sectors. Real estate is excluded since it has a very high capital share
due to the value of assets in this sector, which does not reflect the share of capital in the production
function of the sector. The nominal value added and employment figures for the aggregate economy we
use throughout exclude the sectors.
In Figure 1, “Services” are: Wholesale and Retail trade; Transportation and Warehousing; Information; Finance and Insurance; Professional, scientific, and technical services; Management of companies
and enterprises; Administrative and waste management services; Educational services; Health care and
social assistance; Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation; Accomodation and food services; Other services,
except government. Manufacturing includes: Mining; Utilities; Construction; Durable and Non-durable
goods.
Employment in Figure 1 and throughout is total full-time equivalent employment (FTE), in thousands, in the indicated industries. Real GDP is equal to expenditure-weighted sum of real value added.
More specifically, let S denote a subset of the two-digit sectors. Then real GDP in this subset of sectors
at time t is calculated as:
P
j∈S Ej,t · RVAj,t
S
P
real GDPt =
,
j∈S Ej,t

where RVAj,t is real value added in sector j at time t in 2000 dollars, obtained by deflating nominal
value added (VA) by NIPA’s chain-weighted price index (VAPI, and the corresponding chain-weighted
quantity index, VAQI), and Ej,t is expenditure on sector j at time t, approximated by nominal value
added.
The share of capital in national income is computed as value added minus total compensation to
employees over value added, i.e.,
Et − Wt
capital sharet =
,
(89)
Et

where Et is total nominal value added (VA) at time t and Wt is total nominal compensation to employees
(COMP) at time t.
The value of initial capital stock is the initial value of private fixed assets in current dollars.
In Figure 2 and in Section 4, sectors are classified according to their capital intensity. Capital
intensity in each sector is calculated as:
capital sharej,t =

Ej,t − Wj,t
,
Ej,t

(90)

where Ej,t is nominal value added in sector j at time t and Wj,t is nominal compensation to employees
in sector j at time t. Because of the change in the classification of industries before and after 1987, we
compute the capital share of each industry as the average between 1987 and 2004, which enables us to use
the consistent NAICS classification for the compensation series (before 1987 this variable is only available
with the SIC classification). Sectors are then ranked according to their average capital intensity as shown
in Table B1 below, and the capital share of 0.35 is chosen as the cutoﬀ level for separating industries into
high and low capital-intensity sectors, which creates two groups of industries, each with approximately
50% of employment. According to this ranking, low capital-intensity sectors are: Construction; Durable
goods; Transportation and Warehousing; Professional, scientific, and technical services; Management

47

of companies and enterprises; Administrative and waste management services; Educational services;
Health care and social assistance; Other services, except government. High capital-intensive sectors
are: Mining; Utilities; Non-durable goods; Wholesale; Retail trade; Information; Finance and Insurance;
Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation; Accomodation and food services. These industries, their average
capital shares and their allocations to sectors 1 and 2 are shown in Table B1.

Note: Capital shares refer to the average capital share between 1987 and 2004 for each
industry computed according to equation (90).

Finally, note that in both Figures 1 and 2, there is a slight break in the employment series in 1997
which is due to a change in the industry classification system used in the NIPA. The employment series
in NIPA are classified with the SIC system between 1948 and 1997 and using the the NAICS from 1998
onwards. We match the sectors in the two classifications using the correspondence tables constructed
by the US Census Bureau. We also use the same tables to extend total compensations to employees
back to 1948 in order to compute the initial aggregate capital share of the economy.
