Financial Crisis

ABSTRACT
The G20 Framework for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth builds on the claimthat growing
imbalances before the 2008 Financial Crisis were a major cause of the crisis, and the further claim
that reducing im balances post crisis must be a central part of any effort to prevent a further
occurrence. Analytical literature in economics seemingly does not provide satisfactory measures of
financial instability, either in individual national economies or in the combined global economy; nor
ways of linking imbalance change to either worsening or improving financial (or real) instability and
the onset of financial crises.
Here we focus on the external sector component of financial instability and link changes in country
imbalances to individual economy growth rates in ways when sum med across countries produce
indices of expected worsening or improving financial instability at different points in tim e. We
compute a variety of such indices for the years immediately before the 2008 Financial Crisis. We
use the sum of the absolute value of external
sector imbalances across countries (the trade
imbalance, or the current account imbalance) as a proportion of the combined GDP of countries and
link them in various ways to country growth ra tes. An increasing m easure under an index is an
indication of future widening excess demands and supplies over all countries as a group relative to
gross world product. This, in turn, is an indicati on of increasing severity of adjustment problems
ahead, and hence expected worsening f inancial instability. We compute such indices for all G20
countries, and various subsets of countries(G2, G8, G8+5) and exam ine their behavior over the
period 2004-2007.
Our results suggest that depending upon the index used and the base date chosen for comparative
purposes in determining changes, different implications emerge for the linkage between external
sector imbalances, perceived f uture instability and hence the onset of a f inancial crisis. The
implication we drawn is that the l inks between imbalances and both the onset and best policy
response to the 2008 Financial Crisis asserted by the G20 amy be more tenuous than claimed. Indeed
no such links were suggested earlier for the 1930s, the Asian Financial Crisis or any other crisis. In
turn economies have functioned with larger imbalances relative to GDP t han in 2008 for
considerable periods of time and with no financial implosion (UK in the pre World War I period;
Germany and Australia in the 1990s).

1. Introduction

The 2008 Financial Crisis saw large stock price, exchange rate, commodity price, and
housing price oscillations and these prompted a global policy response through the G20 with
the creation of a new Financial Stability Board (FSB), and the negotiation of a Framework for
Strong, Sustainable, and Balanced Growth (FSSBG) to provide for a sustainable recovery. But
central to these two initiatives are the twin presumptions that in some sense growing global
imbalances were a key factor in precipitating the crisis, and that reduction in imbalances is
the key to any future globally coordinated policy initiative to reestablish sustainable global
growth. This stands in contrast to analytical literature in economics which provides no
satisfactory measures either of the degree of either real or financial instability, either
individual national economies or in the combined global economy1, nor whether financial
instability is worsening or improving over time. Here we focus on the external sector
components of global imbalances, link these to expected worsening instability, and through
this linkage assess their potential contribution to the onset of the 2008 crisis.
Theoretical literature (such as Arrow and Hurwicz, 1958) of following Walras and his
tâtonnement price adjustment scheme has characterized both stable and unstable
adjustment processes, but remains silent on both the characterization and measurement of
the degree of instability; either financial or real. The post‐crisis literature which attempts to
fill this gap like Dattels et al (2010) which provides detailed discussion on the Global
Financial Stability Map developed by the IMF in Global Financial Stability Report (2007), and
adopts an ad hoc approach of compiling composite indices of economic performance over
time covering broad aggregates such as GDP change, inflation rates, employment change
and other aggregates, with the claim that this provides proxies for measures of financial
instability.
We focus here only on the external sector component of imbalances and
produce measures of expected worsening or improving external sector instability both for

But see the discussion by Irving Fisher of corridor of stability in Fisher (1933). This concept is also discussed in Tobin (1975)
and Dimand (2005).
‐3‐

individual economies and the global economy based on the sum of the absolute value of
external sector imbalances (the trade imbalance, or the current account imbalance) across
subsets of or all countries as a proportion of the combined GDP of countries. We develop
two broad types of indices based on different ways of linking imbalances to growth rates.
For each kind of index we also develop a number of variants which differ in whether we use
the trade balance or the current account balance as the basis for the index; whether we use
deviations for a country in its growth performance relative to a group or relative to its own
historical experience; and whether we use simple averages to form group averages or
weight the individual country index values by their GDP to form a group average.
We examine the behavior of such measures for all G20 countries, and various
subsets (G2, G8, G12 and G8+5) after the 1980s, and especially over the period 2004‐2007
before the 2008 financial crisis. We also examine the behavior of indices after the crisis. An
increasing measure under such indices is an indication of widening future external sector
excess demands over all countries as a group relative to gross world product; it is also taken
as an indication of potentially increasing severity of adjustment problems ahead and hence
an elevated probability of onset of financial crisis.
Our results reveal no clear pattern linking the perceiving changing severity of future
imbalances captured in such indices through differential country growth performance to the
onset of the 2008 financial crisis, either for individual economies or the global economy. We
find significant differences in results from using deviations in country growth rates from
group averages or from an individual country’s own historical growth path in linking
imbalances to growth when generating indicates of expected changing instability. Results
also vary according to which measure of excess demand is used. In addition, the choices of
the base date as a reference point for assessing whether financial instability is worsening or
weakening also makes a substantial difference. Results do not differ that much if trade
imbalances or current account imbalances is used, nor whether we weight individual
country indices or use simple arithmetic averages.
The implication we draw from our calculations is that links between external sector
instability and the onset of the 2008 Financial Crisis may be more tenuous than the G20 has
seemingly asserted in developing their policy responses to the crisis. Indeed, no such claims
‐4‐
‐

of linkage of this form emerged either in the 1930’s in response to the Great Depression or
following the Asian Financial Crisis in the 1990s. And economies such as Germany and
Australia in the 1990s operated with external sector imbalances of 2.6% and 3.2% of GDP
respectively and the UK pre World War I operated with a surplus around 8% of GDP, which is
in excess of what was observed globally in 2008, and seemingly with no financial instability
repercussions. These cautions regarding the G20 assertions of linkage seem borne out by
our calculations.
Our argument is against with many recent literatures. For instance, Bini Smaghi
assessed in 2008 that external imbalances are often a reflection, and even a prediction, of
internal imbalances, Obstfeld and Rogoff (2009) argues that global imbalances and the
financial crisis were “intimately connected” by discussing the macroeconomic indicators of
the US and country groups such as current account balance, prices, international reserves,
and etc.
There are assessments in other literatures seem exactly right to us, though none of
them reach this position by employing index approach. For instance, Whelan (2010)
examines the US current account deficit by distinguishing gross and net external assets of
the US and also argues that the net flows associated with current account deficits played a
minor role in determining the 2008 financial crisis and reducing global imbalances should be
of secondary importance in preventing the crises.

2. Indices of Worsening or Improving External Sector Financial Instability

A substantial recent literature now discusses linkage between global imbalances
and instability, but none provides explicit measures for assessing either the degree of or
changes in sign of linkage, nor provides clear measures of instability. Nelson and Perli (2005)
discuss a number of financial indicators that the Federal Reserve Board’s staff uses as aids in
the interpretation of the condition of a financial system. Berger et al. (2009) assess
“competition‐fragility” and“competition‐stability” by regressing measures of loan risk,
bank risk, and bank equity capital on measures of market power. Adrian and Shin (2010)
describe the changing nature of financial intermediation in the market‐based financial
system. Brown et al. (2010) use a data set that allows high‐frequency monitoring of
household liabilities, and find that the level of household debt, after a sustained period of
increase, began to decline in 2008.
There is also a literature that discusses the potential impacts of the financial crisis
on trade. Amiti and Weinstein (2009) examine whether deterioration in bank health can
help explain the large drops in exports relative to output in the 2008 crisis. Eaton et al. (2010)
use detailed international trade data and a general‐equilibrium trade model to show that a
shift in spending away from manufactures, particularly durables, may have accounted for
more than 80 percent of the drop in trade/GDP.
Here we differ from this literature by using measures of external sector imbalances
both for individual economies and groups of economies which we link to country or group
growth rates to yield indices of expected impacts on global (or country sub group) financial
instability. We focus initially on trade imbalances (exports ‐ imports) and then also discuss
current account balances. We do not discuss other imbalances, such as differences in
national saving rates, deficits as a % of GDP or debt/GDP ratios across countries.
For a country experiencing imbalanced international trade, either presenting
surplus or deficit, we first assume that the ratio of the absolute value of its trade balance to
its GDP indicates the state of its external position. We define RiT for country i ,

‐6‐
‐

RiT =

Trade Balancei

(i = 1, L , N )

GDPi

(i)

We then combine the individual country RiT across countries to form a group
indicator, eg. for the G20, or for some other group of countries such as G8. We calculate the
ratio RWT for the global economy (or a sub group of countries) as the summed absolute
value of trade imbalances of all group members and its GDP as summed GDP of all members.
The ratio for the G2 (China and the United States) in a given year is, for instance, the sum of
absolute values of trade imbalances of China and the US divided by the sum of China and the
US GDP in the corresponding year. The ratio for the G20 for a period is the summed absolute
values of G20’s trade balances in this period divided by sum of G20’s GDP in the same
period.
Similarly, the current account imbalance for any country can be related to GDP as:

RiC =

Current

Account

Balancei

GDPi

(i = 1, L , N )

(ii)

A number of measurement issues arise with trade and current account imbalance
data. Importantly, we use data on trade imbalances and current account imbalances from
national Balance of Payment (BOP) sources without reconciling statistical differences in
global trade data. Thus, present available data on international trade, both in goods and
service, show significant deviation between reporters and partner’s statistics (so called
mirror trade statistics). The deviations in data on bilateral trade in goods are especially
significant between both developed country pairs and developed and developing country
pairs, and paired trade statistics between China and US show large differences both on the
export and import sides.
Also, because of the differing forms that international agreements on trade in
goods and trade in services take in the GATT (1994) and the GATS there is an incompatibility
between measures of world trade in goods and services. Measures of goods trade reflecting
GATT (1994) are restricted to trade that crosses borders. However, service trade under GATS
mode 3 (commercial presence) includes both cross border delivery and foreign affiliate sales
within borders. Li and Whalley (2010) argue that foreign affiliate sales (FAS) should either be
‐7‐
‐

partially included in goods trade to achieve consistency across the separate sets of goods
and services trade data or alternatively removed from services trade data. Kregel (2008) also
argues that international imbalances recorded using traditional balance of payments
accounting presumes national vertically integrated production of exports. However, this
may not be the most appropriate method to measure imbalances when multinational
corporations operate global production chains that are geographically distributed across a
number of national boundaries and financed by global financial institutions.
We then relate the RiT and RiC to country’s GDP growth rates and develop
indices of expected worsening or improving external sector instability at a point in time by
linking imbalances to growth rates both for individual countries or groups of countries. Two
sets of indices are developed based on different views of what may or may not affect the
external sector imbalance for an economy in the future. Our first simple approach taken
imbalances as fixed in relative to GDP, so that only differentials in growth rates will change
imbalances in the future. Our second approach incorporates an assumed endogenous
adjustment process for external imbalances given exogenous expected country growth
rates.
We develop our simple index approach by assuming that the imbalances ratios ( RiT
or RiC ) are fixed, i.e., an economy’s external position relative to GDP is given. Thus for an
economy having a large imbalance ratio and high GDP growth rate, its trade or current
account balances would increase relative to the global imbalance situation as its growth
continues. This would cause the enlargement of external sector balances of its bilateral
partners, and it would contribute to worsen the future global imbalances, and hence also
worsen for the global external sector financial instability. But for an economy having a large
imbalance ratio and a low GDP growth rate, its external sector balance would proportionally
fall over time as its relatively low GDP growth continued, and this would improve global
external financial instability. Accordingly, an economy with small imbalance ratios would
improve global external instability if it experienced a high GDP growth rate and worsen
global external instability if it experienced a low GDP growth rate.

‐8‐
‐

Under this approach, for a given country in a given year, we assess country impacts
on future global external sector financial stability by assessing whether it has relative larger
or smaller trade imbalances than average across countries and relatively faster or slower
GDP growth rate. This allows us to construct an index of expected future change in financial
instability for individual countries as outlined in Table 1.
Table 1: Simple Approach to Construction of Country Indices for Worsening or Improving Expected
Financial Instability—Type I Index

For a country in a given Year, its index is:
Above Average Imbalance Ratio

Below Average Imbalance Ratio

Above Average GDP Growth Rate

+1

‐1

Below Average GDP Growth Rate

‐1

+1

Note: Group index is summed +1, ‐1 over members; Index for a period is summed +1, ‐1 indices
over time

Under this simple +1/‐1 index approach, the +1 indices represent an imbalance
expected to Increase proportionally in value and hence increase potential for added global
instability, while ‐1 indices represent countries experiencing deceasing relative imbalances
and hence expected to a contribute to improving global financial instability.
In assigning +1/‐1 indices to G20 countries, we use two alternatively ways of
calculating average benchmarks for comparison. One is an average indicator (trade
imbalances and GDP growth rates) across all G20 members in each year; Another is average
country indicators over the period 1980 to 2009. For any country in any given year, we
compare country trade imbalance and GDP growth rates with relevant average values in the
same year respectively, decide which quadrant of Table 1 this fits into, and assign
corresponding +1/‐1 indices for the country in the year. This use of average values across
G20 members as a benchmark we denote this as “Across Countries”. The other method uses
the average value for each country over the period 1980 to 2009, and we denote this as
“Through Time”.

‐9‐
‐

We then develop a second index approach by assuming that there is an
endogenous adjustment mechanism in economies imbalances given exogenous future
expected growth rates both domestically and in other economies. For this we assume that
any economy with a higher than average GDP growth rate would import proportionally
more than its exports would grow, and any economy with a lower GDP growth rate would
import proportionally less. Thus for an economy with a high GDP growth rate and a trade
surplus, it would import more to meet its growing domestic demands and reduce its trade
surplus over time. For country with a low GDP growth rate and a deficit, its domestic market
would demand relatively less imports, and it would achieve more balanced trade over time.
Under such assumptions a country is improving global external financial instability by
self‐adjustment and we assign ‐1 index for such country for the year.
An economy experiencing high GDP growth and a deficit in trade would import
more to support its strong domestic market demand, thus would worsen its trade
imbalances more over time. For country with low GDP growth and surplus, its sluggish
domestic demand (and low productivity) would cause relatively less imports and worsen its
external imbalance further. We assign a +1 index to countries in these situations in a given
year. This in turn, indicates that they are likely to worsen future global external instability
through a deterioration in their own situation.
Table 2: Endogenous Approach to Construction of Country Indices for Worsening or Improving
instability ‐‐‐ Type II Index

For a country in a given year, its index is:
Surplus

Deficit

Above Average Growth Rate

‐1

+1

Below Average Growth Rate

+1

‐1

Note: Group index is summed +1, ‐1 over members; Index for a period is summed +1, ‐1 indices
over time

For any given country in a given year, we can thus also differentiate its effect on
global stability by whether it has a surplus or deficit in its external sector accounts, and
‐ 10 ‐
‐

relatively faster or slower GDP growth rate. Table 2 outlines how we have constructed this
index for individual countries. Positive indices represent expected future worsening
instability and negative indices represent expected improving instability. Again we calculate
two set of indices by using alternative benchmarks of average growth rates “Across
Countries” and “Through Time”.
Though a country’s various +1/‐1 indices can be used to represent changes in a
country’s qualitative contribution to global external financial instability and hence the
direction of its contribution to global instability, they are not comparable across different
countries due to differences in country size. Weighting +1/‐1 indices by country GDP relative
to G20 total GDP, gives weighted indices which indicate both the direction and the size of
combined country contributions to global external financial instability. Either the +1/‐1
country indices or weighted indices can be aggregated over time to form aggregated global
or sub group indices for periods. The aggregation of indices across group members forms
the indices for a group.
We can also compute the +1/‐1 index linking country’s current account imbalance to
its GDP growth rates using current account imbalances instead of trade imbalances.
Following the same procedure, we can compute the +1/‐1 indices using either the first or
second approach; also using either the “Across Countries” or “Through Time” method;
either for individual countries or an aggregation of country groups; and either for a single
year or aggregation for time periods.
These procedures thus yield a number of closely related indices of expected
worsening or weakening external financial instability each linking imbalances measures to
country’s GDP growth performance. We can also develop further indices using piecewise
benchmarks for comparison or using trade balance to trade as measure of imbalance. We do

not report these in this paper as they merely multiply further the range of potential indices.
We argue later that for the indices we use that the pattern of linkage between imbalances
and the onset of the 2008 financial crisis is highly varied. Using additional indices would only
strengthen this position.

3. The Behavior of Country and Group Trade and Current Account Imbalances

We have calculated the imbalance ratios, RiT and RiC , discussed in the section
above based on both trade imbalances and on current account imbalances. These have also
been aggregated for all G20 members (plus Netherlands), for groups of G2, G8, G8+5, G121
(country with over 1 trillion GDP in 2007), for developed countries and for developing
countries in the G20. For reference, we have also calculated the imbalance measures for all
OECD countries.
Table 3 reports trade imbalance measures both for individual G20 countries and for
the country groups listed above between the 1960s and 2000s and also before and after the
2008 Financial Crisis. These data indicate that trade imbalances kept growing between the
1960s and 2000s, and there is an especially large rise in imbalances for all groups after 2000.
Also, generally countries and groups have larger imbalances in 2008 ‐ 2009 than before the
2000s.Their trade imbalances measures then fell after the 2008 crisis.
Imbalances for the G20 and for the OECD show the same trends over time and
there are no significant differences between them. However, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Indonesia,
Turkey, Spain, Netherlands, Germany, the United States all have large trade imbalance of
over 5.5% of GDP in 2007. Ratios for about two thirds of the G20 countries show a sharp rise
in the early 2000s, with the ratio for Argentina in the 2000s being 4.7 fold higher than in the
1990s. Also, ratios for Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, Russia,
and Brazil doubled in the 2000s compared to the 1990s. Imbalances fall in 2007 and 2008
after sharp increases in the early 2000s. Trade imbalances decreased in 2009, but all groups
were still operating with larger imbalances post crisis at around twice those of the 1980s
and 1990s.

The G12 is a group of 12 countries with over 1 trillion GDP in 2007. It includes United States, Japan, China, Germany,
United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain, Canada, Brazil, Russia and India. Mexico and Australia joined this “1 trillion club” in
2008 and dropped out in 2009.

Note: N/A indicates data on imbalance is unavailable. Russia, for example, only has data from 1994.
Its ratio between 1990 and 1999 is calculated using available data for years after 1994.

Among all groups, the imbalance ratios of the G2 (China and the US) show the
largest increase before 2007, from 0.9 in 1980 to 6.7 in 2006. The G2 had the smallest
imbalance measure among all groups in 1980 and became the second largest after 2000
‐ 13 ‐
‐

(next to the developing country group). This continued until 2009 with the largest drop in
imbalance ratio in 2009. The continuing growth in imbalance ratios for all groups before the
early 2000s results in an accumulation in global imbalances before the financial crisis, especially
for the G2. The pattern for current account imbalance ratios is the same as that for trade

imbalance ratios.
Trade and current account imbalance ratios between the 1980s and 2000 as well as
yearly before and after the 2008 Financial Crisis are reported in Table 4. Though in general
current account imbalance ratios are smaller, they show similar behavior to trade imbalance
ratios. Group wise imbalance ratios measured by the current account imbalance ratios
increased sharply after the early 2000s, decreased in 2007 and 2008, and dropped sharply in
2009. The major difference between these two imbalance ratios is that the current account
imbalance ratios for the G2 became the largest among all groups, outranking those of
developing countries. Also, the G2 shows the smallest difference between ratios for current
account imbalances and trade imbalances. Results for indices linked to growth rates using
the two different measures as the base for the construction of indices thus do not vary
significantly.

4. Is Instability Worsening or Improving?

We next relate external sector imbalances to country’s GDP growth by constructing
the indices described above which to assess linkage between expected changes in financial
instability and the onset of financial crisis. We construct indices for individual countries and
groups of G20 countries using the two index approaches. Under each approach we also
separately calculate indices based both on trade imbalances and current account imbalances.
We also use the two Across Countries or Through Time treatments respectively. For each
variant of each index, we also calculate relevant weighted indices by GDP share. For each
group, we calculate arithmetic average indices by aggregating group members’ unweighted
indices and weighted indices by aggregating along group members using GDP weights.
Table 5 reports indices for the G20 of worsening or improving instability based on
these different approaches and methods, and averaged growth rates and imbalance
measures for the G20 before and after the 2008 Financial Crisis. The averaged GDP growth
rates of the G20 increased before 2007 and decreased in 2008, and showed a significant
drop in 2009, behavior similar to that of the imbalances .
For the G20, for the 16 kinds of indices listed in Table 5, the different indices
behave differently and there is no consistent pattern among them. In every year there are
opposite algebraic signs. Also there is no similar behavior in indices in recent years, except
for the trade imbalances based indices under the first approach and using the Through Time
treatment. Irrespective of whether we use arithmetic average indices or weighted average
indices, they both are positive over 2004 and 2007 and negative in 2008. This suggests the
choice of index determines whether the analysis showing increasing potential of worsening
instability over 2004 and 2007 and improving instability in 2008. In 2009 the arithmetic
average one is positive while weighted one is negative. Under same index approach and the
same method of Though Time, indices based on current account imbalances also do not
show same behavior.
In general, the behavior of indices for G20 varies according to index approach,
imbalance measures, index methods, and even the way of aggregation. And no form of
‐ 15 ‐
‐

indices among the 16 forms of indice shows clear superiority in predicting the 2008 financial
crisis. Thus, we conclude that either it is misleading to use simple indices to predict financial
crises and the linkage between imbalances and the onset of financial crisis asserted by G20
maybe more tenuous than the G20 claim.

Next we investigate changes in indices for the G20 compared to 1 year before, 5
years before and 10 years before. Results are reported in Table 6. Changes in indices
compared to previous year no matter for unweighted or weighted indices, show large rises
‐ 16 ‐
‐

and falls, alternating with signs every year or two. For four kinds of indices based on
different methods, only the unweighted indices show consistently worsening in external
instability in 1995 and in 2009 compared to 1 year ago. Weighted indices all show worsening
in instability in 2005 and 2009 and improvement in 2007 compared to the previous year.
Further more, only indices based on the Type I approach and Through Time method show
continue worsening expected external instability year by year between 2004 and 2006 and
improving in 2008 than in 2007.
Comparing over 5 years changes in unweighted and weighted indices for the G20
based on four methods show different signs each year, except for all negative changes in
2008 and all positive changes in 1995 for unweighted indices and negative changes in 2008
for all weighted indices. These indices show expected external instability to be less in 2008
than in 2003. Weighted indices for G20 based on type I approach and Through Time method
show worse in external financial instability between 2001 and 2007 than 5 years earlier and
improvement in 2008 and 2009, while weighted indices based on our Type II approach and
Across Countries method show continue improved instability between 2000 and 2004
compared to 5 years ago.
Even comparing with 10 years earlier, indices do not reveal stronger evidence that
there is worse external financial instability in recent decades compared to earlier. No matter
whether unweighted or weighted indices for the G20 are used, changes compared to 10
years ago differ in sign for each year for four kinds of indices under different index
approaches and methods. The only exception with all positive changes is weighted indices in
2000 compared to 1990. Weighted indices based on our Type I approach and our Across
Country method show continued worsening in instability after 1995 compared to 10 years
ago. Also, for indices based on Type I approach and Through Time method, weighted and
unweighted indices all show worsened instability between 2004 and 2007 and improved
instability in 2009 compared to one decade ago.
Overall, therefore, changes in indices for the G20 based on different methods vary
sharply according to the base date used for comparison. The linkage between instability and
onset of financial crisis revealed by our indices is unclear.

As indices for the G20 based on our Type I approach and using the Through Time
method show little evidence of worsening instability before the onset of 2008 financial crisis,
‐ 18 ‐
‐

we investigate if there is similar evidence for indices for sub groups and individual countries
under the same index approach. Table 7 reports the unweighted indices for the G8, US,
Japan and China based on trade imbalances using the Type I index approach and the
Through Time method, as well as the changes in indices compared to 1 year, 5 years and 10
years ago. The reason for using the G8 and these three additional countries for these
calculations lies in their considerable GDP weights in the G20.
The Arithmetic Average +1/‐1 indices for G8 are all positive between 2000 and 2007
(except for zeros in 2000 and 2003) and this indicates that there are always more (at least
equal) numbers showing +1 indices than ‐1 indices in these years. The indices for G8
increase between 2003 and 2006, and decrease between 2007 and 2008. There are 4 out 8
members of G8 with +1 indices in 2003, 5 out of 8 in 2004 and 2007, 6 out of 8 members in
2005 and 2006, while only 3 members with +1 indices in 2008. This suggests potential
worsening external instability 2007 and improving afterwards. The US has four +1 indices
and six ‐1 indices during the 1990s, and continues +1 indices between 2004 and 2006 and ‐1
indices afterwards, which indicate an accumulating potential worsening instability before
the 2008 financial crisis. Japan shows three +1 indices in the 1990s and all +1 indices in the
2000s. In most years during the past two decades, Japan and China have opposite yearly
indices, indicating an offset of expected instability among countries.
Changes in indices comparing with previous year also show no coincidence pattern
among these four economies. There are seven years in the 2000s that the indices for the US show
no difference from previous years; No obvious evidence also appears that there is sharp worsening
in expected external financial instability for the for G8, the US, Japan and China year by year before
the 2008 financial crisis.

Comparing indices with 5 years before, the G8 worsens in instability between 2001
and 2006 compared to 5 years ago, the US shows no change during 2000‐2005 and
2007‐2008, and China shows no change after 2003. Changes in indices for Japan move up
and down every a few years. According to these indices, the US has the same expected
financial instability in 2007 and 2008 as 5 years ago and smaller instability in 2009 compared
to 5 years ago.

‐ 19 ‐
‐

If we compared indices for these economies to 10 years earlier, then the indices for
the G8 between 2002 and 2008 are larger than 10 years ago, and the gap increases in the
early 2000s and decreases after 2006. There is smaller expected financial instability for the
G8 in 2009 compared to 10 years ago. For the US, there is the same or larger expected
financial instability between 2002 and 2008 than 10 years ago, and smaller instability in
2009 than in 1999.

Table 8 reports weighted indices as well as changes in indices compared to the
previous year, 5 years ago and 10 years ago for the G8, the US, Japan and China based on
trade imbalances using our Type I index approach and the Through Time method. Indices for
the G8 and the US show similar signs in each year after 1980, except for in 1990. Also,
‐ 20 ‐
‐

indices for G8 and the US are closer in values in recent years, because of the domination of
the US in the G8 and there is only a small trade‐off between the US and other G8 members.
In another words, the external instability of the US dominants others’ in the G8. There is
improved expected external instability for the G8 and the US in the early 2000s and
worsened instability between 2004 and 2006. Instability improves again afterwards. During
1980 to 2009, the minimum value of indices for US is ‐0.42 in 1985 and maximum value of
indices is 0.37 in 1986. The absolute values of weighted indices for the US fluctuate between
[0.3, 0.38] after the mid 1980s and decreases slowly in recent decade. Also despite the signs
of indices, the absolute values of weighted indices for China increases over time, while
indices for Japan decreases over time. These show a changing pattern among countries in
influencing global instability.
Similar to unweighed indices, change in indices for these four economies shows no
consistent pattern compared to previous year. During the 2000s indices for the G8 and the
US change signs in 2001, 2004 and 2007, which causes significant changes in indices for
these years compared to previous years and small changes in other years. Compared to one
year earlier, China shows worsened expected external instability between 2005 and 2007
and improvement afterwards.
The G8 has continued worsened expected external instability between 2001 and
2008 and improvement in 2009 compared to 5 years ago. The peak in differences in indices
for the G8 appears in 2006, and a trough appears in 2009. In recent decade, indices for US
show a sharp rise in 2006 and a sharp down turn in 2009 compared to 5 years earlier, while
no significant changes in others years. Indices for Japan show big differences compared to 5
years earlier for most years, reflecting changes in signs and fluctuations in values.
Comparing indices for these four economies over 10 years earlier, a common
characteristic is that they all show worsened external instability in most years in the 2000s.
For the G8, its external position worsens between 2002 and 2008 and improves in 2009
compared to a decade earlier. The story for the US is similar to that for the G8. Compared to
10 years earlier, the expected external instability of China worsens between 2000 and 2003,
improves slightly in 2004 and 2005, and worsens before improving again after 2008.

5. Concluding Remarks

The Pittsburgh G20 meeting in September 2009 resulted in agreement on a
framework for strong, sustainable and balanced growth and this, in turn, has provided the
impetus for major effects to reduce global imbalances as a key element to a G20 strategy of
preventing future global financial crisis. But the analytical underpinnings both of what
financial instability (as opposed to economic instability in general) actually is, and how it is
linked to both imbalances and the onset of financial crisis are remaining opaque in research
literature.
A recent G20 finance ministers meeting has resulted in a commitment by G20
countries to produce five indicators of financial instability, one of which is based on trade
imbalances. Our discussion sets out how country measures of imbalance ratios can be
combined both across time and across countries to provide aggregate measures of one key
element in imbalances, namely external sector imbalances. The hope is that aggregate
measures of financial instability can then give some guide to global policy coordination
responses in advance of potential crises after the 2008 event.
What we do not do here is pass definitive judgment on the strength of the link
between imbalance and the onset of crisis but we do suggest that from our calculations that
the basis for such a link maybe more tenuous than the G20 seem to believe. If the 2008
crisis is viewed as largely a confluence of bubbles in housing markets, oil prices, commodity
prices, and speculative mortgage and other lending, then the construction of measures of
global or national financial instability and linking them to changes in imbalances may help to
give insights on the relative contribution of imbalances. In the 1930s there was no serious
suggestion at the time that imbalances were a key cause of the depression. Nor in the Asian
financial crisis of 1997/1998 were imbalances thought to be the key. Equally imbalances
larger than those experienced in 2008 prevailed without the onset of financial instability in
earlier periods such as the pre World War I global economy. Whether this was, however, the
case in 2008 remains as the issue.
