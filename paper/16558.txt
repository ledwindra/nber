Shareholder Democracy in Canada
Randall Morck
NBER Working Paper No. 16558
November 2010
JEL No. G23,G3,G38,K22,N22,P5
ABSTRACT
The federal government stands poised to exercise its constitutional right to regulate financial markets,
an area traditionally left to competing provincial securities commissions. The current state of securities
regulation renders impotent US-style takeover defences, such as poison pills and staggered boards,
but allows voting caps and pyramiding in their stead. Various federal securities regulation models
are weighted in light of the current state of their needed complementary institutions. One option, for
which Canada is relatively well prepared, is the British model of activist independent institutional
investors and mandatory takeover bids.

Introduction
Democracy matters. Political democracy lets voters remove politicians whose policies or ethics
displease them. Economists increasingly appreciate that shareholder democracy also matters.
Economies generate greater prosperity if small shareholders can remove top insiders corporate
whose policies or ethics displease them. Like political democracy, shareholder democracy works
differently in different countries, and shareholder democracy in Canada is remarkably stunted
compared to that in the United States and United Kingdom, despite a shared Common Law
heritage.
This democratic deficit matters. Millions of middle-class Canadian savers now shares.
Canadian workers have amassed huge pension funds since the 1970s, and these funds are now
major shareholders in great Canadian companies. As First Nations win large land rights
settlements, they too are becoming potential major players in the stock market. Shareholder
democracy could be a major tool for empowering not only workers and retirees but previously
marginalized elements of society and the whole of the middle class.
In theory, big business in Canada should be more democratic than ever, and more
democratic than American big business. Canadian institutional investors are huge and growing.
Workers‘ pension funds and middle-class investors should be voting CEOs in and out of office,
demanding explanations, and marching corporate auditors to and fro. Canadian courts and
regulators have emasculated the poison pills and staggered boards that limit American
shareholders‘ power over American corporate managers (Gompers, Ishii and Metrick 2003;
Bebchuk and Cohen 2005), so Canadian corporations should be more democratic than their
American cousins.

1

In practice, the typical big Canadian corporation is arguably less democratic than in the
past, and less democratic than its peers in both America and Great Britain. This is because
corporate insiders dominate the shareholder meetings of listed Canadian firms to an extent
generally not seen in either the United States or the United Kingdom, and because Canadian
legislatures, courts, regulators, and exchanges accept and passively perpetuate this.
Shareholder democracy, like political democracy, is not an end per se; but a means to
ensure good governance. If a benevolent dictator created a paradise on earth, citizens might
acquiesce to a dearth of plebiscites; and if dictatorial tycoons‘ corporations were unrivalled
creators of wealth, high-paying jobs, and tax revenues, a democratic deficit in their shareholder
meetings might be acceptable. But a large and growing body of evidence shows Canadian
corporations underperforming across the board.
This is no coincidence, for much empirical evidence links shareholder democracy to firm
and economy performance. Top corporate insiders who are more accountable to shareholders
appear to deliver better firm performance in the United States, across countries, and in Canada.
This chapter argues that Canada‘s lawmakers and courts seem little concerned about
shareholders meagre rights, but deeply worried that influential corporate insiders might object to
stronger oversight. With federal securities regulation on the horizon, reforms to enhance
shareholder democracy are feasible as ways to invigorate the economy – elevating shareholder
wealth, creating jobs, and fattening the government tax coffers that pay for social programs.

The Performance of Canada’s Corporate Sector
Despite escaping the worst effects of the 2007 financial panic, Canadian firms have a long track
record of underperformance relative to their American peers. A firm‘s performance can be

2

measured in many ways, and Canadian big business is remarkably consistent in underperforming
across alternative measures.
One set of metrics gauge firms‘ productivity: their ability to turn given amounts of inputs,
including labour and capital, into more economically valuable outputs. Economists favour this
measure because it accords with their notion of efficiency as avoiding waste. Using the country‘s
workforce and savings to produce fewer or shoddier goods and services than could be produced
is wasteful, and thus poor corporate performance.
Figure 1 summarizes Canadian firms‘ lagging productivity. Canadian firms need more
inputs – workers and physical capital – to produce the same output as their US rivals. The figure
shows a deficit against not just America, but against all other major industrialized countries too.
The deficit is clearly not a data fluke – it is evident across many different techniques for
measuring productivity (Baldwin, Gu and Yan 2008). It‘s not that American firms are unusually
productive: something is retarding Canadian firms.
Though ardent neoclassical economists might dissent, productivity is not always the best
performance gauge. Perhaps Canadian businesses are less productive, but excel in other ways?

Total factor productivity measures the increase in “value-added” by each country’s business sector over
and above the cost of its inputs. Higher productivity growth means a country’s businesses are making
higher value outputs, using lower value inputs, or both. Productivity is a central measure of the extent to
which a country’s business sector is contributes to overall economic prosperity. Data are available
through 2008 for all countries except for Australia, Japan, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the U.K,
whose data ends in 2007.. Source: www.oecd.org.

One alternative performance measure is shareholder value – how high the share price is
relative to what it might be under the best possible management. This metric seems as obvious to
financial analysts as productivity seems to neoclassical economists – shareholders own
businesses, this metric says businesses should be run to make shareholders rich.
Perhaps Canada‘s firms are less productive but create more wealth for their shareholders?
This too can be checked. Figure 2 summarizes a recent study contrasting the shareholder wealth
created by listed Canadian firms to that created by comparable listed American firms. It shows
that Canadian firms are markedly less effective at creating shareholder value.
But shareholder value creation, like productivity, might still not be the right metric. A
recent film entitled The Corporation, based on the book The Corporation: The Pathological
Pursuit of Profit and Power by Joel Bakan, and starring Elaine Bernard, Paul Weiler‘s colleague
at Harvard Law School‘s Labor and Worklife Program, delightfully pillories a narrow-minded
focus on shareholder value. The film holds that ethical judgment, not blind pursuit of profit or
wealth, should motivate those entrusted with the governance of a country‘s great corporations.
This conclusion is hard to argue with, but easy to argue about. Of course, corporations
should be run ethically, but what does that mean? The most outspoken advocates of ethical
behaviour in any country are often its most religious citizens, but no one would seriously
advocate turning Canada‘s great corporations over to priests or ministers, let alone televangelists.
An ethical metre-stick of corporate performance needs to be both easily readable and marked in a
way acceptable to the majority of citizens in a democracy. At present, we are in only the earliest
stages of building a better metre-stick.

Shareholder value is expressed relative to four commonly used benchmarks. Panel A presents mean ratios of
shareholder value over book value of assets. Panel B uses mean price-earnings ratios, estimated as calendar yearend share price over earnings during the previous 12 months. Panel C presents Tobin's average q ratios, estimated
as total assets plus market value of equity minus book value of equity, scaled by total assets. Panel D displays pricecash flow ratios, computed as the sum of long-term debt, debt in current liabilities, preferred stock and market value
of equity scaled by operating income before depreciation. In all cases, stock prices are at calendar year-end and
balance sheet items are at the most recent fiscal year-end. Source: King and Segal (2008).

Such a metre-stick ought perhaps to consider how well a firm serves its employees. This
too can be measured. Perhaps Canadian firms post lower productivity and generate less
shareholder wealth but pay their employees more. But Figure 3 shows Canadian per capita
income below that of the United States, and hovering at levels comparable with those of Britain.
Another possible metric is overall employment. Perhaps Canada‘s great corporations post
low productivity, generate little wealth for their shareholders, and pay their workers less, but
6

keep more workers on to limit unemployment. This too can be checked. But Panel B ofFigure 3
shows Canada‘s unemployment rate worse than in either the US or UK until the recent crisis.

Of course, these metrics too can be challenged. Shareholders also have jobs and earn
wages from their employer. Workers are also shareholders via their pension funds and savings.
Pension funds now account for a huge fraction of the total savings of the Canadian economy. In
fact, Figure 4 shows that workers‘ pension funds are actually larger in Canada than in the United
States or United Kingdom, relative to the size of the economy. Workers, like other shareholders,
may well see shareholder value maximization, constrained by the laws of Canada and the ethical
standards of Canadians, as a decreasingly radical idea. If anything, aging Canadian workers
ought to be increasingly concerned about pension fund portfolio values.

The list of possible performance metrics is endless, and almost anything is admissible.
For example, value-destroying firms may truly be extremely well run and entirely worth their
shareholders‘ quiet respect. Jesus teaches that ―love of money is the root of all evil,‖ and perhaps
Canadians appreciate the freedom from evil brought by low productivity, anaemic wealth
creation, low wages, and high unemployment. But such saintliness seems implausible in the land
of the Winnipeg General Strike.

It’s Nice to Be an Insider in Canada
In the 1980s, studies by Eckbo (1986; 1988) raised eyebrows by contrasting stock price
movements around corporate takeovers in Canada versus in the United States. The solid grey line
in Figure 5 epitomizes the well-known pattern in the United States (Westin, Mitchell, and
Mulherin 2004), tracing out how the target firm‘s share price moves relatively little until the
bidder makes a public announcement that a takeover is in the offing, whereupon the target firm‘s
stock price shoots up – often by 30 percent or more within minutes.
The economics behind this price increase are complicated, but in many cases boil down
to the acquirer firm‘s top mangers being expected to operate the target firm more efficiently, or
at least less inefficiently.1 Except in leveraged buyouts in the 1980s and 1990s, this efficiency
gain does not seem detrimental to workers – acquired firms do not fire workers or cut wages
relative to otherwise similar firms that remain independent (Shleifer and Summers 2000; Westin,
Mitchell, and Mulherin 2004). Overall, the empirical evidence shows that shareholders do better,
and workers no worse, if firms are more vulnerable to takeovers.

Mulherin (2004).

Upon the news that it may be a takeover target, a firm’s share price rises markedly. In the United States
this increase occurs in the minutes or hours immediately following the announcement. In Canada the
target price generally begins rising sooner. Source: Graphical summary of findings in Bris (2005); Eckbo
(1986; 1988); Jensen and Ruback (1983).

For our purposes, the key revelation is that the target firm‘s share price holds steady and
then shoots up once investors learn that a control change is in the works. This contrasts markedly
with the dotted black line that traces out a stylized Canadian corporate takeover. Here the target‘s
share price slowly levitates upward during the two to three months before the takeover is
announced and then moves relatively little when the plans are made public. Eckbo (1986, 1988)
interprets this as evidence of more energetic and lucrative insider trading in Canada.
Remarkably, a recent study (Bris 2005) shows little change in two decades. In fact, after
comparing statistically meaningful samples of takeovers on each of the world‘s active stock
exchanges, he reports that Canada permits the most lucrative insider trading in any developed
economy. American courts routinely prosecute top corporate insiders for trading on inside
10

information, and even jail the occasional home decorating guru like Martha Stewart. But Canada,
with insider trading laws that read much like those in the United States, did not see its first
genuine criminal conviction for insider trading until 2010.2
After I mentioned this anomaly in a seminar for senior Canadian business leaders, one
explained why it was good for the country. First, he clarified, if shareholders really didn‘t like it,
they could sanction the corporate insiders at the next shareholders meeting. Second, he
continued, since Canadian top corporate insiders make a bit extra on the side by trading in their
firm‘s stocks, they accept lower salaries. Neither point, unfortunately, can be tested. Canadian
top corporate executives, unlike their American peers, have not faced firm requirements to
disclose their insider trades until 2010, and still need not make public their individual
compensation packages.

Limits on Shareholder Democracy in Canada
Shareholder democracy in Canada is free of staggered boards – one of its major constraints in the
United States. Staggered boards let shareholders elect a third of the board to a three year term
each year, and have gained popularity with US corporate insiders seeking to limit the power of
outside shareholders. By forcing dissidents to wait two years to replace a majority of the board
and three years to replace it entirely, staggered boards effectively entrench insiders to an extent
sufficient to significantly depress shareholder value in the affected firms (Bebchuk and Cohen
2008).

2

See In The Matter of the Securities Act, R.S.O. 1990, C. S.5, As Amended v. Stanko Joseph Grmovsek and Gil I.
Cornblum, 2009). A mining company executive was previously convicted of insider trading as a lesser charge to
fraud and, upon appeal, sentenced to 6 months and fined C$1 M (In the Matter of the Securities Act R.S.O. 1990 c.
S 5, as amended v. Glenn Harvey Harper, 2004) in connection with a mining stock fraud, whose principal
perpetrators remain unknown (Sergeant 2006, p. 64).

11

In Canada, staggered boards are ineffective because federal and provincial corporations
laws let shareholders demand emergency meetings at any time, at which all directors can be
replaced; and these provisions trump any charter amendment to the contrary. This enhances the
power of shareholders against hired managers. However, if the managers please controlling
shareholders, outsider shareholders can be ignored in many cases. A far greater proportion of
major firms have controlling shareholders in Canada than in either the United States or United
Kingdom, so unhindered shareholder power to hire and fire the board might properly be
translated as unhindered power for the controlling shareholder to appoint the board.
This has implications for the Canadian economy because previous work shows that firms
with entrenched controlling shareholders underperform (Morck, Shleifer and Vishny 1988;
McConnell and Servaes 1990: Morck, Stangeland and Yeung 2000) and that economies in which
most large firms have controlling shareholders underperform (Morck and Yeung 2004; Morck,
Weinstein and Yeung 2005; Fogel 2007).
Shareholder value is especially compromised where the controlling shareholder
commands a dominant block of votes without actually owning a proportionate fraction of the
firm‘s shares (Smith and Amoako-Adu 1995; Gompers, Ishi and Metrick 2010). This happens in
two ways in Canada.
First, a number of Canadian firms have used so-called dual class shares (Amoako-Adu
and Smith 1995, 2001) to magnify insider shareholders‘ voting power until it eclipses that of
outsider shareholder.3 The firm sells one class of shares, usually called restricted voting shares,
to the general public. These shares might give their owners one vote per share at the firm‘s
shareholder meeting. The firm simultaneously provides its insiders with a different class of
3

Dual class shares also exist in the United States and elsewhere. However, they were prohibited on the New York
Stock Exchange for many decades, and so fell out of favour among firms desiring a ―blue chip‖ reputation. See
Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick (2010).

12

shares, usually called superior voting shares, which give their owners many votes per share. This
practice means that even if the majority of a company‘s shareholders dislike the company‘s top
insiders, they can lack the voting power to do anything about it. Insiders increasingly
disproportionate voting in dual class firms has attracted criticism, and pressure to unify their
equity into a single class (Smith and Amoako-Adu 2001).
Such a case played out in 2010, Ontario courts and regulators let Magna controlling
shareholder Frank Stronach cash in his superior voting shares at a 1,800% premium after 57%
shareholder vote to allow it, despite the vocal objections of pensions funds with stock in the firm.
The problem with a simple vote on such an issue is that, even if insiders cannot vote, they frame
the question: the issue was not to eliminate the insiders‘ superior voting rights or not, but to
eliminate them with a huge payment to the insiders or retain disproportionate insider control for
the foreseeable future. We cannot know how shareholders might have voted given a third
option, such as the removal of the insiders‘‘ superior voting rights at a premium set by a
disinterested third party.
Second, many Canadian firms without dual class shares still have controlling
shareholders, typically very wealthy and well-connected, old-moneyed families. These families
sometimes command an effective majority through direct ownership of a large voting block, but
often employ a practice called pyramiding, to enhance their voting power.
Figure 6 explains how pyramiding magnifies substantial fortunes into control over large
groups of seemingly distinct corporations that, together, are worth vastly more. A wealthy
individual or family controls enough stock to dominate the shareholder meeting of one listed
firm – that at the apex in the figure. This firm, in turn, controls equity blocks sufficient to
dominate the shareholder meetings of a second tier of listed firms. These, in turn, each hold

13

control blocks in listed firms in a third tier. As many tiers can be added as the apex firm‘s
controlling shareholder desires, and each additional tier exponentially increases the corporate
assets that shareholder controls. Pyramiding thus creates artificial controlling shareholders in
firms that are really primarily capitalized by outside shareholders such as pension funds and
small investors.
Pyramidal groups of this form are the structures that let small cliques of oligarchic
families control the economies of many countries in Latin America, Asia, and continental Europe
– especially Eastern Europe and Russia. This practice is essentially unknown in both the United
States and United Kingdom, but widespread in Canada and throughout Asia, Latin America, and
continental Europe (La Porta et al. 1998).

Public Shareholders

A family firm controls listed firms, each of which controls more listed firms, each of which control yet more
listed firms. Remaining shares in each firms are held by public investors.

The type of ultimate controlling shareholder, if one is present, in the 20 largest listed corporations in each country as
of 1996. Control is inferred from a 10 percent voting block. Ultimate “controlling shareholder” means the person at the
end of any chain of corporate controlling shareholders. The prevalence of controlling shareholder in Japan is probably
understated because the stakes of equity holders who act together are not aggregated. Figures for Germany include
proxy voting rights held by universal banks. Source: Baums (1996); La Porta et al. (1998).

Canada’s Place in the World
Figure 6 shows that controlling shareholders are far more predominant among large Canadian
firms than in either the United States or United Kingdom. Canada looks instead much like an
Asian, Latin American, or continental European country in terms of the concentration of
economic power evident.
Pyramiding is little known in the United States because the Depression era president
Franklin Delano Roosevelt ended the practice as part of his New Deal. In a series of tax reforms,
he applied double taxation to inter-corporate dividends. This made large pyramidal structures, in

15

which dividends flow from firm to firm to firm, radically tax-disadvantaged. He also provided
capital-gains tax incentives for firms either to absorb or spin off listed subsidiaries. To reinforce
these tax sticks and carrots, he also pushed through the Public Utilities Holding Companies Act,
which proscribed large pyramids from controlling firms in industries designated as ―public
utilities.‖ Finally, his Investment Companies Act of 1940 subjected firms whose assets are mainly
shares in other firms to the rules governing investment funds. The last was perhaps overkill,
because pyramiding had largely disappeared from the United States by the late 1930s.4 Still,
Roosevelt‘s attack on America‘s robber barons, as the apex firms‘ controlling shareholders were
then known, was politically popular – and was never reversed by subsequent administrations,
including those of Ronald Reagan and the two Bushes.
Pyramiding disappeared from the United Kingdom after that country‘s pension funds
successfully lobbied the London Stock Exchange to impose a takeover rule in 1968. That rule,
later codified, required any listed firms‘ controlling shareholders to own either less than 30
percent of a firm‘s shares or all of them.5 But Canada‘s Depression-era leaders showed no
interest in emulating Roosevelt‘s drive to democratize business; and Prime Minister Trudeau, in
power when the LSE rule came into effect, proposed no such thing for Canada.
Högfeldt (2005) argues that Sweden‘s left-leaning politicians embraced pyramiding
because it simplified ―business-government cooperation.‖ A Social Democrat prime minister
need only phone a few business family patriarchs to cement a deal with ―big business.‖ Perhaps
Trudeau reached a similar conclusion, or perhaps nationalists in his circle persuaded him that
entrusting the business sector to wealthy Canadian oligarchs was preferable to risking foreign
4

For a detailed history of this legislation and its impact on the shareholdings structures of American businesses, see
Morck (2005).

This sequence of reforms is outlined in Franks, Mayer, and Rossi. (2005). Note that widely disbursed ownership
was commonplace in Britain before this reform as well, though the reform clearly was intended to solidify
shareholder democracy by ensuring that listed firms remain widely held.

takeovers. Or, the increased government interventionism of the Trudeau era and subsequent
governments might have induced businesses to invest more in lobbying the government
(Sawatsky, 1987), and large business groups controlled be old-moneyed and well-connected
families might have been more effective lobbyers, and hence became favoured players. These
suggestions are speculative, and a real answer awaits further research.
Regardless, a remarkable upsurge in pyramiding corresponds roughly to Trudeau‘s
leadership of the Liberal Party. Figure 8 classifies Canada‘s 100 largest companies, ranked by
assets, according to who controls them, first decade by decade and then at five-year intervals,
through the twentieth century. The figure shows a steady drop in family-controlled pyramidal
groups until Trudeau assumed leadership of the Liberal Party and government, whereupon a
sudden resurgence occurs.6 This persists until the 1980s, when Trudeau relinquished power.

Ownership, Canadian Annual Financial Review, and Financial Post Corporate Securities and the Financial Post
cards data. For the first half of the century, control is constructed from family and corporate histories plus general

In Canada, other categories – pyramids with widely held firms at the apex and
freestanding family controlled firms – are relatively minor in terms of assets. However,
government and foreign controlled firms are major classes. Figure 9 therefore removes foreign
controlled firms and state-owned enterprises to better reveal the composition of the domestically
controlled private sector. The figure shows that, in terms of changes to this pattern, the twentieth
century might easily have been omitted. By its end, family-controlled pyramiding was roughly as
prevalent as at the century‘s beginning. A greater importance of concentrated economic power
relative to United States or United Kingdom is perhaps unsurprising, given Canada‘s tolerance of
dual class shares, controlling shareholders, and pyramiding, and even the occasional company
with a corporate charter that lets a controlling family appoint half the directors, veto shareholder
proposals, and the like. But the time pattern in the figures, however, is both surprising and
disturbing.
The turn of the 21st century brought an abatement in the prominence of large pyramidal
business groups. Several large new firms without dual class shares of tiers of listed subsidiaries
– Research in Motion, EnCana, and Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan. If this trend holds up,
Canadian corporate democracy may come nearer its potential. However, both dual class shares
and pyramiding persist; and nothing at present precludes their resurgence.
More democratic corporate governance holds promise because it correlates not just with
better firm performance (Gompers Ishii, and Metrick 2003; Bebchuk and Cohen 2008), but also
with better economy-level performance. Figure 10, from La Porta et al. (1999), uses the 20
largest listed companies in each major market economy worldwide to gauge the health of its
shareholder democracy as of 1996. The length of each bar is the mean voting stake of the
controlling shareholder. The lighter part of the bars is the controlling shareholder‘s mean actual

20

stock ownership. The larger the difference, or control wedge, the worse the state of shareholder
democracy. La Porta et al. (1997; 2000; 2002) find weak shareholder democracy, measured in
various ways, including that displayed in the figure, to correlate with stunted financial systems,
depressed shareholder value, and a dearth of start-up firms.
The figure shows shareholder democracy in Canada markedly weaker than in any other
Common Law country because of the pyramiding and dual class shares then prominent. While
Canada scores well on other metrics, such as the laws on the books giving shareholders legal
rights against managers (La Porta et al. 1997), this creates a strong circumstantial case that weak
shareholder democracy underlies Canada‘s long weakened economic performance.
In today‘s global economy, Canada must compete for the savings of Canadians and
foreigners alike. Countries whose stocks give investors a rawer deal lose savings to countries
whose stocks offer better terms. Labour versus capital conflicts are ebbing, as workers discover
the importance of shareholder wealth creation to their pension funds and their quality of life in
retirement.
Canada‘s economy survived the Panic of 2008 in better shape than many others,
including America, and this is most likely due to its relatively conservative stance on banking
deregulation (Ratnovski and Huang 2009).

It would be nice to credit improved corporate

governance across the board for this resilience, but this would be unwarranted. Figures 11 and 12
reveal relatively subdued trading activity and a relatively unimpressive total market
capitalization in comparison to the averages across common law countries; though Canada looks
good next to most Civil Code countries. .

The total length of each bar is the size of the average voting control block in the top 20 listed firms,
ranked by market capitalization, in each country. The light grey segment of each bar is the average actual
ownership stake of the controlling shareholder. The darker grey segment is the average control wedge:
the average excess of that shareholder’s voting power over his or her ownership stake, and is due either
to super-voting shares or pyramiding. Source: La Porta et al. (1999).

What Is a Liberal Democracy to Do?
Canada is now establishing a federal securities regulator. This long overdue application of
federal power may well foster a larger and more active financial system. But the social purpose
of the financial system is not to be large and active, but to allocate the nation‘s savings to the
highest value uses. This section lays out a spectrum of policy alternatives paths federal securities
regulation might follow, along with their likely costs and benefits to the economy.
Larger and more active stock markets correlate with faster and more sustained economic
growth (King and Levine (1993; Gompers and Lerner 1986, 2006; Levine 1997; Jovanovic and
Rousseau 2001, 2002, 2003) and others. Sophisticated financial systems appear to augment
economy growth primarily by letting new firms list and tap the nation‘s savings (Schumpeter,
1911; Djankov et al. 2002), not by catering to old firms‘ insiders (Fogel et al. 2008). Rajan and
Zingales (2003) go further, presenting evidence of entrenched elites in the mid 20th century
actively undermining local stock markets to block the rise of competitors and lock in a
favourable (to them) status quo. Indeed, they directly link stunted stock markets to cozy clubby
corporate governance and a dearth of dynamic start-ups.
A federal securities regulator will have to contend with a set of uniquely Canadian
problems: a long tradition of incestuous private-public partnership, a deep social democratic
vein, and an oddly leftist nationalism. (Nationalists lie to the right in most countries.) These
problems complicate economic regulation in general, but are likely to be especially salient to
federal securities regulation.
The incest problem is protected by institutional inertia. Corporate insiders have long
grown used to the idea that securities regulators exist to protect them from impertinent
shareholders. Provincial regulators traditionally courted the insiders of listed firms; presumably

25

fearing they might move their listings elsewhere. This misapprehends the link between large,
dynamic financial markets and economy prosperity, which is through the readier capitalization of
innovative new firms. A regulator that sought to please as yet unknown potential entrants, rather
than extant listed firms, would realign stock markets towards fuelling growth.
A federal regulator is in a position to make a new start, but will encounter entrenched
lobbies that press for a continuation of the traditional model. This is already evident in the
―compromises‖ that provincial securities regulation will continue in parallel with the new federal
system and that firms may choose their regulators. This will fail if it becomes a race to the
bottom, with each regulator outbidding the other in allowing worse insider excesses. However, it
could succeed if federal regulation becomes a stamp of blue chip quality. Firms that list under
federal regulation might then command valuation premiums by engendering greater shareholder
trust. But for such a stamp is to be meaningful, firms must not be able to switch regulators.
Shareholders will not pay more for federally regulated equity if insiders can opportunistically
switch to an accommodating provincial regulator and then legally loot their firms.
The second problem, Canada‘s social democratic bent, pervades politics, the civil service
and the courts. Social democracy is not per se a problem, for the modern welfare state has
delivered unprecedented human development (Morck and Yeung 2010). But well-intended
attempts to view capital markets through social democratic prisms can have unintended
consequences. A good example is the Canada Business Corporations Act, which provides an
oppression remedy that lets public shareholders pierce through chains of holding companies to
sue controlling shareholders. Although few such suits succeed, this is precisely the sort of rights
outside investors need in an economy dominated by controlling shareholders – in theory. In
practice, the country‘s social democratic tradition intervenes in the guise of the Supreme Court‘s

26

interpretation of this Act. In 2004, the Supreme Court ruled to ―accept as an accurate statement
of law that in determining whether they are acting with a view to the best interests of the
corporation it may be legitimate, given all the circumstances of a given case, for the board of.‖7
This sounds progressive and enlightened, but actually provides corporate insiders de facto
cover to advance their own interests at every turn, for virtually any decision advances someone‘s
interests. By opportunistically selecting an appropriate interest group for each decision, insiders
have free rein to do as they will. Subsequent rulings have not undone this, and remedial action by
regulators or lawmakers is overdue. Federal securities regulators will be well positioned to
correct this.
The government is charged with regulating labour, the environment, and so on. That is
why we have labour law, environmental law, and other legislation. These bodies of law ought to
provide directors to consider, inter alia, the interests of shareholders, employees, suppliers,
creditors, consumers, governments and the environment binding constraints on what corporate
insiders may and may not do. But to grant them freedom to harm labour as long as this benefits
the environment, or to harm shareholders as long as this benefits some other interest group,
subordinates public policy to a private elite of corporate officers, directors, and controlling
shareholders so as to undermine both social and shareholder democracy.
A third problem a federal securities regulator will confront is nationalism. This awoke in
2010, when the federal government, energetically prodded by the Premier of Saskatchewan,
blocked an Australian takeover bid for Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan. Potash neglected to
replace its poison pill with an enduringly effective takeover defence, such as a voting cap, and so
sought refuge in patriotism. While some politicians glowed in national colours, those of more

27

liberal economic persuasion were left red-faced. The episode‘s aftermath may well be an
antitakeover defence in federal securities regulations that prevents future such embarrassment.
The idea that some takeovers ought not to happen is hard to dispute (Morck et al. 1990),
and some sort of filter is easy to justify. However, an economically sensible filter – one that
passes governance-improving takeovers and blocks empire-building ones – is very hard to
design. The Potash system of case-by-case political lobbying to block takeovers on vague‖
national interest‖ grounds, is surely the worst of all options, for it subjects corporate officers and
directors‘ careers to political influence. Much empirical evidence links politicized corporate
governance to dramatically inefficient resource allocation (Faccio 2006; Faccio et al. 2006;
Krueger 1974; Haber 2000, 2002; Haber et al. 2003; Högfeldt 2005; Shleifer and Vishny 1999;
and many others).
Federal securities regulators will have to contend with all three of these Canadian
quandaries. This must be done with adept finesse if a more efficient financial system is to
emerge. A path must be found that accepts the political power of incumbent corporate insiders,
the proximity of a social democratic vein to the political mainstream, and the enduring strength
of nationalist rhetoric as cover for special interests.
One possible path is the American one. Federal securities regulators could permit
American takeover defences – poison pills, staggered boards, and antitakeover laws. These
would shelter corporate insiders from shareholder pressure in ways that cannot attract too much
criticism from the United States; while providing boards with weapons to stop foreign takeovers.
Some U.S. state anti-takeover laws even evoke the Supreme Court‘s stakeholder balancing act as
a legal defence corporate officers and directors may use to fend off shareholder lawsuits.

28

However, the American system is damned at home for leaving underperforming
corporate insiders in charge too long (Shleifer and Vishny 1997; Gompers et al. 2003; Bebchuk
and Cohen 2005). Such criticisms, bolstered by the failure of US financial institutions in the
Panic of 2008, discredit this model. Federal securities regulators would court instant reputational
damage by emulating it.
Another option is Western Europe, where pyramiding, dual class shares, and powerful
business families limit shareholder democracy. But this model too suffers from its history.
Sweden suffered a dramatic financial collapse in the early 1990s, and European productivity lags
that in the US too. Where the European system arguably works best, other mechanisms –
intrusive bankers, expansive labour laws, and interventionist bureaucrats – drastically limit
controlling shareholders‘ discretion (Botero et al. 2004; Roe 1996). Canada‘s banks are already
vulnerable to charges of oligopoly, and granting them the governance powers entrusted to
German banks (Fohlin 2005) is surely politically infeasible. Redrafting labour rights along
European lines would also run aground on provincial jurisdiction. State intervention in business
works better in some countries than others, and Canada historically falls among the others
(Arbour 1993; Borins and Brown 1986). Private public partnership is perhaps more synonymous
to corruption in Canadian English and French (Bliss 1986; Cameron 1995) because the sweeping
disclosure that holds Scandinavian government and business to account (Amore 2010; Campbell
2008, Holmen et al 2007; Thomsen and Rose 2004) would be unacceptable to Canadians. In
short, the European model is probably not viable for federal securities regulators because of the
absence of complementary institutions that check corporate insiders in the wealthier parts of
Europe.

29

The most dangerous path is a superficial emulation of Northern Europe without its checks
and balances, for this led Latin America to a tenaciously oligarchic capitalism punctuated by
brief episodes of populism.8 Extensive pyramiding entrusts the governance of the greater parts of
their large business sectors to mere handfuls of elite families, who are all but unaccountable
under pervasively weak labour laws, disclosure rules, and public sector corruption.

FIGURE 13

all listed firms in Chile belong to pyramidal groups, each controlled by a different wealthy family and

Figure 13 illustrates one of Latin America‘s most economically democratic economies,
that of Chile. Each numbered circle is a listed company, and the lines demarcate equity control
blocks. The figure shows most listed Chilean firms controlled by one of a handful of wealthy

30

families. In Ecuador, an extreme case even by the standards of that continent, one huge pyramid
entrusts the governance of virtually the entire big business sector to one family, the Naboa
dynasty.
Roosevelt attacked ―robber baron‖ in 1930s America by taxing and otherwise restyricting
pyramiding. William Lyon Mackenzie King, Canada‘s prime minister at the time, saw no great
problem with robber barons. Indeed, the Rockefellers endowed Harvard‘s Canada Program in his
name.
This form of capitalism, however, is the least successful at generating widespread
prosperity (Rajan and Zingales 2003). The concentration of power it promotes is associated with
corruption (Fogel 2006), and inherited corporate control is no formula for corporate success – in
Canada (Morck, Stangeland, and Yeung 2000; Smith and Amoako-Adu 1999) or elsewhere
(Fogel 2006; Bennedsen et al. 2007; Pérez-González 2006).9

Yet this system is often

enthusiastically favoured by capitalists and their heirs. Shareholder democracy, and other ways
of restraining robber barons, therefore matter because they prevent the capitalist class from
undermining capitalism (Rajan and Zingales 2003).
A final choice open to Canada‘s federal securities regulators is the British path.
Following 1930s America in taxing augmented corporate control and explicitly limiting
pyramiding in key industries would require legislation that would run up against powerful
special interests.10 But emulating Britain‘s 1960s reforms to its takeover rules might well be
within the powers of a national securities regulator 1960s.
9

Expressing a minority view, Khanna and Palepu (2000) argue that such concentrated economic power usefully
compensate for dysfunctional markets in developing economies; that is they are a ‗second best‘ solution necessitated
by a weak business environment. As evidence, they point out that firms controlled by more powerful business
families perform better in Chile and India. Morck and Yeung (2004) argue that this likely reflects political influence
rather than genuine value creation. Khanna and Palepu (2005) disagree.
10
Bailey (1982) shows that Canadian tax rules previously discouraged dual class shares. They could readily be
changed to do so again.

31

Given the rise of Canadian pension funds in Figure 5, and the role of British pension
funds in that country‘s 1960s reforms (Franks, Mayer, and Rossi. 2005), the British trajectory is
perhaps a better bet. Federally regulated firms might therefore be subjected to ―all or nothing‖
takeover regulation – acquirers must buy 100% or stay away. While diluted versions of this sort
of rule, such as the Ontario requirement that acquirers buying control blocks extend their offers
proportionately to public shareholders, merely encumber acquirers; the full blooded British
version is consistent with an active market for corporate control in the UK (Franks et al. 2005)
and with a genuine democratic accountability of corporate insiders (Faccio and Ameziane 2000;
Cheffins 2009).
A key issue here is the independence of pension funds‘ boards of trustees. In the US,
most pension funds are controlled by business corporations, and such effects are only associated
with public sector pension funds, whose trustees are more accountable to their beneficiaries
(Pound 1988, 1991; Gordon and Pound 1993). Corporate pension fund trustees are, in contrast,
appointed by corporate CEOs and subject to a different dynamic: one firms‘ pension fund may
support another‘s entrenched insiders in anticipation of a quid pro quo (Pound 1988). Most
British pension funds are trade based: they cover all workers in a given trade and are thus more
responsible to workers and less under the thumbs of corporate insiders (Faccio and Ameziane,
2000). Canadian pension funds are a mixture, and if the British model of shareholder democracy
is to prevail successfully, would have to be rendered more like British pension funds.
This route might also accommodate a takeover defence with fewer downsides than the
poison pills and staggered boards of the US or the entrenched business families of Europe and
Latin America. Canada‘s banks are currently protected from takeovers by voting caps, which
prevent any shareholder from acquiring more than a given fraction of their shares.

32

This

effectively immunizes firms from takeovers. However, voting caps need not protect managers
from shareholder democracy if institutional shareholders can coordinate voting to oust
underperforming CEOs, as they appear to do in the UK (Black and Coffee 1994).
Federal securities regulation might thus accommodate nationalists, and salve selfinterested corporate insiders too, by permitting voting caps as a takeover defence as long as
institutional investors were also empowered sufficiently. For example, if institutional investors
could readily nominate and campaign for opposition slates of directors, voting caps would lose
much of their force. Takeovers can go awry, but the threat of dismissal by a raider is too useful a
stick against slothful managers to be discarded. One option might be to let a potential raider
convene a shareholder meeting upon reaching the voting cap, whereat a majority of disinterested
shareholders could vote to repeal or maintain the cap.
This, or something akin to it, addresses the three pressures likely to sway federal
regulators: Social democracy is accommodated by empowering employees and retirees via
independent and democratic pension funds. A hat is tipped to nationalism by letting workers‘ and
retirees‘ representatives vet takeovers, including those by foreigners. The self-interest of
entrenched corporate insiders is salved with voting caps, but not so much as to wholly lose the
market discipline hostile takeovers provide. As in Britain, mandatory 100% bids once a certain
threshold – say 20% - is crossed could prevent pyramiding and the governance problems
associated with entrenched insiders running narrowly held firms. This would also continue the
trend towards less pyramiding and fewer dual class equity structures by leaving listed firms
widely held and fully subject to shareholder democracy. Were this course pursued, listed firms
would end up democratically governed and controlled firms would end up private.

33

Of course, pension funds themselves can be misgoverned, so enhanced democracy there
too might be considered. Many corporate pension funds are controlled by chief financial officers,
not employees; and are run as organs of the sponsoring corporation (Lakonishok et al. 1991;
1992). Many public sector pension funds are run by political appointees with their own agendas
(Romano 1993a). Clearly, real shareholder democracy would empower the ultimate owners of
the shares: workers and retirees. For shareholder democracy to capture the center ground of
Canadian politics, democratic accountability of institutional investor management to
beneficiaries would have to be part of the picture, though both extremes of the political spectrum
might equally dislike this.
Weiler (1990) argues persuasively that granting labour stronger rights is good for the
economy and the general welfare. His most cogent arguments support workers rights to organize
and a level playing field upon which organized labour and management negotiate. With labour
unions in decline, pension funds might provide another route to both sorts of labour
empowerment. Workers could organize by electing pension fund trustees, and influence major
economic decisions by commanding votes at genuinely democratic shareholder meetings.
Perhaps in the twenty-first century ―capital-labour dispute‖ will even come to mean a
shareholder meeting wherein investors and pension funds combine forces to dispute the policies
of top corporate insiders.
