    "abstract": "\n\nDefault contribution rates for 401(k) pension plans powerfully influence workers\u2019 choices. Potential causes include opt-out costs, procrastination, inattention, and psychological anchoring. We examine the welfare implications of defaults under each of these theories. We show how the optimal default, the magnitude of the welfare effects, and the degree of normative ambiguity depend on the behavioral model, the scope of the choice domain deemed welfare-relevant, the use of penalties for passive choice, and other 401(k) plan features. Depending on which theory and welfare perspective one adopts, virtually any default contribution rate may be optimal. Still, our analysis provides reasonably robust justifications for setting the default either at the highest contribution rate matched by the employer or \u2013 contrary to common wisdom \u2013 at zero. We also identify the types of empirical evidence needed to determine which case is applicable.\n\n",
