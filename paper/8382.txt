INTRODUCTION
The 1990s have seen a series of radical changes in the funding of social insurance

programs, including a movement away from federal entitlements and towards increasing
state and local responsibility for the maintenance of a social safety net and other public
spending. In 1997 the state of Florida sued the U.S. government in an effort to recover
funds for SSI and food stamp benefits for legal immigrants cut by the 1996 Welfare
Reform Act. The mayor of Dade county alleged that “the new federal law is likely to
cost Dade County $300 million a year” (Morgan, St. Petersburg Times, 1997). In nearby
Pinellas County officials want to ensure that the state of Florida picks up the tab (as most
other states do) for the children’s health insurance program to offset the more than
$800,000 the local agency has contributed in matching funds since 1996 (Krueger, St.
Petersburg Times, 2001). Localities face a related problem when federal funds for
ongoing programs such as increased police forces dry up. The $8.8 billion federal
Community Oriented Police Services program that funded 100,000 additional police
officers is expiring, and finding funds to maintain the expanded force puts a great strain
on local budgets (Ortega, Columbus Dispatch, 1997).
In order to understand the likely consequences of such a movement on the
distribution of public spending, it is necessary to understand how fiscal distress affects
state and local budgets. How will local jurisdictions react to budget shocks? Will they
cut back welfare spending or capital projects, or will they raise taxes? If taxes are raised,
on whom does the burden of those increases fall? Will housing prices change? Will this
affect mobility between localities? How will neighboring jurisdictions react? How long

1

do these changes persist? What are the implications of these changes for the well-being
of residents?
This research builds on several strands of the public economics literature,
including the effect of fiscal institutions on states’ ability to respond to shocks (see
Poterba, 1994, Hines and Thaler, 1995 and Rueben, 1998), the effect of one state’s
spending on the spending of neighboring states (see Case, Hines, and Rosen, 1993,
Besley and Case, 1995, Figlio, Van Kolpin, and Reid, 1999, and Baicker, 2000), and the
effect of selective migration and population composition on the public bundle (see
Poterba, 1997, Borjas and Hilton, 1996, Meyer, 1998, and Levine and Zimmerman,
1999). Together this research suggests that the shift in control of funds from the federal
government to the states and localities will have a profound effect on the landscape of
public spending.
When control of funds is shifted from the federal to the state or local level, fiscal
institutions and demographics may play a much larger role in the distribution of
resources, and externalities or spillovers between jurisdictions may create very different
regional equilibria. Therefore the effect of fiscal shocks and the ability of states and
localities to shift funds between categories will be of increasing importance in
determining the distribution of social spending both within and between jurisdictions. It
is unclear, however, whether or not the effects documented in this literature are peculiar
to state budgets or to fiscal shocks originating in welfare programs themselves. Will
shocks to other parts of the budget be accommodated by decreases in welfare spending
too? Are local budgets fundamentally different from state budgets? The next logical step
in this line of research is to examine other sources of fiscal distress at the local level.

2

This is important not just for understanding the implications of welfare reform, but for
understanding the interplay among all state and local spending categories and the effect
of other financial reforms. Other kinds of fiscal stress and stress at the local level may
produce different budget spillovers, both between budget categories and between
jurisdictions.
Trying capital crimes is an increasing source of fiscal distress for counties, and
the cost of paying for these very expensive convictions has fueled a public debate about
their effectiveness in deterring crime and on whom the burden of paying for them should
fall. The estimated cost of a death penalty case is over $2 million (Dieter, 1994).
Documenting the ultimate incidence of the cost of these trials would be a valuable
exercise in and of itself, but they also provide a particularly apt setting in which to study
the intra- and interjurisdictional effects of local fiscal distress. As shown below, capital
trials are unexpected (most counties, even in states with capital punishment provisions,
saw no such convictions between 1983 and 1997), they represent a significant expense to
the county relative to its budget, they are likely to be uncorrelated with prior spending
and revenue decisions, and they offer no localized change in services associated with
living in a particular county. This paper takes advantage of the shock these trials impose
to investigate these questions empirically. I explore this source of variation first to
determine which areas of local budgets absorb the shocks, the spillover effects of the
budget changes, and where the ultimate incidence of capital convictions lies.

The

optimal financial design for public programs depends crucially on how each jurisdiction
absorbs shocks and on how shocks affect the total bundle of resources available to
different sectors of the population.

3

II.

EMPIRICAL STRATEGY
In order to investigate the effects of fiscal distress on program spending we need

to identify some exogenous source of budgetary stress not generated within these
programs.

It is insufficient (and potentially misleading) merely to examine the

relationships between different categories of spending without abstracting from economic
and political conditions. In order to uncover causal relationships, rather than correlations,
it is necessary to find shocks to local budgets that are unexpected and uninfluenced by
things like local economic conditions. Capital crime trials provide just such a source of
financial stress.

Background on Capital Crime Trials
Trying capital murder cases can pose a significant financial burden on localities
(see Dieter, 1994, for a review).

An Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental

Relations report (1993, p. 24) notes that court systems in most states “receive less than a
third of their budgets from the state. In most systems, counties provide the remaining
funds.” Costs for seeing a case through to a death sentence are estimated at more than $2
million, with some estimates ranging as high as $7 million to execution (Burnett, 1999).
This is as much as 10 times more than life in prison, and most of these costs accrue at the
trial level, contrary to much public discourse about the cost of “endless appeals” (Dieter).
Since nine out of ten defendants in capital crime trials are indigent, counties must often
pay legal costs for both prosecution and defense (Moneyline, 1995). The median county
spent $12 million in 1997 while the tenth percentile spent $2 million. The distribution of

4

county spending is shown in Figure 1. In 1991 NJ spent $16 million to impose the death
penalty, and the next year the state laid off 500 police officers because they could not
afford to pay them (Dieter).
Counties in many states complain of the financial hardships the trials impose.
Jasper County, Texas claims to have already raised property taxes by 8 percent to pay for
the trial of the three men accused of killing James Byrd, and will have to delay new
computer purchases and construction (Burnett). One Texas county tried to raise taxes to
pay for a high-profile capital trial and the taxpayers revolted and voted for a tax rollback,
which forced the county commissioners to cut funding to fire and ambulance services in
the county, while another case caused a border dispute between counties trying to avoid
the cost of a particular trial (Dieter). Jasper County, Mississippi (no relation) spent three
times more on a capital trial in 1995 than it spent on its libraries, and, lacking even
parking meters to raise revenue, had to increase property and automobile taxes to raise
the funds (Moneyline). Dieter reports several more examples:
Sierra County CA’s D.A. says ‘If [we] didn’t have to pay . . . for murders
[we] would have an investigator and the sheriff would have a couple of
extra deputies and we could do some lasting good . . . The sewage system
at the courthouse is failing, a bridge collapsed, there’s no county library,
no county park . . .’ The county’s auditor said that if death penalty
expenses kept piling up, the county would soon be broke . . . another death
penalty case would likely require the county to lay off 10% of its police
and sheriff force. (p. 5)
Quitman County, the poorest in Mississippi . . . had to raise taxes and
borrow money to try [two cases]. [The county clerk says] ‘I’m thinking
we’ll become even poorer and I’m also thinking that a lot of people are
going to move out of the county because of the increased tax burden and
move over to other counties where the taxes are not quite as high.’
In Lincoln County, Georgia . . . the county commissioners refused to pay
the defense costs when the attorney won a new trial for a death row inmate
[and] were sent to jail. [The] chair of the County Commission explained:

5

“We’re a rural county of 7,500 people with a small tax base. We had to
raise taxes once already for this case when it was originally tried, and now
we are going to have to raise taxes again. It’s not fair.” (p. 6)
While these cases are quite expensive, contrary to the impression given by much
media coverage they are fairly uncommon. Over the period used in this analysis, 1983 to
1997, 80% of counties saw no such convictions. This seems like an insurable risk, and
we might expect some form of intergovernmental risk sharing. Indeed, several states
(such as Texas, Idaho, Wyoming, Washington, and Mississippi) are currently considering
legislation to offset local costs, but (perhaps because of lags in adapting to the increasing
financial burden) during the period of study few such reimbursements occurred.
This anecdotal evidence suggests that the effects of paying for these trials should
be discernable in county budgets. It also suggests that we pay particular attention to local
taxes, and to capital and police protection expenditures. By examining the effects of
paying for these extraordinary and often unexpected expenses on local finances, we may
gain valuable insight into the effects of exogenous increases in local expenditures and
taxes, as well as a better understanding of the incidence of this expensive policy.

Estimation Framework
A simple economic model would predict that the cost of a negative windfall
would be borne based on the marginal propensity to consume public goods and private
goods out of income. Given the low fraction of personal income devoted to county
budgets (less than 3 percent in this period), we would expect the bulk of the costs to be
borne by increased taxes, and potentially smoothed over time by borrowing. (See Hines
and Thaler, 1995, for evidence that many shocks tend to be absorbed disproportionately

6

within closely related budget categories, known as the “flypaper effect.”) I estimate the
effect of paying for a capital crime conviction on total revenues, total spending, and
spending on specific public goods.
Several different models are estimated here, but each includes county effects (αi),
time effects (βt), demographic and economic controls including population (Xit), and
some also include a state-specific time trend (statei* t).

The dependent variable is

spending on a particular category or tax revenue from a particular source, and the
independent variable of interest is the presence of a capital conviction.

spending it = α i + β t + X it γ + statei * tλ + δ capital convictionit + ε it

(1)

taxationit = α i + β t + X itγ + statei * tλ + δ capital convictionit + ε it

(2)

We might want to limit the analysis to counties with few of these trials (so that they are
least expected), to counties in states with the death penalty (using just counties in deathpenalty states, as opposed to all counties without a case, as controls), or to smaller
counties (who may have less of a cushion and potentially even higher variable costs). I
also present analysis using a log specification, but since we would like to put a dollar
price tag on the cost of capital convictions I begin with this model.

III.

DATA

County Budgets
County budget data comes from two sources.

The first is the Census of

Governments, conducted every 5 years by the Bureau of the Census, and the second is the

7

Annual Survey of Government Finances, conducted most years on a sample of county
governments. County government data is used, rather than aggregations of all subgovernments to the county-area level. There are several logistical difficulties involved in
using this data, some of which can be overcome and some of which cannot.
Disaggregation in the early years is limited, and in some years missing observations and
0 values are indistinguishable. The number of counties in the survey is around 2100 for
years before 1992 and 1500 in the years after.

Capital Convictions
The National Corrections Reporting Program surveys all inmates admitted to
correctional facilities and is available annually from 1983 to 1997.

It includes

information on the county and date of conviction as well as the severity of the sentence.
From this information I have compiled the number of prisoners admitted to prison under
sentence of death by county by year. Because the survey is limited to inmates, those
acquitted in capital trials will be omitted from the analysis. The source of variation I use
is therefore the presence of a capital conviction. While the survey has much detail on the
individual prisoners and their sentences, it has only sentencing dates, not the time span of
the trial itself. Capital trials can often take more than a year, so a prison admission in
year t may very well affect county budgets in year t-1. While we can use the data to help
inform us about the proper time horizon, this noise is likely only to bias results towards
zero.1

1

One possible concern with the use of capital trials as an exogenous shock is that a prosecutor may have
discretion over whether or not to charge a defendant with a capital crime, and that his or her decision may
be influenced by the financial circumstances of the jurisdiction. The anecdotal evidence cited above
suggests that this is not the case, and while this proposition is difficult to test, capital convictions do not
appear to be predictable with the observed local conditions. For example, a regression of the capital crime

8

Data is summarized in Table 1. As the first panel shows, there is a great deal of
variation between counties in the number of prisoners convicted of capital crimes. Over
the 18 years sampled, most counties (more than 80 percent) had no death penalty
convictions and more than 10 percent had exactly 1 year with a death penalty conviction
between 1983 and 1997. Thus, for the vast majority of counties these convictions are
rare occurrences. Of course, some large counties have several convictions each year.
While costs for frequent capital conviction counties may still be variable, they are bound
to be more anticipated. Furthermore, the (relatively fixed) cost is likely to be a bigger
shock to smaller counties, which have a smaller tax base and are less likely to have the
requisite personnel already on staff.

Even for relatively large counties (those over

75,000) these events are relatively rare: 53 percent had none, and 17 percent had only 1.
(Fortunately, from our perspective, they are still common enough to provide ample
observations for estimation: more than 1,300 county-years saw at least one capital
conviction.)
Covariates
County covariates are available from several sources. The County and City Data
Book, published annually by the Bureau of the Census, includes variables at the countyyear level such as median age, personal income, land area, population, unemployment,
and employment by sector (such as within government or construction).

Further

demographic breakdowns (such as population by race) are available only in the decennial
census years. The Statistical Abstract of the United States provides some useful state-

dummy on the county unemployment rate and the budget deficit or surplus explains only .0064 of the
variation in capital convictions.

level data. County-level crime rates come from the Department of Justice Uniform Crime
Reports.

IV.

RESULTS

Capital Convictions and Spending
Table 2 presents estimates of equation (1) above. Reported budget categories at
the county level are sufficiently heterogeneous and inconsistently aggregated that it is not
clear exactly where the expenditures associated with the trials would appear. I report
disaggregated categories and include judicial and corrections spending, but this category
is not always available and even when it is may not capture the entire financial burden.
The dependent variables in Table 2 are thus both total spending and judicial and
corrections spending. Capital convictions appear on the right-hand side as a dummy
variable indicating the presence of an admission in year t or year t+1.2 The presence of a
death penalty conviction has a significant effect on expenditures, coming through judicial
and corrections spending. The presence of such a conviction increases judicial and
corrections spending (and total spending) by more than $1.5 million, which is quite
consistent with outside estimates of the cost of a death penalty case. Controls in columns
(1) and (2) include population, state and year fixed effects, and state-specific time trends.
Other controls, such as the unemployment and crime rates, have insignificant coefficients
and do not change the results in the presence of fixed effects, so are omitted here.
Column (3) excludes the state-specific time trend. Column (4) includes only counties in
2

This functional form is suggested by the data, as described above. While including a series of leads and
lags forces the dropping of several years of data, the cumulative effect is the same as the coefficient
presented here, and the most significant years are t and t+1.

10

state-years with death penalty legislation in place, effectively excluding non-death
penalty states as controls. Each produces similar results: capital convictions impose a
significant burden on county budgets, consistent with previous estimates of their total
cost.
We might be concerned that we are not adequately controlling for population in
this specification. If population ought to appear in a non-linear form, and if population
(positively) affects both the probability of having a death penalty case and the amount a
county spends, then the coefficient on death penalty convictions might be biased up. In
this case, it might be more appropriate to examine per capita spending and cases:

ln (spending )it = α i + β t + δ (capital conviction )it + γ ln ( population )it + ε it

(4)

Table 3 estimates equation (4), with different categories of spending and revenues
as the dependent variable (and robust standard errors in parentheses). The top panel uses
all counties. Here, too, total expenditures and revenues increase significantly with the
presence of a capital conviction. The presence of a trial increases spending by 1.8
percent and revenues by 1.6 percent, while decreasing police and highway expenditures
by 3.3 percent. At the mean, this implies an increase in spending of $1.2 million and
increase in revenues of $1.1 million. Applying these elasticties to the total number of
convictions during this period implies an increase in county budgets of more than $1.6
billion between 1982 and 1997.
11

Columns (3) through (7) estimate equation 4 for several subcategories of
spending. While there is much more noise in the individual categories, judicial and
corrections spending increases significantly (although not as much as total spending or
revenues), while police and highway expenditures decrease significantly (about $275,000
together). Why would police protection and highways in particular face cuts? The fact
that this spending decreases is consistent with the stories told by local officials and the
anecdotal evidence above, and may be driven by the fact that these funds are either on
hand and more easily accessible (police) or more easily delayed (capital spending on
highways). Delaying capital projects is akin to borrowing against future revenues. There
may also be political factors driving these decisions – a reduction in services most visible
to taxpayer-consumers may be the best way to motivate future tax increases. These
decreases are only about 20% of the increase in total spending at the mean: the main way
in which the trials are financed is through increased revenues to offset the increase in
total expenditures.3
While previous research suggested that negative shocks to the welfare budgets of
states resulted in cutbacks in other welfare spending, that does not seem to be the case
here. Spending on welfare, hospitals, and the like may be difficult to adjust in the shortrun, because of more complex rules and legislation. This negative finding suggests that
welfare programs are most at risk when jurisdictions face increases in spending on
similar programs such as Medicaid.

3

This analysis does not incorporate the dynamics of the budget adjustment process. The analysis discussed
above suggests that the biggest impact of these trials is in the first two years and that spending then returns
to pre-trial levels, but a more sophisticated econometric approach is required to separate out noise in the
timing of the expense from a dynamic adjustment process. Unfortunately, adding additional leads or lags
of the death conviction variable reduces the number of years available, making a more dynamic analysis
difficult with the current limited time span.

12

The lower panel presents the same estimations with the sample of counties limited
to those with fewer than 100,000 residents and capital convictions in 2 or fewer years.
Results look quite similar. If anything, spending on police declines by more, which is
consistent with the idea that smaller counties have a smaller tax base and thus a limited
ability to accommodate the shock entirely by raising taxes. These events are at least as
binding on local budgets when the jurisdiction is small and the event less anticipated.
Thus, the observed local reaction to these shocks is consistent with the predictions
of the theory: taxes increase in the short run, offset in part by a delay in capital
expenditures. The next section examines the broader ripple effects of this shock to
revenues.

Spillovers Between Counties
The “cost” of obtaining a capital conviction may extend well beyond the
prosecuting county’s borders.

There are many reasons to think that one county’s

spending might influence another’s, such as tax competition and selective migration (see
Case, Hines, and Rosen, 1993, and Besley and Case, 1995). If one county raises its taxes
it may enable the voters of a neighboring county to raise taxes (and thereby expenditures)
without fear of high-income taxpayers moving out of the jurisdiction. Thus, estimating
the full budgetary implication of these trials requires an examination of spillovers to other
counties.
These spillovers are difficult to estimate, however, because an OLS regression of
one county’s spending on that of its neighbors could be biased by omitted controls for
local political and economic conditions, correlated mismeasurement, and the like. If

13

capital convictions significantly increase spending and tax rates, we can use this as an
exogenous source of variation to examine the jurisdictional spillover effects.
Table 4 presents both OLS estimates and IV estimates where neighboring
counties’ revenues are instrumented with the presence of neighbors’ capital convictions.
In this table a county’s “neighbor” is the population-weighted average of geographically
contiguous counties, but there are certainly there are other measure of “neighborliness”
that would be equally reasonable.

(Similar results are obtained when neighbors’

spending is used, instead of neighbors’ revenues.)
The OLS regressions in columns (1) and (3) suggest that a 10 percent increase in
neighbors’ revenues induces a 1.8 percent increase in both own spending and own
revenues. These results are slightly lower than most estimates of state-to-state spillovers
discussed above, but are consistent with the literature in general. The IV results are very
similar, with elasticities of .23 for taxes and .21 for revenues, and are measured quite
precisely. The inclusion of these terms does not substantially change the estimated
effects of a county’s own capital convictions.
From this analysis we learn that county spending and revenue decisions have
significant spillovers to neighboring jurisdictions, even when the potential endogeneity of
neighbors’ budget decisions is taken into account. It seems that a shock to one county’s
taxes, even in the absence of an accompanying increase in services, loosens a constraint
on taxes and spending in neighboring counties. The extent to which this change in
neighboring behavior is a “cost” of a capital conviction depends on the extent of other
inter-county externalities.

CONCLUSION
This project explores the effects of the large negative shock to county budgets

posed by the presence of a capital crime trial, first to understand the real incidence of
these capital conviction costs and second to analyze the effects of local fiscal distress on
the level and distribution of public spending and revenues. Analysis shows that counties
bear the large and unexpected burden of capital convictions in part by raising taxes and in
part by decreasing expenditures on police, and highway spending, while health and
welfare spending seem to be maintained.

The estimated increase in taxes and

expenditures is significant, amounting to more than $1.6 billion over a 15-year period.
This is true for large and small counties alike. These convictions have effects beyond
county borders, consistent with the literature on local spillovers and “yardstick
competition”:

using capital convictions as an instrument for neighboring counties’

spending and revenues shows the presence of significant inter-jurisdictional spillovers
(while abstracting from correlated economic conditions and the like). These results
imply that the implementation of state programs to help offset these costs would be
welfare enhancing.
This analysis suggests several interesting extensions. First, we could see which
factors, such as demographics, affect the ways in which counties respond to such shocks.
Second, the presence of a capital conviction could be an instrument for several
endogenous right-hand side variables of interest. For example, since the convictions
appear to affect taxes and police expenditures, they could serve as an instrument to
examine the effect of property taxes on inter-county mobility or the effect of policing on
crime.

As states and localities are given greater control over public funds, the
distribution of spending and the well-being of residents will increasingly depend on the
way states and localities accommodate shocks, their ability to shift funds between budget
categories, and on the spillover effects of shocks within and between jurisdictions. Only
through understanding the reactions of state and local governments to different fiscal
conditions can we gauge the effectiveness and equity of the local provision of important
safety net programs and infrastructure, both in terms of the distribution and the stability
of resources.
