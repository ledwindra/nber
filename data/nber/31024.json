    "abstract": "\n\nWe propose a simple monetary model to investigate the implications of international financial sanctions for the preeminence of the US dollar in the international financial system. We show how the anticipation of financial sanctions can reduce the US dollar convenience yield and the holdings of US dollar assets. We also evaluate the implications for welfare and show that they are generally detrimental for all countries.\n\n",
