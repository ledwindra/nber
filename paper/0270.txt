EXPLAINING MOVEMENTS IN COMPLETED
FERTILITY ACROSS COHORTS

Lawrence W. Kenny

Abstract

A life cycle model of fertility based on the quantity—quality
model of fertility successfully explains changes in completed fertility

in a period in which completed fertility first fell and then rose. This
model furthermore accurately predicts the timing and level of the subsequent

peak in completed fertility. Regressions based on Easterlin's relative
economic status theory of fertility are less successful in predicting
fertility over a fifteen year period than regressions based on the quantity—

quality model. Upon investigation, much of the increase in completed fertility
associated with the baby boom appears to be primarily attributable to
sporadic wage growth.

I}ITRODUCTION

Economists have just begun to develop models which explain cross sectional
differences in both the total number of children ever born to a woman over her
lifetime (which I shall define to be completed fertility) and the "quality" of

each child. The cross—sectional results derived from the testing of these
"quantity—quality" models have been used to explain the fall over time from
high fertility levels to low fertility levels; this decrease in fertility
has then been attributed to increases in the educational attainment of the

population and in the value of the motherts time. There has been some concern
that the cross sectional quantity—quality models would not be able to explain
the large increase in completed fertility associated with the "baby boom".

This paper will demonstrate that such a fear is unfounded. These models, with

-

some further development, explain temporal movements in completed fertility

in the United States quite well.

Perhaps the strongest test of a model's worth in a time series context
is how accurately the model is able to predict a peak or trough,. Regressions
based on the cross sectional quantity—quality models of fertility and estimated
over a period in which fertility first fell and then rose correctly predict
the timing and level of the subsequent peak in completed fertility and in

general successfully predict fertility over a fifteen year period. The principal alternative explanation of the baby boom is Easterlin's relative economic

status theory. Regressions which attempt to test Easterlin's theory predict
that completed fertility will peak at least five years before it actually
peaks and systematically predict fertility to be below its actual level.
Trial by predictive power therefore suggests that the quantity—quality models

—2—

1) do explain temporal movements in completed fertility and 2) offer a more
appropriate theory of fertility than Easterlin's relative economic status
model.

THEORETICAL STRUCTURE

Willis (1973), DeTray (1973), and

Becker

and Lewis (1973) have developed

important static economic models explaining completed fertility. Households
are postulated to have a well defined utility function with the number of

children, the "quality" of each child, and other goods as elements. Utility
is maximized against the household's time and income budget constraints and

against the household's production capabilities. The number of children
demanded then is a function of non—wage earnings, the husband's wage rate,
the wife's wage rate, the husband's efficiency in producing items entering
the preference function, the wife's efficiency in producing Items entering
the utility function, and

the

price of market goods.

This model will now be extended to allow maximization of utility in a

life cycle context. Households are postulated to have the following utility
function:

u(S1, S2, ...

, S,

Q1, Q2, ...

,

N1, N2 ... , Ne),

()

where S1 = non—child consumption level in period 1,
"quality" of each child In period I,

N1 = number of children in period i.
Market goods and household time are used to produce the commodities which enter

the utility function in equation (1). In each period for each household member,

—3—

the sum of the time spent working and in household production must be equal

to the total time available. Furthermore, the present value of the household's
expenditures on market goods must be less than or equal to the present value

of the household's income over the life cycle. The household maximizes the
utility function described in (1) subject to its production possibilities and

to the various time and goods budget constraints. Ignoring losses associated
infant mortality, completed fertility equals N, where N =

N

Nj+i for all

The total number of children demanded (N) will be a function of the

Note that I have not explicitly derived a demand function for the number
of children (N).

I have used the household production framework 4n a life

cycle context to generate some insight Into which variables should enter a demand

function for number of children. The life cycle context of this model Implies

—4—

that cohorts at different points in their life cycle will be affected differently
by and will therefore react differently to the same cyclical change (e.g.,
dN

dN
,

Whi

, j). Another prediction of this life cycle model is that a

Whi

cyclical change will have an impact on the completed fertility of many cohorts;
thus, long and short lags are introduced into the relationship between the
business cycle and the number of children ever born.
A demand function for births in life cycle period j (t,N. =

N.+1

—

N.)

could be similarly tlderived.U However, the static cross sectional models of
fertility developed by Willis (1973), DeTray (1973), and Becker and Lewis (1973)
are models of completed fertility and are most directly tested in a time series

context when measures of completed fertility are used. Changes in a birth rate
measure such as

reflect changes in the timing of births as well as changes

in completed fertility. It is therefore impossible to ascertain the impact of
cyclical changes on completed family size from a knowledge of the effect of

cyclical changes on birth rates-without additional information. Thus, one of
the contributions of this time series study is the explanation of differences in
completed fertility rather than of differences in birth rates.

Virtually every other study of time series fertility has attempted to

explain changes in birth rates. Becker (1960), Kirk (1960), and Silver (1965)
found that birth rates move procyclically. In contrast to the above studies,
which related birth rates to current income, Easterlin (1966, 1968, 1969, 1973)

argued that birth rates are also affected by parental consumption. "It seems
plausible to argue that the consumption levels experienced in the parents'

household served, among other things, to shape their current preferences [for

material goods]." (Easterlin 1966, p. 140). Ceteris paribus, an increase

U

—5—

in parents' consumption levels increases their children's relative preference
for material goods, leading to a reduction in the number of children demanded.
This theory, considered by some to be ad hoc, would certainly be more acceptable
if it were part of a more general and empirically verified theory of taste

formation. In his 1973 article, Easterlin presented some imagininative graphical
analysis supporting his theory in which he shoved that birth rates indeed increase

when current income relative to parental income increases. Wachter (1975) and
Lee (1977) have also found that "relative income" had a positive impact on birth
rates, while Butz and Ward (1977) did not find relative income measures to
affect birth rates consistently.

EMPIRICAL IMPLEMENTATION

Let us now turn to the data. The cumulative birth rate of U. S. women
47 years old as of January 1 in year t (N47) is used to measure completed

fertility. Between 1923 and 1956, N47 fell from 3.737 to 2.229. The baby boom

was associated with a large (more than one child) increase in completed fertility. By 1974, N47 had risen to 3.016, and in 1981, N47 is expected to peak
in the vicinity of 3.4 children.1
Several variables measure labor market opportunities

(Whj Wj) as they

vary over the life cycle. Separate time series on wages for men and women and
which span a significant period of time do not appear to exist. There does
exist, however, a time series on manufacturing wages. An increase in manufacturing wages will be associated with increases in both the husband's wage and the

wife's wage.2 Numerous income and substitution effects accompany these increases
and the net impact is unclear a priori. Cross sectional evidence suggests that

-J

—6-an increase in the female wage has a strong negative impact on fertility,
but the evidence on the effect of an increase in the male wage is ambiguous.

The effect of an increase in wages will vary systematically over

the life cycle. If capital markets have some imperfection, then younger
families, with fewer assets, will face a higher cost of borrowing money.
Thus, for younger households, there will be a larger income effect accompany—

ing a change in wages. If the observed income elasticity of demand for
numbers of children is postive, then the elasticity of numbers of children
with respect to early life cycle wages should be more positive than the
elasticity of numbers of children with respect to late life cycle wages.

This is reinforced by life cycle variation in substitution effects. An
unexpected increase in wages increases the relative price of having young
children and leads to substitution toward less time intensive activities in
the "current" period and toward consumption and childbearing in later periods.

The ability to postpone childbearing mitigates the increase in the cost of

having children associated with an increase in wages. As women approach
menopause, it becomes increasingly costly to postpone bearing children, and
consequently an increase in wages entails a greater increase in the relative
price of children.

Because of the limited number of observations in this time series
data, I have chosen to summarize the opportunities that cohorts face over

their adult life cycle in the following five—year age groupings: 20—24,

25—29, 30—34, 35—39, 40—44. Define WMto be the natural logarithm of the
total compensation per hour at work in 1957 dollars for production workers

in manufacturing. Now define WN21
•

to

be the average of the value of WN lagged

25 (= 47—22) years and of the value of WM lagged 23 (= 47—24) years. Thus

1)

—7—
WM21 is an average of the (log) manufacturing wages in the economy when

members of a cohort were 22 and 24 years old. WM22

is

defined to be the

47—27) years and of WM lagged 18 (= 47—29)

average of WM lagged 20 (

years. WM31 is defined to be the average of WM lagged 15 (= 47—32) years
and

of

WM lagged 13 (

47—34) years. WM32 is defined to be the average of

WM lagged 10 years and of WM lagged 8 years and WM41 is defined to be the
average of WM lagged 5 years and of Wil

lagged

3 years. Accordingly, WM22,

WM31, WN32, WN41 measure the manufacturing wages that occured when members
of a cohort were in their late twenties, early thirties, late thirties, and
early forties respectively.

An increase in the unemployment rate is hypothesized to be associated

with an increase in uncertainty.3 As uncettainty rises, the risk of default
increases, causing lenders to increase the cost of borrowing. Moreover, in
periods of great uncertainty, households increase their demand for liquid
funds and correspondingly reduce their demand for capital expenditure (such

as bearing children). Therefore, since childbearing is more expensive in
periods of high unemployment, an increase in the unemployment rate is predicted

to lead to a decrease in completed fertility. Using the same lag structure
that was used to formulate the manufacturing wage variables, UA21, UA22, UA31,
UA32, and UA41 have been formed from a Lebergott—BLS unemployment series that
incorporates Darby's (1976) revised unemployment data for the 1930's.
An increase in parental education is hypothesized to increase productivity in producing child quality more than productivity in producing numbers

of children; more educated parents are more efficient in passing on knowledge

and are perhaps more efficient in contraception. The resultant substitution
away from numbers of children (and toward child quality) is expected to be
strong enough to overcome the weak positive Income effect associated with the

—8—
increase in household productivity. Knowledge may be increased by increasing
the number of years spent in school or by increasing the intensity of learning

in each year. The mean years of schooling completed by persons 30—34 years
old, lagged 15 years, (E) measures the educational attainment of persons

currently 47 years old. Define TP to be the number of teachers and other
instructional staff in public elementary and secondary day schools per child

aged 5—17. An increase in TP may reflect either an increase in the fraction
of school age children who attend school or an increase in the quantity of

teacher inputs per child in school. Kenny (1977) found a significant negative
relationship between class size and cognitive achievement, ceteris paribus.
Therefore TP appears to be an appropriate measure of the intensity of

learning as well as of educational attainment. Now define TPGS to be the
average of TP lagged 41 (= 47—6) years and of TP lagged 39 (= 47—8) years.
Thus, TPGS measures the number of teachers per child of school age when

members of a cohort were in grade school. TPMS and TPHS similarly measure
the number of teachers per childwhen members of a cohort were in ''middle"

school and in high school, respectively. Define TPNS to be the average of
TP

lagged 37 (=

47—10) years and of TP lagged 35 (

TPHS to be the average of TP

( 47—16)

lagged 33 (=

47—14)

47—12) years, and define

years and of TP lagged 31

years.

Two sets of variables have been constructed to test Easterlin's

relative economic status hypothesis. As noted above, he postulates that
tastes are in part determined by the consumption levels experienced in the

parents' household. Accordingly, let CNSM equal the natural logarithm of
per capital real personal consumption expenditures. The variables CNSMGS,
cNSMMS, and CNSNHS have been created with lags identical to the lags of the
/

—9—
teachers per child variables. Furthermore, since Easterlin (1973) has also
used lagged unemployment rates to measure relative economic status, UAGS,
UAMS, and UAHS have been generated from the UA series with the same lags
as the teachers per child variables.

I have been unable to find adequate time series measuring either

non—wage income (v) or real interest rates (r1). It is extremely difficult
to obtain a good measure of non—wage income even from recent data. The
real interest rate, which equals the nominal interest rate less the expected
rate of inflation, is never measured with certainty; moreover, those series
on real interest rates which have been generated for the post—war era have
"found" there to be very little fluctuation in the real rate of Interest.
No variables measuring the relative price of certain purchased goods (<pi>)
are used in the regressions reported below.

EMPIRICAL RESULTS
Ordinary least squares regressions explaining variation in completed
fertility (N47) between 1923 and 1974 are reported in Table 1.

The educational

attainment and teachers per child variables are entered in regressions (1)

and (2), respectively. Mean educational attainment (E) is essentially a
linear function of time. There is, however, much more cyclical variation
in the number of teachers per child of school age (TP). It is thus not
surprising to find that there is no positive autocorrelation in regression
(2) and that no conclusion about the existence of positive autocorrelation

can be drawn in regression (1). The regressions fix the decline and subsequent
increase in completed fertility quite well; nearly 98 percent of the variance

is explained. The standard error of the estimate is approxImately .08 children.

Manufacturing wages have a significant impact on fertility.4
With few exceptions, the wage coefficients fall over the life cycle, as

predicted. For example, an increase in wages experienced when women were
in their late 20's (WM22) significantly increases fertility, while an
increase in wages experienced when women were in their late 30's (WM32)

significantly decreases fertility. The exceptions to the monotonic fall
in the wage coefficients occur at the beginning and end of the life cycle;
the significantly negative coefficients of WM41 are less negative than the
coefficients of WM32, and in regression (1), the positive coefficient of

WN22 is greater than the positive coefficient of WM21. The five wage
coefficients sum to —3.029 and .032 in regressions (1) and (2), respectively.
These figures imply that if wages were to increase from $1.00 over the
entire life cycle to approximately $2.70 over the entire life cycle, then
the number of children born to women aged 47 would either decrease by 3.029

or increase by .032. The three child decrease implied by the educational
attainment regression is improbably large. The small increase.associated
with the teachers per child regression seems reasonable.
The prediction that an increase in unemployment is associated with

a decrease in completed fertility receives little support. Unemployment
lagged to occur when women were in their early forties (UA41) is significantly
negative; UA21 and UA32 are each significantly negative in only one of the

first two regressions. However, unemployment lagged to occur when women
were in their early thirties (UA31) is significantly positive. In regression
(2), the summed unemployment coefficients imply that if the unemployment
rate were to increase from 6 percent over the entire life cycle to 7 percent
over the entire life cycle, then completed fertility would fall by .037.

In

regression (1), a similar increase in the unemployment rate leads to

a .001 increase in N47.

5

Au increase in education is prediced to be associated with a
biased increase in household productivity which leads to a decrease in the

cumulative birth rate. The incorrect and significant positive sign of
mean years of completed schooling (E) in regression (1) probably reflects
the fact that there is very little cyclical variation in E and that E is

thus almost a trend variable. In regression (2) an increase in the number
of teachers per child of school age when women were in "middle" school (TPNS)

significantly decreases fertility. The TPGS, TPMS, and TPHS coefficients
sum to —41.248. Thus, the approximately .02 increase in TP between 1900 and
1970 is estimated to lead to a .8 fall in completed fertility.

In regressions (3) and (4), variables testing Easterlin's relative
economic status hypothesis replace the education variables found in regressions

(1) and (2). The "Easterlin" regressions have slightly greater explanatory
power than the quantity—quality regressions just discussed. The hypothesis
that there is positive autocorrelation is rejected in the per capita
consumption expenditures regression (regression (3)) but not in the unemployment regression (regression (4)).

The wage and unemployment coefficients in regression (3) are similar
in sign and significance to the wage and unemployment coefficients of

regression (1). The sum of the wage coefficients in the consumption expenditure regression (1.211) suggests that an increase in wages leads to a large

increase in completed fertility. This implausible prediction casts considerable
doubt on the usefulness of this regression. The significant negative coefficients
of cNSMGS, CNSMMS, and CNSNHS are consistent with Easterlin's hypothesis that,

U

— 13 —

holding

adult income constant, an increase in the consumption levels

experienced in the parents' household increases relative preferences for

material goods. However, completed fertility is too responsive to childhood consumption measures, for an increase in childhood real per capita
consumption expenditures from $1000 to approximately $2700 is estimated
to reduce N47 by 2.742.6

The results of the fourth regression are quite different from

the results of the first three. For the first time, WM31 is significantly
positive. WM41 is significantly negative, and the remaining wage variables
are insignificant. Two adult unemployment variables (UA31, UA32) have a
significantly positive impact on fertility, while only one adult unemployment
variable (UA21) has a significantly negative impact on N47; the sum of the
UA21, UA22, UA31, UA32, and IJA41 coefficients (.007) is incorrectly positive.
—

As Easterlin predicts, an increase in unemployment when children are growing
up, ceteris paribus, increases completed fertility; UAGS and UANS are
significant and positive.

PREDICTION
Can

a

regression which is based on a period in which fertility

first fell and then rose correctly predict the level and timing of the peak
in completed fertility and furthermore accurately predict how rapidly fertility

will subsequently decline? The regressions of Table 1 will now be put to
this strong test.
The cumulative birth rates of younger women can be used to "extendt'

the series on the cumulative birth rate of women aged 47 (N47). In one
regression, N47 was estimated as a function of a constant, the year (e.g., 1971),

—14-and

the

cumulative birth rate of women aged 42, lagged 5 years (

42).

In

two other regressions, N42 was replaced with the cumulative birth rate
of women aged 37, lagged 10 years (N37) and with the cumulative birth rate

of women aged 32, lagged 15 years (N32). In all three regressions, the
Cochrane—Orcutt technique has been used to remove serial correlation. The
standard errors of the estimate in these regressions were .002, .007, and

.018, respectively. Using these regressions, N47 has been predicted for
the years 1975—1989. These predictions (called "actual" values henceforth
for simplicity) are plotted in Figure 1. N47 is predicted to peak in
1980 or 1981 at 3.29 or 3.46; the former value, generated from more recent
fertility data, is a more reliable estimate.

We do not know what the wage rate and the unemployment rate will

be in the future. Thus, to use regressions such as those found in Table 1
to predict N47 past 1979, either future values of the wage rate and the
unemployment rate must be predicted, or late life cycle wage and unemployment
variables (e.g., UA4l, W1I4l) must be deleted from the regressions. Since
deleting late life cycle variables increases the incidence of positive auto—

correlation, I have chosen to predict the future course of UA and WM. The
unemployment rate is assumed to be 7.0 percent in 1977, 6.5 percent in 1978,

and the "natural rate" 6.1 percent in 1979 and subsequent years.7 Predicted
values for WM come from a regression in which WM is estimated as a function
of a constant, the year, and the growth in the U.S. population lagged 20

years.8 The population growth variable attempts to capture the depressing
effect of a large cohort on wages.

Let us now turn to the predictions of completed fertility. Predicted
values of N47 for the years 1975—1998 which have been generated from

regressions (2), (3) and (4) in Table 1 are shown in Figure 1. The teachers

per child regression (regression (2)) predicts that N47 will peak in 1981 at

3372 and fall to 2.266 in 1998. This regression forecasts accurately when
completed fertility will begin to decline and closely follows the path of

"actual" fertility. In contrast, the predictions from "Easterlin" regressions
(3) and (4) peak too soon (1975 and 1973, respectively) and are well below
"actual" values. In 1998, regressions (3) and (4) predict N47 to be 1.783
and 2.138, respectively.

The statistics found in Table 2 formally compare the "actual" and

predicted values of N47. In the years 1975—1984, "actual" values obtained
from N37 are compared with predicted values. In the period 1975—1989, "actual"
values obtained from N32 are compared with predicted values. Statistics on the
partial correlation coefficient between "actual" and predicted values, the root—
mean squared error of the prediction, the fraction of error due to bias, the
fraction of error due to the regression coefficient of actual on predicted values
being different from one, and the fraction of error due to residual variance are

presented. When compared to the forecasts from the "Easterlin" regressions, the
forecasts from the quantity—quality regressions (regressions (1) and (2)) 1) are
more correlated with "actual" values, 2) have smaller errors of prediction, 3) are
less biased, and 4) have a smaller fraction of the non—bias error attributable to
the regression coefficient being different from unity (i.e., actual values not

increasing by one when predicted values increase by one). Thus, the quantity—
quality predictions are uniformly preferred to the "Easterlin" predictions.

The ability of the quantity—quality regressions to predict fertility
in the 1975—1989 period is not limited by the choice of educational measures.

be the natural logarithm of current educational expenditures on public

primary and secondary education per child aged 5—17 divided by the average

annual salary of instructional staff. From Table 2, it can be seen that
regressions using DYGS, DYMS, afid DYIIS or CXTGS, CXTNS, and CXTHS have

many of the desirable properties of prediction found in regressions (1) and (2).
Finally, let us compare our forecasts with those prepared by the

Bureau of the Census (1975). The Bureau of the Census projections, plotted
in Figure 1 are based on the birth expectations of young women. For three
of the five comparison years, the Bureau of the Census forecasts fall
between the quantity—quality forecasts and the Easterlin forecasts, and
over the five comparison years, the predictions from the teachers per child
regression are on average .2 children greater than the cumulative birth
rates forecast by the Bureau of the Census.

EXPLANATION OF BABY BOOM
It is now possible to investigate the cause of the increase in

completed fertility associated with the "baby boom." In Table 3, the
coefficients of the teachers per child of school age regression have been
multiplied by the change in the independent variable values over a specified
period to generate a change in the predicted value of N47 over that period

attributable to changes in each of the independent variables. For example,
3.015 has been multiplied by the difference between WM21

In

in

1936 and WM21

1926 to yield .427 in the upper left hand corner of Table 3.

Wage effects predict that N47 will fall by .339 per decade between
1926 and 1956, rise by .534 per decade between .956 and 1981, and finally

fall by .557 per decade between 1981 and 1998. Approximately 98 percent
of the change in the rate of growth of fertility between the decline and

boom and between the boom and subsequent decline is accounted for by changes

in wages. Between 1956 and 1981, early life cycle wages (WN21 and WN22)
grew unusually rapidly and late life cycle wages (WM32 and WM41) grew

unusually slowly. That is, relative to the cohort born in 1909, members
of the cohort born in 1934 experienced much higher wages when they were
in their twenties and only slightly higher wages when they were in their

late thirties and early forties. An increase in early life cycle wages
and a decrease in late life wages both increase cumulative birth rates.
Thus,. this asymmetric growth in wages led to an increase in completed

fertility. Correspondingly, slow growth in early life cycle wages and
rapid growth in late life cycle wages are predicted to make the post—baby
boom decline in fertility more rapid than the pre—baby boom decline in
fertility.

The unemployment variables surprisingly mitigate some of the

wage effects. Unemployment effects lead to either a small increase or a
negligible change in fertility in the years in which completed fertility
is declining and lead to a small decrease in completed fertility in the

boom years between 1956 and 1981. Changes in UA21 reinforce the effects
of wage changes, while changes in UA22 and in UA41 reduce the impact of
wage changes.

Approximately 7 percent of the change in the rate of growth of
completed fertility is due to fluctuations in the rate of growth of the

number of teachers per child of school age. The "baby boom" cohorts were
in "middle" school roughly between 1920 and 1945. This was a period in
which there was sluggish growth in the number of teachers per child, and
that sluggish growth contributed to the increase in family size associated
with the baby boom.

CONCLUSION

The life cycle versions of the quantity—quality model and of the
Easterlin model both successfully explain the fall and increase in completed

fertility between 1923 and 1974. However, the coefficients from the Easterlin
regressions are perhaps somewhat less plausible than the coefficients from

the quantity—quality regressions. The success or failure of a model in
predicting future behavior is a critical test of its worth, and predicting

a change in trend is one particularly strong test of a model's merit. The
quantity—quality regressions accurately predict the timing and level of the
peak in completed fertility and closely follow the path of completed
fertility over a fifteen year period that includes the last years of the
baby boom and the first few years of the subsequent decline in completed

fertility. By any measure, the Easterlin regressions are less successful
in predicting fertility in this period; these regressions predict that
fertility will peak well before it actually peaks and that fertility will

be less than it actually is. The evidence thus supports the hypothesis that
the quantity—quality model is a better model of fertility behavior than the
Easterlin model.

Much of the increase in completed fertility associated with the
baby boom appears to be attributable to the sporadic growth in real wages

over time. Therefore, the alternation of protracted periods of rapid wage
growth with protracted periods of sluggish wage growth in the future would

once again lead to booms and busts in completed fertility. A small part
of the baby boom is due to the sluggish growth of schooling inputs. Education
is nevertheless an important explanation of time series movements in
completed fertility, for the only difference between the accurate predictions

— 22 —

of

the quantity—quality regressions and the inaccurate predictions of the

Easterlin regressions is the choice of the childhood variables which are used
In these regressions.

Much more work remains to be done. The time series specification
in this paper could be further tested using data from any of a number of

other countries that experienced the baby boom. Cross sectional panel
studies or retrospective studies provide yet another data source for
ascertaining whether the findings of this paper can be replicated.

2. Note that an increase in the manufacturing wage may be associated more
with, an increase in the husband's wage than with an increase in the
wife's wage.

3. A change in the unemployment rate may also be associated with a change
in the value placed upon the wife's time. The "added worker—discouraged
worker" controversy in the female labor force participation literature
is relevant.

4. An alternative measure of wages, a weighted average of manufacturing
and farm wages, did not have a consistent impact on completed fertility
and was associated with a greater incidence of autocorrelation than is
found in Table 1.

5. Although regressions which id not incorporate Darby's adjustments to
the unemployment variables had somewhat greater explanatory power than
the regressions in Table 1, the former regressions had a greater incidence
of autocorrelation and were less successful in predicting future fertility
than the regressions in Table 1.
