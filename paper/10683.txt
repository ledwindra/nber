Inequality Change in China and (Hukou) Labour Mobility Restrictions
John Whalley and Shunming Zhang
NBER Working Paper No. 10683
August 2004
JEL No. J61, R23, F00
ABSTRACT
We analyze the Hukou system of permanent registration in China which many believe has supported
growing relative inequality over the last 20 years by restraining labour migration both between the
countryside and urban areas and between regions and cities. Our aim is to inject economic modelling
into the debate on sources of inequality in China which thus far has been largely statistical. We first
use a model with homogeneous labour in which wage inequality across various geographical divides
in China is supported solely by quantity based migration restrictions (urban -- rural areas, rich -poor regions, eastern coastal -- central and western (noncoastal) zones, eastern and central -- western
development zones, eastern -- central -- western zones, more disaggregated 6 regional
classifications, and an all 31 provincal classification). We calibrate this model to base case data and
when we remove migration restrictions all wage and most income inequality disappears. Results
from this model structure point to a significant role for Hukou restrictions in supporting inequality
in China, and show how economic rather than statistical modelling can be used to decompose
inequality change. We then modify the model to capture labour efficiency differences across regions,
calibrating the modified model to estimates of both national and regional Gini coefficients. Removal
of migration barriers is again inequality improving but now less so. Finally, we present a further
model extension in which urban house price rises retard rural - urban migration. The impacts of
removing of migration restrictions on inequality are smaller, but are still significant.

INTRODUCTION

The statistical literature on inequality in China (Bramall and Jones (1993), Chen (1996), Hare and West
(1999), Jalan and Ravallion (1998), Kanbur and Zhang (1999), Lyons (1991), Rozelle (1994), and Tsui (1991,
1993, 1996, 1998, 1998)) is widely interpreted as pointing to growing national relative inequality in recent
years. According to received wisdom based on some of this literature, the national Gini coefficient from China
on income inequality has increased to around 0.4 from 0.3 over the last 10 years.

2

This change coexists

with more slowly growing inequality within the urban and rural segments of the economy (as measured by
Gini coefficients), and also within coastal zones and inland segments of the economy. A sharp increase in the
income / capita gap across these divides is usually taken to account for increased national relative inequality.
Absolute poverty as measured by head count ratios and other measures consistently falls in Chinese data
reflecting strong GDP growth in recent years. Numerous attempts have been made to account for this
inequality change profile using statistical techniques as in the literature listed above. Our aim here is to
use economic modelling to provide fresh decompositional insights as to how much of the recent growth in
inequality in China is due to which factors.
We focus on the system of Hukou in China, or registered permanent residence, which is location specific.
Not having Hukou in urban areas means that migrants receive no education or health benefits and cannot
purchase housing, since title to it cannot be registered by them. Effectively, Hukou operates as a barrier to
urban / rural migration in China and supports large regional wage differentials which labour markets do not
compete away. We ask how much inequality there would have been in China without the Hukou system, and
consciously try to introduce results from the application of numerical modelling techniques into a debate
which has been dominated by detailed data analysis and speculation rather than model based counterfactual
analysis.
Our starting point is the literature on the global consequences of immigration restrictions (see Hamilton
and Whalley (1984)). In this literature, differences in both wage rates and GDP / capita across countries
are assumed to be supported by immigration restrictions in a world with country specific factor inputs and
downward sloping marginal product of labour schedules for otherwise potentially mobile labour. Parameters
for an assumed underlying technology are calibrated so as to be consistent with observed data on wage
differentials, labour shares of income, and GDP and population by country, and counterfactuals performed
to analyze the impacts of immigration barrier removal. Assumptions that there is homogeneous labour across
countries, or that there are efficiency differences across countries are used as alternatives in these exercises.
Here we make calculations for China as to what the impacts of removing internal (Hukou) barriers to
regional labour mobility on inequality could be using data on both aggregate and regional GDP / capita
using similar methods. In so doing we elaborate on the earlier methodology used to analyze global migration
restrictions by using a simple basic model for which we sequentially develop a number of model elaborations
of increasing complexity. We first ignore inequality within regions and treat labour as homogeneous both
2 We

note that there is suprising disagreement even over this central alleged fact regarding inequality trends in China (see

Chang (2002) and Zhang, Liu and Yao (2001)). Chang (2002) reports results of a number of studies in which data on GDP
or income / capita across provinces in China show only small changes in relative inequality over time, and even reversals (in
contrast to current received wisdom). It is seemingly only in survey data and particularly in the World Bank Living Standards
Surveys that large changes in income inequality in China of approximately the degree suggest above are reported.

across regions and across individuals. In this model wage rates across regions are equalized when migration
restrictions are removed. With region specific fixed factors, regional differences in GDP / capita do not
disappear with barrier removal although they fall sharply and national inequality is much reduced. Significant
efficiency gains also accrue from barrier removal in this model.
We then extend the basic model by also assuming a distribution of efficiency types within each region
and calibrating an extended model to both regional and national estimates of Gini coefficients before barrier
removal, and also regional and national data on GDP / capita. We again remove migration barriers and
recalculate national inequality in the absence of Hukou restrictions. Significant efficiency impacts again
occur but reductions in national inequality are smaller.
In a second elaboration we introduce region specific house price effects and capture their dampening
impacts on migration. This is motivated by the desire to also capture the impacts of sharp increases in
urban house prices and housing rents in China on urban - rural mobility over the last 10 years. We develop
a two good general equilibrium model with goods and housing, in which location specific housing stocks
support differing urban and rural house prices. Equilibrium migration conditions equalize the real value of
wage rates and we incorporate differences in house prices across regions through region specific true cost of
living indices. Removing Hukou restrictions in this model again generates labour flows into urban areas which
now drive up urban house prices which in turn dampens migration. Labour flows under Hukou removal are
smaller and efficiency gains are smaller, but significant redistribution occurs between urban dwellers whose
house prices rise and rural dwellers whose house prices fall.
While findings from these exercises are data and parameter sensitive, they nonetheless jointly point to
significiant impacts from the Hukou system in supporting growing overall relative inequality in China, and
significant efficiency gains from its removal. They also show how economic modelling as well as statistical
techniques can be used to decompose inequality change into various components not only for China but also
for other countries.

SIMPLE INEQUALITY DECOMPOSITIONS USING A BASIC MODEL

The objective of our paper is to assess how inequality in China might behave were it not for the Hukou
system of permanent registration acting as a set of restrictions on labour mobility. We calibrating models
of inter-regional labour mobility in China to base case data incorporating both national and regional Gini
coefficient estimates in the presence of Hukou restrictions and eliminate these restrictions in the model and
recalculate national and regional Gini coefficients as the model counterfactual. We use the same techniques
to assess how many people might migrate, and what the economy wide efficiency gains might be.
We first use a simple model in which each region produces a single good Y according to a region specific
production function in which labour enters as a homogenous factor input which is mobile across all regions.
With decreasing returns to scale production there are returns to region specific fixed factors (rents) and so
in the fully mobile labour case even if wage rates are equalized across regions, GDP per capita across regions
will not be.
We exposit the model structure algebraically for the general case of S regions. If we assume S = 2 we
can group China data in a number of ways: urban and rural; rich and poor; eastern coastal and central
and western (non-coastal) zones; eastern and central and western development zones. If S = 3, we group
by eastern, central and western zones. We also consider a 6 region case of Northern China, Northeastern
China, Eastern China, Central and Southern China, Southwestern China, and Northwestern China. There
are 31 provinces, centrally administered municipalities and autonomous regions in China in total

3

and we

also explore a 31 region variant of the model that captures all of these. Differences in results caross these
cases reflect the degree and form of regional disaggregation in empirical application of the model.
In the model,
s = 1, · · · , S

Ys = fs (Ls ),

(1)

where Ys is production in region s, Ls is labour used in region s, fs0 > 0 and fs00 < 0, and we assume that
P
s Ls = L (full employment). Labour market clearing across regions determines the common wage W = Ws
(s = 1, · · · , S).
Where there are no barriers to labour mobility, i.e., labour receives its marginal product in all regions,
i.e.
W = fs0 (Ls ),

s = 1, · · · , S.

(2)

If there are barriers to mobility of labour across regions, then the interregional labour allocation no longer
corresponds to that supporting a market clearing wage. Suppose this allocation is given as L0s (s = 1, · · · , S)
P
such that s Ls = L, then the marginal products of labour across regions will differ and wage rates Ws
(s = 1, · · · , S) will also differ, i.e. fs0 (L0s ) will differ across s. Removing interregional barriers to labour
mobility in this case implies an efficiency gain for the economy if marginal products of labour are the
equalized across regions.
Figure 1 illustates the case of a 2 region urban - rural economy. Here, initial migration restrictions
support wage rate differences across regions while the common wage W = WU = WR applies when migration
restrictions are removed. Income per capita across the two regions still differs with no migration restrictions
3 We

treat all the provinces, centrally administered municipalities and autonomous regions in China as separate and distinct

entitles (provinces) in the detailed regional calculations reported on later.

as region specific rents differ. Income inequality is much reduced but not eliminated in this case as wage
rates converge across regions. An efficiency gain accrues, as shown, to the whole economy.

The model set out above can be used numerically to assess the distributional impacts of removing Hukou
migration restrictions by calibrating the model to observed wage and GDP / capita differences across the
various two region divides set out above for China. To do this we use a benchmark data set for a given
initial year in the presence of Hukou restrictions on labour mobility, and assess the implications of removing
mobility restrictions given the observed initial differences in GDP / capita and wage inequality. If Ys , Ls ,
and Ws are observed and given by data, we can use the model in calibration mode and solve the system of 2S
equations (3) and (4) for the 2S unknowns As and αs . We can then compute a counterfactual equilibrium
for this simple model in which W = Ws (s = 1, · · · , S) and labour mobility restrictions are eliminated.
Comparing the original data to the solution generated as the counterfactual model equilibrium then yields

assume here that labour migrates only in response to its regional wage, not also its proportional share in rents. The

model can be recast in this form and different numerical results will apply.

an evaluation of the impacts of Hukou on both national and regional income inequality in this simple case.
This same approach can be used in 2 region on more detailed multi-region calculations.
In Table 1 we report estimates of urban, rural and national household income Gini coefficients from
Chang (2002) which show how income inequality has changed China over the last 20 or so years. This is
representative of data claimed to show the growing income divide in China (but see the earlier footnote 1
on the implications of alternative data for recent year). At national level there is consistent worsening of
national inequality which is seemingly always more unequal than regional inequality (as measured by the
Gini coefficient). This is representative of data claimed to show the growing income divide in China (again
see footnote 1 over alternative claims for recent years).

Tables 2 and 3 report the data we use to calibrate alternative versions of the model. Since data on Chinese
GDP / capita (average income) and wage differentials are only readily available on a provincial basis, we
use data for all 31 provinces, centrally administered municipalities and autonomous regions to group regions
in China in various ways. We consider seven different region divides grouping data on population, output,
work force, and wage rate for each.
We first rank provinces from rich to poor (on an income (GDP) / capita basis), taking the top 10
provinces (approximately 35 % of the population) as the rich group. The remaining provinces make up
the poor group. We next group provinces into two eastern coastal and central and southern (non-coastal)
provincial groupings, and two eastern and central and western development zones. We also divide the 31
provinces into 3 zones and 6 regions. We finally consider all Chinese provinces in a 31 region version of the

9

model.

5

In Table 2 and 3 we report the 2001 base year data used to calibrate the 2, 3, and 6 region, and the full
31 regions versions of the labour mobility model. These are GDP / capita by region, wage rate differentials
across regions work force and population by region. Using these data as an input, through calibration we
determine the model parameters As and αs , as well as regional outputs Ys0 , rents Rs0 , and Is0 , I¯s0 , I 0 , I¯0 ,
¯
Js0 , J 0 , and W̄s0 . We assess the impacts of eliminating Hukou restrictions on Ys , Ls , Ws , Rs , Is , I¯s , I, I,
Js , J, W̄s , and solving the model in counterfactual model for the case where wage rates are equalized across
regions determine the migration impacts on work force and population by region.
Tables 4 and 5 report results for numerical simulations showing the impacts of Hukou elimination in
model variants using alternative Chinese regional divides. Table 4 reports cases for four two way divides,
two three way divides, and a six region divide. Table 5 reports results from the more detailed 31 province
calculation. In each case wage differentials across regional divides are eliminated with the removal of Hukou
restrictions, and average incomes across regions are more closely equalized. The differences that remain in
average incomes are due to differences in the size of rents across regions.
For the urban–rural 2 region case in Table 4 the per capita income differential falls from 2 : 1 to 7 : 10,
while in case two (rich–poor) it falls from over 7 : 3 to 4 : 3. In the urban - rural case, approximately 48%
of the work force and 45% of the population move from rural to urban areas after Hukou removal. Around
17% of the population remains in rural areas. They become much richer, their average income (GDP per
capita) being 1.42 times higher than that in urban areas. Total output increases by about 13%, and GDP per
capita and income per worker both increase. In the rich - poor case in Table 4, there are smaller migration
effects after Hukou removal (approximately 25% of the work force and the population move), and total
output increases only by about 3.2%. In the other 2 region case (EC - CW and EC - WD) there are smaller
migration effects from Hukou removal, while total output and GDP per capita and income per worker again
increase. In the 3 region E - C - W case there are big migration effects between Central - Western and
Eastern zones after Hukou removal. Total output increases by about 3.0%. In the 6 region case, migration
effects between regions are small, and total output increases by about 1.7%.
5 There

are 31 provinces, centrally administered municipalities and autonomous regions in the Chinese mainland. The 31

provinces, centrally administered municipalities and autonomous regions ranked from rich to poor by GDP per capita are
Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Fujian, Liaoning, Shandong, Heilongjiang, Hebei, Xinjiang, Hubei,
Jilin, Hainan, Inner Mongolia, Hunan, Qinghai, Henan, Chongqing, Shanxi, Ningxia,Tibet, Anhui, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Shaanxi,
Guangxi, Yunnan, Gansu, Guizhou. The first 10 provinces are grouped as rich. The 21 provinces which follow are group
as poor. Mainland China is divided into 6 regions as follows; Northern China includes 5 provinces: Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei,
Shanxi, Inner Mongolia; Northeastern China includes 3 provinces: Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang; Eastern China includes 7
provinces: Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, Shandong; Central and Southern China includes 6 provinces:
Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan; Southwestern China includes 5 provinces: Chongqing, Sichuan, Guizhou,
Yunnan, Tibet; Northwestern China includes 5 provinces: Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Xinjiang. The Eastern Coastal
zone includes 12 provinces: Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Liaoning, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, Guangdong,
Guangxi, Hainan. The Central zone includes 9 provinces: Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan,
Hubei, Hunan. The Western zone includes 10 provinces: Chongqing, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Tibet, Shaanxi, Gansu,
Qinghai, Ningxia, Xinjiang. The Western Development zone includes 12 provinces as Inner Mongolia, Guangxi, and western
zone. In Tables 2 and 3 and in the discussion that follows, EC - CW zones denote Eastern Coastal zone - Central and Western
zones, EC - WD zones denote Eastern and Central zone - Western Development zone, E - C - W zones denote Eastern zone Central zone - Western zone.

The picture that emerges from Table 4 is that Hukou registration is a significant policy impediment
preventing the achievement of a more equal distribution of incomes and wages in China. The number of
people who would migrate across regions after its removal is between 200 and 600 million in the first 4 cases
1
1
( to of the population of China). Unlike the international migration case where Hamilton and Whalley
6
2
(1984) found very large efficiency effects due to larger initial wage disperssion, the efficiency effects are more
modest but still significant. The gain is 15% of national output in the first case, and around 1.7 − 3.2% in
the other three cases.
Table 5 reports the more detailed 31 region model calculation. An increase in output of around 7% results,
and differentials in both GDP / capita and income per worker across regions are sharply narrowed. Pairwise
migration between provinces is smaller, and migration in aggregate falls. The direction of migration is from
poor to rich provinces, that is, from Henan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Anhui, Guangxi, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Gansu,
Hunan, Chongqing, Jiangxi, Hebei, Shanxi to Guangdong, Shanghai, Beijing, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Fujian,
Tianjin. Again the overall picture converged by these results is similar, removal of Hukou registration would
play a major role in reducing relative income inequality in China.

EXTENDING THE BASIC MODEL TO CAPTURE EFFICIENCY DIFFERENCES
ACROSS INDIVIDUALS AND INEQUALITY WITHIN REGIONS

The model set out above can be elaborated on to also incorporate within region efficiency differences
across individuals and hence inequality within regions both before and after the elimination of Hukou. With
these features present, wage differentials across individuals will not disappear with the elimination of Hukou
registration as in the basic model presented above.
To incorporate efficiency differences across individuals within regions into the model we use a functional
form for the distribution of income within regions which through calibration implies a distribution of the
efficiencies of labour across individuals within a region. This approach allows us to specify initial differences
in efficiencies across all individuals in specific regions of the economy so as to also calibrate a modified version
of the simple model to within region inequality as measured by Gini coefficients for each region, as well as
to a national Gini inequality measure of income inequality. In this model variant removing labour mobility
restrictions once again equalizes wage rates per efficiency unit of labour across regions, but with differing
endowments of efficiency units of labour across individuals wage rate inequality will remain both across
individuals and across regions when Hukou restrictions are removed. An elimination of Hukou restrictions
will be equalizing, but compete equality of wage rates across individuals within regions will not be achieved
as efficiency differences remain.
The model we use for this case can be formally stated as follows. The same equations (3) - (7) characterize
the production side of the model, but there are now also distributions of income within regions which reflect
differences in the efficiency of labour within regions and these need to be incorporated. Denoting Ns as the
number of people in region s, and Ls as labour in efficiency units in region s (Ns 6= Ls ), we have average
¯ and the average region wage W̄s as in (8)
region incomes I¯s , national income I, average national income I,
- (10) above.
The functional form for the income distribution within each region s can take many forms. For simplicity,
we assume a non-linear form for the regional income distribution as
Isn = Cs + Ds n + Es nδs ,

n = 1, · · · , Ns ,

s = 1, · · · , S.

(11)

where n is an index 1, · · · , Ns across the individuals Ns in regions ranked from poor to rich, and Cs , Ds ,
Es and δs are parameters of the distribution function. This provides sufficient free parameters to calibrate
the model to both regional and national Gini coefficients through a generated distribution of efficiencies. If
a simple linear form were used there would not insufficient free parameters for calibration.
Using realtion (11), we calibrate the model to satisfy 2S + 1 conditions reflecting total income and Gini
coefficient constraints and in addition use the same calibration conditions for the simple model above. Since

One difficulty in executing these procedures is that initial data on regional and national Gini coefficients
and estimates of regional and national GDP / capita can be matually inconsistent. Where this occurs, we
have adopted a procedure of accepting data on region and a national GDP / capita, and accepting one or
more of the Gini coefficient estimates from Chang (2002) for 2000 and setting remaining Gini coefficients at
bounds implied by mutual consistency requirements. In this main, there are close to the available literature
estimates, but do depart from these slightly. No other procedure short of modifying other portions of input
data seems to suggest itself.
For the urban - rural case above where S = 2, IU = 5849.777, IR = 4818.847 and I = 10668.626 from
Section 2. If the three Gini coefficients (drawing on Table 1 in Section 2, Chang (2002) and Liu, Yao and
Zhang (2001)) are set as gU = 0.3200, gR = 0.3500 and g = 0.4600, use all these data can be used as
inputs in to calibration. This allows us to calibrate the model for 8(= 4 × 2) unknown distribution function
parameters: Cs , Ds , Es , and δs for s = U, R. If we then remove Hukou restrictions and compute a new
model solution the three computed Gini coefficients are gU = 0.274062, gR = 0.282343 and g = 0.293886.
Compared to the case of the simple model, the impact on inequality of Hukou removal is smaller, but it is
still significant and especially so for national inequality.
For the rich - poor case above S also equals 2, and IR = 5883.043 and IP = 4785.583, I = 10668.626
(from Section 2). Drawing again on Table 1 in Section 2, Chang (2002) and Liu, Yao and Zhang (2001) we
now set the three Gini coefficients to be gR = 0.4094, gP = 0.2030, and g = 0.4600. We again calibrate the
model and compute the 8(= 4×2) unknown parameters: Cs , Ds , Es , and δs for s = R, P , and remove Hukou
restrictions computing a new model solution. The three Gini coefficients in this solution are gR = 0.246542,
gP = 0.179664, and g = 0.261539. Impacts on inequality in this case are once again smaller compared to
the simple model but still significant. Impacts on the three Gini coefficients differ from the urban - rural
case because the initial dispersion in Gini coefficients is larger. For the eastern coastal - central and western
case again S = 2, IEC = 6372.436, ICW = 4296.190 and I = 10668.626 from Section 2. Appealing again
Table 1 in Section 2, Chang (2002) and Liu, Yao and Zhang (2001) we now set the three Gini coefficients as
gEC = 0.4119, gCW = 0.2040 and g = 0.4600. Using these, we again calibrate the model and remove Hukou
restrictions. The three Gini coefficients are gEC = 0.237945, gCW = 0.181590, and g = 0.248018. For the
eastern central - western development 2 region case, IEC = 8833.782, IW D = 1844.844 and I = 10668.626.
The three Gini coefficients are set as gEC = 0.4186, gW D = 0.1600 and g = 0.4600. Removing Hukou
restrictions gives the three Gini coefficients gEC = 0.242071, gW D = 0.148267, and g = 0.280218.
For the 3 region eastern - central - western case S = 3, and IE = 6372.436, IC = 2849.044, IW = 1447.146
and I = 10668.626 (from Section 2). From Table 1 in Section 2, Chang (2002) and Liu, Yao and Zhang
(2001), we now set the three Gini coefficients as gE = 0.4226, gC = 0.1440, gW = 0.1600 and g = 0.4600.
Using these data, we calibrate the model to 12(= 4 × 3) unknown distribution parameters: Cs , Ds , Es , and
19

δs for s = E, C, W . If we remove Hukou restrictions and compute a new model solution in this case the three
Gini coefficients are gE = 0.174241, gE = 0.147957, gW = 0.156591, and g = 0.200101.
We have consolidated these results into a single Table (Table 6) which reports base case and counterfactual
Gini coefficients for this extended model now applied to four alternative regional divides (urban - rural, rich
- poor, and eastern coastal - central and western provinces). Impacts of Hukou removal on inequality as
represented by the Gini coefficients are significant, but impacts are reduced relative to the simple model set
out above since the dispersion in efficiencies across individuals implies that some inequality in wage rates
remains after Hukou removal. Qualitatively this model behaves much as the simple model above.

EXTENDING THE MODEL TO CAPTURE

HOUSE PRICE EFFECTS ON MIGRATION ACROSS REGIONS
A key feature of the urban - rural divide in modern day China missing in the model variants discussed
thus far is large differences in housing (apartment) prices between the larger cities and village communities.
Apartments in Beijing routinely sell for US $ 200,000, and with average annual household incomes of around
US $ 2,000 in the Beijing area, even at 5 % the imputed income on apartments owned outright is typically
larger than annual cash income. Thus, households who received apartments at low (or zero) prices in urban
areas in the late 1980’s or the early 1990’s have a large advantage over rural dwellers who might wish to move
to the cities following a removal of Hukou restrictions. In this case the effect of added inward migration
will be to drive up urban house prices further and this house price effect will act to dampen additional
migration. Less migration following Hukou elimination appears in models incorporating house price effects
in contrast to models which do not incorporate them; but working with them involves the use of a more
complex analytical structure.
We have modified the basic model set out in Section 2 to also incorporate house price effects stemming
from additional urban rural migration. We capture impacts on urban house prices and rents on urban rural mobility decisions by using a general equilibrium model with goods and housing separatly identified,
and with housing prices in urban and rural areas differing reflecting market segmentation due to location.
In this case, removing Hukou restrictions generates labour flows from rural to urban areas, but when these
are included increases in urban house prices retard additional migration. Labour flows under Hukou removal
are smaller and significant further redistribution occurs between urban dwellers whose house prices rise and
rural dwellers whose prices fall. Efficiency gains from Hukou removal will tend to be smaller in models with
house price effects since the number of migrants will be smaller.
We present this model variant more formally as follows. We once again denote Ls as the labour in region
s before Hukou removal. The regional production functions are again
s
Ys = As Lα
s ,

s = U, R

(15)

and the regional wage rates, Ws , are given as
Ws = PG

∂Ys
= PG αs As Lsαs −1 ,
∂Ls

s = U, R

(16)

where PG is the goods price, and regional rents, Rs , are
Rs = PG Ys − Ws Ls ,

s = U, R.

(17)

Income in region s is Is
Is = PG Ys ,
National income is I =

P

s Is .

s = U, R.

(18)

Full employment of labour in this model again implies that
X

Ls = L

s

where L is the national endowment of labour.

(19)

We assume that there is continuum of individuals uniformly distributed over a unidimensional interval
[tR , tU ] for a parameter t who vary in terms of their preferences towards goods and housing, and for whom t is
a preference function parameter varying across all individuals. t̂ is the critical value of preference parameter
such that urban individuals all have t vaules above t̂ and lie on the interval [t̂, tU ] and rural individuals all
have t vaules below t̂ and lie on the interval index [tR , t̂]. The continuum of individuals [tR , tU ] are assumed
to differ in preference shares parameters for Cobb - Douglas preference defined as
Vt (G, H) = G1−t H t ,

t ∈ [tR , tU ].

(20)

We assume for simplicity that all individuals in urban and rural areas have endowments that are similar
insructive, but differ in size. Their incomes are
ItU

t ∈ [t̂, tU ]

(21)

ItR

t ∈ [tR , t̂]

where X U and X R are uniform distribution random variable on [t̂, tU ] and [tR , t̂].

(24)

A general equilibrium in this model involves an equilibrium value t̂, and the division of the population
into urban and rural components is endogenously determined. Before Hukou removal an equilibrium is
characterized by wage rates Ws , a goods price PG , urban and rural house prices PU and PR such that the
following conditions hold.

If we consider the case of Hukou removal, under the assumption that all individuals have identical amounts

(25)

After Hukou removal we need to add a migration equilibrium condition involving a money metric measure
T CL(U, t̂)
, where TCL refers to the time
of the relative valuation of a unit of income across the two regions
T CL(R, t̂)
cost of living index. This term reflects the different price levels across the two regions due to different housing
prices. As TCL indices enter when making migration decisions, individuals take into account not only wage
rate differences across regions, but also the differencet cost of housing.
To construct this metric we use the indirect utility functions

To implement this model we again calibrate to base case data for 2001 and consider Hukou removal.
¿From Table 4 urban and rural non housing GDP in 2001 are 5849.777 and 4818.849. If we assume the
shares of housing / apartments in GDP to be 22.50 % and 18.50 %,

7

then the base case value of the

endowments of housing are 1316.199825 and 891.487065. The consumption value of non housing goods in the
urban and rural areas is 4533.577175(= 5849.777 − 1316.199825) and 3927.361935(= 4818.849 − 891.487065).
Urban and rural labour are 148.236 and 482.291, and wage rates are 16.638050 and 5.739751. Rents are
2067.219177(= 4533.577175 − 16.638050 × 148.236) and 1159.131640(= 3927.361935 − 5.739751 × 482.291).
7 See

the discussion in Weng and Zuo (1999) which from a reading supports estimates of this size for the Mid 1990’s appealing

to survey evidence from various sources.

23

Ignoring housing price effects, we can use the same simple model in Section 2 to analyze the effects
of Hukou removal, but now the non housing portion of the economy is smaller. Through calibration to
this smaller data we compute the scale and power parameters as AU = 298.812076 and AR = 50.437145,
αU = 0.544020 and αR = 0.704857 through calibration. Equilibrium outcomes after Hukou removal are
again in Table 7 – output: YU = 9116.089818 and YR = 1251.721362, work force: LU = 535.295849 and
LR = 95.231151, common wage rate: WU = WR = 9.264667. Labour migration under Hukou removal is
= 535.295849 − 148.236 = 482.291 − 95.231151 = 387.059849 and the efficiency gain to the economy from
the elimination of Hukou restrictions is = 10367.811180 − 8460.939110 = 1906.872070.

To evaluate the impacts of HUkou removal in the presence of house price effects, we use the model set
out above in this Section. We assume the equilibrium prices in the base case are PG = 1, PU = 1 and

IU = 4533.577175 and IR = 3927.361935. Through calibration we compute the scale and power parameters
as AU = 298.812076 and AR = 50.437145, αU = 0.544020 and αR = 0.704857.

CONCLUSIONS AND REMARKS

This paper studies the impacts of the Hukou system of permanent registration on income inequality and
labour migration in China. Its aim is to use numerical modelling to help assess the contribution of various
policy and other factors in China in either contributing to or retarding inequality in China. We use three
model variants to develop results. The base model is taken from Hamilton and Whalley (1984), who evaluate
the impacts of cross country immigration restrictions on global inequality and examines four 2 region cases,
a 3 region case, a 6 region case, and 31 province case in which alternative and groupings divisions of Chinese
data are used. Our extension allows for productivity differences across individuals within each region in
the model and explores income inequality impacts for five model cases. A second house model captures the
effects of higher urban house prices in retarding rural labour movement in to urban areas.
All model results point towards a significant role of the Hukou system in preventing movement towards
a more equal distribution of income in China. There effects are smaller in the second two model variants
than in the first. We see all models as a simplification from a more complex reality, and so we do not aim to
provide from point estimate of impact. But the themes of results seem clear, and in addition we offer new
methodological approaches which can also be used for the analysis of mobility restrictions other economies.
