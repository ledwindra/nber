    "abstract": "\n\nFinancial repression can be used to avoid a government default when fiscal policy is constrained. We present a model showing that optimal financial repression progresses through successive stages with increasing levels of distortion. Data from advanced economies suggest that the initial stage of financial repression typically begins when government debt exceeds 100% to 120% of GDP. Moreover, Japan\u2019s experience suggests that countries such as the U.S. have significant leeway before resorting to the most distortive forms of financial repression.\n\n",
