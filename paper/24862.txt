Preferred Pharmacy Networks and Drug Costs
Amanda Starc and Ashley Swanson
NBER Working Paper No. 24862
July 2018
JEL No. I13,L1
ABSTRACT
Selective contracting is an increasingly popular tool for reducing health care costs, but these
savings must be weighed against consumer surplus losses from restricted access. In both public
and private prescription drug insurance plans, issuers utilize preferred pharmacy networks to
reduce drug prices. We show that, in the Medicare Part D program, drug plans with more
restrictive preferred pharmacy networks, and plans with fewer enrollees who are insensitive to
preferred pharmacy discounts on copays, pay lower retail drug prices. We then use estimates of
plan and pharmacy demand to estimate the first-order costs and benefits of selective contracting
in the presence of enrollees with heterogeneous sensitivity to preferred supplier incentives.

Introduction
In this paper, we examine the effects of selective contracting by health insurers on prices and consumer

access to providers. Intuitively, restrictive networks could help insurers reduce costs through three key
mechanisms. Selective contracting could screen out unprofitable enrollees (Shepard (2016)), steer enrollees
to low-cost pharmacies (Gruber & McKnight (2016), Prager (2017)), and/or give insurers additional leverage to negotiate discounts with pharmacies (Ghili (2018), Gowrisankaran et al. (2015), Ho & Lee (2017),
Liebman (2018), Sorensen (2003)). Any cost savings may be mitigated by lack of enrollee sensitivity to cost
sharing. Furthermore, consumers may prefer access to a broad set of providers, making them more likely to
choose plans with less restrictive networks, even if those plans have higher premiums.
We quantify this trade-off in the Medicare Part D program, the federal prescription drug benefit for the
elderly in the United States. The private firms offering Part D plans are heavily regulated and subsidized, but
in general have both motive and opportunity to manage utilization and seek lower prices. Indeed, researchers
examining the early rollout of Part D beginning in 2006 concluded that the program had a negative effect
on average prices, due mainly to plans’ use of formularies and other utilization management tools to steer
enrollees to lower cost drugs and to negotiate lower prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers (Duggan &
Scott Morton (2010)). More recently, Part D insurers have begun to use similar tactics in negotiation with
pharmacies, by forming restrictive preferred pharmacy networks that exclude many local pharmacies. This
paper is, to our knowledge, the first empirical analysis of pharmacy network contracting.
In Section 2, we describe the institutional details of the setting and document variation in prices for prescription medications purchased in the Medicare Part D program from 2011 to 2014. We provide results for
both branded and generic drugs, but focus particular attention on the market for generic prescription drugs.1
Drug prices are important for policy: in April 2015, the Kaiser Family Foundation found that “making sure
that high-cost drugs for chronic conditions are affordable to those who need them” and “government action to lower drug prices” were the public’s top two health cost priorities for President Barack Obama and
Congress (Altman (2015)). Simultaneously, there has been significant consolidation at multiple points of the
pharmaceutical supply chain (The Health Strategies Consultancy LLC (2005)), implying that price disper1 We

do this because the role of unobserved manufacturer rebates is less important in generic drug markets and therefore our
estimates more likely reflect true price variation (Association for Accessible Medicines (2017)); PBMs are able to secure rebates
of 5-25 percent for branded drugs (CMS (2016), The Health Strategies Consultancy LLC (2005)). Moreover, economists and
policymakers have historically thought of generic drugs as a competition success story. Branded drugs have generally been targeted
in policy discussions of drug pricing, and generic utilization is encouraged by both payers and policymakers. Indeed, 80 percent of
prescriptions filled in $300b US market are generic today (IMS (2012), Thomas (2013)).

sion and growth will remain policy-relevant issues. Our most striking finding regarding prices is that there is
significant price dispersion even within extremely narrowly-defined products and even within generic drugs;
in 2011, the average coefficient of variation across pharmacy chains, within plan, was 0.30 for the same exact generic drug. This evidence of substantial generic price variation suggests that the issue of market power
in generics be revisited, but generic drug prices receive little research or policy attention (see Berndt et al.
(2017) for a recent exception and helpful review).
Section 2 also describes the rise of preferred network contracting and its impact on different enrollees’
prices over this period. While only 13 percent of sample plans used preferred pharmacy networks in 2011,
this rose to 70 percent in 2014. The copay differentials between preferred and non-preferred pharmacies
ranged from $6-$8 per 30-day supply for the most popular plan formulary tiers, indicating that the incentive
to use preferred pharmacies within preferred-network plans was substantial. However, these copay differentials did not generally apply for low-income subsidy (LIS) enrollees, who comprise about 30 percent of
plan enrollment. For example, for LIS enrollees, the maximum copay was $2.55 per 30-day supply for a
generic drug in 2014: both preferred and non-preferred pharmacy copays generally exceed this maximum,
effectively removing the copay differential and, in turn, the incentive to visit preferred pharmacies.
In Section 3, we briefly outline a model of bargaining between pharmacies and plans over prices, preferred network status, and in-network status. We use the model to motivate two reduced form empirical
predictions. The first prediction is that plans with more restrictive pharmacy networks will be able to negotiate lower prices and will achieve further savings from enrollee steering. The second is that plans with
copay-insensitive enrollees will capture limited savings from steering enrollees and will also negotiate higher
prices.
To examine the first empirical prediction, Section 4 begins by estimating the impact of selective contracting between plans and pharmacies on prices. We determine the percent of Medicare-contracting pharmacies
in each Part D region that appear in each plan’s preferred pharmacy network, and analyze the extent to
which more restrictive pharmacy networks impact prices.2 We employ an instrumental variables specification based on heterogeneous diffusion of restrictive networks across issuers over time, and use different
levels of fixed effects specifications to separately identify the effects of patient selection, steering, and negotiation. The estimates from the preferred specification indicate that a standard deviation increase in the
2 This is similar in spirit to Sorensen (2003), in which selective contracting by managed care organizations is used to characterize

MCOs’ “steering ability”: their ability to differentially channel enrollees across providers.

comprehensiveness of a plan’s local preferred pharmacy network (27 percentage points) implies a 1.5-3 percent retail drug price increase. The coefficients are smaller but still significant after controlling for pharmacy
fixed effects, suggesting that results are driven in part by restrictive plans steering enrollees to lower cost
pharmacies and in part by restrictive plans extracting larger discounts from pharmacies.
To examine the second empirical prediction, Section 4 next examines drug prices across plans with high
versus low percentages of low-income subsidy enrollees. The limited ability to steer these consumers is
predicted to affect total drug costs as well as drug-specific negotiated prices. Using a causal identification
strategy based on the institutional rules regarding auto-enrollment of LIS enrollees in the Part D program,
we show that a standard deviation increase in the LIS share of enrollees (14 percentage points) leads to
about an 8-9 percent increase in drug price. Specifications including pharmacy fixed effects have similar
magnitudes, implying that the effect of LIS enrollment on drug prices cannot be attributed entirely to plans’
differential ability to steer enrollees to low-cost pharmacies.
Having confirmed that the expected relationships among steering ability, preferred network contracting,
and price hold true in the data on aggregate, Section 5 estimates models of demand to more clearly link
the reduced form patterns to the mechanisms from the model. We allow for enrollees’ preferences over
pharmacies to depend flexibly on location, age, LIS status, and spending history. We focus our analysis
of preferred network preferences on LIS status and spending history as a proxy for expected costs: as described previously, LIS enrollees are less exposed to pharmacy copay differentials, but we also note that
very high-cost enrollees’ marginal prices do not depend on preferred network status and thus that we might
expect their preference for preferred pharmacies to be muted. First, we show that preferred status has a
large positive effect on pharmacy demand, which is largest for non-LIS enrollees and relatively low cost
enrollees – preferred pharmacies receive 8 percentage points greater market share among non-LIS enrollees
(16 percent) due to preferred status alone. In contrast, LIS enrollees and very high-cost enrollees are less
responsive to preferred status. Second, we demonstrate that plans face tradeoffs in setting the comprehensiveness of their networks: plans with more comprehensive preferred networks receive greater enrollment,
all else equal, and the average enrollee is willing to pay an additional $82 annually for a unit increase in network comprehensiveness (approximately a standard deviation). Third, we simulate counterfactual spending
and consumer surplus under networks that treat preferred and non-preferred pharmacies equivalently, in order to understand how policies that limit preferred network contracting would impact pharmacy costs. Due
to subsidies and cost-sharing structures that limit enrollees’ exposure to preferred pharmacy copay differ4

entials, increased costs from moving to fully comprehensive preferred networks would be relatively small
under the observed distribution of enrollees. On balance, the results imply that preferred network contracting saved $9 per enrollee-year (1 percent annual savings for the average enrollee-year) in 2012-2014. This
works out to approximately $150 million in increased costs for preferred network plans during the same
period. Finally, these modest cost increases are smaller than the consumer welfare benefits associated with
moving to comprehensive preferred networks ($16 per enrollee-year), given enrollees’ revealed willingness
to pay ex ante for network coverage.
This paper draws on and contributes to the literature on drug pricing as well as the literature on market
power and bargaining. While the rising cost of branded drugs is the focus of much attention from economists,
patient advocates, and policymakers (see, e.g., Howard et al. (2015)), the story of generic drug pricing has
generally been a positive one – Scott Morton (1999) demonstrates that patent expiration has historically been
followed by generic entry capturing half of molecule volume at prices 30-50 percent lower than the branded
price. Researchers have argued that Part D has lowered the price of drugs by increasing insurer market
power relative to that of drug manufacturers (Duggan & Scott Morton (2010)); these potential efficiencies,
along with a shift toward generic drugs, have led to program costs lower than forecasted when this benefit
was passed into law. This is not to say that Part D insurers act as perfect agents of enrollees, but rather that
they are well-incentivized to reduce costs; as demonstrated by Ho et al. (2017), drug prices in Part D plans
increased only about 2 percent between 2007 and 2010, but plan premiums grew by 62.8 percent. Finally,
our paper is closely related to the relatively new literature on bilateral bargaining in health care markets –
this literature articulates the important insight that demand intermediaries can exert competitive pressure in
markets with price-insensitive end-users.3
3 For example, Grennan (2013) estimates a model of bargaining between hospitals and medical device suppliers; and Capps et al.

(2003), Sorensen (2003), Gowrisankaran et al. (2015), and Ho & Lee (2017) examine bargaining between insurers and hospitals.
Some papers in this literature explore the nuances of bilateral hospital-insurer contracting when restrictive networks are possible
in equilibrium, as they are in our pharmacy network setting: Shepard (2016) shows that restrictive networks can be used to select
against high-cost enrollees. Ho & Lee (2018) and Ghili (2018) develop methods for estimating models of endogenous restrictive
networks and show that restrictive networks can increase plans’ bargaining leverage with respect to in-network enrollees. In closely
related work, Gruber & McKnight (2016) show quasi-experimental evidence that state employees in Massachusetts who moved to
limited network plans spent 40 percent less on medical care. Finally, Prager (2017) shows that plan networks with multiple hospital
tiers can sensitize consumers’ demand to cross-hospital cost variation and yield significant savings.

Medicare Part D and the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain

2.1

Setting

Medicare is a social insurance program providing health insurance to elderly Americans. Initially passed in
1965, the plan did not cover prescription drugs; a prescription drug benefit was added in 2003. Critically,
the law authorizing this additional benefit – known as Medicare Part D – stipulated that prescription drug
coverage be provided by private health insurers. As a result, enrollees are able to choose from dozens of
plans offered in their local geographic markets. Nearly 41 million of the 57 million people on Medicare (71
percent) enrolled in a Part D plan in 2016 (Hoadley et al. (2016)).4
Though offered by private insurers, Part D is a government benefit and is strictly regulated by the federal
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). CMS mandates coverage generosity of plans in terms
of actuarial value, types of drugs covered, and pharmacy network breadth. Enrollees are entitled to basic
coverage of prescription drugs by a plan with equal or greater actuarial value to a standard Part D plan
with a deductible, an initial coverage region with 75 percent coverage, another coverage gap (known as the
“donut hole”), and a catastrophic region with 95 percent coverage.5 The majority of Part D enrollees are
not enrolled in standard plans, but rather in actuarially equivalent or “enhanced” plans with non-standard
deductibles and tiered copays, so that cost-sharing varies across drugs and pharmacies.6
The private insurers participating in the Medicare Part D program are free to negotiate drug prices with
drug manufacturers, distributors, and pharmacies.7 While Medicare Part D plans must meet certain standards
of coverage for their overall pharmacy networks, plans increasingly use preferred pharmacy networks in or4 Medicare-eligible

individuals can acquire prescription drug coverage through standalone Part D plans or can obtain drug coverage bundled with medical and hospital coverage in the form of “Medicare Advantage” plans. We limit our analysis to standalone
Part D plans in this study, covering about 60 percent of enrollees.
5 Prior to 2011, the donut hole in the standard plan involved no plan coverage of prescription fills. The ACA stipulated that the
donut hole be filled in by 2020. The standard plan for the year 2014 had the following features: a deductible of $310; 75 percent
coverage in the initial coverage region (up to $2,850 in total spending); 52.5 percent coverage of branded costs in the donut hole;
and 95 percent coverage in the catastrophic region (above $6,455 in total spending).
6 With copays, enrollees pay a flat fee out-of-pocket for each prescription; with coinsurance, enrollees pay a percentage of the
total point-of-sale price. Part D issuers’ revenues include premiums paid by enrollees, as well as several types of payments from
CMS, which are about 90 percent of the plans’ revenues in total (Decarolis (2015)): a risk-adjusted direct subsidy for each enrollee;
a low-income subsidy to cover enrollees’ premiums and cost-sharing; reinsurance covering 80 percent of drug spending above the
catastrophic threshold; and “risk corridor” transfers such that the issuers’ profits/losses are within certain bounds.
7 For example, insurers can obtain “rebates” from manufacturers in exchange for preferred placement on insurer formularies.
Essentially, pharmaceutical manufacturers give plans a discount in exchange for plans steering consumers to their drugs. In this
study, we focus on the negotiation between insurers (or rather the pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) acting as insurers’ imperfect
proxies) and pharmacies. While many studies of drug pricing have focused on manufacturers’ market power, pharmacy companies
are quite concentrated and increasingly so – five companies share 60 percent of prescription revenues, and Walgreens and Rite Aid
abandoned plans to merge in 2017. See also Zhu & Hilsenrath (2014).

der to steer consumers to lower cost pharmacies and potentially negotiate lower overall reimbursements.8
The pharmacy networks designed by plans in the Part D program may exclude independent pharmacies or
entire pharmacy chains, so that enrollees will not be able to use plan coverage for prescription fills at those
pharmacies. Alternatively, a pharmacy can be designated as preferred or non-preferred in a plan’s network,
where preferred status implies reduced out-of-pocket costs to enrollees. Critically, network adequacy standards do not apply to the preferred network, so preferred pharmacy networks can be much more restrictive
than plans’ overall networks. This distinction prompted CMS to investigate Part D preferred network coverage in 2015; the report found that plans’ overall networks met or exceeded the statutory access standard,
but one in ten preferred networks offered sufficient preferred pharmacy access to fewer than 40 percent of
urban beneficiaries in their plans’ service areas (CMS (2015b)).
Differential cost sharing can be used to steer consumers and in turn reduce costs, but also exposes enrollees to additional financial risk and reduced access. This may be harmful for low income consumers in
particular; accordingly, approximately 30 percent of Part D enrollees (henceforth, “LIS enrollees”) qualify for low-income subsidies, which entitles them to substantial reductions in premiums and out-of-pocket
costs. LIS enrollees can enroll premium-free in “benchmark plans”: plans for which premiums are below
a market benchmark are eligible for auto-enrollment of LIS enrollees if they do not make an active plan
choice.9 CMS pays LIS enrollees’ benchmark plan premiums, and plan sponsors receive monthly prospective payments from Medicare for LIS enrollees’ estimated cost-sharing, which is later reconciled based on
actual prescriptions filled. Critically, copays for LIS enrollees are low or zero: in 2014, the maximum copay for LIS enrollees prior to the catastrophic threshold was $2.55 for generic drugs and $6.35 for branded
drugs. LIS enrollees tend to have high drug spending and are less likely to respond to copay differentials
across drugs and pharmacies; nevertheless, they may be generally profitable for issuers.10 About one-third
of government expenditure on Part D is directly for LIS-related subsidies.
8 CMS evaluates Part D retail pharmacy networks against standards established for the U.S. military’s TRICARE programs:

e.g.,
at least 90 percent of beneficiaries must reside within two miles of a network retail pharmacy. The analogous standards for suburban
and rural areas are 90 percent within five miles, and 70 percent within fifteen miles, respectively. CMS (2015a) Throughout this
draft, we distinguish preferred pharmacy networks from “overall pharmacy networks,” which include preferred and non-preferred
pharmacies in preferred-network plans.
9 LIS enrollees may actively choose to enroll in non-benchmark plans and pay the differential between the plan premium and
the benchmark premium. A plan may also voluntarily waive the portion of its premium that is a de minimis amount above the
benchmark level and retain some additional auto-enrolled LIS enrollees.
10 This reflects several countervailing factors. LIS enrollees’ costliness is offset by risk-adjustment and the fact that they account
for more spending in the catastrophic region, which is reinsured by CMS. Moreover, auto-enrollment implies that it may be “cheap”
to acquire LIS enrollees (MedPAC (2016)), and Decarolis (2015) notes that plans were historically able to inflate the benchmark
premium by offering multiple plans in each region.

2.2

Data

We utilize data on prescription drug events, plan demand, pharmacy demand, plan characteristics, and pricing from CMS. We observe every prescription fill for the years 2011-2014 for a random 10 percent sample
of all Medicare eligibles. We augment these data with additional information on plans’ formularies, copays,
premiums, and bids. Retail prices are calculated from the prescription drug event data as the total (enrollee
plus plan) cost per day’s supply.11
Table 1 describes the retail price variation in our sample in 2011 and 2014, collapsed to the national drug
code (NDC)-plan j-pharmacy chain H-year level.12 The vast majority of claims in the data are for generic,
rather than branded, drugs, and that proportion is increasing over the time horizon we consider.
In the top row of Table 1, we summarize the distributions of price per 30 days supplied. There is substantial heterogeneity in drug prices, and the distribution of prices has a long upper tail within each year.
The skewness of the price distribution is primarily driven by the long upper tail of branded drugs. The mean
price of branded drugs is 9-15 times as large as that for generic drugs, which accounts for the disproportion11 The

total point-of-sale price we observe will be the sum of a fixed fee per prescription fill plus a fee for the specific drug. Each
is subject to negotiation by a given pharmacy-plan pair.
12 The NDC is a unique 10-digit identifier for human drugs in the United States. It uniquely identifies the labeler (roughly, the
pharmaceutical manufacturer); the specific strength, dosage form (i.e, capsule, tablet, liquid) and formulation; and the package size
and type. A given drug as defined by its brand name or generic name (e.g., atorvastatin calcium for treatment of cholesterolemia,
or the original atorvastatin brand Lipitor) may have many associated NDCs.

8

ate policy attention given to the less-frequently prescribed branded drugs. However, we observe substantial
price dispersion even within generic drugs: in 2011, the standard deviation of generic drug prices was $52,
relative to a mean price of $20.
The Table also shows the weighted average coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by the
mean) of prices across plans j and pharmacy chains H, holding drug “Brand” (e.g., branded Lipitor or
generic atorvastatin) or NDC fixed. The second and fourth rows show the coefficient of variation across
plans within pharmacy chain and, respectively, Brand and NDC. The standard deviation of price across plans
is 12-18 percent of the mean for branded drugs, versus 24-30 percent of the mean for generic drugs. The
third and fifth rows show the coefficient of variation across pharmacy chains within plan and, respectively,
Brand and NDC. For branded drugs, the coefficients of variation are a bit larger across chains than across
plans: 13-16 percent versus 12 percent in 2011, and 19-23 percent versus 18-19 percent in 2014. This is also
the case for generic drugs, but it bears noting that the “within Brand” price dispersion is much larger than the
“within NDC” price dispersion, reflecting the fact that different pharmacy chains may stock different generic
NDCs, potentially from different pharmaceutical manufacturers, within a given drug. Arguably, it is this
“formulary power” that pharmacies have for generic drugs that enables them to make much larger margins
on generic drugs than branded drugs (Sood et al. (2017)). To put these statistics in context, the coefficient
of variation for prices charged by different hospitals is 0.32 for knee replacement and 0.4 for magnetic
resonance imaging (Cooper et al. (2015)); and the average coefficient of variation across retail stores for
common household goods is 0.18 (Scholten & Smith (2002)). Thus, there is economically meaningful price
dispersion across both plans and pharmacy chains within truly homogeneous products, and even within the
generic drug markets, where one might expect close to perfect competition.
To more concretely show how price dispersion persists even within narrowly defined product categories,
Figure 1 describes two examples of the above phenomenon. First, in the top two panels, we display prices
for Crestor, a popular branded statin drug for hyperlipidemia. Among all NDCs, there is evidence of price
dispersion (the coefficient of variation is 0.34), and even within the most popular single NDC – 10mg of the
drug packaged in a 90 day supply – the interquartile range in price per day supply is $1.23 (the mean is $5.15
and the coefficient of variation is 0.15). Among generics, there is even more dispersion in relative terms. In
the bottom two panels, we display prices for levothyroxine, a popular drug used to treat hyperthyroidism.
Among all NDCs, we see substantial variation, though the bimodal price distribution could reflect variation
across products and manufacturers. However, when we restrict attention to the highest volume NDC – 50
9

microgram tablets, manufactured by Mylan – we still see substantial variation in prices across plans (the
coefficient of variation is 0.40).
Table 2 describes the plans in our data. The first row indicates whether a given plan relied on preferred
pharmacy networks; the proportion of plans with preferred networks increased from 13 percent in 2011 to 70
percent in 2014.13 While we focus on selective contracting in Medicare Part D, it should be emphasized that
commercial payers have begun to use narrow pharmacy networks in recent years as well; e.g., almost half
of all employers had a narrow pharmacy network in 2016 (Fein (2017)). The next row shows a measure of
pharmacy network coverage for each plan – this measure equals the percent of Medicare Part D-contracting
pharmacies in a given plan’s Part D region that are in the plan’s preferred network.14 The coverage rate of
local pharmacies drops from 63 percent in 2011 to 35 percent in 2014. The rise of preferred networks and
the narrowing of preferred networks implies significant growth in the prevalence of restrictive-network plans
with fewer than 50 percent of local pharmacies preferred. The next row shows that the prevalence of restrictive networks grew from 22 percent in 2011 to 76 percent in 2014. A plan can have a restrictive preferred
network either if it has a restrictive overall network (whether it relies on preferred network contracting or
not) or if it only has a restrictive preferred network – 60 percent of preferred networks were restrictive in
2011, versus 99 percent in 2014.

15

To provide more granular detail on this phenomenon, Table 12 in the Appendix displays transition
matrices regarding retail chains’ preferred status across all plans in 2012-2013. While chains C and D
13 We classified each plan and retail pharmacy with non-zero claims as preferred versus non-preferred using both an “empirical”
networks file and the CMS public use plan network files. The empirical networks file was created by analyzing the observed enrollee
out-of-pocket cost for all claims for the initial coverage phase, for non-LIS enrollees, in fills that were for multiples of a 30-day
supply, and that had a formulary tier assignment. We only analyzed observations where network status could potentially be detected
(e.g., enrollee out-of-pocket cost < total retail cost). We compared out-of-pocket costs to copays for preferred and non-preferred
retail pharmacies in the beneficiary cost files. We generated two “preferred” flags: (1) an indicator for the plan-pharmacy being
flagged as preferred more often than not; and (2) a more conservative indicator that (a) there were at least 25 informative claims
for the plan-pharmacy, (b) the plan-pharmacy had at least 5 “preferred” claims, and (c) the plan-pharmacy matched as “preferred”
for at least 5 more claims than as “non-preferred.” To combine the empirical and public use network files, we prioritized the more
conservative empirical networks preferred flag, then the less conservative empirical networks preferred flag, then the public use
flag. Where we have both empirical and public use network observations, they are consistent 99 percent of the time. Finally, we
combine observations across pharmacies in the same retail chains: preferred status is consistent across pharmacy within plan-chain
99 percent of the time.
14 Preferred network status is inferred by comparing observed copays for non-subsidized enrollees in the prescription drug event
data to copays for preferred and non-preferred pharmacies in the beneficiary cost files. For plans without preferred networks, all
pharmacies in the retail network are considered preferred.
15 A natural question that arises is why plans began relying heavily on preferred network contracting only after 2011. A complete
answer to this question is outside the scope of this paper, but we note several factors that may have been influential. First, early
preferred network arrangements involved plan-pharmacy co-branding (e.g., The Humana Walmart-Preferred Rx Plan, introduced
in 2011) (Snook & Filipek (2011), Hoadley et al. (2015)). Second, high-profile disputes between Walgreens and two large PBMs
in 2010 and 2012 – CVS Caremark and Express Scripts – resulted in short-term removal of Walgreens from the PBMs’ networks,
during which the PBMs noted limited disruptive impacts of restrictive networks (Casey (2013)).

Notes: Number of plan-year observations across 2011-2014 indicated for each plan-level variable.The “%
Preferred” variable is calculated as the ratio of the count of preferred pharmacies in the plan’s PDP region to
the count of pharmacies in the same PDP region across all sample plans’ preferred and non-preferred
networks. LIS enrollees identified as those with any low-income cost-sharing subsidies in the prescription
drug event data.

were preferred in over half of preferred-network plans in 2013, chain A was preferred in only 38 percent of
plans and chain B in only 5 percent of plans. Preferred network status is fairly stable within plans across
years, though there are notable exceptions. For example, chain A was dropped from 7 percent of preferred
networks between 2012 and 2013, while chain C was added to 6 percent of preferred networks in the same
time frame. We will leverage the variation in network generosity across plans in our reduced form analyses
in Section 4.1; we will also rely on variation across plans in which chains are in the preferred networks in
Section 5.
The next rows in Table 2 describe plans’ coverage of LIS enrollees in our data. We construct the “%
LIS subsidy” as the percentage of the plan’s total drug bill paid for by the federal government in the form
of cost-sharing subsidies for low-income consumers. While the average coverage of LIS enrollees is stable
at around 17 to 20 percent of drug spending, this conceals considerable variation. Figure 2 shows that
the distribution of this variable is bimodal; there are a set of plans with very few consumers eligible for
these subsidies, and plans for which LIS subsidies represent a major component (nearly 40 percent) of
reimbursements. Some of this heterogeneity is driven by variation in benchmark status, which we leverage
in our identification strategy below. To be eligible for auto-enrollment of LIS beneficiaries, plans must have
bids below a benchmark level. Table 2 also shows that approximately one-third of plans are below the
benchmark.
Finally, Figure 3 summarizes the differences between preferred and non-preferred pharmacy copays by
year and formulary tier. We focus on copays for drugs on tiers one through three of Part D plan formularies, as preferred copays are rarely used for higher drug tiers.16 As expected, copays were increasing
in formulary tier within each year as drugs become less and less preferred – the average tier one (three)
preferred pharmacy copay was $1 ($43) over this time period. Second, the absolute differences in copays
across preferred and non-preferred pharmacies were relatively flat across formulary tier, ranging from $6 for
tier one drugs to $8 for tier three drugs in the average plan-year. Accordingly, relative copay differentials
were often largest for tier one drugs, which were typically preferred generics. At an extreme, copays for tier
one fills for preferred pharmacies were $0 for 36 percent of preferred network plan-years, implying that the
non-preferred pharmacy copays for tier one fills were infinitely higher. Finally, given the observed copays,
16 High

drug tiers are generally reserved for branded drugs, implying that variation in prices across pharmacy chains is smaller in
relative terms. Moreover, another way for plans to steer enrollees is to charge enrollees a coinsurance rather than a copay. If there
are significant price differentials across pharmacies (and enrollees are aware of these differences), then coinsurance may work just
as well as copays; accordingly, coinsurance is generally used for enrollee cost-sharing for high-cost specialty drugs on formulary
tiers five and six.

13

Figure 2: Histogram of “% of LIS Subsidy”

it is notable that preferred copay differentials were only relevant for LIS enrollees for tier one generic drug
fills: as noted above, LIS enrollees faced maximum copays of $2.55 and $6.35 in 2014 (and in a similar
range in earlier years).

Preferred Network Contracting: Mechanisms and Predictions

Gatekeeping by insurers may increase or decrease total welfare; to understand the impact of preferred pharmacy networks, we must understand the incentives for insurers to offer such plans. As noted previously,
selective contracting could reduce insurers’ costs by selecting favorable enrollees, steering enrollees to lowcost providers, and/or providing leverage to negotiate lower prices. In this Section, we focus on the steering
and bargaining mechanisms, and outline a model of pharmacy demand, plan demand, and bargaining.17 The
model largely follows the literature on insurer-hospital bargaining as in Ho & Lee (2017) and Gowrisankaran
et al. (2015): negotiated prices are a Nash equilibrium of simultaneous bilateral Nash bargains and maximize
the Nash product of the upstream (pharmacy) and downstream (plan) firms’ gains from trade.
As described in detail in Appendix B, we generate empirical predictions using a model in which a set of

pharmacies bargains with a set of plans over network status and point-of-sale drug prices. Consistent with
the institutional details of the setting, a given pharmacy-plan pair may be in the preferred network, in the
non-preferred network, or out of network. Given pharmacy networks, premiums, copays, and other plan,
individual, and market characteristics, each Medicare beneficiary chooses which plan to enroll in, if any.
After enrolling in their Part D plans, individuals receive prescriptions from physicians and choose which
pharmacy to frequent.
Both plans and pharmacies face important trade-offs in this negotiation. From the pharmacies’ perspective, plans may steer additional consumer demand to a specific pharmacy or pharmacy chain in exchange for
retail price discounts. From the plans’ perspective, restrictive networks allow plans to steer consumers to
lower cost pharmacies, and the threat of exclusion could lead to a lower negotiated price at a given pharmacy;
however, if consumers have a strong tastes for broad networks, narrower networks will reduce enrollment.
These mechanisms rely on consumer demand being responsive to differential copays; this may not be true
if a large subset of consumers is insulated from cost sharing.
The Appendix presents a formal description of the Nash bargaining solution. In short, the model illus-

15

trates that the price negotiated between a given pharmacy and plan is mediated by several factors, similar
to those presented in detail in Ho & Lee (2017). These are: the plan’s relative bargaining power; the
pharmacy’s ability to “recapture” volume from other plans when the pharmacy’s network status changes;
a “premium effect” capturing plan premium revenue lost if enrollees re-sort when the pharmacy’s network
status changes; a “price reinforcement” effect resulting from strategic complementarity of competing pharmacies’ prices; and finally, a “preferred capture effect” embodying the change in the pharmacy’s volume if
it loses preferred-network status.18
For our purposes, the theory provides two key predictions for how the threat of exclusion will impact
drug prices over and above those achieved directly by steering enrollees to cheaper pharmacies. First, plans
with more restrictive networks are expected to have larger preferred capture effects (similar to Sorensen
(2003)) and smaller price reinforcement effects, each of which implies lower negotiated prices. Second,
plans with more “copay-sensitive” enrollees are expected to have larger preferred capture effects and, in
turn, lower negotiated prices with preferred network pharmacies.19 LIS enrollees are unlikely to respond
to preferred/non-preferred pharmacy copay differentials, so that LIS enrollment will limit the cost-savings
available with preferred networks.

Reduced Form Analyses of Price Levels

In this Section, we use Medicare pricing data to test the two key empirical predictions outlined above. First,
we estimate the effect of plans’ network comprehensiveness on prices. Second, we examine the effect of
coverage of low-income subsidy enrollees on negotiated prices.

4.1

Prices and plan network generosity

The model predicts that plans with high usage of selective contracting will be able to obtain lower prices for
drugs. In this Section, we examine the relationship between network restrictiveness and the level of retail
18 The

key distinctions between our model and that in Ho & Lee (2017) are that we model both preferred and non-preferred
prices, and that the preferred price is a function of the “preferred capture” effect.
19 The preferred capture effect is an equilibrium artifact – it will be higher if enrollees are more sensitive to copay differentials
between preferred and non-preferred pharmacies.

16

prices. We estimate specifications of the following type:

ln pd jhq = α + β ∗ % Pre f jq + X0d jhq γ + εd jhq .

In this equation, our coefficient of interest is β , which represents our estimate of the average impact of
having more local pharmacies in a plan’s preferred network on negotiated prices. We also allow for specifications in which the percentage preferred enters nonlinearly. We model drug prices at the plan-quarterpharmacy-NDC level, and all specifications include quarter fixed effects. We also show specifications that
include fixed effects for NDC, pharmacy and, in some cases, issuer.20
Table 3 shows several different versions of the effect of selective contracting. In this Table, each number
shown is the result of a separate regression of log price on a particular sample (Panel A: All Drugs; versus
Panel B: Generic Drugs only), with a particular set of fixed effects (different columns), and with a different
right-hand-side variable proxying for comprehensiveness (different rows within each panel).
First, we focus on the top row in each panel, in which network size is measured as “% Preferred.” Column (1) shows that negotiated prices are increasing in the percent of local pharmacies in a plan’s preferred
network; the standard deviation of this measure in our sample is 27 percentage points, so the estimated
coefficient of 0.324 (0.205 for generic drugs only) implies that a standard deviation increase in pharmacy
coverage increases price by 9 percent (6 percent for generics only). However, column (1) controls only for
quarter fixed effects; it does not account for the potential that plans with more restrictive pharmacy networks
attract healthier enrollees taking cheaper drugs. In Table 2, we see that plans with less than 50 percent of
pharmacies preferred enroll beneficiaries with lower utilization (an average 1,645 days supply or $3,535
in total drug spending per year, which is slightly lower than the 1,664 days supply ($3,751) observed for
non-restrictive plans).
To address this, column (2) includes NDC fixed effects, so that we now examine the association between pharmacy network breadth and pricing for a narrowly-defined product. This reduces the coefficient
substantially – within NDC, a standard deviation increase in preferred network size is associated with a price
increase of about 3 percent. Column (3) adds pharmacy fixed effects; the coefficient on network coverage
is cut roughly in half, implying that a standard deviation in preferred network size is associated with a price
20

In the foregoing, we will generally use the terms “contract” and “issuer” interchangeably – e.g., Humana or United.

increase of about 1.4 percent. Thus, about half of the association between restrictive networks and prices
exists within pharmacy.
Columns (4)-(6) estimate the same specifications as in columns (1)-(3), but with the addition of contract
fixed effects. These specifications control for unobserved, time-invariant differences across issuers in their
ability to negotiate prices and/or steer enrollees. Column (4) estimates a significantly smaller effect than
column (1) – i.e., some of the raw correlation between network size and prices is due to unobserved differences across issuers. However, columns (5) and (6) are similar to (2) and (3), indicating that within-issuer
variation in preferred network size is significantly associated with retail prices.
The second and third rows in each panel show nonlinear versions of this result in both absolute and
relative terms (recall that we saw previously that average network restrictiveness is increasing over 20112014). In the second row, we estimate that plans with “restrictive networks,” defined as those covering
less than 50 percent of local pharmacies, have 4-6 percent lower prices, conditional on NDC fixed effects
(columns (2) and (5)); to put this in perspective, recall that 41 percent of plans covered less than 50 percent
of local pharmacies in 2011-2014 overall, versus 76 percent in 2014. Columns (3) and (6) show that about
half of this association remains when we add pharmacy fixed effects. The third row shows that plans in the
top 25 percent of plans in terms of network coverage within a given year (82 percent of local pharmacies
covered on average in 2011-2014, and 71 percent in 2014 alone) negotiate 3-5 percent higher prices than
plans in the bottom 75 percent. This decreases to about 2 percent when we include pharmacy fixed effects.
One potential concern with these OLS specifications is that selective contracting may be endogenous;
for example, plans that are for unobservable reasons better able to negotiate favorable discounts with local
pharmacies may also be better able to construct high-quality limited pharmacy networks. In alternative
specifications, we use general trends in selective contracting over time, which are borne out differentially
across geographic regions, to provide plausibly exogenous variation in selective contracting across planyears. We argue that network comprehensiveness is a strategic decision taken at the issuer-year level (based,
perhaps, on issuer-time-varying factors that impact average prices), but that price negotiations for a given
contracting organization and year vary across markets due to plausibly exogenous factors such as the preexisting geographic footprint of pharmacy chains. Motivated by this reasoning, we present analyses in which
we instrument for network coverage in a given issuer-year-region using that same issuer-year’s average
network coverage (weighted by enrollment) across other regions.
The first stage of this identification approach can be seen visually in Figure 4, which shows a binned

scatterplot of the instrumental variable (weighted average percent of networks that are preferred in all other
markets, within the same issuer-year) versus the potentially endogenous variable of interest (percent of
networks that are preferred by the issuer in the current market). This is shown separately for each year.
First, we observe a general trend toward more selective contracting (fewer pharmacies preferred) over time.
Second, Figure 4 shows that this trend is correlated within issuer-year: within each year 2011-2014, there is
a significant positive correlation between current-market preferred network size and preferred network size
in other markets, within the same issuer.
This relationship can be seen more formally in the first row in each panel of Table 4, which shows the
linear first stage relationship between our variable of interest (percent of local pharmacies preferred) and our
instrument (weighted average percent of pharmacies preferred in other markets for the same issuer-year).
Different columns show the results for different fixed effects specifications as in Table 3 above. In all cases,
the first stage relationship is highly significant and close to one-for-one.
The second and third rows in each panel show the reduced form and two-stage least squares results, respectively. The results, including those that include contract fixed effects to control for potential differences

Notes: Table reports estimated first stage, reduced form, and two-stage least squares coefficients
for the dependent variable ln(pd jhq ), endogenous variable “% Preferred”, and instrument “%

across contracting organizations in their ability to negotiate with pharmacies, are similar to our OLS results
above. The results with NDC fixed effects (columns (2) and (5)) indicate that a standard deviation increase in
network size implies a causal increase in price of 1.5-3 percent. The results with NDC and pharmacy fixed
effects (columns (3) and (6)) shrink this effect to 1-1.8 percent. Results are similar for all drugs and for
generic drugs only. Point estimates are generally smaller when we include contract fixed effects, suggesting
the importance of controlling for time-invariant differences across issuers even in this instrumental variables
specification; however, the difference between specifications with and without contract fixed effects tend not
to be statistically significant.
The above analyses indicate that plans with larger preferred networks pay significantly higher prices, and
that this relationship is causal. Also, we found that about one-half to two-thirds of the estimated effects of
network size on price persist within pharmacy and thus can be explained by the impact of threat of exclusion
on negotiated prices. The remainder can be explained by the effects of steering, though standard errors are
large and limit our ability to precisely isolate steering and “threat of exclusion” effects.

4.2

Prices and steering
Given the model described in the previous Section, we hypothesize that patient cost-sharing subsidies

will reduce the price sensitivity of the ultimate consumers of drugs. Therefore, the “supply side” of the
market (which includes manufacturers, wholesalers, and pharmacies) will be able to command higher prices
for drugs. We now turn to documenting this fact and providing causal evidence linking subsidies to higher
drug prices. Specifically, we estimate the effect of the presence of LIS subsidies on retail prices, using
specifications of the following type:

ln pd jhq = α + β ∗ % LIS jq + X0d jhq γ + εd jhq .

In this equation, our coefficient of interest is β , which represents our estimate of the average impact of
the presence of inelastic LIS consumers on negotiated prices. We also estimate a specification in which the
fraction of LIS enrollees enters nonlinearly. As before, we model drug prices at the plan-quarter-pharmacyNDC level. All specifications include quarter fixed effects.
Table 5 describes the correlation between LIS coverage and price in several ways; in this Table, each
number shown is the result of a separate regression of log price on a particular sample (Panel A: All Drugs;

22

versus Panel B: Generic Drugs only), with a particular set of fixed effects (different columns), and with a
different right-hand-side variable proxying for LIS enrollment (different rows within each panel). In the
first row of each panel, we show the association between price and our measure, by plan, of the percent of
drug spending that is covered by LIS cost sharing subsidies. This measure ranges from 0 percent (no LIS
beneficiaries) to 96 percent, depending on the plan; the mean across plan-years in our data is 19 percent.
Column (1) shows that the higher this measure of exposure to LIS enrollees is, the higher the average
negotiated drug price. The coefficient of 0.917 (0.533 for generics) implies that a standard deviation increase
in this measure (14 percentage points) would increase the price of the average drug by 13 percent (7 percent
for the average generic drug). However, LIS enrollees tend to be sicker – in Table 2, we see that LIS enrollees
have $5,500 in annual drug spending, versus $2,700 for non-LIS enrollees. Some of this may of course be
accounted for by the mechanism of interest – the inability to steer LIS enrollees – but LIS enrollees also
consume more prescriptions per year, averaging 1,800 days supply (versus 1,500 for non-LIS enrollees).21
To account for both selection and manufacturer market power, column (2) includes NDC fixed effects, so
that we now examine the association between LIS coverage and pricing for a narrowly-defined product, and
holding the pharmaceutical manufacturer fixed. Inclusion of NDC fixed effects reduces the magnitude of
the coefficient substantially, to 0.15-0.16, now implying that a standard deviation increase in LIS coverage
is associated with a small, but statistically significant, 2 percent increase in price. We next control for
pharmacy fixed effects – by comparing columns (2) and (3), we can distinguish between LIS enrollees’ use
of high-cost pharmacies (column (2)) and a tendency of plans covering many LIS enrollees to pay higher
prices within pharmacy (column (3)). In column (3), the association between “% LIS” and price becomes
negative and insignificant, indicating that the positive correlation between LIS coverage and price does not
hold within pharmacy. Column (4) further controls for contract fixed effects and thus isolates variation in
the number of LIS beneficiaries across plan-years within a given issuer – the results are similar to the third
column, though with more precise standard errors.
There is, of course, no reason to believe that the relationship between LIS exposure and retail prices
21

Moreover, LIS enrollees are insulated from copay differentials across pharmacies and across drugs (with the exception of the

brand-generic distinction in the maximum LIS copay) – insurers’ inability to steer LIS enrollees to inexpensive drugs may increase
prices set by pharmaceutical manufacturers. The larger relative magnitude of this coefficient for all drugs versus generics may be
consistent with the latter mechanism.

would be linear. To capture potential non-linearities, the second row in each panel of Table 5 instead analyzes
the association between drug price and a dummy for the top quartile of LIS exposure; we report the effect
of being in the top quartile of plans in terms of LIS coverage as compared to the first through third quartiles.
The patterns here largely mimic those in the first row of each panel. Plans in the top quartile of LIS coverage
pay 12-18 percent higher prices, but this figure drops to 3-4 percent within NDC. As before, the results shrink
to zero and (in some cases) become negative with the inclusion of pharmacy fixed effects.
One potential concern is that factors associated with high LIS enrollment in particular plans are not
captured adequately by our controls. This concern is mitigated by focusing on price variation within a welland narrowly-defined product (the NDC). However, plans that choose to “specialize” in LIS enrollees may
be more or less able to extract discounts from pharmacies for a variety of reasons.22 To account for this
potential issue, we next use the structure of the LIS program to generate variation in the level of subsidies
across plans.
To illustrate this identification strategy, we compare plans with bids above (not eligible for LIS autoassignment) and below (eligible for LIS auto-assignment) the benchmark amount. Because of LIS autoassignment, bidding below a benchmark amount will lead to a large influx of price insensitive consumers.
Figure 5 shows that the fraction of drug spend covered by LIS subsidies changes discontinuously as one
moves across the discontinuity at the benchmark.23 We hypothesize that this will also increase the retail
prices paid by plans.
To explore this hypothesis, we next plot a binscatter of the prices for the cholesterol-lowering statin
Crestor (one of the most popular drugs within the Part D program) as a function of bids relative to the
benchmark. Figure 6 shows a discontinuous drop in retail prices for Crestor as one crosses the benchmark,
which, as shown above, corresponds to a decrease in the number of LIS beneficiaries (and associated sales)
within a plan.
Of course, it is not necessarily suprising that branded manufacturers have the ability to price discriminate
based on plan demographics.24 However, Figure 6 also shows a similar discontinuous price drop for generic
22 For

example, given the potential profitability of LIS enrollees noted by Decarolis (2015), savvy issuers that are particularly
successful at attracting LIS enrollees might also be particularly successful at negotiating lower drug prices.

This
policy implies that the bin just to the right of the “discontinuity” includes some plans allowed to continue auto-enrollment. As a
result, some of our instrumental variables estimates discussed below are from a fuzzy regression discontinuity design.

To operationalize this identification strategy, we instrument for “% LIS” in our specifications above using
benchmark bidding. Contemporaneous benchmark bidding may not satisfy the exclusion restriction: to the
extent that the benchmark is (even imperfectly) known in advance, firms could strategically choose to be
above or below the benchmark, and this choice could be correlated with other factors influencing negotiated
prices. To address this issue, we examine the impact of being just below the 2009 benchmark.26 Given the
substantial level of inertia exhibited by consumers in this market (Ho et al. (2017)), this variable will predict
the level of LIS subsidies within a plan two to five years later. In all specifications, we also include quadratic
controls for the difference between the bid and the benchmark. Finally, in some specifications, we narrow
in on the key variation of interest (the discontinuity introduced by the benchmark) and identify the effect of
LIS enrollment using variation from plans with bids within $4 of the benchmark, where $4 is the optimal
bandwidth from Ericson (2014).
Table 6 presents the first stage, reduced form, and two-stage least squares estimates for this instrumental
variables strategy. As before, Panel A shows results for all drugs, Panel B for generics only. Given that
our instrument based on 2009 benchmark status is cross-sectional, we omit contract fixed effects from these
specifications, but again include specifications with quarter fixed effects only (columns (1)-(2)), quarter and
NDC fixed effects (columns (3)-(4)), and quarter, NDC, and pharmacy fixed effects (columns (5)-(6)). The
first row in each panel shows that 2009 benchmark status leads to roughly a 7-10 percentage point increase in
LIS enrollment in 2011-2014; results are larger when we focus on a narrow bandwidth around the benchmark
discontinuity. The second row in each panel shows the reduced form effect of prior benchmark status on
contemporaneous prices. The results show that being just below the 2009 benchmark leads to 12-23 percent
higher retail prices, with the lower range pertaining for generics. However, as with the OLS results, we are
concerned about this being driven by LIS enrollees’ higher latent drug needs or steering of LIS enrollees
atorvastatin had generic substitutes available for much of our sample period.

25 The

most popular drug by claim count, lisinopril, a blood pressure drug, experienced a number of voluntary recalls during our
sample period.
26 In 2009, the formula used to calculate benchmarks was modified and the transition to enrollment-based benchmarks was
completed (Decarolis (2015)), making it more difficult for firms to “game” the benchmark.

Finally, we continue to see a positive and usually significant reduced form effect of benchmark status on
prices when we include pharmacy fixed effects.
The last row in each panel of Table 6 presents the results of the two-stage least squares specifications.
Our results are much larger in the first set of specifications (excluding NDC fixed effects), as we saw in the
reduced form. Once we include NDC fixed effects, the results are consistent across the remainder of the
specifications shown, and do not differ significantly between “All Drugs” and “Generics Only.” Focusing
27 These would still be causal effects, but would not be driven by the mechanism of interest – steering of enrollees across
pharmacies.

28

on all drugs, the results imply that a standard deviation in LIS share leads to a 8-9 percent increase in
retail prices for a given drug. The 2SLS estimates are larger in magnitude than the OLS results, indicating
downward bias in the OLS results.28 Notably, in the 2SLS specification, the results with pharmacy fixed
effects are similar to the results without, implying a 6-10 percent increase in price associated with a standard
deviation increase in LIS share.
These results provide evidence of suppliers in this market extracting higher retail prices from plans with
larger numbers of price-insensitive enrollees. Notably, the results of the two-stage least squares specifications remain positive and generally significant when we include controls for pharmacy fixed effects. That
is, the positive causal effect of LIS enrollment on drug prices cannot be attributed entirely to enrollees using
more expensive pharmacies, though the size of confidence intervals limits our ability to decompose price
differences into a steering effect and a threat of exclusion effect. Together with the network results, these
results are strongly consistent with the mechanism of interest – that high LIS enrollment limits plans’ ability
to extract discounts from particular pharmacies using preferred pharmacy networks. However, it is still possible that the LIS results are driven by, for example, an effect of LIS enrollment on plans’ negotiations with
manufacturers for particular drugs. In the next Section, we tie these results together explicitly by demonstrating the effect of preferred networks on LIS and non-LIS enrollees’ demand for pharmacies. We also use
plan demand analysis to analyze the welfare impacts of restrictive networks.

5

Demand Models and Counterfactuals

Our approach uses plausibly exogenous variation across plans and geographic areas to explore the impact
of steering by insurers on drug prices. Gruber & McKnight (2016) find that limited network plans generate
large savings on medical care, while Prager (2017) finds savings from tiered hospital plans of 8-12 percent,
depending on the policy experiment. We build on these findings in the context of prescription drug insurance,
and focus explicitly on a key prediction from theory: limited or preferred networks are only likely to generate
savings only to the extent that a plan can steer consumers.
The reduced form results show that a standard deviation increase in plan restrictiveness (27 percentage
points) leads to a 1.5-3 percent decrease in average prices paid. By contrast, a standard deviation increase
in LIS share (14 percentage points) increases average prices paid by 8-9 percent.29 In this Section, we
28 This bias could be due to a number of factors, including confounds that are negatively correlated with LIS enrollment and
prices, measurement error, and functional form.
29 The former result suggests that the causal effect of LIS enrollment is unlikely to be driven entirely by the effect of LIS subsidies

29

explore the interaction between network comprehensiveness and enrollees’ sensitivity to networks directly,
and go further to quantify the welfare tradeoffs between cost and access. We measure consumer preferences
for physical pharmacy locations given their exposure to cost sharing; using very rich claims-level data, we
explore how heterogeneity in demand relates directly to steering ability by insurers. Specifically, we ask two
key questions. First, how much would costs increase if preferred networks were eliminated, and how would
this effect vary by enrollee type? Second, how much would the cost of the Part D program fall if preferred
network plans could be used to steer LIS consumers to cheaper pharmacies? In both cases, we will show
modest but meaningful savings and quantify the welfare benefits and costs of restricting pharmacy access.

5.1

Pharmacy Demand Model

Our model of pharmacy demand builds on the approaches of Ho & Lee (2017) and Raval et al. (2017), among
others. Given exogenous drug consumption needs, consumers choose a pharmacy to fill their prescriptions.
Preferences are allowed to vary flexibly across consumer type, and the estimates are used to calculate the
expected utility from each insurer network, which will then be included as a plan characteristic in a model
of enrollees choosing Part D plans. We group consumers into types based on quintile of previous drug
spending, geography (three-digit zip code), age (above or below age 75), and LIS status. This allows for
different substitution patterns based on subsidies, geography, and heterogeneous drug needs in a flexible
way. Individuals can visit any in-network preferred or non-preferred pharmacy, but the copay may vary by
pharmacy, as described above. We parameterize the utility of consumer of type i in plan j in quarter q filling
their prescriptions at pharmacy h as:

c
ui jhq = δi jy + δihy + δiq + π ICR
jhy βl(i) + εi jhq .

This exercise focuses on steering between preferred and non-preferred pharmacies that are part of retail
pharmacy chains – 92 percent of preferred pharmacy claims in our sample are in chain pharmacies, and
the vast majority of independent pharmacies are non-preferred within plans that utilize preferred networks.
The outside option in our model is independent pharmacies, which are normalized to have a utility of zero.
Thus, δi jy captures consumer preferences for chains among type-i enrollees in plan j, year y; δihy is the
average type-i enrollee’s utility at chain pharmacy h in year y, δiq captures general trends in chain pharmacy
on steering of enrollees across pharmacies. We focus on pharmacy contracting in this paper, but consider the broader impacts of
LIS enrollment on pricing to be an important avenue for future research.

30

utilization for type-i enrollees, π ICR
jhy is a dummy for pharmacy h being in plan j’s preferred network in year
y, and εi jhq is an idiosyncratic error term assumed to be i.i.d. Type 1 extreme value. Allowing enrollees
in different geographic markets to have flexibly different preferences over pharmacy chains is analogous
c – a separate “preferred” pharmacy
to estimating a distance coefficient. The coefficient of interest is βl(i)

preference coefficient for each enrollee type l(i) capturing type-i enrollees’ quintile of lagged drug costs
interacted with LIS status. In some specifications, we instead let πiICR
jhy be average out-of-pocket cost for
enrollee type i in combination jhy in the initial coverage phase – this captures a similar mechanism as the
preferred dummy, but in principle allows us to examine whether price-sensitivity depends on preferred status
per se versus intensive margin variation in copay differentials.
The model predicts pharmacy shares, which we aggregate to the enrollee type-plan-quarter (market)
level. In reality, enrollees may visit multiple pharmacies in a given quarter; aggregation across consumers
within each market allows for this feature. Similar to Berry (1994), we estimate the following equation:


c
log si jhq − log (si j0q ) = δi jy + δihy + δiq + π ICR
jhy βl(i) .

Identification of preferences relies on variation in choice sets and preferred network coverage across markets.
The preferred dummy and copay coefficients are identified using variation in networks/copays for the same
pharmacies across plans, and are allowed to vary with enrollees’ ex ante drug needs and LIS subsidy status.
We assume no selection across plans in enrollees’ unobservable preferences for specific pharmacies. Finally,
we estimate this regression for 2012-2014 only, given that we do not observe lagged enrollee costs for 2011
enrollees.30
The pharmacy demand sample is summarized in Table 7. The average enrollee-year chose from 60
pharmacies in 8 retail chains. 63 percent of non-LIS enrollees were in preferred-network plans, versus only
32 percent of LIS enrollees; within preferred-network plans, 61 percent of non-LIS claims in retail chains
went to preferred pharmacies, versus only 38 percent for LIS claims. Out-of-pocket cost per day supply in
the initial coverage phase was 43 cents for non-LIS enrollees, versus 8 cents for LIS enrollees.31
30 We

also estimated specifications in which we instrumented for contemporaneous preferred network status using changes in
network status within plan over time. This strategy addresses potential endogeneity due to selection – enrollees may choose a plan
based on preferred network status of their favored local pharmacies, but not based on anticipated changes in preferred status of
those pharmacies. Those specifications yield qualitatively similar results; see Table 14 in the Appendix for details.
31 This variable is calculated as the weighted average enrollee out-of-pocket price per day supply for each enrollee type-planpharmacy chain-year. Only 30-day supplies of prescriptions filled in the initial coverage range – the coverage phase for which plan
cost-sharing is most relevant – are included in this calculation. Prices for different drugs are weighted using aggregate consumption
weights for the enrollee type (LIS-age-lagged cost quintile)-year.

We use the model of pharmacy demand to predict counterfactual demand patterns and to construct a
measure of consumer utility from a given plan-year’s pharmacy network and copay structure Gjy . Following
the existing literature (e.g., Town & Vistnes (2001), Capps et al. (2003), Ho et al. (2017), among others), we
measure enrollee type i’s willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a given network; we then aggregate across types to
our groups l(i) defined by lagged cost quintile and LIS status using observed enrollment weights piy :

Note that we estimate pharmacy demand conditional on the enrollee filling a prescription at a retail pharmacy, and we implicitly assume that the probability of any retail pharmacy claim is exogenous and constant
across networks. Appendix A describes how we incorporate the pharmacy demand estimates into a model
of enrollees choosing among Part D plans, and briefly summarizes the results.

5.2

Pharmacy Demand Estimates

Demand estimates are presented in Table 8 below. We focus on variation in coefficients with enrollees’
LIS status and lagged pharmacy cost quintile. Table 13 in the Appendix presents alternative fixed effect
specifications and samples; the results are similar in magnitude and direction.32
Several interesting patterns emerge. First, preferred network status (the first row in each panel) has a
32 Our

baseline specification includes fixed effects for each type-i interacted with plan-year, pharmacy-year, and quarter-year
fixed effects. Table 13 in the Appendix shows the results of a specification with fixed effects for each type-i interacted with plan,
pharmacy, and quarter-year fixed effects, for the full sample and for enrollees in preferred-network plans only. The qualitative
patterns are similar across all specifications – non-LIS enrollees are more sensitive to the preferred dummy and out-of-pocket cost
per day supply than LIS enrollees, and high-cost enrollees tend to be more sensitive than low-cost enrollees. However, the alternative
specification estimated within preferred-network plans only is more similar to our baseline results in magnitudes, suggesting that
enrollees’ preferences over pharmacies vary over time and particularly with plans’ preferred network status.

32

strong positive effect on demand for all non-LIS enrollees. Second, LIS enrollees – who are not exposed
to preferred network copay differentials, other than for tier 1 generic drugs – are only about a quarter as
responsive.33 Third, very high-cost enrollees – whose marginal prices are less likely to vary by preferred
network status due to the catastrophic coverage phase covering 95 percent of drug costs – are significantly
less responsive than low-cost enrollees within both LIS and non-LIS groups. To put these numbers in
perspective, note that preferred chain pharmacies have a market share of 49 percent among non-LIS enrollees
(versus 22 percent among LIS enrollees). Making all pharmacies non-preferred would decrease preferred
pharmacies’ market share in preferred network plans by 8.0 percentage points (or 16 percent) among nonLIS enrollees, versus 1.4 percentage points (or 6 percent) among LIS enrollees.34 Thus, about 30 percent
of the gap between LIS and non-LIS enrollees’ reliance on preferred chain pharmacies can be attributed to
preferred status rather than other baseline differences in preferences, such as location or brand preference.
Finally, the coefficient on OOPC/Day exhibits the same comparative static across non-LIS and LIS enrollees
– non-LIS enrollees have a large negative and significant coefficient on out-of-pocket cost per day, while LIS
enrollees’ coefficient is in fact small and positive – but the comparative static across quintile of lagged cost is
non-monotonic. For both non-LIS and LIS enrollees, the coefficient on OOPC/Day is least negative for very
high-cost enrollees, but is highest for quintile 3. This reflects a key difference between the dummy variable
1{Pre f erred} and OOPC/Day: the latter varies across enrollees based on the composition of the drugs
they tend to take. These results suggest that very low-cost enrollees tend to exhibit the strongest preference
for frequenting preferred pharmacies within preferred network plans, but that moderate-cost enrollees are
more sensitive than very low-cost enrollees to larger effective copay differentials between preferred and
non-preferred pharmacies.

5.3

Counterfactuals

To further understand what the results above mean for the costs and benefits of plans’ use of preferred
network contracting, we use the pharmacy demand estimates to simulate the spending impact of counterfactually making all pharmacies non-preferred. This counterfactual allows enrollees to re-sort across both chain
and independent retail pharmacies (the latter representing the outside option), then applies the observed retail and out-of-pocket prices for each pharmacy-plan pair to estimate spending impacts. This counterfactual

coefficient from a separate regression of demand dependent variable on Pre f erred dummy or

and lagged cost quintile.
is partial equilibrium, in that it does not account for any follow-on effect of comprehensive networks on
negotiated prices; we leave this analysis for future research.
The top panel of Table 9 shows baseline point-of-sale (POS) and out-of-pocket (OOP) costs, prices,
and utilization for non-LIS, LIS, and all enrollees in preferred network plans. POS and OOP prices are
pooled across all observed coverage phases, so that price differentials across preferred and non-preferred
pharmacies are muted due to the small or zero differentials present outside the initial coverage phase of the
Part D benefit.35 At baseline, non-LIS enrollees are much more likely than LIS enrollees to use preferred
retail pharmacies, perhaps due to the steering mechanism of interest or to other preferences, such as location;
recall that we allow preferences over pharmacies to vary flexibly with enrollee type and location. The pointof-sale price per 30 day supply is about 10 percent lower in preferred network pharmacies for both non-LIS
and LIS enrollees.
35 We estimated retail and point-of-sale prices for preferred and non-preferred pharmacies for each LIS-lagged cost quintileplan-year using regression analysis. Within each LIS-lagged cost quintile group, we regressed ln(price) on dummies for plan-year
interacted with pharmacy preferred status, as well as NDC fixed effects in order to purge any potential composition effects from the
price differences observed across pharmacies within plan. We then predicted POS and OOP price for each plan-year-LIS-lagged
cost quintile for the (weighted) mean NDC for the LIS-lagged cost quintile group.

Notes: Top panel reports baseline share of demand at preferred and non-preferred pharmacies,
baseline (observed) point-of-sale prices and spending, and baseline (observed) out-of-pocket prices
and spending, within preferred-network plans only. Excluded category is non-chain retail
pharmacies. Middle panel reports counterfactual shares, spending, and consumer surplus if all
pharmacies are counterfactually made preferred. Last panel reports counterfactual shares,
spending, and consumer surplus if all pharmacies are counterfactually made preferred and all
enrollees have Pre f erred dummy coefficient of non-LIS enrollees in lowest cost quintile.

35

We see strikingly different patterns when we turn to OOP costs. First, OOP cost per 30 day supply is an
order of magnitude smaller for LIS than non-LIS enrollees, as expected given the substantial cost-sharing
subsidies available to LIS enrollees. Second, non-LIS enrollees pay $4.30 lower copays on average (a 14
percent discount) at preferred pharmacies. In contrast, for the average drug we observe no preferred copay
discount for LIS enrollees (though this average conceals heterogeneity across drugs in different formulary
tiers).
The next panel of Table 9 shows the results of the first counterfactual, in which we simulate the effects of
making all preferred pharmacies non-preferred. This decreases the (previously) preferred pharmacy share
among non-LIS enrollees by 8.0 percentage points, versus just 1.4 percentage points for LIS enrollees.
Given the observed point-of-sale price differentials between preferred and non-preferred pharmacies, this
in turn translates into a 1.7 percent increase in average POS price for non-LIS enrollees, versus 0.2 percent
for LIS. Applying this simulated percentage change in point-of-sale price to baseline spending, the implied
spending impact of the counterfactual is small: $12 per non-LIS enrollee-year and $3 per LIS enrollee-year.
However, scaling these estimates by the 1.08 million non-LIS and 519,000 LIS enrollee-years in our 20122014 sample of preferred network enrollees using chain retail pharmacies, and by a factor of 10 to account
for this being a 10 percent sample, the cost implications of this counterfactual are $147 million over three
years.36
Our pharmacy demand analysis showed that preferred network sensitivity is stronger for non-LIS enrollees, and varies meaningfully across enrollees with different spending histories. We next estimate the
spending impact of an alternative counterfactual in which all enrollees are given the preferred network coefficient of non-LIS, low-cost enrollees; this is shown in the last panel of Table 9. This increases the cost
implications of the counterfactual to $15 per enrollee-year, or $239 million over three years.37
Framed differently, these counterfactuals illustrate the cost savings predicted by the model that are driven
by steering of enrollees across pharmacies, taking network status, point-of-sale prices, and out-of-pocket
prices as given. The counterfactual suggest that savings are modest relative to overall spending, but large
when aggregated across a large number of enrollees. Of course, we must consider both the costs and benefits
36 Note that the calculated dollar savings per enrollee-year is not equivalent to what we see if we multiply the average estimated
price change by average total spending at baseline, because the POS price effect of the counterfactual was calculated and applied
to enrollee spending for each plan-LIS-lagged cost quintile before calculating the weighted average dollar spending effect shown.
37 While this analysis is quite out-of-sample and thus only suggestive, it implies that small tweaks to plan design would increase
savings significantly. For example, copay differentials between preferred and non-preferred pharmacies could be flat across benefit
phases and drug tiers, within LIS status – this would have limited effect on actuarial value or the value of LIS subsidies, but would
increase plans’ ability to steer enrollees.

36

of restrictive contracting. Accordingly, the last row in each panel of Table 9 shows the estimated effect of
the counterfactual on estimated ex ante consumer surplus, given the plan demand results described in the
Appendix and specifically enrollees’ willingness to pay higher premiums for more comprehensive preferred
networks. These results indicate that, when preferred pharmacies are made non-preferred within preferrednetwork plans, all else equal, consumer surplus decreases by $23.8 per year for non-LIS enrollees, versus
only $1.5 for LIS enrollees, for an average consumer surplus impact of $16 per enrollee-year. That is, the
consumer surplus benefit of comprehensive networks is nearly double the cost savings achieve by enrollee
steering.
These results raise the question of why insurers offer limited network plans if the cost savings is significantly less than the value of expanded access? We believe three features of this market can explain the
discrepancy. First, similar to Shepard (2016), we found that limited network plans attract healthier enrollees;
plans could use network breadth as a screening tool. Second, limited pharmacy network plans are a relatively recent phenomenon (Snook & Filipek (2011)). Thus, insurers may be experimenting, and the market
may not be in equilibrium during our sample period. Finally, the threat of exclusion may allow insurers to
negotiate larger discounts within pharmacy, as discussed in our reduced form results.38

6 Conclusion
The rise of narrow pharmacy networks in commercial and public prescription drug insurance markets
raises important questions about health care costs and consumer welfare. This paper provides the first
evidence on the cost and welfare implications of selective pharmacy contracting.
We use both reduced-form, quasi-experimental evidence and structural demand analysis to illustrate
three key insights. First, most unsubsidized enrollees are highly sensitive to copay differentials between
preferred and non-preferred pharmacies; as a result, preferred network contracting yields small, but significant drug cost savings. Second, subsidized LIS enrollees and very high-spending enrollees are much less
responsive to preferred pharmacy status, which is a limiting factor on the savings due to selective pharmacy
contracting.39 Third, enrollees are sensitive to network generosity when choosing their prescription drug
38 The third feature above suggests the value of estimating the supply side in this setting; the second feature urges caution in
doing so.
39 The positive effects of subsidized low-income enrollees on the prices paid in the Part D program are not novel or unexpected
(see, e.g., Duggan & Scott Morton (2006) regarding similar spillover effects from the Medicaid program). However, the results do
suggest that simple tweaks to subsidy design would yield further savings; e.g., the small copay differentials borne by LIS enrollees

37

insurance plans, and revealed preference plan demand estimates suggest that the consumer surplus losses
from restrictive preferred pharmacy networks exceed the cost savings.
The setting considered in this paper presents perhaps a best-case scenario for analyzing the welfare
trade-offs inherent in selective contracting: prescription drug needs are more predictable than, say, the need
for inpatient hospital care; and frequent, repeated interaction with retail pharmacies implies that enrollees
are likely aware at the plan choice stage of the relative convenience and cost of nearby pharmacies. However, we note several fruitful areas to extend this research. First, our reduced form evidence suggested
that renegotiation is a significant source of savings due to restrictive preferred networks, but the high degree of network exclusion and presence of multiple network tiers we document introduce complications for
structural analysis. Second, an important feature of this environment is that retail pharmacies sell many
consumer products other than prescription drugs, and exclusion from a plan’s preferred network or overall
network likely has a large impact on consumer product sales as well. This may be an important consideration
for insurer-pharmacy bargaining..

for tier one drugs could be applied evenly to all drug tiers, improving steering without significantly undermining the generosity of
LIS subsidies.

Plan Demand

We flexibly estimate Medicare Part D plan demand using a logit model that allows preference parameters
to vary with LIS status and lagged drug spending quintile. A consumer’s choice set is defined at the PDP
region level and a product is a plan-region-specific insurance contract (contract-plan ID combination). For
each enrollee type l(i) defined by LIS status and lagged spending quintile, consumer utility for plan j in
market m and year y is given by:
p
x
pDjmy + αl(i)
W T Pl(i) jy + ξl(i) jmt + εi jmt ,
ul(i) jmy = ξl(i) j + αl(i)

(1)

where ξl(i) j are time-invariant, vertical plan characteristics (i.e., insurer fixed effects) that vary across consumer types, pDjmy is the plan premium (in hundreds of dollars per year), W T Pl(i) jy provides a measure
of (potentially type-l(i)-specific) pharmacy network breadth, and ξl(i) jmt represents time varying shocks to
unobservable vertical plan characteristics.
The outside option is Medicare Advantage plans. This model is consistent with consumers choosing a
plan before they realize the exogenously given need to fill a prescription. Our measures of network generosity include details on preferred network comprehensiveness across plans and enrollee types; combined with
insurer fixed effects, these capture plan generosity. The predicted probability that a consumer chooses plan
j in year y is given by:
σl(i) jmy =

exp uel(i) jmy



∑k∈Jmy exp uel(i)kmy

,

where Jmy is the set of all available plans in market m, which we define by enrollee ZIP code, in year y.
The plan demand sample is reported in Table 10. The average sample enrollee-year involved a choice from
among 27 plans. The average non-LIS enrollee chose a plan with annual premium of $506, versus $28 for
LIS enrollees. The Table highlights how the two measures of network generosity capture different variation.
Specifically, %Pre f erred is an aggregate measure defined for each plan-Part D region-year, regardless of
enrollee type. It also treats preferred and non-preferred network plans quite differently – for non-preferred
network plans, all pharmacies are preferred, so %Pre f erred captures overall network size; whereas for preferred network plans, %Pre f erred does not increase with the overall size of the network, conditional on the
preferred network size. In contrast, W T P combines enrollee type-specific preferences over local in-network
pharmacies with enrollee-type-specific preferences for preferred pharmacies. Thus, while %Pre f erred and

W T P are positively correlated, we do not expect them to necessarily impact enrollment in the same way.
Non-LIS enrollees were more likely to enroll in preferred-network plans, so that the average chosen plan’s
%Pre f erred was 48 percent, versus 67 percent for LIS enrollees. However, non-LIS enrollees chose plans
with greater overall network comprehensiveness on average: the average W T P measure of plan network
generosity was 1.7 for non-LIS enrollees, versus 0.51 for LIS enrollees.
The coefficients are identified from variation in choice sets, within-issuer variation in premiums across
markets, and consumer type and geographic variation in the measure of WTP, respectively. We assume that
the insurer fixed effects capture a great deal of unobserved product variation that may be correlated with
either premiums or WTP.
Our estimates will be biased if ξl(i) jmy is correlated with premiums or product characteristics. We address
this issue via a two-pronged approach. First, we insurer fixed effects, ξl(i) j , that are allowed to vary with
consumer type: the unobserved product characteristic is the deviation from the plan mean for the LIS-cost
quintile group in question. Second, we instrument for premiums. As is common in this setting, we use
Hausman-style instruments: we instrument for the premium for a given insurer-market-consumer type-year
using the average premium for the same insurer-consumer type-year in all other PDP regions.
In some specifications, we show results where network comprehensiveness is characterized as in our
reduced form results: as the percent of local pharmacies preferred in the Part D region. However, in the
specifications we use for our counterfactual analysis in the main text, we rely on results where network
comprehensiveness is characterized by the W T P measure resulting from our pharmacy demand regressions.
The former are shown for each LIS-cost group in Figure 7; the latter are shown in Figure 8. The premium
coefficient estimates (top two panels in each figure) are quite similar across specifications. We observe that
LIS enrollees are more sensitive to variation in their effective (post-subsidy) premiums than are non-LIS
enrollees; this is not unexpected given the tendency of low-income individuals to be highly price-sensitive,
but we note that LIS enrollees’ premium coefficients are noisier than non-LIS enrollees’ given the limited
44

variation in LIS enrollee premiums. Within non-LIS enrollees, higher-cost enrollees are also less sensitive
to premium than lower-cost enrollees; this is likely due to the greater total insured benefit for higher-cost
enrollees.

The estimates regarding enrollees’ value for network comprehensiveness (bottom two panels in each

pay more for plans with greater network coverage. Second, the coefficients are much larger for %Pre f erred

appear to have a stronger positive preference for network generosity than non-LIS enrollees within each
measure. At first glance it may seem surprising that LIS enrollees value comprehensive networks, given
that they are not subject to most preferred-pharmacy copay differentials. However, LIS enrollees may have
a strong preference for overall network size, which is also embodied in these measures. Finally, the clear
positive gradient of the preference for %Pre f erred in cost quintile is not present in the W T P results. This
likely reflects the net effects of high- versus low-cost enrollees’ different ex post demand for pharmacies
conditional on filling a prescription, and high- versus low-cost enrollees’ different ex ante value for compre-

46

hensive networks.
We estimate pooled coefficients within non-LIS and LIS enrollees for the specifications we take to the
counterfactual analysis in the main text. These results are summarized in Table 11. For each group as
defined by LIS status, we show results for several different specifications of controls: columns (1), (4), and
(7) include contract-LIS-lagged cost quintile fixed effects; columns (2), (5), and (8) add in year-LIS-lagged
cost quintile fixed effects; and columns (3), (6), and (9) add in ZIP-LIS-lagged cost quintile fixed effects. The
top panel shows results with %Pre f erred as the network generosity variable; the bottom panel shows results
with W T P as the network variable. The premium coefficients are generally quite stable with respect to the
fixed effects specification employed, as are the coefficients on %Pre f erred. However, the coefficients on
W T P are more sensitive: the controls for ZIP are necessary to ensure a positive coefficient, likely reflecting
the fact that network generosity for a given insurer can vary dramatically across local geographic regions.
In order to quantify the trade-offs between limited pharmacy access and cost control, we must quantify
enrollee preferences over network breadth in dollar terms. For any enrollee type i, this object Vi can be
calculated as
Vi =

αix
∗ 100.
αip

(2)

This measure calculates the ex ante tradeoff between one unit of network generosity and one dollar in annual
premiums. Our preferred specification uses the results in columns (3) and (6) in Table 11, which imply that
non-LIS enrollees are willing to pay $102 in additional annual premiums for a unit increase in network
generosity (approximately a standard deviation), whereas LIS enrollees are willing to pay only $39 for a
unit increase in network generosity.

The disagreement payoff from the non-preferred network stage is based on out-of-network status, so the
negotiated price maximizes the Nash product of pharmacy h’s and plan j’s gains from in-network status.

Here, the negotiated price maximizes the Nash product of pharmacy h’s and plan j’s gains from moving
from non-preferred to preferred status.
The entire price negotiation occurs simultaneously for each pair h j, so that in the event of bargaining
breakdown in either stage, all other preferred-network pairs G pre f \ h j, non-preferred network pairs G \
(G pre f ∩ h j), and prices p−hj ≡ p \ ph j are assumed to be held fixed in pair h j’s disagreement payoffs at
each stage.
For the sake of brevity, all arguments are dropped from the notation in the following. For any general

Each of these terms is intuitive, mirroring the results regarding hospital-insurer networks in Ho & Lee
(2017). Consider first the payments to a non-preferred pair, D0h j pnp∗
h j . A plan’s ability to extract higher
rents (i.e., lower retail prices) in negotiating with a given pharmacy is increasing in its relative bargaining power γ and decreasing in: the pharmacy’s ability to “recapture” profits from enrollment in other
plans ∑k∈Gh \ j [∆0h j D0hk ](phk − w) if h j is out of network; in the extent to which the plan loses premium
revenue by dropping that pharmacy from its network entirely R j [∆0h j s0j ] (the “premium” effect); and in a
“price reinforcement effect” ∑n∈G j \h [∆0h j D0n j ](pn j − cn j ) that reflects the strategic complementarity of other
pharmacies’ prices in the current negotiation. We arrive at a similar expression for the preferred network
solution, in which the difference in total payments between preferred and non-preferred network status
f∗
Dh j phpre
− D0h j pnp∗

h j is a function of all the same terms, but each effect is defined for a switch from pre-

ferred to non-preferred status, rather than from non-preferred status to out-of-network status. We can furf∗
pre f ∗

ther split the term Dh j phpre

h j into a price effect and a quantity effect: Dh j ph j
hj =
f∗
np∗
0
Dh j (phpre
− pnp∗
j
h j ) + (Dh j − Dh j )ph j . This allows us to express the solution in terms of the preferred net-

work price discount:

hj .

n∈G j \h

This includes the wholesale cost, recapture, premium and enrollment, and reinforcement effects above,
42
plus a “preferred capture” effect (Dh j − D0h j )pnp∗
hj .
42 The Nash-in-Nash framework considered in this model is simple and tractable, but has difficulty accommodating the key
feature of the setting – that preferred networks are observed to be highly restrictive. In future work, we draw on recent work that
endogenizes network formation to estimate a model of bargaining between plans and pharmacies allowing for equilibrium exclusion
(see, e.g., Ho & Lee (2018), Ghili (2018), Liebman (2018)).
