    "abstract": "\n\nWe offer new evidence on the regional dynamics of wealth holding in the United States over the Civil War decade based on a hand-linked random sample of wealth holders drawn from the 1860 census.  Despite the wealth shock caused by emancipation, we find that patterns of wealth mobility were broadly similar for northern and southern residents in 1860.  Looking at the determinants of individual wealth holding in 1870, we find that the elasticity with respect to 1860 wealth was quite low in both regions\u2014consistent with high levels of wealth mobility.\n\n",
    "acknowledgement": "\nCompletion of this project was made possible by the efforts of three excellent undergraduate research assistants, Leah Greteman,  Skyler Schneekloth, Catherine Thompson, who compiled the linked data sample.  Schneekloth provided further assistance with processing and analyzing the linked data.  We have also received helpful input from participants in the Iowa State University Labor-Public Economics workshop and the Western Washington University Economics discussion group.
