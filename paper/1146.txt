LIFE-CYCLES IN INCOME AND WEALTH
ABSTRACT
Using panel data for a sample of households in Utah from 1850 to
1900 we find income and wealth age profiles that are concave and that

have a peak within the age distribution of the relevant sample. This
finding holds for cross sections at five-year intervals, for pooled
cross section time—series data, for cohort data, for households when
individual differences are accounted for with a variance-components
model and when we account for vintage measured as duration within the
economy.

We also find a relationship between age-income and age-wealth
profiles that is consistent with a life-cycle model of consumption given

a concave and peaked age-income profile: households accumulate and then
begin to draw down wealth holdings, the age-wealth profile consistently
peaks at an age later than the age-income profile for the same

households, and the age-wealth profile for young households is
considerably steeper than is the age-income profile.

We have data, then, that in many respects appear to be capable of
having been generated by individual decisions in a contemporary economy.

This is particularly interesting since the data were, in fact, generated
within a very different economy, one where formal education, on-the-job
training and labor—leisure choices were probably considerably less
important than in a contemporary economy.

It is generally accepted that individual decisions and, hence,
observed outcomes at any moment, reflect time horizons that extend

beyond the present. Indeed, the notion that there are life-cycle
considerations involved in particular decisions and, consequently, in
observable outcomes has influenced much of modern economics, both micro

and macro. Given a patterned life-cycle in income, specific patterns of
consumption, human and nonhuman wealth accumulation, demographic choice,

mobility, etc., may follow. Two general questions are of interest: Why
should there be a patterned life-cycle in income? And second, are the
patterns in consumption, wealth accumulation, demographic choice,

mobility, etc., consistent with a given life-cycle pattern in income and
optimizing individual or household behavior?

In this paper we touch on elements of both of these questions. We
first use data from an extended panel (Utah, from 1850 to 1900) to

demonstrate the robustness and pervasive nature of stylized life—cycle
patterns in important economic variables across time, economic

development and, to some degree, across cultures. This descriptive
section is followed by a consideration of the consistency of wealth

accumulation patterns with given life-cycle patterns in income. We then
consider the consistency of our data with the leading models of

life-cycle income patterns. Finally, we consider the role of rents in
life-cycle behavior. While we hope that the results are interesting in
their own right, our interests go beyond the particular issues of this

paper to the nature of the mechanism that generates the distribution of

economic rewards. We turn to this larger issue in a concluding section.

While notions of life-cycle individual behavior pervasively
influence much thinking about economic issues, the evidence for
life-cycle patterns in important economic attributes of households is

less pervasive and, in many respects, ambiguous. There are a fairly
large number of studies of age-income patterns, over cross sections,
with cohort data and more recently using panels of individual data.
These include descriptive efforts and more narrowly focused uses of
particular data sets to test models of age-income profiles, usually some

variant of a human capital model. The latter group of studies usually
assumes that there is an age-income pattern that needs explanation and

rationalization. Studies seeking evidence of such patterns include
those of Swedish data (Greedy, Hart, Jonsson, and Klevmarken, 1980),
British data (Creedy and Hart, 1979; Lydall, 1955), Dutch data (Ease,
1970), and U.S. data (Fisher, 1952; Miller, 1964; Heckman, 1976; Weiss

and Lillard, 1978). There are fewer contemporary studies of age-wealth
patterns but more of an historical nature. These include those for
British data (Lydall, 1955; Shorrocks, 1975), and U.S. data (Jones,
1980; Soltow, 1975; Atack and Bateman, 1980; Mirer, 1979; Smith, 1975;

Lampman, 1962; Projector and Weiss, 1966). Only a handful of studies
consider age-income and age-wealth profiles for the same group of
individuals (Lydall, 1955; King and Dicks-Mireaux, 1981; Projector and
Weiss, 1966), and we know of only one study of age-income and
age-consumption patterns for the same group of individuals (Ghez, 1975).
Three separate effects are potentially present in observations that
combine age with either wealth or income observations for an individual:

the effects of age, vintage, and economic growth. The accumulation and

3

depreciation of human capital, the aging process with its physical and
mental effects and the choices the individuals make about labor and
leisure occurring over time are, hence, age related and may impart a

life-cycle to the income profile. A desire to smooth consumption
relative to fluctuations in income, from any of these sources or from
transitory stochastic shocks, and bequest motives may then create an

age-wealth profile. Unfortunately, these effects of age upon income and
wealth are often confounded by the two other effects, vintage and

economic growth. There is a vintage effect in that each cohort starts
from a different economic position due to the context of the economy
when that cohort enters the labor force as well as the state of
knowledge when a particular cohort concentrates on the accumulation of

human capital. Finally, there is an economic growth effect that may
shift the age-income profile upward. Since age, vintage and growth are
all related to the passage of time, they are often tightly intermingled
and it is difficult to isolate the effect of age alone upon income and
wealth independent of growth and vintage.
Cross-sectional observations on age and income confound the effects
of age and of vintage since age and vintage tend to be closely

correlated. Typically, cross-sectional age-income profiles display a
hump shape with a peak in income in middle age. The 1947 cross section
described by Fisher (1952) shows a peak income in the 35-44 age grou,
although the mean income of the 45-64 age group is nearly as high. A
1950 cross section drawn from census data by Miller (1965) peaks in the

45-54 age group while a cross section drawn from the 1960 census peaks

earlier with the 35-44 age group. Lydall (1955) finds similar patterns
for Great Britain. Household income peaks in the 35-44 age group for a

4

survey of British households in 1953. Creedy et al. (1981) find a
cross-sectional peak in the forties in the Swedish data.

Earnings as well as income display a concave age profile. Ruggles
and Ruggles (1977) show peaks in earnings from age 40 to 50 for
cross-sectional earnings profiles from 1957 to 1969 using a sample drawn

from Social Security records. Lydall (1955) finds an earlier earnings
peak for British workers, the peak occurring in the 35—44 age group.
For estimated relationships (usually using a quadratic in age and log
earnings) using males from the 1960 census the peak occurs near age 50.
Heckman (1976) estimates an equation with data for males with some
college education which suggests that the age-earnings profile of

educated or skilled workers may peak somewhat later. Lydall (1955)
finds this to be the case for British workers.
This is certainly not an exhaustive survey but it gives the flavor

of the results in a number of studies and strongly suggests a concave
relationship between income or earnings and age that has a peak for ages
well within the range of ages of the samples and population from which

they are drawn. As we detail later, comparable inferences can be made
from our data.

While there is a fairly consistent set of results for the
age-income profile, particularly concerning concavity in age, the

cross—sectional relationship between age and wealth is less clear. In
general, historical cross sections of wealth yield peaked concave
profiles while cross sections that utilize more contemporary data

generate more ambiguous results. Alice H. Jones (1981) found both net
worth and total wealth peaked in the 55-64 age group for New England in

1774. Similar results were found for the Middle Colonies. Soltow

5

(1975) does not find a peak for wealth in his study of wealth drawn from

the mid-nineteenth century censuses. However, Atack and Bateman (1980)
do find an age peak in a sample of data drawn from the same censuses.
Total wealth appears to peak at about 55 years of age in their data with
the peak implied by their regressions (which include other variables
besides age and age squared such as race, occupation and birthplace) at

about 63 years of age. Lydall (1955) finds that total wealth peaks in
the 45-54 age group for British households in 1953 while net worth peaks

in the 55-64 age group. Most studies utilizing contemporary data do not
find either concavity in age nor a peak in wealth holdings for any age

within the age spread for the sample or population. Lampman (1962)
finds that the size of estates increases with age for males who are

among the top wealth holders. Smith (1975) allows for age categories in
a regression analysis of log wealth for household estates in Washington,

D.C. in 1967. He finds that there is an increasing relationship between

age and wealth even beyond age 80. Projector and Weiss (1966), who have
data on both income and wealth, regress 109 wealth on log income, age,
employment, and inheritance status and find wealth to be positively
correlated with age when these other independent variables are included.
The simple mean of wealth, however, peaks within the 55-64 age group.
Again, while not an exhaustive survey of age-wealth studies, these
studies do give a flavor of the results--the evidence for a concave

relationship in age and far one that peaks is mixed. Failure to at
least find concavity is a puzzle. The continuous rise in wealth with
age does not fit well with life-cycle theories of consumption and
savings nor does it fit well with the evidence on age-income profiles.
(With regards to life-cycle consumption theories, Ghez finds that

6

consumption and income cross between age 50 and 60 which would suggest

declining wealth beyond that age.) Extending the considerations to
include bequest motives and risk aversion in the uncertainty about the
age of death do not really make a monotonic relationship between wealth

and age plausible. It is of some comfort that the adjustment for
differential mortality rates by Shorrocks (1975) and an examination of
the ratio of wealth to permanent income by King and Dicks-Mireaux (1981)
reintroduces a peaked, concave age-wealth profile in contemporary data.
As noted below, the Utah data display a clearly concave age-wealth

relationship for cross—sectional samples from 1850, 1860, and 1870. For
the latter two cross sections there is a peak in wealth holdings for
ages between 55 and 60 which is essentially independent of the

specification. This result is consistent with most historical samples.
It is possible that the differences between historical and contemporary
age-wealth patterns is attributable to the failure to account for the
rise of pensions as an important component in contemporary wealth
hol dings.

There is now a widespread dissatisfaction with the usage of
cross-sectional data for analysis of the sort we have discussed due to

the confounding of age and vintage or cohort effects. This
dissatisfaction has led to the belief that the age-wealth or age-income
relationships should be studied from the vantage point of cohorts rather

than cross sections. However, the supposed dominance of cohort data for
these purposes is not clear-—cohort profiles confound the effects of age

and economic growth. As Weiss and Lillard (1979) point out, there is a
fundamental identification problem in disentangling the effects of age,

vintage, and growth. Cohort data are not immune to the problem. While

7

one would like to observe the effect of age independent of both vintage

or cohort effects and growth effects, neither cross section nor cohort

data allow for these observations. However, cohort data do allow the
researcher to examine lifetime earnings or income. There have been some
more sophisticated attempts to disentangle the effects of age, time, and
vintage using these kinds of data, notably those studies of Creedy
et al. (1979), Weiss and Lillard (1979), and Ease (1970).
Cohort data seem to support the proposition that income or earnings

rise with age but at a declining rate of growth. Ruggles and Ruggles
(1977) found that cohorts born successively later have steeper earnings

profiles for the 1957-69 period. Miller found that incomes grew with
age in cohorts observed between 1950 and 1960 except for the group who

were 55-64 in 1950 and therefore beyond retirement in 1960. He also
found that the rate of growth of income was higher for the younger age

groups. Lansing and Sonquist also examine the average (median in their
case) income by cohort and its changes over time. They generally find
income rising with age but possibly peaking around sixty. They find the
rate of growth of income to be most rapid during the younger years. For
example, college graduates who were about 21 in 1950 had a fourfold
increase in real income from 1949 to 1965 while college graduates who
were 40 in 1950 had less than a twofold increase over the same period.

Ease (1970) estimates the cohort peak to be around 50 years of age for
professions such as physician and lawyer for a no-growth regime.

Cohort data on wealth show little evidence of concavity and peaking
of wealth in the life-cycle and thus do little to dispel the behavioral

puzzle noted earlier. Shorrocks (1975) finds that wealth increases with
age throughout the life span until an adjustment is made for the

8

differential mortality rates by wealth level. Mirer (1979) finds that
wealth increases with age. Lansing and Sonquist (1969), however, find
that wealth increases only through age 60 to 65 and then declines. It
should be reemphasized that cohort measures of income and wealth

confound growth effects with age effects. There is no particular reason
to accept that a particular cohort age-income profile reveals more about
the life-cycle than a particular cross-sectional profile since each
mixes the effect of age with another effect--either growth or vintage.
We have alluded to age-income and age-wealth patterns in the Utah

data. We now consider those patterns more carefully and systematically.
We observe income and a set of household characteristics for a
series of cross sections extending over a 45-year period, 1855 to 1900.
In Table 1.1 we provide the descriptive statistics for each of these
cross sections together with those cross sections where we observe

wealth and a set of household characteristics for a 20-year period from
1850 to 1870.

In addition to wealth holdings and income estimates in selected

years, we also observe the birth year of the individual and hence age
(A); year of entrance into the Utah economy or the first vital statistic
in Utah (1); birthplace, which we group into U.S. born (USB) and foreign
born (FB); place of residence for each wealth or income observation

which we have categorized into three geographical rings around Salt Lake
City (U, Ri, R2); occupations in the four census years from 1850 to 1880

which we first coded in a manner roughly consistent with modern census

classifications and then grouped into five categories: farm (F), crafts
(C), service (S), common labor (L), and white—collar or professional
(W).

9
From Table 1.1 it is clear that our data (about 10,000 households
are included) were drawn so that the average age increases with time,

from 36 to 67 over the 45-year period. Over half of the sample is
foreign born, reflecting the strong immigrant nature of the economy

during this period. Well over half of the sample is farming with 15 to
20 percent employed in the crafts and 13 to 15 percent generally

employed as common laborers. White-collar and service occupations split
the remaining share. We have created a panel of individuals from these
cross sections by linking individuals across the time intervals between

observations. This desire to create a panel is one of the reasons the
average age increases with time since we were interested in individuals

we could trace for extended periods. We have, however, sampled younger
individuals in the later years so that we can observe new household

formations. In addition, we have linked individuals into families,
creating a large sample of brothers and fathers/sons/grandsons.

This

linking effort also brings some younger individuals into the sample in
the later years.

Do these data exhibit a concave age-income profile or any other

systematic relationship between age and income? We allow for a
patterned relationship by including a quadratic in age in a series of

cross-sectional regressions where we also account for the effect of
other household characteristics, birthplace, area of current residence,
occupation held at last available census, time of entry into the economy
or "vintage" and, in alternative specifications, log wealth from the

last available census. Table 1.2 provides estimates of this simple
model for each of the cross sections from 1855 to 1900. We will

10

consider the effects of household characteristics later (Section IV) and
presently focus on the age-income relationship.

For these particular data, each cross section exhibits a pronounced

concavity in age. Indeed, in each cross section over nearly one-half
century, income peaks and then declines at an age well within the range

of ages in the population. This peak occurs between the late thirties
and mid-forties for each of these cross sections but does vary with the

cross section. However, there does not appear to be a systematic
relationship between the peak age and the maturing of the economy or the
average age of the samples, which, as indicated in Table 1.1, increases
substantially over the half—century.
We have selected a sample from 1870 for whom we observe both income
and wealth estimates in that year together with a set of household

characteristics. From that sample, we have drawn a subsample of
households whom we observe in each of the five-year intervals from 1870

to 1900. This allows us to compare age—income profiles within a cross
section and within a pooled longitudinal data set. Table 1.3 provides
estimates of the 1870 cross-sectional age-income relationship for a

variety of specifications. We note a pronounced, concave age-income
profile which peaks at an age within the spread of ages in the sample

and which is mostly unaffected by other household characteristics. On
the other hand, while the profile is pronounced and significant, it does
not account for much of the variance in log income over the sample.

Accounting for "vintage" in the sense of duration within the economy
doubles the explained variance and allowing for the effect of wealth
holdings on income more than doubles the explained variance again.

11

The effect of wealth on income ought to reflect the return on
wealth (since we are measuring income and not earnings) unless holding
wealth provides substantial advantages in the exploiting of one's skills

that are related to earnings. Because of the age—income profile, the
"return" on wealth varies, but at the point of means it is about

10 percent. We do not know what the effective market return for capital
was in this economy, but the estimate is certainly within a reasonable
range, by modern standards, and we conclude that the effect of wealth
was primarily reflected in a stream of returns it provided and not in
some additional advantage it provided for exploiting one's human
capital.

In Table 1.4 we provide pooled cross-sectional, time-series

estimates for a sample of individuals from the 1870 data whom we observe

for the following 30 years. The age-income profile does not explain
much of the variance in the log of incomes--nothing does--but in the
longitudinal data it does explain a good deal more than in the cross

section. However, again we find a pronounced life-cycle pattern across
time for a single group and not simply across ages at a single moment of

time. Indeed, the profiles are quite similar when we account for the
year-specific effects, with peaks at similar ages for comparable

specifications in the cross section. The implied return on wealth is
again about 10 percent.

The longitudinal data, while having a narrower age spread than the

cross section, still have a substantial spread in ages. It is possible
then that we are simply replicating the cross section in each year and
the age effect can be accounted for by the cross section.

Unfortunately, specific age cohorts are quite small in these data. Iks

12

an alternative, we have created a synthetic panel of data, selecting all
those between 18 and 24 (the average age in each °generation" is about
21) in each of the years we have a cross section—-1855, 61, 66, 70, 75,

80--and following them for either 20 or 30 years. We pool these
hgenerationsu into a panel of 20-year olds and then account for the

generation from which they come (but we have not controlled for the

variance of the year of observation). As Table 1.5 illustrates, we
again observe a pronounced age-income profile for these 20-year olds

over the next 20 or 30 years of their lives. The effects of the other
household characteristics have very much the same pattern as that

observed for either the cross sectional or panel of households. The

"generation dummies factor out growth and price change effects. Since
prices were likely either stable or declining slightly over much of this
period, the coefficients indicate substantial growth or vintage effects

for the generations. But since these have been accounted for, they
cannot be contributing to the age-income profile. For these data,
however, the peak in the age-income profile occurs at a younger age than

for either the cross-sectional or panel data. The ages are within the
range of the cross-sectional estimates over the entire period.
As we noted earlier, there is an identification problem which will
be reflected in an errors—in-variables bias in both the cross—sectional

and panel estimates. This makes the factoring out of the real

age-income relationship problematic. However, we have found a
relationship, concave in shape with a peak age between the late thirties
and mid-forties for 1) a variety of cross sections, 2) a panel of
households observed over a 30-year period, and 3) a synthetic panel of
20-year olds observed over either a 20- or 30-year period.

In addition,

13

we have found that other household characteristics, while important in
explaining incomes or households, do not much affect the age-income

profile. When such characteristics do affect the profile, it remains
concave.

II

The economy from which our data are drawn appears to generate a

pronounced age—income profile. Are individuals making optimal choices
about wealth holdings given these profiles? To answer that question we
would have to have data on individual inheritance, intended bequests,

and consumption patterns. Since these data are not available (and
unlikely, except perhaps for the first, to become available) we can only
consider the consistency of the observed behavior with the usually held

notions about life-cycle behavior. That is, we concern ourselves with
the consistency of aggregate patterns of wealth holdings with the
observed age-income profile.
If, as it is generally assumed, individuals have lifetime horizons

because they desire to smooth consumption relative to the given income
life—cycle, then, assuming that there is no net borrowing over an
individual's lifetime, 1) there should be a corresponding "life-cycle"
pattern in nonhuman wealth holdings that 2) is concave, 3) peaks at an
age later than that of the corresponding individual income life-cycle,

and 4) has a steeper slope than the income life-cycle over the range

where the income life-cycle is increasing. We illustrate possible
life-cycles in income and consumption and the implied life-cycle in
wealth in Figure 11.1.

It is possible, depending upon the consumption path, for wealth
accumulation to increase at an increasing rate at least until the peak

14

of the income path at which point it would assume a concave pattern.
Sizeable bequests (comparable, of course, to net lifetime borrowing) may

substantially alter the suggested implications noted above. For
example, with a large bequest, it would be possible for an individual to
consume more at each point in life than income would warrant, thus
continuously drawing down the stock of wealth from the day of the

bequest. A bequest motive would also alter the implied accumulation
path given the age-income profile. However, in this case we would
expect that the age—wealth pattern would be concave and if it peaked, to

peak at some age later than that of the age-income pattern. Both would
be consistent with the implications suggested above so that it is not

possible to test whether there is a bequest motive. It is possible that
bequest is the only motive for accumulation; if so, there need not be
consistency between income and wealth profiles since wealth is not being

used as a buffer against income variance. Thus, bequests or bequest
motives could lead to any pattern of wealth accumulation as could
individual behavior that was not concerned with lifetime horizons.
However, if we find in our data the elements suggested above, the
consistency of age-income and age—wealth profiles would provide support
for the life-cycle model of behavior and is, essentially, a weak test
for the life-cycle theory.

We impose essentially the same specification on log wealth as we
did on log income, allowing for concavity in age with a quadratic term.
We also allow for individual characteristics to affect wealth holdings.
We presently have three cross sections for wealth, those drawn from the

1850, 60, and 70 federal censuses. The data for 1850 only include
estimates of real wealth holdings, while those for 1860 and 1870 include

15

separate estimates of real and personal wealth. We use the log of total
wealth for those two years. Results are summarized in Table 11.1.
We do find an age-wealth profile in each of these cross sections.

For each, the profile is concave in age. Moreover, for each, the
profile peaks at an age within the range of ages within the particular
sample used--from 47 in 1850 to 50 in 1870.
In Table 11.2 we present estimates for a subsample of those we

observe in 1870 for whom we observe both income and wealth in 1870. The
data on income and wealth are drawn, however, from separate sources,
Mormon Church financial records and U.S. censuses, respectively.

We find, again, age-wealth profiles that are concave in age with

peaks at ages within the range of ages in the sample. Excluding or
including household characteristics does not change either of these

observations although different specifications change somewhat the slope

of the aggregate profile. Moreover, we find that the age—income
profile, in every case, peaks at an earlier age than that for the

age—wealth profile. Usually the age-income profile peaks in the
mid-forties while the age-wealth profile peaks in the mid-fifties.
Since this is not an economy with mandated or socially imposed
retirement, these relationships cannot result from externally imposed

decisions. Finally, we note that the implied increment in wealth from
aging one year is substantially above the implied increment in income in

dollar terms. Thus, the wealth profile is steeper in dollars than the
income profile over the range of increasing income with age. Each of
these observations indicates a remarkable consistency of these data with
individual behavior suggested by a life-cycle hypothesis for savings and
consumption, given that an individual confronts an age-income profile.

16

Moreover, there is nothing in the specification that forced these

results. That is, it is possible for the quadratic in age and wealth to
both peak earlier and have a flatter slope or to peak later and have a
flatter slope than the age-income profile even with wealth holdings
being substantially greater than income (the ratio obviously varies with
age in this economy, but the mean ratio is about 4 to 1).

III

We have ignored to this point individual characteristics other than

age. It is clear from the reported regressions that these
characteristics also affect individual income and individual wealth

holdings at least in cross sections. Thus one's place of birth, place
of residence and occupation all matter for both income and wealth

positions. Those living in rural areas have lower incomes and lower
wealth holdings than do comparable individuals living in the urban

county. This is also true for those employed in craft, service or
common labor occupations (when compared with farmers or with

white-collar professional workers). The pattern, both in terms of the
sign of the coefficient and the relative size of the elasticity, is
essentially the same for cross-sectional, pooled and cohort data
although the magnitude of the effects changes with the particular data

set. The pattern of signs is also the same for log income as it is for
log wealth. The major exception is for the foreign born--foreign born
have higher incomes than U.S. born but they have lower nonhuman wealth
holdings.

Duration within the economy or "vintage" is an important

determinant of both income and wealth positions. We have found no
evidence of concavity or convexity in income or wealth with respect to

17

duration. Nor have we found evidence of interaction between time of
entry and age. We find that duration simply shifts the age—income or
age-wealth profile upward so that those with more experience in the

economy have higher incomes and higher wealth holdings than those with

less experience. When an estimate of nonhuman wealth is included in the
specification, the effect of tvintagehl decreases sharply. In the

cross-section regression (Table 1.3) it falls from .035 to .019; in the

pooled regression (Table 1.4) it falls from .025 to 0. This suggests
that much 0f the effect of this type of hlvintageu is being capitalized

and may simply represent a classical Ricardian land rent.

While there are some simultaneity problems that we have not yet
adequately handled, it does appear that individual characteristics have

independent effects on income and wealth. Thus, when income is included
in the log wealth specification (Table 11.2) the explained variance
increases and some of the parameter estimates decrease, but we continue

to observe individual characteristics affecting wealth independent of

their effects on income. Conversely, when we include the log of wealth
in a log income specification, the elasticities generally decline,
indicating that the effects of household characteristics are

capitalized, but they do not decline to zero, indicating that the
effects are not fully capitalized in nonhuman wealth but retain
independent effects on the income stream of an individual.

Iv

We observe life-cycle age-income profiles and corresponding

consistent life-cycle age-wealth profiles. We also observe that
individual characteristics affect both income flows and wealth holdings.

Are these effects compensatory or do they represent ability, land or

18

other rents? Compensatory income flows, where lower incomes early in
the life-cycle are compensated for by higher incomes later, leaving the
discounted income streams unaffected for differing life-cycle paths, are
suggested by human capital models of behavior, particularly on-the-job

training models. Indeed, the existence of compensatory flows has come
to be viewed as a test of the on-the-job training models (c.f Hause,

1972; or Lillard and Weiss, 1979)—-the so—called slope-intercept°
tests. While these models are sometimes viewed as rationalizations of
age—income life-cycle profiles, the slope—intercept tests only examine

systematic individual deviations from a given age-income profile. We
return to this observation in our concluding remarks.
We have considered systematic deviations from a given age-income

profile for groups of individuals sharing common characteristics by
considering the interaction of some characteristics, specifically

occupation, with age. We have considered specifications that would
allow for differences in intercepts and slopes, thereby allowing for

compensatory differences for these aggregate groups. For log income we
find no important interaction effects. We cannot reject the hypothesis
that individuals with different occupations share a common slope in the

age-income profiles. At least at the aggregate level, the only
differences between individuals with different occupations are
differences in intercepts——the life-cycle itself appears, on this

evidence, not to systematically differ across characteristics. For log
wealth, as indicated in Table 11.2, the interaction effects are
significant so long as the intercepts are constrained to be the same at

age 0. This is consistent with intercept differences for income but
only if consumption does not change by the same amount as the income

19

"rent for the characteristic. On the other hand, the specifications in
columns 6 and 7 of Table 11.2 do not explain any more of the variance in

log wealth than do those in columns 5 and 8 of the same table. There
are slight differences, apparently, in the shapes of the age-wealth

profiles with characteristic differences but these differences are not
substantial.

Thus, we find no evidence of compensating differentials in
age—income profiles by characteristic groupings and no particularly
strong evidence for compensating differentials in age-wealth profiles

for the same characteristic groupings. Hence, occupational choices as a
whole do not compensate. Instead, we find something closer to a rent
model for choices of this sort. It may be that compensating differences
are always individually determined and hence masked by aggregation and
the consideration of mean differences by occupational groups.

We have allowed for individual differences by using a very simple
variance components specification where individual differences are

allowed intercepts alone. That is,
log y..

This is a so-called 'fixed effects° model for both individuals and

years. Again we find, allowing for individual differences, a pronounced
age—income profile that is concave with a peak age of 53. Hence, the

20

observed life-cycle is not the outcome of aggregation over individual
differences but is independent of those differences.

V Concluding Remarks
We have data that in many respects appear to be capable of having
been generated by individual decisions within a contemporary economy.

This is particularly so for the concavity and peak in the age-income
profile and perhaps for the age-wealth profile as well.

It is also

apparent in the consistency between the actual age—wealth profile and
that implied by the observed age-income profile together with some
reasonable assumptions about consumption patterns and bequest motives.
Yet these data are the observable outcomes of individual behavior within
a quite different socioeconomic environment, one that would hardly be

considered contemporary. In some ways, the consistency across a century
is comforting for our notions about the meaning of the underlying

"economic" behavior. But in other ways, the consistency ought to be a
bit discomforting. After all, this is an economy where formal education
mattered very little if at all.

It is also an economy where on-the-job

training was considerably less important than such training is in modern

industrial, technologically complex economies. Finally, labor—leisure
choices were less influential since this was a poor economy. Why then
do we observe an age-income profile? Moreover, why do we observe an
age-income profile that has such a contemporary appearance where, for
contemporary data, individual choices about education, on-the-job
training, and labor-leisure substitution are of much more importance?
We also find that the age—income life-cycle profile persists when
consideration is taken of individual differences, observed and

unobserved. Everyone appears to share a common age effect although

21

individual differences certainly lead to different incomes. Perhaps the
importance of biology has been underestimated. That is, it may be that
the age—income profile is primarily driven by depreciation that is
purely biological, having to do with a declining ability to work

intensely, physically or mentally. If this speculation were an accurate
description of the underlying cause of the age-income profile it has
strong implications for a society, like our contemporary one, where
there is a shift in the demographic profile of the population toward an

older population. It is possible, for example, for the decline in
productivity, which is after all some weighted average of the
productivity of the individuals of the society, to be explained by the
demographic shift which increases the weights for segments of the
population with lower productivity (because of vintage effects) and
declining productivity (because of age depreciation effects that are
reflected in the age-income profile).
